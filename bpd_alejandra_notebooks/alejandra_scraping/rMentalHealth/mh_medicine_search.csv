0,Fearful of Medicine,"I'm a 30 year old male. I've been working my ass off for a little over a decade now to stay afloat and I've climbed from homeless to a decent, albeit stressful job. I'm exhausted, I'm extremely burnt out, and I can't afford unpaid leave because my bills went up 40% in the last year. 

I'm scared to go to the doctor. I have a general anxiety disorder that's been assigned to me, and for the first time in my life I can recognise that I am very seriously depressed. I was diagnosed with ADHD (at the time it was ADD) at a young age and my parents being the geniuses that they were, considered it a fake diagnosis and never had me medicated. 


But my life is falling apart. I don't have the energy to do my job anymore, let alone chores and everything else. I'm entirely alone and I don't have anyone else I can depend on for anything. I'm scared of taking anti depressants or ADHD medicine. I don't want the side effects, I don't want to gain weight or lose libido or anything like that.  But I don't know what to do anymore. 

I'll take any advice. Be it related to medicine or otherwise. I'm quite lost with how to fix things.",1716331139.0,False,1,5,Saltsmith,None,1cxkz1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cxkz1h/fearful_of_medicine/
1,Fear of medicine,"Im 18y/o male, and i cannot stand medicine, prescription or not, i cant do it, i can barely take over the counter pain relievers myself, and absolutely cannot take my prescription heart medicine. My main problem with this is i am genuinely terrified of the people i love being on medication. I have had multiple experiences where medicine goes wrong, people chose it over me, i wasn’t told about it, ect. And it put a bad taste in my mouth from a young age, i cant be around drugs, i cant be around medicine.  My issue with this is my fiancé is having health issues and needs medicine. I feel like I’m being punched in the stomach every time it’s brought up. I know that its for the better, and its needed, but i cant get myself to be okay about it. Does anyone have advice??? Im not comfortable with exposure therapy or anything and I’ve talked to my therapist about this to no avail, it’s just really hard for me.",1715909233.0,False,0,1,Arachnabyss,None,1cttecx,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cttecx/fear_of_medicine/

7,Struggling with taking medicine,"Kinda ticked off with a friend of mine. We used to be super close but have grown apart.


I went to the psych hospital a while back, and ever since then, every time I mention something mental health related, he turns into a total ass. I said to him that I was looking at mushroom and ketamine therapy. He told me I didn’t need it, that my only problem was that I don’t have a purpose. He told me that only 1% of people diagnosed have what he claims as “real” depression. He said that it’s over diagnosed and that I only use it as an excuse to take pills as an escape, to get a fix.. If I was looking for a fix, I’d still be drinking, I’d still be doping. He talks to me like I’m not putting any effort into getting better. Was going to the hospital not trying to get better? Is taking my meds as prescribed not trying to get better? Is going to therapy once a week not trying to get better? Im sorry bro, but if my anxiety and depression isn’t real, your adhd isn’t real. (Both are very real)


It just sucks. It’s hard enough feeling like it’s ok to be medicated without someone saying you don’t need it. For somebody who has mental health struggles in his family, he sure is ignorant about all of it. Is it so wrong that I’m trying to find what works for me? I just want to feel ok. I know every day won’t be like walking on sunshine, but I shouldn’t have to feel awful all the time.


Anyway, my therapist told me there’s no shame in being medicated. We don’t shame people for using medicine when they get a cough, or some illness. Mental illness is no different. So if any of you struggle with feeling like it’s not ok to take your medicine, it is ok. It’s ok to not be ok, what matters is we keep trying to get better, because we deserve to be happy and to feel peace.

8,First time medicine,"I've recently started taking antidepressants and have been for about 3 months now. And I used to have bad spirals at night that was a combination of anxiety and depression. And at the end of my spirals my thoughts would just lead to one thoughts. That I would rather die. 
My medicine has stopped these spirals but I still get this suicidal ideation. But now it's occurring through the whole day sporadically. I don't have the deep falls anymore. Or I haven't experienced one yet, but I'm not sure if It's going to get better or stop these thoughts. Now my head seems all jumbled and my thoughts of sh haven't gone away either. In fact it feels as if they've increased. My anxiety has lessened and I don't find myself crying at night. But I get feelings of almost apathy with the underline of depressed and suicidal thoughts. They never go anywhere but are still active in my mind. It's like i trade my high anxiety for a lesser one but got a bigger portion of depression and other crap I can't name off the top of my head.

I’m supposed to take it tonight but i feel paralyzed by my fear of the possible side effects or one of them being long term. I forgot the name but I took a new medicine 5 years ago that affected my motor skills. Once I stopped that went away but part of me feels like it’s still there. I was learning the drums and suddenly felt like I got worse. It’s probably all in my head but I just can’t get myself to take the anafranil. Idk what to do. Am I overreacting? Thanks

Back in december my friend admitted himself to a mental hospital. After he got out they put him on lexapro and told him to get therapy. He took his medicine for about two weeks at most before quitting, and never scheduled therapy. He told me he quit his meds because they didnt work and made him feel worse. I have found out now that he has been drinking but i dont know for how long. He said hes started his medicine again a couple weeks ago, and he has told me hes drank a couple times while on it. 

Ive been hounding him about scheduling therapy and he just brushes me off and says goofy stuff back like he doesnt care.

13,The Promise and Perils of AI in medicine,"The idea of artificial intelligence has existed since 1955, when a few researchers first suggested looking into ""the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines.""  
  
While the promises are immense, there are also perils that demand our attention. Let's delve into the world of AI in medicine to understand both aspects.  
  
Promises of AI in Medicine:  
  
1. Enhanced Diagnostics:  
  
AI algorithms excel at analyzing vast amounts of medical data, aiding in quicker and more accurate diagnostics. This can lead to the early detection of diseases and improved treatment outcomes.  
  
2. Personalized Treatment Plans:  
  
By considering individual patient data, AI enables the creation of personalized treatment plans. This tailored approach can optimize the effectiveness of treatments while minimizing side effects.  
  
3. Streamlined Administrative Tasks:  
  
AI streamlines administrative processes, reducing the burden on healthcare professionals. This allows them to focus more on patient care, ultimately improving overall healthcare delivery.  
Perils of AI in Medicine:  
  
1. Data Privacy Concerns:  
  
The use of AI involves handling sensitive patient data. Striking a balance between utilizing this data for medical advancements and protecting patient privacy is a critical challenge.  
  
2. Bias in Algorithms:  
  
AI systems may inadvertently perpetuate biases present in the data they are trained on. This could result in unequal healthcare outcomes for different demographic groups, emphasizing the need for ongoing scrutiny and improvement.  
  
3. Dependence on Technology:  
  
Overreliance on AI can potentially lead to reduced clinical skills among healthcare professionals. Striking the right balance between human expertise and technological assistance is crucial.  
  
Conclusion:  
  
As we navigate the integration of AI into medicine, it's essential to remain vigilant about both the promises and the perils. Harnessing the potential of AI while addressing its challenges will pave the way for a healthcare landscape that is not only technologically advanced but also ethically sound and patient-centered.

15,Concierge medicine,"Anyone else think this concept is fucked up? I’ve been trying to find a PCP but it seems like it’s taken over where I live. How messed up is it to charge people literally thousands of dollars just so they can continue seeing their doctor? And it’s not covered by insurance? Even for the trade-off of having your doctor available “24/7” (which is literally impossible, doctors are people who need time off too), it doesn’t seem worth it. What better way to exclude poor people from getting proper healthcare, right?

I have such bad anxiety now that my doctors will switch over to concierge medicine like my family’s doctor, whom we’d been going to for years, has. Now I can’t see her without paying over 2k a year for a membership.

Whenever I look up concierge medicine, it’s all articles and comments praising it. Am I alone in thinking it’s messed up?

18,"How to cope with exhaustion, depression and loneliness without medicine?","I'm not stupid, just have really difficult situation. Let me explain. 

I have depression from 2018 and diagnosed in this spring. This is really ruined my life, because I hadn't even chance on support from somebody. I had bad childhood, my needs were not being met. All my hell life I do that other need from me (go to school, help with household tasks, go to work) and in free time I just consume games, films, youtube, networks and often obsessive daydream about sweet future. Last year I had hard phase caused difficult situation in my country (hello from Ukraine) and family (war made me live with them). Now I found work and this is good, but I feel so exhaustion. And earlier I felt exhaustion, when I do nothing or live in better situation on some period. Now I even don't play games or watch something, I have 8 hours work day: before work I lay and try to distract in internet, 4 hours work, lunch and listen music, 4 hours work, listen music. I can't even cook for myself anything. Yes, take medicine in all will be good. I took and my life pattern doesn't change and now I have health problem cause allergic reaction caused by AD and this is even don't start on beginning, after 3 weeks. I really need strong support for changing my life. I feel that my lifestyle ruin me more than my brain hormonal disbalance, but I can't change it myself.   


I must to notice, right now I HAVEN'T friends, supporter, HAVEN'T way to find somebody in IRL or internet, CAN'T do it with my family (because they dumb and ruined my dumb life), plus I HAVEN'T money on therapy or way to take free.   


Only what I want it do something that I like and want. How you cope with exhaustion? Rest doesn't help because I burn out by inactivity. I had coping mechanism, when talk with my friend everyday, but it was bad. I was productive, but when I  lost communication I lost all my productivity. I just can't fore myself to do my own preferences.   
Now I have daily schedule, but this is minimum task that I must to do to keep alive, I can't add something more to this, because I feel pain of powerlessness, can't handle and can't do it.   


Honestly maybe I really stupid dumb, because this is like ""how to get home without money, friend and even haven't hands, guys?""

21,"ADHD medicine has profoundly benefitted my life, but it has been taken illicitly.","I'll try to make this short. I got into a rather prestigious university after HS (largely from my SAT scores), but struggled with studying and adapting to university life. I couldn't focus, and forcing my brain to read dozens of textbook pages was pure torture and my retention of the info was poor. I made it a year and a half before having to drop out. I felt like I had lost hope of ever accomplishing anything. I couldn't keep my room clean, couldn't force myself to do the tasks I needed to do and allowed my self pity and wallowing to lead me to some drug use here and there that ended up on my medical records.  
After years of introspection, reading PubMed articles, taking tests online, and eventually reading the DSM IV (I can focus on things that interest me) to try and pinpoint my issues I came to the understanding that I likely have high functioning Autism (Aspergers) and ADHD. Both of these disorders are present in my family, untreated however. I have been clean from any ""recreational"" drug use for several years, but not having insurance, and having a tainted record I felt like any substantive treatment for ADHD would never be possible (knowing the research shows how ineffective the alternatives to stimulants are). So I bought some Adderall (confirmed to be real and not street product) to see if it could improve my life.  
And oh my goodness did it. I got promoted at my lowly job, I got organized, fixed my credit score, started saving money, and eventually started taking online classes and got a 4.0 GPA. Got accepted back into university, and now I'm consistently getting the top test grades for several of my very difficult and challenging statistics and high-level accounting classes. I've never abused the medication. Never. Take a consistent 30mg 4-5 times weekly. I now feel like I can make something of my life, and maybe get into law school. It makes me want to cry realizing how easier things would've been for me had my parents not been the type to say ""medicating kids for ADHD is for lazy parents..."" I have something to lose now too though, and don't want to buy this from a sketchy dealer anymore. In fact, I refuse to. But at the same time I don't want to revert back into the mess of my old life. I'm thinking of visiting a psychiatrist, but feel like they will judge me. I'm also afraid that my troubled past will lead them to not trust me and think I'm just a junkie trying to get high. I don't think I'll ever realize my dreams untreated, but treatment feels so unattainable. It's soul crushing. If I do go to a psychiatrist and get tested I will be 100% truthful, I don't want to delude myself or taint my results. But I feel rather strongly that I have this condition.

28,How to change one's attitude towards medicine?,"Hi there, as the title says, I'm looking for a piece of advice on how to change one's - in this case my - attitude towards psychiatric medication. Which is currently very bad.

I don't even know where to start.

I'm mentally ill and I made an appointment with a psychiatrist. It's going to be extremely difficult for me, since I'm kind of afraid of doctors, there were many times when my problems and me myself were belittled by them, and some time ago, when I decided to finally go to a psychiatrist for the first time I ended up being traumatised by the visit (I made an appointment with another doctor this time). There's another thing which is going to make things even more difficult, which is my bad, very bad attitude towards drugs used in psychiatry.

I can't imagine myself taking any of them. When there appears a thought in my mind about a necessity to be put onto some medicine, my immediate reaction is: ""No, no, NO, I DON'T WANT TO!"". I'm deadly afraid of taking them. When things are really bad I even feel really uncomfortable when one of my close friends, who currently is under psychiatric care themselves, brings up this topic. Or I see them swallowing their pills (I can feel my stomach getting tight then). I'm genuinely bewildered when they say they want to be on meds, even though they need to take them literally until the end of their life (like??? How???). Even though they gave me a lot of support, described me how it feels being medicated, and showed me their drugs it still tends to be difficult for me.

At the same time I know there's literally no other way. I'm aware that these meds are going to help me, that there are going to be some side effects (which I will be able to freely discuss with the doctor), there will probably be some experimenting until final diagnosis or finding the drug that works for me (which is normal), it's only up to me whether I will be taking them or not and I can stop it and stop visiting the doctor anytime, the visits are going to get more rare, and I'm going to get a lot of support from my close ones if I need it. But there's still this ""no, no NO!"" reaction in my mind. I'm slowly running out of ideas on how to talk to myself and change my attitude. I literally feel like crying when describing this issue.

Psychotherapy is currently out of the question for me, since I can't and probably won't be able to afford it in both closer and further future. So I won't be able to seek professional help when it comes to convincing me to take prescribed medications.

I'm perfectly aware that if I wanted to be mean, I could say something like: ""I don't want to and probably intentionally won't take prescribed drugs, so (please) do something about it"" during the visit, but it's no doctor's responsibility to reason with me - it's my and only my job to talk things through with myself. Furthermore, I would just make their job more difficult, since how they are going to find out if something is actually working on me or not or if their previous assumptions were right if I don't cooperate. And working with me is going to be difficult already, because of my past experiences with doctors and I wouldn't like to make it worse.

I'm kind of stuck and don't know what to do. I still feel scared when I think about the visit itself, let alone taking medication afterwards. I'd really appreciate if you shared your thoughts regarding this matter.",1689858794.0,False,1,2,BigEyedS,None,154qlg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/154qlg9/how_to_change_ones_attitude_towards_medicine/
29,"How can you decently identify & process your problems, so you know what medicine you should get?","Long story short, been dealing with mental health issues (depression, anxiety, anger issues, suicidal thoughts, etc) for about 7 years  and im 22M now. I have only specifically told 2 people in my life about this, although many friends could probably gather the info pretty easily, never told family, and only recently told a specialist doctor about 2 weeks ago.

I would like to get some type of medication to make myself finally feel better, but without the advice of a psychiatrist and involving my dumb PCP, how can I figure out what I need so I can just tell him? I am scared to try SSRIs again because studies show seratonin has little to do with depression, and I took some for about a month last year and I had to stop because of side effects, some of which I think I still suffer from.

I struggle with debilitating anxiety and OCD. It has been a long journey (several years), and I have tried MANY medications and have been to MANY types of therapy.

I am currently taking medication and I’m in therapy. I have done CBT and ERP. I have done two rounds of TMS. I have tried keto (but not for an extended period of time). I have removed sugar from my diet, and I get enough sleep and I drink enough water. I have tried A LOT of supplements.

41,Psych says I need therapy for taking medicine dose she prescribed and overdosing. Sad medical world.,"Okay. So I'm kinda wondering if anyone has had this experience with this or another med. 

I was on 100mg of modafinil for for about two weeks for chronic fatigue and insomnja and psych said it would help with ADHD treatment. First two weeks were great. I slept for the first time through the night in two years without being in chronic pain and all over more happy and productive. 

Two weeks in, my dose got upped to 200 mg of modafinil by mouth each morning. 

The second day I started getting sick. Nausea, lots of vomiting and diarrhea. I was in a mental fog and couldn't figure out anything. I stopped feeling hungry or thirsty.  Even how to get dressed. The third day I stopped taking it and still felt terrible. 

Day four I go to the hospital for dehydration and can't retain fluids. They do a covid test give me a bag of saline and send me home.

Next day, I thought maybe having withdrawal so I took one dose, day five video with medical Dr. States upper respiratory infection. Surprised no xray with wheezing and congestion. Prescribed nebulizer 

Fast forward. By day six of being awake, and seejng my Dr in person, I was told they can't do anything and to just treat cold symptoms. 

That evening my son put his booger fingers in my food I wanted to try and eat and massive painful tics began. My husband didnt know why I appeared to have severe form of autism. Lots of tics and stimming and contorting and hitting myself but in repetition and I was whistling and humming. Nightmare.
. This lasted 9 hours and i passed out for a half hour and then tics continued the next day. 

The whole time my psych and Dr say I am fine. Now the symptoms and then tics. I've never experienced something so painful and I have daily chronic pain. 

I ended up putting (thc) in the coffepot with lavender and camomile tea and almost breaking the thing and getting help from the amazing husband to brew it and it finally calmed as I drank and spilled it on myself. My Dr gave me permission to take one of my old clonopin for sleep the seventh day. I seen a golden angel as I passed out crying thankful and thanking my mother in heaven. 

Two days in (day 9) i told her I was having some nerve issues in my face. When I asked her if she knew why this happened and why I don't feel okay my psychiatrist told me I needed therapy and only wanted benzos. Assuming cause I have three years in recovery. Mind you I have 120 clonopin from 6months ago still when it got discontinued cause I asked and tapered cause I was having a baby, after being on it for seven years 

Come to find out two weeks after the onset I overdosed and she had no clue why. When  I told her to do research about my symptoms she was appalled that I suggest educating and putting down her DSM 5 book. 

Its been a rough time. I tried to type the best I could and I couldn't drive for about a week in a half at all or have coordination. It's been a long rough road. I'm disappointed once again in the discrimination of people in recovery, and that my Dr flat out told me I need therapy because she ""don't have a darn clue what's going on with you honestly"" two days before. 

Has anyone has had med included tics? I took the prescribed amount too. 

Now back to insomnia and chronic pain, and I think I damaged my body or back cause now I can't hold my blatter and when I go it's not much my right forearm has been swelling, still short of breath after three weeks and on nebulizer.

The standard dizziness, headaches, and amplification of depression and anxiety are there, but I am also experiencing frequent nausea and, in the past day or two, auditory hallucinations. I understand that the worsening of symptoms might be caused by extra stress in my personal life, but it would be dishonest to suggest that this hasn't all been terrifying. 

I am sure that I'll feel fine after a few more weeks, but hearing voices is always such an unsettling symptom, no matter what causes it. I find myself looking around a lot, attempting to locate the source, only to see that there is nobody nearby, or at least nobody with those voices. 

While it is unlikely that I will freak out or anything in public, I still worry about this specific symptom. 

I'm not asking for help, to be honest. I just needed to vent, as I'm worried.

\- Prozac 60 mg w/breakfast

\- Effexor 300mg w/dinner

\- Xanax 0.5 mg twice a day

\- Seroquel 25mg at night

\- Valium 5 mg if needed

\- Celebrex 200mg twice a day

He started on low doses but quickly ramped it up. I've been on this for a month now.

The first month I was seeing improvements. More fatigue but less panic and willing to go out more and drive further. The second month was getting better until halfway. I got plagued with derealization, migraines, and severe diziness. Tried to shake it off but so far still have them.

Also for the last 3 weeks I've got inflammation all over my body and joints. I feel like I'm being bound down. It aches to move. Feels like my joints are locked and I'm so tense 24/7.

I saw a Rheumatologist for the joint and body pain and got a cortisone shot to help relieve it. No effect really. Celebrex is barely helping.

Do you think this could be side effects from all of these meds? Am I just supposed to ride it out? Have the Benzos stopped working for anxiety? I also take Paracetamol on top of all this if I reach to a point where I can't handle my head exploding.

47,"Do you lean towards traditional medicine for treatment, or are you open to the holistic approach?","I want your honest opinion. I am considering becoming a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner instead of a psychologist mainly because I want to prescribe if needed, and be able to provide holistic approaches to treating mental health. I understand that everyone has different needs, so I would like to learn how to properly treat my patients in a way that tailors to their specific circumstances. 

I view our bodily systems as a whole rather than separate. I would love to break those barriers within our medical system, providing the most comprehensive support. 

First I would like to provide psychodynamic therapy gaining enough credentials so that I can work with my patients all together rather than pushing a pill, assessing for 15 minutes then sending them to a social worker. 

I would want to run necessary lab work going as far as genetic testing and find out if there are any deficiencies  that could be causing any distress in the body, as well for proper medicine treatments. For example women with endometriosis, suffer with severe depression, and anxiety. Most of the time they get prescribed an SSRI, when in reality, they are suffering with a hormonal imbalance. I for one was just recently diagnosed, and my therapist prior kept pushing anti-depressants because my mood was irregular.

Well when you deal with debilitating pain, you're not going to be happy, no matter how much therapy you get. When I saw a functional medicine doctor, she ran a hormonal panel, gut microbiome test and noticed I wasn't producing any cortisol, dopamine, and had adrenal fatigue, (along with other findings such as low progesterone, testosterone etc).

If I didn't discover those irregularities that were conflicting my body I would have just avoided the big elephant in the room and taken a pill. Unfortunately our medical system doesn't have the time to investigate. Since this discovery, I have been on supplementation, just had a laparoscopy, and am on a holistic regime to balance my hormones.  

I am on my way to balance. And I really want to provide that approach when dealing with patients rather than checking off boxes in the dsm-5 and giving you a pill.   

If all else is well with a patient after testing, and they do check off those boxes in the dsm-5 then I will prescribe medication to address their condition. 

Is this something you would value as a patient seeking help? I am considering this for grad school, but I know this route is a bit unconventional. I know one day I will have to open my own practice in order to fully provide the care I am passionate about.

What have I done in my past life to deserve such pain? I ask myself every day. I cry myself to sleep for nearly more than 2 years silently on the bed.

I was suicidal and my mental health was on the verge. I used to want to die every day. It's embarrassing to say that this went on for a few years, I wanted to seek help and a therapist but if you get to find out the school will most likely kick you out. Under the reasons of ""unfit"".

I am better now, however, I have many classes that I need to redo, which will postpone my graduation for another year, I am getting my whitecoat soon, but I feel a sense of repulse since I feel like I am in the wrong place. My ranks are bottom tier, and I haven't studied for the board exam yet. I live in anxiety every day. I am on the road to healing but I feel like there is also no time.

On the other hand, I am aware that my love for medicine has completely burnt out a long time ago and realize that I am also just doing this under parental pressure.",1652799011.0,False,2,2,BobaPizza,None,uro5ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/uro5ek/depress_in_medicine/

Probably a year and a half. Everyday the same. I used to be full of love and anxiety.

I feel like can't do it anymore. I can't function in life. All because I made decision to take these pills I didn't need at the time. :(

55,Medicines I took permanently changed my brain,"Hi I talked and all. As I understand the medicines/drugs I took permanently changed my brain for the worst. I can not undo. I took on different days: amtiriptyline 10mg once, pregabalin 25mg once, diazepam 2mg once, and zolpidem 10mg on 5 nights, diphenhydramate 50mg on 5 nights. I also took different brands of birth control on and off but I am not sure as this seems less likely to cause permanent brain changes. 

I know my brain has changed. It's been year and half, probably linger. Always fog. Started with the moodswings and all. Sigh. I am sick and tired. I took these drugs and ruined my brain and life. I can never be the same again. Remember how anxious and excited I used to be to be a part of this world. These days I can't even feel fear or anything. I think of killing myself because I changed my brain with these drugs and I don't seem to care about living anymore. I can try antidepressants but a lot of the time I think what is the point when I will never be the person I used to be and probably end up with tremors, tinnitus, and hopefully not but maybe some horrible person. Some doctors and people say these drugs shouldn't have changed my brain, especially since I took them short-term. 

I really don't know who to talk to. I just talk to AI bots and they tell me that the medications probably changed my brain. I have seen some people on youtube who have taken the medications and they seem okay. I just wish someone knew the truth or my brain would be like it was. But these are both impossible. I feel so hurt. I think about if I had never taken these drugs, I had been so great and full of life.

68,What medicine could stop severe anxiety in a crisis?,"I am an anxious person.. always have been. I overthink everything all the time. There are things I am doing to help myself but thats not what this post is about. 

I know this may sound silly to some, but I know there is going to come a time, or very likely come a time, when I will know that I am shortly about to die. I do not have the view of some that when Im old Ill be happy to die.. I never ever want to die and have no belief in any afterlife (which will not change).. I literally dread the idea of dying every day. 

Now lately with this war, I am in the UK and russia made a video saying how the UK is being stupid because all it takes is one missile from them and they can wipe out our whole continent.. so I am absolutely terrified that putin will nuke us. I am in london aswell so I would definately die. The idea of hearing a large explosion and then waiting for a wave of fire to kill me is horrifying.

I want to know if there is any drug I can take, in a worst case scenario.. Only when I know I am just about to die.. (either by old age, a war, anything).. that would completely take away my anxiety about it? and make me forget about it? I know we are all going to die.. and as much as I can hope that I can live long enough for them to change the lifespan.. thats unlikely.. so Im wondering if there is some pill or something I can keep with me at all times that will calm me if a situation happens where I am waiting for my death?

I get scared as hell just thinking about it.. and I cant imagine the sheer horror I will feel if something happens one day and I know that Im going to die within a few minutes or an hour or something. I know some may think its not right to bury emotions with drugs, but honestly if im about to die and a pill can make me not care that Im about to die.. then I need to have that pill on me at all times. It would honestly give me so much relief just knowing I wont have to experience the fear of the impending death when it happens. Obviously there will be times where I could die and wouldnt have enough time.. but theres also a lot of times where it would help.. especially just when I get old eventually and know that its coming very soon.

82,Music is medicine,"With respect I hope I can share my journey.

I’ve dealt with mental health issues all my life and I had a severe mental breakdown in 2016 and have been rebuilding my life slowly ever since. Due to this breakdown I lost all my creativity and have spent the past 4 years in and out of hospital and receiving therapeutic treatments for my mental health.
 
Since then I have been having music tuition and artist development twice a week, this has included having vocal, guitar, studio recording time and songwriting sessions.

Music has been one of my most important therapies, it has helped to heal my soul and has given me a purpose in life, a musical release, that for so many long dark years I did not have, I didn’t lose it. It was hibernating, and I’m able to tune into that creative realm again which I’m grateful.
 
With this support and encouragement, I have returned to fully re-embracing my love of songwriting, and have started to develop some songs about my journey, I have discovered my own voice capacity, and I'm working towards live performance and studio work.

For myself, this has been the pathway back home to me. Back to a life of purpose and future with meaning. Through recording and performing these songs I aim to positively impact the lives of others who have experienced mental health difficulty and be a positive
role model of recovery.
 
I hope to help others with mental health difficulty return to the life of meaning that
they desire and deserve. Additionally, I would like to utilize the exposure I gain through
performance to cultivate awareness of music therapy and creation as a pathway, and tool,for mental health recovery. 

A pathway that is little known, but as is evident as my example so far, has been life-changing.

Music is medicine for me. I have come so far musically, emotionally and I’m now writing my own journey with my music. I plan to fly where only dreamers fly. I’m putting in the hard steps to make this happen.

Mental Health is an unseen disability and one that a lot of people don’t recognize and that, even in today’s progressive society, still has a lot of stigma attached to it. 

I want to be able to help people like myself with mental illness, families, carers and the wider population, realise that reaching out and starting the recovery path, can with a lot of hard work and supports be so rewarding.

I wrote a song called The Dreamer which can be heard on jango radio

85,Felt like I was treated bad today by my medicine prescriber,"So I get to the mental health clinic at the time I was supposed to be there today. I sit in the waiting room about 5 minutes,  then I'm called back by the medical assistant to have my vitals done. 
She takes my vitals and then shows me where to sit while I wait for my medicine prescriber .
2 minutes pass by and then my medicine prescriber comes out and says ""are you waiting for me?"" I said ""yes. ""
She responds in a grouchy voice ""well why are you sitting down there?""
I replied ""this is where the medical assistant told me to sit.""
She then responds ""well everytime you come , you need to sit down here by my office""
I respond "" it all looks the same to me back here""
She then replied "" you need to learn to pay attention to your surroundings""
She was not laughing or smiling , or saying it in a joking matter. 
I then follow her back to her office and the first thing she says to me is
""Why are you trying to change your diagnosis? You're schizoeffective , not schizophrenic.""

Here's the thing. I never tried to change my diagnosis. I thought she originally diagnosed me with schizophrenia,  because many doctors from other health care facilities diagnosed me with it. Anyways , what i actually filled out paperwork for was for a release of information. No where on any of the papers that I signed did I say change my diagnosis. 
All I said was I needed proof that I had been diagnosed and what I was diagnosed with. 


Now onto more rudeness from her..
She asks if I'm still taking abilify,  even though she should have knew that i wasn't ,because I had told her over 2 months ago that I stopped taking it. ( I see her every 6 weeks). She then asked me if I'm still taking seraquil.  I told her yes , but I'm only taking half of 300mg , so 150mg. She asked why. I told her that anything over 200mg made me black out/pass out. She then goes on to say how I shouldn't be breaking it up like that , but then goes on to suggest that I should use a pill cutter.

She also upped my Buspar by 10mg per day. Even though i told her i was doing just fine. Ugh.

87,I don't want to take my medicine anymore,"At the start of the year I started seeing a therapist for my depression. I'd been hiding it for roughly 10 years or so. It became too much for me to handle. I started drinking, I rarely ate, I never left my room, I just lost all motivation in general. Every night I wished I'd fall asleep and never wake up again. A few months later I started experiencing hallucinations. I would hear sounds others wouldn't. Voices would talk to me and talk to each other. Each voice was distinctive. They'd have accents, use certain vocabulary, talk about different things. They would always ask me if I'm dead yet, and they'd tell me to kill myself or kill other people. They said they wanted me dead so they could leave. They were stuck in my head, stuck with me. I would imagine I was somebody else, and would experience emotions from events that I made up in my head. I saw a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with bipolar psychosis and an anxiety disorder and started taking medication. It took a while until we found the right ones. I rarely hallucinate these days. But I feel nothing anymore. I'm not happy, I'm not sad, just nothing. I experience moments of sadness or happiness, but it's never a lasting feeling. I don't want to take my medication anymore. All of these problems seemed so real but now it feels as though they never happened in the first place. My medication gives me nightmares every night, but because of the medicine I don't ever wake up. I go from one violent and graphic nightmare to another until my alarm for work goes off.

88,My sister has a psychotic disorder but does not take her medicine,"I need help because I don't know what to do. 

She thinks she is being followed by people all the time. She thinks someone is listening to her and might harm her and many more thoughts similar to those. 

 She was doing her doctorate in Neuro Science and according to her she started taking Ketamine for some reason. We think that she had some depression because of her not being able to graduate and decided to take Ketamine for it. This might be the reason she is in this situation. 

We tried to bring to to multiple doctors (psychologists) and she wouldn't listen to any of them because she thinks she knows better than all of them. After talking to bunch of her close friends and her professors, we had no choice but to put her in a psychiatric facility forcefully for a month.

After she got out she was fine for a while, but there were some medicine she had to take which she never took them after a few days. After a year or so leaving the hospital she is back at where she was before. Her thoughta are back and she is blaming us for everything. If she doesn't start taking her medicine, things will get worse. My and my family don't know what to do in this situation but she thinks she is not sick therefore she has no reason to take any medicine. 

But she talks about how her phone calls are being recorded. She is being followed by authorities. Her ex my kill her. Cops are watching her. People who live in her apartment building are torturing people and we should believe everything she says otherwise we are her enemy.

99,Mental Health in Medicine,"This COVID-19 pandemic is putting a lot of strain in the mental health of our medical professionals, causing burnout and the tragic loss of Dr. Lorna Breen, an NYC ER doctor, by suicide in April.

Did you know that physicians have double the rate of suicide compared to the general population? Today is National Physician Suicide Awareness Day, a reminder that we must do more to support the mental health of physicians.

When 44% of physicians are burned out and 300+ physicians die by suicide every year, mental health should be a huge priority in the field of medicine. Instead we see a culture of silence, in which physicians keep their mental health struggles under the radar to escape scrutiny by licensing boards, residency programs, employers or even their peers, or when mental health issues may be seen as red flags by adcoms for those aspiring to enter the medical profession. Breaking this culture of silence is the first step in dismantling stigma.

That’s why it’s so important to share your story – Medical Minds Matter is a place where physicians and pre-med/medical students can share their mental health struggles with the option of staying anonymous because we want to include even those that are not willing to do so publicly.

100,Sharing one of my experiences with medicine,"Today I forgot to take my meds, normally I take one half of a pill of Escitalopramum and half of a pill of risperidonum, in the morning and another half of a pill of risperidonum in the evening. Today I forgot to take the morning portion of meds and the effect I noticed was that today I ate JUST one pack of chips and some cookies, for the entire day and I wasnt at all hungry. It was a weird feeling because normally I consume two dinner size meals a day or smth, and it has bern showing on my weight. now I took the medicine I forgot about and in half an hour I became super hungry. I kinda feel calmed knowing that my unhealthy eating habits are just my medicine. Ive been having alot of intrusive thoughts about my weight, mostly because I always have been skinny and my dad is one of these people who will constantly mention my weight and comment on it, Its really painful when I hear this, because its not my fault that I am this hungry. (Technically its fault of my dad because alot of his actions led me to a situation where I am taking these meds). Now that I think about it, I already went through the same thing a year or two ago, when I first started taking Risporidonum, and started becoming obese aswell, then my psychiatrist took me off these meds, and my weight became normal. My conclusion here is that your psychiatrist always wants the best for you, so its very important to always provide him with any problems youre having. Otherwise you might end up unnecesarily dealing with side effects even though the med you are taking can be easily replaced.

101,As needed anxiety medicine,"Hello everyone, this is my first post on here and I hope it’s relevant.

I was stalked and raped violently 6 years ago causing obvious trauma and a diagnosis of ptsd. After a couple years of partying the pain away I started having bad anxiety attacks. I was prescribed Zoloft and saw a therapist steadily which really helped for a couple more years until very recently some other terrible things involving family happened and I can only assume triggered my anxiety to a whole other level. My GP prescribed me trazodone for my nightmares.

Fast forward a couple months and anxiety attacks here and there, I went to the ER one night thinking I was having a seizure but was simply given a Valium (which worked amazingly) and was told I had an anxiety attack. This one was just bigger and more horrible than before, maybe because it was so bad it outdid my years of Zoloft use? Idk, Anyway... I had since been having vicious panic attacks at least 4 days a week and it is ruining my work and social life.

I went to my GP and told her what happened in the ER and my daily debilitation and straight up asked for something “as needed” while me and my therapist worked out some more knots in my head and heart. She prescribed me Buspirone and upped my Zoloft.

It’s been a couple days and I had a terrible anxiety attack that i took the Buspirone for but had no relief. Which obviously made things worse for the attack and am now here on reddit 4 am in the west coast pretty desperate for advice.

I never wanted to be on any daily medication in the first place. I’m a very attracted to nature and things of authenticity but with ptsd things aren’t the way I wish, which I accept. My therapist (who I adore and owe my life, honestly) thinks I don’t need medication and has always thought so but is only a psychologist so can’t really weigh in too much on that.

All my GP seems to do is put me on more and more medication that makes me feel concerned for my actual healing; how am I supposed to heal my soul and heal naturally through therapy while I’m doped up the whole time? I know she means no harm but I believe we have different ideas of my mental health journey. So I want to ween off everything I’m on and simply have a TRUE as needed medication that can kill the attacks while I work things out authentically with my therapist... like instead of trimming my issues slightly everyday by taking chemical reactors, I want to remove the skin altogether that keeps me so jailed. 

I want to get a second opinion with another doctor and have a few questions:

1) should I see another GP or go straight to a psychiatrist?

2) what as needed medication is best for massive anxiety attacks?

3) am I totally out of touch and should just trust my current GP?

4) is it appropriate to straight up ask for a benzo or should I just tell my story and wishes without specific demands? Will i sound like a druggie???

I know this is a lot and bless your soul for reading it all. I’m so desperate I sometimes feel my life is on the line when really I just want to LIVE. 
Thank you!

107,Medicine Withdrawal Help,"Located in US/South Louisiana

I'm having some issues with medicine withdrawals, and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice or can help.

When I went to see my psychiatrist Thursday, he recommended getting off of Zoloft and then starting Cymbalta. However, he wanted to taper off of 200mg to 100mg for a week and then nothing at all, while starting the Cymbalta simultaneously.

I tried it on Saturday, and I've been experiencing so many side effects, predominantly nausea/vomiting, dizziness, brain fog, and brain zaps. I called the doctor's office yesterday, and he wants to taper off of the medicine slower - start taking 150 instead of 100 for a week, and then taper down by 50 each week while continuing the Cymbalta. He also prescribed some anti-nausea medicine.

Today's the first day on the 150s, and I possibly feel worse now than I did before. I haven't really eaten much due to the nausea and my various stomach issues, and the anti-nausea medicine isn't working today. I'm so dizzy and can't really function very well.

Making it even worse, my depression and anxiety have come back in full force.

Any advice on how long this lasts or what I can do? I've found ice chips to be super helpful to keep down liquids, but I don't know what else to do.

117,Best way to track my medicine AND mood?,"Was wanting to know if anyone had suggestions on the best way (or even any way because I simply cannot think of a great one), to track the medicine I'm taking (for ADHD), the dosages and times etc, and (almost most importantly) the effect it has. 

The reason is because I have days where the effects are mostly desirable, and then I'll have days where symptomatically things go a bit (a bit is quite an understatement) awry. 

I'm struggling to simplify a way to track this, because of how many factors change on the daily, for example did I eat before? How much time elapsed between doses? What time of day did I take it? How did I feel? 

I guess to further clarify, I understand I could write it down, but would it be easy to start noticing patterns with so many changing factors? Just curious to see if anyone has a method that works for them, or, perhaps (and likely), I'm just overthinking the entire thing.

120,I think my medicines are interacting negatively.,"I 38. I am on Adderral 30mg XR for my ADHD. I am also on Metformin for pre diabetes . And Fluvoxamine 100mg for OCD/intrusive thoughts. I was also on Lisinopril with the water pill additive bit that made me very dizzy in the evening. So my doc swapped it with normal lisinopril. 

I have complex sleep apnea and have been exhausted every morning. I’ve also barely been able to focus as well during the day. And I nap because I don’t sleep well but then I’m up late. And the cycle repeats. 
I also had been in a real bad funk for a while and can’t ever be “present”. My mind is always racing and I’m never relaxed. 

My sleep doc said my sleep machine results are really good so she doesn’t think my apnea is causing the exhaustion and inability to focus. 

So my primary care also gave me Wellbutrin 150mg. 

Since taking the Wellbutrin and Lisinopril (started at same time 1 week ago), I have been super super exhausted. Like I could sleep all day. I have also felt in a stupor.

124,Possible Lamotrigine or other medicine interactions/withdrawl symptoms. In a bad place mentally.,"I'm sorry if this is a long post but I'm looking for any support until I hear from my doctor...

Hello everyone! I just joined this forum recently. I have a few mental health issues including bipolar, sensory issues, adhd, depression and anxiety. While I am waiting for doctor answers, I have some questions and concerns about a few medications I was on. I'm wondering if anyone has known someone or themselves have experienced any related symptoms or happen to know a doctor with answers. 

The 16th of December I started my medications of 25mg of Lamotrigine once a day, Memantine10mg once a day, Magnesium, B6 and Niacin. I felt my bipolar and anger issues start to get a little better within 2 weeks. Ok great! 

Well as prescribed I had to start taking Memantine twice a day 6 days later: no issues seemed to occur. Lamotrigine twice a day 2 weeks after my first dose. The week of January 3rd I noticed, and others that I began to act very hyper compared to normal and I noticed throughout the week a rapid heart rate. Normally I am in the low 70s but now it sometimes ran 95 or more! Somewhere in there I began getting light headed and dizzy. Concerned, on the 6th I called my doctor to lower the dose of Lamotrigine because CVS mentioned those could be side effects as well as the FDA. Luckily I was only supposed to be on thus for only a month, if that is what is causing the symptoms I'm about to describe. The 11th was my last dose. But I am still not sure if it's the Lamotrigine or Memantine which I am now going through tapering back to one a day at night. The FDA does say Lamotrigine stays in your system for 14 days roughly. 

So what's been happening is, I will feel lightheaded and dizzy at different points throughout the day. Sort of, 'out of it' a little shake but not actually shake. It seems like a blur, but I am not 100% sure it it happened while I was still on my 2 Lamotrigine a day or when started the lower dose. The dizziness also feels like an anxiety of sorts. I still feel like I have rapid heart rate, but I did go to my primary care and during the 15 minutes there they said my heart rate was fine. It seems better than when I was on the medication twice a day...but still makes me nervous. It also feels like I am disconnected from the world around me, as if im about to pass out from not eating enough? Maybe vertigo? Almost And a nonstop anxious feeling. Its so hard to describe. 

The weirdest symptoms that just began happening a few days ago, is while I am driving. No idea if this is related or something else completely. I began to feel a little lightheaded and a vertigo feeling, then extremely anxious. Even at a stop light or stop sign sitting still. During that I start to have a sinus head pressure and difficulty breathing. 

I'm wondering if anyone has experienced anything like this, or knows someone who has...and what I can do until I hear from my doctor. I know both medications have strange side effects on and with withdrawl. Is it withdrawl I'm feeling or did the medications do something bad? And here I thought I was going to finally have my mental health under control...only to spiral into this weirdness I keep feeling.

128,I'm trying to understand why my friend won't take her medicine after all these years.,"Hello, my friend has depression for years now. She had a... violent childhood and obviously has/ acquired trauma from it. I met her back on 2010 at church with her adoptive family. Since then, I am aware of her self- harming tendencies, her attempts at suicide and every single time she lapses into a depressive state (which worsens and get better and worsens again over and over throughout the years--- I know enough now that it does happen quite a lot to people with depression). Now, she's been on a lot of therapies.   


But, I don't think she actually ever wanted to be in one(?). She never lasted in each Psychiatrist and Psychologist she met. Her longest is probably her very recent one, which is four months, before ultimately discontinuing that therapy too. On top of that, she never took her meds seriously. She either missed it, skipped it or intentionally doesn't take it on time or day. Her mom took it upon herself to set an alarm and remind her personally to take her meds. When my friend is at work, her mom will call her to take her meds (but, would you understand if I say that whenever she's at work, we worry that she's not taking her meds at all?).   


But yeah, you get the picture. Mind you, we don't force her to go to therapy because we feel like it would make her turn away from getting help more. Even her very first one, she's the one who told her parents that she would like to go and meet a doctor--- but as I said, she never lasted nor took the given medicine to her seriously.   


She did admit to me though, that she does so because she doesn't want to worry or disappoint her parents (which are actually her own biological Aunt and her husband). They adopted her, and she feels like the least she can do is to lessen their worry about her and try to get herself together by going to these therapies... which obviously, hasn't work out until now.  


Last year when on lockdown, and during a particularly bad depressive mood/episode of hers, I finally asked the questions I've been wondering all these years, ""Your parents keep taking you to these psychiatrists and psychologists and on top of that they are vey supportive by buying you those very expensive medicines (because they are really expensive no joke) but you never really took them. WHY? I thought you want to feel better, to be better! You know those medicines would help you, right? As well as those therapies. So why???""    


What she told me has been stuck in my mind, ""Those medicines they gave me are for crazy people. And I am NOT crazy.""   


Apparently she looked up her medicine in the internet and arrived at that conclusion. Now, I don't know about much medicine but I do know those will help her stabilize her moods and are not exclusively for ""crazy people.""   


Now, I don't know. Last month, she had another bad episode. Honestly, I am tired, I'm sure she is too. It's a cycle: she feels good, and the next she feels like she wants to die and disappear. I don't know what else to tell her. She says she wants to be well... but at this point I don't see that in her. These therapies, those medicines and even her family and friend's support... she keeps throwing it all away- or I feel like, she keep throwing all of those away, and maybe I am tired as I write this, but I feel like she does that because I don't know, she stubborn and prideful and she wants to do her own way but it's not like she's going to be magically healed on her own right??? Or maybe she does that because she just simply and truly wants to die and I don't know how would I feel about that. I don't want her to die, and I've been stopping her for years. Sometimes I think I'm the selfish one here, should I just let her do what she wants then? Slash her wrists so deep or let her jump on oncoming traffic? What right do I even have to keep her alive if she wants to die?????   


Most of the time though, and I never did say to her because again, I don't want to force her and it sounds rude, but I keep thinking--- ""I just know that if you took those therapies and medicine seriously you wouldn't be this miserable. I feel like you keep running away from facing your traumas. It's been years and you never actually want to feel better. You keep choosing to be at this dark place in your mind. You know you're not safe nor sane in there, but you keep choosing that place.""   


Maybe that's how really trauma works. But again, she's an adult, she's can function well at work and back then at her school, heck she even does better at me in socializations. I just feel like at this point in time she can help herself, she can choose not to be in that dark place and yet--- she's not... doing it. I know I would never fully understand what she's going through or what she's been through and maybe that's why I can say these things.   


Help is right there, in front of her, and she's not taking it and it's frustrating.   


This post may or may not be a result of pent up years of helplessness.   


Maybe you people here could give me a better or a new insight in her case, because I'm tired and I can't see a way out of here: Why is she so reluctant to take medicine or go to therapy?

130,Anyone try Functional Medicine?,"I (38m) was recommended FM from my therapist to help see if there were biological reasons for my depression that also needed attention besides just talk therapy. Blood work and brain map tests from a surface EEG and just got done going through results. 

Blood work was not too bad from my understanding, need lots of Vitamin D. My blood sugar looks average but because I do very high spikes and then lows which average out (lines up with my college style eating habits and sugar/soda habits). 

Brain map showed that my awake state is near absolute bottom the chart. The explanation was surreal as the doc began to say “everything I see here is what we see often in engineering type brains. I imagine you have a hard time getting going, connecting with people, few friends. But when you get going you tend to have hyper focusing and can really be productive...”. He has known me for maybe 30 minutes total and was describing my entire existence was like and it was completely surreal. 

He recommended about 40 sessions of “brain training” to help get it functioning in ways that are more normal. 

I’ve always had this feeling that I had something severely wrong with my brain my entire life as I would often joke “I bet they find a brain tumor one day.” It was a very emotional thing to finally be shown something that, while not a tumor, could very well be the reason why I am the way I am. 

The doc made a comment “I think we can help you get your life back” and I lost it. I told him “Back? This is all I have ever known. I can’t get back something I never had.” I always have felt like I did not experience the world the same as most everyone else. Talk therapy has been helpful but the main goal has been to reframe how I think about a situation. But this is so much different. This is saying that my brain really does not function the same as most everyone else and needs to physically act differently before I can even start thinking about situations differently. 

I have tried anti-depressants in the past and they did next to nothing noticeable for me. 

I feel vindicated in many ways. I feel terrified that my entire existence, or at least how I experience life, could change (supposedly for the better).

I am a 19 year old female and have been officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder with psychotic features and generalized anxiety disorder. I am currently on 100 mg of Zoloft and I have recently switched birth controls. I was on the generic for Yasmin but, since the 23rd of December, have been on the generic for Yas. I was doing fine on it until I reached toward the end of the pack. I started to become very hostile, apathetic, severe mood swings, severely depressed and anxious, aggravated, argumentive, tearful, overthinking everything, panic attacks, even suicidal at times. I'm going back and forth as to whether this is just really bad pms that is affecting my mental state or if I'm genuinely going into another episode. This is the first time that I have felt this miserable since my last episode a little over a year ago. This has caused me to be very hostile and argumentive toward my boyfriend who I love very much. It is frightening and concerning to me and those around me. I feel like I have no control over my mind and I am desperate for advice and help.

142,What pushed you to try medicine? I've thought about starting twice but have my hesitations.,"Been seeing a therapist for a few months, and it's been going great. But there were at least two instances where I felt so very stuck and unmotivated that I wasn't sure I could self-care/structure my way out of it without meds. 

So I booked appointments with psychiatrists twice, but both times it didn't feel right — either I didn't trust them because of things they did/didn't do or the diagnosis felt off. I'd consider getting a third opinion but psychiatrists are pretty rare in my country + they're very busy these days, and I want to avoid potentially taking time away from others. 

Other things on my mind are: 

- The potential side effects and dealing with them while trying not to let too many things go wrong with my job and relationships and stuff

- Possible allergies to the meds (I have history so it's not completely irrational) and inability to get medical care in case of emergency because of the lockdowns and fullness of hospitals

-  Maybe I don't have it ""bad enough"" to try meds (since I do have stretches of time that are manageable without) and I'd be a fake if I did

- Given what they can do if misused, the thought of having access to meds also scares me in case I get /thoughts/ (for context, I also avoid knives and high buildings)

Thanks to my girlfriend she sometimes gives me some of her adderal to help me clean and stuff, I honestly really like it because I’m able to do one thing without getting bored so easily or getting tired plus i always do clean even tho it’s the last thing I want to do. With my previous psychiatrist in the US he wouldn’t prescribe me anything that i could “abuse” and it made me mad because i knew it worked for me, I also sometimes get anxiety attacks and they get pretty bad so I wanted something that would calm me down quickly so that was also something he said no to.


I’ve taken so many different depression and anxiety medicine but I don’t notice improvement because I always seem to go back to attempting to kill my self. I’m starting to lose hope that I’ll ever be stable and able to lead a “normal” life, part of me wonders if there’s even a point to keep living when my life is so shitty and the medicine I take makes me feel like shit and my suicidal thoughts are still alive and very vivid.

150,A Beginner’s Guide To Psychiatric Medicine," 

When you first start psych meds, you honestly don’t know what you’re doing. I wish that there was a class on how to be a good and helpful patient that anyone could take for free when they get their first script, but instead, I will write out the things I believe are crucial in order to make significant progress aided by meds.

Although I am not a doctor or any sort of health professional, I do consider myself a “professional patient,” due to the past 13 years of dealing with bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. All that time, I have been in treatment with psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, general practitioners, and specialists in various fields. The following is what I’ve learned.

1. One medication does not work the same on everyone. And if you’re already telling other people about your meds (what works for you and what doesn’t), then please read the disclaimer that needs to come before any advice you hand out.
2. Sometimes a med has the effect of causing health problems, making things worse, or affecting you in a way opposite of its intended purpose. An example is that for some people, some antidepressants can cause suicidal ideation, and some antipsychotics can cause hallucinations. These effects happen to a small minority of people, so this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try them. Because… 
3. A med can save your life...[Continue Reading](https://goldfishpainter.com/a-beginners-guide-to-psychiatric-medicine/)

151,Why do medicines for mental health issues have so many sexual side effects?,"This shit bothers me so much. I cant even consider meds for my issue due to massive fears over acquiring something like PSSD. I understand its rare but to me the risk is totally not worth it. And there really dont seem to be a good set of medications for anxiety and depression that don't have this stuff.

My doctor is also not able to find a good medicine for me. I am not willing to take anything that has a risk of sexual sides/PSSD. I know theres Wellbutrin but I also have the tinnitus condition and I've heard of tinnitus sufferers also having that aggravated or even triggered by it so thats also a no go unfortunately. 

Then theres Mirtazapine, which I actually tried recently but it knocked me out and made me totally nonfunctional the next day from a powerful sedative antihistamine effect. It was the lowest dose of 15 mg too and I tried for 3 days and those were 3 days where I literally had trouble getting out of bed (which is not one of my usual symptoms). 


Therapy seriously isn't working and I am getting desperate enough to have to consider medication but no way will I swallow a pill that can cause permanent sexual dysfunction, no matter how rare it is. Even if its my anxiety making me blow that up I don't want to take any risks with my body particularly in a domain that is so integral to a healthy life. My problem was drug induced and I am incredibly sensitive to medicines as well also which makes any of the SSRI interventions in particular a far greater risk.

Whats the hold up for the pharma industry in creating meds for mental health which don't come with such nasty side effects?? The SSRIs are old as hell--why hasn't anybody come up with anything and brought it into the market since? It almost seems like SSRIs are the stone age of psychiatry and we are still in it despite all the research? Based on wikipedia it seems most were made in the 90s which is a really really long time ago.

Should I see my psychiatrist, even though I saw him 2 days ago, or give the new medicine a chance?","I was taking quetiapine er 400 mg, technically known as the happy pill. I told my doctor about my overwhelming lack of being able to give a shit about anything (friends, family, all of those emotions were lost on me), as well as focus and paranoia.

Now I'm taking a little bit if abilify, qutiapine (regular) and some lamotrigine. It's only been 2 days. I'm a firm believer in waiting for a couple of days to see if it has a positive effect. 

So far, I was hit with an overwhelming depression. Overwhelming. Like someone was using my chest like a trampoline. Afterwards, I had hot flashes, I became hyper aware of my breath. It felt as if each breath was a challenge, and I had to physically move my chest, and the pressure of being hyper aware...more or less, my anxiety was going haywire.

As of now, I gave in and tried the quetiapine er again, because I was desperate and felt like a dying man starving for water. 

There was a time with my first psychiatrist, where he gave me a medicine to begin to treat my bipolar. I had a severe anxiety attack for a whole 2 days. It felt like a very creative form of torture, one the devil is fond of. I honest to God thought that I was dying, and I almost wished for it because the pain would never stop. Afterwards, I was exhausted for 3 days, and doing anything would require taking a breath in between.

I experienced something like that this night. Hyper aware of chest. The only difference is I have prior knowledge about how this first felt. I know that it feels like I'm going to die, but I won't. sometimes people get anxious over the idea of having an anxiety attack. I told myself ""c'mon anxiety, hit me. Let's get this over with, hit me"" and that really helps with the anxiety. If you just accept the fact you're going to have an anxiety attack, ironically enough, it'll help.

I used to be extremely lively and hyper from birth to 15, so much so they misdiagnosed me with ADHD (turns out its autism). I had Autism meltdowns sometimes but no other mental health issues present. After a horrifically abusive relationship from 14-16 I developed all my mental health issues, listed in the title. I have seen therapist and psychiatrist from 16 to now at 24 and have been on many different meds and mixtures. 

I have been on Gabapentin (for anxiety), Depakote (mood stabilizer), and Effexor (antidepressant) since I was 18 but was able to stop all of them with no issues in 2018. However, near the end of 2018 I had a boyfriend pass away and I was sent spiraling into the worst mental health issues I've ever had. I got an emergency appointment and got back on all my medicines, and was also prescribed Klonopin as needed for anxiety attacks. 

I've been on the meds again consistently since then (besides Gabapentin, which i stopped taking because i realized it wasn't helping or hurting). 

I've realized recently that I'm so shut down, exhausted, and apathetic to things I used to love. I didn't even realize this could be because of my meds or a lack of a different medicine I might need. I guess that when I was 18 and got prescribed all these meds I figured it was better to be ""dead on the inside"" per say than to feel suicidal/anxious/manic etc. But I don't want to settle for that anymore, I miss being lively and happy and enjoying things.

I've tried all the anti depressants,they make me have suicidal thoughts ,zombified ,etc. Like every worst side effect I get from them all. They do the opposite for me . Just like opiates do absolutely nothing for me for pain. They make me wired.  I was told it seems medicine has a paradoxical effect on me and that it just happens that way in life sometimes. Just like I can drink coffee before bed to relax me lol.  But anyways . Here goes nothing. 

We finally decided on Clonazepam. For anxiety / sleep. It oddly enough does help me sleep if I mentally want to sleep. Like I tell myself it's time to sleep. So wierd. But I try extremely hard to not take these things. I don't want to become addicted. But for example. Tonight. I was dreading work. Like bad. I had what I call a fight anxiety attack. An angry one. Well I took a Clonazepam knowing it was only going to get worse. I feel alive. In a way we're I'm interacting with customers , hey I really like your shirt. Making jokes with them. My mind isn't racing. No panic. No anger. I'm walking around my job singing to the music. Just doing my thing. No mental issues at all. I'm able to focus. Think. And do. And I'm happy. Not drunk or high. Just like a normal functioning human. 

Is there an alternative to this as needed medicine I could ask a Dr about that I take in the morning or something.

171,Fuck the US Healthcare System! America is a terrible country for mental health!,"Early last year, I thought I had decent insurance because I could see a psychiatrist for $25. Then Oscar Health decided to arbitrarily cancel my plan in the middle of the year and automatically enroll me in a ""similar plan"". Similar my ass! - I now had to pay $90 to see the same psychiatrist.  Fuck you Oscar Health! Now my new insurance for this year is refusing to pay for a medicine I'm prescribed because it's not a ""preferred medicine"". My doctor prescribed the ""preferred medicine"" for me to save money, but I ended up having a huge depressive/anxiety episode while on it! I ended up going back on the old medication because I felt so bad on the ""preferred medicine"". Did it ever occur to anyone that the preferred medicine might not work for everyone and there is a reason that these non-preferred medicines are still being manufactured?

I lived abroad for 8 years in Japan and South Korea, but now that I'm back in my home country my mental health has taken a turn for the worse - this is mainly due to the horrible mental healthcare (and healthcare in general situation) in the US.

172,Can medicine used to treat Mental illness have long term side effects,"When I was younger I was given Ritalin because they (pyschatrist) thought I had adhd turns out I didn't and I started having vivid and horrible hallucinations. I was put in a psych ward etc. 

Well fast forward to 2019. I was put on Latuda for my bipolar. Latuda was an absolute nightmare for me. The only way I can describe what I felt while taking Latuda was , restless yet tired and energy less. unable to think clearly (mind going a thousand miles per hour, my thoughts getting mixed up together) thankfully I stopped taking it and was put on Seroquel 2 months after I stopped taking Latuda. (SEROQUEL works amazing for me) But I still feel the effects of Latuda (unable to think clearly /getting my thoughts mixed up) Which never ever ever happened to me before I took Latuda.  My therapist kind of talked about it a little bit and told me it was possible. since psych meds can be known to have long term effects. 

It puts me into a panic attack when I start to think about the long term effects. because I don't want my mind to jumble up thoughts together forever. I want to be able to think clearly like I was able to before Latuda.  I know my therapist already told me this can happen. but I don't see her again till Monday. and idk what to do.

174,Will antidepressant/other mental health medicine change me in ways i don't want?,"i am 19 years old sophomore in college and have suffered from an undiagnosed mental illness for as long as since 5th grade where i remember an incident involving me trying to suffocate myself with my pillow, for the utterly ridiculous reason of my mom not letting me go outside to play with my friends. it was not until about senior year that i realized that maybe something was wrong with me mentally. i have never really talked about this subject with anyone except one counselor at my college a few months ago. i had a meeting in which they got my general story and told me they think i am depressed. 

they wanted me to start one on one therapy when i came back from christmas break, but i never started. one of my biggest fears, more so than just living with my mental issues, is being prescribed medicine that will fix my depression/whatever is wrong with me, but will change who i truly am. i have heard stories in passing of people that get put onto medication and turn to ""zombies"", ""weirdos"", or just described as ""not themselves"". I have no idea how true these stories are, its just word of mouth, but the thought just terrifies me. I for the most part love who i am when i am feeling mentally healthy (not counting my ""bad days"" where i do not like myself) and do not want to change. 

on my good days i am very energetic and playful and happy and very very individualistic. i would hate for any of this to change. however on my bad days i am very quiet, introverted, and do my best to hide away from people, responsibilities, work to do. these are the problems i want fixed.

175,Looking for some advice regarding medicine and insurance.,"First things first, I've never been on this sub before. I'm not sure if this is the appropriate place to post, or if it violates any rules here. I apologize if I'm wrong on either count. 

A quick explanation of the situation. I've never taken mental health medication, so I'm sorry if I sound uneducated, or if there is a simple answer I'm just unaware of. This is about my SO, who aged out of her parents insurance (Kaiser Permanente). She's taking a variety of medicine, not sure which ones specifically. She had an appointment the last week of her coverage and got most of her prescriptions refilled, and has enough to last a while. She wants to keep Kaiser because they have all her info and the transition to a new plan would be simple.  Unfortunately she missed the cutoff date for signing up with Kaiser to have her coverage begin on June 1st, and now apparently will not be covered until July 1st. 

She said all her medications should last until July, except for one. Her Prozac generic, which is obviously very important. Not sure off the top of my head when she'll run out, but sometime in the next week or two. She's freaking out because we don't know where to get more while she's between coverage, and I'm freaking out because I'm the last person to ask about any of these things. 

I guess I really only have one question at the moment. Is there any way to get more of her medicine while she's not covered? Money isn't a huge issue, as we only need a few weeks max until she is covered again.

192,I just want a mind-altering medicine or brain surgery that removes negative emotions,"Content warning: complaining, pessimism, living in a consumerist world, blasphemy (maybe), and implied sui\*\*\*\*

.

.

.

.

.

I'm surprised nobody has come up with some sort of mind-altering medicine or brain surgery that removes the capacity to feel negative emotions (i.e. sadness, anger, maybe even lust). Maybe even something that completely removes all form of emotions from a person, making them simply an empty husk, dead inside. Horrible, yes. But sadly, being an empty husk seems to be a ""requirement"" to survive in this awful world. Ok, not really a requirement, per se. But I think it should make living bearable.

&#x200B;

People are quick to say that people nowadays are so sensitive. If they hate sensitive people so much, then why haven't they invented the thing(s) I've described earlier? Wouldn't that remove the sensitive people they oh so hate so much?

&#x200B;

We basically (and sadly) live in a society where we're simply just trained and conditioned to become another mindless cog in the consumerist, money-making machine (either via school, etc.).

&#x200B;

I want that medicine or surgery because I know I'm not fit for this world. I'm just too emotional. I want to survive the world where almost everyone's a cruel, empathy lacking person. A world where I might just end up getting a job I hate, going to work everyday, day in day out, begging to God to make things better or to just end it all. Yes, I could get a job that's my passion, but sadly not everyone gets it. People also say criticize those kind of jobs as something you won't earn enough money.

&#x200B;

Honestly, I don't think I have that many choices. To be fair, I'd be skeptic if it disables positive emotions as well. I only want something that stops negative emotions. If negative emotions is what makes me human, then so be it. I will throughout and thoroughly reject my humanity. I'm just having a hard time living in this world. If such medicine or surgery exists, I might wait till I'm 25 or so before taking it. Even then, it's very tempting to do so.

&#x200B;

To be honest, I think the invention of such medicine or surgery would be beneficial to me. There are reasons why I haven't done this, but I think I would have ended it all earlier, or sooner or later. But I just can't. I'm not brave enough for ""that."" One of the reasons is because I believe in Pascal's wager. If I'm numb to negative emotions, I could at least live without the constant feeling of wanting to end it all.",1557127691.0,False,1,2,Mat2468xk,None,bl8zjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/bl8zjb/i_just_want_a_mindaltering_medicine_or_brain/
193,I developed Peyroine’s Disease from a Penile Injury and then missed 2 back-to-back Doctor Appointments and allowed scar tissue to form in the weeks it took to get another appointment for prevention medicine. I am really upset at myself for this and can’t stop thinking about it.,"I missed a doctor appointment, I hit snooze on my alarm for 10 minutes, and that’s how late I was as to miss my appointment. I don’t really know why I did this, I was already crushed about this. I was just very tired and barely slept before, but I knew that 10 minutes would make no difference. Also my doc made me wait an hour my last two appointments to see him so I thought eh what’s the harm. I should’ve really just prioritized my health and done all I could to get there. Then when I called to say I was late they said we have to cancel but can reschedule tomorrow. I thought okay surely one day won’t make a real difference. Then I slept through the appointment or my alarm didn’t go off. I thought I had had the silver lining there. Then I heard about Hims and tried that and they told me no, and I could’ve messaged my doc online for the cialis, but didn’t. I was afraid maybe he’d say no online and I’d mess it up for myself or that they were mad I missed two appointments (both of those anxious worries were likely very wrong). Also Hims had me a bit concerned that maybe I should talk to my doc first about if there’s risks or anything (a dumb worry, but the doc at Hims did kinda put that in my head - and again I could’ve messaged him online but got too anxious at the thought of messing up or them being mad at me. So dumb. And I had already felt like it was too late which is ironic because it just ended up being even later by not messaging) And I ended up not doing anything, partially because I thought I was starting to stabilize for maybe 5 days or so. This was also around thanksgiving so I had that and family stuff on my mind and my need to fix my sleep…it felt a bit chaotic, I was sleeping nocturnally I think at the time, but I really should’ve just messaged my doc in hindsight 100%, I just feared ruining my chances I guess. Which in hindsight is dumb because then I could’ve just used another online service, but I did not think this through. Then about 5 days before my appointment which was 2 weeks after the missed one, I start curving and noticed flaccid curving. I assume the scar tissue has grown more in that time. On average cialis prevents 14% worsening, that’s a 14% average I really wish I had now and am really trying to reverse. Cialis has worked like a miracle drug for me so far, I’ve been on it 11 days and everything is essentially back to normal except I still have flaccid curving, my injured side is much weaker (I imagine from scar tissue and reduced bloodflow) and I still have pain, though it is often less. While I want to be happy things have gotten better, and just be happy about life in general, I am just so upset with myself for not prioritizing my health, I feel that it’s very likely I could’ve prevented the scar tissue from forming at a considerable level and just didn’t because I fucked up and now I have to fight to hope that I can possibly undo it to a level of what could’ve been prevented or more or less, and it’s just all so uncertain. I wonder if it hurts more now because there’s more plaque. The flaccid curve really annoys me, and it definitely curves more while erect than it did at the time but I think it’s essentially what my curve was a year ago, or even recently (hard to say for certain) so it’s not a huge deal. I think i may have lost length/girth also but it seems the length is back or nearly back to what it was. I just hate that I allowed scar tissue to form more where I could’ve prevented it, 14% is just the average and given as well as cialis has worked for me as I haven’t gotten worse at all since being on it I may have been able to stop all of this from happening entirely! So again, though I am grateful I’ve gotten better it’s just hard not to be upset with myself because how easy it would’ve been to have just gotten this shit sooner, and I care about my health and was so scared about this, there’s really just no reason that I didn’t. I feel dumb, I’ve been talking about it with a therapist on betterhelp but it hasn’t really been much help. Every time my dick hurts it serves as like a constant reminder as to how I fucked up. My negligence allowed my health to worsen. It’s easy to tell me it’s not a big deal or don’t worry about it, but I HATE that I was negligent about my own health, I really did not mean to be. I really just fucked up. I don’t want to have this effect me the rest of my life, in any capacity, because I was negligent for 2 weeks. That’s really all it took. I’ve been thinking about this almost nonstop I’ve been having a really hard time with it. I just wish I could go back and drag my stupid ass outta bed the first time and get on cialis the 2 weeks sooner and see how much better I’d be now, if at all, or a ton, or completely. I hate that I may have to forever live with this mistake. I pray I won’t, but the outcomes of this disease are so uncertain and improvement is highly uncertain, I hate it. Seems like no one can help me and I’m supposed to just “let go”, and I guess I am, it’s just such a consequential mistake the effects of which I deal with near constantly now.",1702649626.0,False,0,0,Illustrious-Head3803,None,18j10q3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/18j10q3/i_developed_peyroines_disease_from_a_penile/

195,A friend of mine (who's studying medicine) questioned me about my medication today and I didn't know what to say,"So they asked why I'm taking Abilify. I told them it was a mood stabilizer and they went, ""I don't think you need that, I don't think you have bipolar"". Except I go all hyper on antidepressants, even when I'm on a mood stabilizer. My doctor never told me I'm bipolar to be honest, though they mentioned cyclothymia once, not as a diagnosis but as a way of describing my behavior. Their words were: ""I think your behavior sounds much more cyclothymic now than before"". I think they suspect it alongside my aspergers. I don't think I have Aspergers to be honest though. Not that I think I have something else, I just don't think I have Aspergers. I've already asked my psychiatrist about my diagnosis, but they've been dismissive saying ""you need the mood stabilizer's for aspergers"".

I'm having a lot of brain fog and weight gain issues lately and can't really focus on anything right now. It's all too confusing and I want to quit meds. But then I remember I tend to get psychotic (self-referential). Is quitting my meds the right thing to do? (Meds because I also take Topamax and Trintellix, alongside Abilify). Or is my friend wrong there? They weren't close to me when my mood started to become all over the place. Our contact happens basically via text, when it does.

Anyway, I don't remember how I used to be anymore before meds, because I'm taking meds for three years already. So I don't know if the meds are helping (I do feel like a zombie though). And this, the lack of a diagnosis that makes sense and being questioned makes me think I should not be taking meds. 

Wait... I now remember I had an experience that like like erotomania before (though no one really believes me when I say that, they are really dismissive), and I had some mental breakdowns. But none of them are ""extreme enough"" for close friends to believe me. I think no one will really believe me until I do something stupid.",1576439451.0,False,6,7,pgsab,None,eb3n9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/eb3n9u/a_friend_of_mine_whos_studying_medicine/

I realize this is a pretty controversial subject, and I’ve been on both sides of this thinking at different times in my life, always ruthlessly defending whatever side I was on.

Now I’m trying to approach this as open mindedly and also with as much healthy skepticism as possible... I want to cut through the bs and woo-woo stuff and get to the real science and results that must be out there. 

I feel like everyone has such strong opinions on both sides and very convincing data on both sides. It’s hard to figure out what to trust and what not to trust.

197,I developed Peyroine’s Disease from a Penile Injury and then missed 2 back-to-back Doctor Appointments and allowed scar tissue to form in the weeks it took to get another appointment for prevention medicine. I am really upset at myself for this and can’t stop thinking about it.,"I missed a doctor appointment, I hit snooze on my alarm for 10 minutes, and that’s how late I was as to miss my appointment. I don’t really know why I did this, I was already crushed about this. I was just very tired and barely slept before, but I knew that 10 minutes would make no difference. Also my doc made me wait an hour my last two appointments to see him so I thought eh what’s the harm. I should’ve really just prioritized my health and done all I could to get there. Then when I called to say I was late they said we have to cancel but can reschedule tomorrow. I thought okay surely one day won’t make a real difference. Then I slept through the appointment or my alarm didn’t go off. I thought I had had the silver lining there. Then I heard about Hims and tried that and they told me no, and I could’ve messaged my doc online for the cialis, but didn’t. I was afraid maybe he’d say no online and I’d mess it up for myself or that they were mad I missed two appointments (both of those anxious worries were likely very wrong). Also Hims had me a bit concerned that maybe I should talk to my doc first about if there’s risks or anything (a dumb worry, but the doc at Hims did kinda put that in my head - and again I could’ve messaged him online but got too anxious at the thought of messing up or them being mad at me. So dumb. And I had already felt like it was too late which is ironic because it just ended up being even later by not messaging) And I ended up not doing anything, partially because I thought I was starting to stabilize for maybe 5 days or so. This was also around thanksgiving so I had that and family stuff on my mind and my need to fix my sleep…it felt a bit chaotic, I was sleeping nocturnally I think at the time, but I really should’ve just messaged my doc in hindsight 100%, I just feared ruining my chances I guess. Which in hindsight is dumb because then I could’ve just used another online service, but I did not think this through.

199,Primary doctor refusing to change my medicine (Paxil) unless I see a psychiatrist. What should I do?,"I have been struggling with depression and anxiety pretty much my entire life, I never wanted to take meds because of the horror stories i read and hear about on the internet from those who use them. Mainly withdrawal effects, side effects and worst of all is that sometimes they make you even worse.

I have mentioned my memory problems to my primary doctor last year, from there i talked about my mental health and she suggested that i take paxil, which i was strongly against at first, after pressuring me to take it, i agreed. I took it for about 4 months at first, it helped a little with anxiety but it made me feel like a zombie with no emotions, so i stopped taking it (Gradually), 2 months later my anxiety came back full blast and i had to take it again. I have been on it for 5 months now and i feel so bad right now. I haven't been interacting socially with anyone and i am so lazy and not happy at all.

I talked to my doctor again and told her that i want to change the medicine, she asked me how i feel about seeing a psychiatrist and i told her it is not something i am considering right now, plus i cannot afford it. she ignored me and still made a referral for a psychiatrist for me and told me to call them to make sure they accept my insurance. she even only gave me one month of refill on paxil.  

I don't wanna see a psychiatrist, mainly because i have a huge problem trusting someone with my mental health, I see psychiatrist as money hungry people who just want me to keep coming back to make more money. Now i am sure there are many genuine psychiatrists out there but i am simply not in a stage in my life right now to see one. 

What kind i do to change my medicine? should i see another doctor? or should i talk to the same doctor again? I would appreciate any advice.

213,"Struggling to cope with how much of my life was destroyed by my ""depression""","Firstly, a bit of backstory: 

I originally sought professional help because I'm transgender, but was denied treatment because I am depressed. I am depressed because I am transgender and getting absolutely no help.

My doctor diagnosed me with depression and started medicine for it. For the past two years I have taken said medicine. In those two years absolutely no progress for improvement with literally anything was made. Because nothing was working I was really suicidal every single day.

A few months back I just gave up. I decided to stop taking my medicine, figuring it'd make my mental health collapse and I'd actually just end it.

Now to present day:

My mental health got better. Turns out it was a misdiagnose by several doctors, and the ssri medications were causing serotonin syndrome in me, which resembled the symptoms of depression.

I am no longer suicidal, my social anxiety is gone, literally all my mental problems besides trauma and being trans are gone. I am genuinely mentally in the best state in the past 2 years.

But my life is completely destroyed. I had to drop out of high school because of my ""depression"", and high school is mandatory here. I lost all of my friends. I got alienated from most of my family.

I had really good grades before the anxiety caused by the medicine set in. I could have literally become a surgeon. Now I'll be lucky if my resume is good enough for me to flip burgers at McDonald's. I also have no money and I'm temporarily homeless.

My social skills deteriorated to basically nonexistant during those two years, I have like 3-6 friends/people I know. My body is covered in scars from self harm and I feel really ugly because of it. And most of my ambitions in life have been crushed.

I am really struggling to cope with this. Even though almost all my problems are solved, I feel like I have nothing left, like the damage is already done.

215,wondering if i should get on medicine for OCD / ADD,"Hi! Warning: long post, but I would really love some feedback. 

So I don't know how I happened upon googling OCD a month ago, but I did. As I've been doing research, I've found a lot of things that really resonate with me. I'm someone that believes when I feel a certain way I'm just being dramatic, so I'm not sure if the things I feel are OCD. 

Since I was younger, I've felt the strong urge to touch things, look at things, etc. a certain amount of times until it ""feels right"" or someone in my family will die. I know this is absurd but I just have to do it and have felt that way since I was young. I feel extreme anxiety when I force myself not to tap. 
I've also noticed recently that I lock my car about ten times when I get out and sometimes I still don't trust that I've hit the right button so I have to do it again. 

I also realized while doing research that there are many times where I feel compelled to do certain things, like stab someone or jump off a building if I'm really high, wreck my car when I'm driving. I know in my mind I would never do these things but I still get the thought over and over and have to force it out of my head and it fills me with anxiety. This doesn't happen every single day though. 

As I've gotten older, I feel that I don't do these things as much, also because like I said I have tried to force myself to stop doing these things, such as tapping. I do, however, notice that these things flare up when I'm under a lot of stress. And I can go times where it barely bothers me at all. 

There are also things that I do that I'm not sure if they are symptoms of OCD: 

I tend to overanalyze and doubt everything. 

EX: The other day, I had a meeting all day instead of going to work. I knew I had an important meeting after work at 3:00 and my all day meeting ended at 3. I told my boss I would be a little late. When I got there in the morning, someone told me that it ends at 330, which is pretty typical of me to never know what is going on. I always get dates confused and am constantly forgetting things. I feel like my mind is so scattered. So I was very anxious about being late to the meeting at 3 so I texted my boss. She didn't text me back and I was filled with anxiety ALL DAY. I was wondering what I needed to do, if I should leave early, if my boss thought it was unprofessional that I texted her. It literally ruined my day because I was constantly checking my phone and thinking about it. Then I got out of my meeting early and was able to make it on time. I was so nervous about going into the meeting on time wondering what my boss was going to say about me texting I would be late and then showing up on time. 

I do things like this all the time. I will say something in conversation and worry about it all day if I offended someone. I'll worry about things I didn't say. I am always worrying and I am wondering if this is what affects my sleep at night. I just can't turn my mind off. 
I doubt myself, my decisions, my relationships, I doubt how people truly feel about me. 


So on top of this, I was telling a coworker a story of my life and how its always in shambles and she mentioned maybe I should get on medicine for ADD. I'd never even considered it and don't know enough about it to know if I have it. 

I started thinking and realize when I'm cleaning, I do tend to focus on one area and I'll make a huge mess organizing, then I'll take something to put it up, get distracted and start cleaning something else while I still have a huge mess I've made trying to organize something else. 

I'm very unorganized in my head and in my life. My car and apartment is a mess. I put off very simple tasks, such as writing down bill info so every time I pay I have to do a lost password for everything. I never save names in my phone if its a new number. Not sure if this is lazy or if it is ADD??? 

These are not all the symptoms I have from doing research but from what I've written, what are your thoughts?? Do I have OCD or ADD? Should I get on medicine? 

I normally would just deal with it but lately with all the stress I am under and dealing with loneliness and depression, the thoughts in my head that I've described have been pretty overwhelming to the point where I kind of just want to stay in bed all day.

The problem is I truly have no idea what I am and the medicine I was being given for those diagnosis didn't help me at all. I feel like my symptoms are all over the place which would make schizoaffective disorder with bipolar seem correct on paper, but I can't function on any antipsychotic medicine. When on them all I can do is sleep and can't do any task that would make me a functional person (I can barely talk or understand what people are telling me). I'm more functional without antipsychotic medicine. Everytime a doctor sees that diagnosis in my file out comes the push to take them and they think I'm being defiant about not taking them. 

The only medicine that makes me feel better are antidepressants and the ADD medicine. I know lying is bad, but I truly felt like I wasn't bipolar schizoaffective and when I was on ADD medicine for a year I finally felt like I could live up to people standards. I'm not talking about me feeling wired and multitasking like crazy. Just being able to focus and get done what seems to me as the basics. Like taking care of yourself, your house, pets, and not always failing expectations at work. Of course I would still struggle from time to time with ADD meds but it made life seems less overwhelming and hopeless.

I finally got an appointment with a psychiatrist for next month and I'm so nervous. I'm a complicated case due to all my past diagnosis and the fact that I feel like the diagnosis I had as a teen are off. As a teen I did experience some delusional thoughts and hallucinations, but that was after what felt like week long non stop panic attack were I couldn't go to sleep due to fear. This to most doctors just sounds like a manic episode, but I feel like it might of been something else. What? I'm not sure. Cptsd, lack of resources to feel secure, feeling so hopless I finally I had a nervous breakdown?

What can I say to this psychiatrist? Should I just tell them what I wrote here? Is there anyway I can get them to start fresh with my history of diagnosis and try to figure out what I really am and what will help me function the best now?",1709217476.0,False,1,0,Euphoric-Frame6032,None,1b31ti6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1b31ti6/what_type_of_helped_do_i_need/
