0,How many years has mental illness stolen from you?,"I’ve been severely depressed since puberty up until present (27f) and for all those years, about 15 now, I’ve missed out on major development as a person, countless memories, and I fear I’ve missed out on life itself.

I know it’s silly to feel so alone because there are people out there that share my experience. But it doesn’t stop me from feeling alone regardless.

21,I need help quitting weed for my mental health ,"Hi, 

I’m a 23 year old female and I’ve been smoking weed since 17. It didn’t become a problem until the age of 18 where if I couldn’t get any, I would go absolutely mad until I did. 

I struggle with extreme depression and have recently tried to unalive myself. After this incident I have finally realised what a shit show my life is and want to turn it around. 

I am on route to fixing my mental health and addiction but am struggling to start my journey. I have so many people in my circle that smoke and it’s hard for me to say no when offered.

I don’t have the money to spend but I always find myself spending money on weed rather than essential things like food and bills. When being in debt already it’s the worst feeling in the world. 

My parents and partner cannot stand the fact I smoke and to be honest I can’t stand it either. It’s not who I am. 

I’ve been trying to cut down but it’s just not working and I’ve tried cold turkey in the past but always go back. I’ve come to a conclusion that it impacts my mental health negatively and does me no favours. 

I have also gained a lot of weight from binge eating after smoking and I feel disgusting. 

I would love some help as I’m ready to get my life back after so many years of devoting it to something that doesn’t even help me like I thought it did for so long.

I remembered once a group of ladies were sitting with some of the staff and chatting about stuff, and another patient was crying hard and obviously having a problem. The staff just pretended to not see what was happening and kept chatting with the old ladies.

Any kind of therapy was aimed at the lowest common denominator, and that's understand but also useless. It was maybe playing word games or reading the safety rules. Nothing helpful.

28,Perception on mental illness (as a non-mentally illed person),"I don’t know if it is just where I live or is it a common problem. But I feel like mental illness is so “romanticised” and it is extremely harmful. 

Idk if romanticise is the right word since I am not talking about where mental illness is a trendy thing or whatever. I am talking about how it is always portrayed as something kind of special thing. 

It is portrayed as where a person has mental illness is just misunderstood and lonely, and by just “being there“ you can save them. Of course it is a nice thing to persuade the public to be more attentive to mentally illed people. But the reality is mental health isn’t something that light, it is as big of a problem as physical health and even more complicated than that since we don’t really know its mechanism.

The whole story of how you can save someone with mental illness is just putting unnecessary stress on the person’s support system. I used to feel so compelled to just say something comforting to a mentally illed person vent to me to “save them” or at least so ever so slightly prolong their life and constantly worrying about not saying the right thing or being silent would push them towards demise. I have become so much more a listener when I finally free myself from the burden. I ain’t a hero, I am merely a human who try their best to make their sick friend feel slightly better. And there’s barely anything I can do to take away their illness so no need to worry about whether or not I can really help. I don’t have to give the most correct answer, and it’s ok if I can’t do anything. Even if they lash out on me, I can tell myself it’s just their mental illness talking. And it is ok to distant myself from them or just take a break if their accusations ever is too much to bear. They may say no one care enough to “be there” and that’s part of mental illness, not everything they say is truth, their self-hatred aren’t true and so can their hatred to you. And all in all, it just help me set boundaries and allow me to be in a better space to help. 

If I can tell myself back then, I would tell her that mental illness complex problem that is haunting all of humanity in the current world and it is not gonna be magically healed by just one person “being there” and it can’t be solely caused just by you not being there that one time, or not having given some specific advice in that particular conversation. If the person is unfortunately killed by mental illness, it is a sorrow , but it is also not your fault. 

Mental illness shouldn’t be shone a special light. It is just as serious and important as physical illness but also as much of a disease as physical illness which no one has the magic cure. IMO this perception is a much better one to look at mental illness for the public, both in terms of destigmatizing mental illness and ensuring wellbeing of the close one around them. 

Just some thoughts. And I am sorry if any of the wordings I used may make this article offensive, English isn’t my first language, I have full respect for mentally illed people and wish all of you the best. 

And to all the supportive people out there, even if they may not be able to thank you, I would like to thank you all. It is beyond hard going against one of humanity greatest enemy, and I know you are trying your absolute best already and that means a lot, no matter what they say. And I am glad the world has you.

32,Mental Health or Mental World?,"Hi all I've had something I've been wondering for a while and it's a couple weeks away til I talk to my therapist, so I'd just like some input.

I've struggled with social anxiety and general anxiety my whole life, but I wasn't even aware I was stressing out or having anxiety every waking minute until I asked for help. I get stuck in mental loops where I can't think of anything else, and suicide is a frequent contender for this spot. When I think about work I can't logically see any reason for anyone to want to work anymore. Corporations are dog shit, and every ounce of meaningfulness has been ripped from work.

Everything is monetized and because of this so is my logic. I can't work at a job that pays less than $55/hr because that's what I'm worth. People generally think I'm pompous or I've assumed something, but that's literally what minimum wage should be. I can't get over this in my head, and so I've been out of work for over a year. I can't take care of myself anymore because I've monetized even chores in my head that it's simply cheaper to pay someone else to do my chores for me.

And therein lies the problem. Does no one else see how stupid this system is? Why are people just okay with it? I can't bring myself to work or take care of myself, so I get government cheese, and then those around me are more hateful/instigating of my behavior. But why? CEOs wouldn't even spit on them if they were on fire.

Am I crazy? Why is everyone so okay with how everything is? It drives me insane. I get stuck in loops about XYZ being bad and people can just do it and not care. How do you not care? I can't even do something without thinking 1000s ways to approach the situation, but people are really just out here fumbling their way into nonstop success?

I'm worried therapists just thinking I'm exaggerated or lying about the self harm, my drinking habits, the dissociation and irregular emotions. When I told them about these things, they sometimes would use quotation marks in the written report, as if they didn't believe me.

On multiple occassions I've been told ""We are sorry you're going through this, but we don't know what we can do to help"". It feels like they don't want to take me seriously, they don't care to listen, they don't want to help me because I'm either too much hassle to deal with or a liar.

It's got into my head. Maybe I *am* a liar and I just don't know it. Maybe all those things I did that I thought were bad were actually normal and not worth worrying about, maybe I'm not sick and just want attention. Maybe all the self harming, drinking, etc was just a performance for myself, even when I knew no one could see me in that state

40,Please Stop Recommending Pets as a Mental Health Fix,"I’ve seen this several times under a lot of posts on this Reddit, and I’m not saying pets don’t help. I don’t want to discount the experiences of people who says pets have helped with their mental illnesses, and I don’t want to discredit scientific studies that suggest having a pet elevates your mood.  However, a pet is a living creature that requires a lot of care, and if you are so depressed it is hard to keep up with your responsibilities, a pet might add to your stress rather than helping relieving it. This really reminds me of those couples who fight and fight and they think having a baby will fix their relationship. 

Please remember that pets aren’t props used to help humans, they are living creatures with their own feelings and needs. I don’t want to discourage you from getting a pet, but please only get one if you can take care of it, not just to help with your mental health.

Morning of the appointment I got a call from someone at the clinic telling me that my provider is ill and needs to cancel but they'll call back to reschedule. Never a call back and I'm again disappointed and frustrated and give up for a while.

Last week I again found a provider for a telehealth session ... and ITS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. I'm finally starting to set the table for this therapy session I need so much, when they realize they aren't licensed in my state and have to stop the session..... I'm so frustrated.

54,Spouse mental status ,"Hello 
I’m seeking some advice regarding my wife’s mental status. 

For the several years I’ve noticed a growing change in my wife’s behavior. She has always showed a mild animosity towards other females, and some extreme jealousy, but I was usually able to talk her down from these feelings. For a long time this wasn’t much of an issue for me. But it slowly began to intensify, along with her mood. She began coming downstairs in the morning in a terrible mood. I would greet her and offer her some breakfast and she would say “I don’t know. Leave me alone”. She would occasionally say things like “I wish I wasn’t alive”. “What’s the point of life?”. 

She began to target her anger towards my female friends and family members. When I first noticed this I suggested that she seek counseling, but she accused me of calling her crazy. As time went on, this behavior continued to get worse. I began suggesting that we go to marriage counseling, just as a way to get her to talk to someone about this. This suggestion was ignored over and over again. 

Cut to today; we are ostracized from her friends, my friends, my family. And she refuses to hold a conversation with me, usually just giving me one word answers. It seems like she has anger towards every person in our lives. 

I have noticed that things tend to get worse when certain things happen in her life. She has been terminated from several jobs, experienced financial troubles, and the passing of family members has all seemed to make things worse. Now it just seems like she is in a constant state of anger. And she blames me and everyone else for it. 

Additional information: she comes from a very fractured family, while I come from a very close knit family. 

There is a lot that I left out just to keep this from being a novel. But I am just looking for some suggestions on how we can move on from this. We have a young daughter and I don’t want her to be influenced by any of this.

I have experiences when I try so hard to remain sane around people but every time my mind will go insane, I would feel like I’m hearing people talk about me ( in a negative way) ; keep in mind they aren’t even talking to me and it’s like I can’t even trust myself because I don’t know what’s happening 

One example, let’s say I work with a coworker who I thought was really cool with me, I’m always excited and happy to see them, but last night all my intrusive thoughts were about hate towards me from her

As if something telling me, this friendship won’t last. Imagine someone in your ear mumbling, constantly that they hate you. 

I felt so much anxiety around that coworker and others but around most people my mind is cool and collective. 

Does anyone go through the same experience? 
Because I always fight it with positivity but i just don’t trust people after that.

I believe I may have bipolar or borderline personality disorder. I’ve done a lot of research and discussed this with people who have these disorders but I will be seeing a psychiatrist in a couple of weeks to get professional help and official diagnosis. Mental illness is prevalent in my family two of my sisters are bipolar and my grandmother suspected bipolar but committed suicide at 35 years old and was never diagnosed. I have pretty severe anxiety and OCD (I am not diagnosed OCD but have the intrusive thoughts, ritualistic behavior, repetitive actions until it feels right, etc) I got a primary care doctor and she put me on Buspirone until I see a psychiatrist. She offered a mood stabilizer but said it can make things worse if not monitored correctly or if I didn’t actually need it. But she said she suspects I have a mood or personality disorder. I had flu and pneumonia (first time I’ve been sick in almost 10 years) in March of this year. I was given steroids by my primary care and was warned to stop immediately if I experience any abnormal behavior. I believe it put me into either mania or hypomania and I discontinued it right away. I then started to experience what I learned now is derealization. My reality feels altered like I’m high or drunk but I can still function. I’ve experienced this feeling before but only for an hour or so maximum and this has lasted for months now. It seems to lighten up sometimes but I still feel altered. The last two weeks my anxiety has heightened and I feel as if something bad is going to happen and I can’t shake the feeling. I wake up throughout the night and as soon as I am aware I’m awake I get that dreaded feeling again and it’s eating me alive. Throughout the day I try my best to function but I feel like my body is constantly in flight or fight mode and my mind won’t stop racing. I keep getting that falling from heights pit feeling in my stomach and that it’s the end of the world. I constantly fear I’m going to be fired at work due to the stressful environment and boss. Every task feels impossible and I have no motivation. Buspirone has seemed to calm me down but I am wondering if it’s why I can’t feel normal. I take 10 mg 3 times a day. I have people who care about me but I feel like they don’t actually understand and it makes me feel alone. This is probably all related to my mental health and I am so grateful to be seeing a psychiatrist in a couple weeks but I just hate feeling like this and am so lost right now. I thought maybe someone out there would know this feeling or have any advice. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

I feel stuck and most days I only try escaping the pain and don't see myself as more than an addict. Don't really want to live anymore, but still afraid of killing myself or dying.

I always get hope that this time it's going to work out, but I always fool myself. It feels like its never going to be okay.

115,Mentally Drained,"I moved my mom into our household to help with childcare and help give her a healthy environment where she can be near people for her mental health and general well being. My mom has a poor grasp on mental health and has always struggled with anxiety and depression, accepting that it’s just part of normal life.

Not without difficulty along the way she’s made huge bounds in managing her anxiety, but still has days where she struggles with particularly anxiety which also feeds into another layer of depression. The past couple weeks she’s been having a hard time, typical cycles of not wanting to do anything and socialize. Been trying to help her manage it, somewhat unsuccessfully this week, which is fine. Some days are better than others.

Today I’ve been trying to help her work through the idea of staying inside and sleeping and inviting her to do errands outside of the house and I’d either get no response or just be told not to talk. I’ve heard it all before and can handle it. But it tears me to shreds. I’m conscious of how I’m affected and am very resilient, though I’ve struggled on the past as well.

I just feel like every time I soldier through negative interactions that I’m just losing a bit of myself. It’s exhausting. I’m tired. It’s been a year and a half of this. Trying to get my mom professional help too, I’m not qualified for this.

116,Is it pathetic that I still have mental breakdowns at age 25?,"I’ve always had mental breakdowns, I figured maybe I’ll grow out of them one day but it doesn’t seem to be the case. 

I feel pathetic because my parents witness me having them. Which mainly is me just crying uncontrollably and trying to stay away from others/hide it, but I’m not good at hiding crying. 

I want to hide it because everyone always asks “can I do anything to help” which the last thing I want when this is happening is any sort of attention. I cannot think rationally when I’m in this state, so verbalizing my needs doesn’t work, I just shut everybody out because I’m not thinking straight. 

And yes I’ve been in therapy most of my life, but haven’t needed it in a year or so. I don’t think therapy will help in this situation as I’ve tried it before and didn’t help long term and hardly short term. 

I know what I need and it’s to cry it out, crying is my bodies way of releasing stress (and humans in general but most don’t let themselves cry which sounds awful). But regardless it makes me feel down in the dumps as I’m crying, but after I often feel relief. I guess I just have to live with it.

I’ve been told by my brother growing up that my crying is “pathetic” so I think I internalized that opinion of his and now believe everyone views crying as pathetic. I just hate to be a bother to others.

My life hasn't been smooth since childhood. I was the elder son in the family, always heard from my mom that I'm the reason for all the problems. I blamed myself for many things and somehow concluded that it's all because we don't have as much money as other people...

I chose to prepare for JEE in 11th grade just because my father and mother wanted me to be an engineer, and I thought engineering is all about big machinery, construction work, and cool electric gadgets or aircrafts... (IITs & NITs have good placement stats in these kinds of engineering branches as well, but as I told you, I've failed the exam twice. Now I'm going to some cheap private engineering college, where there is nothing more than professors teaching theory if I opt for engineering in any of these fields, with placement in a mass-recruiter company (companies like TCS hiring people for Rs.20,000/month 😪 I don't want to be that guy, I will choose to die that's much better for me). Now, they are putting me into the rat race of coding just because the average pay for software engineers is higher. I never dreamed of becoming a guy sitting on a chair looking at a laptop screen all day long... My brain freezes each time I try to remember the days I decided to try JEE...

Is there any way I can get out of this regret?",1715051954.0,False,1,0,SoilPristine1340,None,1cm24ce,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cm24ce/jee_got_me_depression_and_other_mental_health/

148,I'm a mental hypochondriac,"I don't think I'm alone, but I'm a mental hypochondriac. My wife made me see therapists whenever she thought there was something wrong with me. I did have a very traumatic childhood. I felt like I have OCD, narcissism, thought I was a sociopath or even full on Dexter Morgan because I just feel like I'm just faking it, forcing myself to do small talk and trying to act normal. Sometimes, I even thought of myself as that priest in The Carnivale, an old show on HBO, who was inherently evil but trying to be good. 

I am obsessive. I'm competitive. Sometimes a perfectionist. But my psychiatrist thinks I just watch too much tv and overthink things. He hasn't diagnosed me with anything, not to say that I don't have a lot of work to do due to my childhood traumas. I do, have a lot of work left to do. I have been working hard to improve myself. I feel like a completely different person from just 10 years ago. I'm more patient, less confrontational. I'm understanding, sympathetic, still working hard to be more empathic, and I take time to think through things before responding or taking action - so less erratic. Most importantly, I'm more confident. I've always seemed confident on the outside, but I was an insecure little kid behind the impenetrable shell. I'm still insecure, just less so. I still have a shield, but it's a little more permeable. I'm **more** of these good traits, and that's a win for me - just being a better person, teaching myself life skills that probably should have been taught by my parents.

I guess my point is that once you find the right psychiatrist, one that you can connect with, one that you can open up to, you will start to heal. It's like building your muscles. It won't happen overnight, but healing will begin. And don't resist medication. I resisted for 20-30 years, and then finally started taking low doses of lexipro, and it really changed my life.

Hi (22M). for some background, I'm studying medicine in India. for the past couple of months, I've been having these episodes where nothing excites me at all for 3-4 days, then gradually everything becomes fine again. Every little thing that feels off triggers extremely bad anxiety. I try to look as cheerful as i possibly can to mask those feelings but that emptiness lingers in me. To make things even weirder, that anxiety goes away whenever the thought of being de\ad glances my mind. 
I don't really feel like communicating this with anyone and I haven't told anyone about this. It has affected my daily life and those episodes of uneasiness are becoming more frequent. I used to absolutely love playing games and spending time with my close ones, but now, I don't really feel like doing anything. I feel more dizzy and sleep feels like an escape from this, but to make matters worse, I've started having nightmares and abrupt sleeps.

I was very involved at a young age and think it would help me recover and reconnect with that time. I am just worried because most of my visual hallucinations are paranoia about demons/ evil entities. I wanna give it a shot but am also worried it will encourage/in-force these “thoughts”. I think this because my mom is now a practicing “witch” (not specific to a certain type) and anytime she brings up spirits it makes me paranoid and makes me hallucinate more. Paranoia is a big factor in my schizophrenia. I want to mainly read many bibles and religious texts, so i can figure out if there is a religion i connect to and maybe a church/groups so i feel support.

Any suggestions on religions, texts, and/or tips on what to do or not do? Also any opinions are welcome?🙏

159,I'm mentally weak,"A few months ago, through my constant state of being upset, I figured out I most Likley had depression. 

Now, I don't think I've fully got over my depression, but I'm feeling much happier much more regularly. I'm able to complete more every day tasks, and able to get out more. But I feel I'm either still depressed or have become very mentally weak. 

This is because when something happens that would usually upset somone, but leave them able to just feel a bit upset for a while and then be fine again, or leave them upset throughout the day but able to hide it and be fine again the next day, it just sends me back into a state of absolute depression. 

This could even be the most minor thing, something that other people wouldn't even care about, and it would really upset me and send me into a depressive state. 

I also often fall into a depressive state randomly for no apparent reason quite regularly.

165,Mental health vs. career,"Hi all, first time poster here. I’ve been finding myself in a vicious cycle and I’m not sure how to start addressing it, as in I’m not sure if my mental health is affecting my job or if my job is affecting my mental health.

To get into details, I’ve struggled with mental health for most of my adult life, but it seems to be hitting a peak at the moment. I do see a therapist on an as-needed basis, but have never really dealt with medication. I also believe I may be neurodivergent, but haven’t attempted to receive a formal diagnosis.

As far as my job, I’ve been an interior designer at a corporate architecture firm for about 1.5 years now. This is also my first office job after years of mainly customer service, and the learning curve has been STEEP. I just had my annual review and it was not great. Many things I recognize as room to improve but a lot of it came out of left field in my opinion, and really sent me spiraling. This is not the first time this job has sent me into panic attacks and depression spirals.

I’m just lost on how to stop the cycle. Is it my job? Will starting over in a new position help, or be more stress inducing having to start over? Should I address mental health first? Maybe if I do that I’ll have more confidence and focus for my performance? But I’m also worried about trying medications since the effects can be unpredictable.

I just want to be content with my job and not have it drain me, and enjoy my free time without dreading work.

166,Mental Abuse,"How should I deal with someone who has mental health issues that make them feel satisfaction from causing others emotional distress?

I live with family. I was just about to move out but developed a serious medical issue that I've been dealing with for over a year. In and out of the hospital. Making me unable to work. Unable to move out. Don't have anywhere else to go.

One of my family members messes with me. He's 70 years old. Not blood related. I know he hates me but everything I do makes things worse. He claims to have no issue with me but I KNOW he's been stealing from me and doing really petty weird things. It's a facade he puts up so my family doesn't believe me. They won't do anything about what I've told them he does. They want me to catch him on camera. I just wish they'd believe me and see the monster that he really is.

He's diagnosed with a lot of mental health issues that he refuses to take medication for. He has angry mental breakdowns and hits himself.

He broke into my room when I put a lock on my door and my door jam is busted and the door no longer locks. I got cameras but they are cheap and trigger alot of false alerts making it impossible to find the one where he's entering my room. Lots of things in my room have gone missing and been moved around. Usually things I've recently talked to them about. I was telling them about how I had no name brand shoes. I guess I HAD a pair of Adidas shoes in my closet that were a gift. I forgot about. He must have overheard us talking. Only one shoe of the pair was left at the entrance to my closet. The other shoe is now gone. Since I told my family about him going in there he hasn't been back in. I think he's too scared to. So my chances of catching him on camera now are almost zero.

I didn't really suspect him until I saw him running out of my room after I was coming out of the shower. I didn't know what to do or say I just froze. Knew my family wouldn't believe me. So I kept it to myself until I couldn't take it anymore with my medical issues on top of it.

Since then he's found other ways of messing with me. I can't keep anything in my bathroom. It's the only bathroom used by everyone else in the main hallway. Anything I put in there disappears. I rarely drink milk and he drinks a lot of it. Loves leaving the last little bits of things so I barely get anything and have to dispose of the packaging. Or he leaves things open so they go bad or stale. I opened up the fresh milk instead and took a shower. When I went to take a shower the next day my shampoo had milk in it. My cousins have little kids they weren't over the age of 3 at the time. My family blames the kids. Idk how theyd manage to accomplish that. Even screwing the cap back on the shampoo and everything.

I could write a novel of the weird things that have gone missing and things he does to mess with me. If anyone wants a bigger list of things I'll provide it in the comments. My family blames anyone other than him, even going as far as saying my dead grandma is haunting me when no one else has been at the house to explain it. It really sickens me that he does this, even when I'm going through serious medical issues. It sickens me even more how much they defend him.

I need advice on what I can do, what would you do in this situation? Anything I could think of to get back at him I'm scared would just make things worse for me.

I have a few questions:

1.how can I be sure that I have mental exhaustion? How to tell the differences between cfs and mental exhaustion?

2.can mental exhaustion be caused by something other than stress? Like hard and challenging events in your life?

3.Can mental exhaustion be cured? If yes how long it takes?

4.last but not least how to get rid of mental exhaustion? In the shortest period of time?

185,A husbands mental health,"Backstory…my wife (f40’s) and I (m38) have been married for 10 years and together for 15. We got married before I wanted to but she was really pushing for it. We were happy(ish) at the time so I went along with it. (Mistake, I know now. Truth, probably knew then). Now, for the last 9 years she has had one medical issue after another. Seemingly every few months something goes wrong and she has to have a surgery. She also has some mental health issues that have gotten worse over the last year or so. I had undiagnosed adhd and some autism until I was diagnosed 1.5 years ago. 

In the beginning she had stable work and life was good. Over the last 3 years she’s had 5 jobs, because every time she gets a job there is some manager or employee who “is out to get her” or is the company is “poorly run and she just can’t stay there anymore”. 

Between the job/financial issues she creates and the 9 years of there always being an illness or an injury, my nerves are raw. Every time my phone rings when I’m not with her my stomach turns. Has she wrecked her car again, has she injured herself somehow, is she at the hospital? It’s exhausting to live this way. I’m tired. 

I’ve been miserable for a very long time (years) and it’s getting worse. I believe she is miserable too. She recently was talking around the fringes of suicide/self harm without saying she’s going to do it. I’ve recorded (secretly) her outbursts and some of our fights recently. Not sure why but my gut told me to do it. 

We had a fight tonight and she threatened divorce. To which I said fine, if that’s what you want I’m not going to fight it any more. She’s threatened divorce before and I thought maybe we could work thru it but I did tell her if she threatened it again I was done. I’m not going to have that thrown at me as a manipulation tactic every time she wants to fight. 

When I said fine, she changed her tune. She started getting weepy and saying “I don’t know what I would do without you in my life” and “I don’t think I could continue if we were not together anymore”. With her mental health issues and previously dancing on the edge of self harm topics before, I feel like she again is trying to manipulate me. 

I want a divorce, I don’t want to be with her anymore. That being said, I do love her and I do care about her well being. But at what point do I put my health and well being first?

I’m not the person I was before, and I’m not a fan of the person I have become over the years. I want to get back to me and be happy with myself. It’s the only way I can end up being happy with someone else and I am not currently. 

I feel like I know what I need to do but I’m also not sure. I don’t want anything to happen to her and I’m honestly a little afraid something will if I tell her I am done. 

TLDR: I am tired. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. ",1714705050.0,False,1,0,Lanky-Helicopter-511,None,1ciyagd,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ciyagd/a_husbands_mental_health/
186,I am mentally stuck,"I (F24) don't know what to do with my life. I've lost all passion. I've been in the bath for 3 hours because I'm tired of laying in bed or on my couch.

Quick overview of the last year for context:
Everything did a big flip in my life last may. The small company I worked for (10 employees, met my ex there) sold to a married couple. I worked there since i was in high school and was the only job I have worked, the whole environment changed and i handled it ""okay"". 

I also ended a 5 year abusive relationship, we were renting a house and had a dog together. I moved into the spare room with no intention of getting back together but to wait out the lease. He ended up getting one of my good friends pregnant in October and as soon as I found out, I was out in a week. I lost every friend in this time, even my bestfriend. I pushed her away because she was talking bad about me and defending him, saying things like ""what did she expect to happen"", ""her fault for staying so long"". She showed up at the house one day while I was day drinking and packing because she was worried and I stopped responding to her, all she did once she got there was brush off everything I was upset about and invite her boyfriend over to my house and made me stop packing to play a game with them.

Moved back home with my dad and grandmother (mom passed away 2 years ago). My grandmother died in the house at the beginning of December and I had to take time off work so my dad wasn't home alone and her funeral was in another state. I was back at work for a week then we shut down for 2 weeks for the holiday.

New years eve, I total my car. Back to work on January 3rd day went by smooth, dad drove me since I didn't have rental on my insurance. January 4th I get fired 10 minutes after i got there. Exit interview was dude talking shit about me for 30 minutes while I sat there silent. HR didn't known, me and her were really close.

I spent a lot of time with my family after that, brother had a baby on the 2nd (I got to be in the room) so I've been helping with the baby because their other son has leukemia. I've been to every chemo treatment and helping my dad with my grandmother's estate. All the while, trying to figure out what kind of job I want.

Writing it all out feels weird. It feels like I'm telling a story, like it can't be true that this is my life now. This time last year, I was in a long term relationship had a house to ourselves, no roommates. Was successful at my job. Things started falling apart at the same time. I picked myself back up and was making plans for the future. Moving in with my dad was a hiccup, but it was small and I got through it. Adjusted my goals and plans accordingly and kept going. The stress was weighing on me and I tried to keep the effect it had on my job to a minimal. It wasn't bad but the new owners were seeing me at my worst. 

I've delt with depression my whole life. I've been depressed through all of this but it was manageable, it wasn't in my face. Loosing my car and job within 4 days. Just fucking crushed everything. I was already barely holding onto the threads of my life. Now everything I know is gone. Nothing feels real. I am lonely. I avoid my dad. No job, no car, no friends. I was talking to someone new after I moved and since I lost my job that has drifted off. I can't function with my anxiety, I leave the house and I'm tapped out within a few hours. I'm in bed all day then cozy up on the couch in my room for hours playing video games. I leave the room once a day to eat. These last 2 months have felt like a year but also like it just hasn't happened if that makes since?

I don't know where to go or how to start my life back up. I feel completely defeated. Anyway, if you've made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read. It got a lot longer than I intended. Not sure if I'm looking for advice or just needed to pitty myself for a minute and share with someone.

Sorry for any formatting issues or grammatical errors, I'm on mobile and still in the bath (make that 4 hours in the bath).

187,Mental Cadence,"I was wondering if anyone had heard/experienced something my sister just opened up to me about. She explained it as waking up and everything she experiences has a similar cadence or rhythm. She said it’s really hard to explain and she’s afraid that a therapist or psychiatrist would think she’s nuts. She says she’s been dealing with it since she was a kid and that when she wakes up, everything that has a sensory input all are felt with the same rhythm. Ex.-When she was in school the teachers voice wouldn’t process normally, but she would hear the teacher with this rhythm in her mind. Smells, eyesight, etc all are felt in the same kind of sensory cadence.

I’ve been dealing with a lot of mental illness myself for a decade or so now but have never come across something like that before. She has some mental problems like dyslexia and had a bout with a kind of tremors or seizures that the doctors couldn’t diagnose, that then eventually went away.

I was wondering if it could be a type of mild seizure or something and her brain is just “flicking on and off” type thing? I’ve done some research, but since it’s hard to describe I can’t find anything. I’m trying to get her comfortable with the idea of talking to her doc about it and just thought if we had a general idea of what could be similar, maybe she could articulate it better.

191,drugs and mental health?,"Awhile back I was constantly suicidal. Like psychotic level suicidal. I thought something was out to get me and it made me depressed beyond belief to the point that virtually no doctor could convince me to not kill myself. I felt that I absolutely had to do it and it was not optional as the alternative was absolute hell on earth with infinite suffering.

Then one day I injured myself accidently and had a minor surgical procedure. I was prescribed opioids like many people and after the very first pill it instantly pulled me out of an otherwise multi-year long, completely untreatable, psychotic depression cycle. Of course only for a few hours, but it was the largest improvement to my mental health I had ever seen. I actually cried because it was the first time I had felt anything that wasent complete suffering since before I could remember. but then fast forward a bit I went in trying many drugs, opioids, benzos, psychedelics, weed, ect. And honestly, they have helped for the most part. I am still depressed and have bad mood swings, but it is much better than before. I went on a vacation with my wife, took substances pretty much everyday, and had a blast. I was the greatest improvement in my mental health I have seen since before I can remember.

But then comes the negative, which started to become more apparent after about two years, is they are addictive and I am worried if they may effect my physical health . I want to take them all the time because I always feel like shit and they always make me feel better which makes them habit forming. So now I am stuck in the middle. They absolutely improved my quality of life and saved my life from what was otherwise a near guaranteed suicide, but I also now feel like I made a deal with the devil and I now forever owe the man. I didn't fully understand what I was getting myself into and now I kind of feel stuck. overall the drugs have been more helpful than harmful, but I feel trapped and dont really know what to do.

193,Relationship/Mental Health Support," I am looking for some support/advice. I'm Male(23) and my gf is (28). We've been in a rocky relationship for about a year due to the fact we're in two different places in our lives. We have been together for two years and I have never felt love for someone as much as I have for this person. 

Now the different places as mentioned are to do with  kids. My girlfriend is at a place where she wants to be a mum and settle down. Which I have always told her from the beginning this was not for me right now as I want to go to uni and study a degree and also potentially move to another country/travel. So in no way looking to settle down and start a family right now. Due to the cost of living and the financial burden. Also not feeling mature and responsible enough to bring up a child. I myself am dealing with a  lot at the moment with my mental health. I have an addiction as well as being unemployed and in debt so things are pretty dire.

So in November we found out that my girlfriend was pregnant. Now at this time she was taking contraception as my girlfriend always was understanding of my situation and feelings. I trust her 100% on this however as the pill isn't 100% she ended up getting pregnant. 

Now in this situation I still had a job and I wanted to stand by her decision to keep the baby as I knew it was what she wanted and it had happened I didn't want to take that away from her. However I had my doubts but as the weeks went on the prospect of being a father and having a good enough job to get by. With someone I love so deeply aswell as a kid which I have always wanted I was dare I say looking forward to the idea.

However unfortunately at 12 weeks my girlfriend miscarried and we lost the baby. Following me losing my job the same week and losing the house we were going to move into due to me losing my income. She was devastated ofcourse and I was overwhelmed with feelings of grief but also guilt and I still feel sick to say it relief as it wasn't what I wanted and all the doubts I had became even stronger in regards to me not being ready for this. Following the miscarriage I stayed with my girlfriend for a week to be there for her but didn't explain what I was feeling because I knew the hurt it would cause. After this I went and stayed with friends a few hours away as they are my best mates from where I used to live. After having space and getting prospective I decided that if the relationship meant having a kid then I wasn't ready for it and I was prepared to end it. 

When I got back my girlfriend didn't give me any choice other than try again or leave. So I said I would leave and explained how I felt. She wasn't happy but accepted it

 after this we we're broken up for 3 weeks. In this time my then ex girlfriend would not give me time and space no matter how much I asked for it and kept asking for me to come back. After weeks of her saying that she wanted me and not a baby and that she was prepared to wait till I was ready. (Me who was highly skeptical) But what happens if you get pregnant again. (Her) I can't promise anything but I will consider sorting it out if it comes to that as after we lost the last baby she didn't want to go through that again. So I agreed to try and see where things go not putting pressure on us and asking us to be open with a what we want and if it doesn't work out then it is what it is. But I had to try as I love her and I felt like I owed her this after everything.

Now we got back together and things were great. My girlfriend started taking the pill again. And things went fairly back to normal as could be after everything. A couple of weeks go by and she got pregnant again.. now I know she was taking the pill but she had just come off her period and it turns out she wasn't covered for 7 days which we both did not know. Which I believe. However now I am in the exact situation I dreaded and I tried to walk away from. She is going to keep it although she said she hasn't fully made up her mind but can't see her going through an abortion which I understand and still completely respect her decision.

However now I am in the exact situation I wanted to avoid and I feel so stupid and regretful and then that makes me feel even more guilty about the whole thing. I just have no idea what to do and not sure whether I would be being true to myself by staying and I am very scared of the idea. However I could never picture myself abondoning my own child as I know how much pain that will also cause. But I also know the trauma of having a regretful father.

195,MENTAL HEALTH ADVICE,"Over the past few weeks I have felt as bad as I ever have. I contribute it to two things, a new medication I started taking and have since stopped. Also, my mother got layed off from her job of which not only means less household income but it also means we're losing our insurance.

This has led me to feel awful, I just feel empty and hopeless. I'm usually someone who loves to go out with the dogs, play video games, and eat. I haven't felt like doing any of those things recently. The loss of appetite is the most concerning because I always eat a lot even when I'm stressed.

I have this empty feeling in my stomach, I used to get it all the time before I got my dogs. When I got my dogs, it was immediately gone.

A lot of things I used to worry about no longer bother me as much because of the dogs. Of course now I'm concerned about things related to them, that's always been my personality. Always worrying. 

I want to believe that most of these feelings are due to the medication. I've heard that with certain medications when you start taking them things can get worse before they get better.

But I also think my mother losing her job is a big part of it, I'm 23 years old I'm a full-time college student who has never had a job.

I'm scheduled to graduate at the end of this year but truthfully, I've done the bare minimum, I cared more about playing video games than studying.

I don't know what I thought, I guess I just had no idea what the real world is really like and assumed things would fall into place. But now that I'm looking for jobs I see that to get a job in my field, computer science, you have to be really proficient which I am not.

Thus terrifies me because I have three dogs that mean everything to me and I want so much to give them a good life, the best food, a big backyard, etc. But, with the economy being the way it is, that's just not possible on an entry level salary.

I'm constantly thinking about the mortality of my family, including my dogs and I feel a sense of urgency to give them the best life now. I feel guilty that where we live now has a backyard but it's not fenced. I feel bad that instead of walking them for 3 hours a day I only do an hour and half. I feel bad then when I start working they'll spend most of the day without me. I'm used to having all day to myself and now that's changing and it scares me.

But what's funny is when I take Adderall I'm able to spin all of these things positive. Instead of being depressed about having to work I get excited about the new experience and the extra money. When I'm on Adderall I'm much more optimistic, energetic, and happy.

I wish I could be like this all the time instead of my normal mopy depressed self. Even when things are good I'm always worrying about something.

All these things I worry about are normal I think but, most people handle them better that I do. I know that things could be much worse ans there are people going through much worse. But, I feel really bad right now. Even when I rationalize my thoughts, after a few minutes I'm back to being depressed.

The medication I stopped taking is oxcarbazepine and now I just take prozac, I just started taking it a few days ago.

I was always hesitant to take medication because I thought I was just being weak and I didn't need it. But, I see that I really do have issues and medication could help. I was diagnosed with mood disorder when I was younger and I definitely have OCD. 

I'm sorry to ramble. I guess my question is, does anyone have experience or advice on how to go from being a pessimist all the time to being optimistic.",1712156605.0,False,1,0,Dapper_Land9415,None,1buuunp,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1buuunp/mental_health_advice/

When I’m in a meeting, I can understand the words, but I almost immediately forget what was said, and can’t really follow people’s train of thoughts to be able to participate.  In fact I’m more than amazed at how many words people are able to think of when they talk. When questions are asked, I’m amazed at how on topic and thoughtful they are. Like, I would have never I’m a million years thought of the question. It just ups my anxiety being in a conversation at all.

When I watch shows, I can barely pay attention. I’ve been streaming shows that I use to find funny, but now I don’t really understand the humor anymore. 

When I am trying to actually do something, I try to write things down. However, I can’t really listen and write things down at the same time since my mind has to focus on what I’m writing. I’ve always had an issue with note taking, in that I rarely go over notes.

My thoughts tend to get stuck on the same things over and over again. Seems like obsessive thoughts (OCD?). So I think that my obsessive thoughts do not allow me to process new information.  Recently I’ve done research about learning and such and I don’t believe I’ve ever put in as much effort as normal people do to learn things (reading, taking notes, reviewing, teaching, reviewing again, etc.). People put order of magnitudes more effort in their life it seems. I don’t really fathom how people do it and manage to do anything else in their life. I feel I could spend all my time trying to learn something and never really understand it. But I also feel as though I should understand things a lot easier now.

Anyway, I’m trying to figure out what I can even do at this point. It seems like all my life has led me to the point of not understanding things anymore and I don’t know how to fix it. Can I even recover from this at 48? I understand the concept of neuroplasticity, but the lack of exercising my brain seems to have led to such atrophy and loss of memory that I need to basically start over, unlearn all my bad habits, and relearn everything.

Only issue is my office won’t provide the funding unless I can prove the boxes are evidence based. I have tried telling them creating a mental health plan and everything in the box is evidence based as a coping mechanism. I was just wondering if anyone has any ideas to help convince them or know of an evidence based program I can show my office that is similar to the boxes.

I have anxiety that I’ve been managing for a few years, so we talked a lot about mental health when we were together. 

How long would you wait to reach out after the breakup? I want to give him space to concentrate on life and get some clarity, but I also care about him. 

Has anyone been through this type of a breakup before? 

We had only been dating for a few months but had a really good connection and I could definitely tell he had a lot of life stressors going on that he wanted and needed to resolve. He was still figuring out how to cope and manage it in healthy ways.

I won’t put my life on hold, but maybe things could work out in the future if he feels like he has his life more put together?

I think mental health isn't targeted enough in music. Thus I made a very personal track called Addiction.

Thus its written in major and minor key, constantly shifting between feeling high and low. 

It also contains many musical impressions from my personal Background. The beat is a Psytrance beat, and it contains a lot of metal elements, a genre that has shaped my personal musical journey.

213,My dad's mental health needs to improve for the sake of my mental health,"I am 31M. My dad is 60. My dad has anger issues. It's been something that's effected me a lot because as a child, I was afraid of him. He was never really directly angry at my or my sister, but it always felt directed. He would and still does get angry over minor inconveniences, mainly anything to do with technology or not being able to figure something out. He basically throws tantrums. 

He recently offered to let me move in with him. I was living in a sober house, and he used to not even want me in his house so that's a big step. My mental health was degrading fast in that house too,  ur that's another post for another day. Our relationship has always been distant, we can barely have small talk, and I don't want our relationship to be like that. I want it to be stronger. 

It's been a week and it's been slightly difficult being around him. Mainly because I become scared the same way I was when I was a kid. It's not so much scary as just being very uncomfortable when he's angry. It's hard to even talk to him when he's like that and I just want to leave the room. 

He had another tantrum this morning over the DVR. I want to get closer to me dad, I want our relationship to be better, but I can't do it with these tantrums. It's embarrassing. His anger is unwarranted. He won't even try to learn and for that I have lost respect for him as a man and as my father. This is a problem in the way of us becoming closer. I don't respect him. 

I've been going over it all day, how can I help him? Why is he so angry? Why is he so angry at technology? It seems like it's not just regular anger, he seems to have a very deep resentment of technology. What did technology ever do to him?

And that's when it clicked. 

About 7 years ago, I was living with him and I was just starting to lose control of my alcoholism. I used to be functioning, but it was going downhill fast. 

One morning I was too sick to go to work, and my dad tried to motivate me. He shared with me that about 7 years prior to that moment, he was fired from a very good job as a senior scientist at a power company. (My parents never told me sister and I the reason for this, we were too young, they just told us his time there was done). He revealed to me that the reason he was fired was because he was caught looking at pornography on his work computer. 

There it is. That explains so much. In multiple ways. 

He was part of a community he was ostracized out of. He had a lot of friends there and we would go over to their houses. 

He was embarrassed and shamed in front of his coworkers. 

It was the beginning of the end of his marriage (my parents divorced a few years after and their relationship was toxic, lots of fighting, lots of fear from me, which lead to some of the issues I have today)

He hated being emasculated. My mom told me several times that he told her he resented her because she had a higher salary. 

My dad is a very smart person and if this didn't happen I'm sure he would have had a great career. 

Now it all makes sense. He hates technology because it sort of ruined his life. And he blames tech, not himself. 

Now, advice I'm looking for, is what the hell do I do with this info? I was planning on talking to him about his anger problems, but talking about the source here is not appropriate for a father/son conversation. He needs professional help. 

I know it's not my responsibility to help my father but I love him and I want him to find peace, for my sake and his own. He remarried to a wonderful woman who puts up and tolerates him, and we all wonder just how much she tolerates. She also makes more than him (he was laid off about 5 years ago). I can't let this go. I can't settle knowing my dad has a wound like this. I'm a very empathetic person so whenever someone around me is in emotional pain, it hurts me too. 

Can someone offer any advice on what I can do to help? Should I just forget about it and try to move on? Should I try walking him through technology? Should I get real with him and tell him he acts like a big baby?

(I had originally posted this on the mental illness reddit but I decided to post it on here aswell.)

For the past few months I've suspected that I have something whether it's a anxiety disorder or a personality disorder because of some few things. For information: I am a 16 year old male

For almost a year I have been attached to someone who is now my friend (we've been friends for almost a year now). I secretly like them before we became friends and I had a huge crush on them to the point I was desperate to get into contact with them from their friend because I was scared to talk to them myself, eventually we became friends but I think that's when it went downhill fast. We became friends very quickly and we would text each other alot which I was very excited about but I would later find myself become anxious and angry if they didn't respond to my text or if they didn't respond in the way I wanted them to. I started to brush it off but it became more extreme to the point I would cry over them and feel very extreme emotions for them both negative and positive. Keep in mind this was all me, they haven't done anything wrong it's extremely one sided on my end. I still feel these emotions now  but they sometimes die down or become extreme.

Secondly, my anxiety. Yes, it's sorta related to the same person but other things contribute aswell. I am extremely anxious and feel intense emotions when it comes to this person. I feel very happy or upset whenever this tries person talks to me or when they text me. Whenever they get uspet at me I become extremely sad or submissive as a way to make them forgive me for some reason and I become empty or emotionless. (This happens when someone gets angry at me in general.) Relating to my anxiety I find myself getting anxious/extremely irritated over small things until they piled up on me which lead up to me being extermely paranoid and start feeling dreadful or anxious to the point where i fidget (grabbing hair, scratching myself etc) and I feel detached sometimes. It's also a thing whenever I get anxious about something I become maniac (??) I start to become weirdly happy and careless about everything and I feel reckless in my mind I also feel somewhat empty whenever this happens aswell.

I avoid talking to people in groups and I become paranoid and stress out whenever someone says something I don't like and it affects my entire day. I dont know if this is related to something or if I have have something but I think all of these things are related to traumatic/certain stuff happening to me as I grew up.

224,Mental Health: Mind Matters,"Hey, community!!   


Mental health is a topic close to our hearts, and it's high time we shed some light on it. In this post, we'll stroll through the complexities of mental well-being, offering simple insights and tips to help us all on this journey. Remember, your mind matters, and so does everyone else's.  
  
**Understanding Mental Health:**  
Let's start with the basics. Mental health refers to our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It impacts how we think, feel, and act, influencing how we handle stress, relate to others, and make decisions. Just like physical health, mental health is crucial for a fulfilling life.  
  
**Common Mental Health Challenges:**  
Many of us face mental health challenges, and that's okay. Anxiety, depression, and stress are more common than we might think. It's crucial to recognize these struggles and seek support when needed. Remember, you're not alone.  
  
**Self-Care Strategies:**  
Taking care of our mental health involves simple yet powerful strategies. Regular exercise, sufficient sleep, and a balanced diet contribute to overall well-being. Additionally, finding activities that bring joy, practicing mindfulness, and setting realistic goals can make a significant difference in how we feel.  
  
**Breaking the Stigma:**  
There's a stigma surrounding mental health, but it's time to break free from it. Seeking help doesn't make you weak; it makes you resilient. Let's foster an environment where open conversations about mental health are encouraged, without judgment.  
  
**Building a Support System:**  
Whether it's friends, family, or professionals, having a support system is crucial. Share your thoughts and feelings with those you trust. Sometimes, a simple conversation can alleviate the weight on your shoulders.  
  
**When to Seek Professional Help:**  
If you find that your mental health is significantly impacting your daily life, don't hesitate to seek professional help. Therapists, counselors, and mental health professionals are here to provide the support and guidance you need.  
  
**Conclusion:**  
In the grand tapestry of life, mental health is a vital thread. Let's weave a supportive and understanding community where everyone feels empowered to prioritize their well-being. Remember, your mind matters, and so do the minds of those around you

228,Mental health and seeking happiness,"Has anyone ever felt Soo much painful thoughts that cause stress and anxiety that over time the thoughts no longer hurt but you still don't feel the same. You're emotions are fine but a void is present where stress and anxiety should be. I don't feel like myself as much but that's nothing new. For some reason the thoughts don't cause me pain anymore but that isn't a good thing. Something feels ""off"" with my brain. I want to seek mental health but what exactly can I say? What can they do? Will they even understand? My nearest mental health center is at a clinic and it's a walk in therapy center. Are they qualified? What if they misdiagnose me with something. It's scary asking for help",1713766950.0,False,1,3,minning_lord,None,1ca3of0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ca3of0/mental_health_and_seeking_happiness/
