0,Question about outpatient,"I’ve been in a rut for a really long time and it’s just getting worse. My therapists have mentioned IOP and my parents want me to try something because they feel like they can’t help me anymore. I’ve also had difficulty with medication and feeling hopeless at the moment. I don’t need over night stay but soemthing everyday. I think it would be good to because I can tell them exactly what’s going on and the psychiatrist is well trained to know what can help me the quickest. I have so many issue atm ocd intrusive thoughts, depression, anxiety, panic disorder agoraphobia, gad, and when I don’t think it can get worse it does. Is there a way to do outpatient without the group stuff but get the therapy in and the med situation figured out? I know the point is to be around people to know ur not alone but I’m just embarassed what if I see someone I know and don’t want to get more anxious ideas in my head that I’ll hear from other people especially showing up as new ocd themes. I just wish there was something where I didn’t have to do the group part. Is that possible? Have any of you seen relief in an IOP program, especially in the medication management? I just think meds are the way to go with me- I’ve tried therapy for so so long and just not cutting it. I want to be normal and do things I used to and not feel so terrible everyday. And it sucks meds take weeks to work I’m so tired of the trial and error it’s very exhausting. I want to get life on track this summer and attend school again in fall. Anyone have any advice for me?

1,Positive outpatient experiences w finding right meds?,"Hellooo idk if anyone cares butttt I got on a waitlist for outpatient- may move up to higher level if I need to. I’ll start first or second week of May. I’m really hoping they will finally get me on the right medication I’m just so sick of constantly trying things it j keep messing w my head mentally exhausting stressed about it everyday and physically my body is just run downnnn. 
Anyone have positive experiences in them finding the right meds through outpatient/inpatient any type of treatment center? 

My np was also supposed to do a referral to the center for me Friday and she never did it. I left a message to her office (since they didn’t pick up) yesterday morning to ask if she sent it in/if she could do it and I still haven’t gotten a call back. So I did it all today myself and asked the center if they got a referral from her they said no. Do I call her office again and tell her they need her records? Cus they do to get me on right treatment. I feel annoying calling again but this should be taken seriously on her part I’m worried she dropped me as a patient or something it’s really weird. She also started me on a new med and I asked when should our follow up appointment be and she said she will do the referral, they will call me back and set up a time for me to start, and then when that’s completed I will call her to let her know that the center and I set something up and her and I will then set up an appointment to meet. If that made any sense. But she’s literally not answering and now I have to call to get my records in, and to try to set up an appointment with her. Can I be dropped without knowing? Ugh I’m so stressed out over this right now and stressed over my meds because I just want to feel better and want to start something that will help me and I don’t think abilify will benefit all my issues in the long run.

10,Psychiatrist reccomended Intensive Outpatient. Is it worth it?,"Long story short im 18 and Ive been suicidal+self harming since I was 10. Ive struggled with trauma, disordered eating, skin picking, anxiety, etc you get the idea. I feel bad like 90% of the time and its been this way as long as i can remember. Ive been on meds and therapy on and off (currently about to start meds, seeing a therapist)

So basically I saw a psychiatrist and she said that from my ""levels of distress"" i should really consider Intensive Outpatient Programs.

I'm good student who always shows up to class and gets A's and B's only, I work part time and am always reliable. I've learned how to dissasociate myself from my emotions so I can easily calm myself down and stay safe when things are a lot. I don't intend to kms in the near future. No matter how bad things get, I can lock it away, go to work and class and remain functional

Is IOP worth it?

11,Outpatient Plan,"Tw: suicide, depression, etc. A little background. I'm a SPED teacher. Fifth year. Burnt out since year three. I tried to make it work. Honestly maybe without all the COVID craziness I'd be fine. It was so small but a co-teacher shit talking me in front of the kids knowing I can't respond was what broke the camels back. Now even thinking about going into the building I physically vomit. 

I went to the ER for suicidal thoughts last night. Haven't been myself for a while. No plan, I have people who love me but going was at the recommendation of my counselor who suggested I need an immediate medication change. 

I'm trying to figure out how to make the work. The psych wrote me a note out until the fifth, but the thought of going in.. I don't know that I can. 

Part of my out patient plan is that I will quit and find another job. I've already been doing that and have some exciting possibilities lined up. I'm now concerned the school system will give me poor references. Probably just paranoia- I hope. 

I'm more than happy to work from home. I'm SPED so I could do IEPs- probably even do homebound, but I don't think I can return to the school. I'm talking to the principal tomorrow to try to sort this out and I'm not sure how candid I should be.

12,Inpatient and outpatient treatment.,"My boyfriend and family have been concerned about me and my mental health lately and I understand where they’re coming from with it and agree fully that I do need to receive the proper care because what I am doing currently is not working for me. I do see a therapist weekly and a psychiatrist every 1-2 months but I’ve made little to no progress with myself and in regards to my safety and welling being in 2 years. My boyfriend wants me to look into an inpatient facility and receive treatment that way. I disagree with him on that, because I can’t afford to miss work and inpatient will be a however long ordeal because once I go into a facility my life is in their hands for however long they see fit for me. The option of being able to miss work for 1-7 days or longer is not a choice I can make in my life at this moment, I’ve been previously admitted 4 times and really don’t want to go back. 


So I guess what I’m trying to get to with this post is, what other options can I do for outpatient treatments or ideas that will help me make the progress I need and deserve to have for myself? I’m located in Missouri, USA.


TLDR: Family and significant other worried about my mental health and safety. They want me to do inpatient treatment, but can’t afford to do so.

13,Outpatient facility,"My bipolar2 SO is out of inpatient and just started an outpatient program 5 days a week. It’s day two and already the doctor is dismissive and cold, the group therapies are holding rocks and small activities, and when she is having an anxious episode is being told that she needs to use tools and there is no “magic pill”. This angers me because there is no “magic tool” either…she is trying her absolute hardest and in a place where she is supposed to feel cared for is feeling like a burden and made to feel like it’s all on her. Is there a process to try and switch outpatient programs or should I call and professionally lose my shit on the facility? After watching her suffer for so long and seriously try her absolute best to get through every day I’m so sick of people making it harder on her.

14,About to start an intensive outpatient program and I’m really anxious. I could use some encouragement.,I have had very bad anxiety and panic attacks my entire life. I also have severe separation anxiety from my parents and agoraphobia. I’m now about to turn 24 and I realize I have to do something to heal and recover so I can live free of panic attacks and so I can life independently. I’ve tried basically everything so far except for this and I’m hoping with all hope that this will cause the breakthrough I need. I’m very anxious though as it is out of my comfort zone and challenges my two biggest anxieties so I need encouragement.

15,13 year old self-harm & DBT outpatient program?,"My 13 year old daughter (7th grade) has been cutting herself and feeling suicidal. We did not realize the severity of her suicidal thoughts nor the degree to which she was cutting herself. A few months ago she had taken a small knife to school with her and someone reported it - months later. She was not carrying the knife on this day in February but admitted carrying it previously. She was suspended out of school for 10 days. She was looking forward to returning to school though stressed out about the ""rumors"" going around that she had a knife and had been cutting herself.

Long story short, she has a psychiatrist (for adhd) and a great therapist, who has only seen her twice but it is a good fit. She began taking Lexapro two weeks ago and her mood is MUCH improved.

My daughter was accepted into an Intensive Outpatient Program (locally considered the ""gold standard"" ) that uses DBT for self-harm. I have heard outstanding things about the program.

The program is 30 days / 6 weeks. She would be out of her middle school for the six weeks. The entire family would do Family Therapy weekly and my DH and I would have to attend weekly Parenting Group that focus on utilizing DBT - I'm assuming. The location is over an hour from our house and would mean ""commuting"" 2 - 2 1/2 hours daily in downtown metro traffic. All of this is quite fine and we are MORE than willing to do it. I'd MUCH rather do this than have my beautiful, brilliant daughter hurting herself or killing herself.

We are concerned about this because she was already stressed by missing two weeks of school. She loves her teachers and enjoys her classes. My husband and I can't decide if we should send her to the program OR if the intensity of the outpatient program will be traumatic and detrimental to her sense of ""fitting in"" at school / school rumors, etc.... The whole, ""my parents put me in a psych hospital"" bit....

This is also on our minds:

If we do the Outpatient Program, we will all be home during Spring Break.  She is REALLY looking forward to the trip we've planned (the destination is her pick), as are our other children.

DH and I are going to ask if there are additional start date options, including summer - which would be ideal because it would preclude the whole school drama. However, again - our family travel plans would be impacted, changed, or dropped entirely.

Again, our daughter's well-being is the highest priority and we just want to make sure we are making the best possible decision for her and NOT causing her additional trauma and harm.

I am really hoping some of you would be willing to give me some insights. Thank you in advance for your sensitivity and willingness to share.",1645903452.0,False,4,9,CricketsMoon,None,t24w0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/t24w0j/13_year_old_selfharm_dbt_outpatient_program/

25,Who came up with 45-60 minutes as the one size of an outpatient therapy appointment?,"I don’t seem to be able to use a chunk of time this size at all. 

In regular life I’m good for 15-20 minutes of life updates, and then I’m itching to go. 

Or I hang out quietly with someone for about 2 hours and only then get comfortable enough to open up emotional topics, which then take an hour or three to address. 

But this business of show up, immediately spill guts, remind therapist of my backstory because they’ve forgotten it due to having 25 clients a week, listen to their responses and strategies for dealing with general stress, I can’t fit that into the prescribed time. 

I’m either cagey and curating what I share, or I end up feeling like a shucked clam, opened and tossed aside. It’s not the therapist’s fault, there’s not much you can do when you have to close a meeting on time. That’s the format. 

Grounding exercises to ‘close’ the session are no help at all to me when I’m feeling dismissed (and when that’s literally what’s happening). It feels like a performance I have to engage in so the professional can clear their head and focus on the next patient. I’m not a monster, I’ll still pretend to calm down because it’s the minimum of social consideration. 

 The schedule just seems so strange and artificial. It’s like being a kid and  having seven subjects a day in school, wasting half the day transitioning between classes and remembering less than half of what else goes on because it gets flushed out by the next subject.

26,How do I know I need additional help? (Outpatient),"I have Bipolar type 1, anxiety (managed 90% with meds), C-PTSD and DID.

I'm on a whole cocktail of meds including anti-psychotics, mood stabalizers, and anti-anxiety medication. My boyfriend says I'm 75% stable. While I do agree that I am doing much better especially with the help of trauma therapy, I feel like I could be more put together, motivated and productive. As a college student taking what is constantly being called the hardest part of my college career, I really need to be on my A-game at all times. I could either make it out alive and live a happy, successful life with my boyfriend, look forward to having kids and make $200k a year by the time I'm 35 or drop out, be miserable, give up on my aspirations in life and work a minimum wage job feeling like I fucked up one of the best opportunities of my life.

When I get triggered, it's really bad and I'm driven to the point of having suicidal thoughts and wanting to self harm. My mental illness is causing my boyfriend a lot of stress especially because we live together. It's getting in the way of my schoolwork too.

I'm in therapy once a week (my therapist accommodates and has sessions up to 3 times a week with me when I'm really stressed out) but my therapist is just someone I dump my drama and problems to. No CBT, DBT or EMDR.

32,Should I go back into inpatient or an outpatient program?,"I've had an awful four years. I've written here before but I've had the worst three weeks this past month. I went into the hospital last September. Then I did an outpatient program for about a month and a half. 

I feel like I've gotten no better, almost no help at all. Being in the programs were okay in that it gave me some structure but honestly I left with almost the same headspace. I constantly put on a face when I'm in these programs, I make it seem like I'm feeling better, and maybe I do for a bit, but it never lasts and I'm only saying so to get out of the program. 

I havent gotten any kind of diagnosis that's been helpful, its taken a whole year to change my meds, my therapist is nice but I don't feel like I come away from the sessions with anything helpful. I often feel worse after each week. 

Im unemployed, I can't get up in the morning, I need to move because I want to be closer to my doctors office. I know my parents would take me in, but I've been struggling like this for four years now. Going from job to job, being unemployed and out of housing and not being able to manage my depression and general mental state. 

I know the logical thing to do is to go back into a program, but I really really don't want to. Being in the hospital made my dissociation so much worse, and being in the outpatient groups honestly made me feel worse about myself seeing other folks feel better. 

I also don't think I can afford to go into a program.

I feel like I'm constantly in crisis, it's been three weeks and I haven't been able to work or feed myself or get out of the apartment. 

I need some kind of support or help and I dont know what that looks like. 

I don't care if I don't get a diagnosis of anything other than depression but I want to at least explore the possibilities and so far no one I've spoken to has helped me with that. 

TLDR: I've felt like I'm in crisis for three weeks but I've been through the loop of hospital, outpatient, to outside therapist four times in the last four years and I dont feel like I've ever gotten the help I need.

33,Intensive outpatient program vs partial hospitalization program? Alexandria VA area,"Hi I was wondering if anyone has experience with either of these programs? All advice and recommendations welcome. My mental health has reached a point where I think I need to be making it my main priority and getting back on medication and in therapy. I have done weekly therapists before and it hasn’t been enough and the idea of a structured program sounds like it will be extremely beneficial to me and help me turn my life around. I have struggled with severe depression and anxiety for the last decade or so and have tried antidepressants etc but have been quick to give up when I found they weren’t working and my suicidal thoughts/ideation as of lately have been much more difficult to control and more active rather than passive, which is obviously scary. I also struggle with panic attacks and could potentially have another mood disorder or something else. I called a helpline today and the lady also mentioned looking into ketamine treatment if anyone has experience with that. Also I am not employed at the moment and think it’s a great opportunity to really focus on my mental health that I’ve overlooked far too much and make a change. 

My other question is: do you think this will all be done via telehealth/video because of COVID-19? It has made everything so much more difficult.

39,Need Advice. Should I go for DBT as an inpatient or non-specific therapy as an outpatient?,"I (23, F) have a decision to make and I am extremely overwhelmed right now. 

I am faced with the decision of going to a DBT ward for another 9 weeks as an inpatient. Or outpatient therapy twice a week and try to return to everyday life with additional outpatient help. 

Unfortunately, there is no outpatient option for DBT here.

I was previously an inpatient in a psychosomatic clinic for 3 months and was diagnosed with a severe depressive episode and borderline. Afterwards, I spent 2 months as a partial inpatient, which unfortunately didn't really help. 

After the clinic, my problems were only really tangible. All of a sudden my emotions really threw me off track, I had to deal with enormous fear of loss and failure like never before. I am completely blocked for many things. I can't judge for myself how unstable I am right now and what I need. 

Now when I could start this DBT place next week I can only see someone for an hour a day because of Corona, no time off or weekends.

The feeling of being locked up and even more forced distance from my boyfriend and few friends is extremely upsetting and frightening. 

My job training (Germany) would have to be extended by a year as a result. 

In the scenario with outpatient therapy... 
In the best case scenario, I would be able to finish my job training in time. But after that, I'd be right back at work. And I have no idea whether I would be able to do that.

40,Wish me luck with Intensive Outpatient care,"Hey. I’m really new to Reddit (and generally sharing stuff online at all) so forgive me if I do things wrong. For context, I’ve been diagnosed with severe GAD and major depressive disorder, and I also self harm (though that term is kind of muddy in this situation, it’s more of a bodily-focused repetitive behavior as far as I can tell, but who knows). I’m a senior in high school, which has been the easiest and hardest year of at least my academic career, if not my life—easiest because I have only two academic classes with some art school things I’ve done for years, and hardest because my mental state has deteriorated so far from what it was even six months ago, let alone a year. Since I was 11 or 12 I’ve received counseling and a few years after that I started taking meds, which has been an ongoing experiment because my mental state has so many different factors (dissociation, paranoia, compulsive self-injury, sensory sensitivity, hallucinations, and more) and on top of that my body is extremely sensitive to psychotropic drugs, so I experience negative side effects quickly and often (a curse as much as a blessing).

I’ve seen two counselors, one licensed by my school and one from a local practice, for around two years or so, though I’ve seen the former for much longer as a supplement for the other. Just today the personal counselor voiced concern for my safety due to recent suicidal ideation in combination with my worsening self-injury (rather than using sharp utensils to cut into my skin, I pick and squeeze with what little nails my fingers have and subsequently ingest the contents, making us lean more in the direction of a compulsion than a desire to hurt myself; but I digress). I’ve been fortunate in having a wonderful support group around me for as long as I can remember—my family, friends, peers, teachers, counselors, and doctors are all amazing people that truly care about me and are good at what they do, and it’s been like that for my entire life—and my parents and I trust my counselor’s judgement in this regard. She suggests I should be moved into a more intensive outpatient group, actively “targeting” suicidal and self-harming intents and actions for a few times a week. Part of me is sad that I’ve reached this point of concern, but I’m honestly relieved I can get help that’s in-between CBT and a stay in the hospital. I feel like I’m a danger to myself at home—I self-injure at least twice a day, to the point that I’ve had to go to see a wound specialist to aid in healing various infections I’d contracted—and I’m hopeful that I can become stable before I start college in the fall.

This is really long-winded, and I’m sorry if it’s too much information or something. I just wanted to get that off of my chest, in a community that knows exactly how I feel. 
For those of you that have gone through this process before, do you have any tips? This is my first time in a group setting for therapy, so advice on that would be greatly appreciated.

55,When to consider residential inpatient vs outpatient therapy (TW suicide mention),"Hello everyone.

I’ve been struggling with my mental health lately and I’m finding myself more and more scared of my recovery efforts. I continue to feel suicidal, helpless and worthless- I don’t want to get better, it feels like. I’ve posted in the past about some issues I’ve had.

I currently attend a two hour DBT skills class once a week and therapy for an hour once a week. I’ve known DBT skills for quite some time. Practicing them has mixed results but never takes away my depressive/suicidal feelings. I am uninsured technically but receive some coverage through the county I live in (I’m in NC).

Two weeks ago I went to the hospital for a minor attempt and psychosis. I felt better psychosis-wise once I was off the meds I took(I started a new one recently and hello another reaction), but that is part of the pattern I’ve noticed. I was simply feeling guilty for stressing out my partner with our separation and feeling restless in the hospital waiting to figure out where I would be placed (although I don’t enjoy most activities I still try to pass time and distract myself- usually this makes me feel mindless and numb even when engaging in mindfulness/etc). So I lied about my suicidal feelings to the doctor so I could go home, and agreed to continue recovering at home with my outpatient resources.

I was inpatient a few times last year. It’s not a ball being there, so I’m not itching to go back. Yet I somehow felt like I was able to focus on my recovery there. I attended daily classes to stay active and met with a psychiatrist and therapist about every other day or everyday. It was not a low stress environment or anything nor is it some sort of “vacation”.

I’m wondering if it’s not the step I need to take, being there for a bit, establishing some sort of progress and then stepping down. Transitioning isn’t easy but I’m unemployed and aside from my partner have nothing else going for me. My therapist got a little crabby when I mentioned how I felt I got out and like I’m not able to make myself take the steps in recovery I need to (not that I even know what those are?? I can’t even imagine a few days from now for myself, I’m getting by day to day), and she snappily said maybe the hospital is right for me and I’m never going to get better. She was trying to challenge my thinking, but it honestly just made me feel worse. I’m just so tired of everything and with fibromyalgia, it’s all really hard for me. I feel so guilty, especially comparing myself to others (which I try not to do because I get my problems are valid but ugh).

60,How do you seek help and not get discouraged by how poor our mental health system is?,"This is a question but I need to rant so venting seems better for post flair.

I overdosed 2 weeks ago on benadryl. this was the closest I came to actually probably dying, and i want help. Here is a bullet point of my experience thus far:

□i spent about 2 days in a psych hospital. I met with a psychiatrist for 10 mins and was prescribed lamictal

□i am told to call another psych hospital to do an assessment for outpatient. I do, and the hospital recommends residential which I refuse. I say i want to do intensive outpatient, but I am told i need a therapist referal for that.

□i dont have one, so i contact psychiatrist from the hospital i was inpatient with. I get connected to a rude man who takes my message and literally hangs up on me

□days later i get a call back, am connected to 4 people, one hangs up on me again. I call 3 numbers and am finally connected. I get told that they cant refer me because the hospital i want to do outpatient with wont accept out of network referals....okay.

I literally attempted suicide, and the therapist appointment the hospital made for me is 2 months out, and i cant do the outpatient i wanted to do.

Heres the othet thing: this psychiatrist from the inpatient hospital put on the report: ""final diagnoses from this level of care: PTSD and borderline personality disorder."" among other things i knew about.

i was never told I was being diagnosed with those. I told her BPD was _suggested_ to me but never formally diagnosed because the dr at the time couldnt diagnose. She put in her notes that i said i was diagnosed. what the hell???

to diagnose me with 2 serious disorders and not tell me??? how does this work?

on top of that, this is my 6th medication and this upcoming therapist will be my 5th. I am 23 and first attempted suicide at 11, so i am no stranger to this system.

Some background: Mom first developed symptoms of schizophrenia over 30 years ago. During most of this time she has not take medication and has been cared for at home by Dad. However in the past few years her condition has deteriorated and she has gone through several cycles of health care intervention, a period of taking atypical anti-psychotics and then going off medication due to side effects. We are looking to follow up on the previous hospitalization with outpatient care and the family is wondering what we should be looking for. The questions I've proposed so far are:

* Are there family therapy sessions available? Can Dad attend the group / family therapy sessions? Can we be designated to attend when possible as well?

* How does outpatient care improve the various scenarios we encounter? Medication compliance / adjustment / side-effect monitoring and changes. What happens when Mom stops taking medicine and refuses to go to weekly meetings? Can we look into transitioning off nasty SSRIs with intense brain zap side effects?

* How much does insurance cover? What are the financial implications so that Mom and Dad don't have to worry or make excuses about getting good care?

* What can Dad do when she stops taking medication?

62,Help understanding mental health costs,"Hi all, 
I hope this is the right subreddit for this. I am trying to get health insurance but mental health care coverage is my #1 priority right now. 

I have found 3 plans that I think might work but because I'm not familiar with insurance or out of pocket costs for mental health care I'm confused
 about what option would be the best. 

*One is $115/month, $0 deductible, $40 PCP visit, $100 mental health outpatient services. 

*The other is $97.86/month, $8,000 deductible,   $0 PCP, 40% mental health outpatient services. 

*The last is $95.49/month, $7,500 deductible, $50 PCP, and $50 mental heath outpatient services. 
I just don't understand all this stuff. Is 40% going to cost me less than $50 or $100? 

(The monthly premium is based on income and tax breaks.)

I'm currently handling my me tal health through Cerebral, which does not take insurance. I pay $85/month even if I don't see a psychiatrist that month...typically every 3 months. I don't think this is a plan they offer anymore, so if I cancel cerebral, I'll have to choose a more expensive plan. 

At this point, I'm far enough along in my treatment where I don't need regular sessions. I just need them to approve my medications. Is that something a PCP can do without needing to see a psychiatrist?

Last year she had a break down and had to take a 3 month leave from work. She was miserable the whole time with guilt and anxiety and depression. She got a role with less responsibility at work but that hasn’t seemed to help. She did start seeing a therapist this past year and recently just finished doing a weekly ketamine therapy for 6 weeks. She doesn’t feel like it helped. She’s had more days where she has said she wants a different quality of life. She started listening to podcasts (Joe Dispenza, Les Brown, Wayne Dyer) and at times I feel like she’s making progress and on the verge of a breakthrough because she speaking up a bit more and acknowledging her thoughts and how they harm her.  But this week she’s had a huge backslide and tried quitting her job and I believe is having suicidal thoughts based on what she told me and my dad.

TL;DR: [Seeking advice: 27F, new to mental health treatment] Therapist of a couple months referred me to an outpatient program. The assigned Therapist never showed up to the follow-up and psychiatrist was belittling. 

-- 

(Forgive me in advance, this is an incredibly long post and dialogue; I've also made a TL;DR version too) I was seeing therapist for a couple of months (Beginning of May--late June) until she thought it was best for me to be in a more extensive program. I found her through my psychiatrist's referral list.

Being that I (27F) never explored mental health treatment/being on meds for the first time and building this connection with her, I trusted her judgement.

She referred me to an outpatient program. I'm in the process of the evaluations (saw the therapist and psychiatrist in the last 2 weeks) but, I feel so many red flags. I don't have a benchmark to compare these feelings with but, I just know when my gut doesn't feel right. 

Below is the extensive timeline of my treatment so far in the new program as of 07/07:

-07/07 As I was checking into my first appointment last week, the nurse in the front desk took my info and said, ""the therapist told you to arrive a half hour early to fill out paperwork"", She didn't. I never even spoke to her; I was speaking directly with their program director. After saying I wasn't informed of that, she ignored me.

-The appointment was fine. I thought it was nice of her to process my appointments right then and there before I left, both for my follow-up and  an appointment with the psychiatrist... until the day came, and I didn't receive an email with a virtual session invite nor a phone call. 

-Eventually I called her; she returned my call, saying that she ""must've forgot to confirm my appointment in her system""...... thankfully, I had a day off so, when she asked if I had any window of time open, I took it.

-Virtual meeting was fine (my previous therapist was remote so, I didn't mind it at all). She asked how I was feeling, I was talking through it... and then, suddenly, at 30 mins, she cuts me short and says ""were out of time"". I didn't realize it was only a half hour.

-This week was my psychiatrist appointment virtually at 10am. 10:10 rolls around; nothing. 10:30... so I call my therapist, pretty much politely asking wtf is going on. I'm working from home right now so, luckily it's not a time constraint. But, nonetheless, it's still wasted time.

-Ironically, a couple of minutes after leaving her a voicemail, I receive a text message - ""[Dr. John Smith] is inviting you to a video call"" with a link.  No email. I was immediately triggered to see a male doctor's name. I wouldn't have accepted this appointment if I knew it was a male psychiatrist so, I checked on the appointment card. The therapist put ""Dr. [Smith]""... no first name.
--> (backstory): I'm a rape/sexual abuse and assault survivor practically half my life. So when the program director asked me, ""would you prefer to work with a male or female mental health professional?"" I said female. I felt bad for being picky but... I just knew I wouldn't feel as open/comfortable.

-We get on a video call (at this point, it's 10:45) and I immediately let him know that I told the program director I would happily wait until my providers were female only. He was taken aback after saying he wasn't informed by this, which I understood. And he said he'd call me back with some clarity. 

-After calling me back, ""emphasizing policy"", and how ""difficult it actually is to schedule an appointment as soon as I was able to"", if I can just do the initial evaluation with him and then they will advise a female psychiatrist after. I agreed as long as it meant they would make sure it was a female and I didn't mind how long it took.

-He's asking me questions, and cutting me off along the way... but what really set me off was when he asked me who referred me to their clinic. After mentioning, ""my previous therapist bc she felt, being I never been in the mental health space before, that I deserve more extensive support and care"", he asked, (dialogue below):

--

Dr.: ""what type of care did she expect you to get here?"" 

Me: ""support group, having therapist and psychiatrist all under 1 umbrella""

Dr.: ""I just don't understand what she means by ""support"". Who did you say you spoke to prior to scheduling your appointments again? 

Me: [Says program director's name]

Dr.: ""We don't know of that name (???). I just wonder what your previous therapists ""type of clientele"" is and what she expected for you in this.""

Me: ""I've never done any treatment as I said...-""

--

At this point, I'm on the verge of tears, confused, it's past 11:45 at this point/I have no idea how long this session was supposed even last, and I feel uncomfortable, so I proceeded with:
--

Me: ""--and I do want to see through other options, and decide what is the best care for me at this point.""

Dr.: ""Let me just make sure I am hearing you correctly... you don't know if you want to move forward with this clinic because, in the beginning, your expectations weren't met and you had a male psychiatrist?""

Me: ""No. That's not it.""

Dr.: ""So help me understand, please.""

So, I lost it:
Me: ""Not only that I wasn't listened to, but I told [program director] that I didn't mind waiting until a female was available, being a rape and trauma survivor.. And, now you're telling me that you have never even heard of her name.""

(As he tries cutting me off, I proceed)

""The therapist here even forgot to schedule me in last week; I had to call her. Our appointment today was over 30 minutes behind schedule. I don't know the appropriate jargon to use for my circumstance but I was referred here by my former therapist who clearly thought I deserved more after never being in treatment in life. And you comment on her clientele... I don't know how this all works but I just want to be in the right hands, which is very hard to tell where that is right now.""

He apologized for the comment, said he was ""thinking out loud""... I didn't accept the apology because you're a fucking psychiatrist. You're not my friend or colleague; and I don't know you enough to rationalize with anything you're saying. (Not to mention, when asking me if my feelings were covid-related or if I felt this way all my life, I shared with him that my grandma passed from covid in March. He didn't make a single comment of support, nor did my therapist). 

I haven't been able to sleep because I just feel so lost. I genuinely liked my former therapist despite only working with her a couple of months. As much as I appreciated her looking into this program for me and emphasizing the care I needed, that she couldn't give me because of the pandemic... I also felt neglected, and unworthy. And, those feelings are resurfacing. 

I don't know enough to know if I should power through the first few sessions or to walk away. I feel like I should suck it up and that I should feel lucky... while the other part of me feels like I'm being treated like shit and feel wrong for wanting more support. But, my gut feeling hasn't let me down ever, and I felt so uncomfortable.

If you made it this far, thank you for reading. If you can provide any insight into your experience/know of others' experiences, I would appreciate anything you can share. If this really isn't right and should look into other programs, please let me know. Or, if I should just continue seeing my current psychiatrist and seek a new therapist? My current psychiatrist is absolutely wonderful... she's kind, actively listening to me all the time, explaining the processes/diagnoses to me thoroughly...

72,"Please give any advice you can, my friend is suffering and can't get help ","I'll be calling my friend ""G""

G is 17, I'm 16. They were diagnosed with PTSD with psychotic features and GAD, but strongly suspect they have BPD. They have always had horrible mental health and have almost committed suicide more times than I can count. But recently it's gotten so much worse and there's a good chance they won't make it to 18 (in around 10 months). G has gotten so much closer to suicide and it's gotten so much more frequent, they make a plan almost every couple of days. I feel like it's about to reach a breaking point, so they can't just wait to get help anymore.

The reason for the recent severe worsening of their mental health was this subliminal. So G is very much into spirituality, and believe in subliminals, spells, stuff like that. So they listened to this ""wish subliminal"" and wished for things like a happy life, good things for all their loved ones (including me), etc. then somehow they found out that it was a bad subliminal that would actually do the opposite, and felt so guilty and scared and felt like they had to die immediately. so they almost killed themself, doing multiple subliminal flushes but still saying that they ""feel the energy of the subliminal"", and the amount of paranoia and obsession felt like an episode of delusion, which I guess sounds about right considering their diagnosis. G had dealt with what I believe was psychosis (stuff like hearing voices) before but always denied what it was.

at times when G got a little better, they did acknowledge that the subliminal thing was indeed psychosis, but they still go into cycles of belief and paranoia and subsequent suicidalness and it's getting worse. they said they couldn't feel anything besides fear for months because of it.

they have actually gone to the mental hospital a while back, it was a terrible place with staff that didn't care about the patients and prescribed the wrong medication. afterwards G went to an actual doctor and got prescribed abilify and wellbutrin, but stopped taking them because they caused more anxiety. they wanted to switch to something else, but their dad said no, and permanently disallowed any meds. from then on they had no access to medication, only therapy, but now they don't even have that.

The story behind that is that G asked their dad about going to outpatient (something their therapist begged them to do), which could've actually helped them. But their dad got extremely angry at the suggestion, and therefore made them stop therapy. So now they are getting zero help. 

Inpatient is even something G is reluctant to do, because they suggested the idea to their family and they said ""you don't need it, it's a waste of money"" andd im 99% sure their minds are unchangeable. their family is full of absolute assholes.

they can't do meds, inpatient, outpatient, or therapy, so basically they're incapable of getting help because of their family. I'm pretty much the only one G can talk to about this stuff now. and from everything they've told me, it doesn't look like they're gonna live much longer if things keep going the way they are.

I moved out of their state so our friendship is exclusively online now, so I can't do much except be there for them to talk to really, and that doesn't seem to help much. and their parents despise me, so it has to all be hidden.

if there's any advice you can think of that I can maybe relay to them, no matter how small, please, please tell me. whether it's ways to get better or even just ways to tread water until they turn 18 and can get their own treatment, I really need advice. I'm not interested in losing a friend but I don't know what to do and neither do they.

tl;dr my friend won't turn 18 for another 10 months and is extremely suicidal and suffering a lot because of their psychosis but isn't allowed to get help because of their asshole family (meds, inpatient, outpatient, therapy, nothing). any advice for how to survive the next 10 months would be appreciated, because they likely will not survive this.",1716402727.0,False,1,0,Mean-Ball-8758,None,1cy7kwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cy7kwg/please_give_any_advice_you_can_my_friend_is/

88,Why does the mental health system have to be so fucking hard to navigate if you have anything other than depression or anxiety?,"The amount of self advocacy needed to even get the right treatment is fucking ridiculous. Even just getting a proper diagnosis is an uphill battle. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety for years, but I had so many other symptoms that weren't explained by my depression or anxiety, and it was making my life fucking miserable because I wasn't getting any treatment for anything other than depression and anxiety. I felt completely hopeless because I was seeing a therapist who I was being completely honest with and taking my medication, but I still felt fucking horrible. I felt like I was doing everything I was supposed to do to get better but none of it was working. This made me extremely suicidal and my therapist ended up having me committed. I honestly though that I'd finally get a proper diagnosis there, but instead I got discharged the next day. Then my therapist referred me to an intensive outpatient program. At first I hated being there because it brought up a bunch of past trauma and that made me feel even more suicidal. It was at this point that I finally confronted my therapist during our next appointment and told her that I'm pretty sure I have something other than just depression and anxiety. I told her that I thought I had PTSD, and I told her about the flashbacks and the intense nightmares that I've been having for years, and I finally got an official diagnosis. It felt like a relief to finally have what I had been going through validated, but at the same time I felt angry because I had talked about these things in the past and nothing came of it. But whatever relief I felt was pretty short lived once I realized that I still had other symptoms that couldn't be explained by my diagnosis, and this realization made me feel hopeless again, because just when I thought that I had finally found the missing piece to my puzzle, I find out that I was missing more than just one piece. I don't even know why, but I decided to talk to the therapist at my uni and tell him about having been diagnosed with PTSD, and he asked me some questions and I said that I had been going to an intensive outpatient program 10 hours a week. He said that it was strange that I had been referred to one at the time when I had been diagnosed with only depression and anxiety. He mentioned that they're usually for people with personality disorders, and at that point I was just very confused. Since I was seeing my psychiatrist the next day I decided to bring this up, and she ended up testing me for borderline personality disorder and it turned out I had it. She then sent out an application for me for a DBT group to go to once I finished the intensive outpatient program. I sobbed because of how scared I was of this diagnosis, but the more she described it, the more sense it made that I actually had it. Getting properly diagnosed felt like I finally had a full explanation for all the horrible things I'd been feeling for years, and I could finally get the proper treatment I needed to actually get better. I just hate that I had to go through all of this just to get diagnosed correctly so that I could finally get treatment that would actually help me.

90,First Post. Is my mom right to suggest I go to mental health inpatient for a thyroid issue?,"Hello. I have been going through it with the anxiety a bit the past year. Had 2 panic attacks. A bit moody. Have been seeing a psychiatrist and taking Remeron for about 6 months. And my doctor just ordered bloodwork. Just found out 2 days ago that I have hyperthyroidism. Which can cause anxiety/mood swings. So I texted my mom and my brothers, ""just got blood work done.  I have hyperthyroidism."" Nothing more in the messages. Both of my brothers responded similarly, within an hour, saying, that sucks, hope it is the best possible outcome, love you, let me know if you wanna talk, you're so strong, etc.
My mom on the other hand, did not respond for 2 days. And just now texted me saying, ""This explains some of the mental health things. I feel like an inpatient mental health stay may help you with medication to treat both your physical and mental health symptoms. We love you so much and want you to be healthy and mentally well. Let me know if I can help facilitate getting you help."" 
I have been researching hyperthyroidism non-stop the past 2 days, and heard nothing about inpatient mental health care as a treatment. I was happy to see that maybe we finally found out what was causing my anxiety. My mom's response struck me as weird. And she was just shaming the hell out of me for taking medication. And shaming the hell out of her friend who is doing outpatient mental health for depression. She was telling me about her friend and was all ""bless her heart, she just wants to color? Coloring books at an outpatient facility? Like literally?"" So it makes me feel weird. She definitely shames people for getting mental health help and has to me in the past.

91,Worried about how a mental health crisis could affect my already fragile financial situation,"I'm sorry if this is outside the purview of typical posts here; but I am genuinely worried and a bit curious (and my question is more related to outpatient billing processes and the law, more than mental health itself; but I really didn't know which community would be appropriate to ask something like this).

Here's the background: over the last 24 hours, I've felt very close to a mental break (I'm fine right now, but going in and out), and I have considered going to the hospital if things get too out of hand for me. I believe it's mostly stress-related; as I have recently moved over 800 miles (back in with my mom, which is semi-related) after being laid off from my job in April.

So here's the issue, and my question. As I have been diligently seeking work to no avail (this job market is ass, especially in my chosen industry 😒) I am both extremely hard-up for cash and uninsured. I am also in America, the only 'modern' superpower with no universal healthcare (woohoo Freedomland!!!!! MURICA FUCK YEAH USA! USA! USA! 💥🇺🇸🇺🇸. <- that's sarcastic, I fuckin' hate it here 😔).

So my actual questions are: can I show up to the emergency room and expect to be treated, even if I refuse to identify myself? I guess I'm sort of asking about how the billing process works. I've only ever been to outpatient for mental health once and I don't really remember the process (it was 6 years ago in a different state). But I'm thinking if I just show up without my ID and provide false credentials then they won't be able to figure out who I am to properly bill; but would still be obligated to provide treatment (because of Hippocratic Oath and all that). Is this accurate and could I be charged with a crime for doing this?

92,i don't know how to handle my diagnoses anymore,"Hi hi I am new to reddit and I'm not really sure how to format a post and I might regret posting here but here I am and here we go.

Since I was a kid I was in and out of therapy due to childhood trauma (including 3-4 deaths in the family and abandonment in the span of a year) and due to my emotional issues. When I was around 8-9 I started in group therapy and I don't remember much of it, just that it was a part of  my mental health journey. I'm not sure when or why I ended group therapy but I started individual therapy around 14 years old because of anxiety and depression and, again I'm not sure when or why I stopped seeing my therapist but I remember her being awesome.

I started individual therapy again with a new therapist and I started seeing a psychiatrist as well around 16-17 years old. I feel like my mental health journey has been so long and I've only made very little progress. For years I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and/or BPD and no doctor explained it could be a comorbid diagnosis until I was about 20. I am 24 now and I've been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, bipolar 1, borderline personality disorder (BPD), CPTSD and OCD.

I feel like I've hit a wall with my progress and I have no clue how to move forward and accept these diagnoses. I've been on so many different meds and I've gotten genetic testing as well to see what medicines will work but nothing seems to work anymore. I've been in inpatient treatment, intensive outpatient treatment and standard outpatient treatment. I've tried CBT and DBT and my coping skills only work so much when I'm in a shitty home situation.

I always ask myself what I did to deserve this life and I get told that it makes me ""me"" but why does my suffering make me ""me"". Why can't I be normal and happy?

It's probably worth mentioning that I'm in Europe so it's a little different, providers aren't under pressure to give out diagnoses for insurance.

I do have an ADHD one which is good but I feel like it's just a tiny piece of the puzzle and explains next to nothing. My current psychiatrist is the first provider who seems to actually be looking for answers. He reffered me to an ASD assessment which is still ongoing but I haven't seen him in a while due to being in outpatient. He's also the one who got me into this program which I'm very grateful for because if it wasn't for that I would not have graduated high school but that's a different story. 

And yet, in the outpatient they're so passive, seemingly not looking for answers at all. Granted, I've been there only a few months but you'd think they'd be helpful in that regard. To give an example, I wanted to show my therapist two questionnaires I'd filled out about hypervigilance and cptsd. It was mostly exploratory but it's clearly something worth looking into, I wouldn't have mentioned it otherwise after all. So I showed it to my therapist but she didn't even want to look at it saying she's not a clinical psychologist and she's mainly interested in how I feel about the results.

Raised by a grandiose narcissist mother like the classic obvious type, knows everything about everything, cheater, shopping addiction, grandiose ideas and so on. Married young, now add 20 plus ish years onto that and we arrive closer to present day. Spouse had a psychotic break last year at which time it becomes clear as day that she is q covert narc.

Sometimes I actually think I have it all under control. What I'm actually realizing (from getting super frustrated with my own lack of mental health healing) is that I'm just constantly walking on egg shells altering my own true self in the hopes of keeping it all together. 

I guess what I'm asking is this, is it possible to heal myself in an environment where the other adult in this relationship is severely mentally maladjusted? It's hard because thru my own mental health work I've heard over and over and come to intimately learn that other people's mental health isn't my responsibility and that I am only responsible for me so it gets confusing to me.

When I was 22 I was admitted into inpatient due to suicidal thoughts/ideations. Truthfully I needed to be there or else I wouldn’t be here now. I was diagnosed with PTSD, major depressive disorder, anxiety/panic attack disorder, and attention deficit disorder. After getting out of inpatient I went into a two week outpatient program and had the most amazing therapist and psychiatrist, I really felt like I was on the right track and getting better. After leaving the program I was seeing a new team which wasn’t a great transition. I, admit stupidly, stopped seeing any professionals after a week of leaving treatment due to feeling great and because of family (parents don’t believe in mental health). I realize it was a mistake because I found myself in a pattern of depression episodes and overall struggling with life. I’ve tried to go back but then the cycle repeats… I want to get help I need to get better. I get I really just want help in what are my next steps?

112,Spouse in emergency room for suicidal thoughts.,"Follow up after 4 days:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you all for the replies.  Late that first night there was nobody helpful at the hospital to talk to and I couldn't figure out a google search to get anything useful. Here's an update:

The facility they transferred her to after the ER is an impatient behavioral health department at another hospital. She called me from the facility phone early Wednesday morning (before I read these replies) and told me where she was, but they hadn't even explained anything to her so we were still both clueless. I called the hospital and they wouldn't tell me anything--they hadn't given her the consent form to sign. I had to wait for her to call back to let her know, but in the next 24 hours there was no call. She had been so over-medicated that she was knocked out the entire day and woke up after 10pm when phone privileges ended. Thursday morning she called and told me they had to adjust her meds because she couldn't stay awake. She sounded like a sleepy zombie. She was able to sign the consent form and I then got a call from her assigned social worker who wanted to confirm that I'd pick her up once she was discharged. They told me it would typically be in 5-7 days, with an outpatient program to follow. No info on treatment plan or anything else. I dropped off clothes and a book that same day but am not allowed to visit.

I've at least been able to talk to her a couple times daily. This morning (Saturday) her doctor told her she would be discharged on Monday, but we don't know if he's actually ordered the discharge. The social worker hasn't called me back, so I'll have to call again Sunday if I still don't hear anything.

They've already added a day to her stay due to the change in medication, so I don't even want to say anything about how over-medicated she still is for fear that they'll screw it up worse and for longer. I really just want her released so we can get her to a competent doctor in the outpatient program. Just one more day, I hope.

**Edit2: If you have had emergency room experience, PLEASE share. I don't know how any of this works**

Last night my wife went into the ER on her own and told them she was having suicidal thoughts. They took away her phone, gave her a medical check, and then said they're transferring her to another facility. (We're in the US - Illinois)

**What now? Can I trust the system to get her the support she needs?  What kind of facility might they send her to?**

~~I feel like there's nobody to advocate for her. As the husband, they treat me as a potential danger, which I understand is meant to protect her, but I feel useless while like she's stuck in the hospital with no autonomy. What can I do?~~
*Removing because it's apparently distracting from my primary question*

Edit:
To clarify, they did let me see her after a couple hours after she insisted. She's not getting any treatment yet besides something for anxiety. 
It's an emergency department and all they do is provide medical treatment and a 24 hour sitter to make sure she doesn't hurt herself. 
They don't know where she'll get transferred and I just want to make sure she's taken care of appropriately. I just don't know yet if we even get any say on where she goes. I don't want her to get pushed around in the system, but I don't even understand how any of this works.",1637149424.0,False,130,65,Cold-Shallot-2947,None,qvxhqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/qvxhqd/spouse_in_emergency_room_for_suicidal_thoughts/

i’ve seen 9 therapists and 6 psychiatrists, and done 2 outpatient programs.

i’m going into residential soon, i’ll be there for a month. i had ~3 years where it was looking like things might be okay. now i’m back in a place where i need serious help. i’m scared and not scared, because i have faith in the treatment program and the providers and myself. i know that whatever happens, unless i go in and they turn out to be literally evil (and i have good reason to believe that they aren’t), i will come out the end of this month stronger, more stable, more secure, and better prepared. i know this but also i’m scared because of the 10 years and 9 therapists and 6 psychiatrists and 2 outpatient programs. and i’m scared of the paper they sent me that says they prescribe ketamine, tms, and ect. idk enough about ketamine but i don’t want anybody touching my fucking brain, please do not bother talking to me about it.

Despite lots of treatment and control of panic attacks with heavy meds I’m in general still terrified of public transport , public places , having no quick escape route in said situations, even just going outside to take out the trash. With meds I do it but I’m still scared. I think about it constantly. I want to push for diagnosis if it’s possible because I want to know if it’s considered a phobia or if my anxiety just isn’t being treated well enough. How do I approach asking for an evaluation for agoraphobia - I fear offending my doctor or undermining somehow? Idk it probably wouldn’t… but if it did? I’m scared to be dismissed again. I’ve mentioned it briefly before but it didn’t lead to an evaluation.

132,"My Thought Loop feels like a Problem that Needs to be Solved, do I Ignore or Solve?","For a while now (two years eight months) I've had mental health problems. It started very suddenly in September of 2020 for what I assume was me lagging behind on schoolwork because I walked into the lions' den by starting to play video games during breaks, which then little by little grew until I was faced with more assignments than I was used to (in retrospect it was only like 3 late ones which to me feels pathetic now lol but it was so overwhelming at the time that I avoided it and it grew exponentially). Ever since that relatively small event I felt like there was something wrong with me, like something clicked. 

I searched and searched until very recently I became self aware that there wasn't really ever a problem, or at least I think so. SSRI's didn't do anything and I never presented real symptoms of chronic depression or anxiety and only had these cursory anxious feelings that felt like they came from a bigger source (diagnosed with MDD and GAD for some reason). Now I'm pretty sure these  issues have grown into an obsessive thought loop, which may be OCD, as my new psychiatrist prescribed me new meds for it but it's not diagnosed yet so I won't say I have it. I constantly have a recurring thought of this weird mental image of the past, but nothing in particular. Almost like I pause time and ask myself ""Am I good?"" constantly. This mental image of a static timeline and concrete past nearly instantly spikes my heart rate and my heart flutters, so clearly there is a subconscious fear of something, most likely failure.

Now that we have a background, I'd like to ask, should I ""ignore"" the problem by widdling away the thought loop until it's gone, or try to tackle it head on like I've tried for so long to no avail? For the former it feels more realistic and sensible but the latter idea gnaws away at me, the idea of it just being fixed. I know it's possible for it to completely go away since I've never really had symptoms of any mental illness before September 2020, but I'm not sure about my path. I was an IOP for a while because I was so immersed in thought I didn't want to go to school, so outpatient was just a good temporary alternative, but I returned recently and will be seeing my normal outpatient provider tomorrow just so y'all don't ask me to get a therapist (I know it's good intentions tho).

133,Feeling lost - husband going to inpatient facility,"My husband is an alcoholic. He had ten months of sobriety until 6/30/23, and it’s been so rocky ever since. On September 7th, our almost seven year old daughter got diagnosed with cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy. Today, my husband tried to hurl himself off a bridge. He was taken to our local hospital to let him sober up, and I filled out paperwork to have him involuntarily held and sent somewhere that he can get help, and was waiting for a phone call that I hoped I wouldn’t get, but got it. The commissioner for mental health treatment and a public defender talked with my husband and presented him with my petition, and offered him to go willingly, and he declined and wanted to do an intensive outpatient addiction treatment three days a week instead. Since he declined inpatient treatment, they called me and we had a hearing and ultimately after hearing everything and knowing what happened today, or what almost happened today, the commissioner is sending him to an inpatient facility to get himself straightened around. His defender was going to let me talk to my husband after the hearing ended, but my husband refused and it broke my heart. I gave him a little bit to cool off, and called the hospital directly to speak with him and he refused to speak to me again. Idk what to do.

135,Residential Treatment Center Recommendations?,"Hello folks! I'm in a terrible place in my life right now after having been kicked out of my stable nesting housing (11 years with friends) and going through a divorce where I'm the one being dumped in 2023. I had done a partial outpatient program in my city (2 weeks of ACT and DBT) and it helped for a bit, but then during my birthday this year I just totally collapsed and needed to be inpatiented at a ward for 48 hours.  
My therapist of several years, who I trust a lot, said it's time to look at inpatient residential programs across the US so I can be fully supported. We're looking for ones that take a BCBS insurance plan (can't afford self-pay). Also, I'm trans, so I'd want to go somewhere in a safe state or a place known to be very LGBT friendly. I'm an adult, so I need adult programs. What's going on with me seems to be a mix of depression caused by abandonment issues from childhood trauma (so: cptsd). I do not have any substance disorders so places that focus on that aren't right.

140,"I take every single thing I've been told in therapy seriously, and I don't know how to disregard what therapists say. When I get conflicting advice in therapy from what I learned in therapy years ago, I can't process it.","FWIW, I've been told I have a very rigid thought process and have been diagnosed with Asperger's as a child (though it was never addressed and the diagnosis has since been dismissed numerous times). I also do not know how to form my own views and opinions based on things I'm told and things I read - everything is taken in its entirety or completely dismissed. None of my therapists have seen this as an issue and therefore I have nowhere to turn for help with it.

I've been in DBT, a residential treatment center, intensive outpatient, AA, and outpatient therapy. Because I've dealt with abusive family members completely dismissing anything a therapist told them that they didn't like, I feel like I have to take everything seriously, otherwise I'm wasting both of our time and not willing to get better. Unfortunately, I don't filter ANYTHING and that means I have to process what I heard in therapy for MONTHS. Whenever I attempt balancing what I've learned in multiple places, it doesn't work because I'm still giving ideas value that I probably should drop. 

DBT says that volunteering is a way to build positive experiences and self-image. Intensive outpatient said volunteering is a form of narcissism because we do it to feel good about ourselves, and is therefore not healthy.

Residential treatment taught me that participation by listening is a healthy boundary when you're too tired or not in a good mood. Intensive outpatient says this is selfish and if you're choosing to be in group therapy, your peers are entitled to your feedback. Outpatient therapist says some things aren't even worthy of a response in the first place.

DBT taught me how to get my needs met by setting boundaries, since most relationships with people we have issues with need to stay in our lives (bosses, parents). Residential taught me that no, you actually don't need to have those people in your life - quitting your job and cutting off your parents IS an acceptable boundary. Intensive outpatient took it a step further and said that if you don't do this, you're choosing to stay stuck.

Residential and DBT talked about how it's okay to slip up, acknowledge what you did wrong, forgive yourself, and move forward. AA equated self-forgiveness with a lack of accountability - if you slip up once, you're back at square 1.

My IOP facility in particular set me back several notches - I had only just gained a shred of self esteem at residential when a therapist (note: not MY therapist) told me I had antisocial personality disorder in group therapy and lead a psychoeducation group on how to get your needs met by ""a person like me."" I do feel like some of it was helpful, though. I wound up asking my friends if they thought I was selfish and every single one said I was either selfish or inconsiderate. Since I went there, my relationships and friendships are 10x better - but I don't know how to let go of the toxic shit I was fed there without also letting go of what's helpful.

141,What to do when even the ss hotline gives up?,"(Obligatory sorry for doing this wrong- I don't really use reddit but I'm desperate for help)

Also tw for talk of suicidal thoughts and basically everything along those lines.

My mother suffers from depression, anxiety, OCD, and a number of other issues, as well as recently several physical health complications, a minor stroke last year, and an eating disorder that has escalated exponentially. Combined with a lot of poverty-driven issues and just terrible luck, she's not in a good place in life. I'm trying to find her a better (safer) place to live, closer to family, but in the meantime, she has been going downhill fast.  As of the past week she's hit what I would say is rock bottom. She has said to me explicitly that she wants to die, and that she doesn't have enough of her medication to 'do the job'. She is also so physically weak from not eating for days and days on end, not moving... she's in very rough shape. 

(She did recently collapse and was taken to the hospital. They gave her fluids, got some food in her, and sent her home.)

I have tried to convince her to go to a mental health facility for help, but it's like I've hit a wall. She is on medicare and medicaid, and every single place I call is a dead end. Most places will prescribe her antidepressants or other meds, but none will do actual therapy. (She's tried about every med there is over her lifetime, to the point that she's basically given up hope any will work. She currently has a prescription and just hasn't been taking it.) 

In terms of outpatient therapy, I can't find anyone in the area that will take her. In terms of inpatient therapy, I am having a hard time finding anything, and also having a hard time convincing her that she will be okay there. (She has had some bad experiences at psych hospitals and has gotten to the point that she is terrified of them and imagining the absolute worst)

Anyway.

It escalated to the point last friday that I called to have her Baker Acted (It's a florida law that allows family/loved ones to basically have someone detained and taken to a mental health facility for their own safety.)  The police went to her place, but she didn't meet their ""criteria"" for needing to be taken. (She assured them she was fine and that if she needed anything she would call right away, which is all 100% a lie. She's just so so scared of going to a psych ward that she'd tell them anything to get out of it.)

I have been researching and calling everyone under the sun- assisted living facilities, nursing homes, inpatient, outpatient, anyone I can think of. It all comes down to ""we don't take medicaid/medicare"" or ""she doesn't qualify because she can still breathe"" or ""she can go on the wait list""

At one point over the weekend I even contacted the suicide hotline. They weren't able to offer anything more than ""Baker act her, good luck.""

\--  
I am fully at a loss for what to do. When I talk to her she answers in one or two words, monotone and empty. When I try to get her to agree to anything that would help, she just repeats, ""You don't understand,"" and ""It won't help"". Today I told her I was going to make her an appt for therapy, and her neighbor is willing to drive her. I started calling around, only to get a bunch more ""sorry, can't help"" and ""even though our site says we take medicaid we actually only take it for this very specific thing that is not what you need""

I don't know what to do. I don't know where to look next or how to help her. 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. She is in Marion County, Florida. As far as I know I've called every facility within a hundred miles, but maybe there's something I missed. 

Maybe not- maybe there's nothing to help her, but I'm going to keep trying until the end.

142,I’m about to be manic,"I (21F) have been officially diagnosed with bpd and bipolar II for about 1.5 years, but have been dealing with them unknowingly for about 6 years.

My diagnosis was tricky to get, because 80% of the time, I swing depressed not manic; if I was manic, I took far longer for the episode to become apparent.  While finally on meds that are tailored to my genome and condition, I tend to average some kind of manic episode every 3-4 months. Almost on clockwork.  It can range from staying up until 4am reorganizing my room, to me being sent to an outpatient partial hospitalization program for a month.  

I’ve been good.  My last episode was sometime in the summer of 2023 and even that was fairly mild. 

But I can feel it.  It’s building, and it’s coming, and I’m scared. 

The signs were mild at first: eating only 20% of my food during my 8 hour shift, or simply zoning out at the dinner table. 

But now I’m dissociating, my hunger is meager and ends with me sick in the bathroom.  I feel lost, completely unsatisfied with the life I was content with just three days ago.  I want to do something reckless.  But I know I won’t. And it will end with me shaking in my room because my racing thoughts won’t cease and yet I’m aware enough to not act on my more serious impulses. 

And then I will be depressed.  Because it always comes after the mania, a raging cloud that will hang over my head for weeks if not months.

146,I wish on his downfall so I’ll feel better.,"Warning: ✨long✨ post

Hi! I have a lot going on right now, so I just wanted to share so I feel a bit more valid and stop thinking that I’m being dramatic. Early January I broke up with my boyfriend of six months, which doesn’t seem like a lot, but I’d only ever had two month relationships before, so I consider it a lot. I broke up with him because I honestly just hated everything he did, and was generally annoyed whenever he showed affection or that he was worried about me, so I pushed him away (along with the rest of my social circle,) and eventually cut it off after some contemplation. For reference I was already struggling a bit with school and passing my classes, finding joy in my hobbies, or feeling anything other than anger really. The only things I’d do was occasionally come to school and go to work. Other than that it was sleep. 

 Fast forward a bit, I’d like to think I’m doing fine with the breakup, I’m the one who initiated it, but I’m not. I realized that all of my friends only liked me for him, and that none of them would choose to be around me out of the two of us. So when I was already struggling to go to school, I started going even less because all of my social life was gone in majority of my classes since he was there. This led to me being really irritable and snapping at teachers, peers, and friends alike. This went on for two weeks before I said fuck it and wrote a long note about everything Im thinking about (lots of insults to my ex, our friends, how I hate him but I cant help but say I love him, want to kill myself, I self harm all the time, dont sleep for multiple days then oversleep, lack of appetite, ect.) 

I showed my mom the note after my ex told the school consular who contacted my mom, so I just asked her if I should be 100% honest and she said yes. This led to a fun little ER trip where I stayed there for 4 hours before they decided to put me in outpatient at a mental hospital (four classes, two group therapy sessions, rec and lunch.) It’s been a week since I first arrived, and I finally made some friends, so the 8 hours at the hospital itself isnt bad, I’m just so bored and numb whenever I have free time.

 Except when I text my ex, he’s the only one I talked to about going to outpatient school, and he’s proud and yada yada. He’s my only source of happiness, or whatever you’d call that emotion that isnt just existing. I know its not healthy having one source of joy, but I cant let him go or I’ll go back to being suicidal and just existing. I still self harm 3-4 times a week, but I dont want to die, so that’s improvement? I only think about cutting off contact and isolating myself because I’ll say I hate him, then take it all back. Blame him for everything, then feel guilty and think that I have a victim complex. The nail in the coffin is that I think about ruining his social life, exposing his depression to his family, ect. So he’ll try killing himself and end up in the mental hospital with me. I know its wrong, and I think about blocking him because of these thoughts. Yet I dont because I’m selfish and want to be happy, even at his expense. I don’t know if I love him or if I’m just obsessed because I’m lonely and cut everyone else out of my life. It doesnt help that I’m completely honest with him about all of this, and he still continues talking to me regularly and interacts with me more because of it. He’s not manipulating me or anything, lovebombing or whatever, he’s just so genuinely dumb in love that he refuses to comprehend I am toxic. Its fucked up to leave it up to him to cut me off, but I’m honestly not selfless enough to do it on my end. Im not sure if I’m feeling guilty, or if I just know what I’m thinking is wrong because of how I was raised. 

I dont even know why I’m so obsessed, I think I am just lonely and its not him personally. He’s actually the opposite of what I look for in a relationship; hes nice, considerate, patient, all that stuff. I typically look for someone I’ll be in constant fight or flight with, arguments, adrenaline, frankly, I want someone abusive. I think it’d be nice to know what I’m feeling, fear, pain, anxiety, all the negative edgy shit. I love pain, inflicting it on others and myself, and I’d say I’m quite the adrenaline junkie, so I honestly have no goddamn clue why my whole mood depends on this man who’s the complete opposite. 

I’ve gone to mandated therapy for a couple sessions before, but nothing more than that mental health wise. I have periods of self isolation and have since I was probably 14 (currently 18,) along with self harm and emotional numbness, plus not comprehending what I’m feeling like ever. The only things that make me feel better are dressing cute, talking to him, and the mango loco monster (only that one for whatever reason.) It just hasn’t really struck me as an issue until now, since I’m more than willing to hurt the one person who deeply cares about me. I’m hoping to get a diagnosis out of my time at outpatient, since my dad has bipolar, and my sisters with a non-concrete diagnosis for either depression and anxiety or bipolar as well.

148,Scared of losing my brother,"I am 16 my brother is 10, and I love him more than anything in this world.

Some background: I had a friend in 8th grade who committed suicide at age 13, and we all knew his older brother. For some reason, after that happened I have been afraid that I will end up like the older brother. Additionally, I was with my friend at lunch the day he died, and have always felt heavy guilt for not reading signs, or texting him, even though I was only 13 and struggling myself. 

My brother was put in a hospital last year for suicidal tendencies, when he was 9, because of his school. It was a mess for my family, because we are all so close. Some things that he said will haunt me forever and I can't believe my baby brother felt like that. He was at a hospital miles away from us for like 3 days, it was horrible.
Finally, I have been inpatient and outpatient many times for suicidal ideation and self harm since the age of 14, and when this happened I had just finished an intensive outpatient program. I was still severely depressed at this point and rarely attending school.

So with these 3 things combined, I feel like I am overly protective of my brother. I am so scared that I will just lose him like my friends brother lost him. Knowing how close I've come to killing myself, I relate and am terrified that he will try again. This makes no sense though, because he changed schools and went through therapy and he is doing great now, living that 10 year old life. But I feel like I'm scared to leave him alone sometimes. 

I feel like I have to check on him all the time, especially before I go to bed , or after he gets really angry. My biggest fear is that I will find him and he won't be alive. Even though he is doing so much better now, I love him to death and I think my past experiences have scarred me so much that I just irrationally act this protective. I know he is okay, but sometimes I feel overwhelming fear. 

Is it normal?

I'm 24/M & severely depressed & anxiety since age 7 & have managed it like shit.

Anyways I've been going through some of the worst times mentally for me & finally decided to get some help, one of my mother's close friends works for an outpatient group therapy center and had told me how to get in because they required a referral. I was told to go to the ER and ask for a psych evaluation where I'd talk to a doc get a referral to the outpatient place & then I could start doing therapy. When I went to the ER i went with my mother and we were placed in the middle of an extremely busy ER with never getting put into a private room. a few doctors loudly and very uncomfortably berate me about wanting to kill myself (which I never stated I did only that I wish I wasn't here which obviously was the wrong thing to express even though it's true). I was then told to change close because we had arrived at 4pm the main psych. wasn't there so they told me they'd put me in a hospital room and spend ONE night to talk to the doctor in the morning. Not only did they tell me this they also stated the EXACT SAME THING to my Mother. Nope blatant lie. I was locked in the looney bin for 5 days with zero results.

I’m currently only taking lamotrigine and Wellbutrin, prescribed by the last psychiatrist I saw years ago when I was only 18. I do think it helps mood regulation some but she said she believed I was on the spectrum of bipolar disorder with my symptoms, which I and every therapist I’ve seen since has completely disagreed with. I wasn’t knowledgeable at that point but she refused to listen when I explained I thought the “bipolar symptoms” resulted from childhood trauma, not necessarily a chemical imbalance like with bipolar disorder. I definitely have never even experienced mania, really just have done impulsive things when I was a teenager which I’ve grown out of a lot. I’m only really impulsive now in a self destructive and private way, not shoplifting and shit like I was doing at 18 and saw the psychiatrist. I’ve never been formally diagnosed but the therapist I saw the longest did say she thinks my symptoms came from my childhood trauma and living in a toxic environment for so long and also suspected ADHD. It’s just so complex and confusing, at this point I think I have OCD, social anxiety, most likely BPD or CPTSD, regular ole PTSD lol, very possibly ADHD, and a lot of things that I’m sure are a result of the co-occurring disorders such as skin picking, binge eating, substance abuse, depression, paranoia, and derealization, depersonalization, and dissociation.

I'd say her anxiety is debilitating at this point since she stays inside the house every single day, doesn't go to school(she does online home study), and can't even go out to the store like Target. She does have a desire to go out and make friends and was supposed to go back to school in person this semester but she just couldn't do it. My parents are so lost and seem to have given up on trying to help her. My mom especially has just kinda accepted that this is how she is and doesn't make many attempts to get help for her. She was seen by a psychiatrist within the last 12 months and was diagnosed with ADHD and given medication for that but she stopped going to therapy and taking her medication. I'm not sure if her anxiety was even addressed. I really want to help my sister but it's difficult for me to be too involved because I'm a young single mom and currently in nursing school so my plate is a bit full at the moment. I thought my sister might benefit from an outpatient program for teens, which I mentioned to our mother but she hasn't done anything to look for one. Does anyone have advice on where my sister can get good quality help? I know she wants to get better she just needs support and some kind of intensive therapy.

Everything from feeling emotions, dealing with withdrawals, depression, anxiety and lonliness from cutting myself out of all past invovlement in that world, and ending all of the friendships I had made through that life to better myself and have a real go at a positive future.

However, I only have my online mates to communicate with that I made through gaming before I ended up in the drug scene, and the couple of people I have become friends with through the outpatient rehab program I'm attending 3 times a week. But I just find myself feeling lonely constantly at home as I'm stuck on Home Detention for the foreseeable future, and even though I have my parents and brother at home, I'm still struggling with feelings of depression and lonliness due to a lack of real friendships and social interaction.

I'm just wondering if anyone on reddit is or has gone through similar experiences themselves and if anyone has any advice that might help me get through this and overcome these feelings.

I exercise regularly, eat good food and see councellors as well as attend an outpatient rehab program already, but any advice would be welcomed.",1623568527.0,False,2,4,InfamousNTays,None,nyqzqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/nyqzqu/anyone_got_advice_struggling_with_my_mental_health/

179,[Discussion - stigma] What term do you guys feel is least stigmatizing for an inpatient facility?,"I see a lot of redditors use the term ""mental hospital"" which I feel is a bit fetishistic and stigmatizing. In conversation, I usually just say ""a psych unit"" or even ""a unit,"" and in my smaller communities I will use shorthand for specific units at local hospitals (ie, ""5 north""). But in less familiar settings, I'll say ""a psychiatric facility"" or ""a psych hospital,"" which strikes me as less stigmatizing, and I'm curious if you feel the same way. There's just something about the term ""mental hospital"" that makes me feel like shit about myself.

I've been inpatient 13 or 14 times, and I've done day treatment at a few hospitals which I call ""outpatient"" as opposed to calling weekly sessions with my therapist of 5 years ""outpatient.""

182,How I(19M) overcame my pillbox,"Throwaway so that this doesn't somehow get to my friends.

So I (19M) have recently been.admitted to a psychiatric hospital. During my stay there I have amassed quite a lot of pills I need to take every single day - shocking to anyone, but especially me who has never seen a therapist before this. I still go to the hospital as an outpatient every day for therapy groups and checkup, and so when I once saw my psychologist and told her I often forget to take my medication, especially when I feel bad, she suggested a pillbox.
For the first few weeks, I absolutely hated it. I felt sad and broken every time I thought about that box, to the extent that I was almost re-admitted for overnight stays at the hospital.
I knew I had to find a solution. Then one day while doing the groceries I saw a box of Mike & Ikes, and a lightbulb just popped above my had. I now put a jellybean or M&M in every day of my pill box, and it helps me feel like I'm in control of medication, not the other way around.

Subsequently I contacted my doctor assuming that it was time for me to get on some medication but had an awful reaction to the SNRI for the first 2 days and stopped taking it. 2 days later I stopped sleeping, and didn’t get more than 6 hours total for the next 2 weeks. I was prescribed multiple sleeping meds that never worked and I ended up in a crisis center (no psychosis, just pure panic about getting it) and put on 10mg Olanazpine/Zyprexa. I was there for 3 days never getting any more sleep. Once I left I lowered my dose to 5mg for the next 3 days and still had no sleep but felt completely zombified. I checked into my outpatient appointment and informed them I still wasn’t sleeping and the dose was way to high so they lowered it to 2.5. I spent 8 days at this and got sleep. Eventually I decided it was way to brain warping and cut again to 1.87mg for 5 days, then 1.25 for 6 days. I scheduled with a doctor and she advised me that I could stop taking it but after hearing horror stories on here I was scared. I took 3 days at .625mg and now on day 2 at 0.

186,"In IOP, and it’s not helping","I’ve been in IOP once before when I was in 5th grade, it supposedly helped, mainly because I didn’t need the help they thought I did.

Now I’m back in it again, I tried getting into inpatient but because I didn’t express I was suicidal at the time, I was put into the least urgency program, IOP, intensive outpatient.

I go there 8:30-11:30 every day, not on weekends, and at first it was helping. Then I realized the thing it was helping with wasn’t my issue, anger issues.

I’ve still been hurting myself while in the program, but apparently it’s minor enough (like only once every few weeks I act on the urges) that no one seems to care! I’ve literally expressed the fact I am suicidal (I wasn’t before, but I quickly became suicidal) and that I have all this SH urges, but whenever they ask if I plan to act on them I say no because I don’t want them telling my mom.

Mom, for context, does not want me in this program because she thinks I’ll say something wrong, CPS will be called, and I’ll be taken away. She only gets mad at me instead of comforts me if I have negative thoughts.

I want to go inpatient, or partial, because I think they’ll help me more. But I can’t get that point across.

Another thing real quick, I got put on anti anxiety meds before and it made it worse. Then anti depressants, and it made it worse.

189,"The Junkie, his ADHD, and his Moment of Clarity","I took to self-medicating at 14, long before my ADHD diagnosis at 23. By age 19, I had already been a chronic teenage alcoholic and graduated as a seasoned meth user by age 20. After years of inpatients, outpatients, slips, and relapses, I couldn't figure out what the hell was wrong with me. I tried the 12 steps, S.M.A.R.T. Recovery, health realization, etc... over and over, to no avail. I just couldn't stay sober and tried everything before I surrendered to the idea that complete abstinence just wasn't my thing. Keep in mind that I was still undiagnosed at this point.  
Harm reduction is controversial. Some see it as swapping one bad habit out for another, while others advocate for it. I had no clue where to turn before my diagnosis, and I knew abstinence wasn't going to work. After some research, I finally found an alternative rehab that focused on co-occurring disorders as opposed to mere drug abuse. This place saved my fuckin' life, man. Most treatments will not allow clients who are taking controlled substances, despite a prescription. Not this place. Here, they acknowledge that addiction is a symptom, and they understand dopamine deficiency. Not only did they grant my overdue ADHD-HI diagnosis, but they also prescribed me the stimulant I've needed my whole life, despite my use history.  
I'm telling you, man- self-improvement began the very day I received my diagnosis and began proper medication treatment. By then, however, drugs had become a problem of its own, but it became MUCH easier to sober up over time. I've since enrolled in the medical marijuana program as well, which is another very controversial thing in the recovery world. But this, alongside my medication, has kept me off of meth and booze for 1 whole year now, my greatest milestone yet. It pisses me off to think about how much treatment I've been denied simply because of the stigma surrounding the meds I take for my well-being.

190,"""Ugliness survey"" at the hospital exacerbated my body dysmorphia","I'm a 30 year old woman. I've struggled with body dysmorphia since childhood, mostly fixating on my nose (which has a bump and is crooked, so there is what you might call a ""real"" issue) as well as a general sort of ugliness that I cannot specifically place.   


This past summer I was hospitalized for anorexia and once I was transferred from inpatient to outpatient, they enrolled me in a few group therapies. One of the nurses in the program had me email her photos of my face from different angles and distributed these photos to ten anonymous staff members at the hospital, and asked them to answer questions like, ""How ugly is this person out of 10?"" or ""How much does this person's nose ruin their face?"" and so on. We wrote the questions together.  


Before she did this exposure I expressed multiple times that I feared I would be at risk of self-harming upon seeing the results, and that I really did not want to do it. I asked if I could opt out and she said yes but continued to bring it up and ask me why I wouldn't do it until I eventually agreed.   


The results came in and were varied. A couple people rated me a ""10"" for beauty, others a ""4."" More than half said that my nose does in fact ruin my face (ratings of 6-10 out of 10).   


These results were very distressing to me, less because of the numbers themselves and more so because I felt coerced into doing the exposure and because there was no follow up or after care. The nurse read me the results, gave me the ""raw data"" and excused me from her office. This was in July, it's mid-October now, and I am still struggling with this information.  


This is of course not the ""cause"" of my dysmorphia, but I'm feeling unable to get past what feels like confirmation of my ugliness. I have trouble leaving my apartment or working while my partner is home because I fear he will look at me and see how ugly I am. It is disrupting my every day. I am in therapy with a general counsellor and also a trauma therapist, so two sessions a week, and I don't seem to be getting anywhere with the BDD. I also research it and read studies and articles about the disorder to try to better understand it. I consider myself in most ways a very reasonable, giving, dedicated person, friend, and partner, but I am so totally fixated on my ugliness sometimes that I fear I will drive others away.  


I guess I am asking two things: 1. Is there any hope for dysmorphic patients? I haven't felt like I've made any progress over the 12 or so years of therapy, and 2. Is this kind of exposure experiment normal?  


Thanks very much in advance for any insight.

You will go in feeling more worse and come out feeling more worse than you went in and extremely bored and fed up. 

A majority of people of with mental health problems barely able to leave their own homes let alone go to a group and sit and with a bunch of mindless strangers.

My husband and I deal with mental illness and self harm, and we're going through a really rough time right now. Things escalated today because of an argument and we both went into a severe crisis and it was a mess. I have to physically hold my husband down when he self harms because of the nature of it and it can get heated. Especially when I am also in crisis but I have to help him directly almost always. One of our neighbors must have gotten worried and called the police. I feel awful and like a huge burden now.

They had about 4-5 cops show up and I told them we were having a mental health crisis and I was trying to subdue myself and my husband. I told them their services would only make things worse and I wanted them to leave. One guy got right in my face and told me to shut up multiple times. I explained to him the difference in self harm and suicide and how self harm is a harm reduction technique we use to release emotion. I explained we are under doctors care and on medication and all of that. My husband has been outpatient even recently.

When he started questioning me he said ""that guy obviously has something wrong with him."" I was really shocked and was like ""my husband suffers from serious medical and behavioral illnesses and that's a really awful thing to say and very stigmatizing and not helpful"" and he rolled his eyes at me. Again I was like ""you're just going to roll your eyes when I'm trying to be real with you?""

I have bipolar 2, bpd, ocd, adhd, and c-ptsd. Last June I had a major manic episode in which I was almost in a sleep walking state and everyone found out. I left my phone sitting on top of my car with my car doors open, only gone for a couple hours. Someone called the cops when they saw it and they started calling my friends on my phone, so everyone found out. I’ve been the most depressed I’ve ever been in my life since then because of being treated differently with that mental health stigma. I don’t know how to become interested in activities anymore and how to relate to people. There’s this overall feeling of it being unpleasant and difficult to converse with others. Getting distracted constantly is definitely contributing to feelings of self-doubt getting sidetracked from job hunting. Isolating is unusual for me as I’m an extrovert, enfp to be exact. I have scheduled extensive therapy sessions multiple times a week, so I’m getting the help I need. I initially wanted to do an outpatient IOP program because I’m not suicidal, but my insurance doesn’t cover it, therefore I can’t afford it. Also down on myself because I’m unemployed due to bad health that’s improving with my arms and clotting and the programs expressed they wouldn’t be flexible with interviews throughout the 8 week program. I can’t still be unemployed on the other side of this because I’m financially struggling. Desperate here, so asking if anyone has any advice on how to get by without losing my mind in the meantime. By the way, I’m on 300 mg lamictal, 1.5 mg of resperedone, 150 of lyrica for nerve pain, pristiq for depression, and 10 mg of vyvanse for adhd.

200,TW:// Please read if you can ):,"To sum up everything, recently I have fell into a really bad depression after having bad manic episodes. I tried killing myself last friday and clearly it was unsuccessful. I ended up in the psych ward for 5 days and only got discharged early because I agreed to do an adult outpatient program (9am-3pm) in a week considering the fact that I’ll turn 18 on tuesday. I literally live in the middle of no where and the program is about 40 minutes away but my boyfriend happens to live in the same city the program is in. I asked him for a really big favor and that was if I could stay with him to do the outpatient program, because if not my mom would have to take off 3 weeks of work to take me and i would never ever hear the end of it from her. I come from a very abusive family and his family is super supportive and loving of him. I know that was asking for a lot but I know if he was struggling I would beg my family to let him stay with me and I would drop EVERYTHING to help him. But the feeling doesn’t seem to be mutual. He keeps saying like his roommate wouldn’t let him and that it’s basically just a big hassle to him. I said I could stay out as long as I can I literally just need a place to sleep at night and I’d be out every morning to leave for the program and still that wasn’t enough. I feel like I have to constantly beg him for everything. I begged him to hang out on my birthday with me and he’s like “my roommate is gonna have friends over so we can’t” and it just doesn’t make any sense anymore. I really need advice on the situation, maybe I could be wrong for being upset.

edit: I’ve offered to repay them both for letting me stay, I don’t wanna stay there for free even though he’s like my bf and stuff.

201,What should I do if I am What should I do if I am not ready to seek help but need help? not ready to seek help but need help?,"I have been struggling with my mental health for years. I tried seeking help last year and was hospitalized after that I attended a few outpatient therapy sessions and then quit. 

The reason I quit was that I developed an immense fear of going to therapy and stirring up old wounds. It got to the point I started having panic attacks days in advance, thinking about how I could kill myself before the next appointment so I wouldn't have to go. Talking about my problems in therapy was almost impossible and to this day still is very hard. 

But I can't go on like this. I know I need help or my mental health will keep deteriorating but I don't know how to help myself. I've tried educating myself, socializing more, meditation and yoga, being ""disciplined"" and just pushing through things instead of giving up and falling into another really bad depressive episode. I DO better in life but I don't FEEL better. If things keep on going like this it seems inevitable I am going to kill myself. 

Google always suggests going to therapy or your GP and talking to someone. But I can't due to my immense panic.

209,"Help, i can't make myself eat."," 

I have unconsciously done this my entire life. 

I would feel hungry but not feel like eating. 

I would therefore promise myself I would eat later, but I never did. 

I would only give myself a fruit—a banana or an apple—when I started shaking and feeling physically ill, and it is definitely insufficient to make up for going an entire day without food. 

In order to get my body to stop shaking and regain some strength, I would repeat this cycle for days by eating some fruit once a day.

 

Even though now I live alone, I still find myself doing things that. I thought I would stop doing this when I moved out on my own. It's as if my brain creates conditions for me to eat, such as: you can eat after cleaning the house, but that's pointless, and since eating has never been a reward for doing anything for me, it makes me even less interested in doing those things.

210,22 Yr Old Son refuses to work and depressed.,"Adult son will not leave home and refuses to work.

Our  22 year old son currently lives in our basement.  He will not find a job,  and  refuses to do any work around the house.  He says he  needs inpatient mental health treatment for depression, and without this he will not be able to get a job or do any type of chores around the house.  He dropped out of school his first semester in college fall of 2020, and has been working jobs on and off since.  He cannot keep a job typically for more than 2 days.  He was in extensive inpatient/outpatient therapy for a stint about 2 years ago. He now supposedly is seeing a therapist.  As parents we are struggling with his behavior.

1. He lies: when money is needed he lies.  He needs gas for a job interview.  The gas money is then spent on vape . Beer. And energy drinks.  Does this with therapy money as well.. basically he will use any excuse he can find for money.  We are now to a point where we don’t believe him.. and cross check all money needs to make sure it was used proper.  In addition to lying for money .. he lies about all aspects of his life to us.  

2.  Refuses to help himself.  Does not properly take his meds… and will not stick with a therapist.  The other day he said he wanted to go back to extensive therapy, but will not  call his doctor or act on what he needs.  He has the resources for help, but will mot use it.

3.  Not sanitary.  He has tendency to puke from his meds.  He says it’s a gag flex.  He puked in the center of the living room floor and in my office.  He would not clean it up.  Husband had to do it for him.  He will not keep his bathroom clean.. room is a disaster with dried up food on dishes all over his room.

4.  He eats us out of the house.  Anytime we go grocery shopping.. he will binge eat all the fresh food just purchased..in one sitting at night when we are sleeping.  Today locking refrigerator and cabinet.

5.  Steals.  If he sees anything of value he will take it from my purse.  Husband just added lock to outside my bedroom door to prevent theft.  One example:  he needed gas money.  Dad gave him a small list of easy chores to do first.  He would not do the chores.. instead took my car keys and took off with my car.

Our family is at a loss. Our daughter ( younger sister) is just appalled at him.  She says we need to kick him out.  As a family we have been there for support.. financially and emotionally.. but he will not help himself… how much more do we take of this.

212,What is a sign that your doctor is a drug pusher?,"I recently began receiving outpatient care from a local clinic system. The therapist was awesome and gave me some real critical thinking points. However, two weeks later I met with great disappointment over the ""psychiatrist"". Quite a lot of orange and red flags we're going on even within the waiting room. 

Ie. Conflict with the patient before me, not doing her own intakes, not being a doctor (as I was led to believe) and expecting an intake to last no longer than 30 minutes. 

I decided to benefit of the doubt most of this, as I am educated in this field as well, so I am not against a med student or a nurse-practitioner working on my case. So after a forty minute intake, they conferred over the bullet points of my information that the student took down and... ignored everything I said as irrelevant because they didn't like how I speak.

They seemed very obsessed with starting me on one of the two most popular meds being pushed right now. I have a history with severe adverse effects from newer medications, they also ignored this. I felt like a walking paycheck to them and when I challenged their logic they told me they would ""increase the dose, until it did work"" not consider they made a mistake.

I have had a family emergency this past two weeks that delayed me from trying this medication and I am back to just feeling completely uncomfortable with it again. My previous psychologist told me if anyone tried to label me with a pop-psych diagnosis to get up and walk right out of there. Sadly, I can't return to her due to covid-19, but does this sound like a case of shoving a square peg in a round hole for a quick buck?

This past week has been hellish to say the very least.  My spouse of over a decade attempted to end their life,  thank the larger than life beings that govern our existentce that I came home early and had life saving measures stocked at the house,  otherwise I may be typing a very different request. 

Essentially I am lost.  There is a lot of work from all parties,  myself included,  that need to be addressed. 

Ultimately I am reaching out to know what are the next steps,  I’ve never faced this reality before and I’m a planner,  the unknown terrify me.  

The 72 hr MH hold is up,  my spouse has been released into my custody and I’m more lost than our 6mo old puppy who is just learning to navigate life.  The house is essentially baby proofed and I’m home 24/7 so no worries there 

Where do I look next?  We can’t afford the time off work to do inpatient and the outpatient programs conflict with their work schedule.  They are working with their doctors and therapists but I feel like a group setting  of peers going through similar struggles is paramount to successful recovery,  I just don’t know where to look for these.  Do churches offer meeting like AA but for people whom only struggle with the MH aspect and not the substance abuse?

He would send me an email, after I left him, bitching and moaning and having a problem with my life for my choices, and it would derail me and I would take days to respond, days to come out every hint of fear and anger and loving so that I appeared rational and capable in my responses. I would rewrite four or five times, I would consult six different people, easily.

Just now, my ex-husband came at me with the same thing he has been coming at me with for six months. It's an old story by now, one which I have already addressed on multiple occasions. Instead of getting super upset, I simply restated my boundaries, clarified on some points which obviously we're not clear, because I placed a boundary so far in the distance, he thought that anything short that made him feel upset was worth trying to control me over, however a reminder that the boundary is in the distance and anything short of it is not covered by warranty, is the best I can do. 

I was nice, I apologize twice, one for my actions making him feel upset, while explaining in the next breath that my decisions are not for his feelings, but rather my own and for the law. I wrote it, I preferred it three times, change the couple words, removed all the emotional things before I even finished the sentences, and then I sent it within 5 minutes of composing it. In the past, such a thing would have terrified me and it would have been a very emotional email, usually a lot longer. 

But this time, it was short. Sweet. To the point. Boundaries, and nothing else. I feel almost like an adrenaline high. I'm currently in an intensive outpatient where I am practicing boundaries and learning all of the things which make me feel icky inside whenever somebody else does something against me. Understanding goes a long way towards controlling, and I just think I wanted to say, it got better for me and continues to. I'm learning how to say no.",1706542522.0,False,1,0,BheanGorm,None,1ady3it,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ady3it/it_used_to_take_me_days_to_write_an_email_of/
221,Set Back,"I'm currently in an intensive outpatient group after leaving inpatient care a few months ago. I'm trying to get my life back on track, but recently my boyfriend had a medical emergency and I handled it very poorly. I was angry, crying, being rude to people at the hospital. All out of character. I hadn't had a manic panic attack in a few weeks and I'm feeling like now I went backwards.",1619043425.0,False,2,1,Sadgayclown,None,mvqwhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mvqwhb/set_back/
222,Factitious Disorder?,"I think for some time I hadn’t ever considered that my brother may be exaggerating/making up his symptoms. I will try and summarise the story as much as possible. I would appreciate it so much if anyone is able to give any guidance on how to deal with this.

My brother is 62 and lives with my mother who is 90. He’s always had mental health issues and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in his teens. My family were from a generation where mental health was taboo so it was very hush hush.

He also has fibromyalgia and in the last 10 years has had other issues like light and sound sensitivity amongst other growing health issues. 

Before the pandemic he told me he was diagnosed with angina but he can’t take the medication for it because it would clash with other medicine. Before this I had taken his illnesses completely serious perhaps wanting to see the best in him. It could also be my mother constantly crying to me about how ill he is that made me feel guilty to think otherwise. “Your poor brother.” 

He went into hospital with severe chest pains a few months ago. I visited every evening after work for a week. He was on a high when he was there, talking so much and hard to make sense of what tests he had etc. So when I saw a doctor I called him over and asked if he had the test results. He went to get them and said he has a healthy heart with no signs of angina and they did every test there was. He discharged him. Since then he has been furious about how he was discharged without treatment. Any time I suggest going as an outpatient to have another opinion he says he doesn’t trust doctors and he is far too ill now to leave the house.

He has been verbally abusive to me, my husband and my kids. Saying personally horrible things and also that we don’t believe he’s ill and I’m spreading lies. He runs around screaming which is strange seeing as usually he walks with a stick and says he can’t breathe enough to talk for long. 

He is now stopping my mum from having any helpers round due to fear of getting covid with his condition. The house is getting full of dust and clutter and they won’t let me help. To be honest I can’t go there alone anymore because he gets so aggressive and it scares me. 

My mum is elderly and she has been manipulative herself in the past, but now she is vulnerable and it appears he is controlling her.

I have no idea what to do.",1709827846.0,False,1,2,GuiltySetting7355,None,1b8yhnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1b8yhnp/factitious_disorder/
223,Dad sent to hospital on Form 1,"Hi all,

Had to call the police today and have them take my dad to the hospital for a psych eval via form 1. This is in Canada. I think he has bipolar, and his mania is getting worse and he refuses to believe that he's nor normal, refusing to see a psychiatrist. 

This morning he called my aunt threatening to kill my mom and brother with a knife. 

My question is, how does a psychiatrist diagnose bipolar or schizo if someone denies any symptoms? 

I'm worried that they may discharge him with outpatient psych follow up. If that's the case, he for sure will not bother going.

224,My brother was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital for depression. How can we get him out if he wants to leave? Illinois,"The hospital he is in treats him like a prisoner. He is not allowed to have his phone, talk with friends, and hardly has any of his own clothes in there. He gets to make two calls a day to my parents and keeps expressing how badly he wants to get out of there but from all of the reviews I am reading about this hospital, they try and keep you there as long as your insurance will cover. He has been there for 72 hours and has submitted a written request to be discharged, but is there anything we can do to get him out of there by tonight or tomorrow? I want to help him out in any way that I can and it has been extremely hard knowing how horrible his experience has been in that place and he is being held there against his own will. We have an outpatient treatment plan lined up for him for when he is able to leave.",1651787478.0,False,2,2,sparklingh2o123,None,uj89ir,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/uj89ir/my_brother_was_voluntarily_admitted_to_a/
