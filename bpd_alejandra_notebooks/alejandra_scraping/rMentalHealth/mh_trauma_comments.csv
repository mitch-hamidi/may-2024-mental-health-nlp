4,"Not very, but I've never regained the confidence I Iost. I second guess myself where before I relied on my instincts, which were very good. I went through a process of coming to terms with my traumas and putting them behind me.

I fall into spurs of depression a lot to the point where I will sometimes go 2 -3 weeks without showering (I know it’s gross but I can’t help it. Also I use deodorant and perfume so I don’t stink). I have major trust issues. I also have like zero self respect and I let people walk all over me. I’ve never been in a relationship.

20,"It defines me, unfortunately. I feel like there is no me without my trauma. 

As early as 4 years old I was experiencing severe anxiety and CPTSD symptoms and no one (myself included) knew it. Because I had Dyscalculia (a learning disability) and because of the undiagnosed (active) trauma people assumed I was simply “special needs”.  

I also felt that I had no way of telling anyone what I was experiencing. (That my dad was abusing me.) I was at first too afraid but then I gradually realized that people were probably not going to believe me. (I was afraid people would think I was lying or making up stories for attention so I never said anything.) 
And on another level I just simply internalized the whole idea that what I was experiencing wasn’t the problem it was just that I was “stupid”. 

I was shut down emotionally and psychologically as a child. I was there physically but I wasn’t a participant when it came to the things around me. And so I never developed friendships or relationships with other people. In fact I felt the need to stay away from everyone. And that was what I have done for my entire life. 

Besides having CPTSD this also lead into me developing Schizoid Personality Disorder. 

I struggled throughout my 20s to function (hold down employment) and I experienced periodic breakdowns that landed me in the hospital. (I developed Anorexia at 20 and it helped me deal with some of my mental health issues but it also contributed to more health problems.) 
This continued up until I hit my 30s and I finally utterly collapsed. I had to stop working and I’m now on disability at 35 for my mental health issues. 

I have been hospitalized several times over and have been through multiple mental health programs but there isn’t any help for CPTSD or personality disorders. So my life (just as it has always been) is frozen. 

I wish I could get help but the help I need is expensive and completely out of reach. 

I have had my eating disorder for 15 years and this is probably how I’m going to go out. 

My trauma destroyed me long before I ever got to be a real person. I was killed off long ago as a child and now the body is the last thing to go.",TravelbugRunner,1b4chp0
21,"It literally destroys me. I’m 37 and still have trauma and triggers from when I was a child and a teenager. Nobody knows that of course, but everything replays over and over in my mind and it has been that way for years, even when I was in therapy.",Professional-Car-347,1b4chp0

23,It gave me a few disorders. Im on meds and I spend money on therapy 🥲.,PinkishHorror,1b4chp0
24,"I never really realized that aspects of how I grew up were traumatic (many of which I'm still experiencing now). I've been working with a fantastic therapist, though, who's done a great job of helping me discover that these things I'm so accustomed to are actually not okay and how much they still effect me. Most notably, my self-talk is incredibly negative, judgmental, and mean. I'm also very hardwired as a perfectionist and a people pleaser. I struggle with these things every day. I'm trying to change them, but it's exhausting trying to retrain your brain after a lifetime of conditioning. However, slowly but surely, I'm noticing small positive moments or changes that show that the hard work is worth it, even on the days it feels impossible.",ClingToTheGood,1b4chp0
25,"Not very prevalent really.

Most of the trauma I have was more about me reaching adulthood and feeling so held back from ever growing. What had happened right after highschool really messed up my head a lot. I looked to my future with at least some hope and optimism but I felt I was beaten so rigorously despite my best efforts that I just gave up.

The only thing I can recall from childhood that could be traumatic is when I was becoming friends with this girl in middle school during lunch period and then her BF came accusing me of hitting on her. I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about as I had literally no romantic desire for basically anyone. I had a pretty dry nose that day and he punched me straight there. It didn't hurt much really because he was skinny as fuck and smaller than me but the blood was gushing out alot and it freaked me the fuck out. Then shit happened later I don't want to get into it.

Can that be traumatic? Throughout the rest of my school life, I tried to stay away from communicating with girls too much and instead goofed off in the corner and had my own fun.",UlyssesCourier,1b4chp0

But I can’t talk to them without their disapproving looks or invalidating my feelings. I’ve been getting many panic attacks because I am scared of my parents reactions to me not being their “perfect” daughter. I don’t even cry in front of them because it was considered weak when I was little. They would tell me to stop crying or I will go to the corner.

31,"I was sexually abused when I was about 6 or 7, I don't know exactly because we don't usually remember a lot of it and how could I exactly remember 44 years ago. But that experience is implanted in my brain. I hadn't thought about it for decades but once the memories came backin full description at about 47yo I had an emotional breakdown.  I cried and cried.. I had never told anyone about it until very recently. But I remember the details still now as 6 year old I was coerced into sexual abuse. It has never left my memory but I think people have a coping mechanism that helps them to try to forget it for the time being. Then eventually you have to face it. I haven't worked this through therapy because I felt shameful and embarrassed.  Everyone needs to realize that they have to mention everything in therapy including sexual assault. It's so hard, I will admit, that I actually finally mentioned it with my new psychiatrist because I felt comfortable and it's absolutely necessary.  It's been 44 years now with this hanging over my head and I encourage anyone to do the same if they feel comfortable to do so.",Pleasetakemecanada,1b4chp0

44,"Just last night, a really traumatic memory that I had forgotten about resurfaced, and it was interesting because it made me realize how much progress I’ve made in healing from my trauma. 

Triggers that used to be so intense and debilitating 5+ years ago no longer are, and it’s genuinely incredible to see how far I’ve come. I still get triggered sometimes, but to a much milder degree. For someone who had an abusive upbringing and felt alone, unsafe, and extremely suicidal for much of my adolescence and young adulthood, I’m pretty well-adjusted nowadays in my late 20s. But it took a lot of self-work, a lot of communication with my abusive parent, and many difficult years to get here.

I feel really sad for my younger self and happy for my present self, but the gap is so huge that it’s hard to wrap my head around. A part of me never feels fully understood by friends around me who didn’t go through a similar degree of trauma. Some people do not and will not ever understand, because they just have not been through something that dark before, especially not in their formative years.

So although I’ve grown, healed, and am emotionally stable now, I carry my past selves and experiences inside me and I can’t detach from the reality of how much my trauma has shaped me. There’s probably more that I could unpack in therapy. But for the most part, I’m good these days, I’m happy, and I’m amazed at how far past the past I am. 

It’s possible to move past your trauma, and you don’t have to suffer from it forever or even allow it to affect you in ways you’re not aware of. Continue to be introspective and gentle with yourself, and be open to examining how your past experiences may be affecting you and your present thoughts/actions/relationships. And go to therapy and invest in your own healing, please. It’s a journey but it can and does get way, way better.",dreamsummit,1b4chp0
45,"I thought for the longest time it didn’t really affect me, that it just kinda rolled off my back, because the memories themselves don’t bother me. I can freely joke about how my mom used to beat the shit out of me. I never looked at how immensely it impacted my personality development. Funny/scary enough it clicked for me on a rewatch of Dexter during one of his monologues about how he is completely and totally alone and just pretends for everyone else’s sake and he’s tired of pretending and I was like “wait why does that resonate with me?” And then realized that not a single person in this world can name any basic facts about me like my favorite musicians or my life goals or my bucket list, nobody knows the thoughts that race through my head daily, and nobody really tries to. My stepmom is the only one that tries but coming from a white bread typical Americana family she doesn’t really get it, but atleast she tries. And at first I wanted to blame everyone else around me but I realized I was isolating myself from them because I learned from my mom that the way to make people happy and not beat you was to be anyone but yourself and just put a smile on. Not sure how to break through that habit but I guess recognizing it is a step in the right direction.",Delta_hostile,1b4chp0

I never thought it would affect me and i’d be okay, but since i was younger i’ve always had erratic moods.  Even has the 7 year old i was i couldn’t exactly understand what was going on but i had an idea of what was. I wasn’t fully aware of my situation.

But personally i know it does affect me mentally but that’s about it. I don’t cry anymore and i’m just angry 24/7. I’m not angry right now but most things make me angry if that makes sense.

Though, the school was extremely hard on me, so I decided to left the school and now I took another exam to study abroad, nailed it and I can almost say that I have the keys to study abroad now, which would effectively cost nothing to them.

However, they are not satisfied with that. I am sick of constantly explaining myself to them, why I did things but I love and respect them so I do that every fucking time. Their response is to say that 'yeah it is good but not enough, you didn't finish your school, blabla's son finished his school and now he is going abroad for Master's' By the way their GPA is shit, even all those are private universities and they didn't finish the school in time.

I was nothing but a good kid to them. I always tried to be one. Conditions in Turkey are extremely hard for a student, and I am working so that I won't be a burden to them financially and it looks like they are not satisfied with that either.

So, how it affects my life? Great question, when I was with my girlfriend she said that 'you are always explaining yourself, your actions. You don't need to explain everything.' and that hit me. I am constantly explaining myself to others, constantly criticizing myself and think about what would others say when I do this or do that.

I am insecure about myself and my criticism is not helping. The end result? I don't like myself even though when someone looks from afar, they would think that I sorted out almost everything. In the gym, I see myself extremely small, but others are telling me that I am one of the biggest guys there, constantly asking me how to lift stuff correctly et cetera.

I finished the exam that will allow me to study abroad past week, and after the exam I saw the results and immediately said that I could do better. The thing is, it allows me to study in almost every university in that country. So I always look down on my success, which destroys my confidence as a young man. 

I am 22 yo, but I think and act like an octogenarian. I always say to myself that if I talked my friends the way that I talk to myself then I wouldn't have any friends whatsoever and this is the sad truth about my past traumas. I know that mine is nothing when compared to others but someone who drowned in a pool is just as dead as the one who drowned in the ocean.",albus_dumbbelldore,1b4chp0

I also notice that I often can get nightmares centering around being abused or being afraid of them (though the dreams are usually not 100% accurate to reality and more just related to the feeling of being degraded/manipulated/attacked by them). Lastly, I am a HUGE people pleaser and am always stressing about whether people like me or approve of me or whether they’re mad at me.

I think you need to ask for therapy sessions. It makes a world of difference depending on the severity. Then they can decide if you need medication to help.

You will heal as you get older but it's an insanely long process depending on where you live and what they decide your diagnosis is. My diagnosis was held as truth when I was 19 and it never left my record even though it was false. So I spent 30 years of my life being treated for something I didn't have and it affected my entire life.
I finally got out of the government mental health system  because I finally have insurance through my job.  It may sound weird for me to be excited over a bipolar2 diagnosis but I've never been asked about those things because my file on record stated schitzoaffective disorder and I can guarantee that was a decision by a bad psychiatrist who was lazy and just contributed my actual symptoms as psychotic. And unfortunately it sticks to you like glue even if it's not accurate. 

I'm just happy after 30+ years they've got a real diagnosis and I can finally be correctly treated for it. That includes meds and therapy.

9,"I like the message but I want to share a dissenting view (which actually may not be that contrary to what op is saying, if you think about it):

If all of my memory is trauma, isn't it normal at that point?

I recall everything, even when I don't want to. Obsessively, endlessly, in what I call thought spirals until I reach a logical conclusion.

I wasn't abused, or neglected, and I had an easy life, but I can't turn my brain off. I react reflexively to things I remember without realizing it. This has actually saved my ass quite a few times, but it has caused problems when I absolutely felt I HAD to do something. What's worse is that I've done this to the point that I seem to be pushing forward, past the present and reacting to things that 'might' happen. Nothing seems new anymore, I have trouble being surprised now. The moment I see something, it is like I've always known it and we're repeating something that has already happened. Even your post feels like a well worn path that I have seen hundreds, thousands, infinite times before and I can't show any proof that I've seen it.

Don't get me wrong, I have been through traumatic events, but they seem like a relatively small part of my problem. Every moment, my mind seems to be in pain as it simply accepts all information. If a pain is constant, you get used to it. On some level I am suffering but on a whole I'm lost in a sea of information, following instinct and pondering the framework of all knowledge. The way I see it, my biggest danger is accepting that as a new existence and withdrawing into my mindscape.

As I understand, some people would kill to get a slice of what I just described, thinking it's a blessing. It's a flood, a sea, I can pick out specific points of knowledge but it would take eternities to get it all out. Knowing how things flow doesn't always mean I can change it, or that I can fully see what's going to happen. I follow patterns, tweak my own, and hope for the best. Sometimes I have even found that I hide knowledge from myself by willfully ignoring a memory.

Furthermore, as extreme and unbelievable as this sounded, I'm actually watering down my life experience. Every wrong choice, every mistake, every unknown, every unsolvable problem, rattling around in my head until all I could do was simply work the memories as my brain seemed to want to. This was debilitating, distracting, and consumed monstrous amounts of mental energy. My personal and professional lives suffered, I made mistake after mistake and dug my self-made hole deeper and deeper. It got better, but it sucked for sooooooo long.

Of course I had to get it under control, and I'm working on taking advantage of it. Right now, all I got is basic situational awareness, and strangely, an eye for the ladies. I always check for a feeling about whether it's the right time to do something. Seems to work. One of the funniest manifestations of my strange intuition is how I will seemingly change up my entire day just to get a good look at a nice butt. Yeah, it's a bit perverted, but it happens. It's not like stalker level, either. It ends up being in passing, like stuck behind someone in line, or a woman bending over right when I come around a corner. I don't make an effort to consciously remember people and their schedules, and I don't think any of them repeat often aside from ones I live near, but it definitely feels better than chance. Reminds me of the anime trope of females falling on the protagonist or vice/versa.

Edit: I'm trying to learn how to bring back the 'surprise' feeling without going off the rails. What I've been doing recently is habitually avoiding direct recall, and thus the strange habit of looking for booty seems to have come about. I'm also on the spectrum, they say that similar people traumatize easier and it seems my dial was set to 'always'.",bandrews4795,mzmt4k

I certainly can attest to experiences breaking us, and leaving us broken. I survived an emotionally/mentally abusive parent, among a lot of other horrible stuff. It changed me for the worst. That wasn't what broke me, though. It wasn't the lying/cheating ex, losing a child, or even some of the occupational stuff that's contributed to PTSD. Many years ago I had a workplace incident, and required reconstructive surgery. They put me back together, but after losing more bone and flesh just so they could stitch me back together. I was certainly broken and most definitely am not whole now that I'm missing a body part! Why would I mention this? I believe it's important to have a laugh, even when we're dealing with morbid things. In no means do I believe that people suffering unseen traumas are broken or not whole; I'm just being cheeky and hoping to give someone a cheap laugh. So there you have it- I'm living proof some trauma leaves people broken and not whole!",,mzmt4k

4,"All these tips that we may give may seem easy to do, but it is difficult to overcome your trauma. It may take months or years to heal from it. But here is mine:

- I gave myself time to feel my emotions and traumas. I also talked to counselors, trusted friends, and families about it.
- I looked for a loving community whom I know that would understand my situation and would listen to me.
- Explored hobbies that I never tried such as acting, calligraphy, etc. and also enhanced my skills so my attention will be focused on something else.
- Kept with me an emotional journal, to keep track of my thoughts and have something to release my emotions
- Seeked help. Very challenging at the beginning but it felt much better afterwards.

-doing your responsibilities (gives you a sense of accomplishment)
-quitting sad music

11,My best and only friend died in April right before my birthday and two weeks later I found out my partner was cheating. I already had PTSD but for some reason having these two things happen woke me up to this realization that maybe what had happened to me previously wasn't so bad. I realized I had taken so much for granted when I could just have been happy instead of fixating on my trauma. To some degree happiness *is* a choice and there are some things in life you will never accept or feel good about but you can just let it be. I have my off moments still when I PMS and the intrusive thoughts creep up but for the most part I'm doing so much better than I was. You don't have to get over your trauma or find some reasoning in it you just have to accept it was something that happened and it's not the present any longer.

I no longer hold a crippling fear of going blind or going mute because they are all unwanted transitions rather than ends of my existence. If I do somehow go blind or mute, I know I will struggle to adapt but that I would eventually adapt to that new experience and live on. Ive learned to use the logic that all things are transitions rather than ends in order to lessen my fears and continue moving forward in life. I manage my trauma by reminding myself of the lessons Ive learned since I gained this memory and fear. I seek counseling when my stress is at its highest, I use meditation and calming music when my stress makes things hard, and I choose to force myself through anxiety and into new situations to enjoy more in life.

I hit everything that touch me and often get physically aggressive toward others. My phases of mood changes with hallucinations and delusions have worsened ever since. I can't even trust anyone anymore and I feel like I'm losing more and more of my sanity by the day. But even though I haven't recovered from the trauma, I have learned how to cope with the trauma and look toward the future instead of the past.

48,"I am going to do my best to help protect my ""future children"" from the residual effects.  I know my mom tried her hardest, but even losing us due to my Father being abusive (it was for one year).  Up into our early stages of life/up to adulthood she wouldn't be able to stop ""holding onto"" me and my sister.  Calling us, ""the team of three"" and she would have panic attacks /I remember the one she had when I was 17, on the day she lost us years ago and I never saw her breakdown like that it was in the bathroom and I held her as she gasped for air.  We were toddlers when we were put in foster care for a year; however, it effected her for many years.

She went through a lot of trauma and it only set fire to the codependency my mom and I had.  Up until her passing November of 2021.  I miss her and this is the first time in life and I just turned 30 last week, that I am learning to depend on myself.  Make it through hell and back, literally.  I've been running from a toxic rental, to living with neighbors, ended up almost having my life taken, to surger, to ending up legitimately homeless again and without much help, up until now and still, I do not have anything set in stone.

I always worked, but I know if my mother was alive, I wouldn't be in this situation and even when she was in a shelter for domestic violence when I turned 18... I passed up university and went to be with her so she wouldn't be alone and helped her through it.  I do not regret anything. 

My dad has changed a lot through his life and it took a lot of forgiveness; however, my mom would take out her anger on me at times, and because I looked like my father the most.  When she would go through stages.  I forgive her and I forgive my father.  He had a stroke last October and he is unable to speak/eat and one side of his body is still paralyzed.  Even after my dad has left me in the past, I know even if he had the capability to help me right now he would.  He began to open his heart up more to me.

My father had trauma too and never opened up too much about it.  He did say I was a mirror image of him and it made him afraid to see me/be with me.  We spoke for hours and it turned into the best day ever and it happened to be at the court house on his bday.  Lol I had criminal court and he thought he had court about his prior house.  He chose to stay and support me and He said it was the best birthday he had.

I love both of my parents.  With age I am learning how to control my trauma the best I can, but unfortunately it has been neverending lately.  It does trickle down through generations.  My mom always told my sister and I to, ""stay away from men!"".  Honestly, it would be too much at first, but after her abusive marriage with my step father she did vow to never be with a man again and was going to remain celibate.  She actually did for at least a decade up until her passing.  Even though my dad and her were oddly getting kind of close again, but she would always say, ""I would never be with your father again."".

Luckily my sister got a picture of them both hugging and they definitely were each other's twin flames.  Twin flames aren't always the easiest relationships and it is the other half of you having to learn lessons.  I still believe when my father saw my mom laying in her bed after I called him screaming, I think that's what really causes the stroke (not only just the missed heart medicine and we found out he was putting so much pain on himself for not being there for us.  My sister and I.  We do have a half sister who he was primarily in her life).  It definitely broke my dad's heart and my intuition will never change on that.

It's time to break generational ""curses"" and bury the past and start a new.  I am doing everything in my power.  I am not a victim.  I am a survivor and a fucking Warrior.  People look at me and look flabbergasted, but I always struggled it off; however, I am finally take accountability for how extreme the scenarios I went through in my life have been.  I always felt like, ""woe is me"" if I would ever say anything and that's how a lot of my family treated me.  I no longer care about how other's perceive me (in the best way possible).  I'm now going to downplay anything anymore.

67,"I’ve been in therapy for all of my life, but the specific trauma I’m referring to happened in 2014 when I was 10-11 years old. When I reached my mid teens I was finally able to have these therapy sessions alone and in October 2019, five years after the traumatic period finished I finally opened up because I didn’t wanna talk about it with my mom there yet (she has some idea but still doesn’t know). We didn’t go over it much but finally opening up to people about it allowed me to begin healing and just processing and understanding what had happened to me.

By March 2020 I was truly a well rounded person and very mature for my age, something that couldn’t have been said for most of my life, and no, not until this year have I actually had my shit together. I wasn’t allowed to have my victory, my happy ending to that school year, so I regressed and then got incredibly angry and jaded at the state of the world. I’ll never look at this country like how I did before COVID again, I just can’t.

And yes, in May/June 2021 we DID get the happy ending we always wanted, and the high that 2021 hit was probably higher than what 2020 without COVID would have hit but it’s only because we got our chance for cherished senior memories back with so little precious time to spare. If COVID had hit a month later our prom and normal graduation might not have happened. But it still wasn’t long enough. I needed more than a month of normal high school at the end to truly get back to where I had been 14 months beforehand.

2021 was when I got back to that point that I had been in late 2019 and early 2020 to an extent. The fall of my freshman year of college had some moments that reminded me of the fall of my junior year. Then Omicron happened and once again COVID jaded me and sent me into another depression. 2022 was mostly bad, but not in a way that would cause problems down the line like 2014 or 2018 did, thankfully almost all of the 2018 trauma I successfully worked through in 2019. And now it’s 2023 and this year has thankfully felt like 2019 with how much I’ve been able to grow and learn as a person. I joked three years ago about how I wouldn’t truly get over COVID until I was a junior again and well, that just might be the case.",Savings-Pace4133,16tev2h

70,"EMDR is truly hard work.  My one session a few years ago (btw we didn't start one on one before jumping into emdr and I only showed up for a few times out of the blue due to work right before COVID), anyway, let's just say I (*)ran(*) out of the building before doing the ""dialing back"" of the session and the outro meditation with relaxing sound, or a sound that uplifted me.

Let's just say, I wasn't ready and one on one would have been the best.  Not only that, my job made me unable to maintain a steady schedule/one at all.  The therapist retired not that long after, so I'm glad I never got ""attached"".

I have a new therapist and I am finally making time in my life for therapy and to recieve the self-care I need!  Oddly they gave me a therapist who was open and guess what she specializes in DBT (and trained the other therapist on it), and used to work at the Institute of Living, but I am seeing her elsewhere and in another area.  

I wanted a DBT therapist/therapy so bad and purchased self help DBT books before to learn when I was unable to seek treatment.  So this is a true blessing.  She also knows when to cut me off when I start rambling and I told her to keep it real with me.  And shut me down when I am just speaking some bad excuse 😅🤣 not that I truly am, that's just how it feels like, but she definitely is helping me to go back from my previous habits of my learned way of dealing with trauma.

3,"Treating trauma is difficult and requires a lot of patience and time. There’s a treatment intervention called Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), specifically designed for treating PTSD. You would start by identifying what’s called the “index trauma”. This is a fancy term for the worst trauma you experienced. You would be using worksheets. You would briefly describe the trauma. Then you would write down how you think that trauma affected your thoughts and beliefs about you and the world of people you live around. Then you would try and write one sentence describing what you now believe based on the trauma. For example, someone remembers being emotionally abused by their parents throughout their childhood. Because of that trauma they now have a belief that those people who are supposed to love and protect you will betray your trust. This belief is more often unconscious and gets triggered by situations where you are being asked or expected to trust someone. Once you are sure of the core belief at work when you’re triggered you then begin to look for evidence that this belief is not true. Or evidence that it is true. Most of the time you will find evidence that shows you that not everyone that’s supposed to protect and support you will betray you. You work with this repeatedly until you can honestly shift the belief to something more accurate, like. “Not everyone who is supposed to protect and support me will betray me. Some people are okay.” You would repeat this exercise with any other beliefs or loyalties that changed due to trauma. Working with a therapist trained in CPT is essential if you want to address your history of trauma.",Hungry_Wolf33,1cef42a
4,"Sorry for that. I suppose you've been doing talk therapy. Unfortunately it does not work on trauma. You need a therapy that focuses on that. One of the effective therapies for trauma is EMDR. And you can do it online.

15,"I may be off the mark but this is what I mean when I tell people to let it go. 


First, accept that it happened. That sounds obvious, it did actually happen. But a lot of people distance themselves from trauma and while they ""know"" it happened they don't allow themselves to really sit in and feel the emotions associated with it. You really were hurt. You really were traumatized. A person you loved or trusted really did something bad. You have to sit in and accept everything associated with your trauma, not just the hurt but the shame, the self blaming, the fear, the hard stuff that we say we ""feel"" but that we seperate ourselves from with secondary emotions like anger. First, accept that it really did happen to you, it is now part of your story and your reality. 



Second, accept whatever part you played in your own trauma. You chose to stay in an abusive relationship, you made choices that put you in a dangerous spot, you didn't listen to your gut when it said leave, you didn't tell an adult what was happening, you didn't scream, you didnt fight, etc. This is *not* about fault or blame, this is about acknowledging your own agency and the choices you did or did not make. Don't discount it, this step is important because it is the very beginning of reclaiming your power and sense of control. 



Third, forgive yourself for whatever part you played in your own trauma. Accept that whatever choices you did or didn't make were the best choices you *could* make at the time. If you'd had better information, more knowledge, the benefit of hindsight you may have made different choices but at the time you did the best with what you had. If you survived it, you made the right choices whatever they were. You did the best you could with what you had, and you have to forgive yourself for that. 




And finally, let it go. Make peace with reality and start looking for ways to move forward from what happened. What different choices could you make? What classes, skills, experiences can you use to try and make better choices if you're ever in that situation again? What does the future look like? What has changed from then to now so you'll be better equipped to deal with or avoid it in the future? Stop being stuck at point A in the past and start moving towards the future of point B.",AlyssaXIII,1cef42a
16,"It does not mean to not let it mess with your life. Trauma will always mess with your life.
Letting go means to understand that certain things are out of your control. Those things we can not control should not give us anxiety and for things we can control. Take the learning experience as a lesson and realize that not all people are bad, and not all situations will have the same negative outcome. 
PTSD is a very real thing, and it's hard to heal from when you keep reliving it daily, and it's hard not to relive it daily. Once you learn to accept that it happened, then you can slowly allow yourself to put it behind you.",Appraxis_8474,1cef42a

Definitely don't take that as me self diagnosing. At this point in time, its just heavily suspected. But people on here have given me advice for going down a path for help.

But regardless, all of my behaviors match up to having developed severe BPD. Honestly could write a book about all the shit I went through and still remember more after its already published and weighs 10 pounds.

But more so on the topic. I will say, I've been able to heal some aspects of myself on my own. I still have many problems, but certain ones have healed. If you look at my page, it can explain a for a little more context. But it took my stepdad literally dying, plus an extra two years for me to be able to heal from what he did. And it took an apology, a genuine apology from my mother for me to ""let go"" of the trauma.

What worked for me was actually being able to talk about my experiences, instead of having to keep them a secret, and getting an apology from the one who hurt me. But sometimes, it doesn't even have to take that. Sometimes, it just happens. One day you might wake up and finally just feel at peace with a piece of your trauma. That happened to me too.

Long story short, it happens naturally. Closure can help too, but healing is really something that just comes to you. Of course therapy can help too, but only you can heal you.

Theres wounds that need longer to heal than others. And I'm absolutely no expert but I think everyone can break out of every unhealthy pattern and stay out by reflecting and recognizing when it wants to come back. You just have to really want it and take your time.

Letting go starts with you allowing yourself to feel the bad feelings you've been running away from. It starts with accepting that the bad stuff did actually happen - and it is so hard. You're hurt and it feels like shit.

And slowly it doesn't feel as heavy anymore. You go through the phases of denial and anger, then feeling low and maybe trying to bargain to make it all go away and it may happen randomly that you become angry and sad again but eventually you'll get to the end of the tunnel.
That's what it means to truly let go and heal.",ankitaj-psy,1cef42a

14,"Death and desertion can both be very traumatic. My dad confronted me at 8 years old with this question: do you want to live with me or your mom.  My dad was never nice, never pleasant with me from what I can remember so of course I said mom. He left never paid child support and emptied the bank account on my mom. Left her with a 2 year old and 8 year old and a mortgage… I was angry always angry still am a bit and I’m 40 this summer. Things like this really do shape us. 


I found him when I was 25 and we (my mom) took him to family court in Ontario Canada for back payments of child support. Ruined him financially. 2 months after this I found that I had 2 half sisters, bother older than me that he abandoned before meeting my mother. one in California one in Montreal. He wants nothing to do with any of us. He now lives in Ottawa where he lives with a lady whom he married and brought back from the Philippines… because no self respecting North American woman would put up with his shit. Lol

Just because someone has suffered doesn't make your pain less significant to you.


Furthermore, more everyone handles stress and trauma differently, AND what you see on the surface isn't always the truth. People who have adjusted to severe trauma still feel pain and struggle.

16,"I’m so sorry for the losses you’ve experienced. It’s so difficult to manage life at any time, let alone when you experience significant losses at such a young age. Losing a parent at that age is very traumatic. You wrote you lost your friends at the same time. All those losses in one month? I’d be surprised if you weren’t traumatized. People will often make comparisons to people who’ve lost much more. They think they’re trying to be helpful, but all it says to me is that they’re uncomfortable sitting with your pain. They’re trying to fix it so they don’t have to bear witness to your suffering. Complex PTSD can look a lot like BPD if you’re constantly being triggered by your environment. I’d suggest seeing a professional to do what’s called a differential diagnosis. They can help you sort out what mental health conditions you’re experiencing. Regardless, I wish you the courage, strength and love it takes to endure loss and live a life where you are thriving.",Hungry_Wolf33,1bk9p3u
17,"So when I was young, I lost my bestfriend since birth to a vehicular accident at age 14, lost a girl I thought of as a sister at 14, lost another 2 friends at 15 to a car wreck, at 16 I lost my father to cancer and watched him take his final breath in my arms, since then I’ve lost 7 other people close to me in life (I am now 23 years old) 
It will definently affect you in the long run. I find myself very introverted. I don’t enjoy going out and meeting new people, it may because I don’t want to get close to anyone anymore because of the fear of feeling that deep pain again.
I’ve dealt with very bad night terrors and overall physical health problems (I’ve had 7 surgeries since I was 16 years old) 
But I do my best to keep my head above the water.

Just know it’s okay that you feel any which way. Your feelings are valid and you should not feel as if you’re being dramatic for feeling such feelings. 

I disassociated for a long long time and it overall made everything much much worse. It wasn’t until around the start of this year that I started to really process all the things I’ve been through in life and work through my mental health problems. 3 days ago I had another surgery and have been laid up pretty much since then other than getting up long enough to get water, I’ve packs, sometimes making food if possible. It’s given me plenty of time to think over a lot of what’s gone on in my life and proves the fact that I’ve shoved everything so deep down that it’s been coming back to haunt me in the long run.

Feel what you feel, process it, but never let it hold you back from doing what you need to do in life. If you ever need an ear to vent to I’m always open. I’m a very big advocate of people just sometimes needing someone who understands to talk to. Hope you feel better man🙏🏼❤️",FrontAutomatic8579,1bk9p3u
18,"Yes, absolutely. Losing anyone close to you can (and probably will) cause trauma. The only difference between you and others is the fact that they probably (forgive me for making assumptions, but this is the only thing that makes sense in my head) had access to better support groups and the sort that helped them grieve and recover. Besides that, everyone’s brain works differently. I will react to loss differently than even my own siblings. There’s nothing wrong with you, and you’re not worse for taking things as you have. If anyone calls you dramatic for being affected by loss, they’re just being insensitive.

0,"As a child, I learned a harsh lesson: when tears flowed freely and my heart ached, my family's response was to turn a blind eye. Their indifference left me feeling abandoned and unheard, teaching me to stifle my emotions and bear my struggles in solitude.

Over the years, this pattern became my norm. I grew accustomed to locking away my pain, afraid to burden others or be met with more dismissiveness. Even as the weight of my troubles threatened to crush me, I clung to my solitary existence, believing that seeking help would only lead to further disappointment and isolation.

But deep down, beneath the facade of self-reliance, lay a yearning for connection and understanding. It was a longing I buried beneath layers of stoicism, afraid to acknowledge my vulnerability and the desperate need for support.

So, I persisted in my silent suffering, convincing myself that this was the price of independence and strength. Yet, with each passing day, the emptiness gnawed at my soul, and the walls I built around my heart grew taller and thicker.

Until one day, I realized that true strength lies not in solitary endurance, but in the courage to reach out, to let others in, and to share the burdens that weigh us down. And though the journey toward healing may be daunting, I vowed to break free from the chains of self-imposed isolation and embrace the support and compassion that awaited me on the other side.",strongerguy,1c4pxa8

I was in disassociated states frequently and experienced a lot of anxiety. (I was out of my body or deep inside my mind most of the time.) 

Besides isolation I self soothed by rocking back and forth often. (And when I got older I self soothed by walking, biking, and running a lot. Movement has always been a coping mechanism.) 

I can definitely say the freeze response was active while growing up (and it hasn’t really gone away). My freeze response over time went into overdrive and it led to me developing Schizoid Personality Disorder.",TravelbugRunner,1c4pxa8

14,"I watch everything. When I walk into a room I scan it all. I make sure I know where the doors and exits are and where everyone is. I watch people's movements, listen to their voices, look at their facial expressions(the small ones are relevant too), because I need to know if they are or are going to be a threat. 


When I meet someone new I near instantly take it all in. Behavior, tone of voice, facial expressions, body posture, how they introduce themselves, how they were acting before they go for a handshake. Clothing, shoe choices, level of personal hygiene ducking all of it. Not all the details matter, but most do. Because I have to very quickly figure out if i may need to defend myself or get away and how I need to arrange my face.




I prefer to have my back in a corner or be sitting just behind everyone else. I prefer facing the door. I plan routes of escape the moment I enter a room.


I also take note of things that can be used to hit or be thrown at someone. Books, figurines whatever. The location of furniture that can be broken easily in anger and plan escape paths around them.


I observe, I listen, I keep a finger on the pulse of the room and can react very quickly if I need to.


Constant vigilance. Because anything less can mean I get hurt.






I also mask most of my emotions even to those close to me. I mask a lot of my adhd and bipolar symptoms too. I can be absolutely raging inside but youll only see someone calm and collected. 


I also mask and otherwise diminish the signs of my neurological disorder symptoms. River of molten electricity running down my body? Still standing, still talking to customers or other work tasks.  For sure I will go and cry in the employee locker room for a bit later on, but no one at work and very few people ever see me cry because it shows weakness and loss of control.

I still do this quite commonly and even have to catch myself if I’m in a parking lot for too long because I definitely look odd if someone notices I’m not on the phone or something.

It’s gets long, and lengthy sometimes but overall it’s one of the best coping mechanisms I have for my anxiety.

1. Loud noises makes me jump. 
2. Sink full of dishes triggers anxiety (mom had a melt down a broke a whole sink full of dishes angrily once when I was a kid)
3. I assume everyone will hurt me so I isolate myself. 
4. Fear of being misunderstood or judged.
5. Shame. I blamed myself for anything that went wrong.
6. The thought of death was comforting, like a way out of the misery. I would fantasize about dying constantly. I would think maybe THEN my family would love me. Sick to think about now.
7. Sound of children crying or screaming makes me hold my breath. 
8. Back pain from being in fight or flight.
9. As a teen I had serious anger issues and would lash out at siblings or ex boyfriends. This was due to paranoia that everyone had it out for me.
10. Self harming was me feeling anything else but numb. It was nice to feel the pain physically that I felt internally. It was like a drug to me. Toxic.
11. I dated and “attracted” narcissists into my life because it felt normal? Like I didn’t see the red flags.
12. Self sabotage for sure. Drinking to pass out. Going out downtown by MYSELF as an 18 yo girl to do experimental drugs because I was so suicidal. Self medication with drugs and alcohol. I am sober and do not drink. I was able to regulate my drinking in my late 20s, but I still got into shady situations and had relationships crumble due to alcohol.
13 A lack of trust for anyone. Took years to learn how to trust people. If you have supportive people who don’t abandon you, you can learn to trust again.
14. Always anticipating the worst case scenario. So many bad things happen to me, it’s almost like I’m afraid of good things happening because I feel like it’s too good to be true or they will get stolen from me.

0,"hmm the experience is different for everyone. but for me personally, id say trauma is something that shifts the way my brain operates  :/ as in, situation happens that cause flight or fight and any similar stimulus create that same response..if that makes sense. like, ive heard some not so nice things said about me that definitely weren't pleasant, but for me personally i wouldn't say it traumatized me. just unpleasant for that period of time then i move on..

versus when i was younger and i witnessed my grandma having a seizure. sounds silly maybe, but it trauamatized me. i was in first grade. i completely shut down and began to freak out, no prefrontal cortex lol. and since then, seeing a person shaking or something similar to a seizure causes my heart to beat out of my chest and my body temperature to rise. 

she actually had one this morning and my sister called me. i could hear my grandma doing that breathing people do after a seizure (i forgot the term) and my heart started beating hard and body temperature... you get the point, i think.",satorisweetpeaaa,1bqvcro

3,"Trauma can be obtained vicariously. Meaning it doesn't have to be direct. Also what might not be traumatic to one person can be traumatic to another. Also sometimes people don't experience trauma responses until after they have realized what happened wasn't ok, Also known as delayed trauma. As a person who identifies a queer. I was never directly called any of those things but I witnessed a friend who was out throughout high school be harassed. It kept me in the closet and I experienced indirect trauma as a result. What is interesting about vicarious trauma is that it is not limited to victims or even witnesses. Abusers can experience trauma from their own actions when they realize what they have done (that's why recovery programs for people like that are important). Therapists are capable of obtaining trauma from hearing about traumatic events, but are trained on handling that.

Fun fact. Do you know the origins of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder? It was originally called shell-shock. It was first something diagnosed for soldiers in I believe it was WW1 (I don't like war so I'm a little fuzzy on which war it was) and soldiers who were in lethal combat often suffered from this. But here's the thing. Not every combat veteran got shell shock. Many of them did. But not all. Anyway I guess my point was just to double down on the whole ""trauma isn't the same for everyone"" thing. Some guys found war traumatic (understandably) and some didn't.",ADHD_Misunderstood,1bqvcro

3,"I would say not very likely.

From what i understand, what we call Trauma is an experience that causes our entire system so much stress (either because it happens so fast or is very disturbing in some way) that our body shuts down parts of our senses/conscious perception.

Because of that, the experience cannot be processed like a normal memory, and it can get repressed or flash back up in situations we experience as triggering (the brain recognizes the familiar pattern and rings the alarm). And every time the alarm is rung, the nervous system gets distressed (fight or flight) and if this happens continuously, we get trapped in survival mode, making it harder for the nervous system to heal and regain balance. 

So the way to ""heal trauma"" is to allow the brain to relive traumatic memories/experiences in a safe environment (that allows our nervous system to remain calm). That way the body begins to understand that there are other ways to react to a traumatic pattern than with fight or flight and we can normalize our reaction and feel safer in those situations. This is the goal of classic ""talking"" psychotherapy, you talk about  your trauma in a safe space, giving you the chance to process it with time and learn new ways to react.

So, the person who caused you trauma can \*in theory\* create a safe space and allow you to process your trauma and thus heal it. But that would require a lot of maturity and ethical behavior from the one who caused the trauma. 

In my experience, the ones causing pain are never the ones willing to heal others.",helpfulpotatoarmy,19drqjm
4,"Nooe, healing is all you.  Support systems are good, though.",BugOk9407,19drqjm
5,I believe that the person could try by apologizing sincerely and showing that it's not repeated.,Witty-Ad17,19drqjm
6,"Nope! Usually the people who cause trauma do so because they are incapable, unwilling to admit, or actually took pleasure in the trauma they caused.

On the very rare chance that the person who caused your trauma got therapy and did A LOT of work on themselves they may be able to offer sincere apologies and implement changes to ensure trauma no longer happens; but they can't heal you from the trauma that they caused to you- you have to do that for yourself. 

I remember this big push on confronting your abuser for closure a few decades ago... many people didn't think they could finish their healing because they couldn't get ""closure"" from their abusers (either deceased, unwilling to meet, wouldn't admit or take accountability for what they did, etc...) and that being a whole thing...

Because I'm old school, and was around to hear that a major part of trauma recovery, I thought I needed that to let go of my earliest major trauma where my brother was concerned. I found him through Facebook and we spent some time together getting to know each other again. He couldn't admit what he did (even 30yrs later) and as I got to know him I realized he was everything my mother had said: manipulative, self serving, predatory, ego centric, and the lies- the unnecessary lies that made no sense and didn't need to be told. You couldn't believe anything the man said unless you could actually verify it by way of another source, and for absolutely no reason at all 🤷‍♀️

I did get what I needed from him though.

I got that my mother was right about who he was, that he wasn't ever going to admit or apologize for what he did, I found out that my mom tried to get him to accept fault so I didn't have to testify in court against him as a child (a whole nother trauma), and I got that I didn't mean as much to him as he said or he ever meant to me- he dropped off the face of the world without notice, opened my DMs and never responded despite my efforts to love him, help him and simply to inform him of our parents progressing illnesses... That allowed me to close the door on him, which was HUGE because prior to that he had (in my young mind) been ripped away from me and kept from me against our wills (another trauma).

I got to have a brother for a few months and it was great while it lasted. I got to teach him things, learn some stuff and get a feel for who is as a person.

But who is as a person is exactly why I was traumatized by him to begin with. I was never a person to him- i was only ever a possession, an object, something to be used to make him feel good. It was never about me or my needs, and that's enough closure on that topic 🙃",BIGepidural,19drqjm

You can learn more about trauma from a book by Dr. Glenn Schiraldi, The PTSD Sourcebook.

Is it nature or nurture? I’ll never know. I’ve thought long and hard about my childhood and I can’t think of anything more traumatic than my dad leaving.

Then I wrote out everything I went through and talked to my therapist and they were shocked. They said that was absolutely abuse, lying and an awful lot to go through. 

Just because I came from a relatively middle class home (a lot of hidden financial problems) from a small boring town and got the typical life of someone from here (went to school and college) doesn’t mean my trauma wasn’t real. 

You might think you haven’t gone through anything as bad as others but I bet if you were to talk it through with someone else they would agree you went through a lot.

14,"For your question i also suggest to ask on self improvement sub. There seem to be more professional answers. Maybe you can ask how could you deal with this and thoughts of invalid mental health issues. Basically to improve your view on the subject.

Here is my take (with similar experience): Your issues or feelings and problems are valid. There doesnt have to be a clear trauma. Trauma response can be also from cumulative happenings. I personally have everything good but still battle with mental health issues for over ten years with different problem behaviours. Even though its good or helpful to know reason why, it's not a necessity always. If you feel your life is good otherwise, but battle with certain problem behaviour its possible to just work on that and how to control the issue. Sometimes cause is not necessary to be known to deal with an mental health issue. 

You can self reflect ofc and in therapy to work that if there is some issues you think are small but have big effect. You can also just keep living normally, but work on the problem behaviour. There is nothing wrong with you by having even serious mental health issues with out trauma. I know that thought process, kind of a ""but why""  because i have it too. I just needed to accept it as being so. I dont agree with it but accept it as being the case.

There are possibility of that physically in our brains some problem that generate certain behaviours and those should be checked too. It can be chemical or physiological. Medications can example help, but i think you are familiar with this already.",Tulired,197uh4a

It's also possible that experiencing the emotions of other people could have some effect on you as well. I think a good start would be to start naming the emotions that you're feeling anytime that you are feeling depressed and suicidal. If you have to write them down in a journal, then absolutely do so because it will help you to think about the things that you are experiencing.

In addition, it's also important to understand that we all experience life differently from each other. What is traumatic for 1 person may not be traumatic for another. Or a different person may be able to handle that trauma differently than yourself.

0,"I'm echoing some of the thoughts here. Trauma can be overcome. It takes: 

1) ability to see self, to recognize unhealthy behaviors and thought patterns,
2) proactivity and intentionality to process and overcome,
3) a commitment to change and to think about what you are thinking about,
4) willingness and open-mindedness, to take suggestion,
5) personal fortitude, you gotta dig deep and get comfortable being uncomfortable, 
6) goals. Who do I want to be? Ask yourself that. Vision. And do you value yourself enough to know you should be and can be and deserve to be better.

No, none of that is easy, sometimes it is. When the pain becomes greater than the fear of change, we start to take steps to change. Every human possesses inherent value, outside of circumstances and past traumas. Have a goal to thrive vs just surviving. Life can look vastly different if you can rise above where trauma will hold you. I say don't let trauma define you or your life. To overcome is to win.

4,"Not all trauma is possible to find peace in. I know that's certainly the case for my own. I'll likely never have my traumas resolved but that's only because of the complexity and depth of mine and how long things went on (nearly a decade) what makes a difference is how people choose to live and how they choose to have their trauma hold power over them. What I mean by this is some trauma may be easier to control than others. Some experiences may make it's way back around only every now and then others may haunt you daily. Our brains will forever be rewired entirely by the trauma we have experienced throughout life especially from childhood. Our brains are at a constant growing pace at that time after all. It is possible to find ways to keep symptoms at bay that you might suffer from because of trauma but what shows is what you make of your life through it. For example, people that have children but have come from generations of toxicity and trauma. If you break the cycle, it ended with you- if not you continue it. It's going to vary person to person because each person will carry experiences differently. I hope this makes sense. Lastly, we do decide on how we will act towards other but one major detail that will bother us all is this: how were we meant to be if we didn't have to grow up so quickly? Who would we be is we weren't betrayed so young? Who would we be if it never happened? It's something none of us will never know. All we can do it try to be the best person we can be and accept that.

Plainly put, although it sounds cliche, its true... sometimes you need to be broken down to be rebuilt again.

One way to answer that question is to say that if you read one of the many biographies of people who have overcome the setbacks of an unhappy childhood, you'll see that there is indeed hope.

One of my favorites is that of Marsha Linehan. As a teenager, she was hospitalized for self-harm and diagnosed schizophrenic. Today, Dr. Linehan, founder of DBT, the best treatment for borderline personality disorder, is one of the world's most influential psychologists.

A therapist who specializes in trauma is best.

People here often mention the best-seller by psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk - The Body Keeps the Score.

As I said, biographies can be very helpful. You might want to read the autobiography of someone whose experience has been like yours. Search ""biographies childhood trauma.""

This is still absolutely fucked up and manipulative. To say he gave up on you.

2,"Hey friend, I want to let you know how much younger me can relate to this. And I want you to know it's going to be ok. 

First off, it is 10,000% normal and ok to want validation. We are all human beings just trying to find where we belong and how we relate to one another. I don't mean to negate the amount of stress you're feeling, but these questions are all normal questions.

The frequency and intensity is cause for concern, and the flipping back and forth is cause for concern. But if I can relate, and I see other commenters relating, you're still in good company :) 

What took me a long time to understand (esp with imposter syndrome / intrusive thoughts) is that there is a lot more gray in the world than black and white. I don't know if you're questioning your entire history as a person or maybe some recent events that happened. Regardless of the situation you are not infallible. And whenever trauma is involved it gets even messier. Btw the word ""trauma"" can be as small or large as you need it to be. A tiny paper cut is still trauma to the skin. 

No matter what, these types of ""was that abuse or did I mess up or do I want attention"" questions are muddy as heck. They will take time to sort through and you will never land on an answer you 100% like. But at some point you need to say to yourself something along the lines of ""I am a good person. I did my best with the situation/ I made a mistake. I am trying to grow and move forward. I refuse to give this situation any more thought time.""  --- it is NOT easy, and most of the time doesn't work, but once you've thought all your hard thoughts and battles there is ultimately nothing you can do about the past. The only way to move is forward - I say that with as much kindness as I can muster. Wishing you all the best bud xx",Aalleto,125xv58

The one thing I struggled with when I opened up to my closest friend about it was that I felt like I was lying and manipulating her to feel bad for me. The thing is that that trauma is very real and it explains a lot about why I am the way that I am. I found the reason I felt that way was for multiple reasons. The lack of self worth to trust yourself, not wanting the trauma to be trauma or real, your trauma was invalidated by someone so you think it’s not. Those are the reasons on why I could accept and believe my trauma. It’s a struggle that if you truly believe it doesn’t exist or is false, it will bring you down in another way than the trauma. The first thing you have to do to heal from the trauma is to accept that it’s there.

The brains aware of itself. In fact your situation is your brain overly aware, but it’s too complex, and not meant for your prefrontal to process it. The basics are, your senses feed you information, keep your focus on your environment, and “feel” it. Your brain will respond to the stimulus, these are instinctive responses. Then your consciousness is aware of your response to the sensing and you can decide/plan, what to do that’s beneficial, you move in that direction and “feel” more of the world. When there are traumas, or unsolved problems, the brain knows its a hindrance so it’ll dream to solve it (wonder), which you are doing but consciously to no end. And you feel the affects of that.

19,"For me, I spent years denying my trauma, then years questioning it.  Like you, I went back and forth and got stuck for a while in the process of trying to decide the 'truth'.   Here's what was really going on:  If the trauma/abuse didn't 'really' happen or didn't 'count' as such, then that meant I wasn't a victim, it wasn't that bad, and I could shame/blame myself for not handling my feelings better.   On the other hand, if the trauma/abuse did 'count' as such, then that meant I was a victim, it *was* that bad, and I wasn't ever in control, and I needed to ask for help.   

A large part of me had spent most of my life trying to discount, minimize, and outright deny that I'd been traumatized.   So that voice was in the back of my head shouting, ""It didn't happen!  Maybe it's false memories!  It wasn't that bad!""  Even today, after everything I know and all the recovery and healing work I've done (40+ years), there are still echoes of those old trauma responses.  For example, when my life is going well, a small apprehension grows that it can't last and something bad will happen.  When I read or hear about another trauma survivor's experience, a tiny voice urges me to compare their experience to my own so I can discount how bad it was for me.

For me, it was always about denial.  Coming out of denial meant softening, being vulnerable, facing pain and shame.  It meant taking risks, feeling unsure and unsafe for a time until I was healed enough to understand I could recover my personal self and power.

It's not uncommon for individuals to question their perception of reality when they've been through traumatic experiences or have grown up in an environment where their emotions and experiences were invalidated or dismissed.

Your desire for an external objective judgment may stem from a need for validation and confirmation of your experiences and emotions, which can help you feel heard and seen. It's important to recognize that seeking validation is a normal human need, and it doesn't make you spoiled or weak.

However, it's also important to recognize that seeking validation from external sources may not always provide the clarity or closure that you're looking for. Ultimately, you are the best judge of your experiences and emotions, and trusting yourself can be a valuable tool in your healing journey.

It might be helpful to continue working with a therapist or mental health professional to help you sort through these feelings and gain a deeper understanding of yourself. Therapy can also provide a safe space for you to explore and validate your emotions and experiences.

Remember that healing is a process, and it's okay to take the time you need to work through your experiences and emotions.

You actually put into words exactly what I’ve been ruminating on for the past year. Looking back on recent life experiences and connecting them to my childhood environment, I’m constantly asking myself if my feelings and interpretations of events are valid. Or if I’m just weak or seeking attention. This level of negative self talk, black and white thinking, and imposter syndrome are strong indicators of CPTSD and/or relational trauma.

Obsessing over your trauma and obsessing over its validity are all the proof you need that it is indeed trauma.

At 6:32am my mom enters my room and personally tells me happy birthday as it is the exact time I was born at. She makes me crepes for breakfast with nutella and we simply spend our day at the parc right around the corner. I never been a fan of having some big special occasions or gifts since very little so the serenity and peace it brought into my truly horrible childhood was all I truly wanted.

This is a true story and the only birthday I truly ever celebrated and enjoyed. It is, though, put in a much exxagerated poetic and artistic way but it is really exactly what happened. It is a memory I cherish a lot and it being my only birthday makes it for me the ideal one to my eyes.

Now, wanna do something fun with me? To make this birthday a little more memorable?

We could go around reddit, find people with birthdays,  and ask them about their happiest birthday memory and maybe add them too in our little quest? 

Spread that happiness you felt when you were 9 years old.

Bessel van der Kolk is the founder and medical director of the Trauma Research Foundation. People here often recommend his book The Body Keeps the Score.

If you go to the Amazon ad for The PTSD Sourcebook by Dr. Glenn Schiraldi, you'll see from the reader reviews that people with the disorder really appreciate this book, which says that there's a variety of symptoms associated with PTSD, some of which respond to self-help. For example, there's a simple but effective remedy for recurrent nightmares.

A psychologist named James Pennebaker has written a book on journaling as a treatment for trauma victims, Expressive Writing: Words That Heal. It's based on his clinical research.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsHIV9PxAV4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsHIV9PxAV4)

The trigger reaction is a fear reaction, a sense that you're in danger. A simple way to deal with a fear reaction when you're not in danger is to say to yourself ""It's OK - I'm safe"" and breathe slowly till you feel OK.

Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg, one of the research teams who have shown that breath work helps trauma victims, recommend this simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, inhale and exhale 6 seconds each.

A good habit - responding to a moment of stress by breathing slowly.

A study at Stanford (video, below) in which war veterans - some of whom had not been helped by other treatments - experienced anxiety brought down to normal levels after one week of slow breathing therapy, and good results a year later.

I am sorry you are having a tough time, i wish it was easy. But i can share whatever i know, yes it can be stress or trauma response. 

Now lets dive into the science of it, our responses are governed by our nervous system, try to regulate ur nervous system, try to reset vagus nerve, u will find lot of videos on this. And what works like magic is meditation. In the beginning it will be very hard
Bt try this : Meditate 5 mins for 3 times a day, then extend the time, try to calm urself down with butterfly hugs, do eft tapping. 

And i know its hard to go to a therapist bt still try. Remember however big the problem is there is always a solution.

When I was as kid, I almost drowned in a lake. I was terrified of pools and lakes after that. But I wanted to go to a pool party because I liked a girl and didn't want to be looked down upon. Facing my fear was strong.

I have a friend who is an alcoholic.  Despite the trouble alcohol has given them in their life, they still often really want a drink. Being able to resist an intense urge, be it unconscious or an addiction, is strong.

&#x200B;

In your case - you're terrified of other people. Yet you interact with people. Sometimes passively, sometimes angrily. But you interact. The reason is because you are human and we are social creatures. You're stuck in a war between the part of you that is in terror and the part of you that wants to connect with other people. The healthier choice is to connect, so every time you choose to interact, even if angrily, is an attempt to be healthy.

Part of your mind is in such turmoil that it believes suicide would be useful. But another part of your mind is saying no, I won't go for that. It knows the cost/benefit analysis is skewed and won't let you fall for the suicide story. That is healthy. That is strong.

That said, if you don't want to use the word 'strong' for someone who faces their terror, who struggles to somehow try to interact with others, and who does not accept a tempting resolution because they know deep down it is a mirage, that's fine. Find another word. But what ever you call it, a spade is a spade.",gramercygremlin,t8o6os

I'm also a coward. I've planned my suicide multiple times. Can never get around to it. What if I fail? What if I botch it too? How could I face anyone? My wife? My daughter?

Though that's not to say that there is absolutely no moving on from feeling a certain way.

I've been doing things on my own since I was a little girl. I get good grades, I'm on the honor roll and not to mention doing better academically out of both 9 and 10 grade classes and it's not enough.

I'm mentally exhausted but I get up everyday and do what I have to do and pretend like I'm okay, that I don't feel like giving up everyday and that I'm drowning. It's gotten so bad I turned to self harm for the first time and when I did it  because I thought it would take the pain away trust me it does only for a little while. I want to be a writer and motivational speaker but my dad told me that I wouldn't make it and to just give up. friends and family always tell me I don't need his support but that's what parents are for they are meant to support you through anything but he makes me feel like I'm a disappointment.

I haven't been sleeping, I can't eat, I've been staying up for hours either having a mental breakdown or just thinking where did everything all go wrong.

From random strangers on the street, sure. But OP is getting this from a therapist, who he pays for professional insight as to himself. So a therapist should be pointing out the good and the bad, even when client doesn't see it. It's literally their job. It's why you go to see them every week and tell them what you're thinking. So they can tell you what they think and see. Why would you pay a therapist to keep their thoughts to themselves??

Just because it causes a strong reaction in OP doesn't make it wrong. It doesn't sound like anyone actually invalidated OP. If anything, OP is invalidating himself. He's minimizing how much he's done/is doing because he doesn't feel like it's enough. But the therapist is encouraging him to recognize how hard he is fighting. The fact that he's in therapy at all is a sign of him doing great things for himself. Yet, people have a tendency to minimize their own successes and only focus on their perceived failures. The therapist is trying to shift that.

You have to try to consider their point of view or you're never going to start to believe the good things they're trying to instill in you. 

You don't have to agree with all of it. But maybe try it on for a few days before deciding it doesn't fit. Maybe when your therapist tells you something positive they see in you, don't immediately jump to trying to come up with a list of all the reasons they're wrong. Because all you're doing when you do that is beating yourself up, instead of even trying to be nice to yourself and consider the possibility that you're not as horrible as you think you are.

I guess I'm curious what you think therapy should do if not try to re-frame your thoughts to something less negative and distressing? If you're not open to a more positive self-esteem and you're not open to positive inspiration, what are you expecting therapy to do?

Source: A CSA “survivor”, that also lost a sibling young due to parental neglect, and, unfortunately, I’ve “survived” many more situations as well growing up…

I can’t speak for everyone (obviously), but I’ve always hated being called strong. I’m sure it helps a great many people, but as someone that had their first suicide attempt at age eight, this always made me feel worse. People respond to trauma in many different ways, and so often, I’m just trying to put one foot in front of the other that “strong” is one of the last words I’d use to describe myself. If I’m sharing my story with you, I’m looking for empathy and reassurance, or explaining why I can be distant, dislike being touched, except by a very select group of individuals, etc. “If it doesn’t kill you, it makes you stronger.” is such an annoying phrase to me, and being called strong just brings that to the forefront of my mind. Sometimes, I do feel strong, but most of the time I feel I’m fighting invasive thoughts, and doing my best not to pass my trauma to my wife and kids. (That are the best, and most understanding, and have probably saved me from the edge many, many times) What I’ve experienced isn’t a badge of honor for me, it is something I hope no one else ever has to experience.

Really the best thing I’ve found that helps is listening and having someone reassure me that they are still there for me. (And from the select few that can be in that circle, a reassuring hug) Beyond that, it’s doing your best to read the situation and respond accordingly.

Also, I’d like to add that the “Men get raped, too…” argument is something else that irks the heck out of me. Usually, it is used to justify toxic things like rape jokes, or to counterpoint a female’s point. (Usually on whether to take an accusation seriously) I will almost always side with other victims. I also generally hate the rating of trauma, as well. I’ve been through a lot, more than some, less than others, but my trauma is no more or less valid.

Saying you're strong is actually the opposite. It's saying, ""yeah, this sucks. And also, you're still here when you could have given up, and that IS doing something. It might not be something you asked for. Being strong might not be something you should have to do. But you're doing it and you deserve recognition for it.""

Saying that you aren't strong or that you ""aren't doing anything"" is what minimizes trauma. Because then you're saying that you haven't had to struggle or fight. Which is obviously not the case, since OP feels like it's a constant fight. 

But at the end of the day, therapists are there to shift you to more positive thinking. That's their job. People seek therapy because they're in distress and want to be happier. A therapist that is fine just keeping you stuck in and validating your negative thought spirals isn't doing therapy at all. So no, a therapist should never say ""this happened for a reason"" because that's super invalidating, but they absolutely should be pointing out the positive things and pointing you in a direction of strength-based approaches and positive self-esteem.

Since the original is practically total shit that nobody asked for, a great bonus is that *nobody* would ever complain about me ""ruining their childhood"". My team and I could have near total creative domination over an abandoned IP and only the higher executives would give a fuck.

It's all good. We all deal with things differently and in our own way. If I could ever give any advice as someone in his 30s now with a lifetime of trauma, it's this. 

Sometimes, things cant be fixed. Sometimes we need to accept some things are broken and learn how to push forward regardless. It's the acceptance that's the hardest part. 

I always thought therapy was about trying to fix things, but I've come to realise it's about closing chapters not rewriting them. I don't want to be told I'm strong or weak because of my past. I don't even want to be told I can have a better future.

I need to be given the tools to somehow be made to believe that on my own account. Yeah, sometimes there are days where getting out of bed is a massive uphill struggle. Where facing reality just seems impossible and daunting and miserable.

Sure, it's a weakness. Everyone has weaknesses. But whenever you talk to a person anyway, that is being strong. 

A strong person isn't a person with no weaknesses. A strong person is a person who has weaknesses and hardships and keeps going anyway. Your therapist isn't telling you that none of those struggles exist. Your therapist is pointing out all the things you're struggling with, and giving you praise for continuing to fight your weaknesses. 

The fact that you're in therapy, trying to overcome this, THAT is what makes you strong. Because let me tell you, there's a lot of people that don't even make it to that point. People who don't even try or want to try. The fact that you're determined to try is what makes you strong, and yet you completely discredit that. You treat yourself like you've done nothing. 

The way out of the pattern is to acknowledge that. To give yourself some damn credit for the hard work you're doing. Right now, you're like the awful coach who just constantly tells yourself you're failing no matter how hard you try. But nobody learns well in that environment. A supportive coach is what gives people the motivation to keep trying and getting better. So stop criticizing yourself constantly. You need to learn to give yourself positive reinforce too. When you get to a therapy session, you acknowledge that you've done a good thing for yourself.

I don’t have ADHD and I’m not on the autism spectrum, but I do know that trauma is a shitty thing to have, and it effects daily life in ways only you, the trauma-bearer, can see. I don’t know how to fix it, I’m still a young man and hardly have anything figured out, but I’m here standing with you mamas. You’ll figure it out and learn it one day, I know you will. Give yourself time, and give yourself some credit. You’re strong 🫶🏽🫵🏽",BoxValuable5096,1b97yma

2,"Honestly, something that’s helped me be better at speaking is spending time taking care of myself. I’ve found it slightly easier to say things that may feel uncomfortable, to call somebody out or even just say hello to a stranger. Now loving yourself may sound cliche, and it’s not a cure-all to social anxiety. But when you become more comfortable with yourself and confident in yourself, and realize that you have incredible value as a human being, day-by-day it becomes a little easier to speak.

A way I’ve been able to get myself to speak a little easier is by reflecting on myself and really thinking about what I want as a person. Like for example. I used to not be able to go back up to the counter if a restaurant got my order wrong. Or if my family was yelling at me for something trivial. Once I took the time to realize that I deserve to have the correct order that I placed and spent money on, or that as a person, I don’t deserve to be disrespected by my own family, it helped me become a little more confident and it translated to more words being able to come out. Think of speaking as fighting for yourself, it’s going to be hard, but you have to do it sometimes to love yourself. 

Now I’m not saying it’s easy, I’ve had to force myself to talk a lot. I used to have a phobia of phone calls (and I still do somewhat), but the way somebody I was close with told me was that the more I do it, the easier it will get.

Sounds a little silly, but for speaking, practice helps a lot. Now I don’t mean try to practice and go over every possible outcome/response to a situation; that’s just going to lead to overthinking and it’s not constructive. Instead, practice physically placing your body in awkward situations, practice moving your feet to walk over to that person you want to and then that will be the baby steps to bigger things like speaking, which is a lot more stressful 
 mentally.

Either way, you just gotta love yourself and know that your voice is powerful. You have to use it as a tool to love yourself and I want you to realize that you’re important and your words/opinions have value. You just gotta keep trying to build it gradually, and maybe even take a speech class. Anyway, it won’t happen over night, but I know you’ll get there eventually. 🤞🏽

Also sorry for the rant lol",BoxValuable5096,1b97yma
0,"I sympathize with you heavily, simply because i’ve gone through the same thing. Though it could have been much, much, worse i’ve had a pretty rough childhood and situations that I had to carry over my shoulders from a young age. The first thing i would suggest, is going to therapy. Having someone to talk to and unpack the trauma with will help you more than you think — you might even learn new things about yourself in the process. The second is trying to shift your thoughts. which is MUCH easier said than done, but after going to therapy and unpacking everything with a therapist, being able to shift your thought may become a lot easier. It’ll take time and it won’t happen overnight, but it’s worth a try. Your campus might even provide therapists. I would look into it if i were you :)",strbrybb,1bkpbtr

2,"oh hey, i have something similar. After i was assaulted at 15, I developed kinks for choking, and some submissive behaviors. Although they aren’t exact same as what happened to me, it’s the act of being submissive and told what to do as an effect of being a situation where i was told what to do. I don’t personally have an issue or shame with it, I frame it as a way to take my power back. I’m consenting to someone treating me that way. 

However, if it’s causing you to feel shameful or dirty after, it’s definitely worth bringing up with a therapist. It could be self destructive, or it could be something you need to reframe / change your thought process on. I know it’s hard to bring up, but i promise they’ve heard far worse.

4,"(Not a therapist) An ex of mine and myself each had our own separate kinks that both stemmed from sexual assault. I think it boils down to control. For example when a person is sexually assaulted they are not in control of that situation.

Idk if this is specifically what you're feeling but I'm just using it as an example.

>I am too embarassed to bring this up with a therapist.

The theory behind that is the person associates sex with ""living"" and will engage in all kinds of sexual activity to confirm being alive.

There are lots of therapists out there, and some even specialize in this (sex/sexuality/sexual healing after a sexual trauma). If you do decide to talk to a therapist, I do highly recommend finding someone who is at least trauma-informed. Talking to someone about not only sex but also trauma takes a LOT so the fact that you’re thinking about it is amazing.

Most of the time the stuff that you are uncomfortable taking about are the exact things you should be talking about. You limit your progress by hiding things and will feel much better having those things off your chest. And it gives your therapist a better idea of what bothers you and can help you more effectively as a result.

As an example. I recently came to terms with the fact that I felt almost no grief for my older brothers death years ago. I felt like a monster for this and felt like I couldn't bring it up to my therapist because I feared him labeling me as a sociopath. But I did anyway and he was able to diagnose a trait in me that helped me better understand why I felt that way.

I always have mixed feelings when I look up porn that is even remotely reminiscent of the trauma I have, but I don’t think it’s a bad thing.

You might be interested to know that a LOT of people have these fetishes without ever having experienced trauma.

The reason for that fetish is simply that fear and feeling unsafe meanwhile consciously knowing that you ARE safe makes things exiting (similar to bungee jumping- you know that you'll be fine, but it's still an exciting thrill).

It might also have something to do with that it's ""forbidden"", similar to why people like anal or public stuff.

Long story short, you shouldn't feel ashamed by it and maybe find a Dom that you can trust to act out some of those fantasies (as long as you feel comfortable and have a safe word).

You brain doesn't know that the abuse is over. It doesn't know that the traumatic event is over.

I think many people misunderstand that trauma always has to be directly related to a very specific event, which is not necessarily the case (only important when diagnosing PTSD but not that much outside of it). You mentioning emotional trauma definitely fits better. 

One way or another, I don’t think it’s necessarily crucial to put a label on it. Fact is that you experienced a very stressful time in your life that manifested into cognitive and behavioral symptoms (which seemed to have had quite the impact on your wellbeing). Also, being in this constant fight or fight mode is extremely draining.

Due to a lot of bullying, people saying that i shouldnt talk about my problems, that i need to do it myself etc etc i am now trying to help a lot of people with their problems since a lot of them dont have someone to talk too and i want to help people realize they dont need to it alone.

But for the bad is that those things caused me to be very insecure, very closed off about my problems and more caring about the others and also neglecting myself.

In short, yes, it is possible that you have trauma, but could also be very severe anxiety. I would also like to say that all trauma is valid no matter how trivial it may seem. This can even be trauma caused by the anxiety, like if you are having many panic attacks, you begin to fear having more panic attacks. That is a trauma response.

0,"Hey friend, 

So if you don't have any memories of sexual abuse it can be shaky territory to try to ""find out"" if you do. I spent years knowing I acted like a traumatized person, had every single response in the book, but I still somehow couldn't figure out why I was like that. I thought maybe I had been sexually abused. I was a precocious child, it made sense... 

But, I wasn't sexually abused. What I was though... was seriously emotionally neglected. I freak out and freeze up even when someone holds my HAND. Oh my god physical intimacy can be so hard for people like us who don't know what receiving good healthy love feels like. Really, its no wonder why you have such visceral reactions to a partner who clearly loves you and is gentle towards you. Love can feel like a threat to your safety if you've never felt it. 

I'm not saying you were never sexually abused, I am not you. I can't know if you were or not. What I am saying however is many times, we try to look in ""hidden"" places for things that might have happened because maybe those are things that could explain something. But I've found more often, our pain hides in plain sight. The reason I acted like someone with sexual trauma even though I didn't have any was because I quickly viewed sex as a way to feel wanted by someone. The reason innocent physical touches scare me to death is because I'm not used to touches that mean something from someone who doesn't want anything from me except to be loved back. That's foreign territory to me, even as an adult. 

I'm sorry you're experiencing this. You deserve to be loved by someone who, when the only time they ever put a hand on you, is to show you how loved and deserving of softness you truly are.",Similar-Hold-3646,18fmiho

Allow yourself to feel bad about it. Don’t get stuck feeling bad, I mean give yourself permission to feel. Be honest with it. Validate yourself. If it bothers you, its important.

3,"Hi there, Social Worker here.

I'd like to ask you, where you ever given the cold shoulder or silent treatment as punishment or did others around you expirence perceived preferential treatment ever?

If so, this can constitute ""emotional neglect"" which is very damaging to most mammalion psyches. What you're describing as a ""privilege"" of direct maltreatment can at times be regulating for people. Emotionally we get used to people attacking us, and we react in kind with many different behaviors thoughts and feelings. Predictable ones, we fight back, we freeze, we fawn we initiate a bid to control the interaction.

Neglect is different. 

Neglect can signal to our limbic system that we aren't even worthy of attention. 

That we are unseen. 

If we take humans and stick them in the forest and we're around the campfire and someone loses track of you, it's dangerous. You could get lost, not have your basic needs met or get attacked or die alone.

 It's dangerous to be socially shunned. Real or perceived your brain interprets it the same.

What exhibits usually from neglect is a direct immediate impulsive demand for being seen. Frustration, anger, sadness, etc... Self harm is one.... Dogs do the same thing left alone outside chanied up for a long time, they will often gnaw on their paws. 

Finding someone to work a cognitive process out with to be able to casually tell people out loud, ""hey if I feel ignored it kind of bums me out."" And when you feel the feeling you say, ""hey I know it's nothing and I'm feeling that ignored feeling right now."" Might be a quick way to take up space and be casual about how you feel. Repeat to yourself ""I'm safe, I'm seen"". Or something. 

The opposite of forward movement looks like applying the vigilance of a situation inward. When we ""compare"" or are ""hypervigilant"" of other people we now are paradoxically noticing that we are compared to not being noticed, we are attempting to control the narrative by taking it out on ourselves. 

We're trying to divide the whole interaction by zero and take it on ourselves. We'll tell ourselves stories that aren't real. ""This person hates me, they think im dumb, etc....i hate myself.. noone EVER notices me...."" 

Eventually this robs others of being able to respond to us like we'd actually like to be treated. You deserve to be noticed. Nothing wrong with that. 

I hope you find freedom from this worry and you seek a professional to visit with. This one can be hard to do alone.

14,"Thank you so much for stopping by and writing this, its very thorough and insightful. You have no idea how much this helps me. 
As for the type of the silent treatment, it needs a little explanation.
Me and my other sibling at the time were living with our parents, and because of our family’s social group we were always being watched for our behaviour. When we both (or even just one of us) slightly failed to behave the way they wanted us to, we would get these sessions of getting talked down to or getting yelled at for an hour or so and then were sent to our rooms to think it out. The main reason why I always feel like I’m ungrateful is because they could’ve done so much worse than emotional berating in those sessions. They never really did other than once or twice.
So I found myself crying the other day because someone gave me the cold shoulder, and I realized then thats what I’ve always hated the most. Instead of clear communication there’s just nothing. Its “get out of my sight and don’t make too much noise otherwise I’ll start another session” rather than “I’m your parent and I’m responsible for helping you become a better human”.
Having to deal with feeling like shit afterwards when they went on about their lives watching TV, eating, reading a book, or even going to bed was the worst of it. I feel thats were the self harm must have developed, as a coping mechanism to a broken emotional regulation system.

Well, if you want, you can start with me. I've been following the subject of narcissism/children of narcissistic parents for a few years, and I guide and help close friends who have parents like that too xD

You seem to have very good self-awareness, and you also go to therapy, that's half a step.

About being able to trust new people, make new friends, why don't you try starting with your friends' friends? You can ask them to introduce their friends to you, thus expanding your circle of friends. As your friends understand your situation, they will certainly help you with this.

Another point, I don't think you should be afraid to open up to people for fear of being judged. Of course, this doesn't mean exposing your life completely to anyone in 5 minutes of conversation, but by telling your story little by little, I'm sure most people will understand.

Most people have no idea what it's like to be the child of narcissistic parents, but at the same time you will be scared by how many people have the same problem as you. Regardless of whether or not you have knowledge, if the person has a minimum of empathy, they will understand your suffering, and will not judge you negatively for it.

Perhaps this blockage is much more a shame that you feel than a real risk of being misunderstood or judged. In other words, it is much more something in your mind than a real risk.

And finally, you can make lemonade out of lemons. Talking about this subject, sharing this with people, I consider it very important, as it can help people who suffer from this without knowing it, to know what it is. It can also help people who don't suffer from it, but can identify in advance if they get into a situation where they have to deal with it.

In my country, there is a therapist who did this. She herself had an abusive childhood due to her mother, and when she discovered this, she aimed to study the subject in depth, and take her knowledge and experiences to help other people going through the same thing. Who knows, maybe you could do something similar in the future.

5,"Trauma affects the way we see things, which includes the way we see ourselves. 



Trauma can make people's environments seem more threatening than they really are, which can make trauma survivors feel that their coping and problem-solving skills are not good enough. 



Sometimes, people blame themselves for their traumas.



There are resources for helping with trauma. You are a resource. Remember what you've accomplished and don't dwell on your failures.



You say that you have been suffering from anxiety and at times difficulty breathing.



Psychology Today online says that Dr. David Carbonell is a clinical psychologist who specializes in treating fears and phobias and the author of three self-help books, including Panic Attacks Workbook. Dr. Carbonell says that the way to breathe during a panic attack is slowly, using the big muscle under the stomach. Put a hand on your belly to feel it go out when you inhale.



A good exercise - breathe gently through the nose, 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out.

9,"I wish I could open up. I don't tell anybody anything. Sometimes I want to, but I don't really know if it would make a difference. I also have social anxiety, but you would never know it. I just learned to talk a bunch of nonsense like everyone else. I hate small talk, but I learned how to be good at it so people don't think I'm weird.  I'm horrible with both names and faces so I have to pretend like I remember people when I meet them for the fourth or fifth time.

All these skills took years to master. My parents taught me absolutely nothing especially because I lived with my mom only half my childhood. I haven't seen my biological dad since I was 6, but he was never around anyways. So I spent rest of my childhood living with friends and family. The school I was attending gave me an IQ test when I was 14. I don't know what the point was. My tested IQ was 140. This made me feel like I was better than everyone else. You don't make a lot of friends that way. It took years to convince myself that I'm not better than everyone else, or at least to not behave that way. I always tell my kids that it doesn't matter how smart you are, it's all about achievement - aka Forrest Gump.

I'm all kinds of broken inside. I don't let anyone get close enough. I have no close friends. In fact, I haven't made a friend since college. My wife knows how broken I am. We're separated now after she put up with me for almost 20 years. That's a long time. I love her so much for having put up with me for that long. My 13 year is currently undergoing treatment for her eating disorder. It's all my fault because of my obsession with diet and exercise. She hates me now. This really breaks my heart, but I have so much experience in blocking out bad things, I don't even cry even though I want to. My 14 year old seems to be doing ok, but she doesn't really tell me much. I think it's normal for a teenager.

Anyhow, there I go again ranting, thinking my problems are bigger than everyone else's. Sorry. I really do wish that I could be a better person. I have gotten much, much better, but I wish I had been like this 20 or 30 years ago.",cahrens2,1cigguf

1,"I can't relate to the rape, but I feel you on the part about being alone. My father used to beat me real bad when I was 7 or 8 up to about 10. I never told anyone, because I thought that if I took the beatings, and just did what he said, then he wouldn't beat my siblings, who were younger than me. I never had good father figures at all. I have an abusive stepdad who married my mom when I was 8. Sever alchoholic. I never had anybody I trusted enough to talk to. I was very cynical. I was cold. I still am a bit. Every new person I met. I would be nice and charismatic and calm, but all I was doing was reading the kind of person you were, because my brain was telling me that you're a possible threat. I was diagnosed with CPTSD when I was 13 or 14. Im also Schizoaffective, which started around 10. I never spoke about my trauma for years. Then, when I realised I was physically a man, at around 14, all this fear I had for years turned into rage. I didn't get scared anymore, only angry. I took it out on everyone. I then started working through it, and focusing on that instead of my psychosis. I've had so many talks with therapists. I always thought that the stuff I endured as a child was normal. Every one of them said something along the lines of this being a lot of trauma compared to others. Mind you I haven't included a lot in here, and don't plan to. They all would say  ""Why didn't you talk to someone sooner? This wouldn't be as much of a problem if you did."" I would then tell them how I didn't know I was supposed to. I was raised by abusive men who told me to keep it all inside. Told me not to express it. I never learned that you can't suppress it. Especially not with how I am. Doesn't matter if I'm only a little angry at something. If I let that anger out, it turns into full blown rage. I've figured out how to bottle it for a short while until I'm somewhere I can express it. My main problem with how tv portrays trauma amongst men? It shows most of them going to a bar, and drinking some whiskey, or something. It shows them ""suppressing it"", and never blowing up. It shows them being these calm rational people in the most intense of situations. My problem? That is what I thought I was supposed to do with mine. I started drinking, and doing drugs. I suppressed it, and then got into a LOT of fights as a kid. I was horrible. I wasn't fighting you because you called me some name. I was fighting you because I wasted to see you bleed. I wanted to see you bleed because I was projecting my shitty father figures onto you. What I will say? When you have all that trauma, and you carry it around everywhere you go? I don't know about others, but I thrive under stress. The only good thing that came out of those bad coping habits. All of which I learned from tv, because nobody taught me how to properly express my emotions. I'm doing much better nnowadays. I kicked a bad pill addiction I have about a year or two ago. I can safely drink one or two beers, but I avoid it unless I'm celebrating something, or just relaxing. I don't smoke weed to deal with my shit anymore. I still vape, but I'm working on that too. It is just horrible to think. There might be some kid just like I was. Nobody there for him. Then, he watches some tv, and sees it displayed how I did. I suffered because of it, and its awful to think there might be another kid out there who will experience the same thing all over again.",NickVIMM,170mpet

If you want a form of media that does not romanticize trauma, I suggest [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/), by Wildbow. It's a webnovel about a girl who suffers immense bullying and uses her superpowers as a form of scapism. Powers in Worm represent trauma. They aren't a blessing and often powers can lead to more trauma in a violent and viscious cycle. Trauma in Worm is always treated with realism, care, and properly impacts characters throughout the book.

Do note the book is heavy, has a lot of trigger warnings, and exactly one instance of implicit rape (i.e. not on screen and not described in any way, and it's not a major plot point, and is treated with a lot of care). Some people found Worm to be weirdly therapeutic because of how events unfold and how much care the author deals with the subject, but of course there are plenty of people who don't want so much heavy shit in their media.

0,"Hello all. This was a question that was a bit out of place I think amongst this thread. I was recently reminded of it though, and decided to give chatgpt the question. I've since also read some things about Triggers in general. All in all, I liked chatgpt's advice on the subject and thought I'd share it. Really, this is just a sort of general advice for dealing with triggers, only applied to books. I'm not sure if this would be helpful for someone, but I figured I'd throw it in here anyways.

ChatGPT:

I'm truly sorry to hear that you're experiencing such challenges, and it's understandable that certain themes in literature can evoke difficult emotions, especially when they resonate with personal traumas. It's positive that you find catharsis in reading, but it's crucial to manage those moments when it becomes overwhelming. Here are a few suggestions that might help:

1. **Self-awareness:** Recognize and accept your triggers. Being aware of what elements in literature may cause distress allows you to be more prepared.
2. **Set boundaries:** Give yourself permission to put a book down or take a break if it becomes too overwhelming. Your well-being is the top priority.
3. **Choose carefully:** Before starting a new book, consider researching its themes to ensure it aligns with your comfort level. You can use book reviews or summaries for this purpose.
4. **Mindfulness techniques:** Practice mindfulness or grounding techniques when you feel triggered. Techniques like deep breathing, focusing on your senses, or using positive affirmations can help.
5. **Seek support:** Consider discussing your feelings with a friend, family member, or a mental health professional. Having someone to share your thoughts and experiences with can provide valuable support.
6. **Explore alternative genres:** If intense themes consistently trigger distress, explore genres that are less likely to contain such elements. This way, you can still enjoy reading without encountering triggering content.

Remember, your well-being is paramount, and it's okay to take steps to protect yourself emotionally. If the challenges persist, seeking guidance from a mental health professional can provide personalized support and coping strategies.

&#x200B;

Edit:

Some other things I thought about is that I can indeed see a lot of the triggers coming, if I'm perfectly honest. Things like major physical assualt or sexual assault I can either see coming or catch at the start and just skip over it if I need it. There is a completionist part of me that might have some trouble not knowing some details, but I just wanted to throw in that this is also an option that is particularly suited for books, you know?",RetroHipsterGaming,18gw00q

If you go to the Amazon ad for The PTSD Sourcebook by Dr. Glenn Schiraldi, you'll see from the reader reviews that people with the disorder really appreciate this book, which says that there's a variety of symptoms associated with PTSD, some of which respond to self-help. For example, there's a simple but effective remedy for recurrent nightmares.

A psychologist named James Pennebaker has written a book on journaling as a treatment for trauma victims, Expressive Writing: Words That Heal. It's based on his clinical research.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsHIV9PxAV4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsHIV9PxAV4)

The trigger reaction is a fear reaction, a sense that you're in danger. A simple way to deal with a fear reaction when you're not in danger is to say to yourself ""It's OK - I'm safe"" and breathe slowly till you feel OK.

Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg, one of the research teams who have shown that breath work helps trauma victims, recommend this simple exercise - breathe gently through the nose, inhale and exhale 6 seconds each.

A good habit - responding to a moment of stress by breathing slowly.

A study at Stanford (video, below) in which war veterans - some of whom had not been helped by other treatments - experienced anxiety brought down to normal levels after one week of slow breathing therapy, and good results a year later.

You recognized that the best time you had was being away from your family, but you are most concerned about who will be responsible for your sister when you are gone.

The therapist should have a responsibility to take care of it only if they are aware of it, you could ask to she if she would let you join one of her sessions and bringing your concerns up? Not all therapists will do this, and it's common practice to take the side of the client, but it could help. If the cops are aware of it, it's also possible to consider making her go to a rehab center. Institutions aren't the best as far as I know, but again it's not your responsibility alone. Getting other responsible people in your sister's life to take care of her socially can also lighten your burden.

With time that thing would develop in \*trauma\*, you would always think that you re wrong, even when you don t have anything to do with the sitution.  
Think of when it started or things from your past that might be the reason.",OniGeolini,1c4qsoc
0,"I’m sorry. Even though digging in and acknowledging the bad stuff is an important step, it sort of tears off that bandaid and stirs up bad and painful memories, it’s all fresh again and it can be overwhelming. You said they weren’t “always that bad,” but it was bad enough. And terribly hurt people can be terribly hurtful to others. Just because it wasn’t constant, it was still abusive, at least from what I’ve read of your description. I don’t have anything magical to say other than it’s normal to almost re-experience it all again, but it’s unfortunately part of the process of healing. It’s going to hurt. Give yourself some grace and try not to beat yourself up. This will pass. I hope you have another appointment coming up soon so you can express how it affected you. Maybe finally expressing the truth has unburied the stuff. You have survived this, even if you feel like crap right now. I’m not in a healthy place either so it’s funny to be trying to make someone else feel better, but I know what emotional pain is like and I hate to see others experience it.

There are two sides to the coin when it comes to codependency. You have the person who is dependent on the other person and you have the person who that person is dependent on. And that person puts their needs second to those of the person who’s dependent on them….hence, taking care of them.

It can cause issues with my relationships because I forget that for others, listening to people vent is laborious and drains them.  For me, that's how I recharge.

1,"I struggle with this as well with my “trauma”. In my opinion, trauma is very subjective and different for everyone. If it’s traumatic to you, then it’s traumatic. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Unless they are you and experienced it in your body and mind, don’t let people tell you it’s not extreme enough. If people who aren’t close to you (i.e.: people on the Internet, acquaintances) tell you otherwise, just remind yourself that they don't know your story (fully) and they're not in your shoes.",danica_kristine,fr3hp9
2,"That's a very normal reaction to trauma. As someone who has PTSD and has been through years of trauma therapy, trauma is the effect a situation has on you. Not the situation itself. It takes an ""extreme"" situation to create a trauma response, but the definition of extreme is pretty subjective and varies a lot from person to person. It's also perfectly normal to compare your trauma to others and see yourself as inadequate. It's a defense mechanism; your brain is trying to convince itself you're safe and this is no big deal so that it can protect itself in the future. The downside of that is that it makes you think your suffering doesn't count. It does though! You can put two traumatized people together and they'll probably both do it. Let's say one was in a terrible car accident and the other was a child abuse victim. The accident victim might say, ""at least mine was over quickly, I can't imagine having it happen over and over"" while the abuse victim may think, ""at least I knew what to expect, imagine having it happen out of nowhere."" The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Or in this case the trauma is always worse. In truth there's no such thing as worse. It doesn't *matter* what anyone else went through. Everyone deserves appropriate care. Does the fact that I was abused somehow make your traumatic experience not have happened? Or in some way preclude you getting treatment? No, it's irrelevant to your situation. You have the same needs regardless of what I or anyone else is going through.  


Just so you know you're not alone though, I struggled with this a *lot*. Part of my trauma involved my mom dismissing the abuse as no big deal. And the first psychiatrist I asked about PTSD told me it didn't count because my abuser was disabled and therefore I should have protected myself better. Which sounds *insane* to me now, dude should not be practicing psychiatry, and every doctor/therapist since then I've told about that has been appalled. But at the time I accepted it at face value because it fit the narrative I'd already been stuck in. Learning to accept that my trauma is trauma has taken years, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't still have my doubts. But it does get better, it just takes time and effort.",Karaethon22,fr3hp9

5,"I feel you on this. I was assaulted a few years ago after being drugged in a club but because I wasn’t sexually assaulted and was blacked out due to the drugs so I didn’t remember most of the attack, I never really considered it trauma despite the fact I woke up in the hospital with a busted face and need to get dental work done.

Years later in therapy, I finally realized that I did in fact experience trauma and that’s part of the reason I subconsciously would get so anxious taking public transportation. 

Also, I have a textbook amazing mother but also, she had a habit of getting drunk and being verbally abusive when I was younger. Because she was always giving me what I wanted, volunteered at school, and would take us on vacations, it took me a long time to understand that what she said when drunk was still traumatic.

Point being, I think anything that effects you personally to a point that you’re able to recall it and feel negatively about whatever you experienced can be considered traumatic. There are different degrees to trauma but it’s still ultimately trauma.",splattertaint,fr3hp9

7,"Trauma can make me feel invalidated allll the time especially because it's not ""typical"" trauma. When neurotypical people hear trauma/PTSD they think of veterans, people that have been severely abused in their childhoods, sexual assault. Pretty horrific stuff but trauma is actually really easy for someone to get. Screaming at a child, ""spanking"", name calling, constant nitpicking behaviour, someone constantly asserting dominance/control over you. I have been sexually molested in my childhood but it wasn't the typical feelings of trauma; i had no negative feelings about it. My behaviour/subconscious though has effected me into a hypersexual and I have an strong infatuation about sex. My behaviour has also been negatively affected (social anxiety) due to my mum treating me like shit. Also, I had an extremely traumatic one time experience that has left me with a severe trigger around cats that leaves me nauseous and gives me flashbacks for weeks on end at worst, sometimes I trigger myself due to my imagination. That's the worst of my trauma. I feel like I don't have it bad enough to say I'm traumatised because of others stories, like, I have no right to be mad because people deal with similar things and just suck it up and move on.

I'm a lot better concerning my parents now, but guess what?, the traumas I'm remembering right now are mere freaking comments, looks, facial expressions, being misunderstood, someone taking my position in a queue, some irrelevant things with 0 effect on normal people, I can assure you a mere comment on the internet got me to a place very dark, sadly I think it was darker where I was back when I was mentally abused by my father.

11,"Trauma is harm (physical, emotional, and/or spiritual) experienced while in a state of powerlessness to protect oneself and/or others. 

Abuse is a subset, or type, of trauma. Abuse is harm that is caused by the actions - or INaction - of a human to another livng creature. 

We are ""hardwired"" to respond very quickly to any perceived traumatic harm. We don't have conscious choice to how our brain and body reacts to trauma in real time. Our amygdala (the brain's ""smoke detector"") when functioning properly, fires off warning bells whenever we are at risk of harm. In short term situations (the tree branch in our peripheral vision causes us to flinch because it might be a snake) this response is quickly resolved and doesn't cause lingering issues. However when we experience powerlessness in chronic, ongoing way, it can lead to longer term neurological, behavioral, and physical impacts. If we perceive the world as a constant source of risk and harm, we can struggle with anxiety disorders, depression, and a host of other disorders. 

Part of the reason trauma is so poorly understood is because it is poorly defined. This is a problem that all the trauma experts (a few former heads of the APA Division of Trauma Psychology)  I've spoken and collaborated with acknowledge. The APA, and through them the DSM, have failed to yet develop a helpful definition of trauma for the general public. 

Source: I'm a SME on trauma, sexual abuse, and recovery that was the Executive Director of a non-profit for SA survivors for a number of years.

My patient might consider an incident when they were 7  involving an unmet expectation of  getting a letter in the mail on a Tuesday vs. a Wednesday, and that they found this very traumatic. Further review would reveal there are no other details or issues with this event. 

My position as a clinician is not to argue with the patient on the trauma. In the objective sense, is this event REALLY a traumatic event, if we’re comparing between things, then no. But that’s not the point. 

What we really want to know is why they are traumatized, vs. arguing the validity of the trauma.

I have bits and pieces of my life that I would never wish on anyone and all those pieces of my life stitched together impacted my mental health so much and gave me “trauma”. I remember when I was 13, I had to hold my drunk and aggressive mother down to the ground while calling 911 because I was scared of what she would do to me. I got her arrested. But I couldn’t tell anyone about it or mention it because she got it taken off her record, so I held it all inside of me. Fast forward to freshman year of high school. There was a boy in my class who was a senior. I didn’t like him and he would always say sexual jokes around me and he would creep me out. He grabbed my butt so many times. I was in the back of a classroom and he came up behind me and groped me under my butt and thigh and wouldn’t let go of me. I hated him. I started self harming to cope because no body believed anything I said about him because everyone “loved him”. The rest of the year my anxiety spiraled out of control. I had other guys grab my butt in the hallway throughout the year. I would wear oversized and baggy layered clothes to keep them from even touching me but they wouldn’t stop. No one believed me, so I held all my feelings inside of me. Fast forward to junior year. I sat at lunch with a boy who was isolating cause he looked like he needed a friend. He was a bit odd but I didn’t think much of it until a month later he followed me home and to work from school every day taking creepy pictures of me. I was so scared all the time. I was always looking behind my back. I flinched at the smallest noises or movements. I constantly hid away in the hallways at school cause I was so scared of running into him. I would lock myself in the bathroom stall rocking back and forth and shaking and crying because I was so scared. I kept getting horrible flashbacks of everything. I don’t remember a day that I wasn’t scared. He manipulated for me so long, even swallowed a whole bottle of pills because I didn’t love him. Later found out that he was a huge neo nazi and would dance in his room in a nazi suit to the nazi Germany music. He made me so sick. I was so scared, I had lunch in the same period as him and I stopped eating lunch cause I was scared of running into him. I was so occupied with my racing thoughts, reactions, and I was too depressed to even think about eating meals. Later on I developed an eating disorder. I still struggle with it.

It makes a difference if it's an angry boss saying it after you arrived late to work, an abusive parent when you're feeling vulnerable, or a trusted friend when you're going through a divorce.

So many people I've met struggle with ""this isn't serious enough"". ""Enough"" is a really pointless thing to question because the follow up is ""enough for what?"". Enough to deserve to heal? Enough to look at? Enough to talk to a therapist about?",chocolatefingerz,fr3hp9
38,"But if you dont treat a paper cut properly it can get infected and fester and become bigger problems. And an amputation can heal without complications, and you can get supports and prosthetics that allow you to live a normal life.

39,"Thank you so much for sharing this. I consider myself emotionally neglected as a child, but I definitely also had trauma I feel uncomfortable calling trauma. Things like my father forcing me to exercise because “yoga doesn’t count”—leading me to literally not be able to stand any exercise besides yoga. 

I do think constant emotional invalidation and criticism is a form of abuse. We are all supposed to be loved unconditionally, but when you don’t even feel comfortable expressing negative emotions because your parents don’t know how to handle them (or teach you how to), it is extremely damaging. However, I honestly doubt anyone on the outside would look into my life and believe me, because both my parents are intelligent narcissists who can manipulate the conversation however they want. I wish people believed victims over abusers..",FiguringItOut--,fr3hp9
40,"Wow. You described perfectly my childhood with these two traumatised persons. I was abused since practicly birth till i broke final contact with my father (or rather sperm donor) and when I was four both my mother and brother died in a car crash where I was inside the car followed by eight years of social exclusion from pretty much everyone my age. Theres a lot of other things that happened to but yk...life sometimes is just full of justice (dripping in sarcasm)
Even though I acknowledge people with half the shit as traumatised its hard to accept for myself. I have always known I was different. Still I think ""well but they where abused longer than I was"" or ""but i don't even remember that much so it can't be that bad, right?"" or ""but see? They where bullied so much more aggressively""
I think you are right with the statement that its a mechanism of our brain to calm us down but also something we get taught by our surroundings. From when I was little  I saw other people get called out as drama queens and, while I have to agree with most of these statements, it manifests a thinking in my head of ""don't be like that, don't be a drama queen, noone will like you"" and this is toxic but unlearning is easier said than done.

2,"You can build your self esteem. I like the book the six pillars of self esteem. It explains a lot, and outlines some good ideas for developing self esteem. A couple quick things are to make small promises to yourself and keep them, treat yourself with intention as if you're your best friend (meaning when you make a plan with yourself, don't overwrite it for plans with others; get yourself things because they're nice not because you ""earned"" them), act in accordance with your values not the expectations of others.


Figure out what some of your weaknesses are as a result of the corrupted relationships of your childhood. Practice engaging in problem areas with healthy, stable relationships in your present life. If you have a friend who is very reasonable, that's who you can practice disagreements with for example - they'll show you through their engagement with you that it's not unsafe. Our brains are trained by our experiences, and we need to dismantle the defense mechanisms we developed as kids to be able to function as adults, these defense mechanisms are not us being broken, they were the right tools for the job yesterday, but today we need new tools.


If part of it was about school performance, you can work on detaching self worth from achievement. I can't push you through the steps of realisation, but the truth is that worth is an inherent quality - you're good enough as is. Understand this rationally first, then as you progress through development you can direct yourself towards perspectives that reinforce this. Eventually you will finally ""get it"" just like how to all of us at one point even basic maths and literacy was nonsense.

2,"Agree with the other comment that a familiar experience can become a comfortable one. There's a book called the body keeps the score that dives into trauma and talks about experiences such as this. Activities that cause fear or pain in the past can later become thrilling experiences. Excluding drugs, if you think of parachute jumping or marathons, what's uncomfortable at first becomes enjoyable. The strong emotions overpower the pain. But the new enjoyability, now like a drug, becomes harder to withdraw from; it's fear of withdrawal of the activity rather than enjoyment of the activity. I would highly recommend therapy to have someone help process the experiences you've mentioned and understand them better.",HotAndSpricey,19ckfqx

Since I don't know details, simply feeling off is a good enough reason to see a therapist. The point of therapy even in the case of trauma is not ""unleash bad memories"", it's to confront it and understand it. To find the truth in it. This means talking, and yes venting is a form of articulating your feelings so it kinda works. 

Therapists have loads of science that you can't even begin to imagine that help this process. They know where to look, what to ask, they nudge you in the right direction masterfully (given that their good at it).

1,"With you mentioning the flashbacks, I’m assuming you’re confusing “trauma” with PTSD. Trauma, at its most basic definition, is a disturbing experience. If it affected you emotionally to the point where you still think about it years later, that was trauma. And it isn’t the same for everyone. For someone else that might’ve not been traumatic at all, but seeing as you’re even asking about it, it clearly was for you. 

If you’re really concerned about how it might be affecting you in the long term, I’d recommend seeking out professional help. I also know that behavior like what your brother did is very rarely (if ever) completely random and is usually part of a pattern of behavior, so I genuinely hope he’s getting/he got the help he needs as well.",eowynsamwise,15qhaa2

3,"No, it is not a stupid question at all. Trauma is a complex experience, and it can manifest in different ways for different people. There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of whether or not an event counts as trauma.  
  
In your case, you experienced a very frightening and potentially life-threatening event. Your brother tried to stab you with a knife saw, and you were only able to escape because your mother intervened. This is a very traumatic event for anyone, regardless of age.  
  
The fact that you don't have ""crazy flashbacks"" doesn't mean that you weren't traumatized. Trauma can manifest in many different ways, including:

* Reliving the event in your thoughts or dreams
* Having strong emotional reactions to reminders of the event
* Avoiding situations that remind you of the event
* Feeling numb or detached from your emotions
* Having trouble sleeping or concentrating
* Difficulty trusting others
* Changes in mood or behavior

0,"Trauma is hard because as much as we want to forget about the past, they are scars on our memory that we keep forever. For me personally, I've gone to therapy since I was 8 for my trauma, and talking to someone always helps, but they have to be empathetic and understand the situation. 

Finding my spouse was a big help bringing me back to my original self because she simply believes in me, which gives me someone to fight for. During stressful periods, I always get reminded of how things were, but then I remember that was then, this is now, and every situation is different. 

As children, we kind of have no choice but to play the hands we're dealt and copw with the loss. However, as adults, we learn to control our situations and better our outcomes. We can't change the past, but we can control the present. 

Our situations may be different, but some things that help me during rough times are:

- Having a close relationship with a few people who I trust that have never let me down.

- Finding a reason to fight when I don't want to. Whether it's having kids, pets, or something else, knowing that someone or something depends on you really motivates me because I remember how helpless I was as a child. Now that's different. Now, I can take charge by learning from the past to try and create a better future.

- Having lots of hobbies and interests. I try learning as much as possible. Everything from car repair to playing piano. They are genuine things that I love doing, and it brings me peace of mind. Very cathartic.

- Having a good therapist. There's nothing wrong with going to therapy for your entire life. I've gone for 25 years and counting, and it's nice having an hour a month to have someone listen who is dedicated to helping you find solutions to deal with your day to day life. Although it's incredibly important to find one that you can bond with.

Those are a few things that have helped me, and although our situations are different, I've suffered from constant abuse, unexpected deaths, and being outcasted my entire childhood. It definitely sucks, but we can get through it because, deep down, our core personality is strong, courageous, and adventurous. Nothing can change that.

It may be that you will have a better chance of success if you learn a little bit of the new country's language.  
  
I can tell you this from personal experience. Immigrants don't have to know very much of the new country's language. A language has a ""pyramid"" of words. At the top of the pyramid is a very small number of words that people use all the time. If you only know the 50 or 100 words that people use most often, you can do a lot of communication.  
  
You also want to know ""survival"" words - words for buying food, getting medical help, things like that.

3,"Hello. I have dealt with similar struggles since my “spiritual awakening”. That was basically the sum of several large events (including a divorce whilst having three children) that shook me to my core, shattered my reality, and gave me an entirely new perspective on life. 

I am a totally different person and I’m trying to stop comparing myself to the person I was before. The person I was before was always social and outgoing but I *never* paid any attention to myself or how or what I was feeling before. I was fully operating from fight or flight and was not moving consciously through life. 

I’ve found everything even down to my hobbies have changed and since coming out of fight or flight for the first time in my life, I’ve realized I am very gifted in connecting with people and reading them and assisting them with working through their own traumas, if they’re ready. This is an amazing gift that I’m so thankful for and I know all of my “negative” life experiences gave me this gift but now that I’m conscious of others’ energy and my own, it has certainly made connecting on a basic, surface level friendly conversation really challenging.

All of that is to say, I think struggling to rebuild a little after going through some intense heavy life events, such as a divorce, especially with children, is just another part of the healing process but you cannot use the same approach, tactics, or even the same type of people to connect with as you did before. You’ll want to connect deeply to feel understood, rightfully so, because carrying that hurt and trauma around gets heavy without a supportive friend or partner. 

I think you need to do some work on your confidence and understanding what you bring to the table also. Those confidence issues will lead to anxious energy or a need for constant reassurance which is quite literally an energetic push away for most (healthy) people, which is why it may seem you attract only people with issues too. Plus, who would want to be friends with someone who *wouldnt* be friends with someone because of their looks/appearance? Doesn’t sound like the kind of judgy person I’d want to be around anyways. 🙂 The right friends will enjoy you and love you for your energy and your personality, not your appearance….so try to focus on that. (That’s what I’ve done and it’s helped immensely with taking my focus off of the insecurity) telling myself I’m pretty doesn’t work, but reminding myself I wouldn’t want to be friends with the kind of person who wouldn’t see me for more than that anyways helps me reframe it to “their loss, not mine”

As others have suggested, try some new hobbies that will get you out of your comfort zone in a healthy way. In my field of work, we encourage “healthy risk taking”…go try something new! Approach someone you’d never approach and start a conversation, go to a gym class and feel awkward but laugh the entire time (me lol), or just simply reflect on what kind of friend/partner you want in your life and go BE that person for others. 

Your community/people will show up. ❤️",,15vxdk4

7,New day new you. You need to look and see what is the lesson in why your relationship failed. Was it communication or did you failed to give attention ? What could you do better?Sometimes it takes two to tango or just learn what cause that relationship to fail and know what not to do for the next girl and make peace with it.Then thinking you are failure or it's because of your looks.  It's about finding you again. And these experiences don't define you they just make you better with time.  You are worth someone's time. What would like to teach your kids when it comes to dating or self worth.  Try a new experience to open your horizons to more possibilities rather than  focus any faults you may have. All humans have faults. You got burnt don't be scared to try again. Go for therapy as well it will help you focus on the areas you need work on. And good luck to you. Everyone deserves to be loved.

9,"She didn't grow bored. She was trying to find her ways.. Since you were BOTH looking for happiness outside yourselves.  It never works. as long as you are looking for happiness on the outside, you won't find it.

What you are feeling now, you have been suppressing for a long time. The ending of the marriage only forced you to look into it. But you seem to be afraid to look into it.
There are things you need to see and questions you need to ask. so you can learn what your life is trying to teach you at the moment.  The cicle will repeat itself when we dont learn.. 
You have probably been doing most of your life what other people thought it was right for you to do. Not what  you thought it would truly make you happy. That's why you found in the church girl some scape while you were married.  

The girl from church was not paying "" too much"" attention to you. You were open to the attention before it was given to you.  She was just reflecting back to you, what you were sending out 
Unfortunately, you have learned through others not to love and validate yourself.  You were looking  for validation outside of you. 
No matter how much you do to change your looks or how much money you make, as long as you keep looking for validation outside yourself, you will always end up hurt or hurting someone. 
That need will never be satisfied from outside.  you deserve love..but from yourself first. You deserve validation but from yourself first..  can you love and validate yourself?

You had 5 relationships in 4 years. What were they trying to show you? There is a lesson here to be learned.  
You are not a bad person. You are learning about yourself.  Dont be afraid to ask yourself your own questions. you will be guided from within. 

Meds will only numb you. They will not help you make questions. They will not cure. Your problems will always remain there unless, of course, you commit to a lifelong need of meds and of others to help you. They will not help you evolve. They will keep you where you are. 

You have already used meds. They didn't work. Your marriage was a ""med"", your kids were ""meds"", your church was a ""med"". church girl was a ""med"". The lies to your wife were a ""med"".  
They were just temporary band-aid for your wounds. Whatever was it that took your confidence away, took it from you a long time before your wife. 
When you were a kid. 
Someone made you believe you are not worthy or good enough. 
That's not true. And it will never be true. You are worthy, and you are good, and more than  enough.   

About your looks, it can be improved.  First, with your own acceptance. Change can happen when we first accept ourselves as we are. That's the first step to long-lasting change. 
You have hated yourself and shamed yourself for your looks long enough . It didn't work. It is time that you learn to give yourself the love you are looking for.

 People were nice to you because you were a pastor. and that was your identity.  
Now that you are not that anymore, you lost your only sense of self, so you are anxious and feel awkward around people.. there is no one feeding your ego .. 

Your old identity kept you safe. The little thing that gave you some level of confidence is not there. Your marriage that kept you comfortable is not there anymore.  n
Now you kind of have to face yourself raw.. and that's scary. it is very understandable, most of us who sewrch for the truth will go through this....
It is scary, but it is far worse to not face yourself,  question yourself,  your truths, and be on in a prison in the safety of comfort for the rest of your life. Lying to yourself.  Never becoming the man you are here to be, full-fledged expression of your trueself.  There is nothing more depressing and enpty in life than holding yourself back, with negative beliefs and limitations,  just because you can't face the unknown.  

Your trueself is unknown to you. And that's the true depression. You are not being completely honest with yourself.  
Depression is Compression.
It is when you have been looking for answers everywhere else, outside yourself ,but you couldn't find it.  So we compress.  
The answer is within. The kingdom of God is within. Not in the church.  
Ask yourself: What is it about myself that I need to learn to unconditionally love? 
Research out of your comfort zone. Dont stop looking for the truth.  If you are unhappy, you haven't found it yet.. God is not condemning you. You are. 
Go within.  meditate. Ask yourself questions. Listen for the answers. 
Do some serious self-development research. Study it. Improve yourself and your health. Take responsibility for your actions. Take time for yourself.  Going into another relationship at this moment will give you the exact same thing the others gave you. 

Be honest . ask yourself questions.  Question your own bullshit. 
Go to therapy, yes. it might open some doors for you.  It might give you extra guidance . Ultimately, only you can take yourself out of the hole. 🕳 
Dont stop searching for the truth that will set you free.",chauane,15vxdk4

23,"I suggest searching for a “patient advocate”. My 12 yr old daughter attempted suicide last November & spent 10 days in a psych ward. I went on Family Medical Leave from the good paying job I had been at for 7yrs. When i went back to work, on my 1st day they told me my schedule had changed (I had been hybrid 9-1 in office, 3-6 at home), & so had my job duties. I was no longer allowed to work from home AT ALL, & had to be in the office 9-5 & if I was late or had to leave early ONCE, I would be let go for “job abandonment”. Since I wasn’t aware of this change, I had not made arrangements for my daughter getting picked up from school that day. I told them. They said no, so I left anyway. That night I texted my supervisor & friend (left laptop at work, so no email) giving her the heads up I would not be coming in in the morning. Because of that apparently I quit & wasn’t fired, and I lost health insurance & unemployment abilities. I lost everything.

I called my daughter’s social worker from her hospital & asked (pleaded) for help because i was having a breakdown. He gave me some referrals & suggestions, & I placed a call. When I told them I had no income & no insurance, they gave me the number to a community health clinic & said to set up an appointment w a “financial navigator”. I did. She set me up w MassHealth. Then I called the Mental Health place back, got an appointment, & a week later went in for an hour appointment with a “patient advocate”, and an hour with a “mental health specialist”. I was completely blown away and never knew these services were available or even existed. Tomorrow is my 1st appointment w a therapist & I am beyond excited for my future!

TL/DR: it’s not that you aren’t trying hard enough, it’s that it is too hard to do it without help. Look for “financial navigators” & “patient advocates”. They are literally there to help you get help.",Jezebels_lipstick,15vxdk4

26,"Yep all great advice is these last comments, just do them. Get therapy and medication ASAP, a psychiatrist and a therapist. You sound very similar to me, while I’m younger and have less life experience overall i have figured out slowly how to get it more together and keep it together and I have been struggling for a bit longer than you so have some insight in this front. Thank god I’m living with parents otherwise I would have been screwed. 

You definitely have depression and anxiety which is causing many of your deepest insecurities and fears to plague you. Meds and therapy will help stabilize your thoughts and emotions. You sound overall highly mature, self-disciplined to be managing to still show up every day for yourself and your kids despite all this. That is great because it sounds like you have caught onto this early, even if doesn’t seem like it you have caught onto it early enough where you can easily bounce back because you don’t seem to have really held yourself back further than you had been pushed down by life. Many of us caught onto these things way too late, and now we have to deal with it chronically unless they come up with a scientific miracle soon. In your case it sounds like a situational case but it’s possible you have bad genetics and are unlucky like many of us. Even that’s not the end of the world as as soon as you get treated you are able to start getting back to life. 

Best of luck. I’m sorry your wife put you through this. Divorce is never good, but separating when having 3 kids is something that needs to be seriously discussed. And if someone is being unfaithful and decides to continue doing so, they should immediately have a big sit down convo especially in a marriage with kids instead of sneaking around that long. That just sounds awful in so many ways. It sounds like your left holding the bag, scratching your head wondering what happened with her, what do you tell the kids, how will custody work, divorce filings, lawyer bs, not to mention dealing with this family and legal drama on top of the mental health crisis it causes. 

Please reach out to a therapist ASAP and your parents first. Then when you start getting this off your chest more, and stabilizing with the meds, start doing the meetups and finding some sort of community-based activity that you like, maybe having a workout routine also. Don’t be in a rush to find any community or group of friends or girlfriend either. Really find what clicks before locking it in be it a friendship or a relationship. Don’t worry about replacing your wife and mother to your sons asap. Instead find a woman whom you really have a good time with, whom you deeply trust also, and whom your kids like as well. Same goes for friends and focus on quality and not quantity. It’s better to have 2 or 3 friends you could call your family instead of 15 fake friends or shallow relationships.

0,"Hey, I’m sorry you’re going through this and am glad to hear you’re working with a mental health professional. If your daughter isn’t working with someone, that may help her as well. Lots of psychiatrists and psychologists utilize telehealth visits too which could be helpful while you’re in the hospital. 

Medication is obviously a case by case conversation - everyone is different. Since it sounds like you’re already considering it and wondering if it could be a good option, I’d absolutely bring it up and see what they say. There’s no harm in asking and evaluating your options. It also helps the, understand where you’re at and what you need to focus on together. In terms of being “healed”, there is always going to be trauma and that’s okay. There will be ebbs and flows, good days and bad but the important thing is how you choose to show up for yourself. While trauma never really goes away, it can be something that lies in a distant background instead of front and center. Show yourself grace during this process 🤍

Only share if you want, but are there particular things about the hospital stay that are triggering? Certain moments where you notice you feel triggered or out of control? 

I ask because I have a situation with a loved one that brings up similar feelings. She’s bipolar and schizophrenic and has substance abuse issues so I’ve dealt with some really traumatic hospitalizations with her. My grandfather was also in ICU for a month and a half before passing away recently. I spent that time with him in the hospital and was there when he passed…. For me, I have a system for myself to keep my stress in check as much as possible. I have a certain playlist I listen to when I drive there. I have my routine and bag dialed in for the hospital, I usually bring my iPad so I can draw and use art to decompress. After, I have my “wind down” routine. I keep it structured so I feel in control when everything else feels like it’s spiraling. Something like this might be helpful.

I see there are no general threads, so I will ask my question here, because you seem to be a cool lad and since you're not exposing your own issues, I don't feel like I am ""stealing"" your space.  
  
Is it possible to find some guidance/emotional support on this sub, other than quick/technical answers that may be useful for some but rarely are for someone who is highly involved in overthinking and already talked things out with the few relatives/friends he has/had.  
  
I am in the process of being helped by a psychiatrist (it takes a lot of time to get to the first meeting because it is a socialized program, and I don't know how much they will actually care about me and try to help me).  
  
Do you know also know other subreddits (or anything, actually) where I could find some kind of support ?  
I think that my main issues (at least on the surface, maybe when I dig deeper I'll find something else) are dramatic sociability, self-confidence issues and a total lack of drive (which used to result in a lot of procrastination, but now I don't really procrastinate because I simply have nothing to do) : to the point that just seeking for help took me months. And I fear that if my first encounter with the psychiatrist doesn't go well (which happened a few months ago when I used to see one, in the private sector), I might lose many more months because I won't have the drive to keep looking for proper help.",TheInventionOfSelf,nara2h

I'm concerned about a couple of other aspects, too.
You said that you'd normally be on your own, caring for this child and one other? 

1. This child needs more than one carer in charge. Imagine if your shadower hadn't been there and this behaviour in the car occurred. No one to restrain the child and a severely distracted driver = serious accident. 

2. How does this child's behaviour affect your other charge, aside from the safety factor? Is the other child having nightmares or feeling traumatised by this child? Are their parents aware of the events in the car? They should be.

3. I'm also worried that you or your employer could be sued for something like this

To prevent it from _becoming_ PTSD, you need to figure out a way to ""complete the stress cycle.""

PTSD happens when your body gets ""stuck"" in fight/flight/freeze and continues to be ""stuck"" or is easily ""sent back"" to your trauma for long after the initial experience.

Here are some suggestions from a series that Emily Nagoski did recently about ""completing the stress cycle"":

Talk to someone you love, that loves you, about what happened. The idea is to make that connection and feel heard and supported.

Have a 20 second hug.

Get your body moving. Dance, run, do yoga, push your body to its physical limits.

I've had experiences with people who were psychotic and violent, and it is my sense that it dangerous for both you as well as her to continue your working relationship. I personally am not equipped to respond to this, very few are, and your input that this child needs more and your advocacy for her to receive it is the best thing you could do in this situation. 

The tools we are taught are force and domination, and those behaviors are very hard to remove ourselves from. I know in moments of high stress and fear, I cannot maintain the calm composure that positive reinforcement requires. Please don't take my words as judgement. I would not have acted any differently in your situation. But this child needs very careful handling. They are incredibly fragile, and as you know, have the potential to cause serious harm. They also have the potential to heal, they are so young. It is going to take a huge community to help her through that, and people who have the training and experience to navigate it.

I strongly recommend speaking to a trained psychologist to prevent the forming of PTSD. If that isnt possible, please talk to friends, family or someone you feel comfortable telling this story to. As often as is necessary for you to feel kinda safe again. It'll take some time to get over this.
The important thing is to get if off your chest, and get the fear-feelings out of the memory. You could try EMDR therapy, this will get the emotion out of the memory and allows you to look back on it without the nervousness and other emotional/bodily reactions.

22,"I ran this by my wife who works in foster care and has seen similar situations during her career. First of all, I just want to say thank you for doing the job you do. Society's mental health needs are so under addressed it's absurd, and your job is both a noble and extremely difficult one. So first and foremost I want to say your self care is important too and keep that in the foreground of this response. Also, I make some assumptions in my reply as I'm drawing directly from her work in foster care and I realize your agency likely works differently but I have no visibility into how, so this is just a ""what she would recommend"" response.

With that in mind, there may be options for this child in the future. I don't know what your agency's policies are but at my wife's, since the child made a homicidal statement then the incident would have to be reported and the child put on a mandatory in-patient mental health hold for 72hrs at a hospital. Additionally, if the caretaker (you) in the incident will still work with the girl going forward you would be provided a multi-point lockable harness for driving that prevents that kind of movement for the child altogether. Remember, the child not only endangered herself, you and your colleague but also anyone else who passed or was near you on the road that day.

I said ""if the caretaker..."" above because that's a big if. My wife also said it's common for children who exhibit that behavior to get reassigned to caretakers who have decades of experience, and maybe only focus on 1 or 2 children at a time. So I'll reiterate here that your self care is CRITICAL and it would be completely normal for anyone to be traumatized by this experience. It would also be normal to request the child is moved to a more experienced caretaker and for total clarity, that's not a knock on you at all. You're only 22 (color me jealous btw) and I am just assuming there may be older and more experienced colleagues in your agency.

In a nutshell: what you do is hard, so don't downplay the trauma. Talk to your agency about the risks, homicidal statement, and precautions (i.e. lockable harness) that can be taken in the future. If the child is too dangerous, ask about transferring them to a more experienced caretaker. And above all - take care of yourself, because the mental health world needs you and you will be most effective at what you do when you are healthy.

Reading between the lines, this girl was trying to gain control. Is there an imbalance of control in her life? 

I find when people have too much control in one area, they have a difficult time making a choice. If someone or something is taking too much control from them they try to overcompensate and gain it elsewhere. 

Perhaps if you are ever in a similar situation give them options. More than two but not too many. That way you give them some control. However, only give them choices you are comfortable following through with. And as someone else mentioned in the thread. Safety. Do not forget about your own or their safety.

Good luck to you. And don’t forget to forgive yourself for your own mistakes. It’s all part of learning. You did a good job handling such a situation with the tools you had at hand. I’d be proud of you. You’ve done well.

As for the killing part. If she’s stuck in a duality choice loop, perhaps she feels thats what you or other people want to do to her, kill her that is. Thus she threatened to do it back.

If that means they aren't allowed to go on field trips anymore, well, it's for everyone's safety. I think we can both agree that jobs like ours are never *really* safe, because random things can happen just out of nowhere. This doesn't mean that we have to put ourselves in situations we *know* are going to potentially harm/kill someone. I'm really sorry you had to go through that.

I can't remember the usernames on here (I'm responding on my mobile) but a lot of them mentioned completing the stress cycle. I'm 100% agreed on that.

I have a somewhat related question for you. Do you have shift change and/or debriefing after incidents at your job? I find speaking with my coworker about what had happened (usually while writing the report) really helps me. We're all college educated and have at least a diploma in Child & Youth Counseling.

0,"I'd strongly advise against this. Don't work from the memory to the present, work from the present to the limitation, regardless on what form it takes. Be it a negative memory, traumatic event, or a belief that you've formulated over the years yourself.  


Learning to categorize your memories as 'traumatic' based on technical satisfactions really potentiates a lot of unnecessary self victimization. If you can identify a thought or emotion that causes harm in your life, you have plenty of  incentivize to trace it back to the memory which informs that limitation regardless of which it was.  


If a memory is 'traumatic' but has no impact on your present wellness, it is less important to reflect on than a memory that is simply 'negative' but which influences a lot of harmful behavior.   


This isn't to say that trauma isn't a real concept and isn't important to identity and confront, it's to say that you should not operate with a bias that seeks to confirm trauma and assign it importance without a functional reason to do so.",KoachMonkey,1bot8l2

You don't have to force yourself to feel one way or another about it, but what he did was abuse and wrong, and you're allowed to be hurt by it.

What he did counts as both child sexual abuse/grooming, as well as incest.

The first thing I realized is that I have pretty bad trust issues. 

I also get super anxious and uncomfortable around men, specially when there's no one else around. 
I don't even like thinking about it/acknowledging it, but sometimes I feel uneasy around my dad, who's never done anything of that nature, and knows what happened. 

I feel like it messed up the line that separates family and sexual stuff, ik? 
It's embarrassing to admit, but for some time in middle school I thought these inappropriate relationships were normal :/

To this day, I don't like interacting with/greeting uncles or male cousins. I keep reading between the lines, and overthinking every interaction, to then come to the ""conclusion"" that they are hitting on me.

Also definitely don’t feel guilty for not understanding that what he was doing was wrong at the time or during school. Like you said, you were a small child that was very easily molded. Children naturally trust adults. That’s evolutionarily how humans are.

From what you’ve written about having these feelings since you were a child you could have (I’m not a doctor) complex PTSD (CPTSD) from physical or emotional neglect or abuse during your childhood.

You can find a lot of helpful advice on these subreddits: r/CPTSD, r/EMDR, r/dbtselfhelp, and r/socialskills.

I have found reading posts on these subs to be very helpful in making me feel less alone and giving me a lot of good advice about how to get better. It’s kind of like being in a big online therapy group. 

A trauma informed therapist could also help you.

Good luck! Keep us posted! You deserve to be happy! ❤️",SaucyAndSweet333,17gqeqr
3,"I believe you can heal. Even by yourself.  If you really want to. You have to really want.. 

I know how it feels to feel so powerless, to feel like you can't control your emotions.  You feel like you are your own prisoner. No matter how much you would want to be stronger or better, it feels like you will never make it. I know how it feels.

But I know you can, and you will. You have to genuinely be tired of being where you are.

As long as you aren't tired enough of repeating the same patterns and having the same kind of cycles and relationships, you will always fall victim to what happened to you. You really need to have had enough.

You want to feel loved. You want to be cared for. You want to feel comfortable and safe with someone.  You want to feel like you belong and are important.
You need to give these things to yourself.  As long as you don't give it to yourself,  you will crave from another, and it will show. It will repel people , unless they are in the same boat as you. In that case you will be attracted to each other very strongly. 

Yes, I understand you felt alone, probably abandonment.     You can use this to be a weight on you and on other people's shoulders, or you can use it to learn more about life, about yourself, and to actually learn to unconditionally love yourself, and in this way become a example of love to others.  
You have to know that you deserve to be loved. Because I know deep down you don't believe you do deserve. 
You do deserve the most kind and loving love. Long lasting love. 

You said you are literally your favorite person, but you hate being by yourself.  That's so contradicting . 

You conditionally ""love"" yourself.  You don't love yourself when you are by yourself.  
Would you love yourself if you didn't have anything else, no social opportunities , or not a great life? Would you love yourself if no one else would want to have a relationship with you? 

Understand? Because that's the love you need to develop,  it is unconditional love. Not "" I love myself because I have a great life or great opportunities or because i am with someone. ""

Can you learn to face the feelings you are running away from?  Can you face th3 things you are scared to face? 
Whatever anyone has made you feel when you were a toddler had nothing to do with you. Nothing. They were wrong, and they didn't know better.  I am very sorry for whatever you had to go through as a toddler. That's so not fair. 

Although it may feel hard, deep healing requires making peace with your past. Can you forgive them, maybe someday? Can you let go? Can you accept what happened? Can you become the best version of yourself because of what happened to you? Can you be with yourself so you can understand what are the negative beliefs you have that are not serving you anymore? 
These are the things you need to face so you can build new beliefs for yourself and be strong within yourself. To heal your wounds, become th3 best version of yourself, and become a great independent partner to someone.  
Become someone who truly unconditionally loves himself even if you would be alone. 

True love doesn't come from ulterior motives. It comes from within.  If you truly unconditionally loved yourself,  you would want to take some time for yourself.  Not right away searching for someone. You are searching for something to fill in some void. And if you trace it all back, it will come down to unconditionally self-love. Even if it is not your fault . Even if it was because of your caregivers that you didn't learn to unconditionally love yourself. You self-abandon yourself because someone else emotionally or physically abandoned you.

Anyways, I know, and I truly believe you can heal by yourself. 
• You can go to some   EMDR or some other kind of psychotherapy or therapy if you can afford it.
If not, you can still heal by yourself, you will have to research and learn. 
•It is important to practice belly breathing, deep breathing ,mindfulness, and meditation for  self-regulation. 
•You can learn and understand some form of spirituality, you can read about healthy relationships, and you can research about true unconditional self-love  and self-worth. ( Maybe then you can understand why people tell you why you need to learn to love yourself.  This was not taught to you when you were a child, so you have really not truly learned to love yourself. )

• watch Joe Dispenza talks about breaking the habit of being yourself, becoming a new version of yourself etc.
• Watch Neville Goddard on youtube, so you can remember how our inner world affects our outer world.

I don't want a friend using me as a free therapist, but I have no problem with a stranger just messaging me or coming up to me and asking to vent about a few things they're going through.

Some people go through things commonly described as ""traumatic"" events, and while it might impact them greatly, it doesn't always mean they're left traumatised.

0,"So firstly, Bipolar isn't an issue only related to traumatic upbringings. It can be caused by things such as persistent drug snd alcohol use, genetics, and family history of it. It's likely you developed it simply because of your genetics. It could be likely too, that the family members who were struggling with addiction issues, also exhibited signs of Bipolar. I'm also someone who has a mental health issue that none if my family members have, so I can understand how it would be frustrating and confusing. 

Secondly, EDs can develop from any causes, not necessarily through traumatic upbringings or bullying. I developed my ED because of a psychotic episode that led to me naturally restricting my food, and then later becoming addicted to restriction. It never began through bullying, or self hate, or because of my traumatic childhood. It was simply a side effect of a longer existing mental illness. Getting some therapy for your ED can help you learn what the root cause of it could be. It's even possible that the Bipolar is affecting your ED, increasing the likelihood of being addicted to either restriction, or consumption.",Fancypotato1995,1bugbd7

3,"Honestly, same. However, it turns out I had a pretty messed up life and I just thought it was normal. I don't know your entire situation, but maybe that's the case too. I definitely think genetics play a part, but I don't know enough about that to really tell you anything more. Except that privileged children can have trauma too. I didn't think I was ""allowed"" to, since my parents loved me, but that is just plain wrong!",Relative-Count3459,1bugbd7

6,"This definitely sounds like something that is beyond the scope of a reddit thread. Almost nobody on this thread has the authority to diagnose you, and the ones who do have that authority would not because they know nothing about you. 

This sounds like a deeprooted and unique scenario that should definitely be left to a professional to unearth. 

To put it simply, this sounds complicated and anyone who has the arrogance to come up with an explanation based off this thread should not be taken seriously",Jazzlike_Ad_8236,1bugbd7
7,"Bipolar girl here. You do not have to have trauma to be bipolar. As other have said it's a chemical imbalance. I'm sorry you're going through this, it's a really tough disorder to have and I hope the best for you.",harold_the_cat,1bugbd7

0,"The first and biggest point is therapy. She’s got trauma deep-rooted enough to choke a sequoia. This isn’t something you can sort out with good intentions and love alone. It’s great she’s seen a therapist, but it sounds like she’s dodging the real issues. She needs someone specialized in sexual trauma. As for her fear of her parents finding out, this is her health and her future we're talking about. It’s about finding a way, whether it’s a therapist who can work under the radar or online counseling that doesn’t leave a paper trail.

You guys need to crank the communication up to eleven. Not just talking, but communicating with the intent to truly understand each other’s feelings and boundaries. This isn’t just about you needing sex or her needing space, it’s about understanding each other's emotional and physical needs and how you can meet halfway, if possible.

If she’s up for it, explore other forms of physical intimacy that might not trigger her. This might need guidance from a sex therapist, but things like non-penetrative acts, or simply exploring sensual but non-sexual physical closeness could help. It's about baby steps and comfort zones.

 You can't fix her. You can support her, encourage her, but at the end of the day, she has to walk her path to recovery herself. If she’s totally resistant to therapy despite its necessity, you need to decide how long you can live in this status quo.

This shit isn’t easy on you either. Consider seeing a therapist on your own. You need a space to vent and learn how to cope with your own feelings in this.

Define what you both need from this relationship clearly. Set boundaries that protect both your emotional well-being. If things aren’t changing, what’s your plan? You can’t drown with her.

This isn’t just about getting through another day, it's about figuring out if you can build a future together that isn't haunted by the ghosts of her past. That’s the hard truth, and only you two can decide if you’re up for that climb.

0,"Taking in the full event and how it affects the totality of you. 

Many people default to dealing with trauma by blocking it, and you can get pretty far in life with that being an effective method. That means actively not thinking about it, and stopping yourself every time you do.",alsoilikebeer,17ifemr
1,By reliving it. The longer we avoid it the worst it gets. We have to face the traumas first before we can let go. Most people avoid the deep seeded side that makes us vulnerable and we will only touch the surface. Kind of like feeling better after a cry. You eyes will be more open to how it affected you in the deepest parts of your soul. When you open that box it's going to hurt bad but you will get better.,,17ifemr
