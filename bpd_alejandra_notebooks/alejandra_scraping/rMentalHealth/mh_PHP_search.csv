1,RTC and PHP,My 14 year old daughter is currently at an inpatient mental health hospital.

5,starting PHP (partial hospitalization program) tomorrow and am so anxious,"I think what I’m looking for is reassurance that the apprehension and anxiety I am feeling about starting this program tomorrow is normal. I am going to a php program that was the only option in my area covered by my insurance so it’s this or nothing. 

I’m a 22 y/o student who had to put their life on hold as I had a complete mental breakdown over the holidays where I also broke my sobriety. I dropped out of college, quit my job, forfeited opportunities for internships to pursue mental wellness for myself and I’m starting to question whether I’m actually ready for help. Granted, I don’t have much going for me or anything to lose for that matter bc my will to live has been in the gutter.

However, I do need the help and was admitted to the program for good reason. It’s daunting because many patients in the program; on average, “graduate” within 6 months time. It’s a huge commitment. I feel like I’m not worth the investment of my own time and energy. Additionally I feel like my perception of “progress” could be VERY different from how the staff views my progress in the program… that freaks me out. Honestly the goal is to get through the program asap so I can continue working. I don’t have the funds to just not be working. I am torn though because the way I feel currently and the way I have been living is unsustainable.",1707291943.0,False,2,2,Cold_Pay1189,None,1akxqlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1akxqlp/starting_php_partial_hospitalization_program/
6,Php annoyances,"Does anyone that's currently or even experienced php program get annoyed how some long term patients (not the ones just there off from work on medical leave) like the ones in and out of psych hospitals,rehab or live in managed living/have conservators etc *not judging just explaining the difference in patient demographic in these programs* they will just dominate the group therapy sessions,interrupt the group leader(therapist),other patients with advice and opinions and or anything popping into their mind at the moment,no matter how random/not appropriate . I get if its a new patient but some are longterm in and out of the program so know the rules. At least know basic etiquette just to function daily. Idk what is worse the group leader not shutting it down when it gets to be taking up too much group time or the individual some of which have been in and out if the program for years which I get as many are on permanent disability or to the point they don't get or care what they're doing.  Some of us just feel while these programs offer alot in the way of techniques to process trauma and stress,anger,wanting to isolate yourself etc it's just frustrating when they let these long term clients act however (not all therapists do this btw some are good with shutting it down) in group. I mean is the insurance $ that good they're getting from each patient that they're reluctant to say anything? Some have behavioral issues that others have complained on them and they talk to them i suppose but inevitably start acting up again. They'll say oh we talked to him about that or whatever but the person still does doesn't gaf. I told the psychiatrist during my appt and he has that face like he totally gets what I'm talking about .

Other than that if I manage to zone those annoyances out,the program has helped me in many ways.",1682036946.0,False,1,0,crazeeeee81,None,12tkijc,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/12tkijc/php_annoyances/
7,Fellow PHP patient blamed another patient. (Self-harm trigger warning),"I just gotta vent, and I know my desire to vent is hypocritical given the situation but here we go.

I'm currently in a PHP program, and everyone there is of course struggling with something. There are two patients relevant here, one who I will call Celery (I tend to use food as names so there's no risk of someone being like ""Oh, that's a similar name to X"") and the other I will call Pasta. 

Celery has struggled with self-harm, as have I. I will admit it's not pleasant and can be triggering to hear it discussed. But Celery honestly kinda buried the lead when discussing the fact that he relapsed. I can imagine it was uncomfortable to talk about, but as a whole the group was very supportive. I'm glad he spoke about it because he has had a very difficult time opening up to everyone, and it helps me feel less alone. Celery has come a lot way and I really look up to him, and he has a strength you don't see every day. My point here being Celery did not go into any detail about self-harm, merely mentioning the fact that he had coped poorly and self-harmed the night before. Most of what he said was about the thoughts that led him to make that choice.

Then Pasta started talking. Pasta jumped right out the gate with what could have been very triggering information, I don't think she triggered anyone but the point remains that if you're blaming your issues on someone talking about their issues, you probably shouldn't bring up drugs or suicide. Pasta said they were feeling pretty good when she came in today, but that Celery's mention of self-harm had doubled their depression symptoms because they had family who self-harmed. Now I don't have any issue with working through triggers, and I definitely appreciate the fact that this is an environment where it's easy to get triggered. But you just don't put that on another patient, it can send them backwards and is not going to un-trigger you. There are ways to say ""I'm having a hard time"" without blaming another patient. I got triggered by what Pasta said (because my brother's mental health issues are somewhat my fault) but I didn't say to her ""I'm triggered because you are talking about your  problems"" because that's counterproductive. The therapist didn't speak up, so I said nothing until after Pasta left, but it really upset me. My triggers are nobody else's problem, so I gotta deal with them. You don't get to blame this on other people who are there for the same reasons as you. When I was inpatient, there was another patient with fresh self-harm wounds. Did I walk up to him and demand he cover them up? No, I dealt with it and if I needed to , I left the room. Because he is going through his own shit and I don't need to make him feel guilty. Celery was already feeling pretty bad and he didn't that shit. I didn't say anything to the therapist, I just reassured Celery once Pasta left.

12,Tips for living at home w/ parents while in a trauma PHP (partial hospitalization program)?,"I am about to begin a trauma PHP tomorrow, and while I think this is the first time I am getting what I need mentally, I am very nervous about being at home through it.

I have loving parents, but they are not trauma informed people. So, I have such a fear that they are going to make this experience miserable for me. Some of the biggest fears that come to mind are having expectations about fast growth and antagonizing the inevitable emotional spirals that I will have as this continues (they tend to not see the PTSD behind my sadness and anger). I know the stereotype is that your wounds have to be activated before they can be healed, and if I have a period where I am angrier or worse during this, I fear I won’t have any space to express those emotions at home. I’ll either go emotionally mute or unintentionally start a fight when my mom doesn’t realize I’m just triggered… The PHP is only until 3:00, so what if the rest of the day just undoes the progress I make?

14,Is it worth going across the country to seek out a Partial Hospitalization Program? (PHP),"Hi,  
  
I have been twiddling my thumbs more or less for 6 months. I know I need to get higher care but from what I've seen, my home state, and especially my county/city is absolutely awful for mental health care (Dallas TX) and so I was hoping this place in SFO would accept me and they did but I realized even they're not that good.  
  
I don't really know how to compare the quality of care of a Dallas PHP to one in better states. Reviewers of said places only know so much about what the standard for mental health care is and idek what that standard is myself but yeah that's my dilemma.

16,Nervous for php (second time),"I was previously admitted into a php program for 2 weeks, followed by ~5 months of iop. That was when I was 17, so I was in the adolescent program with other high schoolers.

I am now 20, and about to be admitted into php again, but for adults this time. I’m nervous. I think I start Tuesday. 

I was hospitalized twice in a week for self harm + got stitches. I am not currently suicidal, but I honestly do want to put myself in a coma and get close to death.. but survive..??? Idk it doesn’t make sense to me either

I have also struggled with various eating disorders for 6 years. Mostly anorexia, but I gained weight and currently don’t technically qualify because my BMI isn’t low enough anymore.

They wanted to admit me to an eating disorder program, but since I’m not actively restricting, they’re opting for a mental health php to deal with my self harm.

I’m kinda scared for the other people in it.  Adolescent php was fine cause everyone was the same age within a few years. Now I could be with like 50 year olds or something. That’s scary. Idk how I feel.

A friend recommended it to me since I'm having a really hard time coping. That's an understatement. I am utterly devastated.

I realize to some it might sound extreme to look at the IOP or PHP route, but this breakup has destroyed my mental health. Previous divorces and breakups haven't hit me anywhere this hard.

30,Do I really need to go to a partial hospitalization program?,"3 years ago I had a bad “trip” on weed and it triggered intense feelings of derealization for me. Since then, I’ve been having extremely short (literally like 2 seconds) but almost daily episodes of feeling that derealization feeling. Nowadays it’s worst when I’m trying to sleep - I’ll experience it really intensely and snap awake before trying to sleep again. The feeling that my surroundings, memories, or even myself aren’t real causes me to panic and I’m frequently tense worrying that it’ll happen again. I’ve been prescribed a ton of meds throughout the past 3 years, including Abilify for a few months and an entire year of taking Klonopin. Currently I’m just taking Buspar and Elavil. I’ve been to 3 different counselors since this all started. The Klonopin did help, but I don’t want to go back on it because of its dependency-causing nature. My current counselor suggested I get assessed by a nearby mental hospital to see what they think I should do moving forward. Earlier today I got assessed and they recommended a PHP. I was surprised because that seems even more intense than an IOP. Fortunately, the PHP is 100% covered by my insurance if I do decide to go.

46,We are failing our children,"The mental health system for children in America is fucked. My daughter (11) needs more than once a week therapy but isn’t suicidal or violent and there’s essentially zero immediate help for her despite her school and I both understanding she needs more immediate care. I live in one of the best cities for healthcare (Boston), have good insurance and still - we have called over 20 child therapists that aren’t accepting new patients and have had Boston Children’s Hospital recommend a partial hospitalization program and guess what? There’s only ONE lone PHP program within a 40 mile radius of where I live that offers a program for children under 13 and it’s overflowing with no availability. This has been the most excruciating experience and I can only imagine how hopeless people feel in less populated areas with less access to healthcare. Why is it that we have to wait until children are suicidal in order to get immediate care?

I’m floored and at a loss and so sad that it’s this hard for my kiddo to get what she needs.

Edit: I want to clarify that she’s struggling day in and day out with depression, ADHD and anxiety - so much so, it’s been worsening, disrupting the classroom and the school (she goes to a private Montessori school because public was brutal for my kid) has urged her to get into a program before returning to school.",1582075366.0,False,299,97,Katasia,None,f62q8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/f62q8p/we_are_failing_our_children/

Overall, I spent my whole freshman and sophomore year in treatment as well as part of my junior year. I’m a senior in high school now, and I’ve recovered a lot, and I’ll be graduating soon. I’m excited for the next phase of my life, however, I still grieve a lot for those years of my life I lost to shitty treatment programs that did nothing but traumatize me, and I’m still in therapy trying to process and move on from the experience. I find it hard to relate to other people my age because I feel like I’ve missed out on having a “normal high school experience”, and I don’t want to trauma dump on them. In the long run, I know high school doesn’t matter, but it’s still such an isolating and lonely feeling right now.

Three of my visits happened during my fall semester which is what led me to drop out of the semester. The most recent on led me to drop this spring semester. I’ve been in residential treatment two times, and in PHP twice, and, after four months, am finally in IOP. I still am struggling with thoughts of sh and si too. I manage it better and have come to terms that those thoughts will never really “disappear.”

But I also want to be a therapist one day too. I don’t know what to do.

53,Considering a Partial Hospitalization Program,"CW: suicide

I have been struggling with chronic/clinical depression for most of the last 10 years. Lately it has been a lot worse--like the second worst episode with the first being when I almost attempted in 2019--and feel like I need extra help if I'm going to make it to the end of the year. 

I don't have any plans, but have been having suicidal feelings for over 2 months, don't sleep well, and barely have been eating. My therapist, psychiatrist, and I all agree the causes are all likely psycho-social or hormonal (I'm on hormone replacement therapy) and we are considering a partial hospitalization program (PHP). Anyone have experiences with PHP? 

I'm worried if the PHP is remote (not in-person) that I'm only going to feel even more isolated and lonely. But in-patient/full hospitalization seems too overwhelming and scary, and although I know there will be no academic/work repercussions (I'm a graduate student and teaching assistant) I am still extremely deterred by the thought of being gone for 1-2 weeks and then having to come back to a giant mess. But I also don't know if I'm making a mistake by thinking I can still keep up with all I'm doing now AND commit to a PHP. I'm afraid I'm minimizing and hiding my pain even from myself, or that I've been in it so long I can't see how bad I really am. Any thoughts/help is appreciated. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and I'm going to discuss with him too. But also wanted to hear other experiences and thoughts.

I kept on searching on google to find out what it is. Unfortunately, I can't find a single one, so I lived with it for 3 years. my anxiety convinced me that I must be the only one who experienced it and nobody will understand me.

Backstory: I’m currently an 18 year old girl who just started college. I had battled social anxiety and depression since I was 13. (undiagnosed but I knew. Unclear how much my parents knew). Started seeing someone at 16. But things went downhill. Nov 2021 things got worse. I had suicidal ideation and refused to go to school. I spent five weeks at a PHP program. After that, I refused to return to my HS so my parents enrolled me in a small private school. I ended up graduating in December 2022 and doing a gap year program before starting college in August. 

I’m doing well now thankfully but I’m terrified that i’ll go back to that place I was two years ago. I don’t know. I needed to vent.",1694136713.0,False,0,0,OkEnthusiasm6011,None,16cwzoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/16cwzoz/going_back_mental_health_wise/

73,How do I know if I am just sad or have depression?,"I know this is a basic question, but how do you know? I am a student in my final year of high school, & I recently moved from the PHP to Prague. I first thought the reason for my sadness may be due to the move but, moving is one of the only permanent things in my life, I'm in grade 12 & I've been to 9 schools.



I do not know the language here very well & thus, have a hard time communicating with my classmates & making friends (they all speak czech in class even though it is an English-speaking school, I don't know why, teachers can't change do anything). This has led to me being very isolated & alone. This is most likely the reason for my sadness but, after some reflection, I realized I am now never truly happy. I realized this when my new little sister was born but, the event never made me feel happy or even anything.



So I want to know, is this just sadness or something more? I do value my mental health & I am willing to take help if needed, I've been to a therapist for my Anxiety before & don't mind going back if it is needed.

77,Terrified that I'm going to crash and burn,"Last year, I was hospitalized six times for SI and various comorbid conditions. I had to take the Fall semester off of school, postponing my graduation by a year, and after my fourth hospitalization I started a partial hospitalization program where I went to a group therapy place 6 hours a day, five days a week. And it worked! That was my second IOP/PHP clinic, and I really did well there. I had 2 hospitalizations while I was there, but those were triggered by a med problem, and they were back to back because the first place really messed with my meds (withheld various non-psych meds with no tapering because they ""made me impulsive""). So really it was just one slip.

I got dropped down to IOP (3 hours a day, 4 days a week) at the end of December. And now I just graduated the program entirely. I do outpatient therapy once a week for a bit, then every other week, then once a month... Until I'm done entirely.

And it feels good, yeah. I'm proud of myself for coming this far, for all the progress I've made. I technically did the PHP program twice, but I only did 8 weeks of a 16-week IOP program, so it kinda adds up. I'm not nearly as suicidal now, which is awesome.

But mood wise... I don't feel much different. I'm struggling to manage all aspects of my life, and it's not even that hard - I'm taking a reduced course load, I'm only involved in one extra curricular that meets weekly and doesn't require more than 30 minutes of time each day, I have loads of time to spare. And yet I'm always behind on school, I lose track of time and can't do what I need to for the extracurricular, I don't have time to practice any self care beyond brushing my teeth and washing my face and maybe taking a shower 2-3 times a week. I'm not happy, I'm stressed but also numb to so many things, I don't get actual enjoyment out of anything anymore. 

I was just diagnosed with ADHD and I'm starting meds for that soon, so I'm hoping that will help some. But it won't make me any happier. I've tried so many meds and mood stabilizers, I have adverse reactions to most of them and the ones I don't, well, they don't really work all that well. If anything they make me worse; the lithium and Seroquel have slowed my processing speed down, I'm tired all the time, my appetite is all over the place, some of my therapists think that it's made me too numb now. The only benefits have maybe been with sleep because without them I do frequently pull all nighters, but it's an overcorrection because now I want to sleep all the time.

I dunno. It feels like I'm still on the edge. Yeah, I don't have one foot hanging off anymore, but I'm still only one or two steps away from that. And I keep telling myself, just make it until next semester when I go in person and can join more clubs and do more stuff, but I know I'm just avoiding being home alone with my thoughts, much like I am now. My friends from IOP are all doing things, clubs, school, hanging out with friends. They're too busy to talk to me most of the time, but they're the only connection I have. I'm just barely hanging on, and yet I still have six months before I can do all the stuff they're doing. At the very least IOP gave me something to get up for everyday. Now all I have is classes that I'm always behind on and one extracurricular commitment that somehow seems too overwhelming. No friends, no one to talk to my age, at least not in person. No place to hang out at. No experiences or memories being made.

And yet all it takes is one slip, and back to PHP I go. 8 weeks of that, then another 16 weeks of IOP. Worse, if that happens, I can say goodbye to a good first semester in the Fall because I'll be spending essentially 5 hours each day unable to do school or clubs (factoring in driving time). My mental health issues have fucked up a whole year of my life already, and here we are on year 2, just waiting to see if things will be as bad. Or worse.

I had all these dreams and expectations for what it would be like post-graduation. I thought I would feel at peace, or kind of happy. I guess I feel stable, but stable in the sense that I feel shitty all the time and it never changes. The only motivation I have right now is hope for a better future, but I start to wonder if that'll be disappointing, too. I'm taking it day by day but everything blends together because it's always the same. The most exciting part of my week is going to the grocery store and buying things that I won't ever eat. I live off of cereal, Oreos, and the occasional bagel (if I'm out of milk) or yogurt. I know, I need to eat better. But why waste time eating stuff that I hate the taste of when it probably won't make that much of a difference in the long run?

I've promised myself, just make it 10 years and if things are still shitty, and they've never gotten better, then I can consider other options. I'm going to try my best to make it those 10 years. But I'm scared nothing will change. Or things will change for the worse. I'm scared I'll relapse again, and again, and again, and I'll never really be out of this depressive hell hole. I'm scared my life will be forever postponed because of treatment that won't make any improvements overall. I'm scared of so many things, and yet at the same time, nothing scares me. If those things happen, will I even care? Will it even matter? Will my life make a difference anywhere at any point?

78,All about Anxiety Disorders and Depression among the Elderly," It  is normal to feel anxious when faced with gruesome situations once in a  while.

79,Pls read i guess,"Im 20 and boy I dont even know even know where to begin with this post. I mean I just discovered I had crippling OCD and now that I take the proper medication for it, it has just completely changed my life. It is possible l am a sociopath due to the fact I was raised by a psychopathic stepfather who relentlessly abused me physically, psychologically and with no shortage of verbal abuse. I am not proud of that fact but it sure makes a strong person. For this fact I want to become a psychiatrist who specializes in helping children whose mental health disorders are exacerbated by abuse. I am not currently in school as I was discharged from the Navy just this past December and have been just on a mental health break until now. I have just recently discovered my life goal and have been admitted to a local university to pursue this dream and hopefully get some extra help from the benefits of serving. I have technically resetted my social life so now I have 0 friends and looking for a job.
I would love to elaborate given the right questions as I cant formulate my life story into a short essay. Ive also liked to add ive been hospitalized for some horrendous suicidal ideations, went through 2 1/2 months of therapy, PHP then IOP and even still continued to have thoughts of taking my
life. However, a few long and hopeless months later, i was able to try reaching out for help again and met the right psychiatrist with the right medication and I am here I am typing this post.
The point of this post i guess is to answer questions about anything as i dont really have anyone to talk about it to, paired with hopes of possibly helping some people in their journey to a homeostatic life.

Ok...looking for advice from the younger generations here...

Older non-binary Bean here and kinda lost about what I think I'm feeling? I've had a rough week with financial troubles around and not much food to be found (having a bad month financially bc of other stuff that had come up). So we all have been hungry and cranky. Anyhow...

I have a friend that I know from PHP (I go Thurs and Fri) and we have become...let's just say close...VERY close. We haven't ""sealed the deal"" yet (please don't make me say it out loud lol) but we want to badly. I had seen him at the Mall yesterday (not planned) and we spent a long time talking and...well...making out I guess you young'uns would call it.

I can't stop thinking about...being with him but we have a scheduling nightmare going. Hard to get together. I can't stop thinking about his kiss...and how it felt to actually hold another man. My husband died almost a year ago (it will be 1 yr on May 10) so I am wondering what the hell am I feeling? I know it's a dumbass question people and that at 53 I should at least remember what being ""young"" and free means...but I'm not young anymore and I had been with the same man for 30+ years.

Any advice for someone just starting over in mid-life? Btw, this guy is 60 (so the same age as my husband had been when he'd passed) and a Boomer (I'm 53) so at least we are in the same general age area.

I forced my husband to go to a mental health triage center a few days ago, and after a minute they walked him to the ER because his plan to kill himself was detailed and extensively thought out. He was transferred to the mental health unit. I wasn’t able to see him until the next day. Very strict visiting hours 3:30-4:30. It was like visiting a prison and I felt so guilty for the conditions he had to live in, though it’s necessary. I returned today at 3:30 with a fresh pair of underwear, but apparently they only do visiting hour 3:30-4:30 on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. I drove over an hour to get there and I just wanted to give him a hug. I didn’t realize how important it was to me until I lost it, and then I snapped in the car. I screamed and cried harder than I have since my brother died. I want to scream and cry and puke and punch things and I’m so overwhelmed with all my emotions. I am in SO MUCH PAIN. And I don’t care that he’s where he needs to be, it still hurts so fucking much that I feel like the emotional pain I am in might kill me. And since they can’t start PHP until Tuesday they want to keep him even more days. It’s absolutely barbaric for everyone involved that only 3 hours of visitation is allowed per week.

87,"(Cross post, but not, cause I don't know how) Wife sent to Indiana, now her discharge date is being changed last minute","Full disclosure, I'm in the military, wife is civilian. She recently got sent to a facility in Indiana for depression. This facility specifically specializes in drug addictions, but they also do mental health, I guess. She wasn't on drugs so she was able to start the mental health program immediately. Her discharge date was set for next week, but today I just got a call from the facility telling me she's getting extended for two weeks on ""medical recommendation"" because their program is ""typically 45 days, not 30"".

That's including detox and some other thing that she didn't need. But because she agreed to ""full treatment"" they are saying she has to stay for 45 days, because ""everybody gets 45 days"". Then why did they send me the letter saying she was going to be done in 30? Why are they just now telling me, a week before she gets home? Am I missing something? Her therapist has told me my wife is doing wonderfully in all their sessions and is on track for the original discharge date.

For transparency, their contract for ""full treatment"" doesn't say anywhere ""45 days"" it just says ""upon medical recommendation"". Does anybody have experience with any of this? It just seems like they're trying to get more money from the insurance company to me. If my wife needs the extra time, maybe start off by saying that instead of ""well, this is how we have it set up"". And if that's the case, perhaps divulge that to the patient before signing the contract. 

I even asked the clinical director if she thought tricking her like this was good for my wife's mental health to which she responded ""We didn't trick her, she agreed to full treatment"" ""Yeah, which doesn't have an actual set amount of time, and according to your facility, would only be the PHP portion of the treatment."" ""It really is recommended everybody gets 45 days, whether that's with detox or just PHP"" ""Then maybe you should state in your contract ""a minimum of 45 days"" ""We don't do that because it's only a medical recommendation""

88,Light refracting off my eyelids or eyelashes,"First of all, I want to say that I have been to an optometrist. He found nothing wrong with my eyes and seemed stumped by my problem.

For the past few months, I’ve had a problem with my vision while watching TV. When my eyelids are partially closed, I would see a streak of light refracting off my eyelashes kind of like a lens flare whenever there was a bright area onscreen. At first, I only noticed it while watching TV in the dark, but now I see it even when I turn on the light. It's very annoying and distracting.

I’ve reduced my OLED pixel brightness setting from 50 to 40, which made the problem a bit more tolerable, but hasn’t solved it.

I’ve also tried changing my sitting position (slouching vs sitting up straight) but that hasn’t helped either.

I’ve even tried trimming my upper eyelashes, but I still see the lens flare effect whenever I watch TV. Maybe the short eyelash stubble left over is enough to cause the effect or maybe it was my eyelids, not my eyelashes that were causing the light streaks.

It’s possible that the light streaks have always been there, but I’ve never noticed them before and subconsciously tuned them out of my vision. Now that I have noticed them, I can’t unsee them, even when I try to focus on something else.

I’ve only found two people on the internet asking about a problem similar to mine:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/33rxok/my\_eyelashes\_are\_too\_long\_and\_i\_want\_to\_cut\_them/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/33rxok/my_eyelashes_are_too_long_and_i_want_to_cut_them/)

89,I got back from ed residential but all my work is going to waste,"I'm an almost 16 year old trans male. Last year I went to a general php. There I was diagnosed with an eatting disorder. They misdiagnosed me with anorexia even though my eatting habits have nothing to do with weight. They told me I should go to residential. My mom was against it, but me and my dad convinced her that I need it.

The php was a short time one(about 2 weeks) but I was there for a little over 6 weeks and than went to a iop while I was waiting for a spot.

Near July I got in and things were going ok. My ed was getting better and some other things as well. I wish it focused on other stuff and not just ed because ed is, by far, not my biggest problem. The place did make some things worse, but for the most part I was healing and on my way to recovery.

Less than a week ago i discharged. On the way home I asked my mom when I'll start an ed php. Thats when I received the news that they didnt except me and said im not ready to leave res. That would be fine but insurance olny cares about physical health not mental for res, so I didnt have a choice to leave or not.

The php said I wasn't ready because I couldn't hold a conversation and I was suicidal. I couldnt hold the conversation because the questions were hard, i didnt know how to answer them, and I was tired. As for being suicidal, I want to die, but I dont want to unlive myself, so im not really that.(right?)

So I was left with nothing. Just got out of residental, with no outpatient providers(my theripist moved.) I had nothing, and my family isnt very supportive.

My mom said how I didnt have ed at all(which I do) and that my habits were fine and normal for being deppresed. Which made me feel so invalid and not sick enough. I dont eat because of how it feels, not because im sad and i dont think 0 meals a day and binging once a week is healthy.

I thought that at least my parents would help me with my meal plan, but they didn't. They left me on my own and wouldn't help me plan or prep. My dad was better at it, but still I was relasping faster than I thought it would happen.

Also, I didnt try much becuase I have no other comfort other than an empty stomach.

While at res i noticed my dad was trying. (My parents just separated.) He took my ed more seriously and tried to become a better dad. He got understanding for mental health and my deppresion symptoms. When I came home he yelled at me for not cleaning my room even though I'm unmotivated and tired. He yelled at me for other dumb things to. Than he called me my mom even though my worst fear is becoming her.(she has bad anger problums and I have anger issues too) he called me ungrateful for not wanting to shop even though I was in pain.(I had my period and he knew that.)He also triggered my by yelling and banging.

So now im back to the start were both my parents dont care and I have no one to help me.

I dont know what to do. Res really helped but I know my mom will never let me go back becuse of how bad they are. Also even if im in a worse spot she will NEVER send me to inpatient.(she is a nurse and both) so I am stuck and need help.

90,WOW...2 breakthroughs in 24 hrs.,"Today is my 53rd birthday and just after midnight I had a huge breakthrough. I was widowed back in May of last year and since then I have discovered things about myself that have been hidden for 4 decades or more. Most are extremely private and I won't be divulging the details. One has to do with myself and how I am not looking for any kind of relationship with another person at all. There's another private part to that too that has to do with finding myself physically but it's mostly that I finally feel free from the shackles of marriage. 

I loved my hubby more than anything but I had married so young (I was 23) that I never really had the chance to find myself first. I literally went from child to married adult with not much room in there (I am also autistic so emotionally I'm far behind my actual age) to explore. I was in HS til 19, then went right to college, which I had f'ed up bc I'm an alcoholic and flunked out to being married in a few short years. I'm discovering that I really didn't enjoy being married for the past decade. We were married in 1994 so he died right before our 29th anniversary in July. I know that sounds horrible ... I feel horrible for thinking that.

The second breakthrough was personal and had to do with someone at my PHP saying something to me, hurting me deeply ... I had actually put on some meditation music and realized why I had been so hurt...thought about that... meditated on it...and was able to go talk to the person about why I felt that way and all that. She was very proud of me and it made me cry...in a good way. I never had such a breakthrough like that ever. 

I think this meditation thing really has something to it.

97,Post-Attempt Journal Entry,"**Context: A few months, I was in a dual diagnosis intensive outpatient program when I tried to OD. Extraordinarily, I woke up the next morning. I was moved to a higher level of care (partial hospitalization/PHP), and wrote this a few days later in my journal.**

I don’t know how to continue in PHP as if nothing ever happened. I wasn’t supposed to wake up last week. That wasn’t the plan. I don’t know why I woke up. But now I have a week and a half to figure my shit out. Not a week and a half to seek treatment. No, a week and a half to figure out if I want treatment at all. Maybe I’ll try six bags of dope this time. But how am I supposed to walk into rooms and talk about the joys of recovery, hope, meaning, or even just the day to day? I’m only here by chance. So what the fuck am I supposed to say? “Oh yeah, my anxiety is bad today. Also, I tried to off myself last week and it didn’t work so now I’m back in PHP even though I wish I never woke up at all.” People keep asking if I’m safe or suicidal, how am I supposed to answer that? Like yeah, but only the normal amount. I don’t have an imminent plan or anything, but I am certainly considering my options. I guess I’m resistant to treatment right now because I’m angry at the universe. I should have fucking died. Seriously though, it’s ridiculous to sit in PHP while people try to better themselves, meanwhile I’m here cursing out god or whoever for being alive. The disconnect is infuriating. Someone asked in group today if people have found a new meaning of life in sobriety. Like no! The fuck I haven’t. I’ve found that beneath the flaming dumpster fire of shit that was my life in active addiction there’s an explosive trainwreck in sobriety. I have found no reason to live, no happiness, no peace, no existential comfort. 

And to those who will tell me that I’m alive for a reason, let me be direct: I’m not alive because of some divine plan or intervention; I’m alive because my dealer sold me shitty drugs and I just so happened to not OD. God has nothing to do with this and fate is irrelevant. In fact, if there is a god out there I fucking hate them. I hate that I was born, I hate that I didn’t die at 13, I hate that I didn’t die a couple years ago, I hate that I didn’t die last week. Fuck god and fuck anyone who tells me there’s a higher reason. I'm a cosmic coincidence, my life isn’t special or important or consequential. It’s a tragedy of luck and bad choices. And now I’m stuck here for however long I’m alive.

While I physically woke up my recovery did not, nor my will to live, nor get better, nor any sense of purpose. I don’t know what help or support I am looking for. This is just one of many in a long string of desperate attempts to hold on. More literally, my brain is a tug of war between two thoughts:

1. For the love of god just let me die so this can be over.
2. Please help me. Someone help me. I need help. 

Take with that what you will, but I don’t know what I want or need right now. No matter what anyone says the other side will keep tugging. It never ends. Never. Not for my whole life. I’d be better off dead if not happy. Instead I’m neither. I’m a static point - a knife - held between life and death.

As for reasons to live, I can list off some superficial ones. My family and friends would be traumatized; they would miss me. My dog would never see me again, nor would I see him. I wouldn’t be able to fulfill any of my life goals: finding love, finishing college, having kids, doing advocacy work. But those are shitty reasons to stay alive. They say it’s selfish to kill yourself, but how much pain does a person have to endure before it becomes selfish to expect them to stick around? Besides, I’m poison. Sure, I am loved. But that’s less a reflection of me and more a reflection of others’ clemency. If you reduce me to my actions (my impact) I am a selfish, indulgent, piece of shit who takes from the world, exploiting others’ good will to assuage my suffering. I draw people into my black hole then take advantage of their care time and time again, leaving claw marks where I should have let go. Everyone I say I love - who I believe I love - I hold hostage to my vices. So yeah, damned if I do, damned if I don’t. Do I let the gravity of my wounds pull others deeper as I try to stay alive, only to hurt them in the end? Or do I resign to this reality and take that final step to release myself and everyone else from a chokehold? There’s no right answer, it’s a lose-lose for everyone involved. 

I suppose I listed off reasons to live, so I might as well list reasons I want to die to balance it out. Broadly, I am just fucking miserable. I spend most days wishing I was dead, and the rest holding on to a fleeting hope. This isn’t to say that there aren’t any good or happy things in my life, only that they aren’t enough to overcome the enduring pain. Pain is probably the wrong word, actually. Because it is not pure pain, it’s the tug of war, the indecision. It seems that no matter what I do or what help I get or what meds I take there’s always a voice in my head telling me all sorts of shit. It’s a delusionally self destructive voice that I battle with constantly. And I’m tired… I’m just fucking tired. I think it’s first nature for most people to be alive - but not for me. It’s first nature for me to self sabotage, to die. You know, I never used drugs to feel good or to have fun. The opposite; I did drugs deliberately, as the worst decision imaginable. My addiction is not accidental. It is and always was intended as a prolonged suicide. I’ve stared at my drugs countless times debating if I should use them to get high or to kill myself. In retrospect, and even at the time, I recognize that there is no true difference beyond the associated timeline. I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 13 and things have only gone downhill since. As they say, beneath every rock bottom is a trapped door. I have found too many trapped doors to count - I am dejected. But with that dejection comes the recognition that I always give up and self sabotage midway through. I can’t say in all honesty that I’ve actually given myself a chance. But to me, that isn’t a glimmer of hope or possibility, it just reaffirms that positive outcomes are unachievable for me. Because each time I’ve sought help I have truly done my best. Granted, my best wasn’t durable enough to sustain long-term, but it was my best nonetheless. So given that I’ve hit rock bottom and that I’ve tried to climb out of that hole cyclically, what else is there to do? My best isn’t good enough to get better, so why waste the time being alive? 

Further, my inner world infects those around me, so the issue is pressing. The longer I stick around and the more connections I make, the more people I hurt in the process and in the end. Let’s take \[redacted\], for instance: they’ve seen me overdose, they’ve talked me off bridges; they are a light in my life, I am a darkness in theirs. Of course, they would never admit that because they love me like a sister. But if you do the math, they would be better off if I wasn’t here. That is, if the two choices are dead or a danger, I’d rather be dead. I am a liability to those I love, and especially to those that love me. When I allow someone into my circle, I promise to break their heart slowly - death by a thousand cuts - only to crawl back into their life and beg for help again. And if they allow me back in I do it again and again and again until one of us breaks. I have a reaper in my head and a scythe in my head, ready and waiting for a victim. I hope to god that the victim ends up being me. If there were any justice in this world, people would cut me off to protect themselves. Instead, I’ve found that the opposite is true; people rush to help me. But there are certain people in this world you can’t help. Because while they are drowning, they will thrash and struggle and bring others down with them. That’s me. That’s Sam. I want others to drown with me so I’m not alone. But it would be better if I were alone - if I drowned. 

You know, there’s this ancient torture chamber called the Iron Maiden. The concept is that someone is placed standing in a human-sized box. There are spikes protruding from all sides, placing constant pressure on the victim. If the person moves the spikes pierce the skin, so they must stay utterly still at all times. The Iron Maiden combines pain with exhaustion in a perfect concoction from hell: the person can not sleep, nor is there an end in sight; they are deprived of their senses, trapped among spikes that are painful but not deadly. In a way, that’s how I feel. I am in a self-fulfilling Iron Maiden. If I move one direction, the tug of war, the spikes, bring me back center. There is no reprieve. But this constant shifting is never enough to kill me (or to kill myself), only enough to make me wince. I am so, so, tired. The only way out I see is to lunge into the spikes with enough force to end it for good. Maybe my fate is to die in the Iron Maiden.

The cruel irony is that I don’t want this to be my fate. I want to be a good person. I’ll even go so far as to say that I want to find a way to be alive. But this want is like a mirror in the Iron Maiden. It shows me every wince, every cut; I can’t escape my own reflection. Hell, even if I kill myself I have to watch myself do it. 

So let’s be practical for a minute. I have three options:

1. I can try and get better… again. I can do my best, and pray to a god that I don’t believe in that it’s enough this time. If it isn’t, I prolong the suffering of myself and everyone misfortunate enough to care about me. On the off chance I do recover, great. Problem solved. I don’t have enough hope - or maybe willpower - to fully commit to this option.
2. I can revert to using - to a prolonged suicide. This is perhaps the worst option, or maybe it’s the best. It will take me out eventually, and in the meantime I get to say goodbye. I can push away my loved ones until there’s no one left. And then when I’m alone - truly alone - it will happen.
3. I can kill myself. I can stop delaying a moment I’ve been anticipating for years and just fucking make a decision already. I can let the reaper win, and then the tug of war will stop. Finally, silence. I just want silence. In the process, I will traumatize my loved ones. But if it’s any consolation, I won’t be around to see that, and I’m traumatizing them anyways. 

Putting this on paper doesn’t make it any easier. If anything, it just serves as the basis for further inner conflict. Now there’s something concrete for the demons to argue about. Who knows, maybe this entry will become my turning point, my recovery log. On the flip side, it would also do well as a suicide note. So yeah, what else is there to say?",1716421604.0,False,1,1,FarGur3089,None,1cyeylm,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cyeylm/postattempt_journal_entry/

99,Sucks when nobody wants to help,"Cw: suicide

Can I just say for a second how effing sh*tty it feels to have a partial hospitalization program tell me I'm too broken and they won't help me? Like, ffs. It's not even based on how I'm doing right now, in this moment. It's because of a ""pervasive history"" of suicide attempts and some recent issues with food/sleep that I'm actively addressing and have been stabilizing. 

I'd reached out to them because my therapist recommended it to avoid things going downhill further and reaching the point of needing inpatient. My therapist and I agree that it's not necessary at this time. But the PHP won't take me unless I spend time in *residential* not even just inpatient. 

But! Catch this! A TMS clinic I'm talking to as well isn't sure they can convince insurance to cover TMS because so much of my history isn't recent enough and as such doesn't count towards insurance requirements. 🙃 and my meds Dr is running out of med options to try because of various past experiences and health risks.

100,I feel like I’m missing out on life because I’m getting treatment,"I’ve spent the past year and a half in higher levels of care. Last summer I was hospitalized for a SA. I was in residential for months, then PHP and IOP. I still struggle with SI and my eating disorder is still very loud. 

Prior to being hospitalized, I was living alone, working full time, and had a pretty good social life. Since I was discharged from the hospital, I have been living with family. Initially it was just a temporary safety precaution because (understandably) no one was comfortable with me being alone. But because I’ve been in intensive treatment for so long, I haven’t had an income and can’t afford to live anywhere other than with family. 

I feel like I’m missing out on so much. I’m 26, and feel like I completely wasted my 20’s. The first few years of my 20’s I was in an abusive relationship. When we split, I finally started living the way I wanted to, going out and having fun. Unfortunately, there was just a lot of trauma that was building up in the background and became too much. 

I regret getting treatment though. I functioned for such a long time having SI but still going to work and acting normal. I feel like I outed myself by getting hospitalized and letting my family know about it, and now I can’t get out of treatment because too many people are involved and concerned for me.

I know that quitting before I’m stable wouldn’t work out well for me, and it isn’t sustainable for me to try to go back to “normal” life yet when I’m still struggling so much… I just feel like I’m watching everyone else still living their life and I’ve been on pause for a year and a half with no end in sight",1704160911.0,False,2,0,Mountain_Opposite659,None,18wdi56,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/18wdi56/i_feel_like_im_missing_out_on_life_because_im/

103,What do I do?,"Hi,

So I've struggled with severe depression and anxiety for a while now, and I was hospitalized (inpatient) for all of January, and I just finished a PHP program on Monday March 4.  

I also have a severe eating disorder that is causing me grief and stress.

&#x200B;

I was worried about finishing the PHP because of the lack of structure in my life again compared to during the PHP.  I was alright for a couple days, but now I'm starting to go downhill again, the suicidal thoughts are coming back strong and I feel like there's no hope.

&#x200B;

I really don't want to end up inpatient again, because that makes me feel like I failed at trying to take care of myself, and I also know that hospitalization is not a long term option.  You have to learn to use strategies and techniques to manage on your own (and also with therapy if needed). 

&#x200B;

I have an appointment with the psychiatrist from the PHP (follow up) next week and an intake appointment for services at a local youth and young adult mental health centre (also next week).  

&#x200B;

I just feel that I might do something stupid before then.  I was feeling really down this morning and decided to take my dog out for a walk to see if that would help, but I ended up planning to come home and overdose on pills.  I haven't done that obviously but the thoughts keep coming to my mind about overdosing.

&#x200B;

I'm also on the waitlist for some outpatient eating disorders programs in my area, but the waitlists are long (months). 

&#x200B;

I don't have insurance, or money to pay for a private therapist.  

&#x200B;

Luckily I'm in Canada, so hospital visits are covered by provincial health insurance, but as I said before, I would rather not go inpatient again. 

&#x200B;

I'm at a loss of what to do :(

104,i feel uncomfortable when my therapist is nice to me,"i know this is a pretty common situation but i’ll provide some background information. i’ve been at a PHP program for six months, which includes seeing an individual therapist twice a week. being in PHP, i see her every day which sometimes includes her hanging out with the clients, running into her in the halls, emergency check ins, or her joining my family sessions, so i know her pretty well. basic but important background info: i’m 18F and have “very severe” BPD, according to my therapist (and every doctor who’s ever met me). when i first got to the program, i was mean to everyone, including her. i yelled at her, had lots of “incidents”, even threatened suicide multiple times. my first week there she called me very manipulative. after losing my FP at the end of january (and a rough week following), i started to get really attached to her. i told her i was “favorite-personning” her, and while she was kind she was very direct about the fact that she would not give this too much attention or feed into it. my obsession grew, and soon i was talking about her to anyone who would listen and repeatedly telling her i loved her, that she’s perfect, that i wanted to move in with her, inappropriate things like that. she would joke around about it to some extent, and we did explore it a little bit, but during this time she was very strict about boundaries, not talking to me outside of sessions, not responding to my texts, it was what i needed and it was for the best but she was definitely not gentle or nurturing at all. about a month ago, my therapist and the clinical director sat me down and had an intervention with me. they told me she could no longer be my FP, and i had to let go of my obsession or they would have to switch my therapist. this was very painful as it felt like abandonment, but it was for the best. the FP relationship is very painful as my whole life revolves around one person and i constantly feel desperate, rejected, and abandoned. since then, i have become less and less attached to her and while i still care about her, it’s no longer obsession. our relationship is more appropriate and i respect her boundaries. but the way she behaves towards me has also changed. she is much more gentle, caring, expressing that she is very invested in helping me and wants the best for me. i feel more listened to, and she gives me more positive feedback. for example, today in session i got triggered by loud sirens and dissociated and got very anxious to the point i was barely responding. she responded very calmly and empathetically, asking what happened and “where i went”, and asking me to take a breath for her. at the end of the session she took me to the bathroom and had me splash cold water on my face. she made a point of emphasizing my strengths and telling me she is proud of me. i do appreciate this, but it makes me so uncomfortable. i feel like i don’t deserve it, and i’m so used to people yelling at me or insulting me or otherwise being cruel that it feels weird when she is nice to me. like i’m just waiting for the moment she’s going to snap and tell me she hates me and finally be sick of me. i keep expecting the worst, and yet she is nice every time. how do i work through this? how do i stop being uncomfortable with care and kindness and just accept it? i’m open to any advice or feedback.",1686783482.0,False,1,0,camthrowaway924,None,149lum5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/149lum5/i_feel_uncomfortable_when_my_therapist_is_nice_to/

106,My mom wants me to enter another treatment program I don’t see the point of it. ,"Hi thanks for this community and thanks for reading. 

I barely have enough energy to post this, so I’m sorry if this seems flat unemotional and short.

 I have really significant ptsd, eating disorder, and depression. my family, thankfully for them of course, doesn’t understand; I also feel like I have some kind of social disorder because I don’t always see a need to socialize. I just want to be with animals, they haven’t hurt me and haven’t caused me to have trauma. 

 I’ve been in five residential treatment programs. The last one left a negative mark, they prescribed the wrong medication I became really paranoid isolated and suicidal. Eventually I lost all my peer contacts on the milieu and called someone a mean name. 

I just want to say this is really out of character for me, and I even wrote a letter when I was clear headed asking for ADA accommodations. 9 days later I met with a “clinical manager” and they told me I was done with treatment, my CAT DIED (yes all during the same convo), and I was being sent home with no help or plan. ( I didn’t react well….at all and I’m terrified of leaving home for another res program. )

I left went home and entered into PHP at home a month later. That’s when I found out I was having a reaction to the new medicine the eating disorder res had me on. 

I’m still not doing great, some days are better than others, my mom wants me to get help so I can be happy and have a fulfilling life again. I don’t know if this can happen.

My main question is does anyone know of a unique long term residential that has housing and work or volunteer /vocational coaching attached to the program? I need a program that is laid back enough when you can swear, versed in trauma, and I would love to be able to work with equine therapy and animals. I have decent insurance and I can go to programs in other states. It does not need to be an ED program because I received tx for that ,

bf had a mental emergency and gf called the resident director because his parents asked her to. for context: parents are not supportive/did not understand the situation fully. the RD “helped” him and sent him in handcuffs to the er despite his willingness to go. after this: bf is traumatized asf, mad at gf, confused, and says he will talk to her when he’s ready. gf is sad and angry at the healthcare system bc she was the only person he told his SI and depressive thoughts to, and she did not know what to do. gf told bf’s friends about it and they are doing a nice job at checking in now that they are aware. bf sees this series of events as an attempt for gf to try to get him back and meddle with his life, while gf sees it as a crisis where she tried to do what she could to keep him from harming himself. 

bf asked to take a break before this, but stayed in contact with her. now bf wants full space and will reach out when he’s ready, but does not know if that’s fully fair to her. she’s unsure of how to apologize when she advocated against the police and hates that they traumatized him. they agreed on terms beforehand about what the break would be like (exclusive still) and they want to be together from my understanding. are they a lost cause? they want to put in the work to fix this. is gf in the wrong? what should she do better? who initiates contact first?

117,"Gratitude From the ""Burn-Out Generation"" 💭","I'm a 23 year old PhD student in the UK studying Physics.

I land squarely in the ""burn-out generation"".  
the radical polarisation generation.  
the global warming victims generation.

I'm sure there's more where that came from, but I'm writing this post as an antidote to the rhetoric that my generation can easily be packaged with.I'm fine with numbers, and to a certain extent words, they can be left in place as immovable records until they're intentionally removed or forgotten.   
The power of recording a thought which may have passed in and out of consciousness can't be understated for anyone.  
This is why I'm breaking one of my internet rules (don't post, just watch), and leaving this here for as long as there's servers for it to live on and eyes to see it. This post is about **Gratitude Journaling**

How can we take back control of our own happiness and fortify our minds to the negativity that the world wants to bundle us into sometimes? For me, it has helped immeasurably to **practice gratitude**. It's not as sexy as changing what you eat, or buying into an expensive brand of self-help. But it works, and I feel it's effectiveness has been criminally under-reported in comparison to the storm of other complicated advice it contends with.

Here's some science which agrees (Gratitude actually has the most clinical evidence to back it up when compared with any other mental health practice): [https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/postings/2021/11/practicing-gratitude.php#:\~:text=%22Expressing%20gratitude%20can%20positively%20change,%2C%20and%20well%2Dbeing.%E2%80%9D](https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/postings/2021/11/practicing-gratitude.php#:~:text=%22Expressing%20gratitude%20can%20positively%20change,%2C%20and%20well%2Dbeing.%E2%80%9D)  
[https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2014-38568-001](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2014-38568-001)  
[https://www.proquest.com/docview/1114670352](https://www.proquest.com/docview/1114670352)

I implore anyone who has made it this far into the post to give it a try, **write down something you're grateful for every day**. Make it specific and short, I made an online journal (as a coding project) for recording my own gratitude and shared it with a couple of friends. Obviously you could also just use a book (this really might be better and less distracting).  
[https://appreciatemy.day](https://appreciatemy.day)

It's not a social media, but I want people to be able to share the practice of gratitude with each-other in a non-intrusive way and inspire others to pick up short form gratitude journaling. One of the best things we can all do for each-other is help ourselves and pay the benefits forward.

So I guess this rambling post is a kind of call to action. Give gratitude journaling a try if you haven't already, and maybe tell a friend to give it a go!

There's a pile of evidence to show that it has numerous benefits, and I can speak to the fact that it has pretty much changed my life. Happiness wasn't really something I could just go and do, it's like a quiet habit of being more content with the world that I live in. Ironically I think this contentment with appreciating things I can't control has given me more control in the world around me...

118,I don’t know if I can do this anymore.,"I’ve tried everything and I can’t do this anymore.

I’m 23, non-binary. In 2022 I left college due to mental health (eating disorder but also significant depression and anxiety and found out I also have ADHD).
I don’t even really have the motivation to write this post so I’ll try to give all relevant info while still keeping it short. 
I’ve been to inpatient, residential, PHP, IOP, and I’ve had periods where I was just seeing an outpatient team. Right now my ED (anorexia) is not super bad (basically I’m still struggling but I’m maintaining a healthy weight) and I’m in IOP in an ED program.


I’ve tried so many meds. Like almost everything I’ve heard of, I’ve tried. I’ve done TMS (regular and deep), intranasal ketamine/Spravato, and I’ve had 2 rounds of acute ECT (bitemporal). ECT was initially helpful but fucked with my memory so bad and all the benefits seem to have worn off.
I just don’t think I can do this much longer. I don’t have the motivation to get out of my bed most days but I have to either because my parents make me (moved back in with them when I had to leave college) or because I have IOP/some kind of appointment. I need to get a job and submit all my re-entry stuff for school so I can get my degree. But I just simply can’t. 


I have a lot of bottles of meds and I can’t seem to get any definite answers online which would be most likely to kill me. I’m not planning on doing anything tonight/in the near future but like if I just literally take every pill I have and wash it down with some liquor that’s gotta work right? I’m really scared of not dying and being permanently damaged in some way bc of a failed attempt.
I am just really struggling and my therapist doesn’t even really know what to do with me. I don’t want to hurt people but that’s basically the only reason why I’m alive (besides fear that it won’t work and lack of motivation to do anything including writing notes to important people in my life and making sure someone will be able to take care of my cat)

123,"Please, help me.","Hello, I’ll try to be as brief as possible while making sure not to leave out the key points. I’m 28, living in Colorado, moved here a couple of years ago from the Midwest. I am a first-responder, a minority, and have struggled with aspects of mental illness my entire life but I feel as if my last traumatic event is my last, it truly feels that way.

I have dealt with aspects of anxiety and depression my entire life, they blew up in high school to the point where I lost a severe amount of weight and would isolate myself until senior year. I have always been fairly popular or at least liked-enough despite that. I attended two colleges, I have quit more things than I would like to admit due to anxiety or depression and have just started a trio of meds this past year after trialing seemingly an endless amount (now taking Lamictal, Venladaxine ER, Adderall ER) they seem to numb my emotions but I still feel deep depression and it comes to a head physically and overcomes the meds during very stressful events.

It feels and if I have self-sabotaged my entire life, I have tried therapy, PHP (which made me feel better because I was the most “normal” out of everyone there, making my problems feel lesser in a way), a multitude of meds, everything.

I feel like a massive burden to my father who is my best friend and has been on my side through this all, threats of suicide, going ‘off the grid’ for days, manic calls, I feel terrible. I would like to believe I am a Christian but I don’t feel worth of anyone’s love especially God’s. I truly despise myself and constantly self-sabotage. Because of this, I have lost opportunities, friends, and had seriously affected my intimate relationships negatively. Recently, the girl who I dated who I was and still am deeply in love with ended our relationship because of my behavior and beliefs (blatantly ignorant due to self-sabotage). I believe that this might be the final blow for me, I have been given every tool and opportunity to succeed in life and overcome my mental illnesses… why am I such a ‘cancer’ of a person.

127,I just got out of a Partial Hospitalization Program and all I can think about is harming myself to find a way back in.,"I am going on 30 but I have had major depression and suicidal thoughts since I was about 15.  I've spent my entire adult life ""managing"" my depression by suppressing all emotions under a cloud of ""I don't care"".  Not just happy or sad but really anything in life.  If you asked me for my opinion on any topic I'd probably say I don't care.  Naturally I've completely isolated myself from any real human connections on an emotional level, even my family.


So, I start PHP and opened up a lot to the therapists there, and surprisingly in the group therapy settings as well.  After holding every thing in for so long and lacking real emotional connection it makes sense that it would feel really good to open up towards people who seem like they care and or people who can relate with me.  I would say 2 weeks of PHP was life changing for me, the entire experience of therapy as well as everything I learned CBT/DBT wise and coping skills, etc.


Now, I am about two weeks out and I have continued going to IOP as well as seen an individual therapist but it's all at a different facility, different staff, and I'm just not feeling the same connection here.


I think what I have realized is I didn't learn coping skills in PHP.. they WERE my coping skills.  I am craving that feeling of being able to talk to them again.  I am having increasingly frequent thoughts (fantasies even) about how awesome it would be if I killed myself so I could go back there and see them.  Which, if you stop to think about it for even more than half a second, doesn't even make sense lol.  I don't feel like I have any intentions of actually hurting myself right now but I spend most of my days lately daydreaming about how I can go back.

I'm also nonbinary, have misophonia, and I'm too probably getting a diagnosis for autism soon too. (I personally don't think a diagnosis matters itself, but how it explains things and if it will help me understand myself. Just wanted to include them for background?)

All of my symptoms combine and it feels so shitty. I just feel so lost and hopeless, because I just keep feeling worse and nothing seems to help? I've done OCD PHP and IOP, and eating disorder PHP and outpatient therapy for multiple years, but I'm just really struggling.

In those groups, a lot of it was just facts about OCD/eating disorders and exposure/CBT. What frustrates me is I know everything they are talking about and what I'm supposed to do. I understand it, but it's like something doesn't click? Also with my OCD, so much of it is mental and automatic, and I feel exposures just are hard to tailor to the way my brain works. So it almost seems like a waste of time trying to get those modalities to ""work""

Another part is I feel like I just can't connect or providers/other patients don't understand me - some of which is probably logical (like being NB and having an eating disorder) but I also understand how some of it isn't. 

My therapist and I have been talking about doing a residential program and I'm really not sure how much it would help (I'm not sure how much of this is the depression talking and how much it's actually me). A huge problem either way is that I feel like I won't get anywhere if I'm not ready to accept my thoughts and myself, and be okay with me being me. I know I want to get better/feel better, but at the same time I'm worried I almost want to get worse so that I can ""prove"" something (I don't know what?) or just get the courage to end this pain.

139,I'm getting worse the more I explore. I'm afraid I'm slowly losing control,"Hi, my name is Phil, and I have schizoaffective disorder, bpd, ptsd, and general anxiety. I've had a few breakdowns in my life but have always been able to flip and switch and carry on to be ""normal"" - working, socializing, dating, exercising, etc. Unfortunately, it always comes back to the breakdowns, and they get worse each time.

This current patch I've been going through had me realize that my state of normalcy has always been repression. The lack of emotions, apathy, sociopathic behaviors, etc. are all ways for me to unhealthily cope with my conditions. As I recognized this, I decided to explore on trying to open myself up to emotions this time around.

It's not going well. My mood is unstable as hell. I'm impulsive as ever. I can't hold a basic conversation in person. I haven't worked in over 2 years. I have no friends irl (tbf I do have a few online friends). I feel like I'm slowly losing control of myself. This isn't for a lack of trying though. When I got out of residential last year, I started going to meetups, played rec sports, joined Discord/gaming groups, went on dates, practiced my skills, went on hikes, joined a gym, picked up an instrument, trained to be a volunteer, joined support groups, and so much more. Of course, I continued to see an outpatient therapist and a psychiatrist. Yet here I am. Alone and insane.

After my recent hospitalization due to mania, my therapist has suggested that I go back into higher care, but I already know what to expect. Higher level of care no longer does anything for me other than provide structure and imprisonment. Rogers, Sheppard Pratt, or any other hospital program will regurgitate DBT (rarely RO-DBT), a little CBT, and exposure work down your throat as if it's the cure-all for everything. If you're not familiar with skills, yes, these programs can be helpful. However if you've already been through these multiple times via inpatient/residential/php/iop, it simply becomes a waste of money. Then of course there are things like TMS, ECT, and ketamine that can relieve symptoms temporarily from time to time. Unfortunately, nothing has worked for me.

So, where do I go from here? Keep trying while I see myself slowly deteriorate into an uncontrollable thing? Maybe flip back into repression mode again for things to get even worse later? I guess I'm just tired. I want to live but don't care to live if this is what I am destined for. I suppose we can't predict the future, but repeated patterns aren't simply coincidental occurrences.",1703316059.0,False,8,2,ToiletOfGold,None,18p0dez,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/18p0dez/im_getting_worse_the_more_i_explore_im_afraid_im/

141,Just tired as per usual,"I'm just dropping a vent because I am tired

I've been diagnosed with Bipolar II and ADHD. It's just hard. I feel like I am 'imagining it'? ie, I start to feel like I'm not really 'sick' but just floating in a weird space and/or that I'm somehow 'making' myself ill??

I keep sabotaging myself. I keep telling my doctor(s) and my (ex)Coworkers that I am doing okay, but really I feel like I am spiraling and I don't know what to do.

Earlier this month I was supposed to go into a PHP, but bc my parent's (my abusers) had me on their insurance under my old name, I wasn't able to get admitted. The insurance refused to change my name without my parent's involvement, which then triggered me having nightmares for the whole beginning of August.

To top this off, I had denied to my doctor and DVR that I was having mood episodes?? Mainly because I was having a lot of trauma reactions, so I just assumed that the new Bipolar II diagnosis was incorrect.

During the diagnostics with the psychologist, we had a bit of a disagreement because they just diagnosed me with Bipolar II, but I argued because I had a past history of abuse that I wasn't sure if that diagnosis was correct, or a complete diagnosis. Mainly because they mentioned Bipolar tends to have a up, down, and 'middle' period, which I was trying to argue was not entirely what was happening (even when my mood/energy level is 'stable', I still have impulse issues, anxiety, and general instability). I began to have some sort of weird flashback halfway between our conversation, so I just agreed with everything so I could avoid passing out (my vision was shaking really hardcore at this point). Like, when certain topics veer off into abuse or something that reminds me of a traumatic event, I start to get really dizzy. My vision/the world begins to shake. 

Some background to this response: I started getting treatment at 16 for mental health issues, but the treatment still involved my parents and the doctors I had weren't really the best? So I had very extreme reactions to medication as well as experiencing abuse through treatment, which is why I think I reacted so strongly to the re-diagnosis of Bipolar?? But even then, I just feel so frustrated because my symptoms are so confusing to me, and I feel a certain amount of terror when I think of going on medication, even though I really think I need it. Top it off, I was started on an SSRI about 2 months ago and I think it made me go into some kind of manic/hypomanic episode?? It was especially noticeable this past week, I still felt like crap, but I had such a high intensity of energy that I just completed a bunch of appointments and tasks. So now I feel so stupid and embarrassed because I got myself involved with a bunch of job training related programs plus school thinking I was 'fine', and now am back to having a depressed episode and I don't know what to do now.

I can't go into the PHP hospital because of the insurance issue, so now its just a waiting game until I'm homeless? I guess? I just can't help but feel this is my fault once more

I don't know, I'm just hoping if I wait that I will feel better soon, but I'm just so tired and frustrated at myself because I can't make up my own mind, and I am so confused as to what I am experiencing and going through and I feel even worse",1661738190.0,False,1,1,satansbadfanfic,None,x0cfyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/x0cfyw/just_tired_as_per_usual/

i want to know why i do this. i haven’t been diagnosed (i don’t think?) with GAD or a depression disorder but mental illness runs the family. as a child i would have violent outbursts (destroying my room, hitting and biting people, etc.) recently that’s changed into hallucinations and vivid memories of things i don’t remember happening. unsure. which caused me to plan to attempt around october of last year. after i admitted to everything i was put in a php program. in the hospital as i was getting reevaluated i had a similar experience where i started rocking back and worth crying breathing fast and scratching everywhere as hard as possible.

149,Mental Health Industry is making me worse,"About three years ago I woke my wife up at midnight to tell her my thoughts are dark, I was scared and I need help.

Since then we have run the gamut of trying to get appointments with therapists and even more difficult, a psychiatrist (even a PHP program). It seems at each turn these places/facilities are short staffed, uninformed to documentation needed for disability, dismissive and dollar driven. After all these are still all companies. So after three years of disappointments that hurt so much worse than the usual ones I think I have to stop seeking help. 

Some may agree, others not. But what are your thoughts that me asking for help in some ways was the worst thing I have ever done. Previous to that I hid it for years and life was at least consistent.

150,I want to talk about my attempt,"I wrote a 27 page suicide note composed of 11 chapters (including an introduction and conclusion) detailing every reason why I wanted to kill myself. I worked on it for 3 months and I didn’t hold anything back. Every repulsive and grotesque thought, every ounce of hatred I felt for the people in my life, graphics descriptions of my self harm, I wrote about all of it. 

I overdosed, taking 76 dextromethorphan (a drug I was abusing prior to the attempt) tablets, 30 mg each. And as you can tell, I survived. My coworker found me and called 911. In fact, I never even came close to dying. All the hospital had to do was give me Ativan because I was tripping balls and having leg tremors. My family was devastated, my note scared the shit out of everyone, and I’ve been bouncing between treatment centers ever since. I overdosed October 20th and I’m in a PHP program now, not set to discharge until after Christmas. Even though I went through hell to get here, I’m happy with the way things turned out and I’m glad I’m finally getting help. I’ve been diagnosed with BPD, prescribed several different medications, do intensive therapy for hours everyday, found Buddhism, and overall, I’m hopeful about the future. I don’t even want to be happy anymore, I feel like happiness is a little ambitious for me right now. So my goal is just to be normal. Neither happy nor unhappy, just content. 

But I can’t shake how I felt in the moments after I took all those pills. When it started to hit (after less than 10 minutes) I became extremely nauseous and started violently vomiting while at work. Of course, I was sent home and I laid down to die in the back of my car. I was so tired, all I wanted to do was sleep. In those moments where I closed my eyes and allowed the tactile hallucinations from the drug rock me to sleep, I was totally and utterly at peace. I wasn’t afraid, I had no regrets, no desire to experience anything again, I was ready to die. Not only had I accepted my imminent death, I welcomed it wholeheartedly. 

I hear about people self-aborting attempts because they realize somewhere along the way that they do want to live and I wonder why that didn’t happen to me. It’s not like it was too late, I could’ve gone back inside and told one of my coworkers what I did, the hospital was right across the street from my job.

My little sister was born with a condition called subcortical band heterotopia which gave her autism, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, etc. She cannot care for herself or really speak.

I couldn’t eat something unless she would, I couldn’t go out unless she could, I couldn’t talk if she didn’t want me too.

Which I can’t deny is true. Some how I was insulted by this and angry that she said that. I am trying to unpack all of this because I don’t fully understand why.

I wished for death for so long. And thought about how I could kill myself. Never a plan but just passing ideas.

And that if I did die I didn’t want to do it in my apartment because I didn’t know how long it would be before I was found and didn’t want my cat to suffer.

159,"I want to learn new things, but I fail and get anxious and depressed","I am someone who loves to learn new things and get capable to do things that I find interest in on my own. In 2013, I started learning a new language ie. Arabic. All my friends who started at the same time learned Arabic with just 1 course, but I took 4 courses since then yet my Arabic is rudimentary. 

Similarly, now I want to learn web development to a fair extent. But I don't get time, so the list of things that I need to learn to get sorted bothers me. I have to learn photoshop for design, then HTML, CSS, then some PHP etc to get my thing sorted.

160,How COVID-19 WFH Measures Are Affecting Your Mental Health and How You Can Maintain Your Sanity,"One day we were at work with no worries. Then out of nowhere, Coronavirus took the country by storm. Offices and schools were abruptly closed, businesses were shut down, flights were cancelled, and we transitioned to a remote work environment. At first, it seemed great! No commute every day saved us time and money. Not having to deal with our boss in-person. Spending more time with family.


Then after a month or so, many started missing being in the office. There’s something to be said about getting out of the house every day and having social encounters with others. Being exposed to new environments and meeting new people keeps us agile and fresh. Even outside of a professional setting, being cooped up prevents us from trying new restaurants, hitting the town and traveling.

164,"My psychiatrist just left me and I'm at a loss. Advice please! (18f, USA)","Yesterday I got a letter from my psyhiatrist's office saying that they were terminating our relationship and would no longer see me, due to their belief that I need a higher level of care than what they can provide in their clinic.

I'm not on antidepressants anymore as they caused so many side effects and just made me feel shitty. Personally, I have a ton of trouble with pills, so when I last talked to my therapist, we talked about bringing up alternative med routes, such as IV or injection options. So I did just that at my last psychiatry appointment and I guess after that that's when they decided they couldn't put up with me anymore.

So now I'm at a complete loss. I can't get a ""higher level of care"" as my health is to poor physically (was literally denied residential twice for this reason), and I had tried to look into virtual IOP, but was told that they wouldn't allow me to do their programing, as they said I was to mentally ill and needed residential. 

\*\*\*

What are some alternatives to psychiatry that are good ways to get help for BPD? Holistic medicine maybe? 

I'm honestly so sick of psychiatrists. I've been through quite a few, and it's nearly always the same thing. \*Medical history, ""mhm mhm, here's your pills, bye"" \* Rarely am I asked what I think would help me, or given the light of day. They often make me want to die more because of their invalidation

My big issue right now is that I'm currently going through the process of trying to get SSI, primarily due to the fact that I can't work due to high fatigue levels and other symptoms from CFS/ME (my primary physical chronic illness), which is not at all easy. The government wants to see proof of ""real, by the book"" treatments. So going the holistic route may end up damaging the probability of winning my case. 

My therapist is great, but once a week therapy all by itself with nothing else is just not enough. 

Any advice, support, suggestions?

165,Why can’t I communicate?,"I can’t communicate my feelings. Not even to my mom. I don’t want to feel like a burden. I don’t want to get yelled at. Even the slightest tone of anger from someone gets me upset. Mainly from my mom. I don’t like being told I did something wrong. I don’t want to be yelled at.  Sometimes I wonder what’s wrong with me.

I’m in the PHP program. It’s supposed to help me communicate my feelings. They try to help but when I try, it doesn’t work. I’m too scared. I can’t. I don’t want to get yelled at. 

My mom asks me why I can’t just tell her how I feel. I tell her it’s because I don’t want to make her stressed. Which is true. And she asks what she did to me to make me like this? She’s done so much and doesn’t realize how it’s affected my mental health. It’s been at least 5 months since she’s been like “that”, but it still hurts. Shes apologized but it still is carved into my brain. How could I ever forget the words she said?

Writing it down is easy, but telling my mom or even have the courage to show this to my mom is hard. I can’t. I can’t do it. I’m afraid.",1638752484.0,False,6,1,AvaCatHasQuestions,None,r9ugae,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/r9ugae/why_cant_i_communicate/

However, I have some good news. I got a job yesterday within walking distance of my apartment. It's been hard for me to get a job and this was just amazing to hear I can start later today.

Also, I have had a hard time getting a therapist in my new city/state and when I went to see my dietitian, she brought me over to patient assistance and helped me get in contact with the programs they have (not therapy, still on the list though). I just got the call to come in for an intake for either IOP or PHP before my shift starts.

I've had a tough year last year. I moved in January to a place with a racists/homophobic jerk. Moved away in July to stay with friend's for like 2 months before having to leave (their lease didn't like me being there) and I was homeless for a bit. Then my dad helped me find a place near where he lives in the midwest and I moved my plane landed on November 24, 2021 and I got to my place at like 2am on Thanksgiving.

Last year was hectic and I am just glad to finally have a stable place to live with a great landlord and amazing neighbors. I am just happy for once.

171,This is why.,"I’ll start off by saying this. I don’t feel comfortable telling my my feelings/really communicating in any way because mom was mentally abusive. She is better now and it’s been at least 5 months. The words she said still live in my brain in a dark place. I can never forget what she did. 

I don’t like to talk to her because before, I did try to communicate. I wrote notes and tried verbally. But I never got heard. She just would get mad at me or yell about how “What about me!?” Or just tell me I’m wrong and how she can do what she wants. She made me feel belittled. She always said,” So now you’re going to tell me how bad of a mom I am?” 

Now, I am in a PHP program because I’m too afraid to tell my mom about anything. I don’t want To get yelled at. I don’t want to get hurt again. I hid my suicidal feelings and now that my mom knows, she actually WANTS to know how I feel. But I can’t tell her. Im too scared. I can’t trust her.

Today, I tried to communicate. For the first time in awhile. I used the communication journal my therapist recommended. I wrote how I felt and handed it to my mom. But the thing is. Mom mom should really consider thinking before she speaks. I know it sounds like a bitchy thing to say, But it’s true. She said “So now you’re going to insult me?” Those type of words are exactly why I don’t talk to her.",1638837935.0,False,3,5,AvaCatHasQuestions,None,rameg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/rameg1/this_is_why/
172,What to do when your spouse doesn't think they need therapy/medications but you do?,"My wife has been through a lot physically the past 3 months (C Diff, out of work, diverticulitis, malnutrition, GI issues) just many many things that built up. She's always had anxiety, especially about medical/illness, so when this all began it just ran her mind through a loop of things like pain but trying to figure out if it's anxiety or something serious or something minor but exacerbated by anxiety.  She hasn't been on anything for her anxiety and panic in a long time and even when she was taking something, it's such a small dose that it didn't do much.

Anyway, throughout the whole three months, she has been running to the ER at least 20 times for things that were very minor, or at least not something you go to the ER for, but rather her primary and GI for. But she didn't like that she would have to wait for them and would treat the ER like her same-day results laboratory (even though I know and have told her that there's urgent care for that too, but to her she felt she needed to be in a hospital being monitored.)

Thankfully, the physical has all wound down to where she isn't symptomatic, just trying to replenish her body since it's been through so much. However, when it comes to the psychological, she has been avoiding it at all costs. It has taken me calling for an evaluation team for her to go through seeing her psychologist ( and not really an established one at that).  There's more to the whole picture, like physically preventing me from going to work on certain days because she's begging me to take her to the ER, taking my keys and hiding them, turning off my morning alarms.  Just....things that a grown adult shouldn't do, no matter how serious they think what they feel is.  And it's not like I keep her there with me, I tell her she can go to the ER, even take an ambulance, we're already over a thousand in ER bills (god bless insurance).

Sorry, I'm rambling, but even before all this I felt she needed therapy and medication because she can never be alone at home or anywhere for too long without me because she feels that something is going to happen and that no one is there if she passes out.  She's never had any serious condition before this, so it was just irrational to think that way.  She's 31yo.

So, now to where things are calming, she's seen her GI, she's seen her primary, she's no longer symptomatic, but we all feel (me, her medical team, her family who has been in the loop with everything going on) we all feel that she needs help with the psychological side.  She has the opportunity to do a partial hospitalization program, but she says no PHP.  She saw the psychologist Tuesday who said she needs a PHP because it's been too much on her and she needs something to keep her occupied and onto the best medication to ease her back into going to work and dealing with life.

However, my wife is pushing back, says she doesn't want to do that and says she will think of something but hasn't come up with a plan.  She has been coming to work and sitting in my car while I'm at work because she can't be alone. She says she won't on Monday, but words/promises have been broken in the past and there hasn't been a day in 3 months where she didn't want to go to an ER or talk about seeing a new doctor or new GI to get things going faster.

I'm conflicted because no one is going to force her to do anything, but I feel she isn't doing enough to help the mental side. I think she needs the PHP, but I've exhausted encouraging her and I'm just at a loss.  Ideally, she wants to stay with a family member who is home 24/7 to be with them until she feels better to go back to work, but no one is willing because of the things she has pulled in the past to try to have them take her to the ER when I wouldn't. She blames me for that and says that I pitted everyone against her and made them all get on my side about the PHP.  I just....have no idea how to combat that except throw up my arms and have her figure things out on her own.

And I mean, that would be fine if she would do these things on her own, but she doesn't because she says she can't be alone.  She doesn't drive but I say for her to Uber, taxi, public transportation. But then it's a guilt trip on how she's going to be alone, and doing this or that because no one will help her.  It's just, if I do the things, I'm enabling, if I don't it's an entire night of hearing this sort of stuff that just messes with the mind and emotions so much.

It shouldn't have to be this hard.

173,treatment resistant?,"hello. i’m not sure if this is the right place for this, and if it isnt please let me know & perhaps show a subreddit that is the right place. 

i am a 16 yr old who has been struggling with severe depression and anxiety since around the age of 10. i have been on antidepressants for as long as i can remember. i was on prozac for years with no noticeable changes after increasing my amount to as much as i could have. in 2016 i went to a PHP and they added buspar to the prozac and that seemed to be working well until it wasnt. i had a suicide attempt in june of 2017 and that hospital put me on lexapro. lexapro made me the worst person you could ever meet. i was put onto zoloft when we realized the lexapro was the cause of my sudden behavioral issues. at the start of 2019, we added buspar with my zoloft because i felt that buspar had worked the most for me at the time. as of now i am still on buspar & zoloft. 

i dont quite know how to describe my relationship with medications. i’ve always known these pills werent “cures” so i always assumed me still feeling so sad on these medications were normal. i struggle with the question of if my medications are working because i truly believe i have yet to find a medication that works, so i dont know what it feels like.

within the last few months i’ve pondered with the idea that maybe i have treatment resistant depression & i’d like to hear other peoples experiences. i am still severely depressed and live with constant suicidal ideations. is this what it feels like for a medication to work? do you still feel suicidal on meds? i have been in PHP 3 times and an inpatient ward once. i have had one suicide attempt that was treated & that my family knows about, but the amount of times i ive done things hoping to die and just ended up waking up the next day are too many to count. the its like every time i believe my medication is working, and maybe the do for a little but the thoughts always return stronger than before. 

im reaching out because i need to start advocating for myself and taking my treatment into my own hands. my psychiatrist is a WEIRD ASS dude and i have 0 trust in him despite being with him for years. i plan to talk to my mom about getting a new one. within the past week, i have been consumed to suicidal thoughts and at my lowest point every single night. someone please help me understand if this is how im meant to feel.",1577068470.0,False,1,2,voidofme,None,eee94v,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/eee94v/treatment_resistant/
174,Going through it right now (this is long),"Hello all. I (23 F) have been diagnosed with MDD, PMDD, PTSD, anxiety, and I am currently on 50mg of Zoloft. I recently went to the ER for plans of suicide and start a dual-diagnosis PHP (partial hospitalization program)/ IOP (intensive outpatient program) tomorrow. A couple of days after the ER visit I started feeling not just fine, but great. I had a lot of energy and felt great at work while talking to my tables and made them laugh and got great tips (I am a server). It’s been about 5 days this has lasted and I almost felt like... I don’t need the program because I feel fine now!

This feeling is starting to fade away and today has dragged on. I have been evaluated by a psychiatrist and they do not diagnosed me with anything new but I feel so out of place. I feel so high during those days I feel great. Maybe I am just not used to being happy or maybe I am just overthinking. Has anyone had this experience with feeling stuck in their recovery? My meds are not helping and I feel stuck in therapy. Hopefully this program will help but I have a gut feeling I am misdiagnosed. Open to any thoughts or opinions.

I'm on 7 medications for my mental illnesses. I've been in the hospital over 30 times and every IOP/PHP they have. I've had ECT which has damaged my memory. I can't actually work because I'm in the hospital so much, and the stress of a job sends me flying into  a mood episode. I'm on disability and live with my parents. I told him I freelance art.

180,(USA) Is there anything like adult day care for mentally ill people and/or young adults? Looking for structure.,"Hi Reddit! I had great results coming to you in another mental health subreddit last year, so I'm trying again :) My wife is in her mid-30s with Dissociative Identity Disorder and Schizoaffective diagnoses. Bipolar 1, psychosis, plenty of paranoia, depression, PTSD -- the works. All from some extended childhood trauma. 

She's been in and out of hospitals for the last few years as needed, but she also gets steady treatment from a therapist and psychiatrist. PHP and IOP are great for her, but they're really limited in terms of time. They're over in a couple weeks, and she needs much more than that. The programming is definitely helpful, but the daily structure is the biggest help we think.

Her condition has worsened over the last few years, and part of what we're learning with the hospital visits is that with structure, her life and wellbeing are far better. Her therapist recently mentioned adult day cares, but they seem mostly targeted toward seniors. She's somewhat interested in trying one out, but here's my question. What are the best options for adding structure to a person's day? I'm lucky enough to be able to afford to hire somebody to help around the house with some things, but it doesn't solve the issue of structure. 

A job is out of the question for her right now, even part-time. And trying to maintain a self-structured day has failed (we've tried many approaches for this). We need a system and support, and I'm happy to pay for that if it helps her maintain focus, happiness, balance, and allows her to ultimately work on improving her mental health and get back to doing what she loves, which is painting (she's incredibly talented!)

189,Question For Clinicians - Mandated Partial Hospitalization Programs?,"Hello, my name is Jason and I've been working in Mandated Partial Hospitalization programs for the past 3 years while I chip away at my LPC licensure for Pennsylvania. I'm curious if any of you fellow clinicians have any experience with Partial Hospitalization Programs, particularly mandated ones. Since moving to Philadelphia I've worked in two - one for Substance Abuse + Mental Health (Dual Diagnosis) for persons on Parole and another (current) position working with persons on Megan's Law/Sex Offense conviction + medication +mental health diagnosis. 

I ask because, in both of these locations, the actual ""clinical"" stuff was nonexistent. The Director of the PHP for Substance Dual Diagnosis had a background and degree in Business Administration and ran the program similarly - often speaking of billing and the costs of procedures and offering nothing in the way of clinical supervision or guidance. We had no one with a degree beyond a MS and only one individual with her LPC who was, on paper, our ""Program Coordinator"" but in practice the director of still another program and had no time to meet. We had no meetings regarding clients, none of whom had discharge criteria. 

My current PHP is again overseen by a Director with a background in Criminology and no clinical training. We do not get supervision or clinical supervision of any kind save a weekly meeting wherein we discuss disciplinary concerns (""Steve slept in my group yesterday - discharge?""). We have one psychiatrist on staff, fee-for-service, who comes in three times a week for a few hours and who we as group therapists/clinicians do not have engagement with. We, again, have an LPC-holding ""Program Coordinator"" on paper and absolutely no one in practice, never meeting with her or discussing anything clinical. The turn-over is about 5 months and at 9 months employment I am now the senior clinician. Our clients all have the same vague discharge criteria, ""To work towards incorporating program goals into daily functioning"" and, given that they are Sex Offenders mandated by Parole, not a single individual has graduated successfully from our program in 7 years.  They all ""max-out"" following their Parole term completion - we do not ""step down"" clients to outpatient because, as I have been told in so many subtle ways, the Partial program is highly profitable for our company. 

Is this acceptable? Is this legal? Does anyone else have experience working in purgatory for a non-clinical Director who cannot see how ""but they are sex offenders"" is not sufficient justification for 6 years of 5 daily groups, Monday through Friday, every week?",1473541665.0,False,2,3,HiCommaJoel,None,52568j,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/52568j/question_for_clinicians_mandated_partial/

192,On the edge of involuntary commitment,"Tw: suicidal thoughts and ideations

Background, I’m in Pennsylvania, USA. Diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety disorder, PTSD and OCD tendencies. 

So, these last few weeks have been in a crisis, with passive suicidal thoughts, and we have been safety planning and doing all that and I’ve been spoken to about going into the hospital voluntarily multiple times or doing php/iop. So far I’m just out here vibing with my depression but now it’s turned a bit more active so of course therapy last night was a train wreck and I almost got 302’d. 

My therapist, wife and I did come up with a safety plan for the night, and she did tell me I almost got 302’d which is literally the last thing I want. My whole care team want me to go in voluntarily but honestly I’m scared and don’t know what to expect. I took off work today with my last sick day of the year, and my therapist set me a goal of calling HR to find out if I can get disability so I can get more intensive care for my mental health. She is going to be calling me tonight so we can discuss what I found out and safety plan for tonight, then tomorrow I meet with my psychiatrist, so I’m still not out of the woods of getting 302’d. 

If I go into a psych ward is rather go on my own but I’m terrified. I guess what I’m asking is - what’s it like? How long did you stay? Did it help? What do I even take with me? What happens after?

194,"Advice on ""The Center a place of hope"" or ""PCH Treatment center"" for wife with Depression/Anxiety/BPD","My wife has suffered with depression for years. Shes been on a variety of meds, and is under the care of a psychatrist and RN/Therapist. For the past 6 months its been really bad, and her dr and therapist suggested strongly that she go inpatient/PHP for a while. They suggested this place ""The Center, a place of hope"" in Washington state. My wife did not like the idea of being gone that long (30 day) or far, So she instead went to the local hospital, which was a nightmare experience for a week. She got zero therapy, and they ""adjusted"" her meds right back to where she was 6 months ago (plus one new med). All the while being locked in with the real badly mentally ill. 

She now wants to try this other place out. I've looked into a number of these types of places.

- The center, a place of hope, near seattle Wa
- Sierra Tucscon, in AZ
- PCH Treatment center in Venice, CA
- Clearview Womens Center, Venice CA
- Timberline Knolls, Chicaco

And a few others. 

Insurance coverage would be nice, but it looks like most any of these that are decent will be out of my pocket regardless. 

Right now, we are just about set to go for ""The center"". But after talking to PCH on the phone, it's cheaper (still out of pocket) but seems just as good. 

Looking for opinions, experiences, and even additional suggestions.

195,I feel like there's been something off with my personality for years.,"Hi, all. I am about to confess some things about myself that I have never told another person before.  
I am 23F. I am an elementary school teacher, I am in a relationship and overall live a very happy life. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and bipolar disorder type 2 because of my unstable mood, obsessive thoughts and constant fear. But for years I have felt like it's something deeper than that.  
I have never had a hard time MAKING friends, but I have always had a difficult time KEEPING friends. At first, people usually perceive me as very outgoing, smart, bubbly, funny, and generous. People who have ended friendships with me have told me that I am self-centered, I act like the world revolves around me, I am annoying, extremely argumentative, and needy. The longest friendship I have maintained is over 10 years, but even that friend and I have had some bumps in the road and this person has expressed similar opinions about me.  
If I am describing my positive traits, I would say that I am talented, witty, creative, great with kids and animals (I LOVE taking care of animals and children),  
My INTENTION is never to hurt, offend, or lose someone because of things that I say. However, I do have a VERY short fuse and can get offended easily-- I am quite sensitive. I can be very sexually provocative and promiscuous-- I am in a relationship now, but even currently I still find myself being flirtatious towards other men and women (not that I would act on it but the thought of being desired is really appealing to me). I tend to look for arguments when something does not go my way and I can be very, very verbally (and sometimes, even physically-- shoving and pushing at MOST) aggressive during arguments. I tend to threaten things, such as breaking up and blocking people to get my way, although I have never and will never threaten to kill or hurt someone.  
The worst thing about me that I have not been able to get under control is my compulsive lying. Sometimes I find myself lying about very serious things to get attention, status, or sympathy. For example, I have lied about things that friends have said or done to me to make myself look like a victim in a situation that I caused. The worst thing I have ever lied about is being r\*ped. I was SA'd, but I over-exaggerated the story to make it sound worse than it was in order to get sympathy from people. I feel so guilty about the lying, I KNOW that it is a serious problem, and an absolutely awful thing to do to people, but in the moment I am so out of control of what I'm saying.  
I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder type 2 when I was 20, and again when I was 22 during a PHP/IOP program, because I had exhibited episodes of both mania and depression ( STRONG EMPHASIS on the depressive episodes). I have attempted once, but have threatened to do so many more. With the (hypo)mania, though, I don't think my episodes were really MANIC episodes. Sure, I have felt strong grandiosity, had periods of neglectful sleeping and eating patterns, high productivity, etc., but they didn't last WEEKS or MONTHS like typical mania does. I for sure have anxiety, specifically social anxiety disorder. My current therapist things I have OCD. I have moments where I love myself, and moments where I LOATHE myself-- I will tell myself I am worthless, better off gone, incompetent, fat and ugly, and useless. I take Lamictal and Zoloft, which have been helping with my mood and anxiety, but this weirdness with my personality hasn't seemed to go away or been helped.  
Now, not that anyone here is a psychiatrist/psychologist (unless you are, hi!), so I am not expecting an accurate diagnosis, or even a diagnosis at all, based off of this post. I am trying to see if anyone here has ever experienced, done, or felt anything similar to what I have mentioned here, and what that means for you. I have never confessed these feelings to a therapist, a friend, a family member, a partner-- I know that I should, but it honestly feels so embarrassing to admit all of this and face reality of what I really do and feel. I really feel like there is something wrong with my personality and I want to face it head on and get the help I need.",1704043742.0,False,1,0,Additional_Career874,None,18vckn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/18vckn8/i_feel_like_theres_been_something_off_with_my/

197,Any tips for comparing depression treatment apps using cognitive behavioural therapy?,"I found [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0057447) that shows some promising results:

""Meta-analyses of RCTs of iCBT for depression have demonstrated moderate effect sizes that provide evidence that iCBT can be comparable to best-practice face-to-face CBT"".

&#x200B;

It's 7 years since the study was done so I was wondering if there's much advice that's up-to-date and easy for laypeople to sort through the options.

&#x200B;

Here's what I found on the blogosphere:

* [The Best Depression Apps of 2019](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/top-iphone-android-apps)
* [The top 10 mental health apps](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320557.php)
* [5 Tips For Comparing Depression Apps](https://blog.uplift.app/5-tips-for-starting-a-depression-app-today)

&#x200B;

Those articles and some App Store searching led me to this list of ones that seem like they might(?) provide comparable results to those mentioned in the study:

* Depression CBT by Excel At Life (looked out of date, couldn't find a website or iPhone version)
* Happify
* Moodnotes
* Moodpath
* Sanvello (formerly Pacifica)
* This Way Up
* UpLift
* Wysa

&#x200B;

I'm about to turn in for the night, has anyone had experience with these? Have any better suggestions for how to decide before committing the time (and in some cases money)?

198,Am I a sociopath?,"I don't know where to begin with this so I'll get to it. Recently I've been a bit more introspective since I've just moved on from depression and this isn't really, I believe, a side effect of that ordeal since I've been like this since my adolescence. That is being very, idk, emotionally inept I guess is the best way I can put it.

For example, I get no pleasure whatsoever from saying ""I love you"", ""Hello"" or ""Hi"", ""Goodbye"", ""See ya later"", and just basically any form of greeting you can think of, I don't care for it, I think it's needlessly a waste of breath. I see someone I know walk past me or towards me or somethin, screw saying ""Hi"", I'm just gonna walk. I'm also a poor listener; I drift off easily when it comes to conversations. When it comes to emotionally charged moments (break-ups, mental health, etc.) though, I'm all in for that because those are people I care about. When it comes to strangers or disasters or terrorist events, to me, I know those are bad situations, I know that people are suffering and that it is real, then all of a sudden I start to become apathetic to the situation and I don't know why.

My mind is racing right now typing this, so sorry for the inconsistency of this or my wording or whatever.

200,Guys...husband is ill again,"This is not totally mental health related (I mean it kind of is, and I will explain why) but I need some reassurance and some love right now.

If you guys remember, about 2 months ago or so, I had posted that my husband had to go for an endoscopy and a colonoscopy at the same time (they really Roto Rooter'd him--got him from both ends) and they had found polyps and had removed them. He had been fine for a while until about a week or so ago when he started having severe pain in the lower abdomen. It was so bad that he hasn't eaten (barely) in a week. He has slept all day every day, and that is it. I have been super-anxious this whole time because it isn't easy to see your husband of 28 years hurting so badly. I have felt helpless because there wasn't a thing I could do. Finally I had convinced him to get an appt with his Primary Doctor, which was today. 

Here is where the mental health comes in. I had to go to my PHP all day so he had left way after I had gone to my Program. I hadn't heard a thing all day, and that means I have had anxiety off the charts. I was at Program so I'd had so much support and help to get through it. So I was okay for the day, even tho the not knowing was killing me inside. 

Fast forward to the ride home in the van (transportation)...I get a call from my husband. He went to the Dr. and they sent him to the ER. He is there now and he was pretty doped up when he called (couldn't understand some of what he was saying), so I called the hospital myself and they let me know that he was triaged and they were in the process of determining if they are going to admit him or not. They * think * it is his appendix. When I heard that, it was a huge weight off my shoulders. That is a common operation and they didn't sound like he was in any immediate danger. He'd had diverticulitis years ago and had to have part of his colon removed, so that is what we were worried about initially.

So, to finish this (so it isn't too long) he is okay as far as I know at this time and the hospital will call in a few hours to update me. I am so relieved and my anxiety has gone way down. I am now happily munching on McDonald's fries (there is just myself and the 3 boys here since the 15 year old is with her sister in NY for 2 weeks) and relaxing. Can you just send some prayers up for him? Myself and the boys are fine, but he needs some prayers to get thru this.

202,Finding a provider sucks,"Looking for treatment providers really sucks. Over the summer I moved about 50 miles away for a new job... I became eligible for their insurance in September. It is cheaper with a lower deductible than anything I’ve had before but it seems like they accomplished that by participating in a more limited network. The center and psychiatrist I’ve been using since 2013 isn’t in network. In fact, it doesn’t seem like ANY eating disorder treatment centers are in-network... I just need an outpatient psychiatrist for depression/med management atm but it sucks to know I’d have to fight for options if things get worse and I need a higher level of care. (I have out of network benefits I think but the difference in coverage % could be huge if you consider that a single day of a day program/PHP can run upwards of $800 depending on where you go.)

There are so many results when I search my insurance website but that doesn’t show me specialties or ratings so then I have to google it all too, and so many seem to be primarily for kids/adolescents for some reason. Great for them I guess but just more to weed out. It’s exhausting and disheartening and I’m not even to the stage of calling anyone. Cuz that’s a whole other issue, figuring out if your personalities fit.

203,Looking for Advice,"TW: Suicide 

This is kinda a rant and question at the same time. 

Background: I (17f) have BPD, GAD, depression, used to have IED (but maybe a sign of really early BPD), maybe PTSD, and many other issues. I have been in therapy since I was 5 and I have been to a myriad of treatment programs ranging from PHP to wilderness/out-of-state RTC and therapeutic boarding schools. 

So I (17f) really wanna get better. Like, I don’t want to feel this way. I’ve been suicidal since October 9 every day, as well as most of my life. But this is the longest day-to-day thing. Whenever I have nothing to do and just sit, my thoughts immediately go to suicide. I’ve also been in therapy for years but not currently. I’ve never really had a therapist who doesn’t directly violate my trust and do anything to actually help me. And I’ve seen probably upwards of 40 in my 17 years. That seems like a low number when I think about it. For a recent example, I specifically told my therapist that I didn’t want her to directly go against my wishes and do what she wants because she’s an adult and obviously knows best. Nope! While reading over the text conversation, it was bad. And I’m just afraid of the trust thing, as well as being honest. Like, all I wanna do is hurt/kill myself. But if I tell anyone, mental hospital I go. Again. And if I go to a specific one, I’ll probably go to their rtc unit for a minimum of 6 months. I have a little over 8 until I turn 18. And school. I am taking college classes and classes that I enjoy. If I go to an rtc, nope. And a lot of you might say that the classes are hurting my mental health because of their level of them. To counter that, I’ve never had a problem academically. I like to be challenged. Recently (yesterday and today) I self-harmed a lot. Superficial cuts on my forearm and thigh, but still. And my forensics teacher, who is the only adult I kinda trust, realized that I was purposefully getting 0% on the tests. She wanted me to talk to her about it, and I told her a little about what was happening. She told me that she would feel horrible if I went home this weekend (this was 2 days ago on Friday) and hurt myself and I’m afraid that she will check in on me and I’ll be outed and go to the mental hospital. And my mom is very judgy about this kind of stuff and I can’t tell her anything because she’s so judgy and likes to guilt trip me. But she’ll never admit it. Lastly, some of you might be like, your 17. You can’t be diagnosed. Well, at the hospital at the beginning of September, I was formally diagnosed. I’ve been saying it since I was 14. But nobody believed me because I am a kid. Story of my life. And if I look back on my childhood, from what I remember and can piece together, I’m pretty sure I would’ve checked at least 5 out of the 9 boxes from age 10. Maybe 8. And I know that the possibility of having BPD is low at that age, but there is a possibility.",1667172129.0,False,1,2,Changed0512,None,yhtmmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/yhtmmh/looking_for_advice/

205,i quit the partial hospitalization program and now i feel guilty.,"so i've been going to the partial hospitalization program ( PHP) in staten island and i struggle with bpd and bipolar disorder. everyone there seemed to be standoffish and i felt like i was treated differently from  the other new comers. i figured its because im much younger than they are and they didnt want to bother with me but that makes me feel unwelcome. besides all we did was sit in a huge group and talk about child custody and divorce and other adult topics that im way to young to even think about. we would do this for 4 hours a day it was pretty boring and annoying and i hated everyone for ignoring me all the time like i wasnt there so i quit. but my therapist and psychiatrist wanted me to commit to the program. so yeah i only gave it 3 days (longest 3 days of my life) but it was the same crap over and over again. im just scared that my therapist and psychiayrist dont know what to do with me anymore. i feel a little bad for not wanting to give the program a longer chance but i decided in my mind that everyone there is a cliquey old person who hates me and that the program is crap. i dont feel like i have enough insight on the situation though. i told the therapist at the program yesterday that i would commit but then the same day i told her ""i hate this program and everyone in it"" why am i so fickle? anyways i just wanted to vent about this.

206,Mental hospital,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I’m a 23 y/o F and I’ve struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for almost as long as I can remember. Recently I’ve started to see a psychiatrist and go to therapy but I feel like these things have just brought up everything I’ve kept down all these years and it’s overwhelming. I am miserable, I feel unstable, and I feel like I’m not getting the help I need. If I feel like this a day longer I feel like I’m going to lose my mind. The only option I feel like I have left is to go to the hospital, but I’m terrified. Everyone says it’s horrible but won’t say why. My girlfriend had been when she was a minor but it’s different for minors. I feel like the only thing I’m even living for is my dog and I don’t want to leave him and I’m worried my girlfriend will break up with me. I don’t even know how long I’d be there. I’m so scared I don’t know what to do. Is it really as bad as people say?

207,First flashback has me shook,"It’s been about three years since my mental health took a significant turn and put me through serious treatment. The signs were always there that my mental health was shit through childhood, but 2017 I battled with multiple suicide attempts, an eating disorder, and really got a diagnosis. I was hospitalized multiple times, did a long term ED inpatient/residential stay and spent months in a PHP/IOP program. In the end I got a handle on my BPD and PTSD from childhood trauma and have been putting the skills I learned in treatment to good use. Since then, I’ve been stable. Like, really stable. No medication changes. No real need to see a therapist on the regular. Aside from meds at night, things felt normal. I was managing all my symptoms and really happy with how my life was doing.

Until the other night. I think I had my first real “flashback.” My husband was amazingly supportive through it, but it’s left me shaken. It’s a new one for me. It’s thrown off my confidence in my mental health. It’s sent my anxiety into overdrive cuz now I worry I could have another and because it’s new for me, I only know what triggered the one, but not what could trigger another.

I dunno, I felt like I needed to get it off my chest to help with my anxiety. My family seems to freak out if I so much as share mental health awareness posts on social media, so I didn’t wanna talk about suddenly having a flashback with them and I don’t have a lot of friends I really share in mental health struggles with. I’m trying to decide what I want to do moving forward. Like if I should seek out a therapist again (I’ve moved since my last visit) or if I should just carry on like I was and hope it doesn’t happen again.",1590468608.0,False,3,0,huckleberrydoll,None,gqqj3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/gqqj3n/first_flashback_has_me_shook/
208,Seeking strong sleep aid.,"I wake up in the middle of the night almost every night around 2AM, and again at like 5-6AM and I’m sick of it. It takes me forever to fall asleep and get tired. It takes a heavy pharmaceutical substance to knock me out and the ones I’ve been on before don’t work anymore. Thorazine was what I used before and it used to work really well for a while, even though it’s for schizophrenia, and severe manic episodes. I thought 300mg was a pretty high dose, and for normal people it is, but I guess it’s safe to take up to 1000mg but that’s for people who are hospitalized and under supervision. 
I have a medication hyposensitivity and it takes higher doses to help me with anything. Thorazine not typically used for sleep. I just need something to knock me out, man. My brain won’t shut off. I ruminate a lot and toss and turn for hours. 

Trazodone doesn’t work anymore and higher doses can cause serotonin syndrome, which I had recently and it was awful. 
I’m not willing to try over the counter sleep aids because of the weird side effects, and antihistamines don’t work on me either so Benadryl, and Atarax don’t do shit. Not even for panic attacks. 

Melatonin is weak and extended use can damage the body’s natural ability to produce it even at normal levels. Wish doctors would prescribe a strong medication with the end of the name being “-epam” but that’s hard to get and can be damaging long term since it’s a controlled substance. But I feel like I’m in need of something like that. 

Things like ambient noise, white noise, waves crashing at shore, thunderstorm sounds and music help slightly but not well enough. 
I sleep to thunderstorms and rain sounds. 
I find it hard to sleep without. 
Sometimes I listen to Ghibli music if my brain needs something to focus on until I can get tired enough to sleep. 

Exercise may help but I’m usually in too much pain (fibromyalgia) or too depressed to be active. 

I don’t feel tired but I’m tired of this. 
I need a normal sleep schedule for when I start classes. 

I have a psychiatrist office I’m going to work with on this, and have new patient paperwork to fill out before my first appointment but I don’t know if they’ll jerk me around and only do monthly appointments when I need weekly/biweekly until I’m more stable, instead of once a month. 
I wanted to find an IOP/PHP program but there are limited outreach opportunities in Alabama. I can’t find one. I frequently have suicidal thoughts and am not as stable as I’d like to be. Especially with sleep and sleep is so important for people with illnesses that I have. I can get really sick if I don’t sleep enough. 

So main question: what’s a strong sleep aid or other sleep-inducing medication I can ask to try?",1653902501.0,False,1,2,_Aurilave,None,v0wa8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/v0wa8b/seeking_strong_sleep_aid/
209,I think I have Selective Mutism,"Sorry for the long read

I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder like a month ago and now I'm starting to think I have selective mutism. I started realising that I stop talking in front of people I don't really know, ever since 6th grade I have been reluctant to talk with people in my classes and I don't ever want to participate in group discussions or anything like that, I usually don't talk in school and I remember that when I started grade 8 everyday in the beginning of the school day I would feel super anxious to the point where I thought that if the teacher called on me I would not be able to talk, I could feel that if I were to try to talk nothing would come out, and that happens now too, I dropped out of public school because it was too stressful (I think one of the main reasons was social anxiety, tho my doctor's said it was mainly sensory issues, but I think it was a mix) so I don't have much to compare that too but a few days ago I had to go to my aunts birthday party where I pretty much knew nobody, I sometimes said words like ""hi"" or ""thanks"" but I'd try to only use gestures instead, I'd try to stick with my parents so they could talk instead of me having to, there were times where I wanted to say something but nothing came out and I tried to hide for most of the time, I was able to make full sentences later on once I knew everybody a bit more, bit I stilled tried to talk a little amount. I looked SM up a bit online because I already knew about it and thought about whether I had it before (but on a lesser degree) and I read an article and I fit every symptom it said, like all of them, I did one or two quizzes also because I have zero attention span for multiple articles and the first one said I might have it and the second one said I was at high risk of having it. Here are the links I could find (I couldn't find all of the same websites) [SM article](https://www.selectivemutism.org/do-i-have-selective-mutism/). http://www.ietherapy.com/selective-mutism/self-test/selective-mutism-self-test.php
I talked to some people on discord and they all said to reach out to my therapist or go to the doctor again but I no longer have a therapist and my mom barely let me get my first doctors appointment (for GAD) so idk if she will let me do it again. Also, how do you know if I just have social anxiety and not SM? Could this just be social anxiety or...?

210,Blackout in a virtual-MH IOP,"I (42F) am finally ""dealing"" with my mental health problems.  I was suicidal and hallucinating about 6 weeks ago.  Spent 2 weeks inpatient, 3 weeks in PHP, and this was my second week in IOP.  Everything has been helpful and I'm  doing great.  Monday was a very productive day.  

This past Tuesday, I was seated at a table, using my laptop to participate in a ""virtual IOP"".  I was writing some notes and suddenly, my field of vision telescoped into a small point of light.  I started to fall forward and thankfully came back awake before my head even hit the table.

The IOP therapist called me an hour later when the group session had ended.  I told her that I have had this happen many times, I've already been tested and all my physicians know about it.  

On Thursday, an hour before the next IOP group was scheduled to start, she called me again.  This time, she told me I need to have my medications reviewed before continuing the program.  I immediately messaged my doctors, asking if they thought it might be a medication issue. 

It's not.  I've already been tested for everything.  The last time I had this same blackout experience was in the days and weeks before my hallucinations.

I'm not sure if I should I try to continue this process, or take a break.  Whether or not I continue IOP, I also have my weekly CBT therapist to help me.  And... I'm also on the waitlist for EMDR.

I live alone and I'm retired.  My fear is that I will ""lose my head"" again and may end up hurting myself.  Not sure which is the greater risk:

1)  Continue IOP online, hoping that the therapist will call me if I blackout again.

2)  Quitting IOP and just follow my treatment in weekly CBT.

212,"I am a male with Borderline Personality Disorder, Ask me Any/every thing","I:d like this to be something of an AMA but the general r/ama tends to lose it, so here goes.  For more info about Borderline Personality Disorder (hereafter referenced by me as BPD) I'd suggest checking wikipedia's fairly helpful and informative page on the subject (including our difficulties with therapy):  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder



As for me: 

I was diagnosed under DSM IV-TR.  I know DSM V has different criteria but I don:t know the specifics.   Here are the DSM IV-TR conditions by which I was diagnosed: http://www.spectrumbpd.com.au/pages/about-borderline-personality-disorder-bpd/formal-diagnostic-criteria-for-bpd.php  

""spectrumbpd.com"" lists the 9 DSM IV-TR criteria by which to define BPD when I was diagnosed.  Of said 9 (of which you needed at least five to qualify), I was identified (5 years ago) with 1,2,3,4,6,7,8.  I do have clear symptoms of 9 but the diagnosing councellor said it was ""dissociative disorder not otherwise specified"" and while I think it was a 9 on BPD I would never ever try to directly contradict a professional uncountered by another professional.  

As an incidental measure I arguably meet #5 as well for fantasizing about how bad people would feel if I killed myself/threatening to do it to a few close friends,  but never once was it backed by any sincerity, for all my flaws I love life and being alive (the alternative seems so boring) and even if I wanted to kill myself I sincerely doubt I ever could (and I don:t want to).  Still, 1/10 B-D afflicted can be expected to take/end their own lives, so we're worth your concern.  BPD are 1/100th of the population (maybe), so 1/1000th will die to BPD alone.  That's a lot.

But, if I get to the point where, like any responsible adult with mental health issues, I feel I need to commit myself, what is that process?

215,My friend needs help.,"My friend sent me this message to post on here, so here goes. This is her message, and I will be relaying comments and advice to her because she doesn’t have an account. She’s trying to find an answer to her feelings, and I hope she finds one on here.

To Reddit,

I can't go to a therapist, doctor or tell my parents. I know there is something wrong with me but I don't know what it is, so I'm just going to rant here and see if someone can give me an answer. Please let me know if I need to add more information. I had to go to a therapist, my parents often told me that my problems were stupid and I didn't need a therapist. They would always try to deny my therapist claims about me having depression etc. They yelled at me a lot too when I had suicidal thoughts and stuff. I don't think it's necessary to add the stuff in between this time and when I had an eating disorder. But my therapist told my parents that we needed to see a different professional because she wasn't trained to deal with patients in that field. My parents were a little more scared at this because I was sort of successfully avoiding food and loosing weight until they found out. 

Once my parents found out about my eating u first appointment itself they were pushing my parents to join me in group therapy (IOP). My parents eventually agreed and sent me there. I ate my food the first time but the next time I saw a kid not eat their food so I didn't eat mine. (Also, I was always insecure about my body but I started to starve myself when i heard that my friend was sort of doing it, and my doctor repeatedly made my feel scared of my weight even though I was always at a healthy weight, my family is also big on losing weight). This pushed my ED (eating disorder) therapist and dietician to convince my parents to move me to php. i was frustrated at this point because everything was happening too fast and we weren't working on why I wanted to starve myself in therapy, she just tricked me into giving more information on what I was doing to keep doing my ED. 

I blocked myself out and completely starved myself. My parents didn't know what to do and my therapist and dietician told them that i had to go to the hospital. My parents instead sent me to a residential house for ED. The kids there were sweet but I saw and heard a lot of things there. There was a kid with a big bandage on her arm and she told me she self harmed with blades and when she scratched the wounds there was a lot of blood. I was raised in a house where this behavior was unheard of. I was horrified. i heard stories of suicide attempts, ed behaviors like purging etc that I didn't do. There was a lot of screaming there too and (this part is hard to explain) their behaviors made me realize that my problems were truly not as bad and i wanted to be able to say what they said in terms of the horrible things they went through. (Some of the counselors would make faces to each other as the children cried).

 I only starved myself and barely lost weight but these people self harmed and attempted suicide. I felt out of control-kind of like a chained animal being poked with sticks-. I couldn't bare hearing these things so i started to self harm. The therapist was trash, all we did was her threatening me with higher care if I basically didn't stop feeling suicidal, nobody helped me fix the way i felt and gave me good coping skills, they just put me in an environment where i could not engage in the behaviors that made me feel sane (I am not exaggerating when i say sane) I just followed what people did and was very competitive (I know this is sick). My parents realized this place wasn't helping so despite being warned that i was a danger, they took me out. My parents put me back in the old place before residential (I was thinking that my problems weren't big enough to deserve happiness and to
 deserve happiness i needed to get even worse). 

My ED therapist kept telling me (i was in php) that i was a danger to myself, they made me sign these papers saying I wouldn't self harm (i had to sign papers saying i wouldn't self harm or attempt suicide) : im lucky to have a loving family and live a good life, so i feel ashamed for feeling like this. I also try to hope for bad things like me getting raped so I can say that i have been through enough and can be happy. I also hate therapists because some have told me to my face that I wasn't bad enough and others have made me feel like I am hopeless, worthless, a danger, and insane. I also hate when they trick you into giving out information and confront you on what your hiding instead of helping you solve the problem. Can someone please tell me what this is (and there is absolutely no way i will go to a therapist).

216,I cannot breathe when I eat. What should I do?,"I cannot breathe when I eat. I am afraid that I will choke on food if I do. I was unable to find any advice on the internet about this particular eating disorder, nor have I ever found anyone with a similar problem. 

I have done my research and found a phobia called **pseudodysphagia.** A short [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudodysphagia#:~:text=Psychology,undercapacity%20of%20the%20esophageal%20opening) about it states the following:

> **Severe pseudodysphagia** is the [irrational fear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobia) of [swallowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing) and minor pseudodysphagia is the fear of choking. The symptoms are [psychosomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosomatic). The act of swallowing becomes mentally linked with choking or with undercapacity of the [esophageal opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Esophageal_opening&action=edit&redlink=1). This can induce [panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic) reactions before or during the act of swallowing. The sensation of difficult swallowing feels authentic to the affected individual, although it is based on nothing in reality. It is important that [dysphagia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia) (difficult or painful swallowing) be ruled out before a diagnosis of pseudodysphagia is made. 

However, I am not afraid of swallowing food. I am, however, afraid of choking on food and dying. This fear has become an everyday part of my life and it really scares me. What scares me the most is that one day I may actually choke on food because of this irrational fear, and the fact that I cannot breathe when I eat.

Additionally, I would like to say that my nose automatically stops breathing whenever I put food in my mouth. I do not know why. I cannot control my breathing when I eat. Therefore, I am having to hold my breath whenever I eat something, and I eat *very slowly*. At some point, my body just forces me to take a deep breath when there is not enough oxygen. I am afraid that exactly that may cause me to choke on food one day, and, perhaps, die.

I need serious help. I hope that some of you may give me an advice on how to deal with this phobia and how to cure it.",1602939518.0,False,1,1,throawayaccount1547,None,jcuofs,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/jcuofs/i_cannot_breathe_when_i_eat_what_should_i_do/
217,People Think I may have Psychopathy / ASPD.,"Greetings, First Time Posting in this place.


Many People - both online and offline - call me a psychopath. These people can range from people I don't know who observe me at school, to my peers, of whom three have said that I need to seek psychiatric help.


I have taken the [Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale](http://personality-testing.info/tests/LSRP.php) test, although not in a formal, professional setting - so it's validity can be questioned.


The statements that define my life are as such: 


[*]""For me, what's right is whatever I can get away with.""


[*]""I find myself in the same kinds of trouble, time after time."" 


[*]""Most of my problems are due to the fact that other people just don't understand me.""

The results were: **You score for primary psychopathy was higher than 85.7% of people who have taken this test. 

You score for secondary psychopathy was higher than 74.89% of people who have taken this test. **


Why do people think I need help? They think that I need it because of my loose morals (I don't think that killing, or abusing animals or the dead is wrong. Same with necrophilia, torture, and other acts seemingly 'amoral');


However, I cannot be a psychopath as I struggle to deceive or manipulate, due to my autism.

I made up, in my mind, on Saturday that I was going to end my life- I've been thinking about it for some time and finally decided I was going to start the process of getting my ""affairs"" in order. I planned on making it to the end of September so I could get through my kids birthday and that was it.

I ended up telling my husband this was my plans- he came to the conclusion I was suicidal because I was talking about a lot of things with a sense of finality. And through hours of conversation I promised him I would go through the ""system"" one more time to seek treatment.
I have struggled with depression and suicidal attempts since my teenage years. In December of 2014 I was diagnosed with major depression and subsequently treated. I have since been diagnosed with Bipolar type 2, anxiety, OCD and I feel I have PTSD. I was receiving treatment and stopped in March of 2018- I felt the medicine was making me highly impulsive and I made some major bad decisions around that time.

Since then I have been handling myself through sheer willpower- to keep things in check. My husband and I have both found I've been easier to deal with and things have been okay.
Until recently. I am constantly plagued by suicidal thoughts, but now I find myself more inclined to want to act on them. Nothing in particular happened to trigger a depressive episode- I have just become extremely tired with my life and the process of living. I also suffer from HS, type 2 diabetes, chronic pain and migraines. My quality of life is miserable. I'm constantly battling with my mind and physical body to get to the end of the day.

I actually got to a point of peace when I decided I would end my life. But now I'm struggling. I know the process of seeking treatment will be long, and I fear I don't have the ability to make it through. I have reached out to family and those friends who are close- we're military- and have received words of encouragement and support, but when asking for physical help- come and be with me- I've received nothing.
I've reached out to a key spouse to see if there's any support the military can offer and got nowhere.

I don't want to be hospitalized again, it makes things harder for me. But I'm at my wits end, we live paycheck to paycheck, we're on one income with 2 kids. I can't afford to just pay someone for childcare, I can't even afford to get junk food and binge. I literally need the good will of people to understand how terrible of a place I'm in and help me and my family in a very real way. My husband goes back to work tomorrow and I have no idea what the day will bring.

219,I've been diagnosed with Autism and Bipolar,"The peculiar thing about me is that I'm very skeptical of everything and everyone, at least now I am. But after being discharged from a psychiatric facility for the 6th time and now participating in a PHP program at my local hospital (6 hours a day, moved down to 3.5 hours now for a week) and seeing that I am completely inept when it comes to sparking up a conversation, along with my deep misinterpretations of society and how to function in this world.

I was locked away my whole childhood, and teenage years. I mean, I went to school but I was only a ghost. I'm only able to get this all out because I don't have the poignant stares of ""intellectuals"", ""psychologists"" in front of me. I can't look at you in the eyes, I never could, I understand I should but I won't. No connections will form because of this and I'll isolate more and more, only accelerating my inability to create relationships.  I was labeled as stupid in some aspects of my functioning, but as a genius in other aspects (math). I didn't understand why? And without that why, I became very one-dimensional throughout my childhood. I'm 21 now, and I'm trying to turn my reality around but it's like I'm a child learning to walk for the first time, blinded by my misfortunes and the idiocy of my parents and the world (when it comes to understanding autism).

Or maybe I'm just so far gone that I've only deluded myself into believing that I've had an epiphany. When what matters is the resulting behavior from having this epiphany. The result of this epiphany is nothing but an understanding, an understanding that you can't fix this. I'm disgusted by the way I behave around people, I still want connection (I, in fact, yearn for it) but to no avail, because I'll only be stuck in this constant embodiment of disconnection.

220,"My older daughter is ruining our family, and I can't deal with it anymore.","I am married with a wife and two daughters, H and A. We are a Christian family, and, apart from some marital issues between me and the wife, are in a good situation. A few years ago, we moved for the first time in our girls' lifetimes to be closer to my job, and while A is thriving, H has just completely lost it. 

&#x200B;

It started when we found out she was cutting in early January of 2017. We scheduled an appointment with a counselor to deal with this issue, but at her very first appointment she revealed that she was actively suicidal and got referred to a nearby psychiatric hospital, where she spent 5 days inpatient and then stepped down to a PHP. We were determined to get through this issue so we could get on with our lives. She was a freshman in high school. 

&#x200B;

That was when the first instance of manipulation happened. We got called in to the hospital shortly before she was to be discharged, where she informed us that she 'needed to go back to inpatient' so she could 'work through what she'd learned.' The wife and I were both against it, as we could both see right through it, but the staff were on her side and she got readmitted to inpatient for another 5 days. When she was finally discharged, she went on Homebound (basically doing public school from home) as she was close to 2 months behind. It was a struggle to get her to do her work, and the only reason she was able to pass was that her teachers cut her work load down to about a quarter of what the rest of her class was doing. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to December 2017. H had been doing okay, average grades in school, had a bit of an attitude and was rather lazy around the house but we chalked it up to teenage angst. Anyway, one night, my wife got mad at H after a hard day because H had been wearing her shoes without permission. H completely lost it and started verbally attacking her little sister. Once that finally died down, H had stomped off and the wife was trying to console A, when H just appeared and started cussing out her mother. Screaming, profanity, flipping her off, the whole 9 yards. At this point my wife has had enough and leaves to go for a drive, which she often does when she needs to calm down. H locks herself in her room again, and I'm left to deal with poor A, who was finally calming down when H was back and running out of the kitchen with a big steak knife saying that she was going to kill herself. In my attempts to physically restrain her, she managed to slice the artery in her wrist, so poor A had to call 911 while I was trying to deal with that. Police and EMS arrive and take her away in an ambulance, but A and I have to stay behind to file a report. When I finally make it to the hospital, staff informs me that H has consented to be admitted inpatient again, but the nearest psych ward with a bed is over 3 hours away. Okay, fine, she needs help. She gets transferred there overnight while I go home and make arrangements with my work, hotels, etc. Spend a week down there with her, and she's discharged and back home with some med changes. The whole affair has strained our family relationships and everything is rocky at home.

&#x200B;

This time, she doesn't make it three months out of the hospital. February 2018 she leaves a suicide note in her class basically saying 'fuck you all, I'm going to kill myself' and leaves the school building unnoticed. She is found 4 hours later by a member of a search party with no damage except for a few topical cuts she managed to inflict with her broken glasses lens. The person who found her calls 911 and alerts them of her location as they're chasing her through the stream. Police eventually catch up with them, and when H realizes she can't outrun them goes under water and refuses to come up until she is pulled out by officers. She was handcuffed and taken to the hospital, where the wife, A and I meet her. Surprise surprise, another hospital admission. This time she is 8 days inpatient, during which time she tried to convince the staff to send her to residential because we were being 'just horrible' to her. However, by the time she steps down to PHP she has changed her tune and says she is 'ready to get better.' She had a good couple of months and managed to pull her grades up enough to pass her sophomore year, made some friends, and set some life and career goals.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the present, H is 16 and is already flunking her junior year even though she's hardly a month in. She's constantly picking on A to the point where it's negatively affecting A's mental health. She is lazy, refuses to do any chores around the house, and gives me and my wife a severe attitude. She's converted to atheism and refuses to do anything religious. She has once again completely isolated herself socially, but still complains constantly about not having friends. She listens to obscene music, wears more revealing clothing, is fluent in curse words, and is experimenting with her prescription medications. She has gotten into a cycle of binge eating and restricting calories, but has been leaning heavily towards the binge eating side an has ballooned up to 220 pounds at 5'5"". She associates with unsavory people, one of whom she is dating. Last week she went on a school field trip, and when one of her classmates had an allergic reaction and had to go to the hospital, all she would say was that the student was an 'attention seeking bitch' and that she 'ruined her trip.' She has managed to spend over $200 of my money behind my back in under a week despite knowing that we're currently struggling financially. She is once again refusing to do her schoolwork. She writes in her journal about how she's 'done looking for attention' and is going to 'kill herself for real this time,' calls herself a disgusting cunt, and, perhaps most alarmingly, talks about how sometimes she wants to kill someone just to see what it's like. 

&#x200B;

It's not hard to see that she's miserable. But her attitude and her actions are tearing our family apart. My wife's already poor mental health has hit rock bottom, and she's told H that if she gets admitted to the hospital again, she's not coming back. A is also feeling the strain, as she's always stressing about H and feels the need to always be there to babysit H as she is the only one who H still has some semblance of a relationship with. I've never felt so worthless, so hopeless, and I'm done. I can't deal with H anymore. I want to wash my hands of her and focus on mending what's left of our broken family. And just thinking that makes me feel like a horrible man and father, but it's the truth.

221,Wondering/Going insane over whether my life is a (coma) dream,"I was asking on r/answers if someone could make me comfortable about this issue knowing that I'll never have a concrete answer. One person said I could be having early signs of psychosis. He said this:
Please talk to a therapist about this. I'm no doctor, but especially if you're 16-25, it sounds like you're describing the kind of delusional symptoms preceding a psychotic break: Odd beliefs or magical thinking (e.g., Feeling confused about whether a dream actually happened; Wondering whether other people might be able to read your mind; Finding meaningful connections between unrelated events; Clear and frequent déjà vu experiences or experiences of unreality) http://www.cedarclinic.org/index.php/understanding-early-psychosis/early-signs-of-psychosis
The Finding meaningful connections between unrelated events part sounds like me. I'm not in the age range he mentioned though. Ever since I started thinking about it (2 months ago) I've noticed more of me hearing my name being called out of nowhere. It's not as bad as when I first started thinking about it. That's when I was CONSTANTLY thinking about it. It started getting less constant over time though. Also during that time I was doing dumb things trying to wake myself up like staring at a wall while closing my eyes in a dark room. I don't do that anymore obviously but yeah.... Here's a link to the post I made on r/answers (This post was a repost of another post of mine and that original post was made late at night and also I needed to just let my mind spill.

222,Resources for finding a place for my psychotic bipolar brother to live,"Hi r/mentalhealth,

First, I hope this is the right sub to be posting in for help with resources. If not, can somebody point me to the proper sub for that? Anyway I’d appreciated some advice/resources to sort out my brothers living situation... 

Diagnosis/Substance Abuse:

A few years ago, my brother (21) was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with a psychotic component. I personally think his symptoms more closely align with schizoaffective disorder (https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizoaffective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20354504), but our dad has bipolar disorder which might have influenced the doctor’s diagnosis. I’m not a doctor though, so this is the only official diagnosis he’s got. 

He also struggles with substance abuse issues. Mostly Xanax as far as I know, but he was a heavy pot smoker in high school and got into cocaine in high school as well.

He’s seen multiple psychiatrists over the years, but basically refuses to continue seeing them if they don’t prescribe him benzos.

He also went to a PHP program for several days but refused to continue. 

Living Situation:

My brother currently lives with my mom. My sister and I have been out of the house for a few years now. My dad lives with his girlfriend about 30 min away from my mom’s house.

In March of this year, he and my mom got in a fight and he pushed her out of the house and pulled a knife on her. My mom called my dad who called the police. They came and arrested my brother, who had been in jail for the past few months, but was released in the middle of August. 

This last incident (along with previous anger issues) made it clear that he and my mom should not be living together anymore.

Question:

My sister has been looking into finding places for him to stay. She’s looked at local NAMI support groups, buying a trailer and renting a lot in a trailer park, Section 8 housing, Mental Health America’s housing webpage, SAMHSA’s housing webpage, Healthy Place’s housing webpage, and the Public Housing Agency’s website.

Does anybody know of any other resources that we might be missing? He gets just over $900/month in disability benefits. The rest of us can afford to pitch in around $100/month for whatever we can find. We live in Pasco/Hillsborough County, Florida.

223,"I think I get depression regularly, but I don't know if it matters?","Today I read an article about Abraham Lincoln which listed the common symptoms of depression, and explained that anything can set off a period of depression, it doesn't have to be a major event.

https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4976127

I feel all of the symptoms listed pretty regularly, and have done since some time in secondary school. I'm 26 now.

I regularly feel worthless, stupid, struggle to do things, think about killing myself or wish I was dead quite frequently. I go through periods where I don't eat much, or can't remember anything, and avoid doing anything new or uncertain. I went through a phase of self harming when I was 24 - 25 so I could sleep at night, and have a few scars on my arms and legs.

I used to work in a hospital, and a patient died which upset me a bit. I got 8 sessions with a clinical psychologist, but after two sessions she said there was need to see her, because she could only offer CBT, and she believed I already thought that way?

I have a good job and I'm happily married to a woman who lets me be alone for hours when I feel rubbish, even if I feel that way for a long time. These days I can usually push through my lethargy and indecision, especially at work, although I find it harder to do at home.

So far I've just assumed I'm a pessimistic and gloomy person. I know about things like emotional regulation and central coherence, and assumed I was just born bad at them, like some people are bad at maths.

I'm not convinced there is any benefit in seeing a doctor, and I don't want to be a burden since I am clearly functional.

If I am getting depressed regularly, how would I stop it? Is there any clear benefit to stopping it since I've managed to put up with it for so long?",1554671341.0,False,1,0,Designer_Lingonberry,None,bal5ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/bal5ti/i_think_i_get_depression_regularly_but_i_dont/
224,It gets better :),"Hi everyone, 
For over a year now I have been in treatment, ranging from residential treatment where I lived in a treatment center for 93 days, to inpatient stays at the hospital, to php, and iop. A year ago I had just been diagnosed with depression and now I am diagnosed with bipolar, severe depression and anxiety, and anorexia. On top of that I struggle a lot with addiction which is 50% of why I’ve been to residential. I also struggle with self harm pretty bad, I’ve cut burned scratched, anything I could do feel pain. I thought my life was never going to get better, I couldn’t stay sober no matter how hard I tried I gave up everything and It still wasn’t enough. As my use and self harm got more and more severe I reached a point where I woke up in the hospital because I had overdosed and was told I was going to treatment. After treatment I relapsed on cocaine ketamine Xanax and I self harmed worse than I had ever before. My anorexia took control of me and I could go 4-5 days without eating until my iop made me or else I would get sent back to rehab. I reached my rock bottom. The longest I had been sober was less than 2 weeks and same with self harm. But when u r at rock bottom you can only go up and I am happy to say i have gained 2 pounds I am over 2 months sober and almost 40 days self harm free. To anyone reading this who is in a horrible place I know that life feels like it’s not worth living and it’s never going to get better but please don’t give up. Keep fighting and reach out for the help u need!! Nobody should fight the monsters in their head alone and I want to make it clear that ALL OF YOU ARE WORTH IT! I

226,"My brother has asked for help, but I don't know where to start.","Hey guys, I don't know if this is the place to ask this, but maybe it is or someone can direct me to a better place.

I think my brother has been dealing with mental illness for probably most of his life, but we have never really acknowledged it or tried hard to do anything about it. 

It was only by forging a strong relationship with someone that has severe mental illness, but works really hard to deal with it, that I was able to understand that my brother might also have mental health issues. 

I recently talked to him about this, and asked him if wanted to get help. He has said yes, and that he is feeling at an all time low. But I don't think he's the type to actively research this type of thing. I told him that I would help him, and help get the help he needed.

I don't really know what he has, but I suspect it is some form of depression and ADHD. What I'm really looking for is a therapist (I think) that can help us figure out the right path.

Some background info:
1. He doesn't have insurance
2. But my father and I could help pay for therapy/treaments
3. He lives in Queens, New York

By Googling and searching this subreddit, I have come across these two websites:

My questions are basically:
1. Am I on the right track, or am I missing a more basic step?
2. Are these sites reputable?
3. Do you guys have any tips or personal insights?
4. Any other things that I might not be thinking of but should consider?
