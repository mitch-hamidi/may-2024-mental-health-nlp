It is helpful to have some help working through the concepts. You can find videos on line that introduce you to some of the key concepts and skills. However, if available near you and affordable for you, try a group therapy or class on DBT skills. Perhaps an IOP program that is part time or has other offerings is an option. I also recommend seeing a therapist that uses DBT in treatment. I went to a DBT therapist through a university hospital and we solely focused on skill building and I got so much more out of it.",Gerianne19321932,1c0byzw

1,"I'm glad to hear that you are looking into Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT); it can be an incredibly beneficial form of therapy for individuals with depression, anxiety and intense emotions. I understand your struggles with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) being less successful than you anticipated in overcoming depression and anxiety. 

The focus of DBT is on learning how to accept difficult thoughts, feelings, and situations as well as developing skills to manage those feelings better. That is precisely why DBT could be the perfect fit for someone who has a tendency to become overwhelmed by their own thoughts or emotions like yourself. It would definitely help train your brain in understanding yourself better and putting less emphasis on introspection which tends to lead us down destructive paths at times. 

If you do decide to pursue this type of therapy I encourage you to find a therapist who specializes in DBT if possible; it may help you get the most out of each session by working regularly with someone skilled specifically in its practice. If that isn't available however there still could be considerable benefits found within using Cognitive Behavioral Therapies combined with self-awareness training through meditation or mindfulness practices such as yoga - even trying them out briefly can teach us invaluable lessons about ourselves!",talkaden,zlb60n
2,"I'm inclined to think that you could benefit from DBT, and I would definitely talk about this with a qualified professional.  
  
The reason I say this is because DBT can help with anxiety and because you describe yourself as extremely introverted.  
  
If I understand correctly, you have a problem with avoidance, and this is at the heart of DBT.

1,"Artist, as you likely know, BPD is a spectrum disorder that we all have to some degree. It is a pattern of primitive ego defenses we all use. They become a problem only when our BPD symptoms become so strong and persistent that they undermine our ability to sustain very close LTRs with other adults.

The human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions and motivations. Significantly, this is true for ALL adults.

This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool down. We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are experiencing intense feelings.

Well, a pwBPD is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently because he lacks the emotional skills needed to regulate his own emotions. This means that a pwBPD experiences very intense feelings far more frequently than other people.

If you suffer from BPD, you likely experienced a trauma in early childhood (from inherited genes and/or your environment) that prevented you from acquiring certain emotional skills. Most cities offer excellent treatment programs (e.g., DBT) that can teach you the emotional skills needed to regulate your own emotions. They can teach you how to do self soothing; how to intellectually challenge intense feelings instead of accepting them as ""facts""; and how to trust others.

They also can teach you how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in the room instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your partner's personality is essentially unchanged day to day); and how to avoid black-white thinking by learning to tolerate strong mixed feelings, uncertainties, ambiguities, and the other gray areas of interpersonal relationships.

Like learning to play a piano, it requires many years of practice to acquire the techniques taught in DBT so they feel so natural that they are readily available when you need them. A good overview of basic DBT techniques is discussed in free online videos at [Now Matters Now](https://www.nowmattersnow.org/).  

By far, the biggest block to success in DBT is that the vast majority of pwBPD lack sufficient self awareness to see they have issues that need to be addressed. I mention this because your high level of self awareness bodes very well in your chances for success -- as long as you remain strongly self motivated to stay in the DBT program long enough to make a real difference in your life. I wish you the very best, Artist!",Up-Town,ho5luk
2,Thank you for your informative kind response. I am in a very healthy loving relationship for the first time in my life and it has really encouraged me to seek help for not only the sake of our relationship but myself. My estranged mother also suffers from BPD and PTSD. I have experienced and seen the abuse first hand and I have a deep deep fear of becoming like her. I believe this is why I’m so self aware. However she is far from it. I want help and to get better more than anything. It’s so hard going through every day. I need to get better? That’s all that matters to me,-StarvingArtist-,ho5luk
0,"Buy the workbook! It's not just about self harm (although one of the major efforts of dbt is to get people out of the danger zones of self harm and suicidality.) It's also great because it works on mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, distress tolerance and emotional regulation. All these are great not only for the existential way we look at our own selves and esteem, but the way we interact with the outside world. Basically dbt tries to ""not make things worse"", to cut the cycle of self fulfilling prophecies and coping strategies that only make things worse.  ",princepolyp,aeimzk
1,"There’s only a handful of dbt books but they’re pretty available online in print and pdf. Look for the dialectical behavioral therapy skills workbook. 
That being said it’s very very important to practice and learn these skills in a group therapy environment or through a trained therapist. Its a lot of social skills, and the book isn’t perfect. By talking and discussing and practicing it helps a lot. 
Also it’s designed to challenge a borderline schema, meaning there’s going to be a lot of concepts and skills that seem stupid or ineffective to her. But trust in the skills, and go beyond the book, and eventually it’ll start working. Works for me!",princepolyp,aeimzk

0,"Dialectical behavior therapy is a form of CBT.  They aren't two separate treatments.

3,"DBT is basically CBT with a more humanistic spin. The therapy still requires a lot of behavioral techniques and cognitive restructuring, but also emphasizes ""dialectics."" The best way to understand dialectics is to think that two apposing things can both be true at the same time, e.g. This can be the worst moment if your life, and you can survive it. Marsha Linehan is very into eastern ideas of balance and mindfulness, which are the basis of the D in DBT.

0,My therapist mentioned it but I didn't ask any follow up questions. What is it?,nothingduploading,7zl1lb
0,"1. Yes, I did DBT for a year.

2. Yes, it helped me a lot.

3. Yes, I completed my DBT sessions in 2015 and the skills have stayed with me and offered a huge amount of help for my continued recovery.

4. To make it more efficient, honestly the big thing is deciding for yourself in your head if you really want to put the effort in. I was really against it at first and got kicked out of a few different therapy programs the first time around — they always said it was because I had such a severe personality disorder that they weren’t capable of helping me. But with this particular one, after I was asked to leave, I spent a year going through a DBT workbook by myself to teach myself to be more open to what they were teaching. Really had to work hard to sort of train myself out of the rigid black and white thinking, at least enough that I was able to take in what they were teaching when they went back. Then they did welcome me back to that group, and I had to put in a lot more hard work to make sure I wasn’t just taking up time fighting with the counsellors instead of admitting that I was uncomfortable. The way it worked for me was, 2 repeats of basic mindfulness practice, then cycle through each section of DBT going through each part twice in total.

5. For me, it wasn’t until my second time going through each section that I actually started to notice I was able to make changes that were helpful to me. That took about 5-7 months of just sticking through, taking the time to listen, and reminding myself that these people were not trying to attack me as a person, that they really were trying to help. By the final 5/6 months, the instructors were commenting on how I had become a grade A student in their course. Not gonna lie, that feeling of validation really kept me going through to the finish even though I didn’t say so at the time.",nilherm,7lokct
1,"For me, despite having borderline (comorbid schizoaffective) I didn't find it extremely useful however it was still pretty useful.

Disclaimer: While it was not for me to the fullest extent I do believe that it is great for most and will still promote it.

I have done DBT 3 times and what I found was that I had already practiced a lot of what was taught. I also grew sick of distracting myself from my problems so a lot of the self soothing techniques became quite redundant for me. Though they did help for a long time. 

One thimg I had a lot of trouble with was recognizing the emotions because it became apparent my emotions don't feel like other people's. For example they describe worry and fear as being in your stomach but for me its above my shoulders (like a feeling that exists outside my body). I am not sure if this is due to having a psychotic disorder though. 

The best advice I can give is don't quit even if it's not working out you need to try and try again before figuring out what works and what doesnt. 

Not everything they teach will apply to you in some cases but nonetheless keep at it.",unusuallyalice,7lokct
2,"Saved my life. Good luck and God speed, ",,7lokct
3,"Thanks for replying!
What helps you not to think so much in black and white?

Even after the training do you still use the skills you learned today?",druggedmonkey,7lokct
4,"Thanks for replying,

How did you found out what worked best for you? And was it a good thing to stop using some techniques even if they did not work that well? Didn't you miss out on some things?",druggedmonkey,7lokct
5,"One part would be asking questions and actually listening to the answer. For example, at first I was confused and uncomfortable because it didn’t seem ‘right’ to me to try and erase all free thinking with constant mindfulness. When I asked for clarification on that, they said it’s not about always being mindful and never letting your thoughts roam. It’s a grey area and it’s about finding balance. That was hard to grasp at first, but then with assessing situations when I found myself confused in the all or nothing thoughts, it slowly got easier to pick out what balance means in different situations. 

Another big part was confronting my attending counsellor to tell her that I had been viewing her in an ‘all bad’ way and hadn’t been able to acknowledge any of her good traits, and apologizing for being so argumentative with her when she was trying to help. Then also saying it would take time for me to learn to see her as a balanced person and there would still be times I’d see her as all bad, but that I was willing to work with her and learn. Ended up being hugely helpful to talk with her about that and we still have really positive appointments to this day.

Yes, I do still use the skills I learned. For me, as I got more into practicing the skills every day (for real, every single day) they slowly became my go-to reactions for difficult situations instead of a conscious effort to correct the harmful reactions.  Now they sort of just keep going all the time, every day, as a subconscious processing style to go through my day. It does take a lot of energy even though it’s not a conscious effort though, and I notice it when I get really sick because then I have to revert back to actively practicing the skills as my body doesn’t have the left over energy to keep it running in the background.

Edit: I would like to add — the biggest improvements that I noticed came long after I finished DBT and happened very slowly, over time, as I continued practicing every day. So the other user’s advice of sticking with it (even if it doesn’t seem to apply to you or really make sense at the time) is pretty important. And for me, through the consistent practice, I was able to find ways or make little changes that made the teachings more helpful for me personally than they were originally.",nilherm,7lokct
6,"I think all of them can be uaed depending on the situation and the person. I wouldn't say I stopped using techniques completely they just are hardly needed for me to function better. Like I'm a person that is up in their head a lot and I don't find grounding myself helps me solve problems but when the problem can't be solved it's beneficial even if only momentarily. Just to give an example.

I am more often than not in wise mind except when it is really bad-- i tend to go between the cold/logical/rayional mind and wise mind a lot. When I slip into emotion mind it is nowhere nearly as bad as it was before (though I've had my days).

Number 1 thing: don't let bad days discourage you either. This therapy will not work 100% of the time lile anything, 'radical' acceptance can be key sometimes. (I hate yhe word radical tbh)

The DBT workbook has been really helpful as a supplement to that, because while therapy addressed my issues and helped me work towards being generally healthier, it didn't really give me practical ways of coping with crises and anxiety when they do arise. My problem is BPD, and when my emotions (especially rejection or anxiety) spike, I can't think and get stuck in an anxiety loop, and this book is great for helping to have a plan ready for when that happens, to help yourself calm down, avoid destructive behaviours, and cope with the intense emotions.

In short: in my opinion, it's excellent for helping you take responsibility for your own well-being and cope with stressful situations, but not for getting to the bottom of what causes your troubles. ",arseoutofthemselves,3fvqsk

sometimes finding a good mediator who you trust can help keep conversations alive and truthful and productive to help with problems. My father for example can be very harsh on me at times and very passive aggressive and can quickly get aggressive. My therapist at one time brought me, my father and mother in and he simply just let us talk and try to fix an issue and if someone said something out of term or disrespectful, he would correct them and continue the conversations. it also helps with interrupting and stuff like that.

However I would also recommend you talk to someone individually whom would be a good mentor to figure out the self regulation and improvement part. the first step to improvement is recognizing your own faults so props to you for good self examination. now you just need to figure out how to counter it",Trainer_Jo3y,18qpmun

0,"Attraction generally means attaching your own happiness to the presence of another person. This has different reasons, be it a desire for a sexual relationship (the evolutionary reason for being attracted), be it to alleviate one's own loneliness, be it ""not to be that guy without a girlfriend"", whatever. Being easily attracted means having a large desire and an urge to soothe that desire (because desire is only sweet on the surface, and hurtful beneath). Certainly since she has a similar background to you that breeds familiarity, which is very comfortable (humans prefer to be with those that are similar to them, since they are more predictable and thus safe to be around).

You have two options at this point, not mutually exclusive:

1. Examine where the desire comes from to be with that girl. It's obviously absolutely normal to want to have a girlfriend, but it's good to know whether your desire comes from attraction or if it's just to not be lonely, or other reasons. Learning more about your desire can help you learning more if a closer relationship with this girl is what you actually want (and also if you are actually a good fit).
2. If you are attracted to this girl, why not pursue a relationship? I wish you all the best if you go for it! Be prepared though that if she rejects that the pain you feel will be proportional to how much you have attached your happiness to being with her, or in simpler terms: how open you are to the possible situation of not having a relationship with her. So it's best to stay open to this result, as far as it's doable of course. Also you should think about how to handle such a situation, considering you will continue to be in the same class.",Fluffcat23,17gvakm
1,"Man I really appreciate your comment. The problem is I don’t see myself being with her or something like that, I don’t know if that’s yet to come or what but I am unsure if that’s what I want to happen and I really enjoy talking or hanging out, I just think that my brain goes to overdrive when thinking about her and when we’ll next meet",hervashu,17gvakm
2,"As I mentioned desire is actually often a painful state (some might prefer the word ""bittersweet"") and that is probably what is bothering you at the moment. If you want it to become less bothersome you need to reduce your mental attachment to this girl (this does not mean you have to stop being with her!). That would mean you need to learn to take notice when this desire is present in your mind and then mindfully choose whether you want to act upon it or not. If not, you just let it be (mental states often just go if we don't fight or actively try to ignore them). This is essentially what you learn with breathing meditation or other mindfulness exercises. You can find many explanations on this subject on the internet, for example on [https://www.mindful.org/how-to-meditate/](https://www.mindful.org/how-to-meditate/). The only thing I'd like to add is that often meditation is simplified as a relaxation technique, which can be a bit off the point. From my understanding meditation is (among further purposes) about training concentration (ability to stay focused) and mindfulness (ability to notice), so that you may notice when you're mind is currently trying to fulfill a craving/attachment, and then let go of this craving/attachment (which doesn't mean one has to give up pursuing what they initially did with attachment). This is what leads to relaxation. 

Training mindfulness will take a bit off time though, but a few minutes every day go a long way.

So by being mindful you would be able to be with this girl, enjoy her presence and talking with her, and you would be aware whether you want to take it further or not and act accordingly while staying open to the results of your actions. So you would be suffering less.",Fluffcat23,17gvakm

1,"I personally have Did myself alongside ptsd, generalised anxiety, major depressive disorder and conversion disorder and I can confirm it does affect cognitive abilities.

I didn't know this until I'd developed FND which is a conversion disorder as an inability to cope with mental emotions. It caused physical symptoms such as dissociative seizures, temporary paralysis, weakness in the body etc. It also affected my speech, hearing and sight which then affected my ability to basically do anything at all. Cognitive abilities being weakened or changed doesn't happen for everyone with mental illness but with people that have cluster b disorders or dissociative disorders it is wayyy more likely to affect it.

Also to clarify I'm not a psychologist but as someone who developed this sort of problem I'd like to think I have a bit of experience in understanding it as it majorly impacted me for 2 years x

0,Happy to talk later. its sleep time here. Not  talk about dbt but mindfulness and the way we reject and oppose everything .it's our thinking.,nonamenouse2020,12dfbmw
1,"What parts of mindfulness are you struggling with? For me, the idea of meditating made me want to jump out of my skin and scream. Buuuut, grounding exercices really helped in a panic, and stretching was a good way of getting to the present by just being in the moment with my body and mind.",swild89,12dfbmw
2,"First, I want to say that DBT is backed by solid evidence. It was better than the other treatment for BPD in 8 studies (source - book by Roemer and Orsillo).  
  
One way to look at mindfulness is that it's just awareness. Some people make this look like it's more complicated than it really is.  
  
Just being careful in what you do is a kind of mindfulness. The teachers will sometimes tell people to do some common household task like washing and drying the dishes, paying careful attention to the feelings in your hands and the sound of the water. You can look up ""grounding exercises"" and find other things like that.  
  
Maybe if you talk about this with your therapist you can get some good advice about this.  
  
Another thing is that DBT has very useful methods for coping in a moment of crisis, when you think you might hurt yourself. Above all, know those methods. It's very simple things like paced breathing and simple distractions, whatever changes your mood like your favorite music or a funny video.  
  
DBT paced breathing   
  
  
This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.",RWPossum,12dfbmw

5,"Grounding is getting you back to the present here and now moment, works when you’re too in your head or feeling disconnected (like when dissociating or panicking). it can be sometimes as simple as a cold shower/splash of water on the face.

Wise mind is a tough concept, don’t be too hard on yourself with wrapping your head around that one, that’s time and practice with your therapist analyzing tough situations and getting a grasp on how to apply it

There’s also the subreddit r/dbtselfhelp that’s got people also struggling if you’re ever interested:)",swild89,12dfbmw

1,"Crown, BPD is not something -- like chickenpox -- that a person either ""has"" or ""doesn't have."" Instead, it is a spectrum disorder, which means every adult on the planet occasionally exhibits all BPD traits to some degree (usually at a low level if the person is healthy).

At issue, then, is not whether you exhibit BPD traits. Of course you do. We all do. Rather, at issue is whether you exhibit those traits at a strong level (i.e., are on the upper end of the BPD spectrum).

Hence, when your psychiatrist said he saw ""signs of BPD,"" he was not saying he had diagnosed you as having the full-blown disorder. But he apparently had concluded that your BPD traits were sufficiently strong and persistent that you could be helped by attending a DBT work group (which is the most commonly prescribed treatment for BPD).

The key characteristic of BPD is emotional instability. It is due to the lack of emotional skills needed to control one's own emotions -- and also due to the lack of a strong self image.

BPD is believed to be caused by an inherited gene and/or by a childhood trauma (e.g., abuse or abandonment) occurring before age 5. Because the trauma (real or perceived) occurs so early, it interferes with the child's emotional development. The child therefore has no opportunity to develop a strong stable sense of self identity -- and has no opportunity to learn the many emotional skills needed to be able to control her own emotions.

This is why the BPD adult cannot learn those missing emotional skills by swallowing a pill or talking about her childhood. Like learning to play a piano, the pwBPD must work hard for many years in a training program (e.g., DBT) to acquire those missing skills.

Although medication won't make a dent in the BPD itself (or your piano playing skills), nearly all pwBPD are prescribed meds. The reason is that the vast majority of pwBPD also suffer from 2 or 3 co-occurring clinical disorders -- e.g., bipolar, depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD, or ADHD. For example, 74% of pwBPD have a co-occurring anxiety disorder and 75% have a mood disorder such as depression. The medications are targeted to treating those co-occurring disorders. See Table 3 at [2008 Study in J Clin Psych](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2676679/).

Therapists sometimes mistake BPD for bipolar when they haven't seen the patient very many times. Moreover, these two disorders oftentimes occur together. About 30% of bipolar sufferers also have BPD and about 40% of people with BPD (pwBPD) have co-occurring bipolar. See Table 3 at link above. If you're interested, Crown, you may benefit from looking at my description of [12 BPD/Bipolar Differences](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9mj9u8/how_do_bpd_warning_signs_differ_from_those_of/).

6,"Usually don't take part in these sorts of discussions because of how wildly different everyone experiences mental illness and the drugs associated with helping combat it, but. Here we are.

It heavily depends on you, as I mentioned, but different drugs also do different things. Personally, and among friends and family who've tried it? Zoloft helps you feel ""better"" by ensuring you don't wake up to feel bad in the first place. It's an incredible sleep aid, but doesn't feel like it does much else.

Escitalopram, from personal experience, numbs the mind to negativity more than suppressing it. You will, if you stick with it, notice that the bad doesn't feel quite as bad, but it will still persist as a background player to contest with. Frankly, a lot of drugs are like that. I don't know (personally) of any that will make it all go away, or inspire endless happiness. Moreso just an ability to ignore the doom and gloom.

Personally, on Escitalopram, I still have episodes where things get really bad and at times even feel worse, but they're rare and brief, and always (upon reflection) only represent how bad I -used to- feel. It's a very jarring reminder of how far I've come both as a person and with the help of the medication.

You may respond poorly or not at all to some, while responding incredibly well to others. The first step, however, is alwaya to consult your doctor and bring up these thoughts and feelings. They're your first step towards coping, and through them you will hopefully find even more resources than just pills, because in reality? The pills are only a half measure. You need to put in personal effort alongside them, or they will never stick.",DowntownButterfly6,1cqn8re

(and many others.) You could be totally different. 

Tricyclics (TCA’s) (such as Imipramine, Amitriptyline, Clomipramine, Doxepin, Nortriptyline) are an older class that came out before the SSRI’s. They have worked well for me especially on anxiety. I’m currently on Nortriptyline.

0,"Charlie, BPD is a spectrum disorder that we all have to some degree. It is a pattern of primitive ego defenses we all use. They become a problem only when our BPD symptoms become so strong and persistent that they undermine our ability to sustain very close LTRs with other adults.

The human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions and motivations. Significantly, this is true for ALL adults.

This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool down. We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are experiencing intense feelings.

Well, a pwBPD is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently because he lacks the emotional skills needed to regulate his own emotions. This means that a pwBPD experiences very intense feelings far more frequently than other people.

If you suffer from BPD, you likely experienced a trauma in early childhood (from inherited genes and/or your environment) that prevented you from acquiring certain emotional skills. Most major cities offer excellent treatment programs (e.g., DBT, TFP, and CBT) that can teach you the emotional skills needed to regulate your own emotions. 
They can teach you how to do self soothing; how to intellectually challenge intense feelings instead of accepting them as ""facts""; and how to trust others.

They also can teach you how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in the room instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your partner's personality is essentially unchanged day to day); and how to avoid black-white thinking by learning to tolerate strong mixed feelings, uncertainties, ambiguities, and the other gray areas of interpersonal relationships.

Absent those skills, you must continue to heavily rely on the primitive ego defenses that we all rely on during childhood: projection, dissociation, denial, rage, magical thinking, and black-white thinking. 

**I also have depression, severe anxiety, and PTSD.**

A 2008 study of American adults found that the vast majority of people having strong and persistent BPD traits (i.e., pwBPD) have 2 or 3 co-occurring ""clincial disorders."" In the group of female pwBPD, the study found that 81% have a co-occurring anxiety disorder, that 80% also have a mood disorder such as depression, and 47% also have PTSD. See Table 3 at [2008 Study in J of Clin Psych](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2676679/). I hope this is helpful, Charlie.",Up-Town,ftc31q

1,"Did she self diagnose her with misophonia? Because it's actually a new term and psychologists still studying it. I can give an overview of what irritation to a particular noise is like because I have it. I hate slurping and eating sounds and they make me irritated and fearful, not angry and I understand that every one has a different response. And what's with mentioning a particular word? That doesn't fit in to the definition of misophonia.. maybe she needs to talk to a therapist about her problem..",,qphei8
2,"The thing with certain words looks more like a personal preference, I guess, but coughing/yawning/sneezing seems legit.

Also, Kassy's comfort is her responsibility. I don't have misophonia as an official diagnosis but I've always been sensitive to certain sounds (not necessarily slurping/chewing but also stuff like construction noises or certain voice timbres and intonations) and I think this rule-imposing BS is inappropriate, let alone trash talking. You're not supposed to babysit her and you definitely have the right to cut her off for this behavior.",dora_la_destruidora,qphei8
3,"As someone with a mental illness myself (depression, Autism, and ADHD) let me be very clear that although your mental illness may cause you to do bad behaviors like snapping at people or getting paranoid, it is YOUR JOB as the person with the mental illness to take responsibility for your own actions. ALL of your own actions, even the ones caused by mental illness.   


So if you snap at someone because they trigger your misophonia, you have the responsibility to come back and apologize to them soon. A real apology, not just ""well my misophonia was bad.""  


My autism causes me to have sensory issues, and there are some ""bad noises"" that I can't stand being around. But it is MY CHOICE how I handle my response. Instead of snapping at people or demanding they stop the noise, I leave the room for a minute, or put in earplugs, or put on earbuds with some music.   


Misophonia just means there are certain noises you can't stand, it does NOT mean that you automatically have to snap angrily at the people around you. That is a choice, a very careless and immature choice.   


For me, the moment she started posting on social media that I was a bad person, that would be the point I was done. Because if you're such a bad person, why does she even want to hang out with you?   


You can have a disability and still also be a toxic and emotionally abusive person. Sounds like she is crossing that line into being an emotional abuser. You are not under any obligation to hang out with her against your will because you ""cant abandon a disabled friend.""  


It is the job of us with disabilities to figure out how we can live in the world with everyone else. If you can't walk, you don't ask everyone to carry you, no, you get a wheelchair. And if you can't stand certain noises you figure out how you can block out those noises so you can function in daily life. Maybe even see if certain medications or therapy can help. You don't ask everyone around you to totally change their behavior to avoid annoying you.

Some triggers are ridiculous, people can't control what they do or say all the time, mostly when it's basic human behaviour. The first thing you learn in therapy is how to ground or separate yourself from a situation when there's a trigger so neither you or anyone else is upset, and you can live normally. If their misophonia is so bad they're the one who has to be careful and work on it, attacking your friends and then blaming your condition is very toxic.

And yeah I think you have a really good point about people who really play up their (possibly nonexistent) MH issue to use as an excuse for any type of behavior. I see it a lot lately. 

My personal ""unpopular opinion"" take on it is that some people just CANNOT stand not being the center of attention. So they see that the community is finally treating trans people, (for example) with validity and respect, and trying to be kind and gentle to them based on what they have been through - and suddenly they are (for example) nonbinary or genderqueer. And as a bi person who just doesn't do gender, I try to give the benefit of the doubt.

And hey I am really happy that people can finally talk openly about all these identity and MH things and actually get validation and support instead of literally thrown in jail or a MH institution.

It's just... it's now so easy to just say you are depressed or genderfluid, and there are various communities online that will instantly and unquestioningly give you tons of empathy and advice and encouragement.

 I can see where it would be tempting, even addictive, for someone to get envious and self-diagnose to claim the disorder or the identity, and bask in the attention and encouragement. 

Especially because in a lot of online communities where you can find that sort of support (tumblr, reddit) you can have a totally anonymous account and don't have to claim your MH issue where it could actually affect you badly, such as at work. 

When you can be anonymous like that and choose who knows about your self diagnosis, you can have an online identity completely separate from your IRL identity. 

Which means you can have the sympathy and support, the validation and encouragement, without any of the downsides such as losing your job or having your family doubt you and criticize you, or risk losing custody of your kids.

I can see how, when it's that easy and safe, it could be REALLY tempting...

In our current culture I don't think anyone is really getting enough support from their social circles and workplace friends anymore - yay, Corona. So I'm not saying that the people I know don't need support and encouragement. I'm just pretty sure that some of them are faking a disorder or blowing a minor disorder up somewhat out of proportion to get it. 

So maybe I'm the a\*\*hole but I just plain don't believe some of the people I personally know. Call me a cynical and suspicious jerk, I guess. I know people could say ""but what is the harm in just unconditionally believing people and supporting them...?"" a

TBH I could write another long post about how that actually could harm individuals and communities of people who definitely have various MH issues. 

For one thing, people who use a possibly fake MH disorder as an excuse to get away with anything, definitely give the disorder a bad name and make it harder for people who would do anything NOT to have the disorder. But I ramble too much already so let's just not go there :)",BoneclawWalker,qphei8

1,"Hey I just wanted to send some words of encouragement. I did a year and a half of intensive DBT and it changed my life for the better. I was given a sort of unofficial juvenile diagnosis at 15, after being identified as being very at-risk, and did 5 hours of DBT (individual and group) each week. Diagnosis was confirmed when I was 18. At 22 now, I’ve been using DBT skills and mindsets for several more years and all the psychiatrists I’ve seen since have said they can’t technically give me the diagnosis because I no longer qualify! They say it sticks with you forever, but it’s possible to get to a place where the symptoms don’t interfere with your life NEARLY as badly. 

So my advice to you is, take the DBT very seriously. It sounds like BS at first, a lot of it does anyway. But it really truly works if you break down your exact thought and emotion processes and follow the steps they give you to handle different situations. It becomes more natural and automatic to use these skills as time goes on. Think of it like a “how to be a person” class. It’s a matter of relearning reactions/responses, and thought processes. It’s hard, it’s intense, but it seriously works wonders.",mackeyart,qcp8zo

0,in my experience therapists are willing to take your best guess as a starting point and will just get you help. Over time they'll get to know you and make any adjustments to your treatment as necessary. They just need you to show up.

That's why you don't self-diagnose.  Instead, go to a doctor or other person qualified to make a mental health diagnosis, and explain your symptoms to them.  They will make an educated guess (and *hopefully* ask some follow-up questions) based on your symptoms, their experience and opinion, and their reading of the DSM-5.  ",,6762z8

Tbh I'm not sure what actual position the person I see holds, I was just told I was being referred to a mental health specialist and I've been seeing her for about 9 months now so I feel stupid asking. Haven't been formally diagnosed, but my GP had me do a symptom check thing (which I thought was seriously flawed but whatever) and said I was 1 point away from having major depression (I think that's the term they used). They offered anti-depressants but I said I'd rather get specialist help. The specialist has brought up anti-depressants a couple of times but seems kind of on the fence about it, and isn't really bothered when I say I'd rather not.

She actually asked me to keep a little diary of thoughts to take in, I suggested using my phone and she agreed (I worry about people finding the diary). Problem is when I take notes on my phone they're way too brief, so now she has me filling out this self-esteem workbook thing. I basically just had to get over the fear of someone else reading it, and it's so much easier to let her just read whatever spills onto the paper rather than trying to bottle everything up for a month and then be unable to remember it at my next appointment.

I don't want to self-diagnose but tbh I find it extremely hard to recall all my symptoms in my actual appointment so I feel like it might be better to just say ""I read about AvPD"" rather than try to explain all my symptoms that are related to it. That way they can just say it's not that if it isn't, or it is that if it is. I know that if I just try to describe it I'll talk about anxiety over certain things and then forget to mention the whole ""avoiding"" part.

Basically I know I have an avoidant personality, but I would never call it a disorder without expert diagnosis. It's kind of like OCD. I need to have things in the right place or I get upset, but it's a mild upset and they're very easy things to order, so I don't actually have the disorder (which I believe is the medical term for ""fucking with your life"") I just have a compulsion that's slightly obsessive.",merrwan,6762z8

0,"Hi. Meditation has helped me greatly. I try to meditate for at least 15 minutes each day. I just close my eyes and focus on my breathing. It relaxes me and reorients everything. Just sitting with myself and forcing myself to breathe has calmed my nerves. Meditation is especially helpful at the start of each day before I do anything else.

1,"Let me start with I’ve never been officially diagnosed with anything mental health related. My dad (mom is out of the picture) and several school counselors recommend I get checked out but I adamantly refuse to be tested. My main reason is I don’t want to be officially labeled as depressed, even though there is nothing wrong with it I just refuse to be labeled depressed. Also when I’m older I want to do fun stuff like shooting guns with friends and I would feel obliterated if I got background checked and they (logically) refuse to sell to me. Admittedly I was in a dark place and had bad habits such as staying up real late like 5 am and sleeping until 2pm missing my whole day and getting very little sunlight. I was also drinking and smoking everyday which is never a good thing and eating poorly. Some of the biggest tips I used to feel like I can function is 1) have a reasonable sleep schedule. Trust me you will feel so much better if you get your full 8 hours during the night and I don’t feel sluggish when I wake up in the morning versus when I was waking up in the afternoon. 2) eat healthy. I don’t mean kale everyday and green drinks but don’t scour the kitchen at 3 am and eat a bucket of ramen because munchies. Try to eat 3 well made meals everyday and cheat with some chipotle or fast food every once in a while. 3) exercising. It can suck but after a while I started to really enjoy it. I was (and still am) very self conscious, and the gym is a pretty public setting and everyone works at different levels so it’s perfect to play with my conscious. After a while you learn people focus on themselves more than you and almost no one is watching you work out. 4) be social. I used to be friends with over half my school but I am very good at ending relationships and cutting people off. I don’t really have people to hang out with irl but just talking to people on video games and finding communities is such a nice outlet to just talk and be yourself. With corona being social may be more challenging but you can always just talk to your family or caretakers and see how they’re doing. 5) don’t pretend to be someone your not. Form your own self image and identity don’t feel obliged to be the popular girl/boy and force yourself to follow a trend you may not like. It is okay to be yourself. 

Ah the long text wall has come to an end. I don’t know any apps that could help but maybe just setting reminders in your phone to just take a step back and breathe may help. I’m just a dumb 17 y/o so I doubt any of this junk helps but I genuinely hope you feel better and that everything turns out fantastic. Best of luck to you.",6shirts,fki913
2,"Hey there!

Psychotherapy could totally be helpful for you, depending on what's going on. DBT (dialectical behavioural therapy) can be good if you struggle with emotions, relationships, and self-harm thoughts/behaviour. It has four components; building risk tolerance, mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness and emotional regulation. [DBTselfhelp.com](https://DBTselfhelp.com) is a good website to get your started if that jives.

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is good for depression/anxiety and in some cases can be just as good as meds. It's targeted through a thought/mood/behavior pathway and looks at the way your mood interacts with cognitions (for example, are you someone who catastrophes? has negative beliefs about yourself? pessimistic? ruminates on things? + more) and behaviour (maybe you isolate because of it, engage in self--defeating behaviours, ect.). Mind over Mood is a nice ebook (can often get free PDF) to take a look at. Anxiety BC (Canadian resource) also has some neat resources/apps/ect.

Hope these little things are helpful. :) (In addition to stuff below, didn't want to repeat anything).",lazyolturnip,fki913

5,"Wow, thank you so much. I am going to check them all out because I currently have, or have at one point had, every single one of those. I heard great things about CBT/DBT so having actual resources is very helpful. 

Also, what exactly is psychotherapy? Is that talk therapy with a counselor? If so, I currently see one but I asked her to help me with these things (like if we can practice some of the exercises together since I have a hard time doing them alone) but she never really follows through with anything. She is awesome as a person and has helped me quite a bit, but I noticed that the whole time it’s just been me talking and she hasn’t really provided me with any feedback or resources.",ostomyass,fki913
6,"Psychotherapy is called talk therapy, but how it works/indication varies depending on the type. You were right in your initial post when you talked about neurocircuitry in the brain- aberrant pathways between different emotional regulation centres, fear centres and the front part of our brain that deals with complex executive functions can be changed with certain psychotherapies!

The problem is, is that not all therapists have the same training or even inclination to do a certain type of therapy. For example, where I work, nurses, counsellors, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists and other physicians primarily provide therapy- but their experience with different models really changes. Some do family therapy, DBT, CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy, acceptance commitment therapy, motivational interviewing or more psychodynamic/psychoanalytic type therapies. Some people do more ""supportive therapy"", which is a therapy, but is more being supportive for someone. Some are really focused on emotion, are unstructured and have an indefinite length of sessions; whereas others like CBT are highly focused, have homework sessions and stick to a general schedule of under 16-20 sessions.

I suppose the crux of psychotherapy is the person/therapist relationship that provides feedback to the person about what's happening behaviour/thought/mood wise and some degree of challenging beliefs to lead to progress.

I'm not sure if that's helpful or not!",lazyolturnip,fki913

1,"Sure! I think it's basically that rather than trying to encourage control, the therapy encourages relinquishing control. Rather than stopping behaviors, it's largely an allowance of behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and emotions (with the recognition that it's still a good idea to act ""wisely"" and not, say, punch someone in the face just because you feel like it). I guess one could call this opening. It's also about being open to feedback, taking things in, considering, self-inquiry, etc. The contrast with BPD/ DBT is that folks with a BPD diagnosis are noticeable-- they scream, cry, fight, etc-- it's much more dramatic. These are people that can pass because they work their jobs, they are successful because they can complete tasks, yet they're, I guess, not happy/ connected (*cries/ barfs/ runs away/ comes back*). The therapeutic work is doing opening (while staying safe-- in fact my impression is the work is largely to get oneself into a state of feeling safe, then live one's life) and it's intended for closed or closed-off people-- those that have been isolating, etc. Hope that made sense, let me know.",RODBTmod,5bnm69

[You might find some help here.](https://emotionsmatterbpd.org/)",88_si_cay,17awz8n
1,"Sorbet, your GF's abusive behaviors cannot be excused -- but perhaps can be explained, especially if you would speak to a psychologist in your city. Those behaviors may be due to her having very weak control over her own emotions (i.e., a lack of emotional skills she had no chance to learn in childhood). My exW has that problem. If it is an issue for your GF, you likely would be seeing 4 other red flags.  
  
*The first* is a strong abandonment fear. I therefore ask whether, a few months into your relationship, she started showing strong jealousy over harmless events involving other women -- or tried to isolate you away from your close friends and family members? She would view your spending time with friends/family as your choosing them over her. Moreover, she usually would hate being alone by herself.  
  
*Second*, you would be seeing her rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein she tends to categorize some people as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"") and will recategorize them -- in just a few seconds -- from one polar extreme to the other based on a minor infraction.  
  
Because she also uses B-W thinking in judging HERSELF, she would rarely acknowledge making a mistake or having a flaw. Doing so would imply, in her mind, she is ""all bad."" She thus would blame nearly all misfortunes/mistakes on you and view herself as ""The Victim.""  
  
Further, to ""validate"" her victim status, she would keep a detailed mental list of every infraction/mistake you ever did (real or imagined) and would not hesitate to pull out the entire list to defend herself in the most insignificant disagreement with you. Moreover, this B-W thinking also would be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER....""  
  
*Third*, you generally would not see her directing her anger at casual friends, coworkers, or total strangers. She usually gets along fine with them. Rather, her outbursts and temper tantrums almost exclusively would be directed against a close loved one (e.g., against you, a sibling, or her parents).  
  
*Fourth*, you are convinced that she truly loves you. But you frequently see her flipping, on a dime, between Jekyll (loving you) and Hyde (devaluing or hating you) -- often making you feel like you're walking on eggshells around her. Such flips would occur in a few seconds in response to some minor thing you say or do. A few hours or days later, she can flip back just as quickly. 

Sorbet, have you been seeing strong occurrences of all 4 of these red flags?",Up-Town,17awz8n
2,"Wow. Yeah you described it perfectly. Seems like if I make one mistake i’ve never did anything right. I definitely have been talking to family a lot less often since meeting her. What should I do? She IS a really sweet girl, and I strongly think could make a good wife, but these outbursts are tough to deal with.",Sorbet_pOKE,17awz8n
3,"**I’m deeply in love with her.** 

Sorbet, if your GF is a pwBPD (person with BPD), she likely loves you too. A pwBPD usually is capable of loving you very intensely -- but it is the very immature type of love you see in young children. This means she will occasionally flip -- in only seconds -- from Jekyll (adoring you) to Hyde (devaluing or hating you). And a few hours or days later, she can flip back again just as quickly. These rapid flips arise from a primitive defense called ""black-white thinking.""  
  
Like a young child, a pwBPD never had an opportunity to learn the emotional skills needed to handle two strong conflicting feelings (e.g., love and hate) at the same time. This means she has great difficulty tolerating ambiguities, uncertainties, and the other gray areas of close interpersonal relationships. She thus will subconsciously split off the conflicting feeling, putting it far out of reach of her conscious mind.  
  
With young children, this ""splitting"" is evident when the child will adore Daddy while he's bringing out the toys but, in only a few seconds, will flip to hating Daddy when he takes one toy away. Importantly, this behavior does not mean that the child has stopped loving Daddy. Rather, it means that her conscious mind is temporarily out of touch with those loving feelings.  
  
Similarly, a pwBPD will categorize everyone close to her as ""all good"" (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me""). And she will recategorize someone from one polar extreme to the other -- in just seconds -- based solely on a minor comment or action. This B-W thinking also will be evident in her frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions such as ""You NEVER..."" and ""You ALWAYS....""

**I’m willing to jump hurdles to help her with this mental disorder... What can I do to help her?**

Sorbet, you cannot help her with her disorder. That is something she must do for herself, under the guidance of a professional. BPD is believed to be caused by an inherited gene and/or by a childhood trauma (e.g., abuse or abandonment) occurring before age 5. 

Because the trauma occurs so early, it blocks the child's emotional development at age 3 or 4. The child therefore has no opportunity to develop a strong stable sense of self identity -- and no opportunity to learn the many emotional skills needed to control her own emotions.

This is why a pwBPD cannot learn those missing emotional skills by swallowing a pill or talking about her childhood. Like a person learning to play a piano, she must work hard for many years in a weekly training program (e.g., DBT) to acquire those missing skills.

**I’m not very good at being an emotional support.**

If you are in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, Sorbet, whatever you do will be hurtful to her much of the time. A comment or action that pleases her on one day may greatly offend her when repeated a week later. Moreover, she often will perceive you as being hurtful when you DO something and hurtful when you DON'T do it. In this way, you often are damned if you do and damned if you don't.  
  
This conundrum is due to the position of her two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear at the other end of that same spectrum.  
  
Your predicament is that the solution to calming her abandonment fear (drawing close and being intimate) is the very action that triggers her engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming her engulfment fear (moving back away to give her breathing space) is the very action that triggers her abandonment fear.  
  
Consequently, as you move close to comfort her and assure her of your love, you eventually will start triggering her engulfment fear, making her feel like she's being suffocated and controlled by you. A pwBPD usually craves intimacy like nearly all other adults -- but she cannot tolerate it for very long.  
  
Because she has a weak sense of self-identity, she easily becomes very enmeshed in your strong personality during sustained periods of closeness and intimacy. This is why her sense of personal boundaries is so weak that she has difficulty seeing where HER feelings and problems stop and YOURS begin. Yet, as you back away to give her breathing space, you often will find that you've started triggering her abandonment fear.  
  
In my 15 years of experience with my BPD exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution (between ""too close"" and ""too far away"") where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns how to better regulate her own emotions and tame her two fears, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwBPD typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push-you-away and pull-you-back.  
  
Indeed, even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a word, a pwBPD who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto you. Her subconscious does this to protect her fragile ego from seeing too much of reality -- and to externalize the pain, getting it outside her body.  
  
Because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level, she will consciously be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from you. This is why an untreated pwBPD usually BELIEVES the false accusations coming out of her mouth (at the moment she is saying them).  
  
Hence, as long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated pwBPD, you often will find yourself hurting her -- i.e., triggering her engulfment fear as you draw near, triggering her abandonment fear as you draw back, and triggering her anger even when you are sitting still and saying absolutely nothing.

**What should I do?**

I suggest that you see a psychologist -- for a visit or two all by yourself -- to obtain a candid professional opinion on what you're dealing with. Whenever strong BPD warning signs are appearing, it is important to see your own psychologist, i.e., one who has not treated or seen your GF.  
  
In that way, Sorbet, you're ensured that the psychologist is ethically bound to protect YOUR best interests, not hers. I mention this because therapists generally are loath to tell a high-functioning pwBPD the name of her disorder. They often decide that it is not in her best interests to be told.

I also suggest that, while you're waiting for an appointment with the psychologist, you take a look at the r/BPDlovedones sub, where you will find hundreds of members sharing their experiences of living with -- or walking away from -- their BPD partners. 

In the right-hand column of that sub, you also will find a list of good books and links pointing to online resources. If you ever decide to walk away, I recommend you read the online article, ""[Surviving a Breakup with Someone Suffering with BPD](http://bpdfamily.com/bpdresources/nk_a109.htm)."" If you have any questions, Sorbet, I will be glad to discuss them with you.",Up-Town,17awz8n

DBT is great for BPD and for symptoms needing emotional regulation but it might be better to start with something more general.  You could have an eval done at a DBT center and ask if you're a good fit or if something else might be better. They'd be able to refer you to someone else if need be. You could also go to the DBT center if your mom insists, but get a second opinion from the counselor on campus (honestly, I'd start with the therapist on campus but that's just me). It's your treatment. You deserve to get the help you want. Hope it goes well!

Also depends where you live. If you're in the US, you can see any therapist and get an evaluation done. If you're in the UK, you'll likely need a referral.",givemeanew_name,955goj
1,"Get your usual doctor to recommend a psychiatrist. 

Make an appointment for an evaluation and take it from there diagnosis wise.

You're lucky to have the resources of a psychological center and you may be able to go there for your evaluation and treatment and they'll probably have a lot of options for treatment. DBT is very good but there's a chance it's not the match for you or its not enough on its own. Hopefully the clinic is reputable and ethical and would tell you if they thought DBT was wrong for you. ",Susccmmp,955goj
2,"The best option is probably going to be calling your normal doctor and getting a referral. Here are the reasons why:

1. DBT is helpful for regulating moods/anxiety, so even if you don’t have a trauma history or a personality disorder you can still benefit from that treatment model. BUT a more generalized approach might be more useful at this point since you don’t really know what specific issues you’re dealing with.


2. The counseling available through universities is usually subpar.  Often, you’re talking to a grad student and are only offered one year of counseling before they refer you somewhere outside of the school. I’ve had more misses than hits with that shit.

3. I would not trust a regular doctor for an accurate diagnosis (or medication honestly). Sometimes diagnosis is complex, especially with co-morbid issues. Ex: if you have trouble regulating emotions, a normal doctor probably won’t be able to tell whether it’s bipolar II, a response to anxiety, or ADHD shit. All of those are medicated differently and getting prescribed the wrong thing can be a very bad time. A psychiatrist can usually differentiate better than a normal doctor can.

Hope some of that helps!",y2kcasualty,955goj

2,"I don't think you should hate yourself for having a disorder, as long as you are trying to learn about it or get help for it which it sounds like you are.

It also sounds like you could be suicidal, in which case this post might help: [How to Deal With Suicidal Feelings](https://www.reddit.com/r/MindOverMatterScott/comments/cfej01/how_to_deal_with_suicidal_feelings/)",Sbeast,y07hsn
3,"You're not a bad person. How are you a bad person for having something out of your control? You have a condition that you didn't ask for and don't want, that is highly stigmatised by people who don't know shit about personality disorders or mental health in general.

It's incredibly tough to not internalise all the ableism about bpd, and I think you need to get in touch with services or organisations that specifically support people with bpd. You can ask your therapist to find them for you, and if you can, tell her that she's not helping, you feel she isn't taking you or your worries seriously, that you feel she's being dismissive, and it's making you feel like you don't deserve to live, which is the opposite of what she's supposed to be doing to help you.

If it's possible, you can ask her to find you a different therapist, or an extra one who specialises in treating people with personality disorders, because it sounds as if she's not hearing you, and just telling you that you're overthinking things isn't at all helpful to you.

There are lots of people with bpd who are online. There's probably a bpd subreddit here, and there are groups on Instagram, twitter, Facebook, and there are dedicated mental health websites that will have their own forums where you can find other people to talk to and get support.

Reddit in general is hella ableist. People on this site are ignorant and will label any behaviour that doesn'tfor their very narrow definition of ""normal"" as 'personality disorder', without having the slightest bit of knowledge about what a personality disorder actually is.

All their ignorance, hatred and stigmatising of personality disorders says more about them than it says about you. There will always be people who hear 'personality disorder' and instantly think that everyone with the condition is a cardboard cutout from a horror film, but they're not the people you should be dwelling on, and their shitty, uninformed opinions are not the ones to kill yourself over. 

It sounds like you might need to do a bit of research into your condition, and find and speak to other people with bpd, to help empower you, because at the moment you're paying attention to the wrong people and feeling bad about yourself as a result.

You've internalised their ableism and are now using their erroneous judgements to punish yourself. It's not right and it's not fair. You know yourself best, and you don't have to feel beholden to these nameless, faceless know-nothings to the point you don't want to live anymore. Fuck those people. You don't have to care what they think.",Fearless-Golf-8496,y07hsn
4,"Hey there, I also have BPD and I understand how you feel. There have been countless times where I felt like I acted horribly and to be fair, some of that was certainly true. But another part of it was just my flawed perception of reality. As you know, people with BPD tend to feel things more strongly so while we might do something that hurts others sometimes we might perceive it as a bigger issue than it actually is. 

On top of us, in some cases, like in mine, some people tend to hand manic like episodes and it is especially in those time that I become truly unhinged.

In particular there was an incident that lasted 4 days and happened a year and a half ago which I have trouble talking about because of how messed up it was. However, every time I have the courage to talk about it, I can assure you that people do not perceive me as a monster despite how horrible and stupid I feel like my actions have been. Instead, they support me and try understand me as best as they can. They do not blame me but instead understand that, at that time, I wasn't really me.

Because that is the truth, BPD ISN'T you, it does not reflect your true personality but rather is a disturbance of it. At s certain point you have to recognise that it is not YOU committing those actions but your disorder bringing you to do them. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try not to do those things and try to control it but rather that you shouldn't blame yourself but instead be kind and understanding just like other people are.

Only once you start being kind to yourself can you truly start to get on top of your disorder, trust me. I still get very dark thoughts and still think of ways to get my way which would be, at least, hurtful to the people around me but I've become self aware to the point that I can realise that is not the way I should deal with my feelings and I try to control them. I'm still under the criteria for BPD but at least I'm not hurting anyone anymore. It is still hard on myself internally, but just know you can get better, it takes time and love",DullIntroduction7621,y07hsn

3,"More so commenting to affirm what has helped me. Whatever you end up doing OP, I hope you have a path to a similar or better recovery I did.

I have BPD and I'm (mostly) recovered. I'd say about... 90% recovered? And that occurred in about a year, from diagnosis to my current level of disorder management. This isn't to say that I'm emotionally stable all the time, but I can effectively and healthily communicate when it's starting to happen and ask for the support which stops a split from happening. Lack of identity and emotional impermanence are still issues, but I'm actually quite emotionally regulated these days. Save for my first violent split in over a year that went down last night and I'm still not completely out of it. I just feel well controlled to be by myself, but I'm not bright eyed and happy like I usually am 95% of the time.

Reflecting back on when I was really, really out of control and splitting extremely badly on a weekly or twice weekly basis at least, my recovery was only possible because I was ready for therapy. Dismissing it and discrediting it would've made me resentful of my therapist and then there was no way they could help me. Not their fault. Mine. Because I wasn't truly listening to what they were telling me.

I also had to swallow that hard pill that I *was* feeling the wrong way. I was in the wrong. I was being unhealthy to myself and the people around me. It sucked, trust me, I know. But you know, self-acceptance is actually really helpful. I still laugh and openly say that I'm a psycho, I'm a nutcase. It's true. But that doesn't mean I'm a bad person. I often feel like a walking, talking disorder but I understand myself on such a deep level that I know when it's manifesting itself in destructive ways and I can ask for the love and support I need to defuse it. And it works.

And you know what really stuck with me after I left therapy? Developing the maturity to apologize for my behavior and reach out and help heal the people I hurt. I'm inherently incredibly selfish and needy with my BPD but sometimes I have to say you know what, push my needs aside and tend to the needs of my partner. Recognizing that it's not all about me and, if need be, going through our happy times to remember I love this guy even if my emotional impermanence is making it very hard to feel that like I usually do. I also have to accept when I said I hated him, I meant it. But that's something I only feel when my BPD episode turns hurt to anger. Because anger makes me feel better and I'm vindictive when I lose control and I want to hurt him as hurt as I feel but my anger masks.

I think it's good to recognize that while your feelings in episodes are valid, they're still wrong. And you have to actively strive to communicate them in healthy ways. So last night, I lost my shit and messaged my partner ""I really, really hate you."" And I meant it. I didn't regret it. But after a few minutes, I messaged ""I recognize that my lashing out at you is abusive. I understand and accept the potential consequences of my behavior. I sincerely feel like I don't have a partner and I understand that's largely my fault for not having the self-control to avoid this episode.""

See, just because you lose control of your feelings doesn't absolve you of the personality responsibility to take ownership of your actions and make amends as best as you can. You have to have the self-awareness that you were wrong, you couldn't control it, and then have the selflessness to put someone else first and make sure *they're* okay before they can help you.

95% of the time, we're a happy, healthy couple. Like, really. Still in the honeymoon phase after several years. Fights only ever occur when I split which is now a once a year or so thing. Communication and self-awareness and maturity to recognize when I'm being a piece of shit to someone is really healthy. As well as knowing I'm insane and laughing about it positively with my partner that he knows. Acceptance for being a psycho is really healing. Once you accept yourself, you start finding yourself more and more able to manage the disorder until it rarely manifests itself in destructive ways at all.",Feather-Light,b1ufh4
4,"As far as I'm aware DBT is the only therapy designed and approved for BPD. Before DBT individuals with BPD were treated with the other common talk therapies and these were found to have really minimal success rates. 

I do agree that not even ""normal"" people accept everything in life and that your therapist should validate your feelings (depressed and anxious thoughts get validated and then corrected, so why can't they do the same with BPD?). Have you had only one therapist this entire time? Perhaps it's time to try someone new.",Merlocked,b1ufh4

9,"Thank you for writing all of this.

I would like to point out in a non-defensive manner that I do take responsibility, it's that it's negative towards me. For instance, if I lash out, I will almost immediately say, ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that, I'm a shit girlfriend and you would be better off without me."" Because I feel that way. I don't want to have an outburst and when I do I feel so incredibly embarrassed and guilty that I blame myself but then also ridicule myself as well.

I know when my spirals are coming, but they happen too fast for me to stop and ask for help, and they're too strong to get out of. I have a constant fear of abandonment and it makes me say and do things in an attempt to keep those around me to stay around me. And if my boyfriend and I have a disagreement, I'm terrified he will leave me.

He's incredibly supportive and I appreciate him more than words can say, but I just don't want this. I don't want BPD.

She said I wouldn't be happy with her some days.",neurocentricx,b1ufh4

14,"By including self degradation in your apology you are being defensive. You are causing the person your apologizing to to feel bad for you. An apology needs to be about the other person, better to say like “I’m sorry, it was wrong for me to say that, I let my feelings get the best of me and reacted without thinking” A real apology also requires a change of behavior, not just feeling bad. Take some time and reflect on why it was wrong and then apologize without feeling bad. Guilt is useful as a catalyst for change, but focusing too much on feeling bad about your actions will prevent real self reflection and change.

1,"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

Consider. First love is more of a big deal than we think. Our first love can shape how we see relationships, what we expect of them, how we see ourselves as romantic partners, there is a whole shabang here.

If its traumatic, it can become a big deal. My old therapist used to say that we're not rigged to seek happiness, but rather to avoid pain, and that avoiding pain becomes so important that we feel it to be a survival instinct.

How to overcome. Well, we're not made equal on that regard, and thus what helps anyone else might not help you, but lets try.

Rationalizing the feeling helps. Understanding that your brain is sending you what might be a faulty danger signal might help you to not fall for it. 

Acknowledging it for what it is (the result of a traumatic event) might help you avoid the pitfall of anxiety.

Also, try to not catastrophize the concept. Jumping to the conclusion of ""I might be broken forever"" is fueling the flame of the faulty signal in your brain. Remember: people are different, and what happened then might never happen again: you're now older, smarter and have more experience. A calm you will not make the same mistakes that an anxious you might make.

Good luck.",Mean-Comfortable-938,x6uzpf

Well, that makes sense: you're not exactly the same person. Important things change us, shape us into different people, sometimes for good, sometimes for bad.

Bear in mind that so far, you've managed to skip around the feeling of ""I need to change something in me"" enough to not ask for help, even if it is on Reddit. Taking that first step means you're starting to tackle with your issues, and that progress eventually leads to a wiser you.

It's very hard to rationalize when your brain goes overdrive. You feel under threat, thus, your brain cannot do anything other than react instead of ""maybe there is another way"". The first step should be, (IMO), acknowledge that there is no absolute immediate threat. It tends to help.

You've already taken a big step.",Mean-Comfortable-938,x6uzpf

I am 35 and the last couple years have been the worst of my life in adjusting to the new anxieties about age and other bits you've mentioned. I am always thinking about the future, also.

Thirties bring changes to how our bodies operate - including our minds, so naturally these changes can make us feel super uncomfortable and really anxious. You're not alone in these types of thoughts!!

I have had to really work hard at mindfulness activities and journalling. The more I am in the here and now, the more the future can't take hold. I also try and do little things that will ease some anxieties like making a dental appointment etc. Once you do something that takes control of one of the worries, you feel empowered and it can bring calm to a small corner of your mind.

It takes lots of practise though, regularly, and honestly, sometimes, some days, it is just too darn hard !! Be kind to yourself - Each day, you're doing the best you can :-)",,e5ur1o

2,"How much is this impacting on your life? If it’s getting worse, it’s worth seeing your GP and maybe getting a referral to a psychologist. 
I don’t think DBT is necessarily the answer here. DBT is a very intense form of group and individual therapy and often hard to get into as spots are taken by people with BPD. If you haven’t tried CBT this is probably a good spot to start, but can be a bit “your thoughts are wrong”. The general idea behind it is challenging unhelpful assumptions and ideas. So kind of asking you “why are you worried about cavities?” And then working it through so you realise it’s not rational to worry about it, IF you’re very unlikely to have cavities/there is evidence to the contrary (such as you’ve been to the dentist a week ago).
Another option if you aren’t ready for therapy is to do some workbooks on your own. The Centre for Clinical Interventions has different free workbooks for a variety of conditions that are about 8-12 mini workbooks long.",victoriousbbyg,e5ur1o

The way you describe how people react to you is how I have seen others react to people with personality disorders, especially borderline personality disorder.  
And I'm sorry it's such a horrible term.  Ugh.  From a social work perspective, personality disorders are just deeply ingrained, pervasive coping mechanisms that cemented themselves into one's personality.  This is usually due to childhood trauma of some sort.  
I don't like how focused the Borderline Diagnosis is on cutting/self-destruction.  I think, more importantly, it's these traits:
1) ""Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment""
2) ""A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation""
3) ""Identity disturbance, such as a significant and persistent unstable self-image or sense of self""
4)  Some impulsivity and emotional instability 
5)  Chronic feelings of emptiness

1,"Greetings u/ShadowFistox! This is such a great question because I believe that it is something that everyone grapples with from time to time. It is often easily ignored during good times, but reminders of our mortality can threaten our own ideas of safety and result in extended grieving or depression.   


I like that you used the word ""accept"". Dialectical behavior therapy describes a practice called ""radical acceptance"" that can very helpful. Here is a list of practices you can try on your own: [https://bit.ly/3cGVR08](https://bit.ly/3cGVR08)  


One more small note about dialectical behavior therapy. Most of its practices are meant to be interruptive of our negative thoughts. Many of them begin by using the ""Stop"" skill. This means to literally stop in place, say the word ""stop"" aloud, and settle into your body for a moment. Think of this as the same starting steps to meditation. It just allows our mindsets to be a little more malleable and accepting for the rest of the activity.  


I wish you the best of luck and if you ever need someone to talk to, I am always around.",,nzyb3n

2,"Duke, I suggest you take a look at [What Works in the Treatment of BPD](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40473-017-0103-z.pdf). This 2017 review summarizes advances in treatments for adults with borderline personality disorder (BPD) in the period 2012 to 2017. It explains that over 13 treatments for BPD have been empirically tested.  
  
However, only 5 major treatments — Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), mentalization-based treatment (MBT), schema-focused therapy (SFT), transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP), and systems training for emotional predictability and problem solving (STEPPS) — have been established as treatments for which there is empirical evidence of them being effective.  
  
This 2017 review concludes that DBT is shown to be the most effective generally but that, for certain pwBPD, one of the other 4 major treatments may be a better fit. If your psychologist recommends DBT but you are having to wait for admission to a DBT program, you can make some progress on your own -- if you're strongly self motivated -- by acquiring a DBT workbook to start training at home. Of course, you will learn far more under professional guidance but you can make some progress on your own.  
  
To that end, I would recommend [Skills Training Manual for Treating BPD](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0898620341/qid=1101791170/sr=2-1/ref=p) by Marsha Linehan and [The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook](http://www.newharbinger.com/bookstore/productdetails.cfm?sku=5136) by Dr. Matthew McKay and others.  
  
A wealth of DBT information is available at [DBT Self Help](https://www.dbtselfhelp.com/), which contains many DBT videos and links to resources. This site was primarily written by pwBPD who have taken the DBT training and are describing in videos what they experienced and learned. Some professionals also contribute to that site. Regardless of which training program you undertake there in the UK, Duke, I wish you the very best in your endeavors!",Up-Town,qsbz6p
3,"What's most important is coping in a moment of crisis. The treatments for CPTSD and BPD both have ways to do this. In CPTSD, it's called dysregulation -  fancy word for getting upset.  
  
In this video, author Anna Runkle talks about her study of Complex PTSD and summarizes treatments shown to help. She says that as a CPTSD survivor, the thing she has found most helpful to her is dealing with the symptom known as dysregulation, which is getting very upset. I would definitely see her videos on dysregulation.

0,"The few studies I have seen thus far (coming through the medical and psych media pipelines) are *anything* but conclusive. And frankly, if one knows where to look online or in the library (or on the better book selling websites), one is likely to do far better in the long run with expertly written ""bibliotherapy""... IF one has been properly diagnosed and has had a few ""orientation"" sessions with a competent therapist face-2-face. 

There are just heaps of really good self-help books and workbooks available now offering research-proven methods like the 

. . . a) cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs), including Rational-Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), collegiate critical thinking,  and Schema Therapy; the 

. . . b) ""super"" (or mindfulness-based) CBTs like Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT, the long-time gold standard for BPD symptom management), Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mind-Body Bridging Therapy (MBBT), and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR); and the 

. . . c) ""deep cleaners"" like Eye-Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing (EMDR), Hakomi Body Centered Psychotherapy (HBCP), Somatic Experiencing Psychotherapy (SEPt), Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T), and the Neuro-Affective Relational Model (NARM).

The CBTs deconstruct one's inaccurate beliefs, values, ideals, principles, convictions, rules, codes, regulations and requirements about how we or they (or the world) should / must / ought / have to be.  DBT, MBCT, ACT, MBBT and MBSR are terrific for emotional symptom management. EMDR, HBCT, SEPt, SP4T and NARM are first-rate for memory-reprocessing, sense-making and detachment from the conditioning, programming, etc. 

I currently use Ogden's Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T) as the ""interoceptive"" 9th of The 10 StEPs of Emotion Processing (a combination of ""insight meditation"" with the principles of ""general semantics""; you can find both online) to manage any time bombs that turn up, but had good results over the years with all of the above from online or published sources.

0,"While many of the ideas in the article *are* partially correct, or correct in certain circumstances (*healthy* distraction *is* one of the coping mechanisms suggested by therapists who use [DBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dialectical+behavior+therapy), for example), [ANS](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=autonomic%20nervous%20system)-arousing games can be as (or more) counter-productive as they may be useful. 

Agitation of the ANS into even low-grade ""[fight-flight-or-freeze](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=fight+flight+or+freeze)"" can be expected to induce anxiety, depression and mania in many mental illness patients, in a neurophysiological manner similar to obsessive sex, over-exercise or substance abuse. 

I appreciate that one-on-one psychotherapy for such problems can be expensive, but in today's world, one-on-one work really isn't necessary most of the time. 

I use [SP4T](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=sensorimotor+therapy) as the 9th of the [10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-10-steps-of-emotion-processing.html) nowadays, but had good results over the years with [REBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy), collegiate [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking), several of the [CBTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy), [EMDR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=emdr%20therapy), [DBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dialectical+behavior+therapy), [MBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness-based+cognitive+therapy), [ACT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=acceptance+%26+commitment+therapy), [MBBT](https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/introduction-mind-body-bridging-i-system), [MBSR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness+based+stress+reduction+therapy), [SEPt]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_Experiencing), [BCP/MCSP]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Hakomi+Mindfulness-Centered+Somatic+Psychotherapy) and [NARM](http://www.drlaurenceheller.com/Intro_to_NARM.html)... all of which I was able to learn online or from books... and often do in inexpensive workbooks (mostly, but not entirely from New Harbinger, in Oakland, CA).

1,"As an anecdotal experience, some games with an aggressive bent (specifically, the original DOOM) have calmed me down when I was having a depression/anxiety freak out. I even made a post about it here on Reddit when it happened. 

My primary problem is depression, rather than anxiety, but taking a few moments to blast through a few of the anxiety-inducing levels of DOOM were soothing. There are a lot of factors there, my nostalgia for the game, the art style being so removed from realism, etc. And there are a lot of different flavors of depression and anxiety. 

Then there are a lot of other kinds of games out there. Civilization IV is also a very soothing game with a completely different mindset behind it. Empire management, which requires complex tasks to be performed and requires a great deal of mental run time. Hunie Pop is a puzzle/dating sim. Final Fantasy, a jRPG series with turn based combat and emphasis on exploration, are good options. 

There's a bit of a taboo about taking a game break, especially at work which is really bad for those of us who don't have jobs where taking a quick break at the onset of an episode is -- if not condemned, frowned upon. 

",cracked_armor,5dg583
2,"Yes; if your primary problem is depression, the *stimulation* afforded by playing the game can in fact be functional. And I would say this is especially so if your particular ""brand"" of depression is more genetic and neurobiological than it is cognitive > affective > behavioral. See below (picked up from material I use with patients):

1) If you're taking drugs of any kind (including alcohol), take yourself to a detox and get off of them with expert help. (This kind of depression is actually chronic, cyclical, feedback-looping over-stimulation and [withdrawal](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=drug+withdrawal+psychology).)

2) If you came from a [crazy-making family](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dysfunctional+family), get yourself to an [ACA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=adult+children+of+alcoholics+) meeting and read everything on their website before making any further decisions. (You'll find you are not only not alone, but that thousands of other people have found their way out of the ""soup"" in ACA.)

3) If you [stressed](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=autonomic+stress+response) your way into depression, understand that your [autonomic nervous system](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=autonomic+nervous+system) is probably tilted out of balance, and that rest, relaxation, vitamins, healthy food and appropriate medications and supplements (not always including anti-depressants, btw) offer good possibilities.

4) If you have [thought](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=cognitive+distortions) your way into depression with shame, guilt, worry, remorse, regret and morbid reflection, dig into the better cognitive psychotherapies like [REBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=rebt+therapy), [CBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=cbt+therapy), [critical thinking](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=critical+thinking) and [schema therapy](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=schema+therapy), all of which have much better than even potential of getting your mind out of the mental mush and into reality.

1,"aaw, sweetie don't be so hard on yourself. Really, worrying about it is only going to make it worse.

In general, when the tears come, taking some deep breaths and telling yourself it's okay, getting some fresh air, spashing your face with water and similar things can help.

However, with this type of pattern, I can't help but think there may be some underlying causes. The past three years have been tough on most of us and our social skills.

Be honest with yourself, are you okay? Has something been bothering you without you realising it? Have you maybe been bottling up some stuff that needs out? Crying isn't necessarily a bad thing. Yes, it's uncomfortable when it happens in public, but a good hard cry can actually be therapeutic. Crying releases stress hormones, which is why we usually feel better after a good cry. So. I'd say, have a good cry in the privacy of your home with plenty of huggables and ice cream (or whatever is comforting to you) and see if it helps. if the problem persists, consider seeking professional help or talking to someone you trust.

Nothing major happened to me personally, not to anyone close to me so I just don't understand? Not knowing the cause makes it hard to fight the problem...",Ill-Lengthiness-5751,u7f1sl
0,"I don't think explaining yourself is manipulation. 

Maybe you want to try and get the other person to see your point, you're afraid that they won't, that they'll misunderstand you. Or maybe you're afraid of being wrong, so you explain a lot? I'm not sure from the short post. Either way, explanation is not manipulation, wanting to be understood is not manipulation. It's a very human need, and it affects us differently.

If you're trying to tell someone you care, probably the best way is through actions, instead of trying to repeat it. You care for someone, then try to be there when they need something, or do small talk, and try to do what they seem to want to do - e.g. if they don't want to talk, even if you feel they would benefit and that you'd make a good listener - you shouldn't force them to talk. Instead, don't take it personally, don't take it as something against you - it's about them. And just say that if they ever want to talk, you're there.

On the other hand, if you care about someone, and you want to spend time with them you should say that too. But don't try to put it in a way that makes it sound like it's for them. Being honest that you like to spend time with someone isn't a bad thing - it may feel a little vulnerable to say ""I like hanging out with you, maybe we can do something"" - but that vulnerability is also how you gain trust. Rejection might hurt, but remind yourself that asking simple things like wanting to hang out is nothing wrong, just a human need, and don't let that feeling of hurt turn into anger - for your benefit, it will only make things worse.

I don't know a good way of dealing with fear of abandonment. I know it too, and I'm not really good at dealing with it. I think the best thing is to never imagine that you absolutely *need* someone. When you do that, you become filled with fear. It's more about just accepting that people may not want to stick around, that they may want to leave. And that you'll absolutely be ok if that happens. But don't take it personally and definitely try not to overthink it. You might be tempted to analyze it, but the reality is, there is no way of knowing what another person feels, so there's no good way to analyze situations.

1,"You are not alone in the slightest. There are a lot of people like you that feel emotion as deeply and intensely as you. I have Borderline Personality Disorder, and feeling intense emotions and emotional dysregulation is the hallmark symptom of it. Not saying that you have BPD, or anything. I look at it like there are a subset of us who have this innate strong sense of emotion, and those who are given the proper environment and skills go on to be able to manage it throughout life without too much trouble. However, those of us that experience trauma, an invalidating environment, and/or aren't taught the proper skills tend to have trouble managing our intense emotions later on, resulting in things like BPD. If you're struggling with intense emotions and feeling like you're absorbing the emotions of those around you, I would highly recommend Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). It teaches you those skills needed to manage these intense emotions that we unfortunately were not taught due to whatever circumstances. If you don't want to enroll in an actual therapy program, there are DBT workbooks that you can buy on Amazon that you can work on yourself even. I'd recommend *The Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Skills Workbook* as a start. *DBT Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets* if you wanted something a bit more in depth. Best of luck to you.

---

>__Dialectical behavior therapy__ (__DBT__) is a therapy designed to help people change patterns of behavior that are not effective, such as self-harm, suicidal thinking, and substance abuse.  This approach works towards helping people increase their emotional and cognitive regulation by learning about the triggers that lead to reactive states and helping to assess which coping skills to apply in the sequence of events, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to help avoid undesired reactions. DBT assumes that people are doing the best they can but are either lacking the skills or influenced by positive or negative reinforcement that interfere with their ability to function appropriately.

0,"This is how *I* deal with it:

1) Substance Abuse: IF one is using alcohol, nicotine in any form, or other substances, they'll have to stop. SA can cause -- or worsen -- this in people with specific genetics and behavioral conditioning (see below). Alcoholics Anonymous, Marijuana Anonymous and/or Narcotics Anonymous can be helpful. Or using the SAMHSA facility locator online to find a detox & rehab. 

2) If one is NOT doing the above, they may need lab work to determine if they have hormonal (e.g.: thyroid) or metabolic (e.g.: low Vitamin D3) imbalances. See a competent MD, DO, PA or NP. (To find one in your area, use the clinician locators mentioned below or get a referral from your GP/PC doc.)

3) Medications, but *only if really needed* to get one stabilized enough to do next seven things on this list: Find a board certified psychopharmacologist in your area by using the physician locators below. Getting psych meds from a GP or primary care doc can be useless or even risky. Psych diagnoses, meds and med interactions are just too complex now for most GPs and primary care docs.

4) Support Groups: Adult Children of Alcoholics / Dysfunctional Families (ACA), Emotions Anonymous (EA), and Codependents Anonymous (CoDA)... where you will find others in similar boats who have found explanations, answers and solutions. All of their websites have meeting locators.

5) Books and academic, *professional* websites including Mayo Clinic, WebMD, NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health), NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), and even Wikipedia (when everything asserted is solidly documented with citations). Strongly recommended: Alexander Chapman & Kimberly Gratz's *The Borderline Personality Disorder Survival Guide: Everything You Need to Know About Living with BPD*, and because they all understand the upshots of having been stressed into fight, flight or freeze for too long, including complex PTSD: Bessel van der Kolk, Peter Levine, Patricia Ogden, Ronald Kurtz, Laurence Heller, Bruce McEwen, Sonya Lupien and Robert Sapolsky. Look for an online article entitled ""Treat Autonomic AND Cognitive Conditions in Psychopathology?"" to get you oriented. *Accurate* information is power.

6) Psychotherapy: I currently use Ogden's Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T) as the ""interoceptive"" 9th of The 10 StEPs of Emotion Processing (a combination of ""insight meditation"" with the principles of ""general semantics""; you can find both online) to manage any time bombs that turn up, but had good results over the years with several of the 

. . . a) cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs), including Rational-Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), collegiate critical thinking,  and Schema Therapy; the 

. . . b) ""super"" (or mindfulness-based) CBTs like Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT, the long-time gold standard for BPD symptom management), Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mind-Body Bridging Therapy (MBBT), and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR); and the 

. . . c) ""deep cleaners"" like Eye-Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing (EMDR), Hakomi Body Centered Psychotherapy (HBCP), Somatic Experiencing Psychotherapy (SEPt), Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T), and the Neuro-Affective Relational Model (NARM).

The CBTs deconstruct one's inaccurate beliefs, values, ideals, principles, convictions, rules, codes, regulations and requirements about how we or they (or the world) should / must / ought / have to be.  DBT, MBCT, ACT, MBBT and MBSR are terrific for emotional symptom management. EMDR, HBCT, SEPt, SP4T and NARM are first-rate for memory-reprocessing, sense-making and detachment from the conditioning, programming, etc. 

To find the clinicians who know how to use these psychotherapies, look on the ""therapists"" and ""psychiatrists"" sections of the *Psychology Today*.com clinician locator, on the ""find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry"" section of the WebMD website, the SAMHSA's treatment facility locator, and -- for DBT specialists in particular -- on the Behavioraltech.org website. If you dig a little on each page, you will be able to see which therapies they use. Then interview *them* as though they were applying for a job with *your* company. Most psychiatrists, btw, are *not* therapists themselves (they are medication specialists), but can refer you to those who are, and are often excellent sources of referral.

7) Mindfulness Meditation: Try the Vipassana or Theravada Meditation styles? (For a *lot* of people with anxiety, unwanted mania and depression, this stuff handles them all chop chop. Many of the modern ""mindfulness""-based psychotherapies are actually based on these now.) The article ""The Feeling is Always Temporary"" at pairadocks.blogspot.com provides a nice summation of it. 

8) Therapy Workbooks: I got a lot of lift-off by using inexpensive workbooks built on CBT, ACT, DBT, MBBT and MBCT. They are easily found online. The very best of the DBT workbooks include:

Chapman, A.; Gratz, K.; Tull, M.: *The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook for Anxiety: Breaking Free from Worry, Panic, PTSD & Other Anxiety Symptoms*, Oakland CA: New Harbinger, 2011. 

Chapman, A.; Gratz, K.; Tull, M.: *The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook for Anger: Using DBT Mindfulness & Emotion Regulation Skills to Manage Anger*, Oakland CA: New Harbinger, 2015.

Marra, T.: *Depressed & Anxious: The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Workbook for Overcoming Depression & Anxiety*, Oakland, CA: New Harbinger, 2004. 

McKay, M.; Wood, J.; Brantley, J.: *The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook*, Oakland, CA: New Harbinger, 2007.  

McKay, M.; Fanning, P.; Ona, P. Z.: *Mind and Emotions: A Universal Treatment for Emotional Disorders*, Oakland, CA: New Harbinger, 2011.

Van Dijk, S.: *DBT Made Simple: A Step-by-Step Guide to Dialectical Behavior Therapy*, Oakland, CA: New Harbinger, 2013.  

9) Moderate Exercise: Because it is the single healthiest of the distractions one can use to yank oneself out of the paradigm for a while... *and* it can help to ""massage"" the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy.

10) Diet: A lot of people with depression, mania and/or anxiety eat *very* poorly. Junk food -- not to mention too *little* nutritious food -- will definitely impact those who are overly stressed and make symptoms worse. High-quality frozen meals are better than McFood of almost any kind, but HQ *fresh* (especially Mediterranean -- though not *pizza* -- and Asian) food appears to be best for pts with C-PTSD symptoms. *Healthy* fats in moderation, btw, are known to be good for depression. Add a 1000 IU soft gel of Vitamin D3, too.

Of the ten, #3 and #6 are the only ones that cost much, and several are totally free.

1,"I also have BPD, and I still don't have it completely under control, but I'm improving. 

- Therapy is incredibly important for me. I need to have a therapist that I feel a strong bond with. If I didn't click with a therapist in the past, I found it ineffective. If you have trouble affording therapy, there are usually resources for reduced fees or sliding scales. Don't let money be a barrier. DBT groups are also an important resource.  

- Mindfulness. I try to pay attention to what I'm feeling. It's easier to manage my anxiety if I can catch it and practice some self care before it escalates into panic or anxiety attacks. 

- I practice walking away from conflict, or when I start to feel myself becoming unbalanced. This is the hardest thing in the world for me, but when I'm calm I often realize that my reactions when I was upset don't reflect how I /really/ feel.

- The Buddha and the Borderline is a memoire was a great book to read. It's more about personal experience and very little about Buddhism. It can be a little emotionally heavy and triggering at times, but it helps to know that someone else experiences the same kinds of problems.

- Lamictal. I'm not a fan of most medications, but this mood stabilizer has hardly any side effects (I don't experience any, and especially not the dreaded weight gain or lack of energy.) and it helps me a lot. It's a very popular med for that reason.

- Knowing when to seek help. When I'm feeling suicidal and know I might hurt myself, I try to reach out. Sometimes this just means having someone to talk to, or going to the hospital. There is no shame in taking care of your mental health.   ",,5xaht3

If you're unable to access DBT, at least know about the DBT methods for coping in a moment of crisis, when you're tempted to hurt yourself or hurt someone else.  
  
It's very important to calm down. This will make you feel better and let you think clearly. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.  
   
   
Simple distractions can help - things that change your mood like beautiful music or a funny video.

The article ""The Feeling is Always Temporary"" at pairadocks.blogspot.com provides a nice summation of it. 

8) Therapy Workbooks: I got a lot of lift-off by using inexpensive workbooks built on CBT, ACT, DBT, MBBT and MBCT. They are easily found online. The very best of the DBT workbooks include:

Chapman, A.; Gratz, K.; Tull, M.: *The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook for Anxiety: Breaking Free from Worry, Panic, PTSD & Other Anxiety Symptoms*, Oakland CA: New Harbinger, 2011.

9) Moderate Exercise: Because it is the single healthiest of the distractions one can use to yank oneself out of the paradigm for a while... *and* it can help to ""massage"" the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy.

10) Diet: A lot of people with depression, mania and/or anxiety eat *very* poorly. Junk food -- not to mention too *little* nutritious food -- will definitely impact those who are overly stressed and make symptoms worse. High-quality frozen meals are better than McFood of almost any kind, but HQ *fresh* (especially Mediterranean -- though not *pizza* -- and Asian) food appears to be best for pts with C-PTSD symptoms. *Healthy* fats in moderation, btw, are known to be good for depression. Add a 1000 IU soft gel of Vitamin D3, too.

0,"I would tell his therapist. They are mandated reporters and can take action. He will likely be involuntarily hospitalized (depending on where you live). 

If you are in the states you can call this number:1-800-273-TALK (8255). It's the National Suicide Prevention Line. ",OnionsMadeMeDoIt,5z0hpj
1,"So this bargaining/manipulation thing is part of his disorder. Call his therapist. Unless he has signed a release for you to talk to his therapist (and you are in the us) you will have to say it like this:

""Hello. I am (your husband's name)'s wife. I know that you cannot confirm or deny that you see him so I just want to pass on information to you because I am afraid for his safety."" (Do not expect the therapist to say much to you because legally this person isn't really allowed to acknowledge much). Explain what you said here and say ""thank you."" Providers are allowed to breach confidentiality when safety is involved and so the therapist might be able to talk to you at that point. I'm not entirely sure about all of the legal ramifications there or his therapist's personal ethics. 

Under no circumstances do you just ignore this or allow your husband to do this. This is classic Borderline. It doesn't make it evil or anything but it is part of his illness and enabling that is really harmful. He may or may not be planning on actually following through with this plan. The problem is, suicidal gestures are very common in BPD and even ones that aren't intended to be completed can end up that way. Often, there is a sort of ambivalence about whether the attempt succeeds or not. Sometimes, a statement like that is meant to provoke an emotional response from you and draw you closer in the ""I hate you, don't leave me"" cycle. Whatever it is, you really can't afford to ignore it because he really could be in danger. It is certainly not something I would be trying to gamble with. 

I can understand that you would be concerned about his threats about disappearing, but if you think this through, if he follows through with his plan and kills himself, he's gone anyway. I'm not trying to be morbid here but that is a lousy manipulative tactic. ""If you tell anyone that I am going to kill myself and disappear, I will just disappear."" So you lose either way. At least if you try to get him help, he will be alive to fight with or find. 

Mental illness sucks. It makes those of us who suffer from it make stupid statements, come up with bad ideas, and often not make a lot of logical sense. The good news, and what he doesn't seem to know yet, is BPD is totally treatable. Lots of people recover actually. It's not necessarily a life sentence. There is hope. He just needs to be in the right situation to hear that and it might need to be the inside of an inpatient unit (which, having seen the inside of several, is nowhere near as terrifying as you might imagine if you have never seen it). 

I wish you the best. 
",ivybelle,5z0hpj
2,"I agree with u/OnionsMadeMeDoIt... and (because BPD is NOT the ""kiss of death"" it was believed to be even ten years ago) suggest looking into...

1) The Five Stages of Recovery at pairadocks.blogspot.com to see where they are on that list at any given time ( because it *will* vary).

2) The ""four types of borderline personality disorder"" via a good search engine (I used to provide the links, but so doing creates a labor  problem for the moderators on this sub-reddit; sorry) to see what applies (it's usually two or more in polarized opposition to each other).

3) The Patterns & Characteristics of codependency on the CoDA.org website about both of you.

4) The ""Karpman Drama Triangle"" to see where you, they and their family members are on it most of the time.

5) ""Family secrets"" and the ""emotional blackmail"" used to protect them, because it is typical in the childhood families of those who ignored, abandoned, discounted, disclaimed, and rejected -- as well as invalidated, confused, betrayed, insulted, criticized, judged, blamed, embarrassed, humiliated, ridiculed, victimized, demonized, persecuted, picked on, dumped on, bullied, scapegoated, and/or otherwise abused, which is usually (not always) the case for those with BPD.

6) ""Reactive attachment disorder,"" because it is usually what the child acquires when abused by those they must depend upon to survive. 

7) The Codependents Anonymous website meeting locator for your area... and go to six before making a decision to continue or not... because it is likely that you will need to know about ""psychological boundaries"" and how to raise and lower them appropriately as they struggle with -- and seem to flip back and forth from -- fear of intolerable abuse here and fear of intolerable abandonment there.  

8) Any professionally written book on ""adult survivors of child abuse."" If applicable, pick one or two, and read them.

9) The *Borderline Personality Disorder Survival Guide* by Alex Chapman & Kimberly Gratz for your own sake, regardless of what they do or don't do.

And understand that...

1) They *may* (we do not diagnose here) have one or more of the [four types of BPD](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=four+types+of+bpd&*) as a coping system for the ""complex post-traumatic stress disorder"" that is typical among adult survivors. The best psychotherapies for it are those that understand the causes resulting in and physiological conditions of a shredded autonomic nervous system no longer capable of managing their ""fight-flight-freeze"" responses to stress and perceived threat.

2) IF the subject is using alcohol or other substances, they'll have to stop. SA can greatly worsen BPD in people with specific genetics and behavioral conditioning (see below). Alcoholics Anonymous, Marijuana Anonymous and/or Narcotics Anonymous can be helpful. Or using the SAMHSA facility locator online to find a detox & rehab.

3) Dialectical Behavior Therapy is the current gold standard for managing the emotions and behaviors that come with BPD & complex PTSD. One can find people in their area who know how to administer it through the BehavioralTech LLC website, as well as inexpensive,  adjunct therapy workbooks written by DBT professionals. One can also get a lot of support from DBTSelfHelp.com and organizations like DBT New Jersey, so dig around for them online, but advise the trauma survivor *not* to try to ""get well"" on the cheap.

4) To truly scrape out the bottom of the bucket of complex post-traumatic stress disorder, one can get into the Eye-Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing (EMDR), Hakomi Body Centered Psychotherapy (HBCP), Somatic Experiencing Psychotherapy (SEPt), Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T), and the Neuro-Affective Relational Model (NARM) psychotherapies, which are the most widely research-supported for the *causes* of C-PTSD and BPD. In time, they may need one of more of these to clean up the lingering residues and rewire their ""limbic emotion regulation system.""

5) Neuroleptic medications are very often (though not always) helpful for BPD, especially for the petulant, impulsive and self-destructive / self-harming types. ""Discouraged"" BPDs *may* do better with anti-depressants, but I say ""may"" *very* advisedly because of the rapid switching from ""sympathetic"" to ""parasympathetic"" pitch in the ""autonomic 'fight / flight / freeze' nervous system"" that is common among all borderlines. 

6) Therapy Workbooks: I got a lot of lift-off by using inexpensive workbooks built on CBT, ACT, DBT, MBBT and MBCT. They are easily found online. The very best of the DBT workbooks include:

Chapman, A.; Gratz, K.; Tull, M.: *The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook for Anxiety: Breaking Free from Worry, Panic, PTSD & Other Anxiety Symptoms*, Oakland CA: New Harbinger, 2011.

Van Dijk, S.: *DBT Made Simple: A Step-by-Step Guide to Dialectical Behavior Therapy*, Oakland, CA: New Harbinger, 2013.  

I have myself recovered from what was pretty florid BPD 20 years ago, with severe anxiety, compensatory mania, suicidality and other upshots of complex PTSD by using Ogden's Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T) as the interoceptive 9th of The 10 StEPs of Emotion Processing (you can find online) to manage any ""time bombs"" that turn up, but had good results over the years with several of the cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs), including Rational-Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), collegiate critical thinking, Schema Therapy, and Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT); as well as the ""super"" (or mindfulness-based) CBTs like Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT, the long-time gold standard for BPD symptom management), Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mind-Body Bridging Therapy (MBBT), and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR); and the ""deep cleaners"" like Eye-Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing (EMDR), Hakomi Body Centered Psychotherapy (HBCP), Somatic Experiencing Psychotherapy (SEPt), Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T), and the Neuro-Affective Relational Model (NARM).

To find the clinicians who know how to use these psychotherapies, look on the ""therapists"" and ""psychiatrists"" sections of the *Psychology Today*.com clinician locator, on the ""find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry"" section of the WebMD website, the SAMHSA's treatment facility locator, and -- for DBT specialists in particular -- on the Behavioraltech.org website. If you dig a little on each page, you will be able to see which therapies they use. Then interview *them* as though they were applying for a job with *your* company. Most psychiatrists, btw, are *not* therapists themselves (they are medication specialists), but can refer you to those who are, and are often excellent sources of referral.

""If one was regularly ignored, abandoned, discounted, disclaimed, and rejected -- as well as invalidated, confused, betrayed, insulted, criticized, judged, blamed, embarrassed, humiliated, ridiculed, victimized, demonized, persecuted, picked on, dumped on, bullied, scapegoated, and/or otherwise abused -- by others upon whom they depended for survival in early life, and/or they are highly stressed by school, work, relationships or other chronic life challenges, they may have been programmed, conditioned, socialized and/or normalized to conflicting beliefs, values, ideals, principles, convictions, rules, codes, regulations and requirements about how we or they (or the world) should / must / ought / have to be, and then beat themselves up for not being able to meet their conflicting expectations and requirements.""

If you relate to that description above, and it *is* the case, here's a research-proven road map out of the jungle (I used to be able to provide links, but so doing requires a lot of review-&-approval labor by the moderators here, so please look up whatever terms you don't understand):

1) Substance Abuse: IF one is using alcohol, nicotine in any form, or other substances, they'll have to stop. SA can cause -- or worsen -- this in people with specific genetics and behavioral conditioning (see below). Alcoholics Anonymous, Marijuana Anonymous and/or Narcotics Anonymous can be helpful. Or using the SAMHSA facility locator online to find a detox & rehab. 

2) If one is NOT doing the above, they may need lab work to determine if they have hormonal (e.g.: thyroid) or metabolic (e.g.: low Vitamin D3) imbalances. See a competent MD, DO, PA or NP. (To find one in your area, use the clinician locators mentioned below or get a referral from your GP/PC doc.)

3) Medications, but *only if really needed* to get one stabilized enough to do next seven things on this list: Find a board certified psychopharmacologist in your area by using the physician locators below. Getting psych meds from a GP or primary care doc can be useless or even risky. Psych diagnoses, meds and med interactions are just too complex now for most GPs and primary care docs.

4) Support Groups: Adult Children of Alcoholics / Dysfunctional Families (ACA), Emotions Anonymous (EA), and Codependents Anonymous (CoDA)... where you will find others in similar boats who have found explanations, answers and solutions. All of their websites have meeting locators.

5) Books and academic, *professional* websites including Mayo Clinic, WebMD, NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health), NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), and even Wikipedia (when everything asserted is solidly documented with citations). Strongly recommended: Alexander Chapman & Kimberly Gratz's *The Borderline Personality Disorder Survival Guide: Everything You Need to Know About Living with BPD*, and because they all understand the upshots of having been stressed into fight, flight or freeze for too long, including complex PTSD: Bessel van der Kolk, Peter Levine, Patricia Ogden, Ronald Kurtz, Laurence Heller, Bruce McEwen, Sonya Lupien and Robert Sapolsky. Look for an online article entitled ""Treat Autonomic AND Cognitive Conditions in Psychopathology?"" to get you oriented. *Accurate* information is power.

6) Psychotherapy: I currently use Ogden's Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T) as the ""interoceptive"" 9th of The 10 StEPs of Emotion Processing (a combination of ""insight meditation"" with the principles of ""general semantics""; you can find both online) to manage any time bombs that turn up, but had good results over the years with several of the 

. . . a) cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs), including Rational-Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), collegiate critical thinking,  and Schema Therapy; the 

. . . b) ""super"" (or mindfulness-based) CBTs like Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT, the long-time gold standard for BPD symptom management), Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mind-Body Bridging Therapy (MBBT), and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR); and the 

. . . c) ""deep cleaners"" like Eye-Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing (EMDR), Hakomi Body Centered Psychotherapy (HBCP), Somatic Experiencing Psychotherapy (SEPt), Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T), and the Neuro-Affective Relational Model (NARM).

The CBTs deconstruct one's inaccurate beliefs, values, ideals, principles, convictions, rules, codes, regulations and requirements about how we or they (or the world) should / must / ought / have to be.  DBT, MBCT, ACT, MBBT and MBSR are terrific for emotional symptom management. EMDR, HBCT, SEPt, SP4T and NARM are first-rate for memory-reprocessing, sense-making and detachment from the conditioning, programming, etc. 

To find the clinicians who know how to use these psychotherapies, look on the ""therapists"" and ""psychiatrists"" sections of the *Psychology Today*.com clinician locator, or the ""find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry"" section of the WebMD website; the SAMHSA's treatment facility locator, and -- for DBT specialists in particular -- on the Behavioraltech.org website.

4) Psychotherapy: I currently use Ogden's [SP4T](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-10-steps-ogdens-sensorymotor.html) as the [interoceptive](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=interoception+meditation) 9th of the [10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) to manage any ""time bombs"" that turn up, but had good results over the years with several of the [CBTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) including [REBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy), collegiate [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking), [schema therapy]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=schema+therapy), and [CPT]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_processing_therapy), as well as [DBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dialectical+behavior+therapy), [MBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness-based+cognitive+therapy), [ACT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=acceptance+%26+commitment+therapy), [MBBT](https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/introduction-mind-body-bridging-i-system), [MBSR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mindfulness+based+stress+reduction+therapy), [EMDR](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=emdr%20therapy), [HBCT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Hakomi+Mindfulness-Centered+Somatic+Psychotherapy), [SEPt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_Experiencing), and [NARM](http://www.drlaurenceheller.com/Intro_to_NARM.html).

DBT, MBCT, ACT, MBBT and MBSR are terrific for symptom management. EMDR, HBCT, SEPt, SP4T and NARM are first-rate for memory-reprocessing, sense-making and detachment from the conditioning, programming, etc.

To find the clinicians who know how to use these psychotherapies, look [here](https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/), and [here]( http://doctor.webmd.com/find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry), and [here](https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/), and (for DBT specialists in particular) [here](http://behavioraltech.org/resources/crd.cfm). If you dig a little on each page, you will be able to see which therapies they use. Then interview *them* as though they were applying for a job with *your* company. Most MD / psychiatrists, btw, are *not* therapists themselves (they are medication specialists), but can refer you to those who are, and are often -- though not always -- excellent sources of referral. 

5) Mindfulness Meditation: Try the [Vipassana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81)-style? (For a *lot* of people with anxiety, this stuff handles anxiety chop chop. Not sure about depression. Many of the modern psychotherapies for anxiety are actually based on it now.)

6) Therapy Workbooks: I got a lot of lift-off by using inexpensive workbooks like [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=stanley+block+mind+body+bridging+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=CBT+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=ACT+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=DBT+therapy+workbooks). With respect to the anger, per se, [DBT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=dialectical+behavior+therapy), [MBBT](https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/introduction-mind-body-bridging-i-system), and [ACT](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=acceptance+%26+commitment+therapy) all provide inexpensive workbooks for anger management. See [this](https://www.amazon.com/Dialectical-Behavior-Therapy-Skills-Workbook/dp/1626250219), and [this](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Body-Workbook-Anger-Management-Resolution/dp/1608829138), and [this](https://www.amazon.com/ACT-Life-Not-Anger-Acceptance/dp/1572244402), all of which I have used and can recommend. 

7) Moderate exercise: Because it is the single healthiest of the distractions one can use to yank oneself out of the paradigm for a while... *and* it can help to ""massage"" the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy.",not-moses,5l1w2o
2,"Thank you. I plan on seeing someone as soon as it becomes an option. until then I'll be trying to read up on it.

again, thank you for your time.",MostlyHonestStories,5l1w2o
3,"Granted I do not hold any authority for, nor was I trying, to actually diagnose anybody with anything. I do appreciate and fully agree with your comment. Considering that there were no other replies here, my aim was to really stress the fact that it is a possibility - and that prompt effort to seek professional help is, in any case, the single best course of action dear OP can take. I think so because of, and was especially alarmed by, the presence of delusions, hallucinations, a description of a psychotic-like state, white-outs and incidents of uncontrolled violence.

This was not with the aim to startle or to judge or to label OP by any means. This is the last thing I wish upon anybody. I am honestly just trying to help. A close friend of mine who did not seek proper diagnosis and treatment for similar kinds of experiences early enough was diagnosed with schizophrenia; but it was too late, and we lost him to psychosis from which he never returned. So I reacted emotionally to OPs post, trying to prevent a similar scenario from occurring. It is worth getting seen to, at any rate, even to just rule the possibility out and to get proper advice.",BogusProfiterole,5l1w2o
4,"Thank you for all the advice and reading material. I appreciate all the help and your insight on the matter.

It really helps alot thank you!

p.s. I'm sorry it took me like 3 days to get back to you, it's been a busy week.",MostlyHonestStories,5l1w2o
5,"TY, SM for a truly thoughtful and considered reply. I don't blame you (*at* all) for your response, considering the very understandable energy back of it.  ",not-moses,5l1w2o
