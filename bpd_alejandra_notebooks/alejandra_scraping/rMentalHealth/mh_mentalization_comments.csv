It took a lot, and I do mean a lot of work yo get where I am today.  Over 15 + years of therapy, countless drug combinations, and a lot of work on who I wanted to be as a person. 

I'm in a healthy 7+ year relationship,  I have a steady job and went back to school, I even took my kid back from their guardian at 14.  It was a struggle,  but it was worth it all.  I'm now in the process of talking to my Dr about slowly decreasing my medication,  and I'm in a better head space and life space than I've been in years.

You got this.  It may seem impossible,  like you'll never feel like a real person, but it's there.  Reach for it. You can live a full, robust life. It's just a bit more of a struggle for us.
And it's not silly to feel alone, we all do. Even ppl who look perfectly happy, feel lonely.",desdmona,1ckivpa

16,"Most of my teens to 20s were spent being depressed, I was diagnosed with manic depression in my 20s, but after 15 years, found out that my depression resulted in PTSD from when I was a child. I was misdiagnosed.

It robbed me of friendships and relationships; I isolated myself and was extremely cynical. It affected my self-esteem and I had constant self doubts. I had no support system, so I had to deal this on my own. It was tough.

Do I see it as a hindrance? Hell Yes. But I feel that to live my life without my mental illness, I wouldn't be artistic and would not be able to be as empathetic as I am now. I'm not trying to justify it, it sucks to not be able to function normally, to take medicines, to keep seeing doctors just to be deemed sane.

24,"24f. Mental illness continues to take time from me, but I've been in therapy and actively work to idiot-proof things for myself and make my life less difficult; because it's *incredibly* difficult.

I don't think I used to be dyslexic. My short term memory is on par that of a dementia patient at times; my long term memory is less impacted, but still impacted. I switch mindsets and abilities frequently. 

I have to idiot-proof everything I do because I never know when the memory lapsing will begin or end. This means marking literally everything in my phone calendar ""dinner Friday - ingredients location, recipe"". 

During the lapses, I can forget how to make the foods I've been making regularly since I was 8 years old. I try to limit myself to the air fryer and microwave during these times.

My 5 senses felt alive and I never knew why people wanted to die . The thought of giving up didn’t really hit me until I was deep in depression. Before I was depressed I had struggled with Attention deficit disorders  but it didn’t interfere with my daily life . Life still had a touch of magic in it . When you’re depressed everything you observe just seem dead and dull. Even after a while, listening to music became useless cause I realize that whatever positive emotions I felt for a moment doesn’t solve the dying feeling inside of me . Now whenever I feel some stress, there’s a lot of negative self judgement inside and I never really wanna accomplish anything anymore. It’s just really tough to be satisfied with life .

49,"Technically my whole life. I was sexually abused at 5yrs old and can't remember anything before then. I repressed the memory but definitely had issues as a small child. I got very depressed as a teenager and even more so when I uncovered the repressed memory. However the abuse happened in a strange way, I was naked against my will but it wasn't sexual for the other person. When I became a teacher I learnt the definition during Safeguarding training and realised that what happened to me did indeed count as abuse, as well as other things that happened to me counting as emotional abuse. But I didn't deal with it at the time, I was in shock and trying to be strong and just get on with life. Several years later the flashbacks were becoming uncontrollable. I had recieved some therapy during my first years at uni, before teacher training, for depression but the didn't bring up what had happened to me as a child and I wish I did because I had to get therapy all over again to come to terms with what happened to me. Needless to say i couldn't stay a teacher and I've learnt I can never be normal, I've had to learn coping mechanisms and how to talk about what's on my mind and how to do it in a calm way, rather than bottling it up and being depressed all the time.",BluPanda11,1ckivpa

After I leaved the clinic, I slowly deteriorated inside my room to the point I became very anxious and even dangerous to myself and others, many thought was directed on my self-perceived hideousness). 

My well-being gradually changed a year ago with loving parent, adequate medication (I take sertraline, Valproate and Quentiapine) and therapy.

I feel the exact dred that a lot of others have posted. I have some drunken fun memories from my early 20s, but otherwise it's been a deliberating shitshow. I have missed so many ""normal"" things and memories. I barely have any friends is just one small aspect. I was lucky to do a little bit of travelling, however I did actually spend 80-90% of my holidays in bed or just a mess when out, and the only reason I was able to travel is because my parents were scared I'd kill myself while they were away, so they dragged me along. Fortunate they could afford it at the time. I feel like I'm constantly running out of time, but then literally can't get out of bed or out of the house. Mental health is physical health too, it's great that there is more awareness ect ect, but really there's still a lot to learn for people who have never had long term health issues.

81,"Gosh, 16 years so far I guess. Dx with depression while going through my second pregnancy at 23. Then was a single mom for 8 years, battling it. Decided to force myself to get back out there. Ended up getting sexually assaulted, and not addressing it. Met my stbxh, who was big into bdsm and control. Not consensual control. I made myself smaller so he would stop trying to force me into the mold he wanted me in. I just did it myself. 

Then, almost 4 years ago, my youngest son died at 12, from SUDEP. That finally got me into therapy. Diagnosed with ptsd, depression, and anxiety. Intrusive thoughts. After the first year or so of therapy, we also started working on the sexual assault. It was hell going through every detail of it at therapy, then going home and my husband wanting to do those exact same things. He started cheating. I found out, he blamed me, so I stopped therapy. Let him do those things again. Even when he violated limits and ignored safe words. 

Last year, caught him cheating again, and when I confronted him again , he said he wanted a divorce. He loves his affair partner into our home, I moved out with my older, teenage son. Met someone new a few months ago, thought he was the one. Turns out, I’m just really bad at picking men. And, 99.6% effective on an iud does not mean 100%. 

So here I am. 39, single, raising a special needs 19 year old, and due in December. The intrusive thoughts are bad this time. I keep panicking over  what I’d there is something wrong with this child? What if it’s healthy and then dies? I’ve already buried one child. The only reason I’m still here is because my oldest kid needs me. And now I’m adding a newborn into the mix? The obgyn is calling this a high risk geriatric pregnancy. I’m in a state that doesn’t believe women have rights to their own bodies. Although, honestly, even if there was a choice, I don’t know if I could emotionally handle it, having more dead children than living ones. 

So, I’m back in therapy. The only balance of meds they had found to keep me functioning, Zoloft and Xanax, were both stopped by the Dr during this pregnancy. So I’m not sleeping, not really functioning. My unhealthy coping mechanisms, drinking and chain smoking? Also not safe.

85,"I relate to this pain as well. I'm sorry you've suffered so much too op.

My teen years were almost entirely eaten up by me just dissociating and heavily distracting myself as much as possible from my severe anxiety and depression, as well as being trapped inside from agoraphobia caused by intense bullying. I couldn't leave the house after school basically from age 14 to age 19. I grew up for that time in my parents basement and in my bedroom reading and playing computer or video games, or drawing. I also was dealing with pure O ocd, which almost led me to joining a weird pseudo-new-age cult because I was engaging in compulsions of thought-blocking and trying to use spirituality literature and nonsense online to block my intrusive thoughts by reading it profusely, trying to ""sync vibrations with the earth"" and all that stuff. It was exhaustive, silent hell and I am so glad I was able to get the pure O ocd treated. It feels like a bad dream looking back at it and I have total aversion to any religion including new age religion, which is funny cause they swear it isn't one but it is, and to top it off it is totally self-blaming and toxic. Their dogma was that everything happens to you because you will it to. That is total bs and very harmful to people who've endured early life traumas or any trauma. It's wrong in so many ways, like they are blaming helpless people for being born into tough life circumstances. The law of attraction book can drown in a tar pit where it came from. Okay I'm sorry rant over.

So now as of age 32 I feel like I'm permanently catching up on everything I missed and teaching myself everything online with tutorials and little quizzes and stuff. This also includes teaching myself formatting and inproving my English/vocabulary, cause I was too stressed and unfocused to be in academic level English class. My education was stunted by the suffocating amounts of daily internal distress. I was absolutely miserable going to school due to bullying and my parents refused to pull me out and let me finish school by correspondence. So my learning suffered badly cause I couldn't focus from the bullying and awful mental disorders happening at once. I ended up wasting hours doodling to calm myself or excessively daydreaming. I felt like teachers didn't care that much and were kind of useless. I also have adhd and autism, as well as dyscalculia and could not handle math, so I had to do the lowest level of math for basic life skills/working class level or something, can't remember what they called it.

At that time I didn’t know anything about depression left alone or that I was dealing with trauma. Things got better at 18 and felt that I could get on track again. I was having more friends, started dating, used to go out a lot more. However, I found it difficult or even scary to be by myself because my thoughts would go back to those horrific events in my life. So I was always looking for distractions, like going out, having fun and was always in need to be around people. At the age of 22 which was during the pandemic that’s when I really had a breakdown. I lost my job, a lot of friends which made things complicated and felt super lonely. At some point it felt like I had no grip on my life anymore. Suddenly inwas no longer interested in certain things, my life seemed so ugly and joyless. Thankfully we are now living in a world whereby we take our mental health seriously. This also encouraged me to seek for help and started going to therapy. However, I still had a different perception on that, I thought that everything would be the same again. But my issues had so many layers and the first layer actually got ‘removed’ by my first therapist. I don’t know if that is a part of healing but it seemed like all the pain that hidden inside of me were about to be released. I was dealing with all kinds of emotions. But I was mostly bitter and angry. Unfortunately things started to go rocky ever since. I decided to go to therapy again because it felt like my situation had worsened. I was also very suicidal. Again another layer was removed and started to release more pain than before. To the point that I started to feel tired. After my second time my body felt so calm, much calmer than before that I started to sleep more even through the day. My body temperature increased too. This was last year btw. I honestly don’t know how I can describe this year. All I can say is that I feel quite unhappy and that I don’t know to fix that. I’m not sure wether I am depressed again or that it’s just a phase. Maybe I’m going through a change I just don’t know. I just hope for the best. 

All I can say is mental illness is real and it had a huge impact on my life. Despite that I was in a denial and quite ashamed about my issues I’m glad that I choose to get help. But it seems like I’m not getting better especially right now. I struggle to take care of myself, I have a bad sleeping pattern, I find it difficult to focus on school and so on.

104,"Wasted away my entire 40s living on my couch, and putting up with increasingly violent behavior from my live- in boyfriend. I was put on oodles of SSRIs, mood stabilizers, anti psychotics etc. None of those meds ever helped. It was before treatment-resistant depression became a thing. 

I didn't think I could sell my house bc it was in disrepair. I thought you had to have an open house in order to sell a home, and my homes interior had been neglect and my expensive Karastan carpets were all messed up by my my cats, and having an open house was impossible, I was ashamed of my once lovely home 

My taxes were 12k a year and I needed my boyfriends income to help pay them bc my SSD wouldn't have allowed me pay taxes and other expenses. Boyfriend went from kindhearted soul to violent abusive maniac who'd beat me up every few months, over this 10 Year period. 

My depression kept me in this awful loop of needing his income, putting up with domestic violence
and thinking I couldn't sell house situation for a very long decade 

Long story short I finally got his ass put in jail, and learned that homes don't  need to be in pristine Open house condition, and  sold house ""as-is"". 

Do I got over that dilemma but next bf caused mucho problems too and went thru 5 yrs of hell living with him. He had no.my issues. 

I'm 60 now and living alone. I finally in my 50s was surprisingly diagnosed ADHD. And stimulant ADHD Meds are the only things to ever grieve my depression. But they wear off and the depression is always there,my constant unwelcomed companion.

I was always scared of what people thought to me or how I looked. How is the weather for you to go and places in case I was bullied etc too. 

I was also ill as a child with health issued so I often took time off school. Whenever I would go back into school I would always have panic attacks worried what other people were thinking or saying. This affected me even in adult hood, I would have to turn down jobs I applied for and got as I was always convinced I would not fit in, I was not good enough or people with hate me.

My mental health has ruined my life. Although I completed school, I could have done a lot better on my exams but I panicked and I stopped revising. I also didn't go on to university because I panicked and thought I was not good enough.  I always felt like I would fail at everything

It turned out I had anxiety and depression. I did not know this until my mid 30s.

At 22 I was admitted to a mental health ward for suicide attempts and acting bizarre. In hospital was probably the first time I received help, was given medication and therapy. When I was discharged I completely lost my self again and became homeless. As my mum had moved abroad my dad was the only person to care for me and obviously as he is one of the issues I had growing up it all came back really. I just became this person again, slowly drifting through life.

At 24 I met my girlfriend and moved in with her she has helped me but I am too broken by all the damage so our relationship is hanging by a thread

I'm 26 now and have been doing the same stuff for years. Drinking, making bad decisions, self harm, suicide attempts, running away from home.

Last week however I made the decision to self refer myself to a mental health support charity, I've also been tracking my emotions daily and writing things down that trigger me. I decided enoughs enough and I want to be happy finally after 18 years. I think I finally deserve to be happy and let the past go.",HisLoba97,1ckivpa

Few suggestion. 

Start journaling - I know everyone suggest this, but believe me its a game changer, I also do not do it on daily basis, but when my emotions are extreme i do write it in my email, and often after 6 month or a year try to read what was happening with me a year ago. 

I also write what are the reasons for my anxiety and depression as per my self. I try to write every possible details whats happening at this current moment in my life. 

about my relations, job, debt, health, feeling, goal, etc 

  
Acceptance - accept the life and anxiety/depression as a part of life and there is no shame in it. its okay, every one have a journey and its yours. Have positive hopes and beliefs. 

  
Read books - Try reading spritual books, based on your religion you can pick, otherwise try reading Bhagwat Geeta.

I don't remember much from my childhood right up until my mid to late 20s. 

 According to my sister and mum, I was an absolute nightmare to deal with.  I was reckless as hell, alcohol was my go-to for a long time.

 I used my body to give to anyone, didn't give a shit who it was.  I was sexually assaulted by more than one person.  It first happened when I was 18, then when I was 19.  The second time around, I got pregnant, and I had an abortion.  

Alcohol became even more of a coping mechanism, and so did food.  I still thought I wasn't deserving of anyone, so I gave my body to anyone who was willing to date me.  Went through way too many relationships.  

Found someone and dated them for about six years. That was my longest relationship, and they taught me a lot about myself.  That I'm capable and independent and don't need anyone.  

I got therapy and learned I had disassociative disorder, which is why I don't remember things because it was traumatic, and that led to all that shit.

At the age of 30, I decided to stay single for a while, which turned into five years.  When I turned 35, I met the man of my dreams, and we've been together nearly two years and plan on getting married.

 I've also never worked.  My mental health wouldn't cope at the time, but now I feel ready to get out there.  It isn't easy, and I'm waiting for someone to accept the fact that I haven't worked for so long.

It's heartbreaking to think about all the experiences and moments that may have been overshadowed by mental illness. Feeling alone in your struggles, despite knowing that others share similar experiences, is a testament to the isolating nature of depression.



It's important to acknowledge the immense strength it takes to continue trying, despite the obstacles that depression presents. Every day you endure is a testament to your resilience. While it's understandable to mourn the time lost to mental illness, it's also important to recognize the growth and strength that can come from overcoming such adversity.

I started experiencing my first mental health symptoms (I have autism as well but I count that as more a neurological disorder vs a mental health issue) when I was 12, which were symptoms of depression/suicidal thoughts. I started experiencing really bad anxiety when I was 15 after being assaulted.

I thought my bipolar 2 symptoms were starting to show at age 18, but some of my family says they started seeing the symptoms of Bipolar 2 at 14. 

I finally got on Abilify and Effexor when I was either 19 or 20, which has helped my mood SIGNIFICANTLY. The biggest change was that I don’t get nearly as angry as quickly as I used to. I still have mood drops, episodes of mania, crying spells,
impulsive thoughts, but none are as severe as it used to be.

It literally goes unnoticed and laziness/shyness, etc., is the blame word). 


So, my life followed to the LETTER of undiagnosed inattentive adhd: job hopping after short term employment, blasting through paychecks, little to no savings (no way I'll retire), low wage, 1000000000 projects strongly desired and now sitting around barely or not at all touched, severe executive dysfunction, severe procrastination, severe time blindness (it's either 'right now' or 'not right now', revenge sleep procrastination (I put all my time into work, family and have little free time so I stay up way past bedtime to get the me-time I deserve), can't stay focused on anything even if it's super vital/will better my life in all ways, I can easily do All The Things (nothing gets done), tomorrow I'll change and do xyz for real this time (hahaha nope), And so on and so on.

335,"Let me put it this way:

Many chronically and largely pharmaceutically untreatably depressed and/or anxiety-ridden people won’t miss this world. It’s not that they \[we\] necessarily want to die per se; rather, it’s a strong longing for one's pointless corporeal suffering to end. 

Thus, the greatest gift life offers such souls is that someday they get to die. Perhaps worsening matters is when suicide is simply not an option, meaning there’s little hope of receiving an early reprieve from their literal life sentence.

Being reincarnated could/would be hell for people like me — the repetition of mostly unhappiness. Zen Buddhism even teaches that life is suffering or hardship interspersed with genuine happiness. 

Ergo, to quote passages of a poem:

*I awoke from another very bad dream, a reincarnation nightmare / where having thankfully died I’m still bullied towards rebirth back into human form / despite my pleas I be allowed to rest in permanent peace. // ...* 

*... // Each second that passes I should not have to repeat and suffer again. / I cry out ‘give me a real purpose and it’s not enough simply to live / nor that it’s a beautiful sunny day with colorful fragrant flowers!’ //* 

*I’m tormented hourly by my desire for both contentedness and emotional, material and creative gain / that are unattainable yet ultimately matter naught. My own mind brutalizes me like it has / a sadistic mind of its own. I must have a progressive reason for this harsh endurance! //* 

*Could there be people who immensely suffer yet convince themselves they sincerely want to live when in fact/ they don’t want to die, so greatly they fear Death’s unknown? //*

*No one should ever have to repeat and suffer again a single second that passes. //*

*Nay, I will engage and embrace the dying of my blight!*",Professional_Mud_316,1ckivpa

1. **Four things you can physically feel:** Maybe the texture of your clothing, the breeze on your skin, the chair under you, or the ground beneath your feet.
2. **Three things you can hear:** Close your eyes and tune in to sounds outside the room, inside the room, or even your own breathing.
3. **Two things you can smell:** If you can’t immediately smell anything, walk to find a scent or recall your two favorite smells.

387,"I don't think that more medication will help. You have to accept your past, I just completed reading the book, Man's search for meaning. I think you should read it. I'm in a similar boat but I have come to understand that we really need a meaning to live a happy life. We can create our own meanings, there's no one meaning to life.

If the people in concentration camps can find meaning in their sufferings and live through it, so can we. You asked how are you supposed to do hardwork when you don't have a will to live. I don't exactly know the context but if you work hard for something you don't even like or enjoy then it'll be futile, you'll hate it. 

Victor Frankel said that in the current era, we have the means to live but nothing to live for. We have so much time and boredom creates this void which results in despair. Don't try to find happiness, find things that can make you happy and it doesn't necessarily have to be a job or something. 

I have nothing, I don't like my job but I have to do it. I don't have hobbies, no real connections anymore.

you would rather have people remain ignorant and less able to manage their healthcare? 

Theres a class of medications (antipsychotics) that keep causing akathesia or tardiv dyskinesia with me. I've tried 7 of them over the years, even the super new ones.

Ive experienced side effects from medications that I only found out was a thing from that medication because of talking to others.

Without others discussing the 'high' feeling that pregabalin causes I would have not been able to recognize it and recognize that that feeling causes people to eat and therefor gain weight from the med.

The rest of the 7 will still deal with difficult times, stress, depression, anxiety. The difference is they are able to deal with these situations and emotions in a healthy way, and their symptoms don’t meet clinical thresholds for a mental health condition. 

People over pathologise nowadays. Younger people especially experiencing normal human emotions such as sadness or stress jump to thinking they **must** be mentally ill. The growing tendency to pathologise normal human behaviour and emotions increasingly leads to the belief that people *without* MH issues are somewhat rare. But no, they’re the majority. The silent one, too, as you won’t run into non mentally ill folk if you’re accessing services for your mental illness. 

Everyone has stuff to deal with. It’s about how you deal with it, if you can deal with it, how distressed you get when dealing with it, if what you’re dealing with wouldn’t be a problem for the mentally healthy… etc. Those 7 of 8 people are able to deal with adversity, low mood, stress, anxiety effectively, without the impairment of any illness that would otherwise make those emotions/situations really difficult to handle.",radpiglet,175bv92

3. Most people have the resilience to overcome trauma/ hurdles and move on from it.
4. People who develop mental disorders ( for example - PTSD after witnessing a horrific crime) will need therapy and treatment:
5. There are wonderful psychiatric drugs and other options available these days. One has to see the past the social stigma and treat mental illness like any other physical illness.

I'd also like to add that I meditate and pray periodically. My view of life is contentment over happiness, over materialism. 

I am well connected and have positive relations with my religious and social communities. [Other Harvard studies indicate that having and maintaining good positive relationships with people is another outlet for long life happiness as well].

I have a half dozen younger brothers and sisters raised in a religiously conservative loving home with no extremism. Parents allowed us to exercise free moral agency and do our own thing without fear of reprisal or abuse of any kind. 

I am currently undergoing a divorce with two children, I am not a proponent of the divorce at all and wish to go to couples therapy (obviously, that's not what's happening).

Healthy coping mechanisms when you're struggling overwhelmed.  Breathing exercises and focusing on your five senses to ""ground"" you when you are stressed/overwhelmed.  Positive activity scheduling when you're down with something you used to do that made you happy.   Using your supports to help when needed. 

Recognizing when things are getting heated with the person you're interacting with.  Come back after you've chilled out with an open mind.  Come with the problem and some solutions and try not to get defensive.  Recognizing when you're wrong and being able to listen to the other side.   Making amends and finding a way forward...

123,"I was referencing *my* experiences as an adult in an adult psychiatric ward with 18-20 year olds. The pattern fostered by CAMHS in the UK is primarily to blame, and certainly doesn’t do anything to help the way its service users over-pathologise. Rather, they do little to discourage this, instead giving them lifelong “personality disorder” labels and keeping them detained for years. 

My experiences are my truth. It’s not prejudiced to give my opinion based on my own lived experience. At no point did I say all young people are in crisis, nor did I imply that sharing lived experience online is inherently negative. I was saying that *whilst I was detained in a psychiatric unit*, these were some of the things I saw, and based on that, I stand firm in my belief that over-pathologising, social media and CAMHS can be extremely detrimental to children and adolescents. CAMHS stands for **children and adolescent mental health service**, which is why I was saying “young people” — as an umbrella term for those who have been under CAMHS, with a focus on the way this service has actively damaged the mental health of many of its service users. In separate comments I’ve made recently, I largely blame CAMHS and the way the system is set up for harming it’s service users (aka, *young people*). 

If you want to “disqualify” my opinion because I used the term “young people” instead of saying “children and adolescents under children and adolescents mental health service”, go for it. My lived experience and the trauma I’ve taken away from it, and the trauma I’ve seen inflicted on others on the ward **including** those who have just entered adult services, doesn’t need qualification. 

Once again, I was focusing on the **negative** ways those transitioning from CAMHS to AMHS (people who are young - 18/19/20) rely on social media, artificial ward environments and over-pathologising. The world isn’t black and white. I’m in my mid 20s and I was that young person at one point. Understand that I used “young people” to refer to a very specific group of service users in the context of UK psychiatric wards. Not “young people” as in griping about their entire generation.",radpiglet,175bv92

It's negativity to its very core and people often want to kill themselves after reading an assessment that makes them sound like some diseased animal that should simply be shot and put out of its misery. 


Jung warned everyone about this. ""Depression"" used to be ""Discouraged"" and let me tell you when it comes to a show of empathy which is what people need to reach for something more than just surviving -- you know, a real human connection -- the word ""Depression"" doesn't build that bridge. But discouraged? That's a word we can all relate to. 


To feel pushed down, kicked, knocked out of the ring. It's harsh but it feels honest, real, to say it like this. You did your best but things happen and you got overwhelmed. Doesn't that feel idk, more compassionate to say than *You're depressed, eat pills for your sick brain*?",MNGrrl,175bv92

I did it, and it took longer, but I had to study all walks of human behavior history, religion, war, and self-help therapy books. But my brother, who goes to therapy, is able to correct some of my wrongs, so that helps a lot. Having to combine all the knowledge into human behavior perspectives is a lot of work to do alone.

142,"I don't mean to downplay the importance of therapy, I think it's extremely important for so many people, but I also think the concept of it makes it so that not everyone needs it too.

This is extremely helpful since you could potentially be extremely deep in ways of thinking that prevent you from ever getting better on your own, needing an outside professional to help give you proper direction and coaching, but in the end it's always you that solves the problem.

So I think a lot of people don't need it just because they are able to solve these problems without guidance.  I'd say those people are mentally fit....but maybe it's more accurate to say mentally talented.

I also think there's a toooon of people out there who are fully convinced they don't need a therapist yet need one more than most people and that that's a huge problem.  Big difference between thinking you don't need one vs actually not needing one for real.",Kaldin_5,175bv92

Trauma is not just emotional blunting. It's much, much more. It's not realizing that being passionate about your work pisses everyone else off because it makes them look bad. It's burning out over and over again being kind to people who not only won't reciprocate, but will take advantage of it, and not recognizing that kindness is not the minimum, civility is. Trauma makes us want to be loved by someone, anyone, so bad that we'll pretend to be an entirely different person just to try to put a stopper in the loneliness. It's a lot of things, and it lives in each of us a little different too. 


What trauma does, and why it's so damn insidious, is force us to play the same game but with extra rules and with more challenge. Which is why everyone says ""Oh they're just lazy!"" or ""try harder"". They're not trying to be jerks, it's just that they, like you, don't realize there's these extra rules and challenges that make something that looks easy, actually really hard. The only kind of person who can help someone else through that and to the other side where they can actually see it in themselves and able to make a different choice, to break the cycle of multi-generational trauma, is to have someone just like them take them under their wing. 


Sympathy is the first condition of reason. Logic and reason, presuppose at their origin, emotion. That's why clinical detachment is so evil and destructive: They actually believe they can be healers without participating in life. They view themselves as something separate, or above human flesh. They ask us to rate our pain, rather than share in it.

>  Those whose are betrayed by people they loved, trusted, or relied on may encounter enormous mental and behavioral health challenges, as they attempt to forge interpersonal connections and cope with life’s many challenges. Relational trauma distorts self-image in unfortunate ways,


This is a bait and switch.  It ""distorted"" your self-image in ""unfortunate"" ways? What kind of euphemistic crap is that? How is *that* showing empathy?  No, you were abused. Facts. Probably by someone in a position of power and authority, like a doctor, or parent, partner, or boss.  Now you feel vulnerable and exposed. Because you *are*. Your self-image didn't go all mutant and grow a third arm, your self-image stayed the same! It's your worldview that shifted, in response to new experiences, ie a significant emotional event. 


> but with intensive therapy and a commitment to healing sufferers can overcome its effects and learn to build more satisfying, sustainable relationships.


What the hell does ""intensive therapy"" or a ""commitment to healing"" mean? This is flowery non-sense language. The intended audience here is clearly not someone who suffers from trauma, but the people who are struggling with the idea of tossing their friend or loved one back into the blender of mental health ""treatment"" because they can't financially afford to wait for the government to deliver some proper social supports. No, sorry, you have to just get another job and keep limping along like the rest -- otherwise we'll send you to a ""treatment"" facility where you'll be threatened with homelessness if you don't lick the boots of the staff and follow their arbitrary rules while the overworked and underpaid workers shovel mental health worksheets at everyone and their ""case manager"" visits them once a week to tell them ""just a few more weeks!"" for the next several months until they've made bank on you, then claim you've ""recovered"" and kick you out so you can repeat the cycle again because you didn't get any support that would actually advance you in life in any way, but while you were there your car probably got towed, your roommates dumped all your stuff somewhere and you lost it, and the government says you can technically work now according to the workers, because you complied with their gas lighting and bullshit, thus demonstrating your capacity to work and that you don't need any help. 


Ta-da, the system works. ""Relational trauma is not an officially recognized mental health disorder, even though many mental health professionals believe it should be (and will be eventually)."" Homosexuality was once officially recognized as a mental health disorder. Then everybody mutinied and that crap stopped. Now they're doing it again. And ""Gay conversion therapy"" is still legal. No, the reason it's not recognized is because it's toxic christian messaging pretending to be ""counseling"" or ""therapy"" because those words lack a specific legal definition. 


The symptoms are real. The patients are real. The social problems are real. It's just the explanation that's complete non-sense, because it's trying to rail someone onto the whole ""you need god dick in your mouth to be a good person.""

> . Critical social determinants that impact on people’s mental health
such as violence, discrimination, poverty, exclusion, isolation, job insecurity or unemployment, lack of
access to housing, social safety nets, and health services, are often overlooked or excluded from mental
health concepts and practice. This leads to an over-diagnosis of human distress and over-reliance on
psychotropic drugs to the detriment of psychosocial interventions – a phenomenon which has been
well documented, particularly in high-income countries (11-13). It also creates a situation where a
person’s mental health is predominantly addressed within health systems, without sufficient interface
with the necessary social services and structures to address the abovementioned determinants.

Until I explained to him that, when I am in an office, I will question every social interaction I have and how other people perceive it/me. It is not something I sit down to do, it just automatically happens in my brain. He seemed genuinely shocked and mentioned: “that is something you should talk to your therapist about.” 

That made me laugh so much, because does he really think that this is not what I already do in therapy? I told him that this is the main thing I discuss with my therapist, but after 35 years of my brain doing this, it’s not a matter of just talking to someone about it once or twice, and then it is better.

1. Yes, my mental health and the stresses of my mind wreak havoc upon my body. Taking my sleep, taking my energy, raising my blood pressure, tightening the muscles in my body to the point I feel someone has been punching me up and down my body. The chronic cycle of insomnia and pain leads to difficulty in life functioning sometimes including trying to maintain a healthy physical activity and a healthy weight. The pain is so debilitating you are some days bedridden towards the end of the day and are subject to the cooking and care of other people who may or may not be supportive of your eating style. You fear what the future holds for your independence if you can't get out of this.

2. Your physical health affects your mental health as you go from doctor to doctor seeing your financial health dwindle in the process.The high blood pressure leads to pain which leads to high blood pressure. Or if you finally get your pressure under control something happens and the cycle starts again. You wonder if you'll ever be strong again. Or pain free again. You get frustrated as family doesn't understand the level of pain, the importance towards reduced stress. You get frustrated because you want to go the gym, to the park, to wherever but it may cost you.... 

3. Your physical health needs as much attention as your mental health. I go to the doctor and I'm met with biases and resistance. You might not have high blood pressure... maybe anxiety- I don't know- I'm not a psych doc- you need to get readings... you need to reduce stress then come back. You're so young... just lose a bit of weight, reduce stress- come back. Fast forward through a couple of doctors and then doctors trying out high bp meds and wow you've had unmanaged high blood pressure going on for two years now. And this doc will begrudgingly put you on meds but ignores your chest pain your shortness of breath-- ""you're young...: doesn't pull out her stethoscope. You mention pain--- ""well, you obviously hold your pain in your body."" Just reduce stress and lose some weight.

Nope. They put on my file that I had a serious diagnoses making me an unreliable source of information.

I’ve had doctors straight up insist they knew what I was feeling and tried to gaslight me into thinking I was wrong. 

They knew they were making me confused and would put words in my mouth. I only realized because as we were talking I was literally writing out what their responses were to my pre-planned script. *(I was worried I’d get in trouble for recording without notifying them, so I just wrote it out lol.)*

I called them out on it and they had the audacity to say, “No you said __. I think you’re misremembering which is why I think you’re autistic and borderline.”  *(Yes, they said it just like that. Randomly tossed in diagnoses that they’re not specialized in on our first appointment.)*

I also wish people knew how shitty mental health hospitals are. They’re not some amazing place. At least not the ones where I am. 

I’ve been traumatized by those places, so now I can’t even be honest to the professionals I should be honest with because of how bad of a place it is.

it's like having a glass that's always full and overflows with every drop it receives. or on the contrary when you have an empty glass and despite how much water you try to put in the glass it never fills.

it's always remaining in a state of tension or agitation about everything even when there is no reason to be agitated. it's taking every inconvenience as the thirteenth reason, it's having all the reasons to be reacting badly but reasons that cannot be shared or understood by others, or sometimes even by yourself.

it's having all kinds of bad memories that float around in your head even in ""peaceful"" moments and that cause tears that you try to repress in every possible way, even the ones that shouldn't be used, ways that work for a short time but in the long run cause more problems than anything else.

I see normal everyday things as stressors (oh did my boss look at me weird?) and catastrophize these into worst case scenarios (They don't like me... I'm going to be fired and end up homeless). Or get a stressor and then- 1. Not sleep 2. Have intrusive thoughts 3. Dwell on the stress for longer than I should... and if it's really bad-- have physical reactions such as high blood pressure, muscle spasms and tension, chronic pain- including pelvic pain, headaches, migraines and more- my body will start to kill itself.

I work on it and get professional help, but all the doctors I've been to don't really care about my physical symptoms or pain because it's solely a mental problem in their eyes.

And this came from a very long period of self-reflection and mental monitoring. 
I think I’ve come to the conclusion - that life has to be taken in bite size pieces. 
We have to get good at doing the basics right, to be able to move on to the bigger stuff. We have to find peace within, to appreciate what’s outside. 

A quick example: I used to be hard on myself for not starting a side hustle. Yet I couldn’t get myself to the gym every day. 
I hated that I couldn’t talk confidently to people, yet I couldn’t even find confidence in remaining silent. 
I wanted a girlfriend or companionship, but I didn’t love myself yet.

There’s a few steps to everything in life, and I think we tend to try jump to the exciting stuff too quickly without getting the fundamentals right.

And it's not so much that the Lips make such happy music. Their songs deal with a lot of death and sadness, but the way they handle that sadness is so much more positive than I ever knew before. 

Michael Franti was another major reckoning with love and happiness. I realized that no matter my mood, no matter how bad my day was, if I listened to Franti, I felt *happy*.

8,"I took this from a comment I made on a post yesterday:

The best thing that has worked for me is honestly accepting my depression and questioning my anxiety.

I have accepted that depression will most likely be part of me for the rest of my life. I will have my bad times but the trick is learning how to deal with the bad times. Knowing that the bad times will pass eventually and I’ll feel okay after them. Like for example I have a hard time showering when I feel these low times but by using wet wipes and a washcloth, it makes me not feel like absolute shit for not being able to shower.

What I mean by questioning my anxiety is questioning those anxious thoughts that run through my head. I have a fear of my disabled mom falling whenever she walks down the stairs. I recently started thinking “I’ll deal with it when or if it happens” and that has surprisingly knocked down the anxiety that comes with the “what if” question. I always thought that ignoring my feelings of anxiety was a bad coping mechanism so I tried to not ignore them. But the social worker I’ve been seeing told me something like “You’re not avoiding those feelings, you’re pushing away the negative feelings that make you feel bad” which makes sense.

The only time breathing exercises work for me is when I’m having a panic attack and I try to calm myself down. In my opinion, the best therapy is the therapy that works for you. Find what works for you.",vero_6321,1bcekxm
9,"Don’t be around people who practice toxic positivity. Enlightenment means being present, not unfettered joy. People who only talk about “positive vibes and good times” are the sheltered hippie version of those assholes who say “thoughts and prayers” after a tragedy. 

I’m not saying be a negative Nancy. But I am saying if you’re sad, give yourself the space to be sad. Your emotions are not trying to make your life harder. They just tell you what your values are and what you will tolerate. Genuinely letting yourself feel how you want to feel will even make the moments when you’re happy feel that much stronger, because you’re genuinely happy, not forcing it. 

Talking to people who have fought overseas in the military, people who have survived sexual assault, people who have gotten betrayed by their families, people who have survived periods of time where they have experienced physical assault, and even Buddhist monks have told me that the secret to genuine happiness is learning how to manage and ride through your negative emotions. Reacting to your reactions. 

When you listen to your emotions rather than ignore the sucky ones, you get to know yourself better, start getting the courage to set boundaries, and then you’ll find yourself around people and in situations where you’ll be happier anyways, because now you know what makes you sad instead of artificially trying to make every situation positive.",dejamoo75,1bcekxm

I was so burnt out at my job last year. High stress, zero appreciation, constantly on edge. And it ran me into one of the worst depressive episodes I'd ever had. Nothing helped. Exercise, changes in medication, meditation, art, therapy every week. I did not come out of that episode until the summer when we had summer break. I could suddenly breathe again.

Running is hard so it takes a lot of willpower to start, but you feel a lot better afterwards and it helps you sleep at night. Walking everyday is also really good for you, my psychiatrist told me that I should walk at least 30 minutes every single day.

NOW, most of the time I’m alone at home, and I don’t want to socialise with anyone. I lost trust in everyone specially my best friends. It made me think (This mainly applies to big cosmopolitan cities) almost everyone these days, are just friends with other people to try to benefit from them somehow. And if there is no benefit, they would leave you to go to the next person, and this is absolutely disgusting. 

So my advice, so you don’t reach to the point of regret. {IF YOU DON’T FEEL LIKE IT, IT’S OKAY TO SAY NO} in other words {If they’re not ashamed to ask you for a favour, don’t be ashamed to say NO}

Most people these days are selfish, and hungry for attention and to use people as much as they can. if you are not tough enough to either stop them or to put a limit, you will not survive. I learnt this the hardest way just three months ago, and I am almost 40 years old. 😔

But I highly suggest that you don’t ignore them completely. Just be kind to them and let them to get to know you more. That would be the best way to ease ur stress. But do trust me on this., Even if you get close to any of them, you will still be the outsider, that just joined recently.

Well, I see myself as one too. This is how I fight... The only thing I do know is that we have to be kind. Please, be kind. Especially when we don't know what's going on.""

I've found it to be personally impactful to flip the concept around on myself and show myself kindness when life or someone else is unkind to me. Because sometimes we are the one who is on our own side, and if we can't be kind to ourselves, then we're only exacerbating the unkindness and suffering of life. So, I'd encourage you if life or your mom or anyone else is unkind, do something kind for yourself.

She is paying for most of the wedding, though I seem to be picking up more and more of the tab as time goes on, so she’s planning most it, but I have to plan the rest, plus her bridal shower, plus find a new house and pack everything and divide our belongings. She’s being a bit of a bridezilla as well. 

So I’m trying to take what I can and giving the rest back to her. If she so kindly gives me a project, like the flowers, I will do what I can, and literally give the rest back to her. When I am overwhelmed by stress I am taking what I can, and giving the rest back to the universe because I don’t need that shit laying around the house clogging up the atmosphere.",GaslightCaravan,1bcekxm

Most people talk about emotions as if they are controlled by our willpower, or about how positive thinking creates positive emotions - but the truth is actually the opposite. When you bludgeon yourself with forced positive thinking and inevitably get frustrated and give up enough times, you eventually learn that you don't have as much control as people would have you believe, and then stop pressuring yourself to reach an impossible goal. 

Your comment explains what should be done instead. I think that mentally healthy people never have to struggle with their thoughts because they obviously don't cause problems for their lives, so they believe that they are in control of their emotions due to a lack of introspection. We don't control our thoughts, they just appear in our consciousness, and they are delivered after our emotions are already processed. What we can do is react to that emotional thought package for the next loop after consciousness has had its turn 3rd down the list. We don't do this by shaping these thoughts we don't have control over; we do it by being more aware of these emotional thought packages and then acting to accommodate the shitty hand some of us who even have to do this have been dealt.",Zoned58,1bcekxm

159,"I see where your coming from but I've been told this multiple times in my life and it's always made me feel invalidated and like my problems don't matter.

Everyone has different levels of what's ""bad"" or ""worse"". My worst could be someone else's best. Something that someone else thinks is the end of the world could be a walk in the park for another person.

For example, I remember a specific time that I tried to talk about my depression and what goes through my head. The person I tried talking to told me that there's someone out there that has it worse than I do. After this, I shut myself off and didn't reach out for help because I then believed that my problems didn't matter because someone out there is suffering more than me. So I ended up suffering in silence and pretending that I was fine when I wasn't. 

Everyone's problems matter, no matter the severity. Yeah, there are people that could be n their death beds, that's obviously awful. But that doesn't mean that someone else's ""less severe"" issue should be dampened. Someone could be on the cusp of doing something they'd regret and no one would know it.

162,"Interesting time that you ask me this, because I just journaled a few pages about love yesterday.

It came from a step BEFORE loving myself. Like I said above, there are a few steps to everything. 

Here’s the just of it: 

Love is one of the few things in this world that can be created within, and given out for free. Truly. You can give love out from a deepness within, all you have to do is make a decision to do so. 

And by love, I mean love in its broadest form possible. Just give it out. To everything. And everyone. Every interaction you have, just fucking love, man. It might sound a little “soft”, or “unmanly”. But I think if you had to meet me you’ll realise I’m quite a masculine guy, I have a large and carved up physique, I’m a boxer, and I carry a lot of respect about me. (Not an ego boost, just providing context)

Here are some examples of how you can implement love in your life, starting small, and over a period of time getting bigger. Again, I’m reminding you that we need to go as broad as possible with the term love: 

- Greeting a stranger and genuinely asking about their day. Be it a cashier, a waiter; the Uber eats guy. Whoever.
- Eating a healthy meal to give your future self some physical confidence
- Telling a friend that you’re genuinely proud of them 
- Picking something up for a stranger if they drop something 
- Placing your hand on a close friends shoulder for no reason in particular
- Loving a moment for what it is, be it an angry moment, a sad moment, or a happy moment. Because the moment is going to exist, regardless of how you feel about it. So just take it in.

To summarise the examples; It means carrying a warmth and love about yourself that everyone can feel and feed off of. 

Man, I have written the above statement about 60 times in my journal. Manifested that shit baby. 

Okay. So now you’re giving out love in any shape or form. We’ve established that love can be created for free. You’re then on to understanding that love, just as it gets created within, gets charged with an electric magnetism that draws in more love. Each time you give it away, it’s almost as though all the mathematics, physics, energies and wolololo’s come together to tip the scale back, and return that love to you. 

And this, my friend, includes the love you have for yourself. You, return it back, to you. 

It’s 1am for me rn and I have boxing in 4 hours so as much as I’d like to go deeper and deeper, I need sleep. 

I truly wish you all the best in your love journey, and life in general.

165,"Sometimes. That's why The Flaming Lips are so great. Their songs aren't always happy. Some (if not most) of them are incredibly sad, but they express that sadness in such a perfectly beautiful way that it helps me to feel better about sadness. 

Like their song ""Do You Realize??"", which reminds you of the fact that ""everyone you know some day will die"", but urges you to make the most of the time you have with the people you love instead of fearing their (or your) inevitable demise. Make the most of it BECAUSE some day it will end. Some people don't like being reminded of the fact that death awaits us all, but I find it highly motivating. 

Another band that has helped me a lot with grieving the loss of romantic relationships is The Magnetic Fields. They have so. many. sad songs about love, but the lyrics helped me to grieve in a productive way, if that makes sense.

Ironically, being in touch with my sadness helped me realize how draining I find mentally healthy people  and their corny ass advice is. How much it made me feel like shit because their advice didn’t work on me. And it has resulted in me just not telling them my thoughts and tuning them out when they give me unsolicited advice on how to be ✨happy ✨. Some of them I just straight up cut out because their toxic positivity was, well, too toxic, and now I’m around people I can comfortably vent to because they let me be negative and sad without judgement, which ended up making me more happy because now I can let that sadness out AND now have an awesome support system.

I think I should make clear though that as Jordan Peterson says, we should still be dangerous. So having a masculine side to yourself is just as important as having a loving side. Yin and yang. 

I’ve been researching the topic of the balance between masculine and feminine energy, and I suppose it applies here. I’m trying to put it into a digestible format for my own content, and my own understanding.

187,"Just personal experience:

I like to go to the sauna and in there I do a few of these:

- Body scan: just imagining what my toes feel like, then foot, then leg etc over your entire body. Your thoughts will start to wander and get distracted and that constantly happens to me and that’s fine. I’ve heard people talk about when they get distracted by thoughts, having a box that you can put all those thoughts in and closing the lid, “I don’t want to think about that right now, you can go in there”. It will keep happening but some days more than others. Sometimes if I’m really consistent and feeling really good for long stretches of time I can clear my mind for minutes, but most of the time the distracting thoughts are more persistent.

- Just letting thoughts flow: letting my brain think about what ever it wants, all the deepest darkest stupid thoughts just flow and being non- judgmental of them. 

- Look in into the darkness of my eyelids: sort of trying to just look into the nothingness. I’ve had experiences where I’ll sort of see visuals, then sometimes slip into a dream like state. Rarely has happened to me but was wonderful the times it had. 

Don’t beat yourself up over how “good” you are doing it, just bit by bit keep coming back to try and you’ll start to see what works for you. You will notice the difference in your clarity and feelings.

I notice that if I’m living a more holistically healthier lifestyle the more I get out of meditation. The less I drink, the less I smoke, the less sugar I eat/ unhealthy food, the better I sleep, the clearer my mind is and the deeper I can go with mediation.",MrRaddd,1bcekxm

Another way to start is to go in person to a yoga studio that has a “yin” or “restorative” class.  This is very comfortable poses laying down using lots cushions that the yoga teacher will provide and help you set up.  I think starting here helps cause the philosophy one needs to sit in a rigid way really gatekeeps the whole experience to those who are able bodied.

Also subtle commentary on our fucked up classist-stereotypes of mental illness (a homeless man screaming on the street vs a semi functional schizophrenic girl at a craft store). A very real and very empathetic look at just how scary it is for someone living with a mental illness can be, and how unwelcoming and isolating our society has become.",prettyxxreckless,17m90ga

for movies, inside llewyn davis deals with a musician who clearly is struggling with depression about his career and the loss of his singing partner (one of my favorite movies.) the devil and daniel johnston is a documentary about one of my favorite singer/songwriters and his battle with bipolar disorder. synedoche, new york deals with lots of themes about the meaning of life, extenstialism, and mortality following a character who can be interpreted as depression-coded (also one of my favorite movies).",Awkwardly-Geeky,17m90ga

Sybil is about DID.

Enough- Domestic Violence (theres a DSM code for it)

Shutter Island- Schizophrenia and Paranoid Personality Disorder

A Beautiful Mind- Paranoia and Schizophrenia

Analyze This/ Analyze That- Panic disorder, PTSD, Survivors guilt, stockholm.syndrome

Boston Legal- Mad Cow Disease/ Alzheimers/ Narcissistic Personality disorder/ Alcoholism/ Substance Abuse/  Gender dysmorphia- wide range of issues in this show

Bones- ASPD, Grief, Adoption, Cannibalism, stalking, NDEs, theres just wide range of topics addressed on this show

Criminal Minds - this show covers a LOT of types of  homicidal people with a wide range of mental disorders, along with predatory grooming, stalking, family annihilators etc. It talks about the mentality of their ""unsubs."" 

The Green Mile with Tom Hanks- ASPD, NPD, child predatory grooming, altruism, prison psychology, racism, torture

Human Trafficking, with Donald Sutherland and Mira Sorvino- EXCELLENT Television Miniseries that deals a lot with ASPD people with NPD traits, but is mostly giving a victim's viewpoint. Pedophilia, rape, suicide, murder, STDs, drug use- its about exploitation mostly of poor women and girls. 

Basketball Diaries, starring Leonardo Dicaprio- Deals primarily with addiction

KIDS- This is an older movie I think from the early 90s, but a damn good one, dealing primarily with adolescent level psychopathy, aka conduct disorder. Rape, drugs, alcohol, HIV, its mostly just a movie about young hoodrats. 

The Platform- Torture, Prison, psychological and physical warfare/ dystopian/ NPD/ASPD/ survival

Dirty Dancing- Abortion, Classism, Ableism, Child Neglect, infidelity, grief, medical malpractice, sibling rivalry, fear of heights

Titanic- Narcissism, Domestic Violence, depression, suicide, classism, oppression

Shrek- body dysmorphia, beastiality, narcissism, paranoia, low self esteem

Indiana Jones and the temple of doom- Mostly phobias,.but also deals with exploitation, trafficking, cultism, child labor, and NOT TOUCHING ANYTHING lol

Theres also a trilogy I think its Marvel, and I believe its called Unbreakable, Mr Glass, and some other one, it's called Split, but theres DID, narcissism, schizophrenia, body dysmorphia, all sorts of exhaustive mental illnesses in that one. 

What Dreams May Come, is with Robin Williams, and its mostly about the afterlife. Its got themes of suicide, death, depression, delusions, isolation, child loss, lots of grief, but its a REALLY good movie with lots of joy somehow woven into it. 

10 Cloverfield lane, is a great movie about paranoia, schizophrenia, ASPD traits, and I think it has some stockholm syndrome in it.",YayGilly,17m90ga

Melancholia-portrays depression in a literal sense but there's lots of imagery and symbolism as well. I do like to add a disclaimer when I recommend this movie though: if you struggle with depression yourself, make sure you are in a more stable place before watching. I definitely have to be in a good place mentally to watch.

Bonus: this movie isn't about mental illness necessarily, but about social psychology concepts that are extremely interesting. It's called The Stanford Prison Experiment. It's based on real events that occurred in 1971 when the field didn't enforce the strict ethical standards they do today on research experiments. I majored in psychology and remember learning about the experiment in one of my classes and being fascinated. The movie was intense and lived up to my expectations.",Sensitive_Pepper341,17m90ga

As someone who was suicidal in the past and was hospitalized for it seven years ago, that scene just hit me so hard right into my soul and easily stands among the most relatable moments in the entire thing. My own family didn't understand my pain and only got angry and yelled at me for it when I tried to end my own life, and the way he just so perfectly captures not only the utter pain of depression but the complete lack of empathy from the society that we live in toward people like me who are suffering from it is just so perfectly conveyed in such a brilliant and devastating moment.

It's like that at the beginning for a reason!!! It gradually gets more real, with the tone of the show reflecting the extreme ups and downs of her emotional disregulation, general mental state, and her own perspective of the severity of things. There's lots of soft comedy elements but just about every choice they made in the direction and production of every scene has a purpose relevant to portraying the course of her mental health. It's cheesy at times, especially at first, because she never learned to handle emotions as a child so there's elements of a childlike mind; she's a theater girl and drawn to the dramatic; she rides overly optimistic emotional highs and denial. But there are deeper, realer, darker, raw moments as well.

Any amount of self harm ""counts"". 


I've been doing great, mostly clean for years, but I sometimes find myself having intrusive thoughts like ""just a little cut/burn/punch/whatever"" when I'm trying to deal with something. The thing is, the fact that it's ""small"" doesn't matter, it'll still be enough to bring back the addiction, or at least to have it in my mind as an ""available coping mechanism"" again, and I don't want that to happen. I don't want to go back to that.

ETA: Also at the beginning of our (now 10 year) relationship, my partner told me that it doesn't matter if I relapse (I was very ashamed every time) but made me promise to tell him every time it happened. So I did, it was my rule. Now I tell him every time I feel bad/good/scared/etc. He set a base of mutual trust and communication since the start. He does the same with me. We support each other

often we get stuck in loops of rumination for the actions or inactions we did in the past. we end up in a worse situation now because of what we did when we were desperate for even a little sliver of dopamine. it’s important that we catch ourselves and rethink our decisions so that our future self wouldn’t have to go through worse.

**That being said** ... The whole ""not in control"" thing is something people have been saying ever since I can remember and it only comes from a lack of understanding. There are very few drugs that make you lose control and they would be psychedelics and deliriants in high doses, and also alcohol. If you mean controlling the way you feel, well, no one controls that on their own. In fact, people use drugs and alcohol *precisely* to gain some control over their feelings, same with SH, bad eating habits, other addictions, etc. No one uses normal drugs and goes into a fugue state lol.

Anyway, the only reason I say this is because one day you might feel like trying some weed and you really shouldn't be scared of it. It's a good thing to not try it, but weed has been my greatest anti-depressant, stress reliever, boredom cure, and medicine for the last 20 years, and I'd hate for someone to miss out on its medicinal and therapeutic properties simply because they thought they'd lose control lol.

No, you just have a serotonin problem, friend. Makes me almost feel stupid when suddenly I don't want to die and food tastes good, just because I forgot and later didn't want to swallow a few pills.

Just a reminder your brain can lie to you: I had a package for pick up at my apartment's office but I couldn't get myself to leave my apartment for at least 2 weeks so they sent the package back to sender. After they called to remind me a day after it arrived, my anxiety got the best of me and I knew that the people at the office were going to judge me, and think I'm an animal abuser (it was cat food), and do an inspection of my apartment and realize I'm bad at cleaning and evict me then I'm homeless and on the streets, then I can't even keep my cats and then--

  
Well I bit the bullet and went over today. Honestly I'd forgotten about these crazy anxiety thoughts. If anything, the front desk at the office seemed to be scared of me getting angry for them not keeping my package for 2 weeks. I laughed and assured them, no, I TOTALLY get it!

The reason I don't do weed, besides the addiction part (even if you don't get physically dependant on weed, but I already explained how I react to things), is that I have sensory processing issues.

6,"diagnosed APD/NPD... understanding the underlying causes for why i am the way i am and understanding that my perception of reality is skewed has been helpful. for instance, ive been in a very loving and healthy relationship for two years now and dont really see ""the inevitable end"" ive always been waiting for in relationships anywhere in sight.

she knows about my triggers, my delusions  and lets me be dramatic and emotionally volatile ... because she knows even if i dont see my own bullshit in the moment, i will surely acknowledge it later once my narcissistic rage has passed. im very lucky

but i am high intelligence and relatively high functioning, for an APD/NPD. most apds for instance are low intelligence and will never have much self awareness, and most NPDs will never accept or understand that the constant chaos in their lives and relationships are due to their own self-concern and emotional volatility.

so, i am fortunate to have some self awareness. however, i likely never would have gotten to this point of acceptance if it werent for a series of catastrophic consequences in my life. ive had some serious legal problems, very very serious relationship problems, have lost so many people, destroyed so many valuable relationships.. my poor decisions have resulted in others lives being very negatively affected.

On another note, I know only one person with NPD who actually has great relationships with people. He works very hard to stay self aware and to trust himself to behave according to his values rather than his natural impulses. He meditates a lot and goes to therapy fairly regularly.

17,"1. What was your experience with people in the past? Did you have many broken relationships and friendships?

(Elaboration: Because to me I find it interesting that with most narcissists it seems to be a thing that they pretty much leave a trail of enemies behind and never realize that their behavior/thinking might be a reason for many of the issues.)

2. Do you feel like you get disappointed and let down a lot?

(Elaboration: Because again, a big thing I noticed is that they seem to have pretty high/unreasonable expectations towards others, one could say they only seem to take and never give, but their perception seems to be that it's the other way around.

3. Do you feel like people never understand you in arguments? And do you get accused a lot of things (from different people, not just one) that you don't agree you did, or that you think were justified?

4. Would you say you are generally self-aware and able to take accountability? If so, do you think others would agree with that image of yourself?

18,"What do you think about the new wave of NPD awareness online? I know this may be a confusing question 

I'm, shamefully, on tiktok a lot and follow a few people with NPD. One of whom is mostly focused on informing people without NPD about how to be safe from narcissists and how to deal with narcissists.

On the other hand, there's a group of people who consider certain stigmas (if they are stigmas) offensive. For instance, I've seen quite a few posts blow up about how ""narcissistic abuse is an albiest term because because you cannot blame a personality disorder for abuse."" I know this is a niche, chronically online debate but I still find interest in it.

 Although I tried to open my mind to the idea of recognizing that people with NPD shouldn't be pigeon-holed as abusers, I struggle with this as someone who was a victim to ""narcissistic abuse."" I am traumatized by a narcissist and still struggle with PTSD because of it. Likewise, I've had multiple childhood friends with narcissistic parents who absolutely fucked them up down the line. Also ""narcissistic abuse"" seems like a very appropriate label to define specific tactics and patterns of abuse, compared to other types of abuse with other unique patters. 

When it comes to disorders that are taboo, as you say, such as ASPD and NPD, where the sufferer often has victims, would you consider it stigmatizing for these disorders to be associated with abusers?",AdvertisingFew450,vih8la

1) This might be a little sensitive so I understand if you don't want to answer, but do you actually take any pleasure from causing emotional pain? I have been exposed to NPD before and the reasons why the person was emotionally abusive weren't quite clear to me. The best reason I can think of is maybe revenge, but I couldn't see any clear logic there. 

2) How well are you able to ""read"" other people's emotions? 

3) How would you describe love? 

4) Do you understand why people have boundaries, such as not wanting to share details of intimate life etc? I found it very hard to explain to someone with NPD why I won't tell about a messy break-up.  My best explanation would be that they kept insisting just out of curiosity, I don't really see another reason.

  You are good enough. You are strong enough. You are enough.

  We forget too easily that learning to cope with mental health is not easy. It's complicated and messy, and the things that work one day won't always work the next. We all have days where we feel like normal people, and days where we lash out and get angry because we just can't hold in all this pain anymore. 

  Seeing a therapist is the healthiest thing a person can do. Our mental health can crash so easily based on some of the most arbitrary things, but it is important to never forget that you sought help, you have a treatment plan, you have what it takes to make this illness submit to your will. The illness isn't a living thing, of course, but if it was, it would be trying to force you to submit to it. 

  And I do not hold to that. 

  Mental illness is not something we ever ""Get better"" from. But we can mitigate the negative effects of our symptoms enough to let us breathe and feel like people again. I know its hard, but please don't forget that you've already made an incredible journey simply by going to a therapist.

3) Do you think it's common for people with NPD to play the victim? And how they still keep their selfesteem high in that kind of play?

I have encountered some people with NPD who seemed to twist their ""victimisation"" into some kind of superiority. 

One of them was diagnosed and even hospitalized many times - because he was so ""miserable"" and he would often announce suicide plans. And the only thing he got out of his treatment was ""they are in wrong, they don't know what's going on with me, it's something beyond standard DSM or ICD, they can't help me"". From my point of view it was like he wanted to suffer and show his incurable suffering because it made him unique.

It's impossible for me to understand how could they possibly live in two parrarel worlds: one where they are constantly on the bottom and complaining and showing lacks and unfortune of every kind and the other where they feel good about themselves thanks to the effects of that play?

Some of them. They’re all aware, I’ve been fairly transparent about it with my close friends and family since I got diagnosed. (Given my behavior it wasn’t exactly shocking to them.) Some of them are accepting, supportive, and understanding. Others chose to distance themselves, which I completely understand. 

I actually advise that people who interact with me regularly set boundaries with me, and be very firm with me when I break them. Being firm but remaining level-headed is the easiest way to let me know that I fucked up. Getting mad at me (although a fair response) will just kick my ego into overdrive and I’ll get extra defensive, which doesn’t do anyone any favors.",MisterPhobia,vih8la

I’m not 100% what you’re asking me, but, I am aware that I am lying. However, once I’ve convinced someone of a lie it sorta becomes the truth in my head even though I do know that it’s not, if that makes any sense. I don’t truly believe that I am a victim or superior when I think rationally, but that perception of myself will always be present I think. 

It’s incredibly common for someone with NPD to play the victim. Being a victim is actually a big ego boost for them. If you’re perceived as a victim, people are easier to manipulate. You also look better than the people who you’ve deemed to have wronged you, even though you really aren’t. It’s both to keep themselves on top and keep the others as far beneath them as possible.

If they refuse help, refuse to believe they’re in the wrong, etc, after this long, I’m not all that sure what you can do.

I’m in an out of therapy as I feel I need to be, or sometimes at the request of those close to me.

123,"I used to think I have this. But I think it’s part of the human experience, we suffer a lot of internal doubt and insecurities or toxic behaviors. As we grow and experience life we become aware of it. We either change in constructive ways, stay the same, or cope with it negatively. Empathy and self awareness and being mindful of negative thought processes is essential to becoming a grounded adult. It takes a lot of work honestly. Some people are put in positions where they develop empathy and responsibility— caring for others or family. Your self aware… that’s big. It may take you more work than others but it’s something that can be managed. I’m only writing because I’m a late bloomer in life and was very selfish growing up until the pandemic happened and faced reality —- life is hard and having difficult responsibilities puts things in perspective.
Some people are just way way harder on themselves with shame and guilt —- it’s important to practice reframing, forgiveness, and introspection (meditation and exercise tend to help with intrusive thoughts for me)
I started reading more on myself, selfishness, and life satisfaction in general when I went into a deep depression. “Happiness” by Matthieu Ricard is a powerful book.

I was very close with a male friend of mine, and we would be cool for about two weeks and then suddenly, out of nowhere, he would become very, very underhanded and do what you described, or start asking if I could get him this or that (he had money and lived very luxuriously) and then a few days later, he would calculatingly explode on me about something that I had no idea I was doing or telling me that I was behaving in a certain way that he found disrespectful, that I also was unaware of, and in order to fix the issue that he had with me, I had to compensate materially or monetarily in some way for it, but he wouldn’t necessarily come out and say that, but it always ended up being resolved (for that week or month at least) by doing that until it happened again. I thought he really was broke until he accidentally let it slip as to how much money he really had. If I addressed the his behavior, it was always thrown back at me in some way, that I was the problem, and if I couldn’t see that, then I was a “bad friend” after “all he had done for me,” which was basically just coming over when he ordered me to, to watch the real housewives of Beverly Hills, and listen to him complain about his other poor relationships with others, again, all of which were *their* fault. He had convinced anyone he was remotely close with to give him money, material goods, etc, when he asked it of them. If they didn’t, or I didn’t, it suddenly became that they were using *him*.

An easy way to distinguish between guilt and shame is like this:

Guilt happens when we break other peoples rules; societies rules, parents rules, etc. Regardless of how we feel about the act itself, if we feel like we have overstepped with someone or something we care about, we feel guilty.

Shame happens when we break our own rules; when we act against our authentic self. It means that a deeper part of us is unhappy about how we have acted as we have not acted ‘ourselves’.

So if you are recognising shame, it means that you are aware (at some level) that you acting against your own rules and values.

Many people will disagree with me by saying that it's not just software but also bad hardware, due to genes or environment. I agree, but you can reprogram your software to account for flawed hardware. Note also that bad software can cause negative effects in the hardware.

You’re looking at yourself and people as ‘programs’ and stating they just need to change their hardware/programming to fix themselves. Like we are robots. Biological creatures are a lot more complicated than a machine. It’s not just flawed programming or hardware. You don’t just get to replace it. Yes you can learn coping mechanism and the proper ways to think. You can redirect yourself to better thinking. A lot of people require medication to help. Most of which will be on their whole lives. Like a schizophrenic cannot just learn better ways to manage their illness. They need medication. You don’t give a machine medication. You just replace the parts. Actually hardware can go completely bad also. It can be unfixable. To compare us with machines you must consider this as well. When your hardware and programs need upgrading you replace parts altogether. So you can’t really just replace parts of people. 

The scientific approach is medication and therapy with lifestyle changes. Not reprogramming. There are still many things science cannot explain about the human brain. Tell a schizophrenic they can reprogram their brain and they’ll say so can others and panic that their illness is someone messing with their software. Actually pretty sure I’ve heard this type of talk from someone in psychosis. This is a physical mental illness. You cannot reprogram yourself out of cancer or diabetes. It’s the same with mental illness. I doubt you will change your mind despite you preaching to others that they’re just incapable of opening up to other possibilities. Referring to the human brain like a computer is an analogy not mean to be taken so literally. It’s not that simple.

This is coming from someone that has tried for years to convince themselves they don’t need medication and could get away with just coping on their own. I would be fine for a while and back and forth with stable and not. Now I’m on the right medication and able to change my thought process with it to be stable. I got to therapy as well but without the proper medication it wasn’t so helpful. I’ve got the variety of mental illnesses.

Therefore, what goes on during a session is meant to bring up the stuff that is unpleasant to you and eliminate them. You do that by yourself with the assistance of the professional. Your body, due to the trauma, is hypersensitive to anything that even might resemble an attack. It is thus inevitable that during a session there will be moments that your body will recognise as an attack. Before going to therapy, do your best in acknowledging such fact and know that it is true for you, you will feel attacked. However, where you are going is not a hostile environment, it is a place made to help you, to guide you :) There are no enemies there, not at all :) So when you feel attacked there, try your best to see it as just your body's reaction and not as what is in fact true :) People there do not want to hurt you, they want to help you. Please, try to see it from that perspective. The talk you will have with a therapist might sometimes be unpleasant and your body will react accordingly but you will be in a place that is not hostile.

If you have good mental health or minor mental health struggles/illnesses, sure “believe it to achieve it” might work. It’s not that simple for people with severe mental illness. 

OP stated they have Autism, PTSD, OCD, Bipolar. As well as childhood trauma and repeated negative and harmful experiences from medical professionals. There are plenty of mental health professionals who can handle and treat the things that OP is struggling with, who understand that certain mental illnesses/neurodevelopmental disorders (such as autism) cause a huge impairment in the ability to regulate emotions. Those skills can be learned, but you can’t expect someone with a history like OP to be able to just do that without learning the skills in therapy first. 

Unfortunately they said that they are not employed so do not have insurance that most providers accept, which makes it even more difficult to get treatment. A little compassion and empathy can go a long way though. OP is clearly trying despite many difficult hurdles in their way and that is extremely commendable.

82,"I understand how you feel. I’m dealing with my own situation in life so I’m not surprised if something is confusing. Helps if you read slowly cause I’m all over the place I’ll admit I envy you for having the opportunity to actually get a mental health console. So I can’t stress enough do the other persons advice about writing down what you want to have the person help you with. I’m having no choice but deal with things alone while being made fun of and ridiculed for anything I care about.

I’ll do my best to explain it just want to give you a heads up I haven’t had much positive social interaction and it takes a toll. Especially when it’s not in person conversation. Explaining things by text is usually boring.

Basically pick that up at the door is a phrase I learned to adhere by when life was normal. 

I’m going to use the situation of taking inventory  of boxes that are all exactly the same. Each box is one item.

Let’s say for instance you had a disagreement with a co-worker about how the task could be performed both accurately and efficiently. 

The boxes are perfectly stacked on a pallet in 5 layers. Each layer is 5 boxes.

The coworker disrespectfully and stubbornly says to count each box individually.

It’s a perfect stack. You know by experience and would just do simple math.
5 per layer X 5 layers =25 boxes total on the pallet.



Let’s say the coworker just doesn’t listen like  “nope nope nope this is the way it has to be done”

Instead of getting angry at the person and arguing with someone stubborn you know either way it’s 25 boxes and the coworker will realize it once he counts them individually. I taught many coworkers during training and it’s best to assume they don’t know something so try and explain it so they learn. No one should be angry at someone who’s learning something new and they shouldn’t be made fun of either.

You let the person learn the hard way. 

You didn’t carry the anger home or into your next conversation. 

Anger always makes things worse and can end up making something small be perceived as a big deal. 

I learned that from my mom who’s been emotionally abusive my entire life. She always got angry and yells instead of doing the nurturing part of parenting.

As I said I’m 28 and choosing to go into the military. The recruiter said since I’m older and probably more mature I maybe given leadership since majority are fresh out of high school.

I’m soft spoken as a result of what my mom put me through in my childhood. However I can do the really loud whistle. 
First thing I’d do in basic training if I were given leadership is this


*ear ringing whistle* 
“I’m soft spoken since my mother was emotionally abusive and chose to yell just because I didn’t understand and wanted to learn. If I’m ever yelling it’s for a good reason like life or death…..” then go on with what a leader does when their in the moment of gaining trust of others.

Not going to lie, I really needed a mental health professional my self. However I had a family that betrayed the meaning of family. I’m actually someone who has major anger issues but swore when I was a teen I’d do better so I wouldn’t be a reflection of my mom to my children. Thanks to my family I doubt I’ll have the opportunity. So instead of giving up and taking my own life I’m trying to turn to the military in order to salvage something. The worst feeling I’ve grown accustomed to is having no support and being thrown a curve ball. The bad habits I have actually aren’t irreversible I just don’t have a place that makes growth possible.

There is nothing beyond basic licensing requirements for these therapists, so there is nothin to prevent a fresh licensee with no experience from taking on a complex case like mine with absolutely no clue what they are doing, and from what I can tell that is mostly who I am being assigned to.

Psych is virtually impossible to get into, if you do it hardly pays for any prescriptions, Medical doctors always just run a quick blood and urine screen they know insurance won't dispute, and then kick you out the door without any results before you can cut into their margins even further.

I have no income, can't afford an e-bike.

I don't consider inpatient treatment an option for a number of reasons. I don't think I am eligeable because i am not actually a threat to myself or others, but if I was that's the same criteria for involuntary, and the way low income health care is under capitalism (money first, procedure second, patient third if there's anything left), even if I was to go in i am certain that they would just find whatever excuse to keep me as long as the state will pay for to maximize their own profits. If they lock me up against my will I will never stop fighting, which will lead to criminal charges and jail, and I will never stop fighting them either, and I'll never see the light of day again.

In the best case scenario, this would cause me to lose the little work that I do have, and with the low quality care I have been repeatedly subjected to, I am not convinced in the slightest that the care I would receive there would be any better. I don't expect those people to magically be more competent then what I've already been dealing with. One of my last therapists also worked at one of those places and she was a hack so unqualified for problems as serious as mine that she was quite harmful, as most mental health professionals turn out to be.

I have no easy answer for this and for a while I've said this is a very underrated aspect of mental illness.

But it does feel like it's more accepted now but at the same time it's really not. Which makes it very frustrating. It's a more insidious form of stigma than it was in previous generations I suppose. 

If I had to answer: Yes, just tell people. Hiding in plain sight is no way to live. There are exceptions of course. Work being one. People you know are not trustworthy being another.

Long and somewhat blunt response incoming..


I'm a mental health professional, so I feel fully capable of having these types of discussions with people. I have no problem  telling people when they're being unreasonable, intolerant, ill-informed, or whatever...

I have been lucky in life thus far, as I haven't had many traumatic social experiences. If I had more of a rough time in childhood, I might feel differently at this point. In my position, I feel somewhat like it's a duty of mine to do my part in telling people off when their ideas surrounding mental health are skewed. Sometimes it's empowering.

I think if you're comfortable with yourself and handling others in this context, I believe it's important to talk about this stuff. Why? Because of those things you're all talking about here-- because these people will keep stomping all over us until we become the fierce majority. needs to be demystified and destigmatized. Having a diagnosis (or even just  difficulties) needs to stop being seen as weakness and be seen as strength- the ability to know yourself intimately, accept yourself, and work towards becoming a better version of yourself. All the negative stuff surrounding mental health really shouldn't be happening at all. It's not helpful. It has no place in this world, in my opinion. I'll 100% support anyone in this endeavor. I think it's worthwhile and a necessity.

That being said, it's important to ""know your audience,"" so to speak. Know who is safe, who is not. Who might be willing and capable of a change in perspective, and who definitely is not. There's no reason to put yourself in a place where others will behave negatively towards you if you don't have to. Build yourself a support network so you can protect yourself from those who aren't helpful.

What does the brain do with unnecessary or unhelpful connections? It PRUNES THEM. If people won't grow and change for the better with you, I say: prune those people out of your world, for they are unhelpful and unnecessary.

Easier said than done, I know... but I think talking about these things is at least one step in the right direction.


Good luck on your journeys, everyone 💜",bkd4691,1bhwmkq

When I grown older I found out that even if some care what can they really do if I don't want to help myself. In recent times I just come to realize that maybe I should suck it up and move on. So this days I never share anything about myself and just try to mirror the vibe in given social situation. 

I don't know what's right or wrong just sharing my own experience. But I will say I needed to go through the self pity stage and used allot of drugs and acted stupid in social groups, cried allot, had allot of crazy reactions on drugs. But yeah I feel like it comes to a point where I just have to reflect a bit more and maybe don't use so much drugs. For me it was needed, but eventually made it worse and then I had to give up a part of me that was needed in a period of my life. 

I still feel this way, but instead fallen in a depression rather than trying to fit in.

And kids open with their diagnosis or diagnoses (can't spell the plural form of diagnosis sorry) get bullied to the point of depression and self harm/eds/etc. 

That's just the kids. The teachers aren't any better in redneck Missouri. I got told by a teacher in a class discussion that we all have autism and ADHD, it's just that some people have it more than others. 

I feel an enormous amount of fear knowing that I could slip up and be beat up in a fucking bathroom because of my genetically fucked up brain.

I really wish people would stop making fun of people with mental health under the guise of “laughing *with* you not *at* you” even when it’s fucking obvious only one of us is laughing, and it’s not the one with the actual diagnosis -.-

I’m autistic and I’ve had enough bad reactions or ableism in daily situations that I’m selective about who I disclose that fact too. Granted I’m not great at masking so I usually get discriminated against anyways, but some people will be even worse if they know that autism is the reason I seem *off* to them, as if by telling them that I’m autistic I’ve told them that I would like to be bullied or some shit. 

I hope you find a person who isn’t an asshole that pokes fun at an illness they clearly don’t understand (cause schizoaffective is *way* different than schizophrenia and ime is closer to bipolar than schizophrenia. Also for either disorder the negative symptoms are more bothersome for most people than hallucinations or delusions, but people don’t realize that schizophrenic people also have a lot of adhd type symptoms too).

165,"Medium. 

It’s against ADA guidelines in the US to disclose any more than you have to. Honestly your doctor doesn’t even need to disclose they just need to write that you have a disability/illness/whatever and they recommend ‘x’ accommodations and so long as they are reasonable they are to comply. You typically work on reasonable accommodations with your doctor like being seated closer to the restrooms, having access to a refrigerator for chilled medication, etc. It often isn’t reasonable to shift to extremely flexible hours and depending on the place you may not be able to miss a ton of time midday or they may encourage part-time or FMLA at that point. I dont know if that helps in any future disclosure situations but in the US one thing we surprisingly have is extremely strong disability accommodation and disclosure legislation. There are very few cases where you have to actively disclose your issue, to the point you have to sign disclosure agreements for doctors to speak on your case and share info/tests/etc unless it is a major risk to life and/or you’re referred for a specific condition. I had to sign disclosure agreements for my 2 psychiatry offices to speak though and they actually only work for one topic so I just tell both of them what’s up with the other. 

I was a bit more open because I am in a space where I have worked well with HR and even in my worst moments like the loss of my parents, they were so flexible they even let me move teams without an adjustment to my salary just so I could have more flexibility. I’d be gone anywhere else and I hold on to that reality often. I got super lucky I was hired in when it was a small company and they weren’t recognized enough to have a lot of applicants. Now we’ve grown 5X our size and they’ve still honestly worked to avoid that lack of connection - it increases retention rates which are extremely strong, which reduces the time lost getting someone up to speed which can be months, access requirements are another few weeks, etc. Our productivity and coverage is also almost always extremely high and coverage is largely self-governed since we don’t all hate our lives so much.

In the past, I had anorexia nervosa for 18 years-- for the majority of this time I was very, very underweight and this was quite visible. I used to lie about the causation, but I'm fairly certain people knew, and I feel like it strained some relationships. Eventually, I became more honest about it and simply told people if I knew them well enough for it to be reasonable. Things seemed to flow better with honesty in many situations.

Not everyone understands mental illness and as a result it can be risky to tell someone about a disorder you are dealing with-- however, would you really want to be with someone who just wrote you off based on something they did not understand with no further thought? I mean, it seems pretty shallow.

On the other hand, some people do have knowledge of mental health issues, but they're cognizant they don't personally possess the mental energy to deal with a partner actively struggling with such, or they have had bad experiences that make someone seeking treatment not optimal, all the same.

If the goal is mutual respect and understanding, telling them is reasonable. Their response is telling in relation to their own needs and their own capacity to open their minds. If someone disses you because you open up to them about what you're dealing with, they aren't worth your time. If they can't handle it, that's your job to respect their boundaries on that front.

But also just fundamentally, it's hard to feel like I've truly connected with someone who doesn't know about such a substantial part of my life, especially if that was because I felt I couldn't trust that person with it.  Why even bother at that point?

But it's important to note I don't do social friendships: everyone in my life is somebody I care deeply about and trust.  So there's no one I regularly talk to who I wouldn't trust with that information, to still respect me and my privacy.  I also like to make it very clear I'm open to questions because there's so much misinformation out there, and even if they have good information, people experience these disorders in vastly different ways.  When you tell somebody a diagnostic label, they'll generally think the worst.

But yeah, I'd only recommend it in close relationships or if you have to for some legal purpose, like getting accommodations at work or being allowed to have an emotional support animal in your apartment.

I take it 3 times a day but 1-2 times a day is also normal dosing. I was taking it at depression level doses for a while and it beat back a depressive episode quite nicely.


I get why psychs are trying to avoid prescribing anxiety meds like lorazapam and the other Pam's (never ever ever go on clonazapam, it is such bad news). It's because people can easily become dependent and addicted to the stuff.  


At the same time, sometimes it's the only med that's effective and they can be really helpful with panic disorder.

Mental illness certainly shouldn’t be normalized but there are outside factors contributing to an increase in debilitating depression, anxiety and general loneliness in this generation.

7,"Even more unpopular hottake. 

This isn't a post about ""normalized"" or even ""talked about"" mental health. This is a post about mental illness.

Mental Health is about finding evidence based practices, engaging in a dialog regarding treatment, discussing natural supports and their utilization, supporting suicide prevention plans, advocating for social change in society, taking personal accountability for choices, supporting empowerment through encouragement and challenges, growing didactic conversations rather than throwing out basic ass complaints about how other people are ""ruining"" your expirence. 

My ""every five seconds"" fr fr is this sub has kinda fallen off? And most posts are shock related, or looking to elicit a reaction, not engage in discussion about mental HEALTH.

I spend more time in specific subs or on my mental health provider discords because e this sub in particular is kinda full of people who really want to pull off a venting bitch sesh instead of talking about how their plan looks forward to healing. Or threaten suicide, because to the reader we won't know whether or not they completed it. 

Take shots at this or down vote me. I've been lurking and pulling back from here anyway. I'd like to be able to offer people a chance to see that mental health is actually a rough and steep road that can be fun and take time to traverse. I've seen hundreds and hundreds of clients and family members do it for years and years.

107,People tend to forget that this stuff is not solved easily. The truth is it is both a slow process and an instant process at the same time. Once it clicks then people can have juristic differences overnight but it takes time for it to click and it's a very slow process of hard work before you finally get to the point where it clicks and it's fixed seemingly overnight. People who have worked through this forget that all the hard work spent in therapy and life was important. They usually have the thought that they could of learned it sooner and they try to tell other people that they just need to understand a crucial idea and it all will work out (Which is true but not the whole truth). They come up with the idea that maybe people can skip all the hard work and just have it click because someone else explained it to them (which is where they are wrong). From this people can lose empathy and fail to understand where the other person comes from. It's like getting frustrated that a child is having a hard time understanding mathematics but forgetting that they were once that child without that understanding (however in this case it's common that they may never have been in that state of mind to begin with).,Safe-Celebration-220,ytd6lx

113,"Agreed. I noted how we all deal with anxiety in my comment... I never said anxiety comes from different places, but that there are different levels to it. ""Growing up"" is an unhelpful way of looking at it when serious mental health conditions can quite literally be located and witnessed in a brain scan. Would you tell someone with an x-ray of their broken leg to just walk it off?

My contribution here comes from having completed a Master's paper on brain scans and mental disorders last month. I was referring to the research I have read which reveals the significant role of the brain in certain mental disorders. Let me tell you, serious mental disorders do not reveal a happy, ""normal"" looking brain. Yet, there is hope...

I highly recommend watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esPRsT-lmw8). There are incredible developments happening. Cost is a downside right now, but this will slowly change. I would actually argue that identifying the condition is of utmost importance. This allows patients to gain access to newer and better treatments. A little more empathy wouldn't hurt either...

However, I talk mostly about people who say stuff without thinking or for attention. I do feel that everyone has a right to therapy if they feel like they need it, if their life is impacted. We shouldn't minimize people's symptoms either. 

But, I'm saying this from a context with good healthcare and no long waiting lists. A new psychologist can be found in 2 weeks, a new psychiatrist in a month to two months but faster if it's urgent.

118,"Wtf is this about?

Yes, EVERYONE should see a therapist, regardless if they have something or not. 

Just a reminder that a “mild” depressive episode could turn into full depression. 

“Normal everyday problems” could very well turn into depression, anxiety, OCD, etc. 

On top of that, not everyone with depression is suicidal. Just because they dont wanna kill themselves doensnt mean they are keeping it together. Doesn’t mean they are able to fix their problems on their own. 

That’s like saying someone with a broken finger shouldn’t go to the hospital because someone else got a broken leg, when both need treatment. People with no medical issues often go to the doctor to prevent future health issues. People shouldn’t wait for when the worst happens. 

I really wish I got to see a therapist when things weren’t as bad for me. Could’ve prevented a lot of things. Because I waited for so long, my mental health started to go downhill. So stop fucking telling me that I had no right to see a therapist before and prevent this bullshit from happening. 

I sincerely hope you follow what you preach. Please don’t go to the doctor unless you’re literally dying. That’s the only condition you should go to the doctor. Getting a medicine prescription? You don’t need that. There are people who need it more. Getting checkups? You’re wasting the doctor’s time. It also doesn’t matter if you have a broken arm.

A death in someone’s life can absolutely be traumatic to one person and not another.  You have no idea what’s on someone’s shoulders.  

These comments are disgusting.  Just because someone doesn’t meet the “DSM-5 disorder” criteria, or didn’t have the PRIVILEGE or curse to receive one doesn’t mean they aren’t experiencing something as extreme as you.

It is so easy to correct people when they behave this way.

For example I tend to use the word “narcissist” quite freely as all I am trying to do is use the adjective, and not tell a person “hey you have a disorder “ 

Personally it is frustrating to me when people try to ban this word given they are afraid that it’s usage can demonize those with NPD. I believe that it is the reaction people without NPD have to the word , that causes this demonization . While they mean well, those (or at least many of those especially with the help of therapy and treatment) with NPD are keenly aware that they are not defined by their personality disorder.

And I am a believer in the fact that at some point in everyone’s life we act as though we are full of ourselves. Be it as a survival mechanism or if we truly feel that way.

But as for your point about how we shouldn’t pay attention to people like that due to the disdain it might bring… I agree with you that disdain might happen. But again, I think the disdain is often reasonable and understandable because the people conflating low-level infrequent anxiety with diagnosed chronic anxiety by using the same word to describe both (“anxiety”) are causing harm by doing so. It is dangerous to use the same word to describe two quite different things, because as OP points out, it leads to minimization of actual chronic severe conditions, which is something that *should not* be minimized.

So is the solution to this problem to gate-keep certain words? Perhaps not. But I think one solution could be, when people use words like “anxiety”, “depression”, “narcissism”, etc., the people involved in the conversation should ask for clarification rather than assume the person is talking about casual, low-severity anxiety and then proceed to minimize their experience by drawing false equivalencies.",PokyTheTurtle,ytd6lx

Did you watch the linked video?

Fear plays a role to an extent. You are oversimplifying though. This is also the issue raised above. Blaming the person suffering with mental health for not trying hard enough to get better on their own shows you don't really know much about it. 

How long has your life been improved? Has it been a long-term, permanent solution, or do you simply feel okay right now? How were you initially diagnosed? Mental health issues have a habit of recurring if not diagnosed and treated properly.

Brain imaging offers a permanent solution. In the video, I believe it is explained as attempting to diagnose someone blindly without it. This is why brain scans are so important. They reveal exactly what is going on and pave the way for better, more permanent treatment.

In regard to trauma, have you come across EMDR therapy? Again, this involves working with the brain (via eye movement) to reprocess traumatic memories and remove any associated symptoms. I have been through this myself. It removes all intrusive memories of the traumatic incident. It also allows a person to finally get a good night's sleep. Life changing! For me, those intrusive memories/trauma responses have not returned in over five years since treatment even when faced with triggering situations. Amazing stuff!

1,"I’ve struggled with anxiety, depression, ADHD, and OCD since I was a teenager. In addition to the obvious things like going to therapy, considering medication (if necessary), and living a healthy lifestyle, here are 5 simple things that should put you in the best position to take care of your mental health:

1. **Prioritize your social life.** At the end of the day, we are social beings. Socializing with friends, family, and people you love is way more important than work, money, or anything else. This is what keeps you fulfilled.
2. **Reduce your screen time.** Doomscrolling on social media is more than just a time suck. It’s a soul-sucker. Constant negative content, comparing yourself to others, and wasting hours and hours every day. I use **BePresent** to keep my screen time low, and app that uses gamification to help motivate you to have a healthy and intentional relationship with your phone.
3. **Cook.** It’s healthier, but it’s also makes your meals more enjoyable and meaningful. And it’s a great break from all the overwhelming aspects of life. I know it takes time and can be difficult, but cooking at least some of your meals during the week goes a long way. There’s a great app called **Parsnip** that makes learning to cook extremely easy and fun.
4. **Get as much sunlight as possible.** Our mood is very much affected by the weather. That’s because we are sun beings - the sun gives us energy. The more time you spend in the sun, the happier you are going to be.
5. **Stop caring about things that don’t matter.** Now this is obviously way easier said than done. But we waste so much time worrying about things that simply do not matter. There’s a great book that completely changed my outlook on things called **The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck.** Highly highly. recommend.",Straight-Adagio-2109,1b1eimz

-Pairing things I hate with things I love, like listening to standup comedy while washing the dishes, or putting a piece of candy in my daily med boxes like it’s some sort of psychotic advent calendar.

6,Be your own advocate. I feel like with mental health you really need to speak up and seek advice from health professionals. Mental health can still be a stigma in society.

7,"Fake plants have been shown to have a nearly identical impact on people in their living spaces as real plants, without any added anxiety about accidentally killing or adding things to someone's plate. Happy lamps have helped me a lot. Being with animals in any way - adopting, volunteering, going for a walk with a friend who has a pet. 

Making art of any kind is really helpful to me. Also, having over the ear noise cancelling headphones for when the world feels like too much can help me feel like I'm in a safe bubble. Any things that help reduce sensory overstimulation or feel soothing can be lovely- I also have an essential roller thing that I bring with me when I'm out and about, if I'm having a bad day. 

This one might surprise some people but having a mini trampoline in my place is also a nice way to move when I know that I need to but am not motivated enough to leave the house. 

Getting outside of myself and outside of my head is helpful- volunteering, going to a 3rd space like a library or a cafe where I can make eye contact with someone and simply be around other people doing normal things can close the gap between feeling really weird/down and feeling okay. 

After my pet passed away, I bought a weighted blanket and a stuffed animal that has a part you can microwave for heat. Being able to snuggle something with weight, if you don't have a partner or a pet, is really nice. 

Trying to stick to a schedule can help a lot. Even things like making sure you take your meds at the same time each day, having a glass of water each morning, etc, can make a big difference. 

Prioritize your sleep over all else, and try your best not to use any drugs or substances (caffeine, sugar, thc, etc) that can really interfere with your sleep. Having a bedtime routine where you put your phone away an hr before trying to sleep can be helpful. I also try to use bluelight blocking glasses in the evening in general so that if I am looking at screens I still am helping my body wind down. A warm shower, cup of night time tea, some light stretching, and no phones will do wonders for your sleep. 

Journaling helps me when I am feeling overwhelmed. Sometimes, if you feel stuck, setting a timer for 10 mins and just committing to writing anything can help a ton. Even if you write, ""I don't know what to write, I don't know what to write"" over and over, that will get you started. If you're not comfortable leaving what you wrote, just burn it. I used to have a practice where I would take one note card in the morning and one in the evening and just try to fill it, and then put it in a shoebox that I taped shut with a slit in the top. Then once a month would open up and just read through. 

Cold plunging can help some people, as can saunas (esp infrared saunas). If you have a hot springs near you with a cold pool- go! Time outside in nature is especially helpful. Again, even being near a window with natural light is a good step. If you can, open the window to feel the fresh air, even just a little bit. If that's easy, go outside for 10 minutes, even if you just stand. If that's easy, go outside for 30 minutes and go for a walk. And if that's easy, go outside and go for a run or take a birding book with you and look around. Or take art supplies and do something fun. 

Come up with hobbies that don't involve your phone or screens but still can lightly challenge your brain. Extra points if they involve movement of some type. Birding, chess, puzzles, art, reading, dancing, singing, etc are all good options that I like. You may need to try a variety of things before you find ones that actually work for you. Be willing to give things 1-3 chances but don't force yourself to do things that don't actually help. 

Anything that helps you focus on your breath and breathing is great. From box breathing techniques to hard workouts to yoga (yin and nidra have helped me especially) to just trying to think about gently pushing your breath further down in your body- all great. 

Overall, just know that there are many different schools of thought in the world about almost everything. What I believe is this- all your emotions are valid. That doesn't mean they are always right or always especially meaningful. It is possibly to acknowledge and validate their existence without buying into them too much. You can develop discernment over time, that is, you can come to learn and better understand which emotions are ""trying to tell you something"" about yourself and the world, and which ones might be logical byproducts of something else. An example: when I don't sleep well, I can end up feeling very anxious at a body level. Instead of then turning this into a thought that there is something wrong I need to go searching for, I can simply notice, validate that I am feeling anxious, but then take steps to help myself calm down from a somatic/body level, which will in-turn help my brain calm down a bit. Not every sensation needs to have deep meaning, especially for someone like myself who tends to overthink or apply a lot of meaning to a body that carries a lot of old stress. 

Remember that things can change- even if you've had a series of terrible minutes, weeks, days, or years, that doesn't mean that the future can't be bright and shiny. It does take intentional effort, often called work, to get there. And having safe spaces to vent about how you're feeling, without having people trying to ""fix"" that feeling for you is important. This can be hard to find but if you're not able to find this through therapy or in-person, there are places like reddit, online support groups, journaling, etc where that can happen. Have your own back, esp internally. Don't shut down your internal experience but gently or sometimes firmly question it, especially if you find yourself being hard on yourself. If you're able, try not to take other people's reaction to you personally. There are a lot of ""both/and"" situations in life- it's not another person's responsibility to take care of you all the time AND you deserve to be heard and validated by others. Sometimes people care a lot about one another AND don't have the necessary skills or bandwidth to show up for one another. Keep going, keep seeking, keep searching for people where you feel understood and seen as yourself. 

Above all else, great job for reaching out for additional information. I like to learn new things to help me try and be a little bit better. I personally struggle with avoidance, so sometimes I can notice that learning things is actually a way to avoid doing those things. That's okay, just zoom out a bit and try to look at trends over time, with lots of data points. You will mess up, especially if you're trying. That is okay, and is not necessarily a sign of failure or a sign that you are heading in the wrong direction. It's nice to have some sort of regular schedule/ritual to check in with yourself about the bigger goals you have and whether or not your choices and behaviors are leading you there. But, contrary to a lot of pop psychology advice, not every day can be 1% better or faster or stronger. Some days will suck a whole lot, and some seasons won't make a ton of sense. Again, that's okay, as long as you can keep a flexible perspective that can zoom in and out at times.",velocity_squared,1b1eimz

13,"I have chronic depression and have run the gammet on things to try and what works or what doesn't. For everyone, it'll be a bit different. But I've realized based on my energy levels, as that also drives your motivation a lot of the time, to make different checklists of coping skills or things to do depending on how motivated you feel to manage her depression. For example, if I know my energy/motivation is running low but know I still gotta put in some work with managing my depression I'll go with the smallest checklist that might include making sure my executive functioning is the priority. Making sure I'm eating, sleeping decently as I can, showering, cleaning up the kitchen enough to where I'm not avoiding making food, etc. Or making sure my bills are paid, or other types of basic functioning. On other times, I might go for another checklist that includes those things but also meditation, exercise, going out with friends, shopping, or a fun activity I know I like to do. I do these things because once I become overwhelmed, I freeze and don't do anything! When I really gotta do something, or else I'll start to circle the drain and that's never a good feeling! 

Also, just realizing what those red flags are for you when you feel yourself slipping into depression again. It's better to at least have the opportunity to try and catch yourself before you land face first into  a depressive episode. Those things can vary to each person, but for me it's isolating more than I usually do, or being more pessimstic and catastrophizing things a lot. Or not enjoying the things I know I normally do, etc.

20,"For me,. I think the biggest breakthroughs I've had were:

* Recognizing ""negative brain cycles"" (where you get caught in looping negative-thoughts).. and (upon realizing it),. break yourself out of it before it spirals even further into darkness. Even if ""breaking out of it"" is something really silly like ""think about baseball instead"" or ""walk down and check the mailbox"" or etc. 

* Try to take care of problems when they are small. (don't procrastinate). Often I've found that whatever thing I was worried about,. I was needlessly worrying about it because it turned out to be easier than I originally expected. 

* as others have said ""Food is medicine"" is really 100% true. If you cut out unhealthy food,. and (slowly at first if necessary) start adapting a more healthy nutrition habit(s).. you absolutely will notice a positive difference. 

* as cliche as it is (and others have said this with ""walking"" or ""hiking"")... the advice of ""exercise is helpful"" is also 100% true. Sometimes whenever I feel worried or stressed out by something,. the answer is to go exercise myself to exhaustion. Coming back home and stripping off my sweaty clothes and taking a nice hot long shower and just standing there for a bit (while my muscles twitch from exhaustion)... helps if nothing else to take my mind off of other things for a while.

If walking or moving around is not possible, sit/lay near a window where fresh air/ sunlight will come through. 

Even if it is not a sunny day outside, a cloudy day's light is brighter than indoor lights, and boosts serotonin.

82,"First, I'm sorry you're going through this, I've been there across 42 years. I'd like to try and help :) My biggest recommendations are the following:

- get outside. Do whatever you need to and get outside for at least 1 hour a day. It's so important to get fresh air and also get out of your home. If possible, work your way up to more hours outside, even if it takes weeks or months. 

- exercise. That goes hand in hand with getting outside so you could be doing two things at once if uoure walking while outside, which is great. Exercise, especially weight lifting (for women and men) helps with depression. You can research why but the results you'll feel really fast. Keep hydrated.

- start to know your boundaries. Do you need to release your connection to negative storylines or imagery (social media, news, people in your life who perpetuate  negative narratives, etc)? It's not about cutting yourself off from the world, it's about creating healthy boundaries for yourself so you are not a seed in a barren land, but instead in a nourishing environment. 

- (this point connects directly to the point above) Create new positive connections for yourself. Start small if you need to. Think of anything in life that has or currently does make you happy or even just interests you. Build on this. If being with animals gives you joy, maybe you can volunteer as a helper at a shelter or maybe find a way to integrate an income source that surrounds you with you animals (dog walker, cat sitter etc). That's only one example. It can be anything that you see as giving you a bit of joy and then trying to work on that.

- another point that's helped me a lot, is if you feel its possible for you (it may take some time after you start the other points above) try finding a way to help someone or be of service to making this world a bit better. It could be as simple as deciding to have coffee once a week with an elderly person who lives in your building or asking to sit and chat with an elderly at a coffee shop. Or maybe it's volunteering to help at a soup kitchen someone, maybe it's a role where you don't have to speak if you don't want to but you're still doing something that you know is helping and you feel a part of that. This connection to something good beyond ourselves is really transformative. 

- truly start to cherish both your physical and mental state. All the mystics speak in different ways of the triage of: body, mind and soul. Keep your thoughts on how these three are connected. When depressed, I suggest stopping the intake of any depressive, including alcohol. Seek out which foods feel good to your body and mind and soul. Enjoy how eating whole foods, instead of saturated or processed foods, can change the way you feel.

- lastly, BE KIND TO YOURSELF. Watch how you speak to yourself in your mind. Speak to yourself as if you were speaking to the child in you, see the you when you were 3 years old. Speak with kindness, love, patience and compassion. It's cliche, but true, it's a journey. 

Beyond writing a book here, these are my main points. I truly hope they help you and anyone else reading this. Know that how you feel now is only a reality now, and that reality can quickly and dramatically change into something positive. I know because it did for me also. 

You will find your path, and you can choose happiness. I send you all the best during this difficult time.

85,"Certainly! Here are some underrated mental health tips that everyone should know about:

1. Prioritize self-compassion: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, especially during difficult times. Self-compassion involves recognizing your own suffering and responding to it with warmth and care.
2. Practice gratitude: Take time each day to reflect on things you're grateful for, no matter how small. Practicing gratitude can help shift your focus from negativity to positivity and improve overall well-being.
3. Set healthy boundaries: Establishing boundaries in your relationships and daily life is crucial for protecting your mental and emotional health. Learn to say no when necessary and communicate your needs clearly to others.
4. Connect with nature: Spending time outdoors and immersing yourself in nature can have profound benefits for mental health, including reducing stress, improving mood, and fostering a sense of connection with the world around you.
5. Engage in creative expression: Whether it's through art, music, writing, or another form of creative expression, engaging in activities that allow you to express yourself can be therapeutic and help process emotions.
6. Practice mindful breathing: Incorporate simple breathing exercises into your daily routine to promote relaxation and reduce stress. Mindful breathing techniques can help you stay grounded and present in the moment.
7. Prioritize sleep hygiene: Quality sleep is essential for mental health, so establish a consistent sleep schedule, create a relaxing bedtime routine, and create a comfortable sleep environment.
8. Seek social support: Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or support groups when you're struggling. Connecting with others who understand and validate your experiences can provide valuable emotional support.",Classic_Ad_5292,1b1eimz

93,Exercise is pretty much the most powerful tool for depression. Don't overdo it though especially if you have energy issues you will burn yourself out and make yourself worse. I have chronic fatigue and I literally just showered daily and take a 3 minute walk. Without that 3-minute walk I feel significantly worse. Sounds absurd but studies prove that the first 5 minutes of any exercise has a lot more benefit to your body than the remaining minutes. For example if you walk for 30 minutes first 5 minutes could be doing half of the total benefit of that 30 minutes.,No_Whereas_6740,1b1eimz
94,Try not being on any screens except for TV for 4 days and see how you feel on the 5th What I mean is no phone screen no computer screen this basically applies to any screen that you would have close to your face. I don't know exactly why it does this to me but it likely has something to do with the light from the screen. Light plays an enormous role in signaling your brain to do certain things.  Also don't play video games if you have anxiety and or depression. The more intense the games the worst you're going to feel.Try coming off of them for four straight days and see how you feel for a few days after that. For some reason it takes 4 days to feel better so basically four straight days without playing any games and then I will feel better on the 5th day. Also the day after I stop I feel significantly worse then day 3 and 4 are the same as day one. It sounds weird but I have done this literally thousands of times where I will come off of playing computer games and the next day is significantly worse. It's like the chemistry of my brain is switching back so fast that it causes some kind of freak out and then it straightens out on the third and fourth day and after 4 days that's when the change happens. My body and maybe everyone seems to be on a 4-day schedule. It's weird everything that affects me positively or negatively 4 days to change around my brain chemistry. For example if it's sunny for a month straight and then it's dark and overcast for 3 days I'm fine but if it does overcast for four straight days on that fifth day my brain goes into a different kind of mode. It's almost like the brain doesn't want to change quickly so if anything changes it it doesn't allow that change to actually take place until it has been happening for 4 days. there are about five other things that work like this on a 4-day schedule in my body.,No_Whereas_6740,1b1eimz
95,Sunlight. Not only do you need sun on your skin to produce vitamin D for depression but also your circadian rhythms are governed by light. When you go out in the sun it's signals your brain feel good and it ready your body to sleep properly at night. That good feeling you get from sunlight is just light telling your brain to release feel good chemicals. If you can't go outside then open your blinds completely even if it's bright as shit for at least a half an hour a day. Also you cannot get vitamin D through glass. If you want vitamin D from the Sun you have to actually let it hit your skin directly.,No_Whereas_6740,1b1eimz

127,"Changing your mind based on updated information is great. Give yourself enough time to actually build skills - ie, allow yourself to do things without results. Sometimes you're in the part of the experience where you're laying the groundwork for the future. That doesn't always look or feel as shiny as social media makes it seem. Allow yourself the space to practice things without having something to show for it, if it serves the bigger picture. This is how people become great at things, including managing their thoughts/emotions/moods/making friends/getting a new job, etc. Think of it like an iceberg- there's a lot more happening under the surface then we might initially see. 

If possible, find small joys and humor in each day. I like the mantra ""Tragedy + time = comedy"". That's not always true (I find almost nothing is) but it can truly help a person when appropriate. Looking back, there are lots of times in my life that I might cringe at. It is also evidence that I have genuinely tried to grow and become a better and more thoughtful person. I thought one thing, based on my own personal experiences, that led me to certain behaviors. When I didn't like the outcome of those behaviors, I went and gained additional information, maybe changed my approach, practiced that for a while and then allowed myself the grace of reassessment and further change. Again, take your time. This is a lifelong process. 

Above all else, find some small meaning for yourself. I struggle a whole heck of a lot of extreme existential dread and lack of meaning sometimes. I have been through a lot of very painful things that, at times, have hardened me to the world. But in the smaller moments, I have found meaningful ways to see my life as having small purpose. I believe that all people deserve respect, so whenever I am able, I try to look people in the eye, ask them how they are doing, etc. It's different than thinking I need to be involved in massive policy change in order to ""be useful"", ""have meaning"" or ""be worthwhile"" to myself and the world. Start very small. Share a small kindness with someone, take one deep breath, be proud of yourself for waking up and facing the day. 

I hope that some of this very long (apologies!) answer was helpful. Kudos to you for asking the question. There are lots of things to do, and lots of things to not do. Simplify whenever you can.

6,"I don't know if this will make you feel better or worse. I started therapy when I was 62. People of my age rarely considered therapy as a ""thing"" for ""regular"" people. It never occurred to me as an option.

In retrospect, I feel like therapy would have helped at several points in my life. In the 1980's (my 20's), I was having night terrors, where I'd be kicking and yelling while dreaming. They were 100% due to my childhood crap. Late 80's, I had stitches while three guys held me down, setting me up for medical trauma. 90's, I had some pretty serious bouts of depression, and got tons of medical tests, but therapy was never mentioned. I had a mountaineering accident in 2001, that gave me PTSD, with flashbacks and a new fear of heights. I could have used therapy for that. 

I also had a long term relationship problem with my wife (married 36 years now), but I didn't start thinking about couples therapy until around 2015 (but I couldn't get her to go).

My Dad dying in 2016 wasn't too dramatic, and didn't seem to add to my woes. But, then a bunch of totally wild stuff happened. Mom got dementia, brother murdered, remaining sibs came into conflict and we broke up after our mother died. Her end of life care was contentious, etc.

All those things (and more) happening in a short period of time put me ""over the edge"" somehow, and I started having flashbacks to all the crap in my long past history. At that point, I knew I needed therapy, and as soon as I could get it.

If you think you need to ralk to someone, absolutely talk to someone. I wish I had in my teens, or the opportunity to without feeling like I was doing something wrong or that there would be a consequence.

16,"Reddit friend, please take a moment and breathe. You are not doomed. I think that perception and age might be skewing your view a bit, so I'll offer this up in case it helps account for those variables.

I'm 36, and I have anxiety, depression, ADHD, and my mother had BPD and alcoholism that I fret about inheriting. Thankfully, the two issues that she had have not yet darkened my mental doorstep, but I'm vigilant just in case.

I didn't get any official diagnosis until after I was 30, because my generation niche didn't see mental health the way people do now. Social media was very different when I was young, and had not yet become a place where people really shared information about mental health. We couldn't really network, so I think a lot of us suffered in isolation, and there was still a really big stigma about mental health challenges, as well as a lack of vocabulary to discuss what we were experiencing.

Movies and TV made jokes about kids on Ritalin. Prozac Nation and Girl, Interrupted were how we saw ""crazy"" people acting. Movie stars didn't admit that they got treatment, they just went ""on sabbatical"".

I kept my shit together for over thirty years, thinking I was ""fine"". I was an over-functioning, people-pleasing, constantly panicking mess. I was like the cartoon coyote, running out onto thin air. And then I finally looked down, and fell right into all the issues I'd been avoiding.

The reason I'm telling you this is that people under 25 that you see in these groups grew up in a different world. People are more open and honest about mental health. They are also able to connect in ways that I wasn't in my 20's. A LOT of people my age are getting diagnosed and treated later in life, and so many of us are not online the way that younger people are, which means we're likely underrepresented, which can look like we're all ""aged out"" of mental health struggles.

TLDR: people over 30 aren't ""better"". We just had a different societal awareness around mental health, lacked much of the information and vocabulary to discuss it, and we have a different relationship with social media.

I'm double your age, and add some. I've 'struggled' with mental health since half your age (feel free to do the math). In my personal observations, there are a lot of people who ""lose it"" more intensely as they age. I'd guess that small problems left untreated for a long time, grow until some event tips them over and at that point it's even harder to get back up again.  Most people with mental wiring issues never get ""cured"" - they just get tools by which to live in the world more successfully.  I give thanks daily that I have tools that work pretty well most of the time. 

Depending on the mental wiring you inherited and grew up with, and the stresses you've had to live with and through since, it's very possible that things seem to be getting more difficult than they were.

1. They are at a place of major transition in life, whether that’s going to college or selecting a career or getting married/broken up with or moving out from parents, and these times of transition often accompany a lot of anxiety, depression and need for social supports.

2. Some mental health issues start to manifest right around early 20s, especially bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. So they’re learning to live with this new diagnosis and figure out what it means to them.

Whether mental illnesses get better is really up for debate and there seem to be splits in research on it. I have heard that bipolar disorder gets worse with age, but I also read a paper that said it does not - it does shift in the way it manifests though. I did some reading that said schizophrenia sometimes spontaneously resolves with age, which is just incredible to me! Rates of depression increase with age. Rates of anxiety decrease. This kind of makes sense to me - depression is often ruminating on past choices, while anxiety is worrying about future ones, and if you just don’t have as long of a future, maybe that shifts the balance. A lot of personality disorders really level out with age. I guess what I’m saying is, no one knows. Everyone is different. You’re not beyond hope.

For example, Giacomo Leopardi, an italian philosopher, believed that human rationality in the beginning of the 18th century, where science started to become popular and really objective, is the reason why humans suffer. Instead of using our primitive rationality (you are hungry, you eat, you are satisfied), we want to seek more, we want *the truth*. But, the pleasures that are accessible to us are limited, but the desire to that pleasure is infinite.

\- There is a general overabundance of research interest in youth mental health, and middle-aged and elderly mental health is often seen as less important (problematically so).",EducatedGuessStack,17h3jt9

My mother is 56 and is bipolar, narcissist... Just unhinged in general. Her sole reason for not getting help, (and essentially destroying everyones lives around her) is she's ""too old for things like that"" and ""people my age dont need therapy. Theres nothing wrong with us"".

This has been a running theme in her side of the family. Its probably just an excuse, but I wish more older people would get the help they need instead of choosing to single handedly destroy families because they refuse to heal.

(For the record, I'm referring to my situation specifically, not everyone with mental health problems in general. So don't come at me.

I'm too tired a lot of the time to talk and even in therapy it's hard to talk because I'm exhausted. Even though I do therapy and take medication and get the therapy I can, it's just not going anywhere. 

I don't know where you got the idea that mental illness had an age limit and you suddenly switched it off and became mentally healthy, but it's wrong.  Maybe you see younger folks talk more about it because they have more time in their hands and feel stuff more intensely than us who have been dealing with this stuff for longer? Or maybe now people have more access to the internet and feel more comfortable talking about things? I don't know. Maybe they are crying out for help because they feel themselves spiralling and are scared (been there). Mental illness doesn't have a cure, just putting it out there.

3,"*Alcohol Use Disorder* can negatively affect mental health. If you have anyone in your family with substance problems, you are at risk for this disorder which means drinking even one drink could lead to alcoholism. AUD worsens depression and anxiety. If you are on SSRI or other psychiatric drugs, it could cause your medication to stop working.

I do think alcohol has its place in society and can be a welcomed treat sometimes. It can make you more relaxed about social situations, it can lead to some fun nights out with friends. It can lighten the mood at family gatherings. But it can also make all of these things 100x worse if abused. 

My advice is find out if you are predisposed genetically to AUD and talk to your psychiatrist before experimenting with alcohol. If your Dr. says it’s probably fine one time then hey, try it! Just have a plan for cessation such as “I’ll drink on my birthday and not again for __ weeks”.",Mermaidlike,1bwqfke

6,"Realistically if you drink in moderation, that is to say if you stick to enough that gives you a sense of ease without pushing it further; you won't have much of the nasty side effects that others try to scare you into. 

People who overdid it or don't know how to limit or have any discipline over the amount of drugs they consume often exaggerate because they experienced the more severe effects of what they took, rather than being smart and consuming them in a more mature manner. 

Depending on your weight and height, you can get away with having 2 shots worth and feel relatively good and wake up feeling as though nothing happened, especially as a light weight. If you push it past 4 shots, as an example, you'll generally feel very loopy and uncoordinated. This will later result in you potentially having a hangover, if at all, due to the fact that your body takes longer to process the alcohol by the amount you take in. I can't remember the exact amount of time, but it's a slow process, so in general you want to take it slow and limit yourself. 

Please note that why I'm suggesting this is because realistically no one can stop you from experimenting. The people telling you its bad or that you shouldn't just want to attempt to look after you like a helicopter parent, thinking that they're doing some kind of good. But ultimately its up to you. My best advice is that if you are going to try alcohol no matter what any one says; stick to a small amount first, because if you're prone to addiction this might not be the best decision for you. The feeling can be very addicting

I went into a lot of debt and wasted too much time trying to people-please and pretend to be someone I wasn’t; this was extremely mentally damaging and I am still in recovery, 4 years later. Alcohol is so widely accepted in society, I imagine because the majority of society cannot admit to our really big problems and would rather suppress them in the name of “fun” - this is also why many people struggle with therapy, because the truth can be difficult to face, it’s a lot easier to squish yourself into a box of lies!",Own-Championship-398,1bwqfke

10,"Alcohol is very nasty. Luckily it’s an acquired taste so if you stay away from it and almost never have it - it will always feel foreign and yuck. That’s the best place to be with alcohol.

In terms of drinking, it doesn’t do any ‘one’ thing, of you measure anxiety in ‘units’ and then depression in ‘units’. Basically for every ‘unit’ of anxiety alcohol may remove (which doesn’t always work) the next day as it wears off you repay the debt about 5 to 1 or 10 to 1. That is to say you’ll get 10 units of anxiety for every 1 unit that was removed from drinking the alcohol the night before.

With depression it’s similar too, however unlike anxiety it doesn’t happen straight away. After you drink, it spreads out the depression over a longer time span over weeks and it’s very subtle. So if you drink every weekend you’re just kind of perpetually 10% to 20% more depressed than you would be without it. But I won’t say I understand all of the neurochemistry around that one.

So yeah good question - alcohol is a poison and there’s no shortcut to handle mental health with it. I would make a note to just say if alcohol does make you feel ‘better’ that is exceptionally dangerous as can create addiction and you know the rest there… the more you have it the more you need to ‘feel better’ so you can go downhill very badly.

33,"Almost always.

We learn over time to suppress or in some other way use anxiety to suppress a lot of our symptoms. That is why a lot of us are so mentally drained at the end of the day.

Alcohol removes inhibitions. That removes that suppression, so the depression becomes deeper, the PTSD triggers become stronger, the dissociation becomes more impactful, and our emotional regulation stops. We are easier to get pissed off or suicidally depressed....More than 1/4 of suicides which are completed are done so under the influence of alcohol.

However, just to be complete, in limited quantities, alcohol has a similar effect to benzodiazepines like klonopin in reducing anxiety in anxiety disorders.. It reduces anxiety, in many who have anxiety disorders or PTSD. However, this is the same reason that people with PTSD or severe anxiety are more likely than most to become severe alcoholics and die of cirrhosis of the liver or other liver related illnesses.

This is because alcohol is literally a poison. A teratogen, meaning that it kills cells. This is the reason that Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder exists. It kills the cells that are responsible for the formation of the embryo and fetal development. THis includes the formation of very important parts of the brain, particulary those involving the brain and facial structures. People with FASD tend to have either facial deformations or a very similar facial morphology and the structures of the brain resposible for self-regulation and behavioral control are not able to form correctly, which can cause issues like severe intellectual disorders or impulse control disorders. 

On the other hand, for some people, alcohol increases anxiety because it removes the defenses, we have built up against it.

In my personal experience, I did things under the influence of alcohol that put me at risk. I drove a lot. That could have caused accidents and I could have hurt or killed someone else or myself. I could also have gotten arrested and screwed up my life. The only reason I did it was that the alcohol allowed me to convince myself that I was a better driver when I was drunk than when I was sober because my father was.

I come from a long line of alcoholics. I see what alcohol has done to my family (my family is native american and there's a long history of trauma stemming from being NA). The alcohol has thrown fire on top of the trauma and mental illness many of them suffer from. 

I have two sisters... One drinks, one doesn't (i never have). It's insane to me to watch my alcoholic sister making her mental health suffer by drinking constantly.

Please take care of yourself. I truly mean it that you aren't missing out by not drinking. Take the money you would have spent on alcohol and invest in a hobby or mental health services. You'll be happy you did!",conflictmuffin,1bwqfke

41,"I really don’t think this is true. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve noticed that feeling “fine” the next day, meaning not hungover, isn’t the whole story. My emotional regulation and patience can be lessened, and while I may not feel bad physically I don’t really feel good either. I’m 32 and used to work in the alcohol industry. I’ve since cut way back - I didn’t quit drinking but I usually choose a non alcoholic option when going out. If I do drink, it’s 1-2 drinks only and I do it once a week or less. I do notice a difference if I have 2 drinks 2-3 times in one week. By the end of the week I feel worse even if I never really feel “hungover.” I didn’t feel this way at 21 and I do think turning 30 seems to have marked the beginning of a reduction in my body’s ability to metabolize alcohol. All this is just to say that there’s a difference between not feeling obviously terrible and knowing that you’re not feeling your best. Moderate alcohol consumption has moderately negative effects, which isn’t shocking. I’m not gonna deny that being drunk is fun, but at the very least it must be treated as pure entertainment with no other function. It’s like gambling. If you gamble because you think you’ll really hit it big, you’ll lose everything. If you gamble in moderation and only bet what you can afford to lose, you won’t ruin yourself and you might have fun. But if you don’t gamble at all, you will be richer than the average person who has your income but does gamble.",deadcelebrities,1bwqfke

And not to mention it seems (not sure if this is scientifically proven) once you've gotten to that point where you've overindulged (drinking heavy) it sticks with you. It seems to take a lot more to actually feel ""good"", while simultaneously it's guaranteed to make me feel absolutely horrible the next day. Although with vodka it seems quite the opposite. I can down almost half a bottle and feel relatively fine the next day.

Obviously as you mentioned it just depends on how well we process it through our body. 

I think the two main points to be made here are; overall alcohol isn't worth consuming. Hell, to be quite honest I'm more of an advocate for marijuana use over anything. But in the end I wanted to make sure the poster understands what they may be getting themselves into without also making it out to be something completely terrible.

Even if shitty things are happening to you, you can have a healthy or unhealthy response to that.

You don’t see me bitching about either of those things to them but I can’t play video games without getting shit. It might sound silly to freak out over video games but it’s the only thing that can help me take my mind off stuff.

I can’t afford to move out because I’m in school full time and I can only work one day a week, making minimum wage. I had enough money in my savings to move out but she said it “zeroed out”. I don’t know what I could have possibly owed her that was thousands of dollars and if there was, she should have communicated that with me. So I think she took my money from me.

119,"I own quite a bit of tarot decks, but mainly because I love the idea of archetypes; I don’t really fuck around with them too much anymore. I prefer to go through the individuation process of bringing to light the shadow by mainly working with dreams, taking note of what bothers me in other people, and analyzing projections. Lately I’ve been processing the hero worship I’ve engaged in and it’s brought to light some of the more positive aspects of the shadow. 

I’ve had 3 episodes of mania with psychosis and my shadow/unconscious mind ran rampant and almost ruined my life some years ago. I’ve been processing those episodes ever since. I did listen to an episode of This Jungian Life podcast that was talking about using tarot for shadow work, so it’s something I’ve been thinking of as a good idea.

132,"There are definitely people who have been hurt by people with NPD and ASPD, but generalizing everyone with them as bad or abusive isn’t good. Especially (to me) when most times I see it it’s people arm chair diagnosing their abusers with those disorders just because of their abusive behavior. I usually try to remind people that people with depression are technically just as likely to be abusive (neglect) but of course you’re not going to generalize all depressed people like that. I’ll add, I don’t think this person is an “ableist person” or anything, but it’s possible to make an ableist comment without being a bad person, and as someone with those disorders I personally find it important to educate people on.",FtM_Jax0n,17fsni5

Crazy for you to say that while using the word “sociopath.” Since you’re so knowledgeable on the human brain, *surely* you would know that “sociopaths” don’t actually exist, it’s just a movie term, and even though it isn’t great either, at the very least you should use the word “psychopath” instead, since at least that one actually used to be accepted and used.

Of course, anyone with NPD or ASPD can be a bad person, just as anyone with ASD can be, or depression, or schizophrenia, or DID, but just as it would be ableist to say something like “schizophrenics and people with DID do” in response to the comment, the same goes for saying the same but with NPD and ASPD. That comment *was* ableist. Having either disorder (or any other one) doesn’t make someone a bad person, nor does it make anyone do certain things like you said or act in the same way.

They have no true evidence that they can't work around things like that. That's what help is for. It doesn't have to be a normalized thing, I'm just saying it's a thing we can't control.

142,"Well, no matter how bad any one person with NPD is, you’re worse for judging many person just for a disorder that they couldn’t choose and only developed from severe trauma as a way to protect themselves.",FtM_Jax0n,17fsni5
143,"I feel that you are misinterpreting the listed symptoms there a bit. Most people with ASPD (though I’m sure not all because everyone’s different) simply do not care enough to fully harm someone for no reason at all. However, they can be more than willing to harm someone who (they feel) is wronging them. Since we struggle with paranoia, past abuse/trauma, and anger, something smaller can trigger this fight response than what it takes in neurotypical people and people without ASPD. This especially applies for ASPD (more that CD) because someone can have ASPD without currently doing any antisocial things (because it’s a personality disorder, so it focuses more on lack of empathy and shallow emotions than behavior, in contrast to how CD is specifically a behavior disorder). People with ASPD are more impulsive, so they will get in more fights and/or mentally hurt someone who has hurt them in some way. Probably because of a combination of movies showing people with ASPD as smart, cold-blooded killers and people armchair diagnosing their abusers with it, many people incorrectly assume that this is what people with ASPD are. In truth, we mostly suffer from anhedonia, which causes us to be more impulsive, but also is why people with ASPD usually turn to alcohol, drugs, and (impulsive/risky) sex. While I’m not denying that some people with ASPD do harm others, it’s also important to remember that *every* person with ASPD is first harming themself. That’s what the disorder (as with other disorders) truly is. All disorders are like this, especially those developed from trauma (such as NPD, DID, CPTSD, etc.) which heightens that fight or flight response (even when not necessarily needed) to protect the person. This is why I brought up depression. Just like ASPD, some of the symptoms can lead to abusive (specifically neglectful, whether physically or mentally, when speaking about depression) behaviors, but it’s not the disorder itself fully doing that, nor does it describe everyone (or near everyone) with that disorder. No person with ASPD is inherently a bad person; that’s impossible to say.",FtM_Jax0n,17fsni5

149,"Of course having trauma doesn’t excuse abusive behavior, but it’s just wrong to assume that all or most people with NPD (or any other disorder) are abusive. That’s not what the disorder is at all.",FtM_Jax0n,17fsni5
150,"Yes, people with ASPD are similar to those with other trauma disorders in that they can have the same large response to something that doesn’t warrant it because it’s the disorders way of protecting them so they are never put through something terrible again. The only difference is that someone with ASPD will not feel remorse after it, they will feel it to be necessary (obviously I know that other disorders can feel this too but it’s less often). Still, that doesn’t make the person immediately a bad person. They are simply missing an emotion, and (if they have cognitive empathy, which most do) they are still able to understand why the action was wrong and choose not to act in wrong ways (when they can), they just don’t feel bad about it, because their brain stops that. There’s at least more self control there, whereas with other disorders it’s harder to learn that self control of how to not act out harshly to protect themselves, I guess because more emotions are involved for them.",FtM_Jax0n,17fsni5

Lately, I've decided to embrace my ""weirdness"": things that I suppressed to fit into the neurotypical social standards. I've always been told that a lot of the things I like/do are a result of bad parenting. Now, as an adult, I'm learning that a lot of those things were signs of autism, and that those ""weird"" behaviors (stimming, mimicking, fixations, etc.) aren't from my parents' failures and don't need to be ""cured"".",frostydreamsandwish,qr3umr

I wanted it and was going to go to this one place I go to for sex (bad).. it took a lot of mental strength to convince myself not to go to this place.

I like to have CBD tea which I understand doesn’t technically contain CBD but has CBDa which turns into CBD when it gets heated. The brand of tea I have is called Mind and Body Botanicals (I am in the UK) as it tastes great and I really enjoy it. I also use CBD oil drops (you drop a few under your tongue) you can get varying strengths I’d suggest starting with a lower strength and gradually increasing the dose per day. I think the recommended max is 70mg per day and I personally don’t go over that though I have read in the r/CBD of people going higher",,qr3umr

If anything, this therapist should be saying ""its all a part of gods plan and god does not bare a human soul with more than it can handle""

If religion is what works for you, then go ahead. But in my experience, mental illness can be for ANY reason, sometimes depression can occur with no rhyme or reason at all.

They con patients with their own personal beliefs then allow the mental illness to go untreated until something horrible happens.

26,"Absolutely not. I have had this happen. If you can find their credentials and accreditations, see if they belong to the American Association of Christian Counselors. They have a ""code of ethics"" that compels them to insert their religious beliefs into therapy. From my experience, they seem to think that mental illness stems from a lack of belief and adherence to their form of Christianity. That group just stopped doing conversion therapy in 2014. 
Even if your therapist doesn't belong to that group, there's clearly a similar mindset. It's insidious to take advantage of the trust a patient gives to a therapist to work in their own motives. It has *nothing* to do with your father, either. That seems like some patriarchal aspect of their religion being thrust upon you, once again, abusing your trust. If it doesn't make sense to you, I wouldn't put any stock in it.

Idk js sometimes your personal idea of treatment won't align with that particular provider and that's ok . I just also feel they get even more pushy when they sense youre not an easy sell and it just gets awkward .

31,No definitely not and that for me is a red flag if any of my therapist started this would definitely say good poor practise on his or her have region should not be focused upon anyone. Healthy communication with any therapist is for them to know what ok and what not myself and one of my friends I made while in hospital set boundaries while starting so they know that the sessions are there and they don’t go out of bounds to keep it a safe place to talk there shouldn’t be judgment at all with a professional willing and able to help us.,Ok_Activity_7021,y5ad6r

65,"Faith shouldn’t play a part in therapy. I will say my faith has helped me tremendously with my anxiety and depression, but that was a personal choice for me. Everyone has their own journey. For me, I am not willing to take meds and I’ve also gained some tools as a mindset development coach along the way. I use the tools and I also have great people around me. I know what I need to do first thing in the morning to set myself up for not being as reactive throughout the day. Main point is this: your therapists shouldn’t be telling you what to believe in. That’s your choice. Having a spiritual belief is important, but your beliefs are your beliefs. There’s a good book by Dr. Joe Dispenza, called “Breaking the habit of being yourself” that I highly recommend. It talks more about quantum physics as well as implements faith practices and explains how they go hand and hand. Faith doesn’t just mean God. It means you believe in something bigger than yourself. I can say from personal experience that believing in something bigger than myself and holding myself to a higher standard (sometimes too high, which I’m still working on that too) is why I’m still here on this earth. 

I will say this from personal experience - not every mentor, therapist, or coach is for you. Find one who is.

85,"May I ask another pointed question: do you ever feel this therapist has tried to seduce you? How did you find them? Did they disclose they are a religiously based therapist and did you know that in the beginning ie was that a selling point for you? (I think not, just checking though.) and what is this therapist’s level of education and training? I’m asking because therapy binds the patient to the therapist emotionally and then guides them to better choices and relationships via that bond and I have benefitted from MSCSW help. Would you feel safe, or not safe, brining this concern to them in therapy? These questions for me would help guide my decision about whether they are right for me, and I hope to be useful to you in your journey so you feel safe.",UncertainlyUnfunny,y5ad6r

Even having someone to talk to about what's going through your brain can be helpful, especially if you don't want to be put on any medication, which is my partner's issue. He was always medicated as a child, and self-medicated as an adult, without actually learning any coping skills.

Got down to the point of only putting in 0.2 grams in my only joint of the day. This was enough for me to just about feel the effects of the weed and to dampen the withdrawal. Eventually I managed to get it to smoke once every other day then Eventually to nothing. My advice is when you've fully stopped don't ever go back to it.

9,"What helped me quit

Cutting back on the amount of times I smoked for two weeks and then switching to CBD only. CBD helped a lot more once my tolerance was down.

Taking really cold showers (this gives a natural high and helped distract me from cravings)

Going back to hobbies that I quit when I started smoking daily(reading, writing, sewing)",No-Winner-3369,1b26r8m
10,"Cut yourself from that routine, that environment or those people that lead you to smoke. You have an advantage that your partner doesn't smoke, you could spend some more time with them and distract yourself. Over time  you have to learn to trick your brain into forgetting about it. Block your resources into some savings to cut money supply to score more, I understand this will impact other expenses too but better have savings for later practically burn whatever you have. Lastly, only you can remind yourselves why you are quiting and what it means for you long term. I am telling you this because I did all this and got over my addiction, been clean for 2 months now, and I feel the best physically, mentally and also am able to better focus on my career and relationships, because now I live life the way it is, than a toned down version of it because of the THC. 

Now these tips might or might not work on you thw same way they did for me, but the key is to recognize your own patterns and your own capabilities both mental and emotional, you have to strengthen that first. I told myself that if you do this for yourself, nothing can stop you for achieving anything you set your mind to, and its been working so far, but I'm still taking one day at a time.

Currently down to about 2-3x per week, now mostly cannaoil over smoking (way better)

Lessons to share:
1.
The main reason people struggle to quit and get high is boredom, second stress.
=
Tackle these with planning fun things to do / self care things to do to keep you preoccupied to start tapering off. Especially evenings.

2. 
Failure is part of the process.
The more offs you have the more habitual it becomes to do other things than weed.
After a day or 2 off, you may trick yourself and reward with a smoke but you'll likely fall straight back into ingrained habit.
Try not to feel bad about smoking e.g. don't focus negatively on the cake, focus positively on doing healthy things.

3.
Weed will always be there, humans are bad at balance.
Take a break, find some balance, treat each day for its own day - 'I'm just wanting to stay sober today' and keep doing that each day

4.
Sleep
=
Matthew walker why we sleep made an impact on me, started to realise a lot of the negative issues were down to the fact that I was not getting quality REM on ganj. Wanting to have more days off substances than on is a great focus to understand balance.

14,"Smoking weed so young was a bad idea. Your brain has probably developed around it and your brain chemistry is probably incredibly unbalanced without it. Though it sounds like you're also suffering from the other negative effects of long term Marijuana consumption too.

Here's my suggestion.

You should probably see a psychiatrist. They can help by diagnosing what is making it so hard for you and prescribe medications that can level out your brain chemistry both making it easier to quit and fixing loads of other psychological issues. The meds will make you feel normal and you might be able to cut back and stop taking them entirely (with your doctor's approval) after you've quit Marijuana and have been stable for a while.

You should also consider either attending substance abuse/quitting support groups or at least asking for the advice and guidance of someone who has been successful at quitting Marijuana consumption.",Hexent_Armana,1b26r8m

19,"My grandpa was in AA for 45+ years. Once, when my cousin went to talk to my grandfather about his abuse problem and kept trying to justify it by saying, ""I only smoke a little. I only drink every now and again.""

My grandfather, who has attended countless meetings and heard all the stories, just said to him, ""You can't be half pregnant."" Just another perspective of saying you can't traditionally be halfway in and half way out.

As others said, changing your routine would help immensely.  Not as a long-term thing - but committing to doing something challenging (workout, practice a new skill) and then after rewarding yourself with something different than weed after doing that for the meantime. (Chocolate bar, video games, whatever your thing.)

If you stop purchasing weed, you will undoubtedly have some extra cash flow for a new hobby or adventure.

That being said, when I was about 18 and really needed to quit for a while to pass a drug test and get a job it helped me to just have a little bit of weed stashed away. Kind of like a safety net.

Was a pretty crazy awesome world out there that you can enjoy weed with healthy sometimes in moderation but I've been at the point where it definitely is unhealthy and I understand where you're coming from.

Best of luck. A lot of it is habit.. start doing something else to fill that void. You end up feeling bored and want to smoke. Keep yourself busy, don't give yourself as much time to smoke. 
Good luck.",6nayG,1b26r8m

84,"This is untrue. A lot of people experience physical withdrawal symptoms from cannabis. 

OP, you should check out r/leaves or r/petioles. r/leaves typically has people who want to quit completely, while r/petioles tends to surround cutting back, t-breaks and moderation. I've found both communities helpful in my attempts to cut back/quit cannabis. I've been lurking on those subs for a couple of years, attempting to quit cannabis completely since January, and have finally managed to get 24 hours abstaining under my belt. It's not much, but it's a start, and I'm proud of myself for that. I haven't been sober this long for over 2 years. For context, I'm 38F, started smoking when I was 15, and have been using daily for about 15 years. The last 5 years or so, I've used pretty consistently from waking until I go to bed, depending on what I had to do that day. I suffer from pretty rough depression and am trying to quit for my mental health as well. I know it's hard OP, and things very well may feel worse for you before it gets better but this internet stranger is rooting for you and my DMs are open if you want to chat.

There is a rehab center which offers support groups for addiction of various substances: alcohol, cocaine, meth, cannabis, etc.

Sometimes the members of Cocaine anonymous and members of other ""hard drugs"" would make fun of the Marijuana Anonymous members because they considered weed a ""weak drug"". I was a member of Marijuana Anonymous and I felt very insulted by the comments of those people I mentioned. Within the Marijuana Anonymous there were fellow members who would spend thousands on cannabis, and cannabis destroyed relationships. Also, quitting weed was very difficult for most of us. Quitting weed is not a piece of cake.",PlantATreeYouFool,1b26r8m
91,"I kindly disagree. Lack of appetite, nausea, GI issues, insomnia, sweats (night or otherwise, as I'm tapping away on my tablet with sweaty palms), headache, physical restlessness, etc. I feel are all linked to the physical dependency that some people do experience. I do however acknowledge that physical dependency with cannabis is less than it is with something harder like heroin or meth, for example (I haven't used either, but this is my understanding). I honestly used to think cannabis wasn't physically addictive, but found that to be untrue in my case, especially when I took a month long break a couple of years ago and had some brutal physical withdrawals that lasted about a week, if I recall right. All that said, not everyone has the same experience when quitting, and I can only speak to my own.

92,"Just to add this is a short description of cannabis use disorder from wiki.   

Cannabis use disorder (CUD), also known as cannabis addiction or marijuana addiction, is a psychiatric disorder defined in the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and ICD-10 as the continued use of cannabis despite clinically significant impairment.[2][ 
Does the psychiatric disorder cause physical dependency? I don't believe so. 
I do not doubt that it causes physical symptoms though. Like, nausea or headaches. I would argue those effects stem from psychiatric disorder. Cannabis is addictive, that's clear. The psychiatric disorder causes physical symptoms in many people.
 
Like I mentioned, I guess I'm lucky. I know everyone is different and does not react the same. I have no physical symptoms when I don't smoke for an extended period. If physical dependency happened with marijuana, there would be much more widespread issues.",6nayG,1b26r8m

Built yourself a high expensive tolerance maybe?",halfbreed_prince,1b26r8m
94,"I appreciate you taking the time to look up some sources, however I still kindly disagree. Maybe take a peek at the subs I mentioned previously, especially r/leaves. I feel like there are widespread issues with physical dependency and withdrawl, but that is just my opinion...",W_i_F_Up,1b26r8m
95,I could smoke like 10 joints a day,GothicBettaMummy,1b26r8m
96,"I don't mean to change your opinion. I accept it. I also kindly disagree. I believe there are deep rooted societal problems associated with mental health that and weed exasperates some of those problems. A large amount of individuals have mental health problems. 
I also may have mixed you up by referring to the physical withdrawal symptoms in the same terms as physical dependency. As having gotten caught up in North America's opiate epidemic, I experience the stark difference between a drug causing physical decency and one that is psychiatric with physical symptoms. Like how benzo withdrawal is well known to cause seizures. Cannabis has nothing like that. There is no known widespread, near guaranteed physical withdrawal symptom that happens from marijuana.  
I'm also very familiar that everyone is different. We respond similar to most things since we are human, however people are all unique when it comes to substances. Maybe I'm just lucky I don't get the effects many others do. In terms of cannabis withdrawal, I get cravings, and I'll feel a touch down, so low mood. I also struggled with anxiety and depression terribly for decades, and didn't think I'd be able to go without cannabis.  
Like you, I smoked from 15 until 34 everyday unless I was unable to get. I am a daily smoker still, cannabis is an amazing medicine! I guess what I'm getting at is, it's possible and likely easier than we think to cut down or stop/control our use. In my experience a lot of addiction gets tied to habit. Smoking is habitual. That's why people will replace smoking with fidgetting with something or snacking, to keep the hands doing similar motions as smoking, tricking the brain into releasing that satisfying dopamine we all want. Speaking of which, this is also why we feel shitty when we don't have, as our brain starts relying on the drug for dopamine production.  
I sometimes will do a light workout when I don't have smokeables, as I find it helps cuz my brain will give me a lil boost lol.

Also, this could very well be because cannabis hasn't had the rigorous testing all the pharmaceuticals have. In comparison with alcohol and tobacco as well I don't think there has been nearly as much study or noticeable health burden on a populace from cannabis, except for the similar health effects caused from smoking in general. 

Anywho I've typed far too much already. 😅
  
TL;DR- No, you're right and I believe you. I may caused confusion between physical withdrawal and dependency. Yes, many people do report withdrawal symptoms of a physical nature. I neglected things like blood pressure symptoms, as smoking effects blood pressure, isn't cannabis exclusive. 
Depression and mental health are hard to deal with as is. I know cannabis helps so many of us. Unfortunately there are many who's brain chemistry just doesn't mix with delta9 THC and the mix of cannabinoids. 
Smoking is habitual, replacing smoking with a physically similar habit tricks the brain, helping to rewire and change our habits. Helps with cutting down and quitting.  
Best of luck to anyone trying to cut down/control your use!",6nayG,1b26r8m
97,"Oh damn lol you’re a chronic. Weening off of it and having 3 joints a day would be a good start. Get a better high too. When i smoked lots, the weed just ended up making me feel burnt out most of the time.",halfbreed_prince,1b26r8m
98,"I've just gotta say, I really do appreciate how you've approached this conversation. You've been incredibly considerate, thoughtful and respectful throughout, although we obviously have differing opinions on some aspects, so thanks for that, sincerely. Doesn't always go this way on the internet haha 

I'm with you that weed can exasperate mental health issues in some individuals, me being one of them, unfortunately... BUT I also admit that in the last handful of years I've been majorly over-using cannabis for short term relief of depression and anxiety, and that's partly what has gotten me into the situation I'm in now. I would love to be able to get to an point where I can take advantage of all the benefits cannabis can offer through moderated use, but I don't know anymore. That's awesome that you're able to though and I admit I am a bit envious at the moment haha... 

I also admit that I did misinterpret what you meant about physical dependency versus withdrawals initially and you're right, there is definitely a difference between the two... and I'm sorry that you've found yourself caught up with opiates, and truly hope you're doing better now and never have to endure something like that again (if I understood properly that you dealt with it personally, opposed to being affected by a family member's use or what have you).

99,"Thank you very much. I totally reciprocate with that feeling. You've been a delight :) . It is hard to find others who will maturely converse. Especially in long format. Hard enough to get a response more than a couple sentences. Or words out of some lol. 
I've definitely learned a lot from my struggles, thank you. There is a lot of stigma around the opiate epidemic, so I kind of relate with the mental health stigma there. Even though I do have PTSD, it's not known by many. Having to deal with methadone in an open setting makes the opiate matter hard to keep private. I'm open about it anyway though.   
Thanks to you too for the convo, it's been nice! It made my evening more thoughtful for sure. I actually come across a good paper cuz of this interaction. Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances, with a rating of 13.2 and cannabis is a 13! That surprised me for sure. I didn't doubt it's addictive properties but didn't think it was as close to tobacco. I forget the name of the index used.

Some of us also have issues with our minds. Like medical issues that require medication. Bipolar, schizoafffective, OCD, etc. These need to be treated with therapy and medication combined.

Some have personality disorders. Borderline, anti-social, narcissism. Borderline can be treated with therapy. The other two are just really fucking hard to deal with.

Some have thought disorders. ""I'll never be good enough.""I might as well give up.""They always have friends, and I have none.""I can't go on this way."" This can absolutely be treated with professional therapy. Often, thought disorders only need a change in mindset.

There are also physical issues that can lead to mental health issues and suicidal ideation, like chronic pain. Like severe chronic pain.

I am happy pretty much all the time, and when I start to not feel happy, I figure out why and then adjust to fix whatever it was.   I also set attainable goals for myself, big and small, and celebrate achieving them, even if it was something as simple as remembering to do something every day for a week that I commonly forget.  When I don't achieve a goal in the time I'd planned for, I think about why, work out how to avoid or adapt to it and then get to the goal I'd been striving for.  I refuse to ever hate myself, or be angry at myself, though I'll admit sometimes I do annoy me but they're short lived and rare.

Sure I've faced adversity in my life.  I was in a severely abusive relationship in early adulthood.  I've been on the verge of homelessness a few times.  Clawed my way back to sober from a substance addiction and have stayed sober for almost 30 years.  I found out that my husband and I can't have kids when I'd always wanted to be a mom.  Lost close friends and family to various things over the years.  So on and so on.

However, I am an extremely lucky person and have been blessed with a lot of things in life.  A loving family, an amazing husband, a career I love.  My health hasn't always been the best but its on a great trajectory now.  I tend to focus a lot on those blessings and remind myself to be thankful for them in addition to sorting out the cause when I start to feel like I'm getting down.  I remind myself that there are people in this world who are a heck of a lot worse off than I am, and facing things that I couldn't even imagine much less endure and that makes me even more grateful for the life I have.

8,"Apologies in advance, this is going to be long. Mark Fisher has some poignant things to say about this and I’m going to attempt to summarize. 

In my opinion it’s to do with the fall out of late stage capitalism. In *Capitalist Realism: is there really no alternative* Mark Fisher posits that “it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism”. Fisher understands capitalism to be “the widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it”, and I agree.

Capitalism however is not without consequence, and Fisher expands on this. In capitalist society, everything has a value. Everything has a price, from harvested organs to works of art, from health care to, well, any kind of cultural expression really. The very moment we ask ‘what’s this worth’, that price proceeds to overshadow all intrinsic, abstract and intangible values and properties. Over time these are lost. Fisher calls this process the ‘desacrilization of culture’. It’s a process of conditioning, resulting in empty commercial cultural phenomena like ‘black Friday’, which, where I’m at in the world, is already a week long event.

Capitalism works so long as we buy into it, mentally and literally. We need to keep on believing that this (monetary) value driven concept of society is hyper rational, logical, a natural terminus of logical thought on how to self organize and allocate resources. But there are some major and severe fault lines.

First, the effect of capitalism on climate change. Our ecosystems are collapsing because of capitalist pursuit of unlimited growth. This leads to extremes. Science is being denied and trivialized when it points out the obvious: life as we go about it currently is simply not sustainable. 

Then there’s the vast bureaucracy. Despite notions of innovation and efficiency we’re mostly just seeing mountains of paperwork and complicated processes and rules and regulations and whatnot, much of it seemingly pointless. Culture becomes stagnant, innovation will end, greed will prevail. 

Then, thirdly, and to the point of the OP: there’s our declining mental health. Depression is becoming more and more prevalent in western society. To an extent this has to do with changing methods of diagnosis and increased awareness and we’re always quick to blame social media, it in itself another symptom of capitalism. Fisher doesn’t deny that chemical imbalances in the brain can lead to depression and other mental illnesses. But he notices that capitalism encourages us to seek solutions and causes within ourselves. Whether in the brain, in our family, or in our upbringing, instead of in the system in which all of these circumstances exist in the first place. Mental health exists in the brain, but doesn’t begin or end there. Mental illness exists as a systemic problem in capitalist society with its relentless atomization of the individual; a core tenet of neo-liberalism. Ongoing stigma around mental health is part and parcel of this. So, the solution doesn’t necessarily (only) lie in the brain, but goes much, much further than that. We have become a lonely and disconnected sum total of individuals driven by a relentless societal need for economic growth but towards what we don’t understand exactly. 
 
So, in summary. Fisher understands the current mental health crisis as a severe symptom of a failing model of society, that we’ve been conditioned into accepting unconditionally, and I agree with him.

TL/DR: Read Mark Fishers *Capitalist Realism: is there really no alternative*. It’s only around 90 pages long and really should be required reading for everyone.",wisefoolhermit,1bzrfus

13,"Being nicer and more open about mental health doesn't fix the problem. Look at how many people are comfortable talking about their poor mental health while doing nothing at all about it. I know plenty of people in my personal life even who have asked me how I fixed xyz problem because they have the same thing, I recommend resources and 6 months later they tell me they didn't even try one of them.


Also a broader conversation doesn't mean a deeper one. Look at how many people think the phrase ""mental health"" is synonymous with depression e.g. ""she has mental health"" as a full sentence. There's little conversation about what a positive mental health even looks like. 


One sticky issue is that people who talk about their poor mental health online often are looking to vent for now, rather than work to fix problems.  Another is that the steps from ""I have no problem"" to ""okay I have problems but nothing can save me"" to ""I clearly have problems and am now in a place I can put energy and attention towards fixing things"" are vague and difficult to intentionally implement in oneself nevermind in others, even to well educated and experienced professionals. Another is that external finger pointing is so easy, its obviously capitalisms fault that I'm like this, it's my string of toxic exes, it's just brain chemistry, and so on. When people believe that the reason they can't function is completely out of their hands, why would they spend any energy on it (and this is completely human and reasonable honestly, in a lot of cases there are these external things that have hindered us, but they're never these all controlling omnipotent forces)



When someone figures out how to push someone along the stages of the therapeutic process intentionally we'll see a mental health revolution.


Developing good mental health works in the same way as developing a skill. Most people give up on their hobbies when it gets even slightly challenging.

I'm physically disabled with a genetic disorder, and further disabled by post traumatic stress disorder from CSA. Personal experience has told me stigma around disability in general is actually getting worse, and there's a lot in play. I'm also going to point out that stigma is not the sole barrier to mental healthcare.

So, why are we in a mental health crisis? 

-0 rent control = rising rent prices

-Real estate companies buying up affordable properties to flip for renting internationally, meaning lots of insecure house less folks scrambling for basic affordable shelter 

-Public mental health organizations pay therapists terribly, typically minimum wage

-Meaning that mental health professionals are not typically making enough money to *live where they're working*, and patients have less in the way of time or money to seek these services on premise. 

-This is part of what's culminated in a provider shortage; the other part is what happened to the healthcare community during COVID. Everything from communication methods to actual resources was affected. Many were angry or scared (or both) and the entire medical community took the brunt of the public's abuse. That disaster has been responsible for massive burn-out in these industries, which leads me to my next point 

-Outpatient & inpatient facilities are increasingly understaffed. Therapists are fleeing for other work or expensive private practices, which means the majority who can only afford the average land on months-long waitlists just to *meet* their therapist. I was on one for 5 months. This meant many of the people who needed and had consistent support before lost it, and have spent months (or in some places years) waiting for basic services. This also means a lot of folks therapeutic and medication routines were disrupted, which can be life threatening. It left the most vulnerable, the poor mentally ill, to fend for themselves. 

-So those folks are primarily the ones eventually landing in crisis centers as their illness spirals out. If you land at a crisis center, it's because you've been deemed an immediate danger to yourself or others, and need to be stabilized. And wards have been absolutely overwhelmed by folks involuntarily and voluntarily admitting, to the point that wards in my state were directing hospitals to dump patient overflow in nearby jails. Yeah, mentally ill folks were getting dumped in jail not for any actual crime, but because there were no beds available for them. They had to outlaw it to stop it. So imagine what's going on inside the actual crisis facilities. 

-These facilities are housing people during some of the roughest points of their lives, and they're also housing folks from the prison system who are legitimately MI or faking it to catch a break. Understaffed wards aren't just ineffective, they're dangerous because it means patients aren't being sufficiently watched or provided with the necessary levels of care, and they're somewhat commonplace at the moment. Rates of violent incidences to everyone involved - staff and patients - have shot up severely as a consequence of this internationally. So no one really wants to work for a crisis facility on premise, and patients really don't want to end up in them either. They will lie to avoid being sent to one at all costs, even when the cost/benefit outcome is poor. 

-So again, the understaffing means needs aren't being met one way or another. Crisis facilities are supposed to discharge you with a plan to enter outpatient services; there's a newer trend of poor patients being dumped without these referrals when their insurance runs out. This practice has become so common one of my local hospitals has begun reporting the facility for dumping people who clearly need continued care... But it's been to little avail. 

-Building public resentment as a result of all of these pressures. As folks mental health deteriorate in the absence of medical support, stuff can get messy. It's why we've seen an influx of ""Florida Man""-esque headlines; it all sounds amusing or weird enough at first glance, but is ultimately a sign these people are falling apart in the absence of a structured mental healthcare system and routine. And where are a lot of these people landing? Well, they can't function well enough to take care of themselves or work without medical care, so...

-The streets. At which point they are in the worst possible position to seek or receive resources of any kind because they are entirely unmedicated/unsupported. Yes, outreach services exist on premise. Guess what? Those are overwhelmed too in every possible respect. So people with PTSD, Bipolar Disorder, Major Depression, Schizophrenia, and other disorders with suicidal, depressive, and psychotic features are in the worst positions by far in this context because many of these conditions cannot be willpowered (especially in beginning stages of treatment.) In other words, those folks can't ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps,"" which makes them, naturally, public enemy number 1 to the rest of society. Further barring them from care. 

-I don't know if you've noticed, but the vitriol towards the mentally ill and homeless has totally spiraled out in cities. They're somehow all to blame for our poor living conditions and the housing crisis, and they're even worse still for not magically getting off the streets and making money, even though they're ultimately a symptom of our problems rather than the cause. Folks without severe mental illness cannot comprehend what it is like, or that it's well out of control without intervention. Which means they're regarding these people pretty awfully, leading to the uh, TikTok trends of teens attacking and stealing from homeless mentally ill for ""fun."" I wish I was joking, but that's a thing too. Stigma is alive and well, and both the homeless and the teens involved do indeed need mental healthcare they likely can't access. 

-And I could keep going, but it loops. Because if a patient gets discharged from a crisis facility with support, that support still doesn't really exist for potentially months. And if it does, there's a good chance the therapist will quit on them soon after. That's the #1 complaint you can find in a lot of online reviews for public facilities right now - all the providers keep quitting. Therapy and medication only work properly when they are consistent, which means these people spiral and avoid emergency services too. They don't get help they need, so they start bouncing off of the rest of society, and the rest of society turns on them for it. 

-To that end, it really doesn't help that the general public has weaponized therapeutic talk in inappropriate contexts. ""Don't traumadump"" means ""don't traumadump,"" not ""talking about what you're going through with a friend in any way is abusive and unfair and you should only talk to a therapist."" I'm not saying the general public should play therapists to one another. I am saying the ""I've got mine, figure your own shit out"" attitude coupled with the guilt tripping is also a component in this. People need to be able to check in with each other, and they don't even feel like they can do that right now. 

My point is that there are a wide array of sociological/economic factors culminating in the present mental health crisis, and it's far more complicated than how prevalent stigma is.",bai-rouran,1bzrfus

Kids need healthy moms & dads…..

My father raped me starting at age 3…..home was not safe nor was I protected.

Last week, I noticed how protected, safe, & loved I felt when I was hugging my priest….I noticed his masculinity (they have become father figures to me)…. And realized Dads are meant to protect and defend their children & wife….. while moms are more nurturing.

Kids need fathers who protect and defend them….. and mothers who nurture.

2) I think people are becoming too sensitive….and are too easily triggered…..

For example, I’ve been told encouraging someone to read their religious be it the Torah, the Bible, Quran, Book of Mormon, etc instead of just believing what the minister or people say causes religious trauma…. Versus I view reading the source as educating yourself on what your religion is….. but more so, there is an expectation that everyone around you needs to tip toe and not be triggering….. psych wards, trauma support groups, etc makes sense but on social media or in society in general it does not make sense. 

I deal with OCD triggers….. my friends trigger me, random person walking too closely triggers me, I trigger myself to the point of suicidal ideation….. while I’d appreciate it if my loved ones would not do my triggers but ultimately it is my trigger- I have to cope/not cope with it AND can’t expect loved ones to not trigger me….

However I will say, hospitals are solely for stabilizing patients. So it’s short term therefore you aren’t going to get the same care you would with a psychiatrist or therapist. The goal is to discharge patients as soon as they can so they can admit more. 

The therapists on site can’t treat someone in 3-12 days so they can only offer so much considering therapeutic relationships can last for months sometimes years.

15,"As a 20 years mental healthcare veteran(most of it working acute inpatient), I'd like to apologize for your experiences. I hope that, despite everything, you benefitted from your treatment in some way.

Also, let me say Thai I agree... Many people in the field aren't well equipped emotionally or professionally for the rigors of these kinds of jobs. Which is a shame for obvious reasons.

I had a couple of thoughts after reading your post, though.

First, if you or anyone is ever abused in any psychiatric setting, please contact the ombudsman and make it official. You can get this number from any staff member, and it should be provided upon admission. Protect yourself.

Second, I would need some kind of context on the crying client. There are a great deal of variables which could have been at play in that scenario. Had another client in the room expressed violent thoughts, and the staff were low key gathered to respond?(been there many times) Had staff intervened with that client beforehand?(She might have specifically told them to stay back. Yes, this happens.) Was the crying inappropriate attention seeking?(This sounds cold, but providing attention to attention seekers isn't always the answer).

Another very real possibility, though, is that the staff just weren't great.🤷

Third, I've spent enough time on units, gotten enough education and guidance, and have the sense to surmise that it would have been best to take that client aside and try to provide a more personal, if brief, experience. This would have helped her AND removed the negativity from the group. Though, again, I wasn't there.

My last thought though, is to try to take it a little easy on them. I know this sounds pedantic considering your personal experiences, but keep in mind that most of the employees you've interacted with are psych techs. Psych techs make very little, receive little to no training, often have little guidance or support, and have extremely stressful jobs. It might not seem stressful because you see them drinking coffee and playing board games, but for every 10 chill shifts like these, they will spend 1 shift providing direct care to a client twice their size, who's violent and psychotic. Most people don't understand the world of mental health until they've worked it. I once was tackled and had a turd shoved in my mouth, saw a client remove her own eyeball, and had a coworker get thrown down some stairs, snapping her leg in multiple places. That's the tip of the iceberg, but my mind tends to wander when I'm accused of being lazy and just working for the money(I'm salaried at 45k, working 50-60 hours/week, after 20 years of experience and a healthy education).

The reason so many mediocre employees work those jobs, is because there often isn't enough pay, support, or appreciation for the work to foster a competitive professional environment. So, the good ones move on to better paying, lower stress jobs. Me, I'm just wired differently. Oddly, I'm a hot commodity in my community because of my long experience, plus my record, plus my education(2 MS's), but I'm an extreme outlier.

Point is, to remedy this problem, we need to build up the importance of behavioral health treatment and develope more respect for healthcare workers like EMT's, CNA's, and Psych techs. Nurses and doctors get plenty of love, and pay. The majority of the people you've encountered, who are wiping butts, getting punched, and often carrying a lot of weight on their shoulders, just aren't. 

Again, I'm sorry you've had the experiences you've had. However, I will say that making blanket judgements about staff in an industry you don't understand, which provide life saving services, is counter productive in the big picture. 

I hope you've made a solid transition into outpatient treatment, and have solid supports, friend. Good luck.",BrooksMania,tg26l0
16,"It’s not only some health professionals that don’t understand mental health issues…it’s also the patients and other people who do not understand most (if any) mental health issues.

And yes, there are many health workers out there who are poor at their job (or have off days) just like any profession.

But here’s a new perspective: not all crying or yelling should be addressed. There are some behavioral disorders that require outbursts not be fed into with attention.

24,A lot of staff in hospitals don't have adequate training or experience. The minimum requirements for those types of jobs are just that- minimal. They also get paid shit.

I am so sorry that you had to go through something like this and, if you haven't already, I hope you find a therapist that is the right fit for you. 

Side note: do not be afraid to fire your therapist and request a new one. If you and your therapist don't mesh well, find one that will. Your mental health is much too important to abandon after 1 person. Much love to all of you ❤",MrBarriq,tg26l0
29,"You should not be suprised the whole mental health system is a joke, it’s the one that gets the leftovers of money that other services. It really needs to change, people now more than ever are depressed, have anxiety, or suffer ADHD. Also drug addiction. Bipolar disorder, Schizophrenia, suicidal ideation and suicide are big right now , I lost my 25 year old brother a month ago to suicide . He was seeing a psychiatrist and everything. But later found out adding other substances. This is so hard for me but my dad , you want believe but my dads dad killed himself on my dads 13 bday. Years later his sister walked in the woods shot herself. And then my brother and dads other son, from my stepmom he shot himself, we all are messes especially my dad and step mom. It still feels like a dream and he is still here
 But I know better. Please everyone with mental health issues and are suicidal, please think of the damage you do to your loved ones . Even things are tough think about your mom dad or cousin, friend , girlfriend, boyfriend, even your pet. After you think about it go tell someone how you are feeling and try to get some help, I know the help usually sucks but it’s all we got right now. There are ways to be seen even with little or no money. Check your state mental health services they usually work on sliding scale and if you don’t make any they still will help. Here you will see Psychiatrist and therapist maybe group therapy. But try at least, pick up phone don’t give up. I suffer major depression, anxiety, ADHD, dyslexia, top it off I was addicted to opiates for 10 years been clean 8 years now with help of doctors and medication and group, also one on one counseling. I was bad at my worst I was taking 20-25 hydrocodone a day. I have overdosed 3 times jail, stole , lied, cheated , was homeless for awhile. Now I’m 45 I’m clean but I’m happy with myself and now I’m getting to know my daughter who is 15.

30,"Yes and yes, its all true.  My grandmother always said, ""it takes more than nice to get through this world.""  She meant that nice and well meaning people don't always do a good job or do good things.  You have to be great at what you do, and unfortunately, The Bell Curve (book) tells us that only 2.1% of anyone is great at what they do, 13.7% are really good and 34.5% are average.  And this also means that 50% are below average, suck and really suck at what they do!  

I have found the mental health industry (inpatient and outpatient) filled with these same problems.  But because we are dealing with people and complicated issues, being not-so-good at what you do hurts (its like a surgeon- if you get a not-so-good one, it will hurt!).  Sadly, high quality psychotherapy and inpatient programs are expensive- very expensive, and everyone else gets the bare minimum (aka go to the hospital to make sure you don't die.  Not necessarily a place to ""get better"".).  I've known people to take out massive loans to afford high-quality treatment.

The other issue is our system of mental health care- there are huge gaps in care.  (the names are slightly different depending on your state) 

1. Acute care, locked psychiatric hospital-""we make sure you don't die or don't kill anyone else, fill you with enough meds so you don't do anything too serious after we release you; if you have really good insurance you might be able to stay for 5-8 days"".

2. Partial Hospitalization Program/Intensive outpatient- ""we just released you from the hospital and want to make sure you don't die, maybe you can learn some skills in a group, we hope you have good insurance and don't have a day job because we will see you 2-4 times per week (all day program)"".

3. Community clinic- ""we will try and help you with a therapist (whose probably an intern or pre-license) and a psychiatrist (who might have been at the bottom of their medical school class), we'll give you a case manager who might help or might not with other things. Fingers crossed!  Oh, and we don't take your insurance- you have to be on medi-cade/state insurance.""

4. Private Individual psychotherapist- ""I might take your insurance, but you'll have to go through 5 of me before you find one you think helps.  Or, I don't take your insurance, but I'm fucking good which is why I'm $200-$350 per 45 min session.""

5. Private specialized treatment program (30-90 days for anything- substance use, personality disorders, anxiety, depression, bipolar... although not many for psychotic disorders- they usually end up in the local community mental health system unfortunately)- ""we are all quite good at what we do and your chances of getting better here are more than anywhere else, but we cost a fuck-ton- 20-50k Per MONTH, so really only super wealthy people come here, so sad too bad you can't afford us.""  

For the rest of us- keep trying- there are high quality amazing professionals in all the mental health places, they just may be a bit harder to find :)",Onlydoc,tg26l0

Let's be real tho and say doctors that phone it in are half the issue. I have gone with a person who has heard voices for a long time to a shrink, and I was in the room for support. Each time the person came back they'd realize there was something they probably should have mentioned the last time or should have said differently (they are extremely precise when it comes to words, it can be frustrating in conversation), so they'd say this new thing. Like trying to explain anxiety or whatever. And after like 3 visits they got a letter in the mail saying the doctor didn't believe them. So they're just dealing with it with no help. It's a whole mess of problems.",karmakist,eceho0
33,"My brother and I had a very traumatic childhood and both suffer from multiple mental health issues as a result. We both have a pretty dark sense of humor so there’s definitely jokes about it in conversations between he and i. It’s funny that you compare it to putting it on social media as if it’s something on a resume. Because for example, my brother once was filling out a job application and it said to list traits about yourself, and he jokingly said “paralyzing self doubt, debilitating PTSD, ability to see the silver lining in my lust for death” he was obviously kidding and just said it out loud to me because I was there while he was filling it out as his house, but he would never say it if there was anyone else around besides me, and I also wouldn’t joke about it if anyone else was around. And we don’t post about it on social media. Neither of us are “self-diagnosed.” I’ve heard a friend joke once when someone asked where his dad was (his dad left him as a child) and he said “he’s at the store, he should be back soon, he left about 17 years ago.” I think it’s similar to that. Is it appropriate? Maybe not. But some people cope with things through humor or making light of things. Probably the same thing for some people who act like it’s a quirk. I’m sure you’re right about some people- I do think some people get nervous sometimes and decide they suffer from “anxiety” because they want attention or for it to sound more serious. But I don’t know that I’d just decide anyone who acts like that doesn’t actually have any mental illnesses. Or that every single person in the world with a mental illness wouldn’t want anyone to know. Everyone is different I guess. I can see how it could be frustrating if it’s what you’re going through and you see someone trivializing it or making light of the same issue. But on the other hand I think it’s kind of refreshing how a lot of people now feel like they can say “I have depression” as easily as they could say “I have a broken leg.” I think it’s helping to end the stigma that mental health issues have to be a secret, and is probably making younger generations feel more comfortable reaching out for help.",musihn01,eceho0

I've seen people who don't like having people post things that are positive because it makes them feel more broken and others who appreciate it because it makes them feel uplifted.

Also, since you deleted your posts for some reason:

You should try to read some of the answers of a bunch of posts here and on r/bpd with an emotional distance. My personal experience with mental illness makes it really hard to think otherwise. I usually have a calm discussion with X if I think they misuse ""anxiety, depressed"" but lets be honest, its also fine to misuse words or to exaggerate how you feel. We do it all the timeeeeee. I mean i have yet to see someone getting mad over "" that gave me cancer "".

&#x200B;

i think some people tend to forget that we(not all) have some cognitive distortions and we often don't see the reality as it is. as a teenager i used to be straight up delusional and i'd also be mad when someone used depressive when they apparently weren't cause I really wanted to kms and would think no one understood me and they clearly didn't really know how it feels like. That anger left as I grew up and with therapy though.",AtlanteanDoll,eceho0
146,"My point is you've got a clear case of cognitive dissonance between two beliefs. The belief that it is ok for you to say that you are (this disorder) and the belief that you would not refer to yourself as something offensive even though they were labels pertaining to a particular diagnosis. 

You don't realize the implication these have when it comes to psychotherapy. You have to realize that symptoms of a mental disorder should not necessarily define what the person is and what the person can become. To say that you are this and you are that, you would put yourself in a position that you would not accept yourself for who you really are with or without the symptoms. 

Would you tell the oncologist that ""I am cancer?"" It is the very same thing, unless you are into astrology.

No one can fix mental illness in my opinion with a conversation, at the end of the day I kinda had to accept things how they are take some responsibility and have realistic expectations. Don't get me wrong having compassionate support along the way is huge, it's a lot more helpful from someone who has experienced something similar. At times I also don't think I was capable of taking responsibility and being as active in my recovery as I am now. Think in the depths of depression or after trauma.

3,"I am sorry to hear that. And I wish someday humanity can take away this horrible parasitic thing. 

People don’t understand coolness of mental health is either 1. Result of horrible portrayal of mental illness on media just like literally everything else (I mean almost everything is portrayed horribly on media). 2. A result of the real person behind the illness. 

At least the illed people I know, their warmth and coolness are radiating from themselves rather than the illness that’s plaguing around them. And I just wanna tell any kids who think mental illness is cool to know that mental illness isn’t the cool thing, the people are. Getting mental illness doesn’t make you cool in another word. 

The same goes in reverse, mental illness isn’t your cool. For the people suffering who’s wondering why people are still around them, it’s the beautiful and interesting soul that cannot be covered by the grimed by the illness that’s emanating and attracting people. People simply can’t ignore the beautiful you beyond the horrible clouds around you. You are so so much more than your illness.

And that’s exactly what I mean thank you. I totally understand that there’s time when someone who’s ill simply can’t take up responsibility due to their illness. It’s part of it and totally valid and it’s an information that the world try to promote and educate people. But among all these information I think there lacked a guide for other people how to perceive it, or may be it’s just that I can’t read between lines. 

For example, the negativity in “the negativity is hard for others to bear” isn’t really talking the depressive thoughts. But rather their anger directed to you that they just can’t control sometimes. And “It’s their illness talking” is as much as a statement to tell that what they say isn’t in their control as a statement to tell the listener to don’t take it by heart. And it may feel disrespectful to illed people’s voice and invalidating them but it is a thing to keep in mind when something like these happen. It allows you to step back and not engage. It simply isn’t very possible to take everything they lashed out by heart and too seriously while being considerate and not take a toil on you, at least not for a significant portion of people. 

I wish someone had told me much more directly these things. It would’ve made this journey way less painful. Mental illness is ugly and horrible and a total b*tch. There’s no denying. Romanticising it or just trying to beat around bushes isn’t helping. It makes mental illness looks good and just redirects the blame for the horrible things it cause the person to do back to the person. 

I wish my friend would understand that there’s ugly mist surrounding her, and it’s truth it’s ugly and it still isn’t her fault. And even though I may not be able to give the most ideal response and take everything she said to heart. There exists and I still see the perfect and beautiful her beyond all the horrible mist clouding her. And I wish everyone, suffering or not, to understand mental illness isn’t them.

Anyhow, one of the things I’d recommend is maybe go out on a drive. Sometimes nowhere in particular is a good thing to do. It helps me clear my mind and focus on something fun to do.

I also cannot stress “soul searching trips” enough. Certainly with COVID it might be tough to pack up and go somewhere for a few days, but maybe that is what you need. In March, on the literal same weekend, I am going back to where I was when COVID became a big deal/shutting stuff down. In an effort to do the stuff I couldn’t when I was there last year.

Social isolation is rough. If you have any online games you like or want to try, consider posting on the game forums looking for a group to play and chat with. You could also post in your city/town's subreddit and mention that you're looking for friends. I found a friend because I saw a post like this. You can get to know each other online and when this is over you could meet in person. 

Do you have any hobbies you like? If you do, my counselor's advice might help you, and focusing on them is a good distraction from the craziness on social media. I have lots of projects and despite all the time I had I was unmotivated and wasn't working on any of them. My counselor suggested having one goal a day. You don't want to overdo it and burn yourself out all over again. At one point I said ""I think I'm going to work on short stories next week,"" and she said ""what about just one story?"" And I did just that, and I submitted that story to a contest. It was the first time I submitted anything.

Back in the fall I was bouncing back from my bad spring & summer but around the beginning of winter many things in my life changed so I’m at a worse place now than I was in the spring. There’s many factors I think are contributing to it such as:
- hybrid learning got canceled and bc of my adhd I can’t do at home learning so I essentially shut down and don’t do anything, once I decided I had to get my grades up the amount of work had built up so much that I got into a depressive state(which is weird for me bc I usually do get some seasonal depression but this time around it’s different and more intense, I haven’t had a dry eyed day in over a week).
- my therapist went on maternity leave which I thought would last till February but apparently it’s longer
- my household is dysfunctional 
- my social anxiety has gotten pretty bad again, I’ve kept it under control the past few years but staying inside limiting my interaction with too many people has allowed my social anxiety to resurface at a level I haven’t had in a long time 
- there’s so many college decisions and that is making me become even more prone to shutting down as it adds a different element into the mix along with my schoolwork and job

I’m starting hybrid learning again tomorrow but I don’t know if I’ll be able to make it through the day, I guarantee I’ll sob cry for at least 1/2 an hour with the in school therapist I’ve forced myself to test out and then I’ll be self conscious about looking like I’d cried. My worst fear is I’ll start balling when a teacher asks me about all my late work(I have horrible emotional regulation as a symptom of my adhd so balling my eyes out in school isn’t that far fetched of a fear to have, I’ve actually done it before and I hated it).

I used jiu-jitsu as a mental health care provider and obviously it being an extremely close contact sport, I've been out of a gym to go to. That hour and 15 every other day is now gone.

Although I am still working, I only work with the public and co-workers twice a week. Most weeks I'm only working with one co-worker per day because of drastically reduced business. Over the past year, my wife has been about my only source of face to face social contact. One of the ways this manifests its self is I over-engage when I have a chance for conversation.

Beyond that, I've noticed that negative information seems to be having a disproportionate impact on me. Specifically the accumulation of 'crap' from work and financial issues related to having my income cut.

I have also noticed a decline in cognitive function, especially as it relates to short term memory. More instances of 'going to the kitchen and forgetting why'. I don't know whether this is just the progression of aging, the effect of being out of my normal routine for nearly a year, or a lingering side effect from having Covid back in November.

40,"I'm not sure if you are spiritual at all. However, I truly believe there are great benefits within spiritual practice that can help mental health, regardless of whether or not you believe in spirituality. 

In the spiritual (how many times can I say spiritual?) world, there is a phenomenon known as 'the dark night of the soul' - you might have heard about it already. But to put it briefly; a dark night of the soul is a stage of spiritual awakening where one reaches rock bottom before finally re-emerging into a more fulfilling life. 

It's been said that currently the world is undergoing a similar process as we enter, from the Ago of Pisces, into the Age of Aquarius. This could explain why the world is kind of, to put it bluntly, going to shit? I know so many people who are in a similar position to yourself currently. And rightly so, considering the state we're in at the moment! (Every corner of life seems to hit us with something to feel negative about). 

However, that doesn't mean we all need to feel like crap, and there are definitely ways in which we can improve our mental health even during times of crisis. 

One way I recommend, which has helped me immensely, is journaling. If you don't like writing you could also; audio record, film yourself or draw/paint your thoughts. It's so refreshing to release everything going on in my head and once it's out there, you can begin to decipher your thoughts and emotions in a way as if you were somebody else. It's like, you know when someone else is feeling down you have all the answers for them, but none for yourself when you feel the same? Well, this way, you can treat it like your emotions are not your own and then offer up ways to help. 

Some other ways that have been helping me is being more intentional in my life and also connecting more to nature. I'm aware this reply is quite long and you might not want to read a huge block of text, so I've included links to a couple of articles I've written on these subjects if you wanted to understand them further. There's also some tips about how to start journalling if that's something you're interested in. 

Anyway, I really hope things can start to look up for you! I wish you all my best and \*hopefully\* I was able to help in some way or another. <3

A few months ago (nowadays, kind of, maybe not really), I sort of got involved in conspiracy stuff, just looking it up and reading it.

It made me really anxious and everything; there's lots of bad stuff in the world and the thought of there being more bad stuff that's hushed up kind of gets me stressed.

Best advice I can give you is going to sound utterly trite and useless but do not get stuck in a rut, and should you find yourself in a rut, do everything possible to get out of it. Depression is the kind of thing that puts you in a hole then contrives to keep you there for so long that eventually you just accept it. And then the hole gets deeper.

But I always like to say that if you’re comfortable around someone and have always felt safe talking with them. That is usually your gut telling you they’re ok.

I have a manager at work, I will call him C. Most of the mangers at my job treat me like I am an idiot or that all I can do is be a tall, bulky guy who can be the fall guy to do all the heavy lifting, laborious tasks they would pass on. Ive talked to HR about seeing if they can mix up who does tasks like this I am consistently in a world of pain outside of work due to having to pull different stuff. I even struggle to breathe some days because of the winter months messing with my lungs.

Anyhow, in my job, I have this manager C who has really been there for me. Granted, I’ve been there longer than he has, but he has really been there when I needed to talk to him. I think he’s only a few years older than I am, but just we put up with a lot of the same BS so he knows what I am going through, and it just is nice to get to vent off of each other.

I’d say the key in finding someone to open up to is that you need to tell someone you trust what I call “low risk information.” This could be as simple as something you did in grade school you’re guilty about in hindsight. Or telling them about why you do a small personality/personal idiosyncrasy you are known for. That way, you can see how they react and if they react well.

3,You and your doctors know more about what’s best for you than random people’s opinions. And everyone’s mental health matters not just yours so screw people who tell you otherwise or try to diminish how you feel and think. If they’re not going to be supportive than they probably aren’t a great advocate for your mental health and if your mental health is hurting others than you’re not an advocate for them either. What I have learned is to not hold onto things or people when it’s not working out. Nothing has to end ugly it just means it’s not working and you need to move on for your benefit or others. You should never beg or ask for acceptance. You will know who the right people are when they come along.,Pokkiiphias,1b0ksvq

quarantine wasn’t helping either, i was struggling that i didn’t leave my room. sometimes, it was my bed. i was just in a really bad place and thoughts were spiking. i also got into arguments with my mom who did nothing but blamed me for my own feelings. as the years went on, i had finally realized that at a time like this. no one was able to help me but *me*. and i finally started to change my mindset.

my journey was not perfect as it should be, i’ve had my decline in mental health. but i didn’t let that stop me from improving. i kept going, i did my best to change my mindset. i stopped looking towards unhealthy habits and self sabotaging despite how comforting it always was. it’s been almost an entire year or around a year of being clean.

everyday, i tell myself that “i can do this”. because if today wasn’t a good day, there is always tomorrow. and that tomorrow could be full of many memorable moments. i’m not giving up because what if i lose a chance at something big tomorrow? i’ve learned many things and it changed me for the better.",victoriangoth_,1b0ksvq

They told a teacher and I got sent to the guidance counselor during that day. She also called my mom who bitched her out. When I got home my mom was angry with me and told me something along the lines of “what are you doing telling people that? Do you want them to lock you up?” I don’t think I talked about any mental health issues I was having after that. 

The second time was when I got into cutting in my teenage years. I started on my forearm and I think it was the deep cut I did. My mom saw and grabbed my arm and gave me the same talk about being locked up if people saw. So I stopped cutting on my forearm and moved to places people wouldn’t see.

Well, I'm 17 now. Diagnosed with depression at 10. Spent years being bullied for being ""sensitive"" and a ""crybaby."" I got meds, they worked. 13, I began SH because of a really bad bully. This girl was legitimately insane and loved hurting me. Called me names, tripped me often, told me I was terrible, told me to kms. 
I seriously contemplated s**cide. COVID made me realize I wanted to be there for my family, so.. I stayed. The bullying only stopped bc of COVID. I'm almost certain I had post-traumatic stress. Ended up having horrific nightmares about the bullying for 2 years. The nightmares usually depicted me being tortured or hunted by my bully or hurting my friends. Sometimes it was manifesting the things she told me I was. There were nights where I couldn't sleep in my own bed, because I was terrified of having another nightmare, so I fell asleep on the kitchen tile. I didn't really fully heal from that experience until I was 16. I also developed some amnesia and don't remember much of being 13. I just remember the traumatic parts. I'm still processing how to deal with that. I've been clean for 4 years. I became much stronger emotionally. I don't get bullied anymore. I'm about to graduate which I something 13 year old me never thought I would do. I'm proud of how far I've come.

I learned to define my own self worth by myself, not by what others think of me. My trauma matters and it doesn't define me. People's words are just that: words. Nothing more.

I couldn’t go to sleepovers without having a panic attack until I was 13. When I was 12 my parents divorced and it was one of the things that contributed to my depression, my anxiety started to get really bad and I missed almost 2 months off school because of abdominal pains that doctors thought could be appendicitis. I went to counselling for the anxiety and it didn’t help, I then tried counselling again with a different counsellor and I found it helped a little more. My depression hasn’t gone away since it started and I’ve had a couple of psychotic episodes since, in the past couple of years I’ve developed bulimia and I’m currently on the waitlist to go back to counselling in the hopes that they can put me on antidepressants now that I’m older

24,"A few defining moments or periods for me. Warning, I mention I few pretty rough things here, so be prepared or keep scrolling:


- 0-4. Born to parents who should never have been allowed to have kids. Both seemingly stopped developing mentally once they hit their teens. Learnt that my mother couldn't be trusted, and that my father would only hurt me more if I went to him with my problems. ""boys don't cry"" and all that. They did a lot of good, but they fucked up a lot of things too 


- CSA between ages 4 and 6. My parents were useless and I knew I couldn't go to them for help. One of my most vivid memories from this time is going to my room and locking myself in there alone, because I knew if I just had time by myself, I could make it through what had been happening. Deeply sad to look back on. I'm not sure what I'd do if I went back and met that kid - hug him or put him out of his misery. No child should have to bear that alone because they know their parents are too immature to be trusted with knowing

- the ""dark ages"", 6 to ~16. Severely underweight for a decade straight. Pathetic parents who built a home environment that was a source of constant trauma. I'm missing large chunks of memory from this period

- a switch, 16 to 18. Went from almost anorexic (I'm convinced I would've been diagnosed with it if I was a girl - I weighed 30kg at 5'10) to overeating. Looking back, I think I was slowly slipping out of the autopilot I spent the precious decade in, and had no idea how to cope

- university, 18-22. Made friends for the first time. I'd never really let anyone into my life before this. I miss those years in a lot of ways now, looking back. This is also where I started to struggle more openly - I bucked the trend I'd set with excellent academic record and started to have to really work to stay afloat during uni. I generally managed, though

- Age 22. Final year of uni. This is when my memories of the CSA came flooding back. Right after COVID - I guess being around my parents day after day for 2 years during lockdowns finally pushed me past my limits. Very difficult year. Flashbacks every few minutes, all day long. Hallucinations. Nightly sleep paralysis. It felt like my brain was torturing me. Fun times

- 23-24. Moved out straight after uni. The PTSD got a lot better. I'm doing much worse in other ways, but I think that's because I finally have the space and time to unravel. And yeah, I'm unravelling. Hit deep burnout last year. Been trying to keep moving and avoid that slump since then. On antidepressants too, which help somewhat

- the future. Not sure what to expect. I'm only still here because I never had the balls to end it. I hate the thought of leaving people who care about me behind, hurt and wishing they could've done something. So I'm here, still existing today just because I woke up this morning. I have no serious hopes for the future - if I could click a button and have my friends and siblings forget I ever existed, I'd do it and finally pick up the phone that's been ringing my whole life. That's been true since I was a teenager.

Until someone invents that though, I'm still here and am trying to live decently - I have hobbies and live alone so I can be myself without judgement. I truly love that feeling. I try not to hurt people, and to help them when I get a chance and am capable of it. Aside from that, I'm just waiting to finally rest. I've been waiting for that for damn near 20 years.

27,"TW:mentions of abuse and suicide

I started having ptsd symptoms when I was 12. My family basically refused to acknowledge it. But now my mother says she “knew something was wrong”. So she was either negligent by not doing anything or negligent because she was so checked out she didn’t notice. I am also autistic, but I have never sought a diagnosis for a variety of reasons (my mother hates neurodivergence, $$, and it gives doctors even more ammo to not listen or take me seriously).

I was misdiagnosed with adhd when I was 16. My mother tried to medicate me because it annoyed her that I procrastinated eventhough I always finished by my deadlines. 

I finally went to therapy at 20 even though I was terrified. My boss at school threatened to fire me if I didn’t. I loved my job (it was a special interest) so I would have done anything to keep it even endure her emotional abuse.

A year later, she fired me anyway with absolutely no grounds and used campus safety to do it. She told them I was suicidal (I was not and had litterally just come from therapy, which she knew). My school basically told me everything was my fault and tried to kick me out but were unsuccessful since I kept up my grades. 

I rapidly lost weight due to stress. So I was given an emergent appointment with a psychiatrist. I was put on 2 different meds and I passed out from those overnight leading to a concussion (my doc did warn me it could lower blood pressure and to be careful I just forgot). This only worsed my mental health because I was basically only allowed to lay in the dark. No good distractions, no nothing. In the next 6 months I volentarily hospitalized 4 times. I never attempted. But this is how/why my mother found out. I never wanted to tell her, but I couldn’t afford mounted expenses of more and more therapy, psychatrist, meds, etc without insurance and without a job. I only stayed alive out of spite because I knew the school would twist it into something that was “inevitable”, not something that they directly caused. 

Soon after my therapist left, so I found a new (shitty therpist) and spun my wheels for a year. Right as covid was starting, I met my current therapist. My health took a nose dive aroundt his time too, which very much affected my mental health. It was hard to even get out of bed and my doctors weren’t listening at all. Took 3 years and $10,000 to discover I have an easily detectible (and treatable) thyroid condition that my docs already knew ran in my family. But they kept giving my lectures about my mental health and dandruff. And yes your thyroid can affect mental health. 

Took me 2 and a half years to disclose any trauma to my therapist. I still can’t say much outloud. I started emdr and exposure therapy in august. I didn’t do great with emdr because I dissociate really easily. So we are taking a break from that. She has been extremely patient and understanding with my preference for writing hard things. We are working on verbalizing it, but we have a really good balance of her pushing me a bit past my comfort but still listening to me (and my cues) when something is too far right now.

I don’t know if I believe my symtoms will ever totally go away, but now it at least feels like it can get a bit better, a bit easier. I know I will always have a lot of vulnerabilities and be sensitive, for lack of a better word. I just haven’t really come to terms with that yet.",FriendlyFoundation47,1b0ksvq

31,"I cant know where to start. A history of traumas and multiple comorbid conditions.

Can never forget my first abusive romantic experience .

My first manic episode. And how my episodes became worse over time. From pure episodes to psychotic episodes.

My horrible medication experience made me stop medications. And refuse medications

But when I found the right meds, I realized meds in some conditions are not luxury, but a necessity for recovery especially in severe mental illness like bipolar or schizophrenia. I felt normal for the first time in years on a med that worked for me. And realized modern medicine is a life saver, that my illness is as real as gravity and not woo woo.

My bachelor in psychology changed my view a lot. I now know that I should not approach hard drugs because I will never be the same again. From study and from witnessing addicts. You will never heal fully from drug abuse once you get hooked. 

Me becoming friends with a diagnosed borderline person made me realize I had quiet BPD. I started recognizing my relationship pattern and emotional promiscuity. And awareness is an important part of change.

Life taught me that you should be your own best friend. YOU will always have your back. Nothing is ever guaranteed. Even the most loyal person can leave you by death!! You will be with you for the entire journey. So fix that relationship!!!! Build yourself up. Codependency on people only brought me suffering!!! It is just a drug to avoid facing your emotions and trauma.

My first convulsive seizure and later diagnosis with epilepsy after a history of non convulsive seizures … caused me to have more compassion for myself. I stopped blaming myself completely when I realized mental and neurological conditions are as real as gravity. They are caused by complex and dynamic factors and can happen to anyone. It is not my fault ! I did not make myself ill. Was a wonderful realization when I learned more about the neurobiological basis of my illnesses.

Every toxic and non toxic person taught me new things and aided in my self discovery.
We learn everyday !!

Workbooks and somatic work are priceless. CBT is effective and not luxury. Invest every penny. Mental health is health. 

Do not feel ashamed for needing assistance or help your entire life. For me, I would need lifelong follow ups. That is okay. We do not say the same thing if someone who is diabetic is following up with their doctor. It is a chronic illness and needs constant follow up, and so are many mental disorders.

Find a main doctor, and have other experts on the side.. that is what I learned. Doctor shopping gave me a 360 view of my condition, as each psychologist or doctor has their own perspective or philosophy on things. Seeing many opinions helps you reach a full and thorough understanding.


I also think I should reach a point in my recovery where I can sometimes compartmentalize mental illnesses aside and LIVE. Mental illness is not an identity. We are more than our pathology. And not everything we do is a “symptom”. Even if much of our behavior is impacted by illness, we are still humans who are entitled to have an emotional experience even if it is abnormal.

Your love is not pathology if you are borderline. It is still love but you have to work on your attachment style.

Just because you have a mood disorder does not mean your anger is always invalid. You have the right to be angry. Just channel it healthily and right.

Have a meaningful purpose. We do not live forever. And keep pushing till you die.

I lost my healthy state, peace, and happiness. Perhaps friendships and time.

But I gained wisdom, experience, and purpose. It is bittersweet.",Ihopeitllbealright,1b0ksvq

33,"My mental health was honestly pretty good for most of my life. I didn’t have any depressive episodes, didn’t see a therapist or psych. I was 37 in 2019 and married with a young daughter, had a pretty solid career etc.

However my marriage was abusive and I was in pretty deep denial about it until I learned he was doing the same thing to other women including two of my friends. He confessed some of it and the rest, the women came out publicly. The next few weeks were focused on getting divorce papers together and seeing a lawyer. He had always been deeply opposed to using a condom and I got tested - he had infected me with Hep C (though I had cleared it) - I had to hold my crying daughter while they took her blood because they were unsure whether I had it while I was pregnant. (She tested clear.) Every step of the process of separating was horrific.

I knew the day I left him that it would be hard  mental health wise. I went to a walk in clinic. The therapist immediately picked up that he was abusive and at high risk of violence and the next few weeks of therapy were focused on prioritizing my safety while leaving.

We had been together for around 15 years. It was like the dam had broken on the fear I had buried during the marriage. Facing the realities of what he had done to others forced me to confront the abuse he had imposed on me. I felt guilt, like somehow I should have been able to stop what he did to other women. Combined with the constant fear and hypervigilance around leaving, I couldn’t sleep, had vivid dreams and started to become paranoid. In three weeks after my separation, I had lost over 30 pounds. My therapist saw I was deteriorating rapidly and referred me to a psychiatric NP to get a prescription but she didn’t have any openings for several months.

Finally I had a full-on PTSD episode at 1am one night. I called 911 with delusions that I had a psychic link with my ex and he going to murder me. After that call, I recognized that this was bigger than I could handle alone. I checked myself into the psych emergency department. They admitted me, I stayed for around a week and was diagnosed with Acute Stress Disorder which was later changed to PTSD. At the hospital I did get to see a psych and they gave me Zoloft.

When Covid hit the following March 2020, I had a lot of work stress, isolation, COVID related stress and parenting my three-year-old daughter alone. I did my best to hold it together but sank back into depression and decompensated. I became insomniac and delusional again and ended up back in the psych ward for a week in June.

After that, I continued to recover in spurts. I started EMDR. I did well for a year and a half but decompensated again in February 2022 after a lot of work stress. I did not sleep for six days and experienced all kinds of emotional flashbacks at 1am. As the sleep deprivation progressed, I became paranoid and delusional. I was so deeply affected that I made three different “final plans”, and was unable to carry any of them out because my thought process was so compromised by lack of sleep. On day seven of not sleeping, I turned myself back in to the psych emergency room and they admitted me. 

Within a few months after that, I made some life changes. I enrolled in a psychology degree, because as awful as my experience had been, it was fascjnating to watch from the inside. I changed jobs since my old one was creating too much opportunity for stress and isolation (it was a good move). And I started volunteering on a suicide hotline, kind of figuring that having been there might give me an empathetic edge.

In November 2022, someone confessed their love for me and asked me on a date. It set off my PTSD in a way I hadn’t experienced and I immediately fell into a cycle of not sleeping, losing weight, becoming paranoid, etc.

But this time, I was determined not to get to suicidality and not to go back to the hospital. I had made a safety plan and I followed it - I took a couple days off work, I stayed with family, I had a rigid schedule with walks and meals and meditation, I upped my appointments with my therapist, and I got over the acute phase of it in around a week.

After I recovered, I was really frustrated with my medication. I was on the maximum dose of Zoloft. What was the point of this if it doesn’t prevent depressive episodes? I had had more episodes on the medication than off. I decided to try to stop taking it, being careful to observe my own reaction. My personal results were that I experienced zero withdrawal symptoms and zero downturn in mood. It was as though I had been taking a sugar pill. To this day, around 1.5 years later, I have been fully stable without medication. I know medication is necessary for a lot of people. I just want to emphasize, I’m not advocating going off medication, it just worked out ok for me. I suspect it may not have been useful for me because I was recovering from more trauma and less underlying brain pathology. I do have a couple of PRN medications for sleep and anxiety and use them just once every couple of months.

I'm really blessed to have a comprehensiv and loving people in my life. One day, I was in a very bad mental shape, m'y wife told me she could not help me anymore. And I went to a psychiatrist my mum told me about. She diagnosed me with bipolar disorder (type 2), put me on medication (it took a while to find the right treatment). I struggle sometimes with my mental health but it is wayyyyyy better and manageable ❤️",juachem,1b0ksvq
36,"I was born with an innate desire to succeed. As an elementary school student, I was diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD, and bullied for being overweight. As the bullying continued in 6th grade, I eventually developed anorexia. Therapy was unhelpful, so I got into weightlifting with the goal to rebuild my body in a healthy manner. These impediments only further fueled my drive to set and achieve exceptional goals. Starting as young as 7 years old, I used this tenacity to compete internationally in sailboat racing with my eyes on the Olympics. At the age of 18, I was one of the top sailors in North America and placed 3rd in a double-handed sailboat race from Newport, RI to Bermuda. Additionally, I was one of the youngest individuals to take community and business leadership roles within my hometown. Looking into the future, I only saw one direction, and that was forward.
This drive for success continued into my college career, but it started to warp into unhealthy perfectionism. During my sophomore year at the University of Pennsylvania, while staying determined to reach my goals regardless of the cost, I hit a breaking point. Having sacrificed my health and social life to achieve a 4.0 GPA, I now found myself burned out, deeply depressed, and developed suicidal thoughts. In spite of this internal reality, I continued pushing myself to compete in a collegiate national sailing event. Throughout the race, doing the one thing that always brought me tranquility and joy, all I could think about were ways to end my life. This is when I knew something had to change.
My world, once so goal-oriented and filled with success, started spiraling downward. This unforgiving darkness forced me to make the difficult decision to leave college. In addition, I had to step away from training, and thus my dream to sail in the Olympics. As time passed, so too did the opportunity of achieving my professional goal of becoming a doctor. My hopes of a future and having a family evaporated, and my days left me feeling as if I were stuck in quicksand. I isolated myself in my room for months. Fear of taking my own life led to multiple hospital self-admissions, which only gave way to being discharged to an array of unhelpful residential facilities. Rather than resolving my inner pain, I found myself addicted to anything that would ease the suffering. Desperate for some resolution to my internal torment, I turned to Electroconvulsive Therapy, praying it would shock the depression out of me. Over time, I was left with no choice but to go on disability, as this condition had left me debilitated and unable to work. I felt ashamed, alone, judged, and defeated.
Regardless of how much adversity I faced, I never gave up. I knew that each new day brought some small degree of hope. After seeking out top professionals, who either told me my condition would never improve or felt they had the magical diagnosis that if treated “properly” would offer hope, I knew the system was broken. Over a few years, I was given diagnoses that included major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, borderline personality disorder, negative symptoms of schizoaffective disorder, autism, severe ADHD, and other diagnoses, which were created mostly to make that practitioner feel competent within their professional field. With a broken system, I knew I needed to look within myself for the answers I sought.
I found the grit to make changes in my life to break free of depression’s dark heavy chains and I began focusing on what was within my control. This involved incorporating fitness, nutrition, meditation, structure, community, and positive psychology into my daily routine. I turned to natural supplements to minimize prescription medication, utilized light therapy, and cut out caffeine, ADHD stimulants, and other chemicals. In addition, I developed a consistent sleep and wake schedule to prioritize proper recovery. I understood that prior to working on my psychological well-being, it was essential to optimize my biology, and my body’s own innate desire to function and heal itself.
Recognizing that a miracle would not happen overnight, I began focusing on marginal gains in the hope of my brain rewiring itself after months, and in some cases, years, of healthy habits. I held on to my helm with a firm grip, pointed my boat in one direction, and never looked back. Through much determination and sheer grit, my hope started to become a reality.
Over the last several years, I have been free of living in a pitch-black, lonely world. I still battle aspects of depression, but they are manageable through my efforts to create purpose in helping others, take minimal medication, do daily fitness, and welcome wellness, love, and hope into my life.
As an entrepreneur, a crucial catalyst in elevating my confidence and building success was the decision to face my fear of failure that had become imprinted through the years. I decided to say yes to all professional and personal opportunities that crossed my path. I began to understand that nothing is a true failure as long as you learn from it and that the most successful people have had moments of great victory and brutal defeat. Since overcoming the severity of my depression, I have competed professionally as an athlete, started multiple businesses, and helped countless people accomplish incredible goals. I have consulted on multi-million dollar deals, advised large companies, made successful angel investments, and I have had the pleasure of meeting amazing, inspirational individuals.
Most importantly, through my own personal journey, and my extensive research in understanding optimal wellness, sustainability, and both cognitive and physical elite performance, I have developed an intense passion and sense of purpose for helping others. As the founder of Wisch Fit and executive coach and peak performance coach, I have guided others in overcoming barriers through physical, mental, and professional growth. My mission is to help people realize that no goal is too big or outrageous and that anything is ultimately possible with the right knowledge, tools, and support.",HealthIsWealth33,1b0ksvq

Where you bullied? Emotionally neglected? 

If everything there seems normal, have you looked into if it’s something more health related? Are you eating well? Staying hydrated? Spending time outside?

Because I was depriving my body of important nutrients that help balance happy hormones.

The fact that you’re not stressed or struggling and still are facing these symptoms is pretty much confirmation that something is up.

Go to a psychiatrist and counselor. They will help you figure out what is going on, what you can fix through mindfulness and behavioral changes, whether medication is right for you and what the best way is to make you more comfortable.

I never exactly felt understood, but also, what else are you supposed to do when your kid is coming up to you with drama about how her friend has multiple anime girl personalities (didn't have DID, we read about it and went oh we act so different around different people! And ended up in this weird roleplay thing, it's terrible and we shouldn't have done that but we were 11) and I cried about her evil personality taking over. Like as a parent wtf do you say to that. Every time I cry I'm told to stop being so sensitive or dramatic, to stop taking things to heart, that I need thicker skin. And honestly it's true, I do need thicker skin. I've always had a weird case with friendships, I'd always get very attached to one or a few people and then just... Not give a fuck about anyone else? Unless I felt rejected, then I'd give a fuck and cry about how awful and worthless I am. But my first real friend, everything kinda went to shit with her after a whole debacle with her sending me pics of her cutting herself and blaming it on me and saying she was gonna throw herself in front of the train that went by her house if I didn't do what she wanted so big oof right there.

After that I was pretty much alone and turned to the Internet where I used different fandoms and groups to fill my social needs. I am VERY chronically online. I'd always bring my problems to these people, seek attention and validation from them, feel so good when I was the saddest, most pitiful one, and then they'd get tired of me and I'd move somewhere else. Rinse and repeat till I met my friend Momo. Something was different about her. I don't know why, I don't know what happened, but something just pulled me under and I became obsessed with her. With talking to her all the time every single day, we've known eachother just over a year and have over 250k messages, I don't go a single day without her. I fell for her so deeply to the point where I couldn't see her as human anymore, she felt like some perfect, unfeeling goddess, the answer to all my problems, the one who'd always tell me I AM enough and that it IS bad enough, so I drug her through it over and over and over again just to feel that validation and attention to the point where she's breaking down herself now and I had no idea she could even feel this bad over me.

It’s great that you recognize and are grateful for the lucky straw you drew regarding your material circumstance, but that doesn’t mean you’re undeserving of help and (should you request it) treatment.

People (including myself, haha) can feel envious of your station, but that doesn’t mean you don’t deserve to be healthy and happy, just like everyone else. 

I have a friend who is very well off materially and familally (is that a word?), same as you, and he ended up reaching out for help in his early twenties. He’s bipolar. He’s rich, fantastic family life, and he’s also bipolar. Happens to anyone. I’m so happy he felt safe enough to reach out to his friends and family for help when it started to affect his quality of life, and got a diagnosis.

It’s not selfish or throwing money around to seek help.

You deserve treatment like anyone else, therefore you're allowed to use the resource.

Mental illness can be purely brain chemistry based, but I also want to maybe prompt you to look at complex-ptsd and emotional neglect, as I've known a decent number of folks with 'good on paper' backgrounds where their physical needs where met and they were never financially precarious, but emotional needs weren't, and money was used for leverage and control. 'Trauma' isn't just what does happen, it's what doesn't happen too. I was told so often that I had it better than other people, so what was done to me was 'normal'. It wasn't normal.

Privilege works as a statistical/population thing, but is clunky on an individual level.

Having needs met in one area doesn't cancel out something else being neglected.",shellontheseashore,18v4st0

People with a diagnosed DSM-V condition are not the only people who need help sometimes.

43,"I think it’s really important for parents to validate emotions coming from their child. Even if the emotions seems silly. Because it’s not silly to the kid. And it’s a perfect time to teach the kid about emotional health and good coping mechanisms. It seems like they were dismissive regarding all that. Which can definitely set the snowball effect of needing to constantly be validated in motion. And lead to some issues regarding long term mental health management. 

I’d mentally hold your parents accountable for contributing to that. Recognize the places it came from, parents, friendships, etc. but also recognize all the damage it can do to your current relationships if you don’t work on it. I think therapy could really help. Sometimes just having someone to rant to can be really healing. And if youre worried about exhausting momo, it might take some of the pressure off of her. 

And when it comes to the need to be the most sad/pitiful person, I understand it can feel incredibly validating, secure, safe, etc to be seen like that but like you said if you try for that for too long, it can push people away. Maybe try to work on accepting that there will always be people that have it better AND worse. 

Accept that your emotions are real and very valid without looking at other’s emotions. They’re completely separate and don’t need to be compared. Your experiences aren’t magically invalidated if you’re next to a homeless person. People have an absolute rainbow of a spectrum regarding struggles and emotions. All which are valid.

Mental health is the same way.

The odd imposter syndrome about not being unwell enough / feeling like the emotions are disproportionate to events (that it wasn't 'bad enough' to feel like this) is *extremely common* for mental illness. Sometimes that's because there was neglect, or trauma that wasn't physical. Sometimes it takes years to recognise that.

When I first needed help, I would've said I'd never really had to deal with conflict / was pretty privileged. The reality was I grew up in a lot of dysfunction and constant ignored conflict that never got resolved, I just thought it was my fault, because that's what I'd been told. It was 'normal' to me, even if it wasn't normal. Seeing a therapist and getting an external view can be helpful, if it seems like your reactions aren't proportionate to your perceptions, yeah?",shellontheseashore,18v4st0
57,"In that case, your first step would be to talk to a psychiatrist. They will listen to what you are experiencing and suggest a treatment plan. 

Something else you may want to consider is what you would recommend if a friend came to you with a situation like yours. Sometimes we have more empathy for others than we do for ourselves. If you’re not treating yourself as well as you would a friend or even a stranger, then you may need to consider applying your advice to yourself.",AnotherEpicFail,18v4st0
58,"You accomplished things because you took action, the money on your bank account have helped but you needed to choose to use it, money sitting unused in a bank account is not helpfull to you nor anybody/the economy. It is important to recognise where you had more chance than others but it doesn't mean you have to skip opportunities because someone else doesn't have the same or feel guilty for doing so. If you feel like you don't do enough, take a look at your life and right down how much you can give (and not just money but time and effort too). But I'm sure you already do plenty, just from the fact that you think you don't because it show that you care.
You need to work on your guilt, because you aren't responsible for your privilege (assuming you got it from family/circumstances out of your control) but only of how you use it.
The only way I know to help if to take action.

64,"That belief is pretty good evidence that it's 'bad enough' though, and that's being validated by people throughout the thread who have also dealt with it. And they're not just saying that to be nice. It's from experience.

If it's genetic/chemical in nature rather than from external factors, it doesn't make it not real. Appendicitis is still desperately in need of treatment, even if it isn't as externally obvious as a broken leg.

Human brains minimise events to cope with them. If it's 'no big deal' then we can bully ourselves into keeping going, until that stops working too. It's easier to believe we're in control but weak or misreading things, than it is to accept that something is outside of our control. It's easier to believe we're somehow special compared to other people, and can (or even morally *should*) endure things we'd tell friends or loved ones to seek help for.

You don't speak very kindly about yourself feeling scared or in pain. Are you often told that your feelings/perception of things is wrong?",shellontheseashore,18v4st0
65,"Ive always been told.im sensitive and I need thicker skin, so I'm fairly certain being too sensitive is all that's wrong and I don't want a there to confirm that my pain isn't real and I'm making it up",Ash-Gray-Feather,18v4st0
66,"...or what's wrong is you've been repeatedly dismissed and belittled, to the point you don't trust your own responses. Kids need the adults around them to mirror their emotions, model good coping mechanisms and hold boundaries for them to practice, or they grow up feeling the way you've described. And for both genetic/chemical based or external based disorders (and ones that are mixed, such as bpd), that's not a useful way to address them. It doesn't fix the problem or give you tools to self-soothe, it just tells you to be quiet and not bother people. The pain is an engine warning light, ignoring it doesn't make the cause go away.

Simply, if you were faking your pain, you'd know you're faking it. People can misattribute the source, or not recognise complicating factors, but you can't trick yourself into feeling something you don't feel. A good therapist knows that, and will work with you to figure out what's at the root. They shouldn't have a license if all they do is look at your family's income and decide you can't have any issues.

Even if, *absolute devil's advocate*, all that's wrong is 'too sensitive'... they can teach you skills for self-regulation, better boundaries, how to recognise you're getting overwhelmed before it hits too badly. Maybe discuss and try medication if there's factors such as anxiety or ocd in the mix. Improving functionality/quality of life is also a fine goal for therapy, it doesn't have to be about having some terrible tragedy to deal with. You should go see the doctor for checkups rather than only when in crisis, right?",shellontheseashore,18v4st0
67,"Comparing it to a doctor, if you were in pain and nobody ever believed you, wouldn't you be afraid of going to the doctor who could confirm it's not real",Ash-Gray-Feather,18v4st0
68,"Yeah, I would be (also lmao I potentially have PCOS that I'm trying to get addresses, so that one's more accurate than I'd like, ha). Just like with doctors, there are better and worse therapists. It's hard learning to self-advocate, but the alternative is continuing to live in dysfunction and pain, so I gotta. Even if that means trying a second opinion if the first is dismissive and shit.

But, it's also worth recognising different degrees of knowledge/expertise - laymen/regular people aren't going to be particularly knowledgeable about disorders that cause pain (and some will have some very out there opinions not at all supported by scientific evidence), people in communities for disorders that cause pain will probably have some good guesses to start off investigations from the information given but can't diagnose you, and a good doctor will listen to that information and possible leads and investigate it with you. They won't confirm something isn't real - that involves proving a negative - but they may reach a point of ""we have exhausted all my theories for why the pain is here, we need to refer you to see someone else or accept a bucket 'has unexplained pain' diagnosis"". That isn't the same thing as faking it.

You're allowed to be afraid. I'm sorry you've dealt with so much invalidation that even that is unacceptable. But nothing changes if nothing changes, yeah?",shellontheseashore,18v4st0
69,"I suppose so, I'm just really afraid that I'm gonna have nothing wrong with me and I want something to be wrong so I can prove it I guess, like here's the paper that says my pain is real, but I'm probably not gonna get that since I'm fine apparently",Ash-Gray-Feather,18v4st0
70,"A diagnosis is to help you, and can provide validation for you that yes, this is real and you're not broken you're just ill. It can help some people understand things they didn't before, or open doors to accommodations that can help you function... but it doesn't force people to believe you. Some people will never accept there's actually a problem and it's not just a moral failing on your part or whatever, because they *need* it to be that way. Some people can't or won't give validation and support no matter what, and at that point it becomes about making healthy choices for yourself.

Like. Idk, personal example lol. In hindsight it's pretty funny, but my mother's default reaction to any new information about me that didn't fit the concept in her head was ""no you're not"". Bisexual? ""no you're not"". Dealing with abuse from someone close to me? ""no you're not"". Depressed and struggling? ""no you're not"". Sexually harassed at school? ""no you're not"". Sick? ""no you're not"". Like damn, girl really said her fanon > canon 💀. Having other people vouch for these things, or professionals attest to the PTSD and other issues, did not change her stance, because to do so would mean she'd have to change how she treated me (which was always dismissive, minimising, conditional). It was more comfortable for her, if my needs and feelings weren't as real as hers, and there was never going to be anything I could do that would change that. I wasn't hungry or cold or hit (mostly) and was smart, so there clearly couldn't be anything wrong with me. She wanted a trophy kid, and got a real one instead. So we're not close anymore, and my symptoms are *wildly* better than they were (also thanks to therapy + medication).

I think you'll get a diagnosis pretty easily, although there's a few things it could slot into (from a very small, narrow slice of info in this post). Minimum probably depression and anxiety. It should open up some avenues of support like therapy and medication that will help a lot, once you find the right combo. But getting a diagnosis doesn't automatically fix circumstances and people around you, if they're a contributing factor.",shellontheseashore,18v4st0

72,"Yeah it's a bit funky when people decide you 100% definitely have a thing off of an online exchange 💀 but when the starting point is heavy imposter syndrome/self-doubt about not being sick enough to count, pointing out the ways it resembles various diagnoses can be an attempt to reassure/validation your suffering. I hope nobody's been a shit about it. Because from what you've shared, there is something wrong, there is dysfunction, and it is impacting your interactions with others and quality of life enough to seek treatment. The question is what is there, not if something's there.

Psychology is fun because a lot of different disorders can have similar symptoms / different traits expressed similarly, so starting at a point of ""well there's something fucky here, these self-beliefs/behaviours are Not In Baseline Ranges"" could lead in several different directions. Like, strangers on the internet, zero ability to diagnose you. But, can make some guesses at where you could start looking, and provide general feedback of ""yeah, that's not typical / it's supposed to be doing that, should get that checked out"", y'know?

I can point you at a couple subreddits I suspect might be useful, if you want? See if shit's relatable. Folks don't always recognise themselves in DSM descriptions vs people talking about living with the diagnosis.",shellontheseashore,18v4st0

They had put out missing posters and got tips about random homeless lady who looked similar to the nurse. They were able to find her and picked her up and brought her to the hospital, she was out in medication and went right back to normal. Literally went from what people would assume was a crack head on the street back to a normal hard working medical professional. 

The scary thing is the nurse has no idea what transpired in the year she was missing she had little to no memory of the year she was in psychosis.

Adhd fucks with my executive functioning. Bipolar disorder also fucks with my executive functioning, moods and has the added bonus of trying to kill me. Anxiety and ptsd mean certain sounds and stimuli ether trigger flashbacks, cause me to physically react out of instinctual fear because of what used to happen.


All 3 of those things fck and have fucked with every aspect of life. 33 years adhd, 33 years of Anxiety, Bipolar disorder 20 years and ptsd I've had in various strengths with various triggers since I was a kid.




 Functional neurological disorder is basically: trauma fucks with your brain. It does a lot of shit. Permanent and transitory. Your brain gets pissed and takes it out on your body causing physical symptoms that may or may not get better, come and go, stick around, get worse or literally put you in a wheelchair.  Speech, movement, seizures, muscle/nerve/joint pain, migraines, stimuli hypersensitivity, mis crossed nerve signals, nerves not working, breathing issues, and other fun things. What I listed isn't a complete list for me or for other people who deal with it.


And stress makes everything above worse.


Just to fucking live I have to take a handful of pills twice a day peppered with inhalers and a couple smaller handful of pills. Just to be able to work and walk and take care of my cat.


I have to structure my life and my routines around it all and with it in mind. They greatly limit what I can do, what I want to do and what I should do.


 I have to watch my moods, executive functioning and physical symptoms like a hawk. All day every day. Because if I don't my dishes pile up, meds don't get taken on time (God even forgetting my inhaler 2 days in a row fuxks with me), I don't notice Bipolar episodes or calm myself enough. If I'm not paying attention to myself physically then I'm not paying attention to how weak my legs are and I might suddenly drop to the ground when they give out. Or I don't ward off the searing muscle spasms in time and I will regret it for days. 


I can count on one hand the amount of times I've slept through the night over the past several years because of muscle spasms and nerve pain. I cant even use pillows even, I have to use a throw blanket so I have less head and neck tilt when I'm sleeping. It's actually pretty comfortable though, custom support everynight.




I can't drink, I can't sleep anywhere aside from my carefully crafted sleeping surface at home. I have limited bandwidth both physically and mentally and I have a hard time having more than a couple of friends because I just don't have enough for more.


I have 4 doctors. In the past I had 5 and a physical therapist too. I cant drive and I was never able to get a degree due to prior mentioned adhd and bipolar disorder. I technically didn't even graduate hs.


I'm currently single and I have managed multiple long term relationships in the past.  But it's going to be really hard to do that in the future with the addition of fnd.


My world is a lot and it would take a dissertation to explain it fully. But in plain words, it's something that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy, not even Hitler or put in. 


I actually got sterilized a few years back because of how fuxked my brain is. For many reasons it's dangerous for me and a child if I got pregnant and had a kid. Plus adhd and bipolar disorder is genetic. And kids learn behaviors from adults which would amount to generational trauma in this case. 


I legitimately wonder at times how many litters of cute baby animals I killed in a previous life to deserve this life.


My life isn't all that bad and I'm used to things by now but it's a shadow of what it could be. Honestly it's the fnd that just makes everything worse for  multiple reasons. I can live a good life with the other stuff. I even got married once, and then years layer almost got married again and had a kid. I have had pets all my life (my cat is currently asleep next to me and she's a happy kitty). I've learned and loved.

64,"I actually was prescribed Gabapentin and Lyrica while I was misdiagnosed with Fibromyalgia (spoiler alert: it was Lyme’s Disease). I didn’t experience any mood benefits at the time from either, but… 

Based on my research, the Gabapentin at least is used off-label for bipolar symptoms as an adjunctive treatment, so it’s possible that taking it in isolation didn’t produce the benefit for me. Do you remember what other meds you were on when you were experiencing some relief from the Gabapentin?",HermioneJane611,1bjm5f1
65,"For me I definitely experienced relief from the IV ketamine infusions… at first. To be clear, it didn’t produce comparable results to Trintellix for me (I still had automatic thoughts, for example), but it alleviated some of the severity. To use a metaphor, it was like I was drowning in the ocean, and the ketamine gave me a life jacket so I didn’t have to struggle so hard just to stay afloat. (The Trintellix airlifted me out of the ocean and put me on dry land.) For inexplicable reasons I stopped responding to ketamine after 3 years, but per my doctor 75% of patients respond to IV ketamine and it is not possible to “build a tolerance”. The thing to note is that I believe only esketamine (the intra-nasal administration) is currently approved for depression in the USA; IV ketamine is still not covered by insurance, and as of last year each infusion cost me $500. Unfortunately the Spravato team guessed wrong and pursued the less effective variant, so if you want results the IV version is superior (but J&J sank millions into getting FDA approval for esketamine, so it’s not like they’re going to pull it just because it’s less effective). 

I’m not sure what could help you specifically, and I’m not a doctor or licensed mental health professional or anything. My understanding though is that depression and bipolar are treated a little differently so it’s useful to clarify which you have; BPD cannot be diagnosed prior to addressing depression/bipolar per the DSM (and BPD is not treated with meds at all, but with Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and Mentalization Therapy); anxiety often responds well to medication management; PTSD requires trauma intervention. 

For that last, the type of treatment depends on the type of trauma; for example, I experienced something traumatic and was suffering from C-PTSD and my threat response was activated. Only I couldn’t deactivate it; I couldn’t eat (dropped 18lbs during that month), my heart rate was elevated above resting while I was asleep, etc. The treatment that helped me “reset” my sympathetic nervous system and escape my threat response was called Stellate Ganglion Block Injections (SGB) AKA Dual Sympathetic Blocks (DSB) if you do it bilaterally. It’s basically temporarily anesthetizing some nerve clusters in the sympathetic nervous system to force a “hard reboot” when all “soft restart” efforts have failed. It’s covered by insurance for some conditions under some plans, but out-of-pocket for me was $1,000 per injection.  

Now that I wasn’t in fight-flight-freeze, and could “access safety”, I could try to address the trauma in therapy, so I’m trying EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) therapy now. I lined it up to overlap with my deep TMS treatment to try to maximize results, since Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation is intended to help reduce deeply entrenched thought pathways so that you can effectively change your mind. During deep TMS I was advised that was the time to attempt new routines, to switch tracks. (JFC, I hope it helps...)

54,"As I'm finding out at age 41: **undiagnosed and untreated ADHD.** Mine flew under the radar (especially as I have so many inattentive traits, and my hyperactivity manifests in my thinking and speech patterns), and my homework and self-care, amongst other things, suffered. Yet my lack of motivation and other symptoms were blamed on clinical depression and generalized anxiety, and later fibromyalgia (diagnosed in my mid-20s, and as it turns out ADHD is far more prevalent in those with FMS than those without), and the mental health issues that started in adolescence were in turn blamed on other contributing factors such as moving to a new town just before starting middle school, teen angst, being bored, etc. Anxiety and depression are common in those with ADHD, especially those who are AFAB, and there are overlapping symptoms with ADHD.

The thing is, it's distressing and depressing to go from being the gifted kid in elementary school to feeling overwhelmed by the middle school homework load. Not being able to focus on anything unless it's stimulating enough sucks (either it's interesting or it's urgent, leading to a lot of waiting until the last minute and then pulling an all-nighter), not being able to figure out how to do better also sucks. I didn't know it at the time, but I didn't have the dopamine for my neurons to communicate and actually focus on and carry out mundane tasks that I didn't enjoy.

Undiagnosed ADHD leads to poorer outcomes in life, an increased risk of addiction, increased risk of winding up in the correctional system [(with an ADHD prevalence of 26.1% in the system)](https://caddac.ca/wp-content/uploads/ADHD-and-the-Justice-system_-the-benefits-of-recognizing-and-treating-ADHD-EN.pdf), troubled employment history, etc. I burned myself out at an admin job I left at age 28, went on disability, and haven't worked a full-time job since. I wanted to get married and have kids, and that didn't happen. I've missed out on having a career, and it has negatively impacted my social life and relationships. My troubled educational and employment history made me feel like such a screw-up. I internalized the unrecognized ADHD symptoms that impaired my executive functioning as just my being lazy and not disciplined enough. Had I been assessed and diagnosed in adolescence, I could've gotten the medication I needed and my outcome could've been much better. I'm mourning my lost potential, now.

ADHD is underdiagnosed, particularly in girls and women. As it's coming to light in more recent years, it isn't solely a childhood problem but a neurodevelopmental condition some of us are born with that many don't grow out of by adulthood. There is a whole ""lost generation"" of middle-aged and older women who were in school when ADHD was a controversial diagnosis and the stereotypical presentation was Bart Simpson: white, male, and overtly hyperactive and disruptive, and who are struggling with executive dysfunction without realizing that it could be ADHD.

Every case is different, but if your kid is struggling with school, socializing, employment, home life (such as remembering to do chores), hygiene, etc, and especially if they also suffer from depression and/or anxiety, I'd look into ADHD and having them assessed.",CCDestroyer,1be39rb

I’m not sure that parents realize their offspring are sponges.

childhood molds the adult you become and the issues that you carry into the relationships you form…thru out your whole life.

If you have any self-awareness, as you age, you can look back and understand and hopefully get a grip and not be too hard on yourself because of the issues that you have to overcome- if you are lucky.

62,"Comparing oneself (who sees all the flaws and normal issues shared by most people) to others who generally only share the very best manicured moments of their lives is a big issue. It leads a person to incorrectly believe most others are living a perfect, easy life while they feel and experience life with all of its flaws and failures. The dissonance between what they think life should be like compared to what life is actually like leaves them feeling they are an oddity among a group of others that seem perfect and always happy but others are actually not. We all struggle. We all have successes. 

That feeling of being different leads them to also hide their true beautiful selves and not share reality. This in turn has a similar impact on others around them. True conversation and real connection includes the good, the average, and the awful with others should lead to a deeper understanding that they are not alone. They are a little different but so is everyone else. Sharing your crappy and happy moments leads to real connections that will allow their peers and themselves to be more fulfilled with their imperfect selves.  Everyone at some point has their own cross to bear. We all struggle and screw up and have really bad moments in life. We also have beautiful, inexplicably wonderful moments we can share as well. Knowing that abnormal is normal and that your friends and peers are the same would eliminate a lot of dissatisfaction. 

Being real can lead to support and change to improve our lives. You need to carefully choose who you share with and reveal slowly and somewhat equally to lead to a healthy supportive relationship where your friends, like you, have moments of good, bad, and ugly. Sharing is scary and makes you vulnerable. It doesn’t always pay off. Be empathetic towards others and find friends who have empathy for you.  Choose good people. 

Also keep in mind politics is theater. Listening a little is helpful so perhaps you can help change things. Listening a lot will drive you crazy. The news hypes everything bad to get ratings. This leads us to feel everything everywhere is horrible. Some things are horrible. Compare your life experience to the news and to the BS politicians say to your real life. 99% of the horrible things you see on the news doesn’t and won’t not happen in your life. That said, life is inherently uncertain and has risks. That can’t be controlled or avoided completely. Yes, be safe and make good choices but fear cannot drive your life. Watch the political theater and news once a week. You will find it the same next week. Know your part of the world and be safe. Otherwise turn that crap off. Watching it is you giving them money and encouraging them to do it more.

The sad part is that it isn't handled correctly, any of these.

6,"Hi! I’m Susan, and I’m a licensed therapist in the States. A few questions, if you don’t mind sharing? 1.) Are your symptoms something you’ve experienced the majority of your life (regardless of severity), or did they present in your teen years? 2.) What initially led to you seeking therapy?  3.) What diagnostic assessments have you had, if any? 

While every therapist (and client) is different, I’m a firm believer in finding an ACCURATE diagnosis, in order for my clients to receive the best treatment for THEM.  Considering your poor therapeutic outcomes to this point (i.e. medications aren’t improving symptoms, CBT isn’t effective, and therapists aren’t able to help), it’s relatively safe to assume you’ve not received an accurate diagnose (nor subsequent treatment). 

I STRONGLY encourage you to disclose all of your symptoms and experiences to your psychiatrist! As mental health practitioners, specifically, we don’t have definitive blood tests to diagnose. We rely primarily on the client’s experiences. Without an accurate understanding of those experiences, we’re unable to reach an accurate diagnosis. As for me personally, I LOVE when a client suggests a possible diagnosis! (It’s funny, though, that every single client who does this is hesitant because they don’t want to be seen as “self-diagnosing”.) NO ONE knows your mental health better than YOU! You want to explore a particular diagnosis? Hell, yes! Let’s do it! You just made my job a million times easier by suggesting a path! 

As a final chapter to my novel of a response…there’s no such thing as “not being mentally ill enough” to receive quality care, and I’m so sorry you’ve been led to believe this about your experiences. Your experiences are VALID. And you absolutely deserve to feel validated by every single medical and mental health professional you work with. Please, don’t give up! It can be an exhausting journey, and sometimes we get tired of fighting. But your health, happiness, and well-being are WORTH it. YOU are worth it! 

(PS - I suggest an ADHD assessment, if you’ve not one.)

7,"Do you know what exactly it is you want from them? I'm afraid that if you are being seen by NHS and not privately then the care is only meant to keep people from dire circumstances rather than being a luxury to have a therapist at your disposal whenever you want. For that you need to go private. You should have been offered cognitive behavioural therapy (or some limited course of therapeutic sessions and/or medication). I have Schizoaffective disorder and I even go through long periods where they leave me to my own devices as long as I'm not in crisis. They (NHS) mainly prescribe me meds and I get on with my life. Their job is not to hold my hand every day, the resources need to be  allocated for the most critical needs which is only fair. That's not to say you won't ever be offered more care or that they don't care, it's just that they have to identify a specific critical need/service and if they can't identify one imminent serious risk specifically or you haven't benefited from whatever previous service you've been offered then they are not wrong about not being able to help you. 

This is just the way the system works, it's not personal. I'm sure they do take you seriously and believe you but by your own admission there's nothing you're doing that warrants giving you a more involved type of care than what you are currently receiving. Their job is not to walk you through life and all that entails. It's simply to keep you alive and fulfil your basic needs. Don't feel like an imposter, it's not you, it's them.",,12gy1yf

10,"Edit 1. Reposting text I accidentally deleted.

The responses you are getting sound unprofessional and unhelpful. Did you choose your current therapist or did your parents/guardian/agency choose for you? Either way, I would start looking for a new therapist.

No therapist should ever respond to a client with disbelief, minimizing their concerns or behaving in ways that signal that you are just being troublesome. That is the very opposite of being helpful. Your not making up problems. Even if you were engaging in behaviors that make uncomfortable as a performance for yourself—that is a reason to seek therapy! But it doesn’t sound to me like you’re performing at all. You are struggling with behaviors that aren’t good for you and that are troubling to you. A therapist should be an ally with you, not someone who responds dismissively.

I was assigned therapists by my parents or group homes from age 14 to 18. Some of them were not helpful in a more or less harmless kind of way. A couple of them were very harmful (no physical or sexual misconduct—just unprofessional crappy behavior). I had much better luck with the therapists I chose myself after I turned 18.

I have switched therapists in 2 ways. 

1. I continued to see my current therapist while I looked for a new therapist. Psychology Today has a bunch of therapist listings that can be filtered by gender, racial-linguistic-cultural background, specialty areas and the type of insurance they take. I started with those listings, left messages requesting a 10 minute phone introduction/ consultation the ones that seemed like a potential match. I prepared a list of questions to ask them that related to my top 3-5 concerns and based on what I needed in a therapist. If they didn’t call back, I crossed them off. Once we connected, I went through the questions with them. When I found someone that felt like a fit, I scheduled an initial meeting with them. If the fit still felt good, I scheduled more sessions with the new therapist and I advised my old therapist that I would be moving on.

2. I’ve also worked with a current therapist who asked around their professional network. They took my needs into consideration and provided me with a referral.

1) no, these are definitely something that happened later on. i dont have a solid timeline of events as my memory is terrible these days. i think it started getring bad around 14-15, its just been a continious downward spiral since then


2) tbh, its not rlly smth i ever sought out originally. i was under CAMHS for many years, which was kind of pushed on me because of how i acted in my teens. later on in life CAMHS refered me back to the GP as i was reaching adulthood and they were at a standstill with me in terms of areas they could help me in. i dont remember when exactly but i think i might have noticed problems a few years ago and have been on and off with GPs and the mental health services they forward me to present day. apparently im under smth called an ICM(?), idk what exactly that means as i never really had it explained to me


3) while under CAMHS i had  a couple of assessments done, ones for health anxiety (which i have since recovered from and no longer have issues surrounding this), and later diagnosis for ADHD and ASD when i was around 16-17 (i forget the exact year, im sorry)


im glad you seem to open to the suggestion of diagnosis from a client, im just not so sure i really have a good enough understanding of these conditions and the last thing id want is to end up looking like an idiot by suggesting something and seeming like im begging for attention by faking an illness or some kind. im really scared of not being taken seriously as it is, the fear of the psychiatrist turning around and calling me out of attention seeking is enough to make me never wanna disclose any of my struggles (i think thats half the reason i feel the need to squash down how badly these things effect me, but again, maybe im just being dramatic and they really arent a big deal.. idk. my head is so foggy lol)

please dont apologise for the long reply by the way, i dont mind at all! im just glad someones takem a genuine interest in my problems for once, i dont often feel like im being listened to so its a breathe of fresh air

30,"Thank you so much for replying! It’s absolutely okay that the details are a little fuzzy. A general idea helps tremendously! 

This may be a difficult/sensitive topic, and certainly not one you have to reply to over a public forum. Just wanted to share some information that may be helpful in your search for answers. 

IF I were you therapist, my next line of questioning would involve history of traumatic events/experiences.  Reasoning: 1.) Health anxiety typically presents in people who’ve had a relatively severe negative healthcare experience. 2.) Dissociation is a common coping mechanism for individuals who’ve endured trauma. 3.) You seem to have a prominent fear that others (especially medical professionals) will minimize, or dismiss your concerns, leading me to feel you’ve been dismissed or made to feel less than before. 

General information that may or may not be helpful:
- Borderline Personality Disorder is DEVELOPED rather than onset at birth like ADHD, ASD, etc. 
- Typically symptoms start to present in early teen years, though we’re not recommended to diagnose BPD until adulthood. 
- Borderline Personality Disorder develops after acute or chronic trauma alters the functioning/development/structure of the brain. (Essentially, if you have BPD, you have trauma.) 
- TYPICALLY, (though not always), BPD is developed after trauma involving the neglect/abandonment/abuse from a parent or parental figure. (This is why BPD is generally marked by an intense fear of abandonment.) 
- The correlation between ADHD and BPD is remarkable! I can’t remember the exact statistic, but I can safely say, if a client has ADHD, and Trauma, I automatically assess for BPD on principle. 
- Unfortunately, there’s not a medication directly formulated to treat BPD, though there is certainly a medication regimen that helps! 
- I’m not sure if it’s assessable where you’re located, but we have a genetic testing program called Genesite that is freaking phenomenal. It’s a mouth swab that generates a report suggesting which mental health medications work best with your genetic markers. It cuts out ALOT of the annoying trial and error guessing game that comes with traditional methods of medication management. I’d suggest getting it done, if it’s an option! 

Hope this is helpful! If you have any questions, or concerns, please let me know! I’m more than happy to help in any way I can!",Awkward_Necessary_41,12gy1yf

44,"Yeah. With diagnosis of mental health it’s hard to do with 1 session with a psychiatrist, it’s really a long term thing.
For example I was diagnosed as a teen with generalised anxiety disorder, which really is just a blanket term people give to say you just have lots of anxiety. It’s not a diagnosis. 

I then in the past year see my psychiatrist and I’ve got a mixture of diagnosis, anxiety, depression, ptsd, panic disorder and bipolar traits.

So from what I can tell, autism and adhd can sometimes be diagnosed but you may have some BPD traits or CPTSD, it seems common with those. 

Obviously I’m not a doctor but just from researching and talking to my psychiatrist(I had an ex with BPD and she was similar, reckless, self destructive, impulsive, and always had suicide and self harm on her mind.)

And what you shared reminded me of some of my journey.

People were assigning me therapists and not once did I get heard by them in the way I needed to. And none of them could identify the most important thing that was going on with me. The worst one refused to call me by my correct name and said some things that were highly inappropriate and that dissuaded me from opening that particular door again for years.

No one else was as bad as that guy, but none of the other ones were very helpful.

When I was able to choose my own therapist, I started with one I had seen before (chosen for me). I stopped seeing her within a couple of months. I eventually found someone who had the correct background, training and insight to help me. She was a professor at the community college I attended as will as a credentialed therapist. I had taken a psychology class with before asking her to see me as my therapist her and because of that, I knew she would be a good fit. I was right. She was wonderful, and I finally was able to experience what a genuine connection was in therapy and to get the help I needed. 

The therapists you have seen, I’m guessing, were well intentioned people who were not understanding you adequately. Then that happens repeatedly, it’s crazy making and makes one doubt everything about themselves.

Medications like Buspirone (class of drugs called anxiolytics) are used for anxiety disorders but also BPD. Also, in moderation, Benzodiazepines (eg Lorazepam and diazepam) help for short term reduction of emotional regulation problems and could stop you self-harming or drinking to cope with the overwhelming emotion.

- i drink, but not regularly (its just never for the right reasons, its always with the intent to BE drunk)

- self harm every once in a while but again, this isnt super often (no where near the level it used to be anyway)

- emotional dysregulation, hard to say. whats considered to be normal? 

- dissociation is the only symptom im semi confident about. im always zoning out, things around me often feel floaty and i have a hard time remembering things, thinking straight, etc. its like being on drugs but it can last days (but again, there still doubt because sometimes it happens and im fine, sometimes even mildly euphoric about being in that state so maybe its not as bad as i think it is, or it is bad and i dont know it)

my concept of whats normal and what isnt is pretty scewed but i feel like id have to be an actual danger to myself on the regular to qualify for that kind of diagnosis so maybe im okay? idk

in regards to Fluoxetine, i can confidently say it never worked for me. at best i felt little to no change, at worse it made me dissociate more and have frequent vivid, gorey and disturbing nightmares as well as the occasional night terror involving personal triggers. i quit cold turkey and flat out refused to take it again, despite my GPs pressuring me into ""just trying again"". thats actually why im seeing a psychiatrist now because i refused to take Fluoxetine again, theyre reluctantly going to try me on some diff meds and see if that helps

thank you for believing me btw. its difficult when i dont have a proper grasp on how i really feel and whether or not im just acting out what i think someone whos mentally ill should be like (like some kind of stereotype). i dont even believe myself sometimes, its THAT bad (which has lead me to some rlly poor discussions around my mental health with people who really didnt ask/need to hear abt it. its an actual problem)

64,"Here is some additional information from the NHS on talk therapy, seeing a private therapist for pay and other resources 

Private counselling

If you decide to pay to see a private therapist, make sure they're qualified and you feel comfortable with them.

The cost of private counselling can vary depending on where you live, with a session costing anywhere between £10 and £70.

Many private therapists offer an initial free session and lower rates for students, job seekers and those on low wages.

You should ask about charges and agree a price before starting a course of counselling.

Charities and voluntary organisations

Some charities and voluntary organisations also offer counselling. These organisations usually specialise in a particular area, such as couples counselling, bereavement or family guidance.

You do not need a referral from a GP for an appointment for these services, but you may have to pay a fee to cover the cost of your sessions.

Charities that may offer counselling include:

Cruse Bereavement Care – for bereavement advice and support
Rape Crisis England & Wales – for women and girls who have been raped or sexually abused
Relate – for relationship advice and counselling
Samaritans – for people to talk about whatever's troubling them at any time
Victim Support – for victims and witnesses of crime
You may also be able to access support groups through your local community, church or social services.

Finding a qualified therapist

As counselling involves talking about sensitive issues and revealing personal thoughts and feelings, your counsellor should be experienced and professionally qualified.

Reputable therapists will be registered with a professional organisation that's been accredited by the Professional Standards Authority (PSA). This means they have met the PSA's required professional standards to practise.

You can find a qualified therapist in 3 simple steps on the PSA website

Other talking therapies

As well as counselling, there are many other types of psychological therapies (or talking therapies) that involve talking to a therapist about your feelings or problems.",Ginger_Pond,12gy1yf
65,"Nothing wrong with a long response. Your alcohol use is consistent with somebody using it as a maladaptive coping mechanism. It not an Alcohol-Use-Disorder but binge drinking just to get drunk and numb things for a bit is a combination of avoidance and self harm. I think a definite symptom of a mental health issue. Self- harm still happens and has done in the past and therefore may re-emerge if triggered. I haven’t got a clue what normal is or what it is supposed to look like. In terms of emotional disregulation, don’t overthink normal from what society expects, think about your emotions and how easy or hard it is to suddenly be upset or angry or anxious or scared or any emotion (feelings) that you might strongly feel without much prompting. With the dissociation, you are trying to minimise the validity of your symptom. If you were a danger to yourself, you would be in a locked mental health facility. For a diagnosis, you don’t need to get it from behind a locked door. There are so many people around the world with various mental health diagnoses that are perfectly functional and work or study. The key is getting the right diagnosis and the right treatment for that diagnosis. Maybe therapy of various types and probably meds, which if the right meds, can be a game changer. When you see the psychiatrist, don’t minimise your symptoms, say it as you feel it. Just because you may not be Acute now, doesn’t mean that you haven’t been or you won’t be again.

Somebody else might go run 20km, which on face value would be admirable, unless they are doing it as an avoidance strategy from the world. It then becomes the same as someone who binge drinks occasionally to avoid the world. 

There are actually 357 possible diagnoses in the DSM-V (the guide psychiatrists use to make a diagnosis). Anxiety and depression is generally what society thinks of when we talk mental health, as per your assumption. However, there are at least another 355 conditions which constitute a mental illness. Some people need to hit rock bottom in order to seek a diagnosis while other people don’t. The “when I get diagnosed” is not about waiting until I hit rock bottom or my condition is not valid, it’s how do I manage these symptoms. Whether the diagnosis is a Personality Disorder or Mood Disorder or whatever, it should be viewed no differently than anxiety or depression. Only you can answer if you have hit rock bottom.

Benzo misuse is a [public health concern](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6639084/). [You can become dependent on them in days](https://www.fda.gov/media/142368/download). Panic attacks **increase** after stopping (need to find a book for citation once I'm back in town).

Meanwhile, you're advocating for a world in which a senile 60-year-old with reading glasses, who got his practicing license 50 years ago and glanced at webmd while writing a scripts, dictates what you get physically addicted to and exposes you to the risks above with a flick of the wrist. Probably because he's ""seen it work in other patients."" That's how knee-jerk fixes like [bzd's are overused](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/benzodiazepine-epidemic) and have been [so since the 80's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2218485/).

&#x200B;

How we treat mental health is not right, and I don't think more bzd's are the answer. In fact, I think the answer is a system with less medication, more active subsidized therapy solutions that involve exercise, sunlight and other therapeutic methods. Here are a list of organizations with innovative, forward facing perspectives: https://www.madinamerica.com/initiatives/",jamescgames,12gy1yf
101,"Not upset, just frustrated at the system. Their comment broke down how you should ""game"" the medical system to get the ""right"" treatment.

102,"I don’t disagree with any of that. If we could have a perfect mental health treatment regime without the need for any class of medication, we would be in a perfect world that I would support.

The reality is that different psychopharmacology can assist people become more functional and in some cases level the playing field. Most pharmacology have published side effects which may or may not effect an individual, depending on their physiology. At no point have I said “take a various type of medication”. What I have said is that several classes of medication (not just BZD) have been scientifically shown through statistically valid scientific methods to reduce symptoms. This does not mean that a prescribing doctor will deem it appropriate and, if he does, the duty of care is on the doctor to adjust dosage or medication class  accordingly to address side effects or abuse. BZD are not the only medication open to abuse (which the majority of prescribing practitioners are well aware of and, if reputable, will monitor). You have extracted a very small subset of the medical community and made a sweeping generalisation about their competence and their ability to make a Pharmaceutical decision on anything other than anecdotal evidence.  

There will always be people who rort the system with benzodiazepines, opioids, stimulants. That is not going to change. “Throwing the baby out with the bath water” is not how you solve that problem. People still medically benefit from classes of medication that are open to abuse or have a street value and rather than denying a legitimate patient, the prescribing medical practitioner has the duty of care around responsible prescribing.",HuckyBuddy,12gy1yf
103,"I also meant to say, madinamerica looks like a very interesting group of initiatives. Also when I read the FDA Safety Communication, I came to a realisation that we are more closely aligned in our thinking, we just have some minor differences or misunderstanding in our communication. 

I agree that BZD are open to abuse, addictive, tolerance building and need tight control mechanisms. Those tight control mechanisms have been delegated to the prescribing medical practitioner. The Government have taken a tougher stance on opioids for Chronic Pain because science has realised that opioids are far too dangerous for long term use. The problem is that a doctor is now too scared to prescribe for acute pain (a broken bone for a few days to get over the hump). Stimulants like Adderall, Dexamphetamine, Ritalin etc are also readily abused but conditions like ADD (ADHD), ASD, Narcolepsy and probably a bunch of others  actually have a therapeutic need. Again, it is up to the prescribing medical practitioner to determine whether the patient is legitimate and is safe to be prescribed the medication. If the medical practitioner has any doubts, they can find an alternative or limit the distribution of the prescription. The accuracy, I can’t verify, but I saw a documentary on an Adderall epidemic in the US. The focus was on abuse, black market but actually more concerning people going to doctors faking symptoms in order to get a prescription. 

For any pharmaceutical intervention for any condition, we need to have a gatekeeper, the prescribing medical practitioner. Are they perfect, nope they are human, and there is a reliance on the fact that these individuals keep up their professional development. In most cases, from my experience, they do. We started the discussion with BZD, which are a good example of scientific research. In the 1980s you could buy them over the counter and was known mainly as a housewife staple. A common occurrence was a glass of wine and a couple of Valium. 40 years later we know that the behaviour in the 1980s was dangerous and irresponsible. So, scientific evidence has shown that BZD is effective for the treatment for certain conditions which can allow the patient to be functional. The trade off are potential side effects, of which many are listed, but not everyone will get. The modality of treatment of any medical condition is really up to the treating doctor and patient to discuss, taking into account any potential side effects of that modality of treatment.",HuckyBuddy,12gy1yf
104,"lmao, i think youre reading too deep into this.

besides, ive already said im not going to take anything a medical professional hasnt written of on (that includes me somehow trying ""game"" the system as you put it). its not on me to suggest which medications they decide to put me on, thats entirely down to them and their assessment of what might/might not work",sade8792,12gy1yf
105,"Linking psychopharmaceutical with the words ""medically benefit"" and ""level the playing field"" are from the playbook of someone who doesn't believe in short term medication. Those words are stuck in a decade where ""treating chemical imbalance"" was thought to be scientifically accurate. Not only do we now know that's not true, but we only recently have figured out what bzds do to the brain. We prescribed them for 30 years without that knowledge. What do you think we'll figure out in the next 30 years? Are we even respecting the nerve and brain damage that can occur with bzds? I'm not talking about abuse... I'm talking about 3 days of use leading to dependency. I'm talking about overprescription of bzds in the elderly (who barely know what meds their nurses give them).


I mean, look at the percentage of Americans on bzds. 5%? What problem are we treating? Are we really ""levelling the playing field"" and more importantly, are we really helping folks?


No, I'm not throwing the baby out with the bath water. I'm talking about moving towards less knee jerk prescriptions when someone mentions anxiety or depression in a clinical setting. I'm talking about pushing for solutions that actually help people in the long run.


ERs and clinicians across the states default to typical antipsychotics and psychopharmaceuticals like bzds, building reliance and dependencies with every. Single. Case. Of. Anxiety. And. Depression.


If you're really talking about short term prescriptions, you're talking about a tiny subset of the populations who get prescribed a small dose of bzds for emergencies. Plane rides that trigger psychotic episodes and similar situations.


You're more likely to get prescribed bzds if you're already prescribed opioids. It takes a few days to become dependant on bzds. You get more panic attacks after stopping bzds. All study-backed facts.


Given this context I fail to see how I'm any world your case, the case that people aren't being helped by the ""miracle that are psychopharmaceuticals is much less compelling than my case: psychopharmaceuticals are dangerous, overperscribed and should be treated with extreme caution as a last resort.


And given this info let's go back to case one, i.e.; the guy who was extremely depressed. He goes to his doc, gets 30 benzo pills and goes home. Gets anxious, panicky and depressed. Takes one. Feels better, falls asleep.


The same thing happens the next day. You think he's not going to take that pill? Really? Do you think he's ever going to learn sustainable methods for learning to cope with his anxiety and depression? Do you think, as an anxious, depressed and possibly addictive person, that he'll resist taking those pills when he gets an anxiety attack every week? Every day? And then he tries to stop taking them and life gets worse. And he now has a new problem in life... Withdrawal and side effects. What then?


Idk man... That's a grim world to live in.


---edit to add: you're argument seems to be that bzds are a magic bullet that solve anxiety. YES. They obviously are. Every study will tell you that. They are the best short term fix for anxiety there is. More nuanced studies and broader perspectives will show you that they're a magic bullet that scrapes your brain. And when that happens to more than just individuals, but groups of folks struggling with anxiety, they become a magic ray gun that changes the lives of many for the worse. You would be hardpressed to find an op-ed titled ""bzds saved my life."" You'll find many titled ""bzds fucked my life""",jamescgames,12gy1yf

107,"Sure! Good luck, have a nice day!",jamescgames,12gy1yf
108,"I am not saying BZDs are a magic bullet at all. The nature of the conversation just focused on BZDs because you narrowed the overall scope. I already acknowledged the risks associated with them before you posted your first one liner post plus just indicated that they are a class of medication prescribed for anxiety and that efficacy has been shown through research. Because I did mention multiple classes of medication and it is up to the doctor whether they prescribe or not, the detail of every side effect is not my purview but that of the doctor and pharmacist. The conversation about pharmacology started because OP indicated that a First Line SSRI had not helped for the last 2 years, which based on the simple description of symptoms didn’t surprise me. My pharmacology discussion was to indicate that a first line SSRI is not the only option, if pharmacology is part of the modality of treatment.

I am not sure why Opioids and BZD would be prescribed together as an Opioid is an analgesic for severe pain. An opioid/BZD mix would be really messy. I am not sure why BZD would be prescribed for a Depressive Disorder. An atypical antipsychotic in low doses I have seen prescribed as an adjunct to an SNRI or SSRI instead of BZD. Low dose of the antipsychotic is the key as an adjunct. There are anticonvulsants that have off label efficacy for Anxiety. Also, blood pressure medication has off label efficacy. Prasosin helps with nightmares, deleting the need for BZD before bed. Clonodine has anxiety reduction efficacy and is sometimes prescribed instead BZD.

The other issue (which I have yet to do any detailed research, so I could be mistaken) is around chemical imbalance. Now traditionally we have said the causal factor of a Depressive Disorder is either environmental or insufficient Serotonin. I don’t think environmental factors can be argued. My understanding is that the recent research shows that a reduction of Serotonin is not accurate. Where I need to undertake a more detailed look is the two anecdotal hypotheses that I have heard. One is “no Serotonin problem, so no chemical issues associated with Depression”. The other hypothesis is “not low Serotonin which indicates a more complex chemical imbalance”. Once neuroscientists have figured it out, I will get off the fence.

I agree - it is a grim world.

Have a chuckle at this.

109,"One more aspect, why would you rely on a long term pharmaceutical as the modality of treatment. I am all for short pharmacological interventions, and I not sure why you think otherwise. Those cliches I used are not just long term view. The reality is some people need medication ranging from a first line SSRI to somebody with comorbities requiring poly pharmacy. There will be people who require none and of those (overprescribing) some will get something.

All these people are the same in that they need more modalities of treatment. Pharmaceuticals are just one modality of treatment and not seen as “got the magic pill, I’m all good”. Modalities of treatment can be as simple as going for a run, or a mindful walk on a trail, having a coffee and chat with a friend, meeting new people or doing a hobby, eating healthy, drinking lots of water, reduce alcohol. A bunch more things too. Another modality is with a therapist is explore yourself. Find a type of therapy that works for you whether traditional psychotherapies like CBT, ACT, DBT, IPT, Positive Psychology or an alternative approach like Somatic Psychotherapy or Buddhist retreat.

Reminds me of those popular girls in high school who if you dare try to criticize or take her place she drag you down and change everything you thought about reality and turn the whole school against you (or in his case the people who downloaded tiktok which is about 1billion people.) And really. Some can be great with her others not so much, in this case not so much is the answer. Cutting something about as toxic as how tiktok can be is a really great thing to help you become better. I'd suggest you also mention it to the person you like about it and how you're wanting to change for the better.

Tiktok's basically in a sense a drug as it's addicting for the short time you can watch videos and you basically wasted your whole day.

>I substituted TikTok for YouTube and I watch videos but idk if that's an issue or not.

As with all things, the issue is time. You are a direct effect of how you spend your time and how that carries with you. TikTok eats away time like no other, in a way that encourages instant gratification, and makes engaging with anything that takes work to get your dopamine more of a chore. 

But you can also cheat code the time thing as an advantage. Certain activities, some even as simple as taking a walk around the block, are essentially guaranteed to release some dopamine in your brain, but it also provides a sense of satisfaction from doing something good for yourself. Consciously doing even just one or two activities like that and being mindful of how they make you feel good while you do them, especially if there’s a challenge involved such as with exercising, can feel like significant positive lifestyle change while being accessible on a day to day basis",LifeSpanner,yfg5ij

60,"This is both a really good question and a really challenging question to answer.

Mental health is such a broad swath of issues, as in how they manifest, their frequency, duration of episodes (if it is episodic), treatments, etc.

I take your question to be more of a long-term commitment question. More like, ""Would you be able to maintain a long-term living relationship with a person who suffers from mental health issues once you understood the challenges the person faced, i.e. highs, lows, outbursts, etc?""

Unfortunately there are so many people suffering from mental health issues, including myself (ADHD).  There are basically four types of people when it comes to relationships when at least one of the people has a mental health issue.

1) the person who knows they cannot handle a relationship with a person with mental health issues. At least you know up front so you don't waste time and energy on that person.

2) the person who is not sure but willing to give it a try. Toss up as they may be ok with it for a while, but then realize how challenging it can be.  This type is a real challenge as you can put a lot of time and energy into the relationship only to have it fail in the end.  That can be devastating to you.

It can also lead you to try to hold onto a relationship that just won't work out.  It can be held together for a while by you trying to put up a false front that your mental health issues are not as impactful as they actually are...which can be exhausting for you.  You SO may also be holding on because they don't want to hurt you.

3) the person who accepts the other person's mental health issues but loves the person regardless of the issues - the person you are searching for.

4) the sociopath - they see your mental health issues as a shortcut to controlling you.  Stay away from anyone who makes you feel worse about yourself and that you are lucky they are willing to put up with you 



The good news is that there are people who will see the real amazing you.  They see that the good times with you far outweigh the challenging times.  They will be there to support you and to build you up.  They know you are absolutely worth it.

Find those people.  You are totally worth it.",SirsDesires,qymnx0

There are people that would and those people are just better than me and I want to shake their hand.

For me a stable close partner is a pillar of life that I wouldn’t want to mess with. The others I wouldn’t want to mess with are stable finances, a stable place to live, and stable physical health. When you have these securities, it enables you to focus the full force of your energy into whatever you want, careers, hobbies, service, etc and it becomes easier to take risks that pay off.

If I was constantly worrying about my partner, I know I wouldn’t have the mental bandwidth to do the things I do now. I know this because I used to live with my parents after college who themselves have a lot of issues, particularly my dad who is colloquially an asshole but likely the victim of a lot of trauma early in his life.

I was verbally abused, and sometimes physically abused, on a constant basis. I was a very understanding person but realized that in my understanding, I wasn't taking care of myself.

Other mental health issues that don't necessarily include treating your partner like shit are ok in my book. I would even be drawn to someone with depression because that person would seem real and relatable.

I would definitely date someone with mental health again. No doubt about it. When it comes to the more ""serious"" ones, it's really important to talk to your partner and how to support eachother. For instance, I learned about bpd to the best of my abilities and it helped SO MUCH being able to understand and see certain signs etc.

In my relationship, I am the one with the mental health issues, through all my problems, she has been there to support me and it has helped me in ways I can not describe.

Just because someone has mental health issues, does not mean they can’t find love, I think they just have to be a bit more picky or they can end up in a situation like you found yourself in, which could make mental health issues worse. You just need to find someone that is accepting of your issues and would be willing to stand by you at your low points, as well as your highs.

85,"As someone with BPD, ADHD, Schizoaffective Disorder and other comorbidities who is in a long term (7 years) relationship with someone with BPD, Autism, BiPolar and also Schizoaffective Disorder with comorbidities, yes. 

We went through our sort of manic honeymoon phase and we were both unaware of our mental illnesses so it naturally moved into a pretty toxic and triggering phase of our relationship. We did learn a lot about ourselves and each other, and there were times where I considered leaving. What ultimately made me realize I was absolutely in it for the long haul was that we both wanted to be better. I was able to be in a place to make those steps first and seek therapy and that changed a lot about regulating my own anxiety towards a lot of my partners behaviors and it also taught me compassion about what he was going through. But, in that time I needed to decide if I was willing to wait for him to make the action steps to seek a therapist and anything else he may need for support. Because everyone deserves to do things on their own time but absolutely no one should be expected to necessarily “put up” with harmful or hurtful behaviors. And I decided yes that it was worth it. And I am so happy I did because now we are both in therapy and building our support systems and working towards being mentally well. 

I think what’s important is you need to find someone who is either already mentally ill but already doing all of that work so they know how to communicate well, or someone who is open minded and compassionate to understand more about what you go through. Otherwise, if they’re not choosing to be engaged with your treatment they might as well admit they’re not looking for something long term with you.

Of course, not everyone can handle being in a relationship with someone with mental health problems and there's nothing generally wrong with that.

- whether or not you can handle taking care of someone else in a relationship (in my experience it can be challenging to make sure the other person is fulfilled between taking time to make sure you’re okay) 

- whether or not your partner is ready to care for someone with mental health issues (i think regardless of whether or not your partner has mental heath issues, they may not be able to help those around them) 

- whether or not you’d be enabled (this is specific to certain mental illnesses, essentially whether or not the relationship would make your mental health worse or better)

From your side you have to do some hard work yourself. You have to be able to have open honest communication, be able to relay things to your partner that you do understand about yourself, triggers, responses, needs that your perspective partner can do to help you through episodes. 

I have made it a part of my life to research and understand BPD, my girls triggers, moods, swings etc.  I have to understand key things as well, such as I can not fix her, that is not my place, I am not a professional in that field.

With my first girlfriend, I spent fucking hours googling things about eds, about how I can help, and what I should and shouldn’t do. It was hard at first, watching from the sidelines, knowing that I do not have enough power to genuinely help her in the ways that she’s helped me (she was also the first person I fell in love with). I asked her about it, and I learned that I actually was helping. For her, my love, my company, my ears, and my words—they truly were helping her, (but wait…that’s how she helped me so much, haha).

I also come from a broken home and a long family history of mental illness. Lots of bipolar, depression, anxiety, OCD, ADHD… you name it, we have it. Which is partly why I get defensive. I’ve seen my loved ones struggle throughout their lives with their mental health but also have full, interesting, and love-filled lives. It’s all about finding the right partner. 

Someone that says at the beginning of a relationship “I will stay in your life forever” most likely will not. It’s not a realistic promise to make someone you just started seeing (or have even been seeing for months) and people who say this early on are being manipulative or they’re just very naive. So I’m sorry you’ve seen that and taken it to heart. Its not the way things usually work. 

You do sound a bit young? Apologies if I’m wrong here. Take time to figure some stuff out if you don’t feel ready to date, but don’t *not* date because of your BPD. I know for me (depression, anxiety, adhd) made me bloom a little later, if you will. I didn’t really figure out how to have healthy relationships until I was in my late 20s. So if it takes you a while or you’re not ready or just feeling insecure about it, no need to pressure yourself right now.

I have a friend (a girl) who I have known for years. Since we were kids. She was recently diagnosed with BPD and “came out” about it on Facebook. I think the public post was appropriate in her case because her relationships with many of our friends had suffered due to some of her behaviours over the past few years.

Since then she’s been doing well in therapy, her friends have forgiven her, she’s socialising with all of us again and she’s now in her second long term relationship with a guy. The first one (with a guy as well) still lasted about 6 years, despite the fact she wasn’t officially diagnosed with BPD for that period and was struggling to understand and control her self-destructive behaviour.

Her current boyfriend knows she has BPD obviously and they seem very happy together regardless.",heinz_inthecity,qymnx0

The only advice I feel like I'm capable of giving is just 'run your own race' which I got from Bluey lol. Your life is yours, you cannot fail it.

I suffer an issue regarding Will power (which i think is very different from Motivation, Low energy). I need to be told or guided to do something. I aint a leader I follow directions. ""Just do it"" isn't something I can do lol.

If you can find out what Makes you fail. (If it's not a developmental disorder) it can be fixed. I'm not exactly sure how to find it. I wanna say take a step out of reality and analyze; or Look up what it feels like to have Low Will power, Motivation, energy, etc. And see what matches with you.. I'm sure there are more options at play, im sure there are times where it feels like nothing and you're just empty. I'm not sure how to help. I do not know how I got past it. Everything past this really is a guess on what I did and would recommend in a general sense.

- Will Power? It's like an old Engine where you need to crank the CAM Shaft for it to start running. In my experience you just need a push. (Don't study it'll make you brain dead). 

- Motivation? Look at who is marking you a fail (Teacher parents) and ask. ""What do you want from me'. Spend a little Motivation to hopefully get an answer. Then look at your current life, and compare what is different. Very important: Break down the differences. They need As when you have Cs? Not important you are already passing school. They need your room clean? IMO that's your choice but break down steps. It's not cleaning your room; it's Make the bed, Pick shit up, Sweep. Something as abstract as clean the room gets easier with Steps.

- Low energy? Reward yourself. Do one small thing, I.e. Answer a question, Clean a bit, then reward yourself with a game or cuddle a stuffed animal. Keep doing this and extend the working time slowly and keep the break/resting time consistent and you'll get more energy.

Remember, in the end. It's your life. You might be doing more or less than the average person of your demographic. Who cares, do work, make money, and find the light that makes you happy.

She would cower when people tried to pet her, try to run and then pee all over herself when you tried to get her in a car, scream bloody murder if you ever touched her paws, etc. She's now the friendliest, happiest pup. She wags her tail at every stranger, gets very excited for adventures in the car, and lets me trim her nails without complaint. Training her to overcome her fears trained me to overcome mine. It was the most healing thing I could have ever possibly imagined. And I would have never thought to do it if my therapist had not recommended it.

So there's absolutely nothing wrong with making the recommendation. People just need to be mindful of whether or not it's a good option for them. Nobody should ever follow internet advice blindly, but it's still a good recommendation.",GrotiusandPufendorf,16zvcfd
5,"Dunno about this. I agree in some ways, but when I was incredibly depressed and lonely during the pandemic and not mentally that well off, I adopted a kitty to keep me company.

I fully support getting an ESA or psychiatric service dog if they’re necessary but they’re a living creature so it’s important to not get them if you can’t take care of them, don’t expect them to be a cure, choose a breed that’s a good fit, and don’t rush into that decision. I plan on getting a dog who’ll eventually be my psychiatric service dog but I’m putting that dog first. I’m waiting until I move and have more emergency savings + the supplies and emergency plans just in case. That dog will be family and a huge responsibility, NOT a cure. I’m also firm on the breed because I know my needs, experience and future situation.

It’s my responsibility to wait until I’m able and ready to care for them and ensure if something happens to me they have a safe temporary or permanent place to go. A dog is a huge responsibility and commitment and they’re family.",247365_Music,16zvcfd
8,"100% agree. I love my dog, he's my baby, and I won't give him up, but getting him made my mental health so much worse. 

The lack of freedom and being forced to do things you don't want to do (e.g. walking the dog, having to deal with other dog owners at the park, etc.) is escpecially bad when you have ADHD, anxiety, and depression. 

Also, every dog is different. A dog that's easy to train is a bit better than a dog that's hard to train. Puppy blues is real and the first year of getting him was one of the worst years of my life. 

We are bonded now, he makes me laugh, I love teaching him new tricks, but the feeling of regret for losing our freedom (my husband and I used to do weekly spontaneous trips) is something I don't wish on anyone. 

Having a dog is not like in the movies! Mental health issues or not, only get a dog, if you can commit 10-15 years of your life to caring for another living being and if you can live with the fact that you will have a daily routine that doesn't work when you like to do things on a whim.",thekoalady,16zvcfd

It is nearly impossible for me to do things when depressed *for myself* but it is not as difficult for me to do something for someone else. That creates movement and effort where there would normally not be any. So I think it’s a fine line. Pets force people into action because it is our innate instinct to care for them. Now I recognize that this is not always the case, but I think most people would benefit with a pet  and that pet would not be neglected because of depression. The only issue being there’s not a certainty which leans towards your point. I just don’t think it goes that way more than we would think.",livewire042,16zvcfd

21,"I have lived with dogs and cats since the day I was born. I swear by how much they've supported me over the years. But I would never EVER recommend someone get a pet unless they are able to offer it all the love and care it deserves. My pets are my children. I skip out on things I enjoy to get them into the vet asap if anything's wrong. I put HOURS into training them and retraining myself if my pet requires different handling than the others in my menagerie. 

Pets are WORK, and it's like the sayings about loving your work meaning you're not working- if having a pet is for you and you love taking care of them, it's easy to see all the pros! I know I do! But I also have a realistic view of mental health (I have adhd and anxiety) and I know how hard it can be to maintain your pet's standard of care and really show them they're loved when your mental health is in the toilet. It is absolutely not fair to ANY animal to be put in a position to be the ""guinea pig"" (for lack of better words) to test out the pros and cons of pets in real time.

I always recommend people come hang out with my pets (or the pets of someone you know, or just go to a dog park). Lots of pet owners are totally ok with you loving on their animals- I love it because it reinforces my dogs' socialization! You get the love, adoration, and snuggles that way without throwing yourself headfirst into pet-parenthood. Then, try petsitting when friends go out of town. They save money on boarding, you get a trial run! Or, I've even heard tell that some shelters will let you take dogs out for day trips on hikes or to the park- part time dog ownership!

So yes, pets are wonderful, but they're still a lot of work. My oldest dog gets 4 pills in the morning, 3 in the evening, and 2 joint supplements every night. My youngest gets an allery pill daily. You have to keep up with flea/tick and heartworm prevention. They need to be vaccinated and neutered unless you intend to breed them. They need fresh water and exercise and ATTENTION. I also have 3 cats. There are 6 litterboxes in my house. The dogs want to get into the litterboxes. It's a full on war.",Imaginary-Hunter-153,16zvcfd

I could have worded what I said better, and you filled in the blanks. I do know that people who recommend only do so because of their own personal experiences—ya’ll are just trying to help. I guess what I do hope for is, when suggesting it, an acknowledgment that a pet isn’t a fix it all solution but a responsibility with its own wants and needs. There is an element of giving advice responsibly. Your therapist probably determined that you would be a good fit to take care of an animal, and you also had your therapist to help—you didn’t just depend on your dog. And yeah, you’re right, there should be some self-awareness involved with deciding if you want to get a pet. You shouldn’t flippantly get a pet if you feel you personally wouldn’t be responsible enough, and I don’t want to, with this post, demonize people who try to get a pet and then later realize they can’t handle it. I do like to believe that people are genuinely trying their best. 

Just like what I said earlier about personal situations, I unfortunately encountered situations where I have seen animals mistreated and neglected. However, I do
know not every pet owner, particularly ones who get pets to help with any health issue, are bad pet owners. Health is extremely individualistic, and what works for one might not for another.

28,"I’m really happy that your kitty helped you out during the pandemic! That’s awesome and I don’t want my post to take away from that. The reason why I still stand by what I said, however, is because you described your depression and loneliness as rather situational- it was due to the pandemic, and since you weren’t kept busy you had more time to think about thoughts you didn’t before. Your kitten helped keep you busy in a time when we had no idea what was going on. I don’t want to take away from your mental health issues of course—I don’t know you, and I really hope I didn’t sound dismissive. I’m sorry you had an incredibly hard time during the pandemic. But I unfortunately do know people who got pets in order to help with their mental health and found the responsibility too overwhelming, resulting in neglect, which was my main motivation for posting. I also know with my personal situation, it would be rather selfish of me. I can’t even take care of a fish properly, let alone a cat. Fortunately you were able to take care of your kitty and even found it inspiring. 

But I do know that mental health is EXTREMELY individualized. What works for one may not work for another, and in your situation you were able to take care of your cat and even use your cat as motivation, which is huge and awesome! I am just worried about instances in which animals are not taken care of because people use them as a bandaid. Like I said I’ve seen it too much and it makes me really sad.

35,"This is exactly my thoughts!

I'm biased because I'm a cat person but I do think cats require much less energy than dogs and can be a better companion if you're so depressed that getting up and taking care of yourself is too much.

Cats don't need walks, most of the time they want to be near you but don't necessarily want you to interact with them, but they do want to get fed and have their litter box cleaned.

And they will not let you forget that you need to do those things- and because it's your responsibility to ensure they get those things, that's enough for me to at least do that for them and then that kind of pushes me into a routine of having to do other things around the house that maybe I would have made an excuse to not get up for.

They made everything worse by disregarding certain caps on capitalism (hope im using this word correctly).
What i mean is, they left a grey area for businesses and rich people to get insanely rich without holdback of consequences. This is part of what ultimately led to the enormous gap between rich and poor. Another thing would be the CO2 emissions which no one has cared about since cars were invented and factories started using coal to power anything and everything.

Many of the films, books and other stories that we grew up with are post-WW2, corresponding to one of the most hopeful and positive trending (with a few hiccups...) times in human history. There was a real sense that the worst is behind us, that people are coming together rather than moving apart and that whatever problems face us, humanity will work until they are solved. 

This makes reaching adulthood and seeing the sorry state of things all the more depressing. We face more planet-level problems than ever before - Global warming, nuclear war, antibiotic resistance, ""alternative facts"", biodiversity collapse... the list goes on.

Also consider that economic depressions have a lasting and widespread effect on people's mental state. This depression actually has worse conditions for the people that weren't rich when it started, than the one in the 1930s. The Great Depression was really difficult for the rich. This depression is hitting the poor, so it gets downplayed a lot. 

I fully support people deciding to have, or not have kids. Many people are deciding to not have kids. Unfortunately, it seems like a lot of the most rational people are the ones deciding to not have kids. While many of the people that still do decide to parent kids are more authoritarian, sometimes extremely religious, etc. This one is just a personal observation, but it feels like a lot of parents of kids currently 10-25 are trying to raise kids in a regressed environment designed to repeal all the progress we've tried to achieve in the last 30 years. In a different time, those kids would be surrounded by other kids being raised with a different perspective. But because the people with the different perspectives aren't having kids, more of you are coming up with similar backgrounds, which I imagine would make you feel a kind of isolation. 

Schools. And yes, I know some of you will say, ""my school is great and I love it."" If that's so, I'm relieved and happy for you. But, let's face it. Schools, especially US public ones have become little more than the training version of juvenile detention. When my boomer parents went to school, hazing, teasing, and mild bullying started around 9th or 10 grade. Before that, they were treated as gentle little Beaver Cleaver children. [Leave it to Beaver, starring Jerry Mathers.] When I went to school, we got to be Beaver Cleavers until 5th grade. Middle school was brutal. For my kid? Third grade. More bullying. It's more brutal. Lots of talk about it, but no one does anything real about it. Terrorists attacking schools. Lunch fines. Cops and security guards that treat kids as the enemy. People were in such a rush to get kids babysat they barely cared about covid spreading at school. Kids being Baker Acted out of elementary school. Schools are dismal places for most kids, especially those that aren't rich enough for better options. I can literally get depressed right now by just thinking about middle school too much. 

I'm sure there's some biological info, too, but I don't have anything on that. Whatever generation you and your audience are, just know you guys aren't the first to experience widespread threats to mental and physical health. It happens, and it tends to be the stuff someone else's generation will read about or watch documentaries about. If you're under 25 or 30 now, a hard part is that a lot of people older than you won't acknowledge your struggles.

As we kept advancing, we developed traits that would keep us alive that didn’t translate into anything useful when we didn’t need them anymore. Now we call that a mental illness.

\-lots of people have homes but less time outside in the sun.

\-women were always just considered 'hysterical' for all the mental health problems.

\- nobody cared back then. If you were too depressed to work, you didn't eat and you died. If you were too anxious...it was the same. There are more options now than dying from starvation.

41,"I honestly think that it’s due to having parents who don’t understand the world we’re living in. For example, parents cannot relate to having unlimited internet access at age 6. Also, most baby boomer parents cared more about their jobs than raising a family. 

Also, it’s difficult to work and be productive in society. There never used to be child labour laws and every child used to have a job during the summer. This kept children busy and feeling that they were needed. Now, children don’t have that. They instead have to go to camp, which can be traumatizing for children who don’t make friends easily or just aren’t ready for camp. 

Also, school has become extremely competitive. Before, you could graduate high school, become a secretary and work your way to the CEO. Now, universities are offering degrees in Retail Management, implying that one needs a university degree to become a retail manager. ... furthermore, it is so difficult to even get a job with the rise of robots and technology. Going to university is no longer seen as prestigious. Instead, universities are ranked and people think they can somehow say that someone else’s degree is more superior to another’s based on the university they attended. For me, I have a very decent CGPA but I can’t seem to get accepted to a decent master’s program and I can’t find a full time job. I literally received rejection letters from Walmart and the Home Depot to be a cashier.

We do too much comparing, we’re being raised by people who don’t understand nor care to understand new problems and there is a lack of opportunity available to make something of yourself.

Me: Why don't you ask your parents if they'll make plans for you to hang out in person?

teen: I don't really want to I can just talk to them through text/video games.

Me: Why?

Teen: I don't really care about driving

Me: Don't you want to get out and go places and do things?

Teen: Not really. I can just play games and talk to friends at home


Also parents not being insistent on their children having lives. It's inexcusable parents aren't insisting in extra curricular activities, jobs, spending quality time with friends, getting their licenses,  doing things outside of the house. I often wonder what ARE these parents doing!? 

Kids are addicted to screens, they have no exposure to any activities besides social media, video games, and school work, which is also all on screens now. They feel sad, anxious, depressed, moody and their little know it all friends say ""You have depression, ADHD, OCD, Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar, etc."" So they think something is wrong with them because they believe their peers over trained professionals such as myself (which is understandable given their age) 

They're so absorbed in their devices even when they're in the cars they have no concept of their surroundings its actually incredible.

47,"I can give you my two cents on the subject. I think the main reason is because our reality was completely flipped onto its head. 

We started in a mostly analog world and over the course of our teenage years, everything shifted to digital.

We were told, our entire lives, that the key to success was to graduate high school, go to college, get a nice job, and buy a home. Then the housing bubble popped right as we were exiting high school, the markets that we were told to go into became over saturated, and we were given no guidance on how to shift into a new model of success.

Our entire futures were hinging on the idea that we could just get a degree, and have a good life, but when the markets crashed and the economy tanked, everything changed and nobody attempted to try and help us figure it out. We were left on our own and told that we were lazy, useless, good for nothing whiners who just wanted a hand out. In reality, we just wanted help in navigating a new world that unfolded in front of us and completely contradicted everything we were taught growing up.

So now, fast-forward to today... we're starting to figure it out, we have the gig economy that's working a little bit, some self-made people, and we're learning about how blue collar work is paying more these days, because they need people to replace the old heads. But all of the other generations still shit on us, they shit on everything we liked, everything we loved, and make fun of us, despite the fact that we are overcoming incredible odds to find new pathways to success.

We're depressed because we feel lied to, like our entire childhood was a lie, like we were lead to believe something that never came true, and we banked our whole futures on it. When that didn't happen, all we got was ""Didn't work out... tough... figure it out."" not even so much as an apology for ruining the economy just as we were entering it, nothing but ridicule and insults.

TL;DR We're mentally fucked up because someone else fucked up the economy just as we were coming of age, and everything we were taught about success was fucked with it.",,uym9cr

We put so much unnecessary pressure and competition on little kids, many starting with freaking pre-school. I pretty much had this experience through high school and I feel like it permanently burned me out for higher education. I dropped out of my university after 4yrs. I went right after high school even though I told my parents I wanted to take a gap year. Well since we’re in the USA, it got shut down bc I’d lose my health insurance through my parents. The way GPA’s have inflated its absolutely insane. The highest is ever seen someone get in 06’ was like a 4.2. Also, controlling kids and being a helicopter parent does tend to cause these issues. Kids need to be able to navigate danger (like climbing a tree, top of a jungle gym) bc it helps brain development and risk assessment. It also builds confidence. Other issue is that, I’m assuming you’re gen z, y’all have never lived a life not connected to the internet/social media and been fed unhealthy shit through it y’all’s entire lives.

1. Covid- Caused emotional/physical isolation. Stress. Fear. Depression
2. Inflation- Stress, Anxiety
3. Ukraine- Fear, Stress, Horror, Anger
4. School Shootings(USA)- Fear, stress, anger, depression, panic
5. School Competition- Stress, Depression over worthlessness
6. Social Structure- Constant need to be trendy. Constant changes
7. Openness- There have been mental illness in the past, sure. But now it’s more in the open, so more prevalence in society. Much confusion
8. Hustle- Constant need to get things done. Panic
9. Pressure to fix world- global warming, racism, hunger, poverty, etc causes stress
10. Burden of guilt- bear knowledge of country’s previous actions
11. Parents- Can’t adapt to modern era. Always refer to when they were kids. Sense of disconnect
11b. Unsupportive parents- Older generation have more strict view and view the newer generations as weaker(my parents) and are unsupportive of actions in modern era
12. Time- too much time alone. Allows people to think on problems. Depression",QuestioningAboutAria,uym9cr

96,"I’m 100% certain that people talked about their feelings with their loved ones since antiquity. 

I assume that their families, to the extent that they could, cared for them and those who needed exceptional care might be widely cared for by the community, send for frequent healings, or may under have been sent away maybe to a religious place or another kind of facility depending upon a combination of the culture and the given time period. 

My cousin is Nigerian American (dad immigrated) & African American (mom). His dad’s side is Christian, his mom’s side is more grounded in Afro-American spiritual traditions which include Christianity, but also include more animist beliefs. He’s not really connected with his tribe or traditional tribal customs, nor is he at all well-versed in less mainstream Afro-American spiritual systems and he seems to wonder a lot about the different opportunities he might have in traditionalist environments, both with regard to his likelihood of having a place in society as well as having options for addressing trauma and mental/spiritual illness in a different way than you’ll find in Western medical systems.

Well, but everything is flawed anyway and everyone sees it, knows it, but changing it would mean people have to work for real, and do some progress, not just go for titles and do the jobs half-assly while being corrupt and jobs being fill-in with CEO's fam members first, unable for new people, or new to job market, to have job...?

Also, rig the game by assly doing the ""in need for fresh graduate with 10 yrs of XPs"" bullshit???!

But then, it looks like THIS here (well, can be over-valuing the things, but, this is how it shouldn't, but still, somewhat, works! Not 100% true or I am blatantly hyped upon this - yet, as I said, nothing changes as it means there would be lot of improvement - and so forth;

the point is - nobody have money and time for this (also, schools are -you wonder- undervalued, underfunded and stuck in 1860s, go figure). They want cheap labor force, who don't ask... (Hehe, F451, 1984, Catcher in the rye - why not 😝)",press_F13,uym9cr

Who fixes the houses when they fall into disrepair? Do you expect people to just step up and handle all that out of compassion? What would you do for others in that world?

Also, religion aside. Historically speaking, humans change a lot. What is considered “human nature” changes all the damn time. Hell, there are people out there who act nothing like humans due to their upbringing. The only guarantee in humans is that we’re all different. Saying it’s a fact “humans overall can’t change” is just false.

Lastly, you literally state an example where humans are evolving and changing. “I believe some humans will change, the rest will just die.” That is evolution. The preferred or strongest will survive while the weakest/undesirable die off. That is Darwinism(aka a form of evolution). 

I don’t care what your personal beliefs are. My point is that saying “humans can’t change” is a lie. And that thinking such isn’t a positive thing. Not all humans will or can change, but humans in general, do change, and quite frequently.",Jayyd23,uym9cr

Some suggestions of new things to try/ learn about could be 

-Learn new ways to cook that seem more difficult than your used to
-Learn an outdoor skill like fishing, shooting, archery or foraging
-Learn to skateboard, rollerskate, rollerblade or even hoverboard 
-Learn how to whittle (seriously, one of the easiest hobbies to get into and very rewarding) 
-Try more fun ways of working out like sports or dance 
-Teach yourself how to play an instrument 
-Try your hand at coding

Religiously oriented goals are well supported, but are at least somewhat limited to religious people (or people who like relation).

Psychologically as you may have studied, people in authoritarian roles as well meaning as they want to be can sometimes get pushy and yes abusive knowing that the patient is sick and probably not well enough to sue or get legal counsel against the institution. There was this guy I played cards with in the ward that got wrestled to the ground and locked up in isolation with someone sticking a needle in his arm to sedate him. The reason? He took a tv remote and decided to lie about having it. I thought they were way too harsh on him but he has no family no confidence no self worth. I saw him strapped to a bed with tears in his eyes and he was a 50 something year old Asian man playing cards with me 10 minutes before. It made this place seem scary to me.

Sometimes getting your regularly scheduled meds requires an act of congress, and I really appreciate when nurses are empathetic, even if the answer is still ""I need you to wait,"" like the outcome is the same but when they are compassionate about saying ""no"" or ""hold on"" it helps a lot.",Theaterismylyfe,wqersx

My stint in a psych ward left me with lasting trauma due to vile nurses who lacked basic empathy, who made me feel trapped and violated, who I watched tackle kids and lock them in dark windowless rooms as punishment, who didn’t allow me the space to cry and be upset without pushing me out into a room full of other people staring at me during my mental breakdown. Some even interrogated me during group sessions about my ethnicity and denied my identity as well. I relied on other patients there to feel safe and sane. It was an humiliating experience all around. Unfortunately all of the nurses were like this. 
It happens when you’re in a position of authority and power over some of the most vulnerable of our population. Psych wards are essentially glorified asylums. Some lucky few walk away from them feeling helped, but many aren’t so lucky.

I refused and just tried to read until I eventually fell asleep. That was the biggest thing that was awful was when the nurses didn’t listen.

I honestly should have been hospitalized due to how severe my depression got. Ever since that experience all I have wanted to do was to help those who feel the way I have and have compassion toward their situation. Many people around me refused to listen to me or would tell me they didn’t understand how I was feeling and it only made me spiral more.

Then she sighs and goes well I already recorded in my log that you took it so just take it and get some sleep. I politely told her I am already tired and don’t need what I assumed was likely a benzo if I remembered. She told me if I’m causing problems, I might not get to leave in 72 hours. I told her I’m not trying to cause problems, I just don’t want to take any drugs I don’t know much about. Im basically at a stand still with this lady for 30 minutes then she tells me I’m going to be listed as “difficult” if I don’t take these pills. I told her, “I’ll take this pill this one time but I refuse to take any more of this stuff tomorrow or in the future…” she then scoffs and leaves me alone and refuses to talk to me the rest of the time I’m there.

Let mr know if you have any tips. If you havent already figured it out you should look into a depression/anxiety therapy called TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation). It really helped me. May help you. I take Kratom and it also helps. Is good for bad moments. Its legal in US and some other places. As long as you get the dose right it would put me right to sleep in a panic. Not for everyone and it works like an opiate but far safer. Its in the coffee family so about as risky as coffee with the exception for if you take too much so just start at a low dose. Anyways I hope that helps It is great to have a plan B and C and even an in case of emergency or a lifeline.

Cry. It’s healthy. You want to sleep all day and cuddle something? Do it if soothes you. You want to take care of yourself, even if that includes doing “girly things” like face masks and bath bombs?

It’s real unfortunate that sharing any human emotions is a sign of weakness. Even as a female I feel uncomfortable sharing them because I feel people will look down on me . But I can’t imagine how it is for men...I would like to ask guys how they are really doing , but I feel like they won’t tell me even if I asked. 

Society conditioned us to believe men are supposed to hold everything in...even though it may lead to looking tough on the outside , it makes men more insecure and no way to release .

I cannot recommend enough the book ""Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy"" by David D. Burns. It's currently free on Kindle Unlimited, even.

Just don't give up hope or on yourself, KEEP speaking until SOMEONE hears you. Seriously, men not being heard, and expected not to have emotions is a terrible problem we have going on.

I will also talk to a therapist since they are being payed to listen and ask about my well-being so I'm not a burden and as a 3rd party don't know of anyone that I talk about.

25,"Find a way to connect to your breath. Put your hands on your chest and notice your rib cage rising and falling with each breath. Notice your muscles in your body, what feels tight. Say it's your shoulders, can you roll or shrug your shoulders, does it feel looser now? How about your back, do you need to give it a little stretch?  

This will sound weird, but if you stand up, bounce on your toes to loosen up a bit, and then start shaking your arms, then your legs, then just shake your whole body out - make funny faces, make whatever noises come out. Do this regularly. Any time you get stuck in your head, remind your brain you have a body. 

Once you finish shaking yourself out, see if you can notice an emotion and where you might be feeling it. ""I'm feeling defeated right now and I feel it in my solar plexus/heart/belly,"" wherever it is. Then just notice it. If you start to feel overwhelmed, remember you are good at surpressing your emotions and you won't let it hurt you. 

Get out into nature as much as you can. Try to notice what's around you rather than pay any attention to the thoughts circling.

28,"Sounds like you have two issues you’re struggling with: you have trouble expressing yourself (probably for several reasons), and you feel like you have no one to express yourself to. Seems like you’re internalizing those problems, too, blaming yourself for having unmet social-emotional needs. 

There’s no real easy way through it, but it usually involves a combination of recognizing and accurately naming your feelings, developing effective coping skills, and finding supportive resources to keep in your life. It takes a while, and finding a therapist who works well with you helps, but with progress, the big emotions won’t feel so overwhelming and you’ll feel like you have options with how to handle hard stuff in your life. 

School can definitely be really hard. You’re in a small community and there are very few examples of people using healthy emotional skills. Everyone is all impulse all the time and there’s no curriculum for mental wellness, so you just get to try to figure everything out on your own. 

I don’t envy you - school was a nightmare for me at times too - but it does get easier. Kids grow up, people learn how to not be sociopaths, and your world expands just by continuing to exist.

39,"I cannot imagine being a man in today’s culture of toxic masculinity. As a female with mental health issues... I’m often told “It can’t be that bad”, “You’re just lazy”, “What do you have to be sad about?”, “Is it that time of the month?”, etc. 

I imagine it must be 100x worse for you guys. I heard someone say a while back that guys are only allowed to have two emotions: happiness and anger. It’s disgusting. 

I know there finally came a point with my mental health where I stopped hiding it. (I didn’t tell people for YEARS because of the stigma). Now just about everyone who knows me knows I suffer with depression and anxiety and it’s been so bad that I’ve been hospitalized on a number of occasions. Obviously, some people look at my like I have a third eye and run the other way when I casually mention my stays in the loony bin. That’s fine. I don’t need judgmental people in my life anyways. But I’ve also been surprised at the number of people who have told me I was brave and that they admired me. Some have even opened up about their own struggles.

Being open and honest about my mental health... developing that “fuck what anyone thinks about it attitude” has been the best decision I’ve ever made. If you can find it in you... I encourage you to think about doing the same. The only way we are going to end this stigma is by talking about it.

But with that being said... it took me years to get to that point. And if you don’t want to go that route, that is okay too. We are unique individuals with unique situations. I just wanted to throw that idea out there.

48,"Very well said.  I have yet to be asked 'how I am' either.  Thanks for your topic here!

Lots of talk, zero action.  I appreciate those who actually do care, the heartfelt ones, not the narcissitic ones.  Unfortunately, the stigma still exists, regardless of our advanced intellectual understanding and objectiveness in this Information Age, our Utopia of political correctness and Quality of Life indices.  The ""melting pot"" has a wide scope of expectation and you better fit within the parameters....or else.

Man, you have hit the nail on the head.  You have expressed what I have felt for 45 years. Never, have I ever, run into the perfect compact version as you have seemingly dictated so naturally expressed here.  I believe our world is existential and what I have lived through my whole life is 'the existential angst', as with most peeps with my mental health condition(s).

All my intelligence that has been so incredibly hard to obtain has only fooled me into thinking I was normal.  I don't know how to release my feelings and only humiliate myself in the process of trying to do so.   The constant feeling of defeat, constant negativity, always feeling held down, simply not being able to get there from here.  

In my humble opinion, I think you have begun to describe reality for sooooo many. KUDOS.

I feel like I have been a burden to absolutely every single person I have encountered in my personal life.  I am a SQUARE PEG that has to fit into the world of ROUND HOLES.  Nobody cares.  Nobody wants you to express yourself because you have competely and rationally evaluated all the shit you see, all day, every day, for years.  You know your arguement is perfect and you are absolutely correct in your evaluation of whatever piece of shit issue that knocked you on your ass in the first place.  Nobody wants to hear it.  You are damaging their bubble, their impossible life. Your respect for the masses, the status quo, diminishes with your dignity.  You don't want to be this person but you don't want to be like them really.  Can you really forget what you know is to be true so you can meld with the wrong peeps?  I feel degraded when I attempt it because digressing is not the answer.

The contradictions between the logic, the rule, the law, the moral, the community value... and reality.  The grey-area that makes you feel like you 'wish I could feel like everyone else, how they just don't care and live life'.  I have to wear a seatbelt to save only me and will be punished with a traffic ticket, yet I go to a party in the middle of COVID-19 outbreak in June with 6 cops there, no one wearing masks; I get it, my beautiful child gets it, my beautiful grandchild gets it (thanks to luck I never actually got it).  The cost to society is pnenominal, the contradiction, the incredible stress of dealing with life and death.  Another source of night terrors, maybe for you too.

You have expressed yourself with objectivity on something absolutely subjective and very emotional.  I think I understand you well.  I cannot teach you apathy.  I cannot teach you to not carry the world on your shoulders.  I cannot dumb you up so you cannot come to those obvious conclusions in the real reality, so to speak.

I am too old to change the world.  I can't shake this myself, but hope you can join the masses in their bubble so you can finally be happy and normal.  I honestly wish I could, but ya can't teach an old dog new tricks.

Sorry for the book here.  I am good at building clocks.  I don't know how to defend my good thoughts and stay passionate about what is right.  I don't know how to turn it off.  I have lived a life of suvival....fight or flight, since birth.  I never learned proper behaviour, yet I was taught it.   Nobody can really expand on this topic to raise a solution.  This is a sociological condition that has simply migrated into this AGE OF STUPID.  You are right... Nobody Cares.

Please keep loving the peeps.  All of 'em.  Don't blame them for not being anywhere near as intelligent as you.  Don't blame them for not caring...they simply cannot handle the reality of the damage they cause every minute of every day.  They are the moral majority now and you cannot fight them.  They will continue to destroy the earth with their consumption because they are told they have to in order to 'live', and they are not a smart as you.

I learned to laugh at them and poke pins into their bubbles, at least in my mind's eye.  I suggest you do your best not to fight the system, because it will just fill your head with more loss.  Sit back and watch 'em fuck it all up.  They will always lie to you by the tablecloth.

This fight for right is of course, right.  But the good wholesome pricipals that are right in front of you mean nothing to anyone but you and I.",MentalmanIQ,jh0txb

With regards to males mental health being ignored well basically I have professional help (so technically I’m not), but yes people tend to look down on you for appearing ‘weak’, asking for support and generally not always there. Males mental health is stigmatised. As for stoicism I brought this up as I admit I don’t have a support network outside of therapy, it’s a way of processing experience; hardship but by no means does it mean be tough. It can be also tough to be kind and more worrisome to lose that kindness lacking in the world. It’s expected of us that we ought to ‘man up’ and yes I disagree, what I said I think is a misunderstanding and I can see how I got on the wrong foot.

I was also just buying small amazon packages at the time, and was dealing with my relationship OCD (so less time spent in the apartment = less time for me to think about living with my partner).

Eventually, my BF turned this compulsion into a joke. Whenever I lost something, i.e. cell phone, keys, purse… my Bf will ask if it’s in the mailbox. And it will turn into him repeating that phrase until it just becomes a joke and the compulsion is gone. I stopped checking the mailbox to spite him so he wouldn’t repeat the phrase.

This has also worked with depression and him hugging me into the bed saying “how can you do xyz when you can’t get out of bed?” It would be repeated after every single thing I said.

They believe that only thought generates belief, when in fact it is more complex than that.  However, my view, although empirically better, is not scientific.  However, to test it, the cost is zero.  To use the technique I described, it is enough that you understand something that just thinking about causes you anxiety.  Ex: ""does an empty room cause anxiety? No? So the problem is people. Do people need to be looking at you for you to feel anxiety? Yes? So the problem is the judgment you think it's possible for them to have inside their minds"" .",-ZaneTruesdale-,1cifzlf

Anger was the one emotion that showed me that it wasn’t okay or normal. Because I do love the people in my life but my anger/fear makes it nearly impossible for me to handle being in a relationship.

41,"I would say that when you are convinced that your reality is unchallenged by the perspective of others you have gone full on psychotic. This is from personal experience (18 years hearing voices/having constant auditory hallucinations) as well as observing others in various programs and substance use/abuse. When your reality is unquestionable you have crossed the line into a place where both your perspective of what reality truly is (albeit questionable and esoteric) and your memories begin taking on a quality of unhealthy mental attributes. From this place, it is difficult to fully remove these experiences from your consciousness, and non-psychotic thinking can still add to these experiences in an unfortunate but linear chain of thought.",Broad_Ring1269,16m1u2z

You may want to consider professional help or counselling so that you and your wife are able to healthily express or communicate this healthily and so that it will also be regulated.

My parents did not handle their trauma in a healthy way and me and my siblings and I are absorber of their difficulties and shortcomings, especially as parents.

They are co-dependent and almost blamed us for most of our misfortunes because they handled things in toxic ways like cheating, drinking excessively, and hurting us physically even if we make slight mistakes.

Me and my siblings and I are entirely affected, and the parent's trauma passed onto us, but we are trying our best to deal with this in our own healthy ways.

I'm an artist, and I can't be arsed to have distractions... how much that's a part of my mental illness, I'll leave in the middle

I wouldn't say I date people with a mental illness exclusively, but I found that dating them, helps more to have some understanding, with my own issues, but also avoids arguments about work, money, and such things, because they're likely in the same boat.

That said... I dated mostly women on the autism spectrum; I seem to pick them out, even if some got a diagnosis later in life.

The older I get, the more I realize that I'm way too much for people... between autism, and being manic from bipolar, it's never a dull moment with me, but if you're in your late 30s or early 40s, a lot of people that showed interested, would prefer someone a bit less intense. And I'm not exactly getting more calm and such... and I'm quite a loud and confident extrovert,  which doesn't always gel with everyone.

Start by nurturing your mind with activities that bring joy and peace, whether it's reading a favorite book, practicing mindfulness, or taking leisurely walks in nature. Seeking support from loved ones and professionals can provide invaluable guidance and encouragement along the way. Remember, small steps can lead to significant progress, so celebrate every milestone, no matter how small.

Additionally, prioritize self compassion and acceptance, recognizing that setbacks are a natural part of the journey. Embrace moments of vulnerability and allow yourself the grace to grow and evolve. Ultimately, finding what works best for you is key, so explore different techniques and strategies until you discover what resonates most deeply. Trust in your resilience, and know that with dedication and self kindness, you can cultivate a healthier, more fulfilling mental landscape.",Anonymouse7430,1bsb9bk

3,"As someone who’s depression has settled into his bones by now I’ll give you a couple pointers for some smaller things that may help.

1. Addiction and Depression are an evil pair. Dont use short term dosages of serotonin to counter balance the lack there of. Manage your alcohol, your weed, your cigarettes, etc. 

2. Learn to live with the mediocre. Your highs aren’t going to feel the same, your lows will feel even lower. I practice Stoicism to help manage these feelings but finding some way to ground yourself and help you accept this reality is a good idea.

3. Learn to ignore the voice in your head until you’re able to overcome it. Your inner voice is going to be your enemy. It will say things no one would ever have the bones to say. It’s wrong, it’s nothing more than the serotonin starved part of your brain turning in on itself. Learn to ignore it then learn to fightback. Conflict is tiring, but conflict means change, and change is better than stagnation. 

4. And finally, slowly begin to compliment yourself for accomplishing things. Retrain the voice to say nicer things. It’s going to sound stupid, it’s going to feel pointless, but you’re brains a dog baby, and she needs to be retrained. Look yourself in the mirror and say, “I’m proud of you for doing X, Y, or Z.” Say it to yourself when doing a chore, or reaching a goal in a video game, before you go to sleep.  We only have ourselves in the end, lets try to be a friend.

I hope this helped.",rakdosleader,1bsb9bk

5,"I think improving your poor mental health is a lot of undoing bad habits you learned in childhood, so I would start taking notes about what those are. Are there typical things you do you know are bad for you, like over/under-eating, staying up late, procrastinating, overworking as a side effect of perfectionism etc? Are there typical fears and anxieties that plague you, or do you repeat common put downs about yourself, like do you tell yourself what an idiot you are or how no one likes you?

Once you start making a list, then you can work your way down the list to undo those things bit by bit. 

For example: If you feel too shy and avoid socializing as a result, start by talking to yourself in the mirror and telling yourself things that are good about you. Lie if you can't think of anything. Don't worry about how silly it feels and just tell yourself the things you want to be ie ""You're confident"" ""You're capable"" ""You're a bad bitch"". And then work up to using that to convince yourself that you should go out and have fun, because of course a confident, capable bad bitch deserves to have fun.",Ryn_AroundTheRoses,1bsb9bk
6,"Take it one step at a time, One day at a time. Don't think about tomorrow, don't think about next week, don't think about next month. All that matters is the next step in front of you.

Unfortunately, this tends to be easier said than done so try to be easy on yourself when you don't have a perfect day. I have several mental disorders (Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, ADHD) along with Autism. I'll be the first to admit most of my days usually aren't good. Despite that, Taking each day one step at a time has helped tremendously with getting through the bad days.

Also, make time for hobbies and other activities you enjoy. Other commenters have left great ideas for things you could do so I won't repeat what others have said here. Having to do nothing but work/school all day 24/7 really sucks and very rarely (at least in my experience) improves your mental health.

The unfortunate part about mental health is trying to find what works for you. All the while, you're in pain and all you want to do is make the pain go away. I struggled with this for years, delay after delay, setback after setback.

I hope you can find what works for you soon. Be kind to yourself, be kind to others. Take care",Snoo_22635,1bsb9bk

2. Wake up and get some sun right away. Even just briefly looking at the sun from a window
3. Exercise - do at least some mild exercise daily, like free weights. Go on long walks or jogs 2-3x week. No matter how much you may not want to move, I guarantee you exercise is the best form of medicine for all sorts of brain cooties
4. Stay hydrated : look up how much water to consume based on weight
5. Stay away from symptom doom scrolling on internet- will only make it worse and introduces supplements which….btw
6. Eat at least moderately healthy,  3 meals and Stay away from supplements. A simple B-complex can spike anxiety for some. Unless specifically recommended by a doctor for known deficiency, stay away. If you are careful and found supplements that “work” - make sure to discuss with a doc or pharmacist. A lot of supplements touted for mental health, like magnesium, NAC, can cause bad reactions for many. Magnesium Glycinate , the “miracle anxiety and sleep” nutrient, can actually induce insomnia and severe anxiety in some. Calcium levels, and all sorts of other variables could churn that glycine into excitatory glutamate. NAC is well known to cause severe anhedonia in many after repeated use.

Even fish oil, usually cheap ones that go rancid, can wreak havoc on you!

130,"I was having some short term counselling through the health service here, and because I'd had it before, I knew that they were able to do up to 12 weeks depending on need. 

Well...I know they're overstretched by a lot, but this particular counsellor was *determined* that we would be done within the shortest allowed timeframe of 6 weeks. She would bring it up all the time. 

""Remember, you only have 5...4...3...weeks left"" 

Multiple times a session. 

Anyway, it gets to week 6 and despite my questionnaires not having improved and despite me explicitly telling her that I was very worried about not having more counselling and not feeling ready to stop and please was there any chance I could do a couple more sessions...she's like; 

""Well you've had short term counselling before and you know it doesn't work if you don't follow the advice given which is why you keep relapsing. I think you need to have long term counselling.""

Now despite everything, I did actually agree with that last part. However, long term counselling is usually private and very expensive, and I simply could not afford it at the time, which I told her. 

She responded, and I am honestly not over emphasizing, although I wish I were; 

""Well, you know, it's about investing in yourself isn't it? And if you can't even do that you're never going to get better. Ok? Ok, good. You take care now!""

Just because you had the money to go to the therapist, and you are clinically ill, doesn't mean that somebody who never did is not. We cannot feel each other's emotions fully, so we shouldn't judge. 

It might sound offensive, but it really isn't. I am suffering from strong social anxiety. I have been since I remember. You don't even know. That feeling of stress. That feeling of pain, regret, wondering what if... It was all I did. All I focused on was me and my problem. and you know what? It became even worse and worse. 

Finding out that I'm not alone and it's not that uncommon made me cry. I don't know if they were the tears of sadness, or tears of joy. But still I was focused on it. I don't need to pay 300$ to the therapist so he can tell me that I am sick. I don't want to be categorized based on this. I am just trying to be somehow normal, to feel normal, to feel relaxed. 

What's my point? We are all sick. Some of us show it, some of us fight the demons inside. We should be more understanding and forgiving for each other. And we definitely shouldn't romanticize and elitize it, if we want to feel better about ourselves.",IfallInLove2easily,16goprr

I struggle with anxiety generally and this past year I had months of very bad insomnia caused by sleep anxiety (vicious cycle where worrying about not sleeping leads to more sleeplessness). It was very scary, and the way most people (including doctors) responded was not helpful. They were either super alarmed (like I’m scared enough myself, please calm down) or recommended sleep hygiene practices (which I was already doing).

Anyway, I think there’s different factors that can cause sleep troubles, but if you feel like yours might be caused by sleep anxiety, I’d recommend “The Sleep Book” by Guy Meadows and/or “The Sleep Coach School” channel on YouTube by Daniel Erichsen. Both were immensely helpful to me. Overall they recommend an acceptance approach to insomnia which paradoxically can help sleep come easier over time.

218,"I hear you, but I don't agree. Everyone has low points in life, but not severe enough to not be able to work, or take care of yourself or suicide becoming a serious concern. Anyone can get mental issues like depression, but not everyone does. Many people seek help for depression after separations or losing some close, and they get medicine to get through it without going under, and after they can live a normal life without medication.

I have a cronic illness though and no, not all people have to struggle the way I do to stay alive and function normally. And accepting that I will have to limit things and take medication every day until I die is not making it my personality. I have an illness that affects my mood and is an explanation to why I sometimes can't be my happy, social self. 

Please, please don't be a ""everyone gets sad"" person. A few % of people have life-threatening mental illnesses that can not be cured, and saying that is normal is belittling how dangerous it is. And it is to highlight this ignorance that I'm writing this book in the first place",jcash444,16goprr

Especially in the UK, where for some reason they are extremely reluctant to prescribe anything for insomnia or acknowledge it’s effects on quality of life at all. 

For starters, as soon as she heard how distressed I was, she immediately went back on her word and was like ‘oh, well, we could try Zolpidem’.

Secondly, she had never referred me for simple testing, such as hormone level analysis, or a sleep study to examine my circadian rhythms.

Even more stupidly, she had not even acknowledged the existence of off license options, like muscle relaxants or antidepressants with mechanisms that support the body’s natural sleep cycles. 

You wouldn’t say ‘well what do you expect? sometimes it’s the simplest solution’ to someone with intractable cancer being told they should just stop eating red meat and make sure they never apply to work at a power plant. 

What I expect is for clinical/medical professionals to know their shit better than their patients, provide thorough care, and not bullshit about being out of options just because they don’t want to deal with you.

But I feel like a lot of people with not that bad mental health think that they have the worst possible case and need pills to be happy. And while it's normalized, drugs aren't, when in reality they can have similar impact on your brain and overall health. So where is the line? It became trendy to be mental. It's easier to do nothing or just pop a pill than trying to make a change. If you are really working on yourself, and you just take meds temporary, to make it more effective, then fine. But it's hard not to get addicted and even more lost.  And because of it, people who want a change and need real help aren't heard nor understood. 

I'm kinda into mental health, and with everyday I just can see more and more traumatized people everywhere. Starting from my friends, through my family, to my little, lovely sister.

As I said earlier, I suffer from social anxiety, so I really get you. I can feel the loneliness, pain, regret, overthinking, stress. I am not saint. I did and probably still will do drugs from time to time. I will drink to feel relieved from this. It's like being unleashed from the chains. Heavy fucking chains. I am not normal. But it doesn't mean that I can't be really fucking awesome, haha. Looking 2 years back, I wouldn't believe where I am now. I wouldn't believe what do I do. But here I am. Still too socially crippled to ask the cashier for cigarettes, and still stressed before making a phone call like I was talking to the president of the US, but I will go and buy them for my mum if she asks me, or I will call the ambulance to save my girl from maybe even dying.

If you can afford it, I'd recommend getting a blood test to see if any of your vitamin/mineral/etc levels are lower than they should be. I feel a million times better when I remember to take my iron, vit c, and vit d tablets. But remember that if you're not lacking a certain vitamin, taking that vitamin will do nothing for you. For example, if your vitamin c levels are fine but you take vit c tablets anyway, you'll literally just piss out the excess. Which is why I recommend the blood test so you're not taking something unnecessarily. 

Also, unironically, make jokes about how cool you are. Even if you don't believe them. Stumble when you're walking? say something like ""wow, look how smooth I am today!"" instead of ""guess I'm so dumb I can't even walk straight"". Yes it'll be sarcastic. No, you won't believe it. But those posts you may have seen on social media about repeating these things over and over again (even if you don't mean them) were right.

Another thing that can have a huge impact is your understanding of your own psychology. Like what your mental health issue is, how it forms, and how you reinforce it.

Understanding bias is helpful. Especially your ability to notice confirmation bias. Repeating bad thoughts or messages your brain soaks up while avoiding opposing ones. Learning to control your attention will teach to control parts of your mind you didn't know you could.

Lastly another good one is dopamine detox or simply avoiding overstimulation in general.

1) find YOUR meaning of life, there is no one set meaning, what makes your life worth living?


2) take off the mask, be yourself, it hurts at first, but it feels so freeing and amazing.


3) kill the part of you that is cocky. It only destroys you, but do not destroy your confidence.


4) set a goal, do not say you’re gonna get a solid gold car within a month, put away whatever money you can each month, and save. Notice there is no deadline, and it isn’t unachievable.


5) notice beauty and struggle, life is yin and yang, sweet and sour, spicy and savoury, there is bad and good. Notice how individually they are overwhelming, but bring them together and it’s a beautiful balance.

6) embrace nature, nature is beautiful and perfectly imperfect. Connect with it, the feeling is so good, forage, climb trees, swim in a river, walk in mud, watch bugs, whatever it is, connect.


7) notice the “demon.” This demon that hides in shadows and cannot seem to be defeated, he or she is strong, you lock it away but it ALWAYS comes back stronger. Well, STOP fearing it. It ISN’T a monster, it is an aspect of you, it is not you, but part of you.

Regular exercise. Just 20-30 min 5-6 times a week. Nothing heavier fancy, sometimes just a walk. But it affects your brain chemistry very strongly and in a good way. 

Understanding mindfulness and practicing it daily. Understanding that most people in the world are doing the best they can. Accepting reality for what it is. Not allowing myself to feel sorry for myself for too long. 

Starting a real hobby that keeps me busy when my brain is on overload. I started doing pottery because it's calm and slow and it helps with the overfiring of signals in my brain.

Being able to recognize and catch myself when I'm in a negative thought cycle. Trying to play devil's advocate with myself.. do my emotions really match the situation? Should I really be this upset over something so small?

Medication does not ""Fix"" you. It simply allows lessens the effect of a disorder to allow you learn to cope with it.

Eg, depression medication doesn't make you happy, it suppresses your brains ability to get stuck in self deprecating logical loops, so you can focus on rebuild yourself and your image, as well as the world around you, instead of the prison within.

ADHD medication doesn't make you focus better. It fills in the dopamine deficiency in your brain that causes you to be easily distracted. Your ability to however, to properly manage task, and build support to get things done, is still something you need to develop, and medication allows you to do it.

I felt a glimmer of who I was before COVID and all the negative impacts the past 3 years have had on my life. I have only been doing the meditations routinely again since Jan 2nd. It's this subtle noticing that I can handle difficult conversations better (I don't even recognize myself during some interactions because I handle them so much better).

Secondly, when I can tell myself I'd like to stick to something and then I stick to it at all costs (unless I'm in legitimate danger, and trust me... my mind will try to find any excuse to resist consistency), I feel so much better. Being able to be consistent with myself is huge for my mental health. There's something about not self-abandoning when I don't feel like doing something or feel uncomfortable (but not in legitimate danger) that has significantly improved my mental health. And these don't even have to be big things for me. Last 6 months of last year I set a goal to floss my teeth every Monday/Wednesday/Friday. I can't tell you how many times I tried  talking myself out from having to do it. Sticking with it always supported me in feeling better overall and anytime I'd self-abandon and crawl into bed because I just didn't feel like doing it, when the internal resistance won, I'd always feel poorly. Now I have successfully flossed my teeth every day since Jan 1 (yep, this was my new years resolution :-P) and I genuinely feel proud of myself because of the consistency, as small as it might seem.

Also, anytime I am in connection with people who love and care about me, my mood significantly improves. It's sooooo soooo sooo hard for me to be around people when I don't feel mentally well. And time and time again, when I do the opposite of what my depression tells me to do, and I spend time with people who love me, I feel so much better. And life gets put into perspective a bit better for me (it's good to get outside of my  own head as often as possible).

It kind of like cuts off the thinking and refocuses my attention to the physical sensation, it is honestly wild how impactful it has been for me. So basically, if I am feeling anxious I ask myself ""where do I sense it in my body"".

236,"Ok I’m going to speak from my personal experience here. When I walked into AA eventually I decided that I want what these other people have.

If I want what they have, I’m going to do what they do. Full willingness. I’m not going to work the steps my way, or work my version of AA. I have a sponsor and I do the work as it’s presented to me. I take my personal will out of it. 

I’m 6 months sober and on step 4 and 5. I’ve noticed changes along the way, but at this point my life is drastically changing for the better. Internally and externally. 

I look at going to meetings and staying with AA as taking my medicine. Similar to my mood stabilizer. If I want to be well, I need to take my medicine. I plan to stay with AA for the entirety of my life, and that sounds wonderful to me.

From there I will give it some compassion. I will tell that part of me / myself that ""I am going to be ok"", ""it is going to be ok"". And I try to breathe into the spot where I feel it. And the whole time I am really trying to observe the sensation, not resist or fight it.

22,"Your concern and consideration for the well-being of someone you love deeply, especially in the context of not wanting to ""drag them through your shit,"" speaks volumes about your empathy and self-awareness. It's a genuinely difficult situation to be in, feeling like you might be a burden to someone due to your own struggles. Here are a few thoughts that might help navigate this complex emotional landscape:

&#x200B;

**Love is a Two-Way Street**

Remember that relationships are built on mutual care, support, and understanding. While you're considering their well-being, it's also important to recognize that they likely want to support you through your challenges. Open communication about your feelings and fears can provide them with an opportunity to share their perspectives and desires in the relationship.

&#x200B;

**Honesty and Openness**

Being honest about what you're going through is crucial. It allows the other person to understand your situation better and decide how they can or want to support you. This doesn't mean you have to share every detail, but communicating your feelings and concerns can help prevent misunderstandings and build trust.

&#x200B;

**Self-Compassion and Worth**

It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking you're a burden, but it's important to challenge these thoughts. You are deserving of love and support, irrespective of the difficulties you're facing. Self-compassion involves recognizing this and treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding you'd offer a loved one in your situation.

&#x200B;

**Seeking Support**

If you haven't already, seeking support from a therapist or counselor can be incredibly beneficial. They can offer strategies to manage your difficulties more effectively, which in turn can help you feel less like you're ""dragging"" someone else down. Additionally, this can show your loved one that you're actively working on addressing your challenges.

**Balancing Independence and Support**

While it's important to lean on loved ones in times of need, finding a balance where you're also taking steps to manage your own well-being can alleviate some of the concerns about being a burden. This might include pursuing hobbies, joining support groups, or developing a self-care routine that helps you maintain a sense of independence.

&#x200B;

**Mutual Growth and Understanding**

Every relationship faces challenges, and navigating them together can lead to deeper understanding and growth for both partners. Your current struggles could offer opportunities for both of you to learn more about yourselves, each other, and how to support each other effectively.

&#x200B;

**Respect Their Autonomy**

Trust that the other person has the capacity to make their own decisions about what they can handle and what they want from the relationship. It's important to respect their autonomy and not make assumptions about how they might feel or react to your situation.

&#x200B;

Choosing to be open and vulnerable with someone about your struggles is an act of courage. It's also a testament to the depth of your care for their well-being. Just as you're considering their feelings and the potential impact on them, allow them the space to do the same for you. Relationships, at their core, are about navigating life's ups and downs together, supporting each other through the difficult times, and growing stronger as a result.",Key_Construction_279,1c0rxsx

24,Sort of.. about a month ago I was 5150 (then 5250) in the mental hospital for 10 days and also my first time being hospitalized. I did feel better In there towards the tail end and then got home and within a few days when right back to where I started so then it probably only took another week from there for me to start asking if it was something in my environment making me feel that way. There were a few other things with my bf too which is why My answer was sort of but yeah that was probably the driving factor of dumping the person I once thought I would marry. It was really hard. And honestly I still don't feel better,karmachameleon170,1c0rxsx

I don’t really regret it in hindsight, i don’t think we really were that great together. If I was in the same situation now with my current girlfriend, I would not do the same thing.

We were only 16/17 at the time and he didn't do any drugs. After a certain night of him comforting me while I was really sick and depressed I knew I had to end it...

38,"Yes. It was a typical high school relationship but we both got along swimmingly and really loved and cared for each other. But right as we turned 18, both of our mental health issues, undiagnosed entirely for both of us at the time, started to crop up. She had more going on than me at that time and I didn't know how to help or handle much outside of general anxiety and depression. This also lead to her not wanting to hear my struggles because she had too much going on. We kept that up for longer than we should have out of mutual love and respect but after 6 months of things just getting worse and worse for both of us, I had to pull the plug. It was the hardest thing I ever had to do and even now, six years later, I still think about it every day.

In those six years, she followed through on her plans for her career while i just took whatever came to me (thanks to survival mode and shitty parents) and never planned much of anything for myself, despite being someone with massive hopes and dreams, just not enough self belief or a support system. She's now been in a relationship longer than we were together. I've just been bouncing around casual hookups that have been disasterous for my mental health. 

Back in January I ran into her and her girlfriend at a NYE party and man that was a trip. She had figured it all out, got the exact job she wanted, was seemingly in a happy relationship, travels all the time, a thing we used to talk a lot about. It was weird - I had this immense sense of pride and happiness for her and what she had achieved, but it only strengthened that sense of what if.

Often times I regret that decision, don't get me wrong, things were kinda fucked for those last few months, but I still wonder what life could be like now if we'd actively both leaned more into growing through it together instead of apart.

Things have improved for me with the downside  that the more I find out (or the more awareness I have) the less I know … or think I know.  I’m a lot more communicative than I used to be but there’s still a blank where the “us” of being with other people should be… something just isn’t connecting in my head. 

From chatting to an online friend who has DID and whose experience is much the same, I’m fairly sure  there’s some level of dissociation there, a disconnect between my sense of self and what the rest of my brain gets up to.  I do feel like I watch my life rather than experiencing it.

Everyone feels anxious or sad or has a bad day sometimes or have things not work out well, but that doesn’t mean it’s anxiety or depression or trauma. There’s a difference between normal emotions and life ups and downs and actual disorders and trauma. The main things I do to help myself are with creative outlets. I guess what I hate the most is not being normal whether it’s with being trans or with PTSD. For example especially dealing with things intersectionally: if im dealing with someone that’s casually and blatantly transphobic that triggers my PTSD(cause I’ve had security called on me for being trans multiple times(but had PTSD before trans issues too)) I’ll start trembling and then said person starts talking about not being emotional…you can’t be hateful and expect people to not be upset and people act like they would support people with PTSD but then when I have symptoms they’re freaked out. It makes me feel terrible and weak.

You should tell them clearly that you are in danger of yourself, and that you want to be sectioned, that you’ve been given psych meds that are not working anymore. You might also consider reaching out to a loved one to ask for help. They might be able to advocate for you and have your back if you go to healthcare professionals such as a hospital again, and it might feel a bit less scary if you go together.

5,"I’ve been in CAMHS when I was 14 when I attempted suicide and was sectioned in numerous psych wards from age 17 to 21 and it was horrible. The rollercoaster of emotions of not being able to live my life and so many near misses. I’m covered with self harm scars from my arms legs and even on my neck (I almost died more than once).
My advice? Reaching out is the first step. But I have a question. Do you really want to be sectioned? It’s not a life, hell, I missed my adolescence and I couldn’t do what I wanted to. Like myself in my early days, you seem to be aware that you’re not well. Doctors will see that and won’t really help you unless you ARE a risk to yourself, which worries me because it can escalate into a self fulfilling prophecy. This is what happened to me …. I swallowed batteries, tried to electrocute myself, overdosed on 32 paracetamols etc 
Then I was given a section 3.
 I’ve been restrained, pinned down and injected with benzodiazepines and antipsychotics more times I can count. I was a drugged up mess at 17.
I’ve been put on 3:1 observations (that’s 3 people watching my every move, all day) with long term segregation (I had to stay in a room and was allowed to come out for an hour to watch TV) when I was 18. My room used to get stripped and I lost property and I was in what they call a sterile room. So I’d sit in an empty room. Staff where good but some of the staff where really unprofessional and couldn’t give a sh*t since they get paid minimum wage and were in it for the money.
This made my mental health worse and it became a cycle, the more I stayed there the worse I got.
I met a patient who was in hospital when he was 18 and he got shipped off to a care home.
Do you really want all that? 

I’m not dismissing your problems but what I am saying is go to your GP, open up to family and friends first. Make sure you be completely honest when you see the mental health team and I mean say everything. Try getting therapy for self harming. And if it is the case of being sectioned then make sure you do what you can to get better. I wish I did. Otherwise it’s difficult to get out. I’d have these tribunals when I thought I was ready to go home but they wouldn’t risk letting me get out after all the stuff I did.
And another thing drugs aren’t the ultimate solution. There isn’t one drug out there for mental health problems that 100% cures you without side effects. 
I used to think that when I was younger. I thought I was weird and I needed some medication to be normal (eg diazepam for my anxiety) I’m on really strong sedatives including antipsychotics, anti epileptics and benzodiazepines I sleep all day, sometimes 12+ hours.

13,"I've helped a lot of people with mental illnesses but do not have any of my own and here's what I think...

I think it depends on the mental illness. There's some that are so bad that they perceive reality in a totally different way. I believe that it would be unfair to expect them to have full control of their own actions when the very reality they are reacting to is so much different than ours.

However that is for the most extreme cases. I think there are a lot of people that do have a genuine mental illness but also scapegoat much of their personal responsibilities and accountability onto it. 

Take someone who suffers from paranoid delusions triggered by PTSD as an example. The flight or fight response is strong indeed however they owe it to themselves to learn how to disengage from the scenario, logically analyze the situation, recognize whether or not a threat does actually exist and its severity, and THEN act appropriately while considering their condition.

Edit: Also meds. If someone needs to take meds and chooses to stop taking them while on their meds and loses control when the meds wear off I consider them responsible for their actions just like many consider a person choosing to get drunk to responsible for theirs. They were in control of whether or not they would be in control later.

This of course would not be applicable if say...someone is lunging at them. Taking a swing at a perceived advancing threat would be a totally natural response regardless of whether or not they have control of their actions.

33,"Hello friend,



I agree with the deterministic point of view as well and unfortunately people seem to have a knee-jerk reaction against it when it's brought up.

I think the best argument I've found for it goes as follows:

First you have to define free will, which can generally be thought of as ""the ability to have acted differently"" if you were to turn back the clock.

Then, you establish that the two reasons you consciously do something are because you want to, or are forced to.

You clearly don't have any choice in being forced to do something, so the possibility of ""free will"" is ruled out in this case.

And when you think about why you want to do something, you don't really choose this either.

For example, let's say you get to choose between having vanilla or chocolate ice cream, and you chose vanilla. You didn't choose to want vanilla more than chocolate, you just happened to naturally like it more. If you chose to pick chocolate instead of vanilla even though you like vanilla more, it would mean you had the desire/want to pick chocolate even though you like it less, and this desire still is not ""chosen"" by you.

37,">> Yes, but ultimately the question is does society as a whole recognize that some people with mental health conditions are not fully in control of their actions, and by direction not fully responsible for them either?

I mean, there are criminal defenses in the court of law for this exact reason. So, the answer to your question is “yes”… but it’s not just for **any** mental illness, and there has to be to a degree of severity. 

The insanity defense isn’t for someone who’s severely depressed and decides to go shoot up a school as a result of it. Depression doesn’t severely alter your literal sense of reality - you still have cognizance of what you’re doing and have the capacity to stop and know what you’re doing is wrong. 

That defense is for people who are in a severe state of psychosis (ex: acute psychosis from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, postpartum psychosis, etc) where they have no appreciable ability to conceptualize their actions, which HAVE to be a direct consequence of psychosis itself. Ex: having delusions and hallucinations that you’re in a graveyard being attacked by zombies and, in self defense, you defend yourself… in actuality, you just assaulted a bunch of police officers.

In reference to one of the above examples from another commenter with the same defense: same logic applies - that woman was by definition in such a severe state of psychosis to where she literally had no way to conceptualize that she was killing her mother. Obviously, that doesn’t make killing or assaulting ok or justifiable, but in terms of criminal responsibility, someone in that state cannot have it. That’s the degree of mental illness with criminal responsibility specifically. It’s a defense that’s used globally, and it’s so engrained into the basic fiber of law that, at bare minimum, humanity does recognize that there are some exceptions to responsibility for one’s actions when it comes to having a mental illness. This is obviously an extreme example, but someone else mentioned the insanity defense, so it’s worth bringing up as an example again.

So, with that specifically, it really depends on the illness and the experience of said illness for the individual (just because someone who committed a crime has schizophrenia, that doesn’t mean they automatically qualify for the insanity defense - they have to meet the specifications and the example I showed above fit that).",National-Leopard6939,1cgcehu
38,"You can technically take the basic concept behind that defense and apply it to lesser situations involving psychosis. That’s why if someone I know who experiences psychosis becomes belligerent with me or does something socially unacceptable while in psychosis, I know it’s not really “them”, and they’re reacting to whatever their delusions and hallucinations are making them say/do. It’s the same logic- it’s just one involves a criminal act that the person had no ability to appreciate doing, and the other involves non-criminal acts that the person had no ability to appreciate doing. 

For other things like alcoholism secondary to trauma and anxiety, I tend to give grace for those situations, too - mainly because I know they reached such a low point where the only accessible way to numb everything was a substance. Substance use is incredibly stigmatized, and people have no idea how hard it is for people with addictions to overcome them. That being said, people should still be encouraged to overcome them, especially if the addiction is becoming a danger to themselves or others.

Basically: I give grace when needed, and set boundaries when needed. It all depends on the person.

Overall, I think modern-day conversations about personal responsibility with mental illness started off in a good direction (I.e: people who knowingly use their illnesses as a scapegoat to excuse them of everything they do without working to better themselves). However, I think there’s also been an over-correction where people are starting to think that having a mental illness never means a bad behavior can come out of it and that people are always 100% in control of their actions with their illness. That is just not true, and I’m glad discussions about the nuances around that, along with access to resources, are becoming a thing.",National-Leopard6939,1cgcehu

Not that it matters, as he is a competent scientist, but it gave me a weird vibe that his mind was already made up on the matter before he set out to write this book.  So I didn't like that.  Would have made me feel better if he went into it with a ""I have no idea"" attitude.  But anyway... I don't buy it but I absolutely don't discount it.  I WANT to.  But I haven't done my due diligence.

From my understanding, as you pointed out, we might live in a deterministic universe, where everything was set in to motion by the big bang and therefore everything is predictable and therefore nothing is random.  Or at least not random on the scale that matters to effect our choices. 

What I don't buy, again I need more knowledge, is that there IS in fact randomness or undetermined things in the universe.  Yes quantum madness.  His argument is that those phenomenon are so small they have no influence on us.  But, like, the very fabric of reality isn't certain, and we are absolutely a part of that fabric.  Everything is.  But the argument is, ""oh well those things only happen to really small particles"" ok fine. 

I think for right now, I'm not sure it's possible for us to say it's one or the other.  At least not to a point where it can become a scientific theory.  It remains a hypothesis.  It's a clever one and I need to do my own research, but for now I don't buy it from the little that I have read.",ClarenceJBoddicker,1cgcehu

Or say a more morbid example. Cannibalism is absolutely disgusting an unethical in my opinion, I would never choose to be a cannibal. But if I had been born into some undiscovered tribe in the Amazon where that was the norm I would probably be a cannibal. Is it a choice for me not to be a cannibal?

Especially considering rising mental health issues/suicides rates as well as so many social media platforms which seemingly further mental health issues. 

I also really wish social media could be regulated and/or limited somehow. Any photoshopped photos would have a mark on them indicating that they were altered. People should not be allowed to use social media after a certain time, or for longer than an hour per day etc. The benefits of social media pale in comparison to the harm it causes.

I suppose, giving some anonymity to a mental health check up could encourage some demographics to reach out more, especially men, as the element of judgement for potentially feeling low could be taken away.

I've actually thought through this point quite a bit and had thought up the possibility of a questionnaire. It could be sent out as a paper copy or as a link to your email to take online. 

Based on the answers you give, it could either place you at a 'healthy' state of mental health, or recognise that you may need some help and either provide links to services that offer advice and support or techniques to help with general anxiety etc. And if you score very highly on the questionnaire, in that you show signs of having some mental health struggles, it could recommend that you speak to your GP for solutions.

Her doctor even gave me letter for courts then to wanting her to have such done. Know what results have been last 12 days she's been out?

She said she would get into treatment program if I dropped the DVPO  so we could communicate freely. Once that dropped, she went to her probation meeting the next week, and that Officer basically said she did not have to undergo any such program, as back in Feb when she was taken in then on an IVC to Davis Hospital, there was an analysis done then, but no program continued and she walked out after 72 hrs; and this stupid probation officer in Taylorsville was satisfied with that??? SO she only needs to serve out the remainder of year going to meet Officer monthly and pay some fees???

IVC happened in February of this year. About 60 days after, an attack on me occurred coming home from work, and she was posting violent, hateful crap on Facebook all day even prior,  and assault happened on 4 officers who came to my 911 call April 15th and home damage from that mess I still have to repair. And she is out of the woods yet again with nothing being done?  I told my lawyer then and Court Advocate why did the Judge/Courts not have this done while she was incarcerated, instead of leaving it to be done when she was released?

She is a Master Manipulator and so many people here cannot believe this happened, as she buddies-buddies up to this probation officer, they talk about her puzzles and coloring and on pre-announce visit when they came to the house 2 days ago, only wanting to see where she sleeps and nothing more?

With physical health, a doctor could say ""You have high blood pressure, you need to do x, y, and z."" With mental health, it's different. No matter what questions the doctor asks, if you think you're fine, you'll mostly answer that way. ""Have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless lately?"" (Which is a question on most depression questionnaires) ""No, I'm fine."" Honestly, a lot of the more objective things are energy level, sleep quality, appetite, etc. (I'm mostly speaking about depression/anxiety) and doctors already ask about this. I think a better solution is doctors referring more patients to mental health services, even for relatively small things.

I would suggest trying to talk to a therapist about it, and a psychiatrist can help with medication. Another way to go about this would be admitting yourself to the hospital and explain what is happening. You would be able to get medicated, get diagnosis and help.

Some psych wards aren't great, however they are some good ones. I have been to good and bad ones. But I think that either way, you are still going to get help.

30,"Addiction to suffering, the pain, the sadness, the darkness of being lost in one's mind, the despair of knowing something is definitely wrong with you, but because your so mentally, emotionally and physically exhausted, burned, traumatized.

 Every opportunity, every option to act, to move on, to let go off, is a contradiction. Knowing that, you've ran simulations in your head, knowing you've contemplated every decision, actions, you've ever had, or some. 

Only to fall right back, into despair and suffering. And thus allowing time and this mental illness *alien to form You're new identity or part of it, until it's too late or you're fully absorbed by it.

This kind of mindset, feeling is found amongst us too many times, from all corners of the world, in every culture, nation, race, society, hierarchy. 

I've seen both sides of the spectrum, from the wealthy to the poor, the successful, to the unsuccessful, we're all plagued by our mortal hearts and minds. 

By some people go unknowingly their whole lives and become husks, of their former self. 

They've lost all, if not most of their humanity, since they been so soul crushed by their experience in existence, that they become machine like only to focus on the primary function of survival. 

Generally in most cases, on the spectrum of a undiagnosed sever mental health illness, most commonly between psychopathic and sociopathic spectrums. 

Think of Patrick Bateman and The Joker. 

Hence the random murder cases, attacks, incidents, from the least likely suspects or figures to the most notorious ones that are evident of it. 

The journey to recovery, relationships, friendships are long and tiresome as it's often viewed as a game, a manipulation tactic. 

Very few people will admit to that, let alone acknowledge it, even less will seek intervention to combat it.

There is hope for salvation, through melodic music, physical fitness, eating healthier, animal care, more sunlight exposure, clean air flow in one's unit of living, seeking perhaps a faith based community, or simply exploring one's hobby, working lots or hours and keeping yourself busy. 

Learning to descale one's expectations, remodeling yourself and what you desire most, goals, wants versus needs, sex, drive, ambitions etc. 

Due to stress and trauma, especially if you've grew in a dysfunctional family home, it's a challenging journey, but not an impossible one. 

Learning to let go, to forgive oneself, to breathe, to eat, sleep, is a total reprogramming of ourselves. 

But such is the way of things and so long as we attempt to acknowledge that we were used, abused, manipulated, assaulted by them, we can start to self reflect, that we're victims of abusive parents, friends, lovers,

55,"I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you meant well but this is not a helpful comment unfortunately. 

Not only does it demonstrate a lack of understanding of mental health (or ANY health issues for that matter) and how it can interfere with building routines, it also ignores the part where OP goes about their day anyway, which is something a lot of mentally ill people do for as long as they're able to until they burn out and crash. Feeling tired all the time is also a well-known symptom of many health conditions. Tiredness is not laziness. Most things actually aren't laziness. 

Telling mentally ill people (who make up the majority of people on this sub, plus formerly mentally ill people and loved ones of mentally ill people) that they could just be lazy can contribute to their already negative self-image and make their mental illness worse, and thus it gets even harder to do things. No, your comment alone won't make or break their mental health but A LOT of people share that kind of rhetoric and it wears people down so your comment is still a contribution to that. You're potentially contributing to that perceived ""laziness"" when you say this to people, not helping. If your intention is to help I'd rethink that attitude and ask mentally ill people about their experiences to develop some empathy. Please try it.

That said, routines aren't bad. Not the solution for everything and everyone, but not bad.

67,"It's possible.  

Mostly, I've developed the knack of avoiding potentially emotional circumstances. If something makes me feel anything  I avoid it. 'Positive' or 'negative', I am not getting involved. 

I try. I go to therapy. I try to be aware of other people's emotional states. I hope that 'acting as though' will inspire me to embrace my emotional state. Instead I go into a panic attack or dissociate if I can't remove myself when an emotion bubbles up close to my tolerance threshold. 

And it sounds like it's a conscious decision, but it's not as though I want to be an unfeeling lump. I know some things are meant to illicit an emotional state, and other people are feeling those things, and I want to participate in that emotional bonding. Instead my inability to be genuine makes things awkward, and that reinforces my reaction. 

Psychiatrists, & therapists, & I have been deconstructing me for my entire life. We've finally gotten my depression under control, so I've been feeling better. It's almost like being 'happy' is within my grasp. But when I feel happy, I get an overwhelming urge to stop my medication. I start feeling anxious, then panicky.

Just sitting alone in my room feeling like everything is good will send me into a fight-or-flight panic. 

At the heart of it *is* fear and anxiety. Fear of rejection and abandonment. Fear of social repercussions. Fear of losing control. Fear of being found vulnerable or weak. 

But as long as I don't actually have emotional reactions to anything, or I can mimic the emotional actions of people I'm with, the fear is kept at bay.

I also think I always had some kind of hope I could become better, if only I could hold on a bit longer, because I always felt that there were stuff I wanted to do and experiences I wanted to have before leaving for good. But then again, I never had real chronic depression, I had severe anxiety, panic attacks, and C-PTSD. And hey, it did get better, after being able to break free from the abusive people in my family, move out, get in contact with an amazing psychologist and a relentless psychiatrist who both worked so hard with me in therapy and finding the right cocktail of meds to fix the imbalance in my brain chemistry. It took years, but I am in such a better place now than just a couple of years ago.

The two worst ones were where i text my best friend that i wasnt sure i was gonna make the night and i might go to hospital. The other one was over the course of a few days which got bad enough where i started making a mental list of people to say goodbye to. Thank god it lifted after a few days though. That was pretty scary because i started feeling happy knowing it was all gonna be done soon and that all my worries were irrelevant.

Got THIS close to jump in front of a train one evening and THIS close to crash my car another night. What stopped me was the thought of my mom crying over my dead body. I wouldn't do that to her, never.

My new job was driving me crazy - it was very alienating and I couldn't give a damn about it - things with my gf were going down and I felt like I had no purpose at all. I saw all my firends getting corporate jobs before me while I struggled even to make interviews, even though I graduated top of my class. I compared my life with theirs and thought I was shit at life, even though I had a caring family and girlfriend who had my back and kept telling me I was worth something. I couldn't see that worth. Then, with therapy I started to see something. And then, after my gf left me I left that fucking job and regained self awareness. I really see something in me now. Let's call it a spark. And, most of all, I see that my journey does not have to be the same as others' because we are all different. 

I'm struggling with the breakup - I have passive suicidal ideations too, like wanting to die when asleep or hoping I get some kind of illness which kills me instantly - but I would not do it willingly. I see something and I hope I can see some other in the future. The pain is eating me from the insides out though, especially because I got a big tendency to self-guilt.

It would give me a moment of feeling okay followed by crashing back into the dark times. At one point I decided to just lean into the dark stuff I have liked since I was an angsty depressed teen in the 90's and threw on a bunch of dark/harsh/splatter industrial and 90's aggrotech. Somehow noisy electronic songs with a distorted voice yell-singing about dark stuff and songs about the worst of humanity was... what I needed. I suppose it's partly comfort as it was my music taste in my late teens/early 20's, and also listening to such subject matter puts my own life situations into perspective. If I'm just depressed I'll either go for really sad goth shit, or like upbeat ska and punk or synthpop as a counterbalance. It really depends on the time of year.

Is it true that there is some romanticizing happening today of mental disorders? Yes. Is it a massive problem? I’m not so sure.

I’m more inclined to believe that people are self-misdiagnosing themselves a lot of the time, but I do believe they are unhappy and are looking for comfort. 

Keep in mind that we live in hard times financially and that (in the USA) proper healthcare is hard to get. This is the perfect time for mental health problems to be perpetuated. The worst part about a lot of mental health disorders is that they often feed into themselves.

Example: a poor person will be stressed due to their finances, this situation will cause a mental breakdown that causes them to lose their job or close friends/relatives and then their financial situation may get worse or their stress relief system flees.",babyfacedjanitor,1c8i9jy

9,There is nothing romantic about mental illness. People often think mental illness is well understood. Until a break down happens. Until the symptoms show. Or until it becomes difficult for another person in any manner. THEN you are shamed.

10,I TOTALLY agree ! And there is even another topic: when who suffer from mental illness (or it is someone who has been said to because doctors nowadays prescribe everything to everyone) that seems to encourage taking pills. In reality having mental illness is rare and people who has them in this time it is because they are so used to take pills that don’t manage to live without them.,Fede351_,1c8i9jy
11,"Yes! This has been on my mind for months now. I think it is becoming an issue, but I think it also helps some people-not a clear cut issue. It is concerning to me though the amount of self-diagnosis people are doing based off watching video after video of people displaying, performing or listing symptoms. I think self-diagnosis can sometimes be helpful, but we also have to consider the very real phenomena of confirmation bias. 

I am really torn about people using the quirkier sides of mental illness and/or neurodivergence to build a social media platform around. I think often it's a genuine expression and might just be a more feasible means of income for someone who is not comfortable working a regular job, and also maybe is healing for them and their followers. It can also though become really problematic, especially when the support and endearing aspect of this doesn't extend to people who aren't conventionally attractive.

  
I am neurodivergent and grew up with a brother with autism. I get very frustrated when I see people build their social media identity around being autistic because they don't like loud noises or have a particular preference for something. My brother has struggled immensely in every area of his life because he has never been really accepted for who he is. But he's not white, he's trans and he's autistic in the truest sense of the word. 

  
I know autism looks different for many people, but with the risk of sounding insensitive, I'm going to be honest and say I think a lot of people are looking for answers to their struggles in earnest and possibly picking what seems to be the best option with the information that social media is providing them. I will never personally attack or challenge someone's self diagnosis, but we need to consider that the power of suggestion is strong and so is confirmation bias.  

  
Okay my final problematic take is that, the majority of people on social media building their platforms around mental health and/or some sort of diagnosis, are young white women. Our world's power dynamic has shifted and I think sometimes white women need a way to feel unique or special, and this offers that feeling.

Remember one thing everyone has there own issues and when people are closed minded theyu themselves have trauma except they do not want to face it because its easier not to. How ever in your position your actually facing it and trying to figure it out. That is a very powerful move because like i said people refuse to do this. its to hard to be deppressed and fix trauma.

2,"Back in 2017 my wife had a mental health crisis. It was the end of a shift at the hospital, she started driving home and started having suicidal thoughts like wanting to drive off the road. She turned around and went back to the hospital. They sent her that night to a mental hospital. 

At the time I had a 11 month old and a 4 year old at home and I didn’t understand why she had to go away. She had been “fine” the day before (though in hindsight it was mania as she was wanting to eat anything and do things she normally wouldn’t want to). I was so angry at the time I didn’t want to talk to her the next morning when she called. Her sisters didn’t understand either at the time why she had checked herself in to a mental hospital. 

I knew she had had struggled with mental health most of her adult life. I knew she was (at the time) on one med for depression. 

Come to find out it was bi-polar depression she actually had. Ended up on 3-4 meds to help balance her out. During this experience I educated myself on her condition and came to realize it wasn’t her fault. Her sisters came to realize that too. 

Fast forward 7 years and she’s in a mental hospital again for a steroid-induced (same as 2017) manic episode that got so severe we couldn’t manage at home. 

So my point is I was the family that didn’t understand mental health, but I grew and I changed as the different experiences happened.

But you need to consider what that means as well. You’re right, medical bills and debt are a factor. You will be forced onto psych based medicine (part of what you consent to when you sign up for it)
You don’t know how long you’ll be there. Average for a lot of folks is 3-7 days, but you’re under the “care” of the psychiatrist that is assigned to your case. You’re not coming out until they think you’re no longer a danger to yourself or society.

5,"Assuming here you're in the US:

It is so much better, you get treated better and have more rights when you admit yourself versus being admitted ""against your will"". So unless you're about to do something you'll probably regret, check yourself in as a voluntary patient instead of an involuntary patient. Telling your doctor or therapist that you are going to...yourself will likely get you committed as an involuntary patient, that should only be reserved for emergencies. It's a legal thing. As involuntary, you are not allowed to direct your care or check yourself out without a judge giving you the okay. It's similar to being arrested (unfortunately no joke). 

Anyway, there are a few options to get a stay in the mental hospital:

If you have health insurance, call who covers your mental healthcare, sometimes under ""behavioral health"". Ask what providers are in your network. If you're not currently seeing a psychiatrist, you're going to need one. Say that it is urgent and if you can possibly get a sooner appointment. A psychiatrist can then arrange an inpatient stay when you go to your appointment. If you already have a psychiatrist, you can ask for an urgent appointment, and again, they will probably recommend a place and send a prior authorization for you to go there. Insurance usually wants authorization first, because inpatient stays are expensive. The doctor has to fill out a form saying an inpatient stay is necessary. But it's similar to getting a hospital stay for anything else, like getting your appendix out. You then check into the psychiatric hospital that they referred you to.

If you're uninsured/or underinsured, look up what your county hospital/hospital district is. This is the public hospital that gets funding from grants and tax money. Sometimes you can even find the psychiatric hospital/unit that they run. Sometimes called psychiatric emergency services (like an ER but for mental health). You can either show up there and ask to be admitted, or if you can't find what their psychiatric unit is, just go to their regular emergency room. You will get evaluated by a psychiatrist on call and really stress that you need an inpatient stay because you, ""fear for your health and safety"" or something along those lines. Since you showed up there yourself, you will likely be admitted under voluntary status.

(These hospitals won't cost as much but they're also not very nice places in general). I got my bills written off in 7 years with only some dings to my credit score. They pretty much assume people going there can't pay their bills. 

Then there's option three. The nuclear option. Involuntary status. Call 911 or any suicide hotline and tell them you're ready to do it and you have a plan. Police and an ambulance will come to your house. The paramedics will do a quick check of you, and transport you to the nearest emergency room (no, you don't get to pick under this scenario). Maybe you will go in the back of the police car in handcuffs. It depends on how polite you are, and how the first responders feel that day. Ambulance rides are nicer but way more expensive. The cop car is free, but you're going to be handcuffed. Then they'll admit you to the psychiatric department through the emergency room. They're not allowed to experiment on humans, but they are allowed to give you whatever treatment they want as an involuntary patient, unless you're allergic to it. That means if you have depression but they want to say you're psychotic, they can give you anti-psychotics. If you decline treatment, they will say you're non-compliant and being ""combative"", even if you're totally polite about it. It's their word against yours, and as one intelligent nurse said to me, ""who's going to believe you? You are the patient"". Thus, you are the crazy one. This is how most people end up in the psychiatric hospital, so you're not alone picking this option. But bless your heart, it's a miserable ride. 

I've done all of these myself, and I would highly recommend the first two over the last option. But the last option is a guaranteed way to get that ""psychiatric holiday"", maybe a court mandated 90 days of it. No, they don't care if you have rent, a job, or pets to feed. They're locking your ass up with the last option, but it is keeping you safe when you are a harm to yourself. Hopefully you have a responsible person who will feed your cat and keep you from getting evicted if you pick option 3. I would totally go voluntarily. You can still stay and get help, get stabilized, get caught up on sleep, separate yourself from your toxic environment, whatever you need. A voluntary stay can also turn into an involuntary one if you say certain things (I think you know what they are- directly threatening harm to yourself or others). If you have insurance, I would start by calling the behavioral health line. It's usually answered by a real human 24/7.

12,"Most of things that you mentioned are false. 1) consenting to being hospitalized does not automatically consent to being medicated. You can be medicated involuntarily on an emergent situation or if petitioned and granted by a judge.  2)hospitalization stays vary on a case by case basis. Laws differ from state to state, but each state has its own variation of a specified timeline for voluntary hospitalizations where you must be released unless your case is going to be taken to court and the judge will extend your stay. Here in Illinois, it’s 5 days. 3) you can still join the military. You will need your recruiter to file a waiver on your behalf. More than likely the waiver will be approved. You can also have a government job as well as be a LEO with a psych history; however, there are certain barring diagnosis such as schizophrenia for obvious reasons. 4) Federally, you can buy and own firearms granted that you were not involuntarily hospitalized or adjudicated as mentally defective by a court (this is straight from the 4473 form). State laws are different and may prohibit ownership or conceal carry for a certain period. Illinois requires a firearm owners identification card (FOID) to own firearms and its also needed for conceal carry. The FOID card gets revoked with any kind of psychiatric hospitalization and there is a ownership prohibition period of 5 years from the last hospitalization. This is different in states that do not require any kind of licensure for firearm ownership. 5) it is highly illegal to deny housing or evict someone based disability including mental illness. Any fresh out of law school attorney would win the case if it ever even went to court.

17,"Don’t listen to that guy. Most of that information is anecdotal and false. If you are not doing so well that you are considering to be hospitalized then you should definitely seek treatment. You may not need to get hospitalized and can seek treatment on an outpatient basis. 

Just so you know, there is a significant difference between voluntary and involuntary hospitalization. I’ve seen commercial pilots, train conductors, police officers, and active duty military personnel who were hospitalized and continue to be employed in their respective fields. Only certain jobs require that you disclose any mental illness or a hospitalization. Otherwise, this is information is protected federally by HIPAA (assuming that you are in the US). You can request for a doctor’s note for when you miss work that mentions that you were hospitalized but does not disclose the type of hospitalization or the reason . If your employer does find out, there may be restrictions placed on your duties. These restrictions are usually temporary. Yes, mental health stigma does exist, but you’d surprised how accommodating and understanding some employers could be. It may be extremely difficult to get better on your own and you are on here for a reason.

18,"Uhm. Unless your career specifically ask about mental health (medical, military, pilots, etc)….. and as long as you’re voluntary (you should get notice if you’re involuntary)…. Then you’ll still be able to get a gun, etc…..

If you are involuntary (a lot of psych wards are requiring this), it is more likely to happen if police pick you up or you go to the ER…. But once you there, just ask the psychiatrist if you can become voluntary….. they can switch it over up until you get on a court order or possibly discharged first….keep asking daily… in my case over 30 hospitalizations, simply asking to be switched to voluntary works 50-80% of the time. 

Involuntary court orders are put in the Law Enforcement Information Network…. My state police will send a letter explaining that you’re not allowed to purchase fire arms. 

Another option is go to what’s called a freestanding psychiatric hospital not connected to another hospital system…. They typically do their own evaluations and let you be voluntary…. 

If you’re not a danger to yourself or others, look for an outpatient mental health professional…. Or ask your primary care for a referral.

13,"Reddit is not the best place to ask for help if you have validation issues. I feel it's impossible to differentiate from trolls and people honestly trying to help.

There is just so much information and nuance that can be passed on and, if there are any mental health professionals answering, they would not go into a diagnosis or treatment suggestions. It would be ethically wrong and morally irresponsible to guide you into anything without a proper evaluation.

So, keep in mind that whatever answer or reaction you get (including mine) for mental health questions has very little to do with you. Your typed words are sounded in our own voices in our heads, and our evaluation and response is what we have lived, experienced, thought and tried. Ultimately the way people reply to you is more of a reflection on how we treat ourselves and what we believe we deserve and need.

Knowledge is power. The more vocabulary you build to relate things to your professional care, the better they will be able to guide you. They'll have more information and you will have a better comprehension of the ""map"" they give you on your way to recovery.

And -yes- there are people who try to get a diagnosis for many reasons. Here's a first hand experience I've had: I have a psychiatric service dog and I needed some documentation for her. The therapist's secretary made negative comments about what is or isn't a service dog, going so far as print several pages off the internet to back up her thoughts. I thought it was strange that she seemed to have an issue with me and my service dog and, later, found out that another \[first-time\] client had recently come in asking for similar documentation to be able to fly with her/his dog and, when he/she did not get it, argued and insulted them, and refused to pay the bill! TL;DR: Next time someone brings that argument, acknowledge that people do cheat and that any professional would be able to identify BS.

Outside of the realm of psychiatry and physical imbalances that require medication management, mental health is a lot about identifying negative thought patterns and practicing healthy ones. Practice validating these nay-sayers (or accept that you cannot know what they mean to do) and use that practice to validate yourself. I'm willing to bet (remember that I am talking to the ""you"" in my head) that your inner voice is the one that criticizes you the most, most often. It's easier to be nicer to others than to ourselves. Practice and strengthen your compassion towards others and, like a muscle, it will eventually be strong enough to work on you.",GoodMoGo,1030dne

So you can most definitely have mental health problems at your age. Relying on alcohol probably isn’t the best coping mechanism as your brain is still forming - the brain is still forming I believe until your early 20s but I understand we turn to other ways to cope when we are having a hard time.

9,"When I was younger I had selective mutism which is a complex CHILDHOOD anxiety disorder that affects your ability to speak in certain social settings. Not only can children experience mental health issues, there are several disorders that affect mainly children. I honestly did not know there was a name for what I had til I was older so there are without a doubt many older adults who aren’t as educated about mental health today and tend to brush it off. One of the worst things you could possibly say to someone experiencing such an episode is “it’s all in your head.” I grew out of selective mutism when I was 7 but the social anxiety and phobia that is linked to it doesn’t just disappear. To tell you the truth, my mental health was at its worst when I was around 15-16. I’m now 20 and I still have social anxiety but I can tell you that I’m getting better as I continue to learn about myself, what I had, why I reacted the way I did. I also gave myself a break as you should too. Stay educated in mental health and whatever you suspect you might have it doesn’t hurt to get tested for it. You may need medication because a lot of disorder are caused by genetics or complications with your brain’s chemicals and you literally can’t control it.",heavenlyhell30,iaoz80

13,"25 years ago, I was about your age, a little younger even, and was smoking about 1 pack a day, paid for the habit by selling drugs, and drank nearly every night.

I lost a really good uncle when I was younger, I was a victim of bullying most of my childhood, and had parents who loves me but didn't understand.

I tried to kill myself when I was 17 and after someone found me and brought me to the hospital, the doctor told me I was too young to be depressed and to get over it.

They didn't even call my parents, which meant I had to hide my neck for almost 2 months while the bruising went away.

I took the time to ask my mom for help, but they couldn't afford therapy or psychological help, so she found me a local priest who also happened to have his degree in psychology.

After a 3 hour conversation, without a single mention of being saved, or God/Jesus, he helped me understand that what I was feeling wasn't normal, but that it was up to me to ask for help, and to try my best every day for those who do love me, because if I left the world, I'd be missing all that is good in it.

I quit drinking alcohol, and slowly quit smoking cigarettes.  I kept up cannabis, as it helped with my anxiety, but I still had severe depression which it doesn't help with.  I've gone through a lot, am now in my 40s and married with two children of my own.

My oldest has never been bullied, and will have two parents who know how she feels and always listen to what they have to say, no matter how they feel.

There are good and bad moments all through life, and let me tell you that with the right mindset, the right mental tools, life is amazing and it can be without drugs and alcohol.

You need help, and you reached out here; as you can tell, people like us exist and thrive.  You just need to ask and others will always be ready to help.

Don't go at it alone, and make sure you talk openly with people you trust and those you know can find you help.

Take care OP",machstem,iaoz80
14,"Young people can certain have mental problems and the most serious ones tend to start in the teens. Pretty much anyone with intelligence can have a variety of psychological problems and in my experience, the smarter you are the tougher life is. However, smart people also recover better from mental problems because they can apply their intelligence to solving problems better than others. 

Anyway, I have met a huge number of suicidal people, who actually killed themselves, have tried, think about it, talk about it, etc. All of that needs to be taken seriously because I have met people who I was talking to, who said a bunch of positive stuff, then killed themselves 15 minutes later. 

I work in psych, by the way, that's who I know all this stuff. 

Anyway, I would MUCH rather meet someone who ONLY TALKS about suicide, than actually wants to do it. I will talk to them ALL DAY with a smile on my face. Actually killing yourself is horrible and it's a very bad feeling to meet someone who commits suicide. 

However, what I tell people is that if a person is saying they want to kill themselves for ATTENTION why do they want that kind of attention? 

I enjoy loved ones paying attention to me. But, I want it to be for good things. I am funny, so I want people to laugh. I am smart, so I want them to be interested. I am a good artist. I am very smart and athletic, so I want them to be impressed. I am very generous and giving and not a selfish person, so I want some praise. I want positive attention!! 

I do not want people to see me as sick, crazy, heartbreaking, and so forth. So, people who talk about killing themselves, or hurt themselves, to get positive attention DO NOT KNOW HOW TO GET ATTENTION and so they need help. 

What most such people want is for people to care what happens to them. But they end up communicating that in a scary way that turns people off, which just makes people not care to pay attention more. So, they need to develop new ways to communicate what they need. 

Also, some people are unlucky and they're a smart and sensitive person born into a family of stupid people. These stupid people will never been your equals and never talk to you as you like and need. So, that's when you need to find a positive peer group that you can talk to. 

Sometimes that's through therapy, making new friends, meetup groups, and stuff like that, if they have them near you.",TheAdlerian,iaoz80

It has still affected me to this day to have not been in therapy the whole time. 

My best advice for you is to not use alcohol, I know you dont want to, but alcohol is a depressant and doesn't make you feel any better in the long run, especially at your age. Talk to your friends and family that you can trust. Some people are more receptive than others to listening to these things, find those people, talk to them, and be there for them as well. Talk to your school counselor. They're there for you. Talk to your doctor/parents/counselor (whoever will listen) about talking to a licensed therapist. The best kind of relief is venting about life to someone who has no connection to it and wont share your secrets (unless you're being suicidal, they'll call your parents and set a baker act for you where you'd be hospitalized). A therapist will sometimes help by giving you suggestions too, to help with whatever you're dealing with.

It can also let that hidden mental health issue come out. It could be something temporary, or something that you'll live the rest of your life with. Even if it's not real and just in your head, that would still be a problem that you could get help for. Being unchecked could make it worse.

Please try to get help from anyone who will listen. Depending on where you are from, it may be common practice to not diagnose you until you’re 18, because hormones can and will also have an impact on your mental health. (It does get a bit easier once puberty hormones have calmed down).

I understand its hard for some families to take their children having mental issues seriously. Its issues that no one can see most of the time except yourself. I moved home at that time. My dad thought I was making up and acting out the the ways I was at first. It wasn't until it got so bad I was having this little seizure freak out episodes where I would just curl into a ball and hit myself in the head over and over that he was finally like oh okay maybe something is definitely wrong.

Im sorry your family has to be like that too. Don't wait on them though to understand what you are going through. The best you can do is explain whats going on with you as best you can. And then there is resources to get your own help. There's a lot of people that will help you especially at your age. Maybe once your family and stuff see you suddenly getting help from these external forces they will realize something is wrong.

You are too young to be going through this and you need to get help as soon as you can. You should be enjoying your teenage years not fighting mental illness.

First, yes kids can have mental health issues for a variety of reasons such as history of abuse, family neglect, and so on. Second, I feel that some mental health issues manifest themselves at puberty. I'm not saying that's true for everyone, but it certainly was true for me. My first episode that got my parents attention to be aware that I even had mental health issues was when I was 15 or 16 when I put a knife to my chest in front of the family during a heated argument. As I've learned over the years, I have a family history of what I now know is a common trifecta of mental health issues in depression, anxiety, and ADHD. This seems to be hereditary, and almost always manifests itself at puberty in everyone. Until very recently, I was always guarded to the idea of having kids, and subjecting another generation of the bloodline to that same problem as a result.

I was your age once now 26, I still have some issue but slowly getting better. Don't let these demons take over you and try to live your life healthy, but still fun. Don't let things get to you don't care what people say or do to you. Stay away from that toxicity and just live and find what makes you happy. Obviously though you're 15, this is still a lot to take in but I really recommend you use this internet now to learn something now. I'd do anything to have the mind I have now as a teen.

Your feelings matter so much, okay? You deserve attention, validation and affection. What you're going through is real. Depression and anxiety overwhelm people far older than you -- of course you're overwhelmed. Your brain isn't equipped to handle this.

Is there a trustworthy adult in your life -- maybe at school -- that you can talk to? Or is there any way you can schedule a doctor's appointment? 

My parents refused treatment for me as a minor, but when I turned 18 I made an appointment and unloaded everything onto a nurse. She signed me up for teletherapy on the spot.

72,"anyone with a mind can have issues regarding mental health, relying on substances is something I understand but the only thing I can say is try to face things head on rather than escape.  speaking from experience relying on any substance is a slippery slope and can get you into some bad situations.  I'm only 21 so its not like I have a load of life experience but when I meet with people from my high school and tell them my story they are always shocked by how much I have bee through so ultimately I think what you are experiencing is unfortunate but normal.

In addition to my mental health issues, I also dealt with having alcoholic family members as well which took on a toll on me. Fortunately, I was able to get through growing up in those types of circumstances and it did not end up having too much of a long term impact on me.

I, myself, struggle with mental health issues and have needed counselling and therapy throughout my life. To find that things have gone so far downhill for those seeking immediate care is alarming, to say the least. Im angry my child had to go through all of this and was made to feel like a burden(he kept apologizing and i had to keep reminding him it was okay and i was proud of him.). Im angry that he wanted to give up because it felt hopeless at several points. Im angry that a lot of people arent getting the help they need and its no wonder the world is in such a bad spot when we cant even get the help to those who really want and need it. We have a populace of people hurting and struggling Its scary.",ThoughtfullyYours,q4yx4r
8,"Yep. Very frustrating. I have Kaiser which is not accepted at any facilities besides Kaiser facilities. I was told if I want to see a therapist weekly I must be considered a high risk patient. Well this past year I for sure turned high risk by almost killing myself…and you know what they told me? I was too vulnerable to be assigned to a therapist outside of Kaiser, and because their mental health facilities are so impacted that means I can only speak with my therapist OVER THE PHONE once every one to two months.

It’s very discouraging and to me not even worth going because it’s so hard to build a relationship with a therapist under these circumstances.

So, I was brought to a hospital to get evaluated which took about 8 hours of me just sleeping, watching TV with no sound on and hearing my nurse talk shit about me being there again and wasting her time. Then the doctor just discharged me which was fine. I took both of my buspirone at once with nightquil and went to bed for a while.  Yeah the American health care system sucks , but I am in outpatient PHP and it's ok so far since I don't have to pay with my insurance, just for IOP which is 50 per vist for 3 weeks .

13,"Sounds like my experience with trying to get mental help in Southern California. I really dont know how to help or what advice to give because this is the way most mental health services end up happening in the US. After you go through the process of evaluation, they may hold him for a day or 2, talk to him a bit, and then probably just send him home with some meds. From there, they will probably schedule once a month meetings with a county mental health office, assuming you have one in your area. Beyond that, there really isnt much in the way of widely accessible mental health treatment in the US. And, not gona lie, my experience in the hospital led me to believe that the hospital, nor any other hospital in the area, had the resources to get me the treatment I needed and I would have to figure it out myself.",micktalian,q4yx4r
14,I've waited in the hospital's Emergency Mental Health ward for days because there were no beds available anywhere in the State. This hospital ships patients to all over the State for treatment and there were no open beds anywhere. They've sent me home before because they couldn't tell me when they would be getting me a bed and I was stuck in limbo in EMH eating cold turkey sandwiches three times a day and sleeping on a chair that converts to a really uncomfortable bed for days. I have Medicare so they can literally send me anywhere in the State but sometimes there just isn't any open beds.,incandesantlite,q4yx4r

I get to the hospital this morning and the place thats supposed to take him calls me and says they need two tons of documents im not even sure i have before he can go and they tell me 40 mons before hes supposed to be there. Is this a damn game to them? How are they helping anyone? Its sunday and i cant even get replacement documents for them today. Wow. Just wow.,ThoughtfullyYours,q4yx4r
16,Honestly I’m glad I am from Canada because I never dealt with this before. I never heard of the struggles of  receiving health care in America besides it being expensive and I’m so sorry that you guys had to go through that. I wish you the best and hope you find good care soon,prabbits,q4yx4r
17,"I feel this. It took me forever to find a place that took my insurance. I finally did and now I'm on a REALLY long wait-list, I told them I needed help soon and all they told me was if I felt like hurting myself to go to the ER. I explained that I could feel a depressive episode coming on, but they couldn't do anything about it.",Awkward_Apricot312,q4yx4r
18,"As for many European countries (e.g. Italy and Spain), the mental health system here is quite horrific as well.

The only pro, which is shadowed by the cons, is that in most of the countries you can get free therapy and free psychiatric check-outs. 

The problem is that you need to wait a loooot. Sometimes even two months. 

Not everyone has access to this though, depending on the wealth of the zone.

Moreover, it is much more beneficial for therapists and psychiatrists to work privately.  So, basically, the outcome is that the free therapy and free check-out are usually taken by not-that-good professionals.

In a nutshell, if you want a decent and fast support, you need to spend a lot of money",roythaqueen,q4yx4r
19,This is why people don’t want to ask for help lol I’ve been to the ER once for 15 minutes to get a tick removed in my belly button (didn’t know what it was at 1st and was too late for urgent care) they tried charging 2grand while I was dual insured…like ok next time I’ll just die cause if that’s a minor issue I don’t want to deal with the debt and stress of a big one. I choose death lol,,q4yx4r
20,"Here is a helpful hint. There is something called EMTALA laws that require individual who are experiencing a mental health or medical crisis to be admitted through the EMERGENCY department to any hospital that receives funding from the government (ie medicaid or Medicare) payors which is 99% of all hospitals. 

Urgent care clinics or urgent care mental clinics are not appropriate for individuals experiencing suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation  (which I am assuming your child is having). It’s the same way, that an urgent care clinic will not take care of you if you’re having a heart attack. They will call 911 and send you to an emergency department. 

In the future, walk-in to the Inpatient psychiatric hospital of your choice and present from an assessment. The will do a rapid covid test in the waiting room for you. I know it’s inconvenient for the hospital to wait to send you to a psych hospital but they have to keep all the patients safe in the psych hospital too. It’s very hard to social distance in a behavioral health facility. If you go straight to the behavioral health hospital and bypass the ED you will literally save hours and sometimes days. 

Again next time, if ever there is a psychiatric concern, go directly to a psychiatric hospital and present for an assessment, it will save you hours of time. Inpatient psychiatric hospitals are Bound by EMTALA laws and have to accept you in you are in crisis (suicidal, homicidal, psychotic).",Murse817,q4yx4r
21,"It's absolutely horrifying to think this is the system that's supposed to take care of us. I went to the ER once for panic attacks, I *was* a danger to myself and others and the wait was still 4+ hours to even talk to a nurse. Then another hour for the doctor to show up! 

In the end I only needed an IV and some anxiety/nausea stuff. But like?? At that point I had bloody knuckles from banging my hands on the ground in the parking lot and my shirt was soaked because I was running my hands through rain puddles to try to stay calm.

27,"Op, my husband has been waiting 8 months to see a pshyciatrist, he has past attempts that led to ice stays and impatient treatment that did nothing. 12 years of this bs and he isnt really any better than he was the day he talked to his dr about his depression... he spent almost 5 months in bed wanting to end it, and didnt because of me and our kids. He finally went to my internal medicine specialist who gave him an antidepressant change which is better than before but barely. Mdd sucks ass and Healthcare in the US is trash and the worst part is the stigma when other people shame you. People legit were shaming my husband to my face bc I told them about his depression legit friends, they were so nasty and I was slike no dude you dont get it, he is depressed... I had to straight up give horrible details about things he said and attempted until a mutual friend was like, oh well ot sounds like he is depressed why isn't he getting help? And SHE works in Healthcare... facepalm...  at least you have the insurance many people with mental health issues cant handle full time work and if their state is shitty like mine, you can't get insurance because of loopholes in Obama care and mediciad so people making more than 1000 a month for a family of 5 but less than 3000 a month dont qualify for anything and no one has info on any further help. I delt with that during ppd I finally just admitted myself to the er and just lied about how I had a plan so they would legally have to admit me so I could see someone, I spent hours waiting too, but it was worth it to see a doctor... and this was pre covid... its unreal how fucked up it is here. And the worst part is the first thing anyone wants to cut is mental health and schools. Like the 2 things that help keep people OUT of prison. Imo I think its all a plan to keep the prisons full bc they make so much money off of the families of the prisoners, most people in prison are in there for stupid shit or because they have mental health issues and selt medicated with stuff because seeing a doctor in the country is a privilege not a right.",princessofninja,q4yx4r

38,"I had a rough start in life that hasn’t gotten much better.  Living with Mom in my 50s, grateful she rescued me, but her ignorance about my issues left me with more issues.

The only thing that kept me alive was taking full responsibility for my own health early on.  I had to study nutrition, hygiene, psychology, philosophy, , religion, art, engineering, and a wide variety of social and communication skills as someone everyone treated as a “retard” (hostility intended) most of my life.  Looking healthy has only made it worse.

Doctors are a necessity, but if you rely on them for mental health or internal medicine, outside of surgical procedures, they will almost always let you down. I’ve learned that they can occasionally point me in the right-ish direction but then I have to ignore most of their advice and treatments (especially the useless, toxic meds), and come up with totally independent approaches requiring a lot more research and consultation, when available.

I also failed many times. I spent six figures over four decades on supplements to correct problems I didn’t understand.  It took me half a century to understand my blood sugar issues, and I only started to make progress a year ago.  So many doctors never even bothered to look.  

One doctor studied and treated me for three years after misdiagnosing my Lyme disease.  Everything he did made me worse.  And that was just one issue out of dozens on the same degree of severity.  Every breath is a miracle, I never thought I’d see thirty.

I share everyone’s frustration, but I can’t help but point this out: we have to learn to heal ourselves and each other and stop being so damn sheeplike and secretive about our suffering.  We are surrounded by predators who will take advantage of us, but we have to either live on our feet or die on our knees.

Compassion is hard, but it’s free, aside from the time invested.  What would you rather be remembered for, trying and failing, or just giving up?  Only one of those choices will potentially have you remembered well, if at all.",Xmanticoreddit,q4yx4r

94,"You know, I'm just going to say that I think you need to... I don't know, consider that maybe your experience (and experiences of friends and family) with Tricare isn't the only experience to be had. Both of my grandfather's were Navy Chaplains, my paternal grandfather retired and then worked at the marine academy as a chaplain, my father is a retired Air Force recruiter who specifically recruited medical personnel - he recently retired after 29 years, my cousin is a field med in the Army, and my ex-husband was in the air force as... I forget what it's called, but he was one of the guys who loaded bombs on planes. To further explain my experience with Tricare: my mother was born with Spina bifida. She is the oldest living person with her specific kind of Spina bifida. She has had Tricare literally her whole life because she has been a military dependent since birth. Hell, I was on Tricare from birth until my divorce a few years ago. 

All that to say, I'm well versed in the American military/government medical system. It is absolutely not perfect. Sometimes it can be hard to get an appointment. Not to mention, my medical records are strewn across 14 states and several doctors within those states since it's the military and people regularly move or deploy. My dad's been struggling with the VA since he retired. It's hard to get an appointment, it's a long drive to the VA hospital, and sometimes they don't get good answers. But now I'm no longer a dependent and the health care system out here is *way* worse. Copays are too expensive, I often have to choose between paying for meds and a doctor's appointment or something else important because it costs so fucking much, every fucking medication change I get has to be approved by insurance and it's often disapproved because the cost of the medication is more than they care to pay, trying to find urgent care and good doctors and second opinions in network... Waiting months for appointments to see someone that may not even be worth seeing... And then paying out of pocket for a useless appointment? No. It's hell. I hate it here. I hate it so much that I tried to become an officer but they wouldn't take me because I had GONE TO THERAPY. Literally the exact reason meps gave me - even though I had a letter from my therapist giving me full clearance to join. 

What I'm saying is that there isn't a single perfect system. And just because some people had a bad experience with Tricare doesn't mean everyone does. Tricare is the reason my mom is alive. You think a civilian insurance company would have paid for the tens of surgeries she has had? They wouldn't have. I can't even get one to pay for Adderall because it ""costs too much"". But... Some people claim to have great civilian health insurance experiences but... Even many of those people admit that something needs to change in the health care system. We can't keep going like this... We can't keep banging our head into the same fucking system and expect things to change.",momewraths,q4yx4r

Didn’t rape like alot of people did in the area at once 
He even actually when he finally got married it was to a lady who was like 15 years older than him and his boss which was unheard of at the time

Delusions exist in most. So not such an embarrassment or humiliating thing but a common formation issue. Often connected to sense of self.

Often schizophrenic episodes are moments of intense feeling and a cocktail of inaccurate summations of the whole experience. The mind takes control. But sometimes they pass if the mind can sort out the delusions. So yeah calmly approach as calmly as possible those types of issues.

While neurotransmitter imbalances (such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine) are often associated with depression, current understanding suggests that depression is a complex interplay of various factors, including genetics, environmental stressors, neural circuitry, and neuroplasticity.

That being said, SSRI’s may help to restore the imbalance. Treating depression does not solely rely on medication and involves lifestyle modifications as well (just like any other disease includes lifestyle modifications as well).

All I’m trying to say is, is that it’s nothing to be ashamed about when medication is needed to treat depression, because it is a medical condition and is not just “in your mind”.",Soft-Ad36,1cegm2j

For the first time in my life I really felt like I had a handle on keeping track of everything because of that planner.

Then covid happened, and the planner I'd gotten for this year suddenly felt almost meaningless. Everything was up in the air. Schedules were made up and the points didn't matter. I'm trying very hard to get back into my good habits again, but it's a struggle.

8,"Yes I can relate, although it's all relative. Sure the word ""stupid"" is nominative, I'm sure I would call myself stupid sometimes when other people don't realize my stupidity. I have such bad brain fog that it effects my memory and speech objectively too. 

It's more of an executive functioning thing for me, I literally can't do things consistently or focus sometimes, I get irritated due to depression. You are not alone, and the reason you probably asked the question is because like me you were insecure at one point in time about it.

It could be: 
Stress and cortisol due to everyday life. With a person that has mental illness it exacerbates the symptoms of stress. Everyone gets stressed, but few tend to understand that mental illness actually makes some people actually seem straight forgetful, disorganized, irritated, tired and can also give people coordination issues. 

I have some weird chronic fatigue issues with depression and it makes everything terrible. People have actually told me about my memory issues and it makes me very insecure. Now people can run their mouths all day about advice, but really the best thing you can do is to slowly recover through multiple ways:

- Sleep health is very important.
- Vitamins and nutrition
- Lower stress and meditate
- Exercise
- Don't isolate yourself, this can actually have drastic effects on your functioning.
- Find soft hobbies or companies, maybe pets to occupy or stimulate your mind
- Self compassion

Now worst is that you don't feel anything, but it can only help. And yes I understand when people say these things are easy, especially to someone with severe anxiety, it appears somewhat disingenuous... *Did it work for them?* I would say to myself. Just don't think about it like that, you know what's best for you... With help that is... Kind of a paradox... But you get the point.

I'm somewhat in recession regarding my depression I think (not sure how long it has to be to be called that way, but after years I've had more than a month very stable) I get very frustrated because I know I was sharper and faster-thinking before depression set in, and finding myself forgetting stuff in a minute makes me feel really stupid. Careful with that though, because it creates a vicious cycle.

Anyway. Yes the meds and the depression cause cognitive issues. Bah, the meds tend to make you drowsy and spaced out as they are meant to calm you down. I've relatively recently have read a few studies in which they track that even after achieving remission the cognitive symptoms can linger for many months after, but it's not something doctors seem to address very much in practice as the first priority is get you into remission. 

I spoke about it with my doctor and he says yes it is true, but once your stressors are better managed there can be slow improvement. I've been using one of those apps that have puzzles and activities for brains but I haven't used it consistently enough to give you a review. That said now that I haven't been depressed for a while I'm proud to say I picked up the first fiction book in nearly a decade  (the Blade Runner novel) and finished it in three days or so like it was the most normal thing and I was able to read normal without getting spaced out. So something got better now that my depression symptoms are at bay. I do get worse when anxious too, so I take it very seriously to stay away from known stressors that aren't necessary and make sure I have me time and stuff like that. 

Hope that gives you some optimism.",bellapippin,ioxaw0

54,"Hey,

First of all, I'm sorry you feel that way. Yes, I know how you feel. I suffer from anxiety and mild depression. I have gone through some tough things lately and they have a taken a toll on my mental health. But my mantra is that I won't let my trauma define my life for me. In other words, I do not want to give it power over my life. I'm not saying you can ever forget it but you can come to terms with where you are able to live life without it impacting your life in a negative way. It's easier said than done for sure. I was constantly thinking about what other people think of me but I read somewhere that I should live the life I want, not how other's think I should. Perhaps at the end of my life, I want to look back and be happy with the life I chose to live. Other people might have their opinions but only you know whats best for you. Remember, you are the one who has to deal with the consequences and/or benefits of the decisions you make. So make them based on what you think is best for you, not what other people think. I used to hold back from things (that aren't bad at all tbh, like for honest if I want to wear makeup) because I thought other people would judge me. But tbh I am happy when I wear makeup and if other people have a problem with it, it says something about them and not me. I know that's a silly example, possibly but hopefully you get my point. I am not telling you that you should not listen to other people but become more aware of the difference between genuine advice and unnecessary judgement. I did not notice that I got more forgetful and felt more stupid. To help with my forgetfulness, I got a planner that I used to plan my weeks and that I looked at everyday. It had a checklist in it. It honestly transformed my life. It's a small thing but it made a big difference. I was able to manage my time better. Another thing that helped me was to incorporate yoga and/or exercise at a particular time. Having a daily routine made things come naturally to me. I would totally recommend you set a daily routine that you don't have to follow rigidly the first few times but eventually you get the hang of it. As for feeling stupid, those are just FEELINGS. I read a book by a therapist and she made this point that feeling uncomfortable is normal to humans. The only difference between those who are confident and insecure is how they interpret this feeling. Insecure people see it as a FACT to their lack of intelligence and skills while confident people realize that it's just a feeling. She recommended that you make a list of all the accomplishments you've made in your life. They are evidence and a testament to your achievements and intelligence. Sometimes when our mental health is not in the right place, our minds give more weight to the negative things in our life despite all the tremendous amount of positive things in our life. Also, she recommended that whenever you get a negative thought or feeling, just actively talk yourself through it and tell yourself that it's okay to feel like this but it does not say anything about your intelligence. If I did bad on a presentation, instead of ""I did bad because I'm stupid"" I should think like ""My presentation could have been better but it's okay. I still gave it my best I could. I'll try to do better next time"". I also journal a lot especially when I'm stressed out. The number of times I have cried because of a thought and then I journal and everything becomes so clear. I don't know how to explain it but it's like I'm freewriting my thoughts on paper and as I keep doing so, things become clearer and clearer. I hope this helps you. If you want to talk more about this, I can try to give you more suggestions but these are the ones that have helped me the most. Also, know that you are not the only one who feels like this.

57,"Hey! I had saved this to come back to it! I kind of have had lapses in memory. I once posted a link in a group, and asked my friend to see it. A few days later, I asked him if he had seen the link I posted months ago according to me, and I posted the song again, and he goes, ""You posted this last Friday"", and I'm like ""What?"" :P :P :P I was super depressed then, and I wasn't keeping track of time. I really think our minds are too tired to keep track of things that aren't necessary according to it! My memory is fine btw. It still didn't remember when I posted that. I think memory exercises might help! There was a time when we used to remember phone numbers, now we kind of don't. We are getting a little lazy, we should also do stuff to improve our memory!   


As for you, you're perfect the way you are! You're amazing, and that doesn't diminish based on the ability of others to see it! :)  


You said that you were depressed!  I really think you need to take a break, try to understand what you want from life! Try to connect to yourself. Try to understand why you feel what you feel! It might be scary at first, but just because it's hard and scary doesn't mean it's bad, you know? It's like untying a knot! Life's about being happy! To be happy, you should get to a state in which you are not depressed. To get there, you need to ask your mind questions, why you feel what you feel, things like that!  


If your job is toxic to you, you should quit! If there are people that affect you in a bad way, you're allowed to not want them in your life! Don't do anything you don't like doing! All of these things affect you in a bad way!  


Connect to yourself! Ask yourself what you want from life! :) Life's about being happy, and doing what you love! Life's about having fun, and spending time with your loved ones! Life's about finding out what you're passionate about, and doing it! You're one in seven billion! You're perfect the way you are! Everyone's great at something, and everyone can be great at something if they do what it takes! Everyone is a genius in their own way! If you haven't found out what you're passionate about, keep looking! Here's the thing, people love watching passionate people do their thing! Whether it's streaming games, or singing, or whatever! Do something you want to do in life! Follow your passion! Follow your heart! If you do what you're passionate about, everyday, when you wake up, you'll embrace the day instead of going ""Ugh, I have to work today"", you know? It might not be sunshine and rainbows all the time, but it's something you want!  


You're perfect the way you are! We should always accept ourselves for who we are. If there's something you don't like about yourself, you can change it, but only for yourself, not for others. Others should accept you for who you are! You should accept others for who they are! Always be yourself!   


It's important to understand that there are things out of our control, and one shouldn't worry about things that we can't do anything about! What we do have control over, we can do something, so we shouldn't worry as much!  


I really wish this helped! :) Everything's going to be okay! :) I'm here if you ever need someone to talk to! :)",Dakshina7,ioxaw0

However, there are so many different kinds of medications and everyone responds to them differently, so you'll definitely want to talk to a professional who can evaluate you.

I can definitely understand the struggle of having low income. I don't know if your area is the same, but my city has a mental health/counseling center that operates as a nonprofit with a sliding scale based on income. When I started seeing a counselor and a psychiatrist here, I didn't pay anything for my visits, and they were able to get me pretty steeply discounted rates on my medication as well.

To say we experienced a traumatic childhood is just one part of the equation.

One person became a drug addict, many joined gangs, and others are simply unable to be in a happy, loving relationship or hold even regular friendships. Many don’t even have their drivers license because they’re too afraid to even do that. Being the youngest in the family, I had to break the cycle which is why I became educated, go to therapy, and work through every issue one day at a time.

In hindsight, I've often thought that serious exercise and better therapy would have been such a game-changer for me when I was young..

But hindsight is a nothing but a torture device. 

In any case I was diagnosed as ADHD/Bipolar (pre bipolar 1/2) when I was in middle schoo,  probably because I grew up in a crap neighborhood with a poor family, and getting sucked into the for-profit mental health system in a city like that is much like getting sucked into the for-profit prison system, albeit much less brutal. 

The mental health system is like a magnet. Every time you do something weird or get in trouble as a child for the rest of your life it is pegged on your mental disorder in a way which makes me confused as to how much the mental health system played a hand in my current mental disorders today.

After years in the mental health system I began to manipulate it, of course. By the time I was in film school, I was receiving two 30mg Adderall IR per day and two Xanax bars. 

This might sound like an exaggeration today, but this was during the late 90s, the days of the oxycontin belt. Big farmer I was having a field day back then. As they did with the antipsychotics they stuffed me with like a chicken when I was a kid. 

The Adderall did ""work"" for me, in the sense that it turned off my emotions, along with my empathy, in exchange for a delightful numbness shield which kept everyone at arm's length and a sharp productivity which kept me chasing that dollar. 

Every couple of years, I would suffer a major nervous breakdown, get depressed and start drinking,  or vice versa, or simply get monstrously depressed. I developed a unique system of safeguards to protect my professional life from the nuclear fallout of my episodes. The film business was perfect, because everybody works long hours, takes Adderall whether they should or not, ( seriously, it's the lifeblood of Hollywood) - and as a freelance worker, you can take work on commercials, burn Bridges and freak out every now and then, and never see those people again.

Perfect for a person who's ignoring their problems. 

I did enjoy a moderately successful career as a carpenter in the biz, but I was immensely lonely & distant for nearly 16 years. I zombied through a meaningless marriage. I developed multiple tactics to choke down emotion which I convinced myself were coping mechanisms. 

Life was...ok. 

Then, some people died, and I was hit by a forklift. No need for details, but these things ended the career and the marriage, and my ability to walk temporarily (!). 

Subsequently there was covid & the film industry strike. I was able to rehabilitate myself to the point of walking again, and peeing again and stuff, and I began drinking myself into oblivion.

I began staying awake a lot again..., then hallucinating, talking to myself, weird super low alcoholic things I'll spare everyone, & I scared my entire friends and family away. 

I wasn't violent or mean, and it was more awkward and complicated than ""scared them away,"" but unfortunately my family doesn't even believe mental disorders are real, despite doctors telling them so for years, so they just thought I'd lost it. I wrote this weird suicide note on Facebook that I honestly don't even remember.

The combination of pain and awkwardness exchange back and forth, coupled with the fact that I was learning to walk again without the help of my family and friends caused a rift that could not be repaired, also there was the exit of my wife....

Somehow I started doing street drugs, which really I didn't do as a teenager , besides weed. That's when I really lost it....I mean....I was flirting with death and insanity and psychedelic drugs as though they were one entity...I was trying so hard to lose consciousness.... But didn't quite have it in me to just do it, out of some sustaining, inexplicable curiosity. 

After ending up homeless my dad actually took me in. I got fully sober, even off the Adderall and Xanax. I still have to take a tiny bit of Klonopin so I don't have seizures.... But not for the rest of my life. I'm 37. 

I began being honest with my mental health professionals (seems like a waste of money not to be) , found the right medications (with time,) started to exercise like crazy, & found quite a nice balance in a simple life with my dad. 

But I've got a new diagnosis to wrap my head around.... disassociative identity disorder. Thinking about it makes my head hurt. I feel as though I'm looking back on my life. I don't want to work in the film industry anymore. I'm not sure I ever want to set foot in Los Angeles again.

 I am finally as balanced as all of my loved ones wanted me to be, finally ready to connect with people, and none of them will even speak with me. Not even my own brother. What's more is I never harassed my brother. he just got ""weirded out"" by most of the things I said. This was the case in most of my interpersonal relationships. 

So, I suppose I had a good run. Then I burned out. Now I have disassociation issues. Which I'll let you look up. Am I happy? 

Does happiness exist? I don't know. 

One things for sure, mental health issues are for life. And that thing about certain problems not surfacing until your 30s is a whopper. 

I felt like the Cheshire cat for the past three years. Before that, a zombie for 15. People liked me. Even loved me. I didn't even know how to be present. I do now, but no one's around. I have trouble finding motivation to build another life again. c'est la vie

24,I actually came on here to ‘vent’ for lack of a better word! It’s actually looking like I can’t avoid the topic because it’s been popping up in different places for the last couple of days. I wasn’t really sure how to describe what I been feeling for a while until just a little while ago- a podcast by mental health professional popped up on my YT feed- the topic “greaving unlived lives”.  That’s what I have been doing for a while now. Grieving over what could have been- in a fair world should have been! I mean I am really trying not to die on this hill… it could always be worse. Yet I am closer to 40 than I am 30 now. By no means am I suggesting that I am old and my life is over— thing I am so so so tired. I have had enough for multiple lifes over. I don’t think I can focus on being better so I can do better any more. I just need to focus on maintaining my current level of stability. I can’t help but feel bitter about the hands I’ve been dealt- most through no fault of my own. At the core of it all mental health- I spoke to my mother today and listening to her was hard. It’s been going on for generations and I have spent YEARS trying to unf*k myself so that my kids can have a glimmer of hope but I about lost that hope today. I have almost no doubt that their lives are gonna be better than mine- I have no doubt the road is still going to be incredibly difficult for them and I honestly I am scared to death of seeing them grieving their unlived lives.,Individual_Card4409,1aze2kc

I've made strangers contact me and offer to help. I've moved other people, but I can't seem to move myself enough to live life. You don't spend 30 years getting your mind and body destroyed, and fix it in 10. It's a process, and some of us get lucky and turn things around. Others, like me, are never the same and probably will never be the same. All because of the actions of the adults and authorities that were supposed to protect us, and instead failed us.

Brene Brown is an emotions researcher. I liked Atlas of The Heart for just outlines of different emotions. Daring Greatly was a good read too.


I really liked The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat. It's just about weird stuff our brains can do, across a number of neuroscience case studies. Gives a lot of perspective. 


Seneca's Letters from a Stoic is a good read, shows us that our problems aren't new, and the wisdom that resolves them isn't either. 



Bit more abstract is the Tao Te Ching. It's a book of poems from a few thousand years ago, introduces a few interesting ideas for being a person. You don't really need to care about Taoism to take something from it.

* Atomic Habits by James Clear.

* Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.

Who knew a ~2000 year old philosophy book would be any good for self improvement... anyway, the first few chapters do have value in the sense that they put things in proportion. I'm not sure if I can say it ticks the self help part though, it's a bit too abstract for that.

4,"I'm 33 and have been exposed to severe mental illness my whole life, and have struggled myself since I was 12.  We were taken away from my Mom when I was 5, but she was granted visitation rights not long after. I feel like I can see both sides of the aisle here. When mental illness completely obstructs awareness, it is naturally a turn off to ""normal"" people. This can come in all kind of different flavors which makes it tough. My mom has zero self awareness. She is completely steadfast in her beliefs (which are deluded and psychopathic), and when people meet that type of fracture between reality and illness presentation, it is scary (and traumatic for children). I deal with some delusions to find a place of safety. I mainly hold onto things that provided safety from my past, but people/situations change and I struggle with that. I am aware of my faults and habits, but still struggle to maintain it. I've noticed when my coping mechanisms are tied to people, they leave. I don't blame them, because it's not a typical coping mechanism. I have to build my own resilience so people don't feel that type of pressure. It's tough though (for reasons I could write an entire book about).",theumph,1c1ua6p

I wouldn't still be here if it wasn't for him.

Mental illness and struggles with mental health are not an excuse to throw yourself at others and become fully reliant or dependent on them. Love is not unconditional. I've left plenty of friendships behind because I was sick and tired of essentially being a full time caretaker to people who were supposed to be my friends.

Most jobs like that will not tolerate someone that keeps logging off in the middle of their shift as it screws up the whole team.

14,"I imagine that you have a case here! I can actually speak from the ""employer side"" a little bit as well, as I recently had to terminate somebody due to Bipolar outbursts. As a person with severe Bipolar myself, it didn't feel good, but it did, unfortunately, feel right. I am currently being raked over the coals about it, and we may even have to give her a pay out, but I don't care. Good for her if she does.   


She was unfortunately unable to control her outbursts, during training she had to be excused multiple times, and during scenario based training she was unable to pass due to being unable to maintain a calm demeanor. She is fighting it, and she is also demanding accommodations. In general I do believe accommodations should almost always be met, but out in the field, when she is responsible for someone's life, there is absolutely no accommodation that I can grant her. Every failure that she displayed in training would have been an innocent person's life in the real world. I am not prepared to put that on her, nor do I feel that this is an acceptable risk in the emergency services world. I am also completely unwilling to accommodate her by having her on scene in an inactive role.   


I am having to put together very detailed writeups about every outburst, as well as provide the video footage that we have of them (which I HATE, because of just how unbecoming the footage is), and explain why I am unable to accommodate her during operations.   


When I say ""terminate"" I don't even mean fired, I mean just that I found her unsuitable for the job we do (We are a small, highly specialized team exclusively deployed when the situation is too unsafe for general duty employees) and had her sent back to her old position.   


This is going to be hell, and I am going to ""lose"" for sure, but in a weird way it is making me happy to see that there is this ability to advocate for yourself, and fight for yourself. I am happy that there are avenues that she was able to take, and I am happy that she may get something out of it too. Getting a pay out (we will 100% settle if it goes that way) for getting a position that you are unable to do doesn't quite send the right message either, but it's better than the opposite direction.",Beginning-Pace-1426,144n13d

I’m still going to work but all of my after work activities have stopped,  so now when I get home I just work on the stuff I’m trying to learn.  I play 2 instruments (one not very well but I’m learning), and I’m also learning to draw, and since the quarantine I’ve started doing yoga every day with videos from YouTube.  I’ve had back pain for almost a year now because of a slipped disc and the quarantine has finally given me the time to actually do something about it.  

Another factor for me is that when this started both of my roommates went to stay with other people, so I’ve been home alone too, which is way less stressful for me.  I can make as much noise as I want at whatever times I want, which is nice.

I haven’t seen my fiancé in over a week at this point, since someone at my work got covid-19 I’ve been self quarantining and only going to work and home.  I miss him, but it has been interesting to see all the other ways I could spend that time that I was spending with him.

104,"Mine has def improved. I’m a 30 year old female union factory worker. My job is extremely physical and strenuous, but i NEED it for the money and mostly the health insurance. For 11 years from age 18-29 i didnt have health coverage. I saw a few different therapists through referrals from the free clinic i went to, but it didnt really help. Over that decade i was in college for 2.5 years and ended up just not going back one day and leaving bc everything in my life was too much. I live in a very toxic household and started working at age 14, and tried college so i could not end up like my parents... and in that time i tried at least 5 different SSRIs (anti depressants) but they didnt really ever work.

During the year prior to me starting my job at Ford (and having health coverage) I was In a very bad place. A new SSRI seemed like it was helping a little bit possibly, but it caused me to do stuff in my sleep and it was scary. I tried a new one and it made me worse, which is something i had felt the SSRIs had always done, thats why i never took them for long. At about age 22 i started to realize more and more that i knew what was wrong with me mentally, but i didnt have the health coverage to actually find out. 

Age 29 my insurance was finally in full swing and i made an appointment with a psychiatrist and was finally properly diagnosed. She said that I have bipolar disorder (what i figured it was for years) and that anti depressants actually make you WAY worse and cause you to “rapid cycle”...she is still my psychiatrist and i have also been seeing a therapist. Even though I’m really unhappy at my job i need it for the excellent pay, and free, amazing, health insurance. It’s saved my life.

On the 13th of March I worked my last shift due to COVID-19. that week i only worked 2 out my 4 shifts bc i was in a bad place mentally that week and i used my two days that i am allowed to use if i need a mental health day. I get two days a month that i can use to stay home if needed through my FMLA (family medical leave act) paperwork. So my check that week was only fir 2 days. Luckily the week before i got my yearly profit sharing check so i had a decent amount of cash at the time...so for the first 3 weeks of not working i had no money worries even though i didnt have any coming in. 

During the first 3 weeks of being laid off i have been in such a great place mentally. I have been painting, crafting, cleaning, organizing, reading, started a new skin care routine, writing, sleeping well and napping sometimes, cooking for myself and the family ( due to my work hours i can’t due this generally)... i have been in a really great place mentally, and i know it’s bc i have not had to work. However, due to all this i had to blow that money and I’m getting really scared that i will not be able to move into my friends apartment in June when their roommate leaves as planned. Which is something that i REALLY need in order to prosper. Two days after valentines day last year my boyfriend of 3 years that i lived with woke up one morning and dumped me and kicked me out of our apt...three days after being added to my phone contract and getting new phones... and a week after i got in a terrible car accident totaling my 3 month old car and breaking my sternum...he was an asshole i guess, and i had to move back home, and buy a bed and a car... so this past year i have been rebuilding my life. 

So yes, for the first 3 weeks i was in an amazing place mentally, bc i didnt have the stress of my job. Ive already been aware that i feel i only have 5-10 good years of working full time in me. My job is so exhausting and since I’m on an assembly line it’s all mindless, physical work that leave me trapped in my head for 12 hours straight. Plus the hour commute back and forth, i can’t do anything but work, eat, sleep during my work week. I know I’m only 30, but ive been working since i was 13, and have always worked very hard trying to get away from my toxic life. I have already feared that i mentally won’t be able to handle full time for that much longer, and this real segmented that I’m right. That work is too stressful at times for my mental health to be able to get up on time, get myself out of bed, get there on time and do the work. I can go a month without needing a break but if i have a bipolar episode i don’t know when it comes, what to expect, or how long it will stay. I mean, i can be a feminist and know that at the end of the day i need extra care, and if i get married I’m gonna need someone that understands that, and i can hopefully go to working part time only, and somewhere much easier, and that i may actually enjoy. 

So now that my money is gone, and my unemployment still has yet to start coming in, i am starting to get really anxious. Also, i live bear chicago and northwest indiana, so the weather is really changing. When the weather starts getting nice, and i can smell it in the air, and it’s sunny out, i get really really anxious. I don’t know what it is, like reverse seasonal affective or perhaps my body remembering trauma. My first, clear, bipolar depressive phase started at age 22, at this time when the weather was changing for spring. It lasted til October and for the first time i understood how people could end their life. I was no stranger to depression, but this was different. For some reason i knew i would never be the same. Now, bc of that long bipolar episode i get super anxious at even the smell of nice weather. Not always, but it can be bad when it does.

So, i was in a really good place during this for weeks. The happiest i had been in a VERY VERY long time. But I’m super anxious now....however, i think if my unemployment was coming in i would still be in a great place... i really do hope that you feel better. If you need to talk you can send me a PM, all i have is time... just know that you are not alone. We are a community.",slashleyyy89,fx2qdr

108,"Yeah man.  Idk if it just feels easier for some (and is actually jeopardising their recovery) or if it actually benefits some, but my mental health is taking a hit.

Uni moved online, now can't keep up with material and assessments, nor can I work sitting in the same place all day in my room, so I just dropped all the subjects (real shame because this was the first in like 4 semesters I was actually making progress and looking to sit some exams), the gym closed so all those goals are kinda fucked - fitness also because I can't really run too regularly because of my feet - and the mental health benefits of doing shit has gone, I don't get outside enough and in general am just flattening quite a bit.

Thing is it's not wasted time.  In times where you can't do things, improve, expose yourself to new experiences, maintain some of your hobbies, exercise fully or even work, you can always practice mindfulness - in fact this is the best time to do so.

It's important just to keep a few good habits going:

Brushing your teeth/ washing daily

Eating regularly and focus on nutrition (try to get enough healthy fats, proteins, vitamins, fibre, antioxidants in your day and avoid processed sugars and saturated fats - especially as being in quarantine, these sugars and sat fats just weaken your tolerance to life).  Maybe you can even hit a caloric defecit and lose some fat if you want, although not recommended for weight trainers who want to maintain muscle mass.

Exercising - go for a run, do some pushups every 2nd hour, some Turkish getups maybe, single leg squats etc. This really revolutionizes your mindset for days even after one thing (one set of pushups at max reps at the start of the day can make the difference between a good day and a shit one).

Outside - go for a walk or sit in the sun for any amount of time.  This does a similar thing as exercising.

Any discipline - people don't like doing nothing.  We like to think we like doing nothing so that we trick ourselves into being motivated to do things with the promise of respite afterwards, but we only like recovering from hard work, not doing nothing.  For this reason, it is much more beneficial to read stimulating material, learn things in depth or generally improve at things - vegetating on the couch watching netflix or gaming (not all gaming ofc) will just lower your resilience and generally decrease your sense of purpose.

Instead, try to find something you want to do, or have been meaning to do but been putting off, and focus all other energy on that.  Of course if you have just about any solid responsibility in this time, most of your resources will probably will be preoccupied with dealing with that.  If you have few commitments though, finding something productive is a great way to make use of your time.

For me, I've been meaning to read Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky and Solzhenitsyn for a while - maybe I'll read war and piece.  I've been reading Aurelius, and have been wanting to read up on Epictetus.  Similarly I've been practicing my trumpet improv which needs a lot of work, and bettering my poker game.  I still have a few things to do with uni (study some prerequesites but also just general academic interests) so I've been doing that too.

These probably won't apply to you, but the point is if I do all of these (in order), it becomes a lot harder to have a bad day.  If I have a bad day, it's normally because I have failed to do one of the things, and really that is just a lack of discipline.",bolognie1,fx2qdr
109,"Mine has gotten significantly better!! Because I no longer have to go to work every day and fake a smile 24/7, drain myself verbally and mentally keeping small talk with older clients and coworkers, physically try to walk around like I don’t have a weight on my shoulders nobody can see(my mom is a high functioning suicidal alcoholic with a xanax prescription she abuses, and verbally abuses me though I literally do every thing for her including cooking all of her meals and cleaning her room/the apartment, and is currently living with my bf and I as my dad recently split from her and he no longer is there to keep an eye on her/monitor her drinking and suicidal ideation, and my older brother no longer cares). Simply not having to act like I am happy when I am severely depressed with generalized anxiety(and on medication + doing biofeedback on myself at work), and also deal with work stressors, has been life changing. 

I love my job, and at my lowest points it was/is the thing that keeps me going. But the rude parents and lower end spectrum clients I work with can be so hard to work with(keeping that fake smile) 5 days a week with such difficult personal life problems. I was also working overtime on top of this for the last three months(mom moved in 4 months ago), so I don’t get home till about 7:30-8 most nights when I’m at work by 9-9:30 am. Eating dinner that late after I cook it, and it sometimes being my only real meal of the day was just another thing bringing me down. Now I have time to make food and actually enjoy eating it!

Things are hard at home sometimes, but if I isolate myself in my room and avoid my mom at all costs/bite my tongue, things are pretty damn good. I’ve been quarantined along with all of them(we all got over the virus!) for over four weeks and I couldn’t be happier.",there_u_are,fx2qdr

Just making a single noise would lead to everyone screaming at you. And I end up having to take my anger out on literally anything because of being so constantly exhausted. Like my bro just asks where the milk is and I end up being pissed at him for no reason.

124,"I LOVE and flourish at both of my jobs and can't wait to get back to them when things settle down, but when things got shut down it felt like a load off my shoulders; a break to catch my breath a bit. Even though I'm an extrovert, the idea of staying at home for a bit seemed like a vacation, but without the annoying bits of going through an airport or finding someone to watch the dogs.

My partner wasn't affected by the transition to work from home, so they're still working a regular 9-5 schedule. So worrying about how we're going to pay the mortgage or buy groceries is thankfully not something that I worry about. 

At the start I was crazy productive doing things around that house that I have been meaning to do for ages, started a garden, sanded and restained the outdoor furniture, cleaned the garage... so many things. That was Mid-March?

Now, I'm still forcing myself to do things. Cook dinner, clean the house, make the bed, laundry, mow the yard/misc. yard work, all necessary errands (grocery shopping, picking up dog's medications, etc.) but I'm crying at the drop of a hat. I feel so overwhelmed and drowning, but I don't know what I'm drowning in, if that makes sense.

So, to be honest, I'm not sure how I'm doing. I thought I was doing okay, but now I don't know. I come from a long history of depression and the past few years, after I quit a terrible career and transitioned into a 180\* opposite career, have been the most stable, happy, and optimistic I've been since I was 14?

I’m a single guy, living a lone, not able to visit my parents across town because I would hate for them to become ill if I am carrying the virus.  Not being in a relationship, and the prospect of not finding a partner in a bar or coffee shop has this feeling like a really lonely time right now.

I was also convinced that my mother and my cat were spying on me and constantly watching me. 

I am also TERRIFIED to leave the house. Even just going outside into my garden was really difficult at first. If I had planned a supper and I didn’t have an ingredient, I would change my whole meal instead of going to the small shop down the road which almost always has no people in it. I also can’t wear an n95 mask because I don’t like anything touching my face and I feel like I can’t breathe in them and that sets off an panic attack.

While the state I currently live in, NM, seems to be handling the whole thing better than some, I've been appalled by the lack of care from most that live here in this stateline community. Being right next to TX, there exists that more militant ""my rights"" type of mindset that some just have to be proudly vocal of. Of course I've been dealing with that on some level since moving out here eight years ago. So again, really thinking the next best thing once this all settles down a bit is to run with my move into a further remote area.

Of course apart from a small subsistence garden, I'll probably have to look into some other profession that doesn't require leaving the future homestead much. Kind of a hard thing in and of itself to do when I barely graduated high school 19 years ago and have only recently managed to get my footing in a troubling subject like college algebra.

0,"1. Identify all the emotions you are experiencing, as specifically as you can, and be honest with yourself. This will help your mind to begin to dissociate from it; you are not your emotions, you are simply experiencing them.

2. Try to identify what's causing each emotion, the actual core reason; Google the ""5 whys"" technique, it works wonders. Understanding what's fuelling your emotions will highlight paths that will help you alleviate/prevent them.

3. Make changes in your daily routine/life to improve your mental fitness; stop/deal with anything that's fueling negative emotions, and do more of what is fueling your positive emotions.

Remember, the body also needs balance. Diet & exercise are also key factors to maintaining mental fitness (as physical fitness influences mental fitness).

i think no one is too old for a breakdown or meltdown, they are just our body's way of releasing intense, strong emotions we need to get rid of. i always think back to why young kids have meltdowns: it's because they can't handle their big emotions. sometimes we oldies need that too. it is okay to feel all of the emotions, even the bad ones. good luck to you friend <3

It's fine to let it out. I think in my case at least, I need to be able to manage my thoughts or emotions or something better. If I handled things better emotionally, and didn't let stuff overwhelm me and get to me like they do, it wouldn't boil to a point where it comes out in a massive meltdown.

It can be hard to unlearn this sort of ideology, and even when you become aware of the fact it’s normal it can feel wrong to let yourself be vulnerable especially if you’re used to bottling it up. 

I will say though that there’s nothing pathetic about having a breakdown, as much as we may sometimes feel otherwise it’s a normal thing especially if you’re struggling with a disorder that makes emotional processing harder. I’m 22 and still struggle with mental breakdowns, I don’t necessarily “cry it out” as you said I don’t really cry at all during them but I know the feeling regardless. Emotion is a part of life, it’s important to being a human being, and some people struggle more due to other factors. There is nothing “pathetic” about being a human being, and there is no age cap for experiencing strong emotion.",Ezrasbignuts,16uox8v
31,"I am autistic and that sounds strangely close to my ""meltdowns"", which is a bit different from an actual breakdown. If it's shorter lived then that's not a breakdown, it's usually a meltdown rather than a breakdown. I get that it's embarrassing but it's normal as hell. You are human. And whatever the word you use, I promise there are hundreds of millions of people who are going through the exact same situations are you are, at the exact same age. So no - it's not pathetic. It's natural and it's okay, and you are fine just the way you are (other than the fact that clearly these are hard on you and I wouldn't wish any suffering and hope you can find ways to cope and soothe). The last thing you should be worried about is being a bother. If you are struggling, you are struggling, and that's not your fault. It's really hard, but try to be a bit compassionate with yourself. Try to internalize that. Maybe therapy could help, but it may be something you're stuck with for life, and it's really just a matter of finding the best ways to deal with it. If you have the chance, try making a pre-recorded message/text on your screen of your phone, explaining very short that you need some time and can't explain right now. Just have that and show it, because it can be very hard to convey things during a situation like that. It did wonders. I hate when people try to pressure me to talk when I'm like that, so I just show them the phone and wait for a bit, then I explain properly later. Anyway, sorry you are going through that. Just please try to be gentle and compassionate with yourself. You are only human. *hugs*",,16uox8v

Stop calling it a meltdown and all these negative terms. You are creating your own suffering by seeing it as negative. Even though others don’t understand it and it seems out the norm / no one human is the same so we are all unique. 

Honor your inner world - thank God you have an outlet for your emotions. Care for it and expand it - journal when you cry, maybe go for a walk with dark sunglasses in nature and cry among the trees - trees will always reflect back to you that you are safe and one of them.

Loss of health
Loss of mobility

Pathetic, meltdown, etc.  are words I doubt you would use in reference to someone else.

Call what you go through by any name you want. You're describing the same thing no matter what words you are using. So, please stop using them at all
 The last thing you need is someone down on you because of what your dealing with

I know nothing about who or.what type of professional you were seeing,  My first question would be was it helping you? Did anyone suggest medications to you to perhaps give your brain a vacation from all you're dealing with and maybe even harder, what you're trying to deal with.

Imo, professionals involved with you will be/can be unbelievably helpful. But you need to get something out of the time, as well as the money spent.

Did you connect with the pro you saw? Was is therapy/counselor or medical/psychiatrist?

Did the pro give you anything to work on/focus on, between sessions?

Did you do them? If not, who cares? This is a new day and there might have been a hundred reasons for not doing them, starting with ""I just didn't effin want to!""

And I got news for you. You see people have breakdowns almost every day, I'm sure. Lose your temper at someone or something. Get frustrated and want to give up on something. Get mad at yourself because of what you think you are or are not? 

Those are irrational acts that people do every day. You sound like your just having more disturbing ones.

Pathetic is not a verb. I believe it would be considered an adverb. I'm a long time out of English classes, and wasn't a star anyway.

Actually, I wasn't a star at anything. Maybe a ""C"" on average, at best. Certainly not better than a ""D"" or an ""F"" at life. Almost all of my life. You don't sound a whole lot different than me or about half my family.

IMHO, I think you may need to reboot. Start over with a new, uncorupted drive.
You can't go forward if your having to drag around everything from this morning  on back. 

IMO, If i was starting over, I'd want to investigate and use every tool available
But this time I wouldn't spend so much time trying to fix myself, myself.

So, not that you asked, but where are we gonna go from here? People who have been thru this kinda stuff or are going thru this kinda stuff want to help. None of us wants to see anyone go thru what we did or are going thru.

Find someone, if you can, who's kind and compassionate. Someone you trust

Want to DM me, whatever that is? I'll listen. And I won't tell you what to do. How would I know what you should do?
But I'll listen. And I'll ask a few questions. Probably mention what I did and all thst didn't

Meet me half way and I'll do everything I can, if and only if you want to. If you just want to vent or blow off steam, that's fine.

But lord, please stop trying to do this by yourself. Who, in any profession coaches themselves, and succeeds? Mike Tyson didn't do so good by himself. Neither did Ali, when he went ""independent""

Do yourself a favor. Don't wait as long as I and so many others do to get serious about working on your stuff. I'll bet most never do.

But, no, you certainly are not pathetic
A big problem you may also be fighting is that you think you are.

Regardless, best wishes and best of luck.
I sincerely mean that from the heart,
Rich

PS: Have an arrow for good luck, ok?
Don't give up just yet I was and at times feel that I'm the biggest mess to date
And that ain't no fun.

I feel like that makes sense about antidepressants because if you’re not depressed, you just have sudden onset meltdowns, an antidepressant probably isn’t the right move. Meds wise for me I like gabapentin because I also have chronic pain so it’s a two for one. 


I would suggest a good pair of noise cancelling headphones. 
One thing that works for me personally is this stuff even though it’s technically for kids https://www.theottoolbox.com/heavy-work-activities/

Unfortunately the first step before you can develop any coping skills for meltdowns is to work on figuring out awareness of your triggers and being able to notice signs that it’s about to go down which was so much effort to figure out. 
I don’t know if you’re interested in finding ways to reduce the frequency of meltdowns but this was my personal experience on going from probably a meltdown every two days to more like every 3 weeks or so.",Sharktrain523,16uox8v
92,"Yes I’ve tired DBT (&CBT) but I don’t think my brains understand how to “accept” an emotion.

Yes I do remember hearing my psychiatrist say that ADHD brains are typically 3 years ‘behind’ neurotypicals, as in, if I’m 25 now, I have the brain of a 22 year old. Which is SO relatable because I’ve always felt disconnected in school. Like how is everyone understanding this when I’m not? I need things explained to me in like 5 different ways I order for me to truly understand it. Which I think gets annoying to others, especially when I’m like, “wait can you explain that again but with an example?” Or something. But I’m just a really curious person to begin with and I love to learn so I want to learn right.",asianstyleicecream,16uox8v

There are really a lot of people reposting fake positive mental health posts who never even tried to understand my diagnosis when i opened up with them...
I also have a huge problem with people on social media not actually having mental illnesses, but saying they are depressed and joking about killing themselves when they have a bad day or too much to study...
Should we even mention the lack of trigger warning when talking about self harm or SA?

3,"Instagram has easily become a place of competing at who's life highlights are the best. That's all it is. All other tools it offers - networking, showcasing a portfolio, selling products - have been squashed mostly by the users themselves, and by Instagram after that, pushing paid services to its front and leaving the breadcrumbs of reach to everyone else. Talking about mental health is no exception - it's become a trend there, like traising awareness about the environment, or discrimination, yet all you see there are mostly pretty quotes from people who just want to impress and appear like they are trying to save the world. Nobody shares actually useful information like studies/real-life stories/info on who to reach out to for help.

7,"I deleted Instagram bc I noticed the effect it had on my health. I thought it was because I was seeing the lives of ppl I knew. Then I tried Tiktok for a few weeks and realised it made me feel even worse than the few years I had Instagram for. I still use some social media, but it's much more limited, at least time wise. I have Snapchat purely for one group chat with my housemates. I use WhatsApp to talk to family, I use Discord, Reddit, Pinterest and Tumblr because the atmosphere is different and it's more of a way for me to engage with my actual interests. Social media doesn't have to be bad, but we need to recognise what makes it unhealthy for us, and when it is. I wish I had deleted Instagram earlier, and I wish I had never downloaded Tiktok, as deep down I knew it wouldn't be good for me. 

I'm not saying no one should use Tiktok or Instagram or quit all social media. If you delete it all, it's not like all of your problems will disappear, and your mental health won't automatically improve, although in my case it did lower my anxiety quite a bit. Social media can connect people if you use it right, but some platforms are less suited towards it, and it all depends on your mindset towards it too; I recognise that my mindset was unhealthy, and it's my responsibility to take care of it. Even now, I take a lot of breaks from social media and will delete social media apps on my phone whenever I recognise that I'm using it mindlessly or as a time filler; there are better things I can do that I enjoy more to fill my time.",,mld4qm

I felt kind of silly about it at first but with some deeper thinking I’ve concluded that tik tok is just random Internet bullshit. Whereas (for me), Instagram is full of people I actually know. And it’s all a highlight reel. I watch my own friends post things that make their lives look so cool, but I know their real lives at home and all the bullshit. 

I follow people who I don’t even care about but I feel like it’s awkward to unfollow. I follow random accounts that I thought I’d enjoy but really I just don’t care. 

I myself was posting simply for attention. Posting stories of my food or my body while I’m at the gym. And the realization that nobody gives a fuck is both comforting but upsetting. You drain your own energy posting things that nobody cares about.

19,"Honestly, I think it’s just a social media thing. Ironically, I admit to using Reddit a lot but I feel like Reddit (the only social media I use besides YouTube) actually has a few things to offer if you use it correctly. Instagram, on the other hand, offers very little benefits and, to me, is a waste of time. I deleted my Instagram for that very reason and I’ve never had the urge to run back to it.

And like you mentioned, a lot of people use Instagram, specifically, in a very.... fake way. A lot of people use the platform to sort of virtue signal and show the best sides of them selves. And the worst part about it is the fact that no one cares. I’m not saying this in a belittling or mean way- I mean, when you see someone post something on Instagram, unless it’s actually interesting, you just continue scrolling. So, ultimately, you end up with a shit load of people thinking they’re posting something that people will stop and look at but, in reality, no one will. Everyone kinda lives in their own little bubble on Instagram and most people don’t even realize it. 

Adding on to what you already mentioned in your post, these are a few other reasons why I think Instagram is bad for mental health.",money4213,mld4qm
20,"Popular social media especially since the pandemic has just been fucked man. When everyone was posting tiktoks and stories of them doing push ups and workout challenges last year was when I really got fed up.. purely because there’s no gym to go to so they rely on the constant validity of recognition and likes online.. I’ve gone through continuous phases of deleting social media apps, disabling accounts and hopefully will delete Facebook and Instagram accounts soon for good. I know so many people on there who are toxic assholes irl but praise mental health, posting quotes on their stories and I just sit back and think to myself I know who you really are. I find myself becoming toxic when I use it too much and it has even affected my relationship in the past on occasion. Its awful and the only people cut out for it are the ones who want to join in the fakeness competition of who’s life can look the best. Just a bunch of fake people. Sure some actually may have good intentions to spread awareness of vital news. But when we are in the generation of the self, predominantly all you will see on every account is a facade. The fact is everyone now is just too concerned with their egos when we are meant to be dealing with catastrophic global crises. Again, not just with mental health, but with global events, such as global warming or BLM, posting a black square or posting a dying species or forest on your story ain’t gonna do shit.

I also remember following some hashtag, Motorhead I think, and it got me thousanda of posts in my feed of things that specifically wasn't motorhead, and no actual posts about motorhead. Just posts of literally every other band, every video that used music of vaguely similar kinds of music, makeup videos, sports I don't follow.

There was countless nights between 2004-2008 that I had to stay up because someone was threatening suicide and blamed the suicidal thoughts on loneliness, daring anyone to prove them wrong that ""no one would even care"".

And before that stuff it was on AIM away messages where you'd be frantically begging someone to tell you they're okay and trying to bargain/barter with them.

Started self harming about 6 years ago, which no one knew abour for the first 5 years, always wore long sleeves, sweaters and all, but it got to a point of needing to get stitches about 7 months ago, cut too deep in my leg and even though my parents thought I stopped cutting, I had to go to the hospital somehow so I showed them and my dad drove me to the hospital, my underwear was soaked in blood, pants and all, was kinda panicking at first.

I overall missed out on life heavily, feeling extremely lonely, afraid of life, afraid of any social interaction and started getting panick attacks at the start of last year (which was no joke, that was the worst I've felt in my life by far, this was also the time I showed someone (my parents) my scars and told them about my struggles for the first time), which pushed me to get out and do stuff, pushed me to be more social and face my fears, I've come a long way and am actually in a relationship now, yet I still feel extremelt self concious, loads of self hatred and get very anxious needing to go out and talk to people, get into social situations and all and still have suicidal thoughts at times.

There is no logical reason why it would cost so much, even if the day was filled to the brim with therapy.

They're transplanting tissue for gods sake. Even if what the surgeon makes and the cost for being at the hospital where non-existant, it would still cost tens of thousands. Mental health treatment can vary widely between countries, phallo costs 50.000 - 70.000 wherever you go. Surgery actually costs money, its a fact of life. Ofcourse there are countriea where insurance will pay a certain amount or even everything, but that cost is non-negotiable.

Edit: Also you saying ""simple phalloplasty"" makes me think you don't actually know how many surgeries it takes. Like there are almost ten steps involved to getting a dick, which each in and of itsself is a massively invasive surgery and depending on the hospital they'll do multiple steps in one surgery, but you're gonna have to go under at least three times.

That means that all stages are performed at once, and the only stage ""missing"" that usually happens in multiple-stage phallo is metoidioplasty.

And I dont mean cursing mean actual screaming.

So during the Stay it was not easy either.

Don't let that discourage you tho.
You get help in many factors in what is troubling the mind so.
And from there you can move on.

It's possible to have a panic attack. But actually doing the thing is not the typical outcome, and I've actually never heard of it happening. The whole point of intrusive thoughts is they are unreasonable and dont reflect reality, and treating them as if they do like checking yourself into a mental facility so you ""aren't a danger to others"" is reassures the thought as having validity. Harm intrusive thoughts are the most terrifying and miserable types, but in the end, it would be insanely unlikely for OP to act on them despite how they feel, and its actually more likely they would have a bad experience at the facility.

ITs are like delusions and avoiding triggers by admitting yourself is a compulsion, which is what you need to stop to make the suffering from the thoughts repeating stop. Even people with suicide intrusive thoughts are advised to NOT call a hotline. ITs are not like desires or tics they are just fears of acting out.

Dude, my intrusive thoughts have been about hurting other people for the past ELEVEN years. I’ve never hurt anyone and  never had the urge to hurt anyone.

The problem is that sometimes my brain asks me things like ”what if you’re capable of hurting someone? What if you’re a psychopath? What if you have hurt someone? Are you secretly a bad person?” Then I obsess over these thoughts, googling symptoms of psychopathy, avoiding sharp objects etc.

Violent INTRUSIVE thoughts are pretty common for people with ocd yet those thoughts don’t make us hurt people. It’s people like the one’s in this comment section making assumptions about a disorder they know nothing about, who make people with ocd afraid of seeking help.

0,"Sure! Happy to help. Here are 10 tips to improve mental health.   


1. **Regular Exercise:** Physical activity can boost your mood and reduce stress. I am sure you have heard of this, but endorphins are released during exercise.  If you take your exercise outdoors, you will get a bonus of stronger immune system as well as less anxiety/depression. 
2. **Healthy Diet:** Eating nutritious food can support brain function and overall well-being. I will be a bit of an outsider here and argue that you should really be focusing on raw food here, especially green leafy vegetables. Try adding a salad a day to your diet and see what happens. Also, please don't add fried protein/tons of cheese to it.
3. **Adequate Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night for optimal mental health. If you have trouble falling asleep, be mindful of turning off all screens 2 hours before and see if that helps you. 
4. **Mindfulness and Meditation:** Practices like mindfulness and meditation can help manage stress and improve focus. You can go for the trifecta and take a mindful walk for 30 minutes a day outdoors. See tip #1. 
5. **Limit Screen Time:** Reduce excessive screen time, especially before bed, to promote better sleep. Besides, when we are watching tv or on our phones, what good comes from it? Whatever we consume, impacts our mental health. So make health choices when it comes to your choice of entertainment. 
6. **Social Connections:** Maintain healthy relationships and connect with loved ones regularly.  In Person!
7. **Set Realistic Goals:** We are all striving to accomplish or acquire something. In order to do that, we need to break tasks into manageable steps and celebrate small achievements.
8. **Manage Stress:** Find healthy ways to cope with stress, such as deep breathing exercises or engaging in hobbies.
9. **Seek Support:** Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or mental health professionals  (including mental health coaches) if you need help. I fell in love with coaching because my coach not only held me accountable and helped me accomplish my goals, but she was also there when I just needed to chat or work through things that loved ones could not help with. 
10. **Practice Gratitude:** Cultivate a positive mindset by focusing on what you're thankful for each day. If you do nothing else, PLEASE DO THIS. Have a journal by your bedside and before you go to sleep at night, write down 3 things minimum that you are thankful for. Do this every night and watch your life change for the better! How? Because gratitude forces you to think broadly about your circumstances rather than focusing on a few small negatives.  It helps you put things in perspective. AND you began to build up a positive momentum that is unstoppable. You began to notice more and more things to be grateful for AND more good just naturally comes your way because of it.",JClementMD,1ccukpx
0,"Well i would definitely keep communicating with him as much as possible, even if it’s only from your side. You can ask him if he would be okay with you sending him messages that he doesn’t have to respond to if he doesn’t want to. things like “Hope you’re doing okay today!” “enjoy the weekend!” “Make sure to stay hydrated!” little things like that could really help. As someone with 8 years of personal experience with depression, we often tend to think we aren’t good enough for the people around us, thinking we are a burden to them. so when someone shows you that you aren’t, it’s very much “a small gesture goes a long way” type of situation.",Listronwastaken,1cdly7i

They can guide you through the legal and ethical processes to ensure you receive the care you need, even if your parents are resistant. Your health and safety come first, and there are avenues to pursue appropriate treatment despite familial obstacles.

I am a register nurse - currently with a lapsed license and fighting wrongful imprisonment with two felony charges for assault against a correction officer ..

I have changed jobs frequently I am a registered nurse but also work for my dads tree service Falls Tree Experts and I like the flexibility of having different roles to play throughout the work week… anyway I had a job at Cleveland CLinic Main campus in Cleveland Ohio it’s one of the top cardiac hospitals in the world and I was hired to work as a nursing assistant in the J unit 12 cardiac units including the top VIP unit.. I had amazing training from a staff nurse for about two weeks.. then they had random nursing assistants continue the training some of which only worked there a short time and they would show me how to do things the ‘easier’ way but it was not to protocol and it was so frustrating because I just wanted to do it proper… one of my trainers even took me into the break room and showed me a big bottle of powdered adderall which she scooped up and swallowed in front of me?!!!! I should have reported this but I just dealt with it and then when it was time for me to be on my own I was so unprepared - I ended up Just quitting and got a pink slip.. it was such an amazing opportunity … 

I have had MANY cases of jobs where the people, places, things… or my ability to adapt to the work flow was off.. I feel like I over complicate things , and make mountains out of nothing. My anxiety and stress def effect my ability to perform at work.. I’m bipolar with schizoaffective features and I take antipsychotics mood stabilizers anti anxiety’s etc. NO narcotic because I had a drug misuse issue with vyvamse and adderall .. my drugs make me feel like a milk dud so I crave stimulants bc they place me in a good focused mindset - but I don’t use them as prescribed and I take tooo many and have delusions. And then I’m hospitalized … medications are changed .. I fall into a severe depression  and slowly over 6-month to a year begin to start taking care of my self a little better but medications are still causing side effects like 70 pound weight gain and lack of interest in doing anything .. laziness.. etc 

I just got out of HIghland Springs in Highland Heights, Ohio.. I voluntarily admitted myself- I drove to the facility and packed clothes , books, lotion, perfume and other things to makes the stay. A little more enjoyable… I ended up is sleeping  for 7 straight days… my bed and personal area was a mess with chips crumbs everywhere and fruit flies … at least I started taking a hot shower with the face wash and shampoo and conditioner I packed and changed my clothes … but there was nothing to do on. The unit .. 

NOTHING. They take grown adults and literally just put them in a cage… hours seem like years- and you hve  very minimal interaction with your psychiatrist therapist and social worker..: they come in to your room while your passed out, chips all over the place… and try to communicate serious important things with me and I’m just not in the right state of mind and I Just kind of mope through the conversation and agree with what they say so I can get back to my drooling, deep naps w crazy vivid dreams from the nicotine patches… BUT I am now off lithium… which is the golden standard for bipolar disorder ../  and i think that will be a good thing…

Thanks for the rant - I am 31 years old and I am very isolated I don’t have many people in my life other than my immediate family and health care providers and probation etc..

Next time I was at a way different job. Still, toxic shit. That time I worked until I knew i was stable  - it was incredibly difficult to keep pushing. Try and derive some sort of joy or meaning out of it other than what I would reap on the other side of my goal. But I recognized it was toxic, and I was able to recognize I needed to leave. I got to a place where I valued my time and labor enough to recognize that I didn't have to feel guilty for that. I wasn't a bad person for finding something I actually maybe enjoyed, at least didn't make me curl up in a ball after every 4 hour shift. 

Admittedly, I had done a lot of work over the two years that separated the two jobs. Mental, emotional, etc. It's everything, all aspects. I worked really hard on creating a support network for myself, and I worked really hard (continue to) to improve my emotional literacy (have a hard time opening up, feelings, you know the drill).

47,"Yes and I never regretted it. You know how people say that the cycle of working is you get up, go to work, eat, sleep and then you do it all over again the next day? Well that’s how it was when I worked for a fedex warehouse. I actually didn’t have time for anything else apart from eat and sleep when I did work because I would be to exhausted to do anything else. The only thing that was keeping me going was the pay but that was when I found out for myself that pay does not equal me horrible every day because my body just wasn’t built for it. It also didn’t help that I was in the middle of nowhere and I don’t like that since the only way I could come home and back is via an hour long bus ride or a 30 dollar Uber so yea I say it’s worth your mental health",Charming_Course_1923,x1g2q7

73,"I got fired from a job for ""too many unexcused absences"" when I was going to the doctor. My fmla request mysteriously got denied and all of my appointments counted against me. 

I lost my hearing in my right ear, was diagnosed with a Functional Neurological Disorder AND found out I was diabetic all within 2 months. I have anxiety (among other things) that messed with my digestive system. 

That job asked me to work when I had Covid. They didn't want me to take time off when I randomly lost my hearing (I worked at a call center, hearing is kind of important) and they accused me of creating a 'hostile work environment' when I was sarcastic. 

They always assumed the worst in me. I was leaving a Slack channel unattended and posted a gif of salt while typing N/A for coverage.  I posted salt because it's NA on the periodic table. Rather than ask me about it they assumed I posted it because I was mad that there wasn't a higher up to man the channel. 

They made you stay late all of the time, had a mandatory work trip I wasn't allowed to bring my ESA on AND threatened to fire me for taking too long on breaks. 

Did they care that my OCD was making me late from breaks? No. Did it matter to them that I was having panic attacks in the office during my breaks? No. I have stomach issues partially triggered by anxiety and I eventually stopped eating during the work day because I couldn't take a needed bathroom break to throw up between calls. I told my boss about it, hoping for some reassurance or information about an accommodation and she just laughed at me. 

Getting fired sucked but not working at that place has done wonders for my mental health.  Losing my health insurance when I needed it the most was a kick in the teeth but overall I'm kind of relieved. I went from having panic attacks at work twice a month to one or two in the 15 months I've started my new job. 

Don't work somewhere that treats you like garbage. Don't work for a company that isn't willing to make accommodations. Don't work for a shitty employer like I did.",mightyhorrorshow,x1g2q7

They were a part of my sinking depression because they didn‘t understood my other mental illnesses like my ADHD so I was struggling with learning things. They always yelled at me, compared me to other woman in this job since it was a man‘s job they said. Yelled at my face for everything, when they were frustrated at me etc. Since then I am really scared of beginning another apprenticeship because I fear of experiencing the same thing.

It made me feel worthless and impacted everything. I remember driving home one night and thinking whats the point and lookijg at the very tempting oncoming traffic, I handed in my notice without a new job or any plan the next day (it was a 3 month notice period). while I was working my notice I went to the doctor about a different issue and ended up coming out with 2 months of sick leave (and antidepressants) my employer refused to pay my sick leave (illegal in my country but it was too much effort to take them to court) ended up moving back home with my parents.

I had multiple panic attacks every day. There was even a ""crying bathroom"" where me and others went to when needed. Towards the end, I had a mental breakdown. Their response was to lower my income by £5k. But I had all my friends there, and I was really happy there at the beginning, and it was really hard to let go as I was hoping the good times would come back. 

I still find it hard to believe I let myself be treated like that for nothing. It was very damaging and the following year and a half I would have related nightmares weekly, along with a random panic attack when I remembered some stuff. Took a long time to recover.

Said co worker is early 20's and the mother was terminally ill. I had no sympathy for the heartless twat when his own father died of old age and he was a sobbing mess who took the day off. He threatened to sack me for asking if he had any extra tasks to do on one of my days in as a 'show of incompetence' by showing i was willing to do more.

I just know I finally gave up caring in a sense. It definitely wasn't helping my mental health. I try to be nice to every person I come into contact with.

8,"I thought you might be interested in this.  If you go to the Amazon ad for You Are Not Your Brain by psychiatrist Jeffrey Schwartz, you'll see that people with OCD think very highly of this book. You can also hear the testimonials of readers on YouTube.

As this article shows, Dr Schwartz developed a therapy for OCD that has been validated with brain scan studies.

[https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/rewiring-the-brain-to-treat-ocd](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/rewiring-the-brain-to-treat-ocd)

Dr Schwartz says that OCD can be treated with these four steps: 

1) Relabel the obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges as obsessions and compulsions, not as real thoughts. 

2) Reattribute the obsessive thoughts to a brain malfunction called OCD. 

3) Refocus on a wholesome, productive activity for at least fifteen minutes. 

4) Revalue the entire obsession and compulsion group as having no useful meaning in your life. 

He's one of the many mental health professionals who believe in mindfulness. If you're interested, this has info on learning mindfulness, also some other things that can help with anxiety and depression.

That being said I know that sucks, I've been there so many times before. The best way is to keep doing what you're doing and challenge those beliefs/thoughts. Put yourself in those situations and expose yourself to feeling uncomfortable. Talk to friends about it.

If you're not, therapy can help a ton with this. CBT and doing exposure therapy for things like this can honestly change your life in months. Or years, no race.

I feel you though. I dropped out at 19 because of depression, took me 6 years to graduate, and I'm almost 30 and still deal with anxiety and depression. The biggest thing I wish I did differently was more CBT/exposure therapy. My avoidance these past 10 years has helped in the short term but made my anxiety worse in the long run.

22,"It might be a privilege. But it's not always going to be solely good. I can imagine being stable might have disadvantages. For example lack of understanding or insight in certain aspects, like mental health. They might not have to do the research we do about the mind and thus not get that knowledge that we will get.

I can imagine because of your issues you would be inclined to see and understand suffering and how we all create more of it. I can imagine that since you understand this kind of suffering, that either in your job or in the voting booth or in daily life. Any chance you get thrown at you. You'll probably have the insight or at least the drive to relieve suffering if the time comes isn't it?

At the same time, being unable to reconcile two contradictory beliefs isn't a stable state to be in. A lot of people have their fight or flight response kick in when someone disagrees with them.

I’m talking about hallucinations dizziness blurry vision light headed all at once I don’t even remember how I got home that night.

But they where very strong pills for the panic attacks I stopped as soon as I could because that’s the only effect they had when mixed with alcohol otherwise they didn’t help with the panic attacks at all.",CautiousCat276,1bqzhol

4,"Actually now you got me thinking 

I have the example of my adhd medication 

Since its amphetamine and people usually get high from it can hyper focus etc but people with adhd including me do literally not get high at all we just can do our tasks without hyper focusing soo the exact opposite of what people without adhd experience.

So since amphetamine alcohol and weed are all drugs it makes sense we behave differently like someone without it!",CautiousCat276,1bqzhol

7,">VERY IMPORTANT. Only drink and do drugs if you're in a good mental condition. Don't drink or use drugs as an escape mechanism. Your tolerance might be higher than other people, so practice restraint. If you're in the early stages of medication, i strongly advise against doing either.

I definitely understand. I've been on meds for a while now and it's definitely not a thing I'd overdo or stuff. I kind of just feel like it's an experience I'm locked out of if that makes sense, and I do want to experience what things I can in my life that won't cause serious damage, and (in moderation) I'd hoped these might be one of those things to catalogue and decide ""I enjoyed that"" or not, rather than yet another mystery of other people's lives I'll never get to understand.",SharpShogun,1bqzhol
8,"The thing is, I've tried a few different ADHD meds and even with Ritalin I felt literally no mental effects whatsoever, not even anxiety, just physical jitters and a thudding heart.

Some other days i do mushrooms or ecstasy and I'm like ""well that was a dud"" cause i felt nothing. (I ""recommend taking 2 month breaks between doing harder stuff like x or shrooms)

Men seem to be expected to be more manly, even less emotional. But, more men are ending up alone because those aren't things women are looking for anymore, and they're having more trouble making male friends.

And it's the man who is pig headed in his ways, and believes it's only his way, or the highway. Regardless of outward influence. ( We need to remember anger is an emotion just like sadness, and when uncontrolled is just as self destructive )  The unreasonable man.

14,"For your question i also suggest to ask on self improvement sub. There seem to be more professional answers. Maybe you can ask how could you deal with this and thoughts of invalid mental health issues. Basically to improve your view on the subject.

Here is my take (with similar experience): Your issues or feelings and problems are valid. There doesnt have to be a clear trauma. Trauma response can be also from cumulative happenings. I personally have everything good but still battle with mental health issues for over ten years with different problem behaviours. Even though its good or helpful to know reason why, it's not a necessity always. If you feel your life is good otherwise, but battle with certain problem behaviour its possible to just work on that and how to control the issue. Sometimes cause is not necessary to be known to deal with an mental health issue. 

You can self reflect ofc and in therapy to work that if there is some issues you think are small but have big effect. You can also just keep living normally, but work on the problem behaviour. There is nothing wrong with you by having even serious mental health issues with out trauma. I know that thought process, kind of a ""but why""  because i have it too. I just needed to accept it as being so. I dont agree with it but accept it as being the case.

There are possibility of that physically in our brains some problem that generate certain behaviours and those should be checked too. It can be chemical or physiological. Medications can example help, but i think you are familiar with this already.",Tulired,197uh4a

We’ve concluded that it comes from genetics, or something serious happened that she can’t remember/she never/hasn’t told us. Unfortunately a lot of the time it’s just genetics or repressed memories. Have you spoken to a psychiatrist? I know a lot of people don’t like medication but god it helps when you find the right one. I’ve been through significant trauma and I can say the medication definitely helps with the outbursts and negative feelings.

Sometimes it feels easier (albeit confusing) to say “nothing bad happened to me” because confronting or even remembering what happened could be potentially overwhelming. We humans really good at minimising things. I can’t imagine that you’d want to kill your self repeatedly if things inside of your mind felt comfortable and knowable.

It's really not wise to invalidate your feelings because there are things that could have happened that you would not have remembered that may have affected you. It's also possible that experiencing the emotions of other people could have some effect on you as well. I think a good start would be to start naming the emotions that you're feeling anytime that you are feeling depressed and suicidal. If you have to write them down in a journal, then absolutely do so because it will help you to think about the things that you are experiencing.

In addition, it's also important to understand that we all experience life differently from each other. What is traumatic for 1 person may not be traumatic for another. Or a different person may be able to handle that trauma differently than yourself.

From what you told -

- talking to oneself, it's not so unusual, some people develop habit of talking to oneself, sometimes just to not feel lonely, sometimes to make better choices,  sometimes when they are going through stuff

- making about herself, she is probably sensitive and developed a lifestyle that is surrounded by her problems and she hates living it but she can't find a way to break out of it and make a new life but she still talks about it, as that's all she knows and it hurts her all the time

- cries for no reason, that's extremely insensitive to say, because you can't know how she is feeling, idk what she is crying about but she must in emotional pain or crisis as when we are in extreme level of pain or stress, we cry and it releases chemical to calm us down

- anger, it's not an excuse but when you're going through such terrible life situation, you don't have much patience, you can say it's like a water drop in the filled glass, you know how you have a bad day and it's easier to get angry? Well having bad life (or feeling terrible everyday) makes you that way, ps you can only feel sadness and anger when all of your other emotions are shut down

If you actually were a mental health professional, you wouldn’t entertain OP’s ignorance. You’d educate them as well.

68,"If you want insight into mental health then go to a mental health forum or go to Google and look up patient information on mental illness, look at the diagnostic and statistical manual for mental health, look at the ICD 10, read some psychiatry journals, read a book by a credited source, hell even watch a YouTube video from a psychiatrist. All of those are appropriate ways to find out about mental health. Asking about someone in particular, asking with information that’s out of date, information that’s not actually descriptive or indicative of any mental illness, and is about someone you don’t even know anymore; those are all dangerous and bad ways to go about getting information. 

But I’m general, with anyone, weather they are someone you know or not, trying to find out what mental health problems someone has by using the Internet instead of trained professionals is dangerous. And no it doesn’t matter that no one cares about that girl, and no it doesn’t matter that she doesn’t want help, it still doesn’t give you any reason or right to be asking to try and find out what may or may not have been any problems she may have had.

69,"There really is no amount of ‘detail’ a non-impartial third party could give, even to an actual trained psychiatrist, that would be adequate for them to ‘guess’ what was going on for her. 
You really, really need to forget about this and focus on you. What you’ve described may be signs of a mental illness but your behaviour and, dare I say obsession with her looks/her family/ people not condemning her/whatever else, is the more concerning thing here. 
I can see that you’re very locked onto this and are unlikely to consider any of the constructive advice people are giving you. 
I truly hope you are one day able to. Until then I hope you don’t drive yourself too crazy.",,oaeqbb
70,"Because I am genuinely concerned this aspect of you makes you dangerous I’m going to explain it. 

Asking a question does not make you dangerous. 

Here’s an example of what an appropriate mental health question looks like: 

“Hi guys, I’m interested in learning about mental health and mental illnesses. Please could professionals and people who’ve experienced mental health issues tell me a little bit about it or important information they think people should know?” 

That’s an appropriate question for someone interested in learning about psychiatry. 

What you’ve done is give a list of character traits and behaviours that a woman you knew 8 years ago had, and have asked for “educated guesses” with regards to what might have been wrong with her. 

Absolutely none of that is ok. Because even though it’s anonymous, you have broken a personal trust of very private information that is riddled with insinuations about someone’s mental health. 

The information is not in anyway descriptive of anything related to mental health, because you don’t know about mental health or illness and therefore don’t know any of the real symptoms and signs to look out for, and you do not possess a significant psychiatric vocabulary to accurately describe someone’s mental state, which is much more complicated than the things you listed. 

No one,  not even the best and most brilliant psychiatrist in the world could ever give you any true information about this woman with the paragraph that describes how she was 8 years ago. It literally means less than nothing. For that reason any and all advice is untrue and wrong. Wrong information is dangerous, especially medical information that wrong. And psychiatry counts as medicine. 

If you give out bad information in mental health someone who is already unstable, or in crisis or at an incredibly low point or psychotic reads bad information and they then may act upon that, weather that’s dismissing they’re real diagnosis, refusing help, believing they have a mental illness they don’t, or killing themselves all these things can happen. When information is either wrong or presented poorly in mental health it is exceeding dangerous.

I will give you an easy example. On a medical drama (Holby city) years ago they showed a woman overdosing on paracetamol bought from the chemist as part of the soap. Immediately after that people started buying paracetamol from the chemist and taking overdoses. All because they got the idea from the TVs.

Newspaper media’s have incredibly strict rules on what they are and are not allowed to publish, particularly in relation to suicide but also in relation to all other mental health, because even the media accepts that information that is wrong can be seriously damaging. 

Another better example closer to home is that, as I’ve said repeatedly, professionals are not allowed to diagnose people over the Internet, and especially not like this. It is literally illegal. And as I’ve said “educated guesses” do NOT exist in mental health. So really you have nothing to ask. 

Finally, there is no point having concern over a woman’s mental health you knew 8 years ago, especially if you have no plans on contacting her. That just means your asking intrusive and personal information about someone you no longer know or have contact with, it borders on stalking behaviour. The person you knew 8 years ago no longer exists, she will be a different person. Partly because of life experience and partly because of growth and change, there is no possible way she is the same person and there is no way anything you’ve raised has any relevance today. 


You CAN have an interest and curiosity about mental health. 

You CAN learn about mental health and illness. 

you CAN ask questions about mental health and illness 

you CAN think about an ex girlfriend you knew 8 years ago 

You CAN wonder how she is doing

Idk your situation, but I assume there are ways you can remove yourself from her life. You don’t need to look out for her or her mental health.

EDIT

 When we're depressed, motivation for our chores and self-care can be very helpful. It gives us confidence. Activity, especially physical activity, is a kind of therapy. That's not all there is to getting over depression, but it can be very important.

I know that getting professional help can be hard. I'll say more about that.

Practical advice for motivation - VERY important -

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj70w9ZbZng&t=568s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj70w9ZbZng&t=568s)

Treatment often begins by seeing the family doctor, who can give you a referral. I mention referral because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you'd want to tell the doctor include how you feel at different times of day, any symptoms you might have such as change in appetite or sleep, and things in your life affecting how you feel.

The lockdown has changed the therapy situation. You may want to look at online therapy and self-help. Healthline, a site I rely on for good information, has an article that rates online services.

Some places have free therapy. A doctor or social worker may be able to help you with a search for therapy.

If you're depressed, I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.

People in various countries say that they can often find the books I mention in my comments with Amazon, Kindle, or Google Books.

If you go to Metapsychology, you can read a psychologist's review of Dr Steve Ilardi's book (""a splendid book""). He's the therapist and researcher who headed the Univ of Kansas lifestyle-depression project.

Relaxation eases the symptoms of depression.

The easiest way to calm down is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min in the early morning and at bedtime is a therapy. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently through the nose, 6 seconds each.

A good habit - respond to moments of stress by breathing slowly.

This is one of the articles online with advice for therapeutic comfort -

It may seem like it has nothing to do with it, but it had that feeling with games. When I finally managed to build a computer powerful enough to play the games I wanted, within a few days I completely lost interest in playing them. And then, I would go back to playing the old games, which at the time were so fun for me, and now they weren't anymore. The gamer PC crisis.

Well, I solved that, with a tip from a YouTube video, which applies to your case as well: Force yourself to finish everything you start.

Got an idea, a new interest? So focus on that, and go until the end. Don't try to do 2, 3, 4 things at the same time. Don't have an interest and halfway through, lose it and jump to another, and then lose interest in that other one too, and go to a third: You will only accumulate a pile of things and incomplete ideas.

In my case, I currently have 3 book ideas to write. I have a serious problem with procrestination, and knowing this, I forced myself to start writing, even though my brain punishes me by making me want to do something else all the time, or jump to the 2nd story before I finish writing the first.

It's a struggle, but I've committed to starting writing this first story, a little bit every day, and I won't stop until I finish it. And only when I finish this story will I start the next one.

Our modern lifestyle is destroying our ability to maintain dedicated focus on one thing for hours, days or weeks. We always want to do several things at the same time, always quick, short and pasteurized things. Anything that is complex, that requires effort, patience and a long period of dedication, gives you a headache just thinking about it.

But we have to fight it, force our brain to stay focused. Therefore, the tip of forcing yourself when you start doing something new, go all the way, and if that thing requires time, effort and long-term dedication, then focus on that one thing, until you finish, and only then, move on. the next idea.

In short, that's it: When you start something, go to the end, and dedicate yourself exclusively to that.",rapid_rodrigo,1aucby8

14,"I disagree that it's simple, or that it's the root. Charles Eisenstein and Rhyd Wildermuth have some good information on some of the deeper causes of our society's ills. 

As far as the specific issues relating to men, a large part of it is lack of healthy male rites of passage and models for healthy and balanced masculinity, as well as internalized shame for being male. Unhealthy norms lead us to repressing our emotions and not seeking help, and often make us feel not good enough as men. 

Then there is the issue of a deeply flawed mental health system that usually only focuses on medicating problems (which can lead to more repression for some) and/or talking it out over a lengthy period of time, which a lot of men either aren't used to or just don't benefit enough from - especially if there is trauma, as talk therapy can sometimes reinforce the trauma instead of reprocessing it. The mental health system also has a tendency to be patronizing. Innovations and reform in it will help everyone.

And another serious consideration that is overlooked is the average testosterone rates among men have decreased by 50%. That is a massive blow, which can have major impacts on a man's mental health and wellbeing.",,170h7ht

A good step would be to get a therapist. They're great at helping you along the journey of self-improvement.

Another first step is to write a list of all the things you don't like about your life and then next to it one small thing you can do to change it. Think small though. For example, if one of those things was loneliness look for weekly or monthly social gatherings in your area and go to them. There's a good chance your loneliness would start to dissipate before you realize it, even if all you're doing is making smalltalk.",Hexent_Armana,1c4nq3i
1,"First thing is making yourself a priority my guy. You've already learned just hitting the gym isn't enough, this is a good step.


What I mean is you need to dedicate time to yourself as though it were a person you prioritise. For example, if I make a plan with myself (note I didn't say _by_ myself) I won't overwrite those plans with someone else's invitation. It's the same as if I had plans with a friend or a date or something, I'm not rearranging them to hang with someone else unless it's an emergency.


Next, there's a hard realisation that we won't ever be someone's top priority in all situations. It's just not feasible. Even a future wife. At times she will prioritise you, but she also needs to be able to focus on herself, children if you have them, her parents, her friends. Priority is a transient thing. 


I'd be hard pressed to say I'm anyone's #1 priority right now. However I know that in a pinch I have a number of friends who'd step up and help me. And the same is true the other way around. 


I hold the belief that if I can do something, then generally speaking anybody can do it. I'm not particularly talented, or unique. I'm not naturally athletic but with training I got decently strong for my body weight, I was able to run over half a marathon distance. Now, think about your achievements and accomplishments, and how other people who approached it in the same way as you could achieve those things too.


This also applies for relationships. This means, if you can like yourself, others can like you too (not that everyone will, just that someone can). This means if you can prioritise yourself, other people can prioritise you too. We can repeat affirmations all we want, but sometimes we need evidence, and this is evidence of the possibility. Remember that we're just people, what we're capable of, so is everyone else. 


This doesn't mean you have to start loving yourself 100% right now otherwise it's a lost cause. Start small. If you can buy yourself a nice little coffee and a pastry, and enjoy an afternoon in the park with yourself, that means that someone else would also be happy to enjoy an afternoon in the park with you. If you can notice the things you love and appreciate about yourself amongst your perceived flaws, someone else can see those things too.",videogamesarewack,1c4nq3i

During that age, we barely just jumped into adulthood and are just about to figure things in life and ourself while possibly building the life around us (like, careers, relationships, house, investment, kids etc. If those are your things anyway). And important things take a lot of effort. 

I guess the thing is that things change. Some things may sound on paper a good idea, but might not work afterall. And having to find alternative can be stressful time and have a some sort of mourning period for example you have to change carees from a field you studied years for. Not an easy desicion to make, but you will only truly know after you’ve done it.

A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly.

I guess the standard minimum wage on 30 hours should cover a 1 br apartment (so single people can get by without needing multiple jobs, and getting married etc. is purely a bonus. Roommates and partnerships wouldn't be about survival).

Or... I had this wild thought awhile ago, and I like it, but I'm not sure how it would work. Maybe there's just no distinction between PT and FT anymore. You have a job, you're good. Really wild thought. I think this would require a MASSIVE overhaul and I'm not even sure it's possible.

I think rent prices should be tackled before even shortening the work week. It is abhorrent to me that people with very good jobs are struggling to afford tiny apartments.
