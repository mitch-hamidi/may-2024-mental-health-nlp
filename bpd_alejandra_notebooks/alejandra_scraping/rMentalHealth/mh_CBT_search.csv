0,I'm sick of therapists using CBT where it isn't helpful,"I'm getting really sick of people who are all about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Positive Psychology and think having a positive attitude is the end all be all of mental health treatment. There are many people who benefit from this type of therapy, don't get me wrong, but the people who are suffering most often see it as writing them off. If you are deep in poverty, in an abusive relationship, jobless, homeless, or preoccupied with messages from voices you hear, these methods do not work. Therapists need to take this into account when working with people who fit into these categories, but also initially with all patients. There should be an understanding that people aren't very open at first in therapy in general and could have any of these things going on and not tell you. Simply saying you need to change your thoughts doesn't work. People may be in situations where their thoughts are about real problems they need to face every day. I understand trying to make it easier for that person and that is what you think you're doing, but really you are just making your job easier. You, as a therapist, would be much better off starting with asking what kind of therapy someone is looking for and describing the different forms if necessary. Different forms fit different people and I'm sick of CBT being the gold standard. 

It really makes my blood boil when I hear someone say their therapist doesn't listen, and most of the time it's because they are trying to use CBT and Positive Psychology where they don't belong. Sometimes life really is hard for that person, and trying to get them to think differently about it is an exercise in futility. People are often quietly in crisis, and I see these approaches as inherently dismissive of this fact. 

I hope someone sees this and knows they can advocate to their therapist for something different, because I have had to multiple times and it is not easy.",1623329096.0,False,464,123,runclevergirl4444,None,nwmpz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/nwmpz1/im_sick_of_therapists_using_cbt_where_it_isnt/
1,I think I've had it with CBT,"Had a frustrating session with my CBT therapist yesterday, and I think, on balance, CBT is starting to (or already has been) do harm to me.

I was in a rotten mood, partially due to a plethora of medications I'm taking for chronic health issues, as well as my own anxiety/depression, and I was subconsciously dreading the session all day. And then comes the session, and it's just the same ""how do we avoid getting into this rut?"" ""how do we challenge ourselves?"" ""let's stop ourselves from getting into this spiral.""

It's so predictable, reductive, and formulaic, and ultimately it's also *un-fucking-falsifiable.* 

CBT seems to never officially ""fail."" If you're still depressed/anxious despite doing all your breathing exercises, body scans, CBT-I, reframing etc, it's not because CBT isn't working, it's because you're failing in some way to effectively implement these skills, according to my experience so far.

""I'm depressed.""

""Do your CBT.""

""I do hours of CBT daily, I'm still depressed.""

""Well, be better at CBT""

Maybe my problem isn't CBT, but dyed-in-the-wool CBT therapists, which mine definitely is. And her brain seems to shut off when we hit a wall that suggests that *maybe* CBT techniques aren't the answer to everything.

Frankly, I do think a lot of the cliches are true. CBT is invalidating as fuck, it's inherently confrontational, it starts off with the assumption that you are maladaptively coping and this is the primary source of your malaise.

And this maybe is more a me thing, but I can't deal with anything that doesn't allow negativity, and CBT seems to fit this bill. Anything, whether it's a person, a philosophy on life, a therapy, etc. that has this ""no negativity allowed, only positivity"" vibe to it just pisses me off, because it's dishonest. Some shit sucks ass, and it's also *possible* that some shit is unfixable. I'm not saying I am unfixable or that there's no hope, *but it's possible* that the worst possible outcome, and most sub-optimal state of affairs could be true; CBT effectiveley just says you're wrong for taking any empirical stance on that and need to just force yourself to believe that can't possibly be true.

4,Help finding appropriate therapy/Alternatives to CBT?,"Hello All. First time poster to this sub. I‚Äôm writing in about one of my best friends (Markus) he‚Äôs in his early 20s and has anxiety, depression and BPD. We  went to the same school but I was a couple years older than him, we became friends initially through extracurriculars and because I have a similar diagnosis so we understood each other and got close very quickly. While we have a lot in common, the area we differ is how we deal with our conditions. 

I have been seeing the same therapist for almost 5 years now. She‚Äôs very easy to talk to and has helped me so much through our time together. Markus has previously tried CBT with a therapist when he was around 16/17 for 6 months and he felt as though it didn‚Äôt work for him, he says he felt judged by his therapist and found it extremely difficult to know what to talk about in sessions. 

I tried to explain to him that therapy is a long process and it took me nearly 2 years before I started knowing ‚Äúhow to talk‚Äù in a therapy session in a way that allowed for constructive solutions and development. I also tried to explain that it often takes going to several different therapists over the course of a few years before finding one who you like and stick with. 

Markus is extremely intelligent, he was always one of the smartest kids at school, and has even been pretty close to top of his classes while at University. He‚Äôs an incredibly capable and highly logical person, except when it comes to addressing his mental health and emotional well-being (you can blame his childhood situation for this).

He‚Äôs adamant that CBT doesn‚Äôt work for him and is not eager to try it again despite it having been a while since he last did, but I‚Äôve known him for a very long time and I know he‚Äôs been going through a hard time recently and it‚Äôs been worrying as he has previously ended up putting himself in danger due to not addressing his emotional state. We see each other only about once a week but we text and call to catch up more often, he regularly talks about wanting to get professional help but never actually follows it through.

*TLDR*: My best friend needs mental health support but hasn‚Äôt had a good experience previously with CBT. What are some alternatives I could suggest he looks into? Alternatively how do I help him feel as though it might be worth trying again?",1708872168.0,False,2,2,Impossible_Yak2059,None,1azphl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1azphl5/help_finding_appropriate_therapyalternatives_to/
5,Experience with CBT and hypnotherapy?,"Hi,
My boyfriend, 24 M from India, is managing high levels of anxiety for the past 2 years.
Mostly arising from family pressure, self expectations, and managing job while preparing for a difficult exam. All this combined has led to low levels of self confidence, getting very anxious very easily, this impacts his exam preparation, which then again creates anxiety. Sort of like a loop.
He tried talking to a therapist virtually, she suggests taking it forward with 
Cognitive Hypnotic Therapy and CBT.

My therapist loves things like behavioural activation but the things I schedule in are just things I was going to do anyway and I‚Äôve even said that to my therapist.

We don‚Äôt go deep into my issues, we just skim over them and the whole session just feels like a game where I have to say the right answer like when I have a thought ‚ÄúI have a failed broken life,‚Äù my therapist asks me what I can do to challenge the thought and the correct answer is ‚Äúto do a cognitive reframe‚Äù but I don‚Äôt believe in the reframe. ‚ÄúI have a failed broken life‚Äù is just the truth of my situation. I don‚Äôt have the life I want and never will do.

7,Tips for when CBT fails?,"Recently, I'm finding that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy doesn't always work and, probably, is starting to work less and less for me.

It really helped at the begining to help me become aware of what I was feeling and break out of a vicious cycle. However, recently, it's as if there's a disconnect between what I'm aware of and how my body behaves.

For example, if I'm catastrophising, I'll be aware that I am and that it's irrational, using CBT methods to try and break out of the cycle, but I'll also be aware that it _could_ happen under some circumstances and therefore I'll continue to obsess. Yet, I'll also be aware of that too, try to break out, realise there's a chance, etc and enter this new loop.

Partially, I think my motivation to continue is extremely thin on the ground. With everything going on in the world, I find it harder and harder to even try CBT, care about whether it would work or believe what I tell myself to break out of vicious cycles.

10,therapy issues and cbt/dbt technique,"Please refer me to another thread if this is not the correct sub. I hope my post make sense . F late 20s here. I am sorry in advance for the very long rant.

in my opinion my current therapist is the best I ever had thus far . I am planning on working through my personallity diagnois , but I need to double check that she is 100% knowledagable on DBT. Also, she use to be an addiction couselor , but I do not understand how that is the case because she just tells me to attend meetings ( reachout , 12 steps and find a sponser). I feel like it not for everyone... In addition, I struggle with trichtilomania as well. we have been over the basic coping skills ,but nothing really helps . 

 I obviously relized that I have to put in the work too and continue to take my medications.  My freind (had bpd) recently mentioned the idea of switching therapist.  I have a lot to think about and at this point I am just making my owns notes of coping skills and googling reading material to learn more about how to help myself with these  multiple disorders.  I do not mind putting in the extra work , but it is very exhausting mentally.  I heard that CBT technique is  great for people whom struggle with addiction and Trichtilomania.  I was wondering if has that been the case for anyone else? 

 I am planning to dicuss this all with my therapist in my next apt .So i can figure out if i need to change therapist of not. For context My therapist always tell me that  she is not usually offended and i should not worry about hurting her feelings. If I am rude in anyway she calls me out for it which I do appreciate .  FYI This situation is now the 2nd time that I messed up boundaries. Anyways , My upcoming apt is in the new year and we had our weekly apt before she went on holiday/trip. That night I was organizing my emails / notes for my therapy sessions.  I accidently sent them to my therapist very late in the night. The email referenced referenced self harm , but no intent to harm myself at all. I had no idea i even sent to her until the next morning. I woke up to calls,emails and text ( phone was muted overnight). I called her right away that i was okay and I was sorry . She could not hang up fast enough which i do not blame her for ( she was leaving for her trip that day). my therapist then proceeded to send an email stating "" if it is not true emergency"" please do not reach out and gave me a crisis number etc. I just know when we have our apt that it be the first thing to dicuss. the worst part is that I spiraled and acutally ended self harming because of  how anxcious / guilty i felt. there were other reasons , but that was the main reason. I am not sure how to even explain this in a kind way. I am not blaming her , but it could come off mean.

18,How do you identify that CBT therapies aren't working for you ?,"Hello, I am from India, where mental health is a biggest taboo. Post Covid, things are slowly changing in urban cities \[especially in capital cities of states\].  
When I reached adulthood, I started to understand that there's some issue with me and things are not working like how it is working with others. I had lot of issues in mingling with people, socialising and finding peace within myself. So I started to try therapy. I am very happy that I chose therapy, instead of becoming very religiously conservative and bash the therapy.  
The first therapist I chose, was actually not a therapist but just a motivational speaker, which I failed to recognise in the early stages of therapy. Therapist used to share the screen and used to show some motivational videos. It was something similar to this : she showed Virat Kohli's picture and told ""See, Virat kohli is great cricketer. But he had lot of hurdles but he was successful in becoming strong. Why can't you just get motivated by him and be strong?"". So I realised it is not for me and changed the therapist.  
My second therapist is many times better than the first one. She has the art of listening. I have completed 7th session. First 5 sessions were about me explaining the issues with her. In the 7th session, she explained cognitive distortion and told how lot of my worries are because of it. I acknowledged that I will go through it and will try to apply it.  
It's been more than a week, and I am observing that cognitive distortion which is the core concept of CBT is doing more harm to me than being helpful. My mood is terrible from past 1 week. I had gone to a short family trip and even in that trip, but my mood was terrible. What have I found unhelpful is, CBT believes that we are the reasons for our sorrow. It is psychological version of stoicism. For example, ""All-or-none thinking"" is one of the cognitive distortion. And CBT says once you identify 'All-or-none thinking' and able to change that mood, your issues will be resolved. But CBT doesn't focus anything on the root cause that cognitive distortion. CBT doesn't give anything that says why do I think 'All-or-none' ? What has made me think like that ? etc.  
The ultimate soul of CBT is :  
""if you want to be better then just do the things you're unable to do"". But it is not helpful because there's strong reason why the thing is difficult for me and CBT doesnt help me to explore in that direction.  
So now question is :  
Does my explanation makes sense ? Or is it just my mind trying play a game with me and strongly convincing me that CBT doesn't help, because if I start applying CBT then my neural network will change and there will be lot of inertia in the beginning for the change ? I am confused. When is it possible to decide CBT is not for me ? I assume, even after 4-5 sessions of CBT if things are not getting better, then probably I will have to again change therapists ?  
But there comes another question, most of the therapists you find in country like India \[which is really backward country / a third world country\] are CBT therapists only. I tried hard to search for EMDR/DBT/TF-CBT/IFS therapists but unfortunately I am not able find anyone.

20,"How do you ""change thoughts"" in cbt?","Therapists have told me I need to change my thoughts so that will affect my behavior and feelings.

I acknowledge the fact that thoughts affect behavior and feelings.

But how can we change thoughts? I believe the only thing we have some control over is our actions.

I believe our thoughts are a somewhat predictable result from

1. memory
2. previous thoughts
3. information incoming through our senses
4. events happening around us
5. things that interest you

etc..

But I don't believe we can make a conscious decision to have certain thoughts. For some thoughts this is possible, I can tell myself to imagine a pink elephant.

But can I tell myself that right now there is a pink elephant in my room? My subconscious mind knows for sure that my conscious mind is lying. Therefore it does not get accepted.

If I tell myself, for no reason, that there is someone outside my house about to kill me. My subconscious mind knows I'm lying and because of that, my body does not react, I do not feel scared, because lying to myself like that is impossible. But if some information from outside of my mind comes in and gives me valid reasons to believe such a thing then my body will react with hormones, fear, emotions, action etc..

So when my therapist suggested me to tell myself ""I can do it"" what am I supposed to do with this advice? How do I convince my subconscious mind that I can really do it? When, I know very well that, the last year I have been extremely unproductive, and there is no reason tomorrow I would make better decisions than today

The twin demons of anxiety and depression are still there, and I don't think they will ever go away, but I think overall I am in a much better place now than I was before I started taking therapy sessions. Granted, in part this improvement may also be down to changing and improving life situations, but the CBT has at least allowed me to get a perspective on my headspace that I wasn't able to see before.

That being said, a number of people I know are not fans of CBT. This includes people who have been having to deal with trauma and PTSD, persons who have been bipolar and/or on the autism spectrum, and people like myself who have suffered from anxiety and depression. In all of these individual instances they have declared CBT to be inadequate to their mental health needs, but I don't think I recall specifically the reasons that they gave.

35,Psychodynamics vs CBT,"Has anyone noticed how Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and the Neurosciences are taking over our approach to the human mind?

They are part of us and we must learn to accept them and keep them in balance with our positive emotions. Why is it that thinking or being ""different"" is more and more considered to be ""dysfunctional""? I keep hearing about people getting drugged up or institutionalized just because they can't conform to what is being asked or rather demanded of them.

36,Recently started CBT. Therapist asked me about my goals and I'm confused.,"I recently started CBT. I was diagnosed with Body Dysmorphic Disorder by a psychiatrist (I also have Bipolar Disorder type II), and he recommended CBT for me.

During my first session, we went over my history and my therapist said she could tell I've worked really hard on accepting myself as I am, so she was curious as to what my goals were with CBT. 

I told her I would like to develop the skills to tolerate the comments and situations in my daily life that are related to my physical appearance (I'm someone who has to deal with nicknames at my workplace and negative comments by strangers regarding my looks), because I've reached a point where I'm completely tired of having to put up with them, because I can't escape them.

She stated that I wasn't specific enough and I needed to think of my goals and bring them up next time.

I'm confused as to what kind of language I should be using to describe my goals or if I'm confused as to how CBT can help me with that, so I'd appreciate if anyone who has gone through CBT can give me some advice as to how to formulate my goals. Maybe some examples? Any help is appreciated.

41,I start NHS CBT therapy this month‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm terrified.,"Hello. This is my first Reddit post so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm doing this right, but I would love to gather responses from anyone who‚Äôs willing and/or knowledgeable in the subject from their own experiences to help calm my nerves, or perhaps strengthen my current thoughts. It would mean the world to me, as I believe that I benefit from hearing other peoples personal stories and point of views. TW for talk about abusive parents ahead.

I‚Äôm a 23 year old female who grew up in a heavily abusive household; mentally, emotionally and physically. I‚Äôve suffered with anxiety for as long as I honestly remember, and now that I‚Äôm an adult it‚Äôs left me struggling with everyday life.

Thankfully, I recently moved out of that toxic household with my partner, that I‚Äôm ridiculously lucky to have because I never would have been able to move out of it wasn‚Äôt for them‚Äî I am unable to make my own money/hold a job, so I‚Äôm fully dependent on them and their help for the last few years. They‚Äôve been amazing, and because of them and my own home that I‚Äôm finally able to feel safe in, that feeling of safety for the first time in my life has given me the confidence to try to reach out for help in the form of self-referring therapy from the NHS.

I reached out around March, and after an hour long phone call with a woman and answering a ton of questions, she said to me that CBT was the form of therapy that they think is right for me, and that I‚Äôll be on a waiting list for a few months, and that my therapy will also be via video call.

Well, I was supposed to begin my treatment in September. However, I recently received a letter in the post that my treatment has now been moved to August, and that has caught me really off guard and skyrocketed my nerves. I‚Äôm constantly counting down the days and it‚Äôs making me feel nauseous every single day, every time that I think about it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs unbearable sometimes, especially before trying to sleep at night.

I know I should be thankful to be receiving any kind of therapy, and I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm sounding ungrateful. I was really optimistic at the time of making my phone call, but these last few months of waiting have ate away at my confidence with all the anticipation. That, and I‚Äôve researched more about CBT (which I had no idea about at the time) and have learned quite a handful of negative things about it. 

I‚Äôve heard that CBT is best for people who have intrusive thoughts due to depression, anxiety etc with //no// trauma... helping them sort those thoughts and clarify why they‚Äôre harmful and/or wrong. But CBT for people //with// trauma, is not so great. I‚Äôve even seen numerous people compare CBT therapy to gaslighting, and that it made them feel worse rather then better.

I know not everyone is going to have the same experiences, but I‚Äôve heard almost nothing positive about CBT for trauma victims and abuse survivors, especially via the NHS. I‚Äôm really, really worried that this form of therapy is going to make me feel worse, and the thought of feeling worse then I do now scares me so much. I want to be optimistic about therapy, I want to see if it‚Äôs something that‚Äôll work for me and to say that I‚Äôve tried it. But I‚Äôm so genuinely terrified because dealing with people is the one thing that stops me from seeking help in the first place‚Ä¶ I want to look at it as this being a first big step to try and adjust to communicating with people directly, and that if I make this step it‚Äôs only going to make future interactions easier. But that‚Äôs currently being overshadowed by all of the scary things I‚Äôve heard about CBT and the way it makes people feel.

I feel like I‚Äôm hardly making any sense. Hopefully I am? I think long story short is that my anxiety was born from abusive parents that have left me feeling so broken. I don‚Äôt know who else to talk to about this because I don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs been through anything similar. I thought for the longest time that it was normal to be harmed by your parents, and I‚Äôve felt so alone in all these feelings that I really want to try and get better now. I know a handful of therapy sessions won‚Äôt instantly ‚Äúcure‚Äù me, but is CBT fitting for someone who‚Äôs anxiety/PTSD is trauma related? 

I should also mention that the thought of a video call is absolutely nerve wracking is well. I have a lot of self confidence issues regarding my appearance, and I tell myself all of the time that no one cares what I look like, so a therapist definitely won‚Äôt care either. But to know someone‚Äôs eyes are going to be on me constantly and reading me is‚Äî yeah. A lot. Sigh. I feel like this is all doing me more harm then good‚Ä¶ and I wish I wasn‚Äôt thinking that way, but sometimes it‚Äôs unavoidable. Have you experienced video call therapy via the NHS? What was it like?

47,Would CBT still be helpful to me at this point?,"I went to therapy for depression and anxiety.

I've been to several therapists in my whole life. I assume that was psychodynamic therapy, because we were mostly analyzing my past experiences to understand my current negative emotions better. We would try to figure out what specificaly makes me anxious or depressed about this or that. I'm not saying it wasn't useful, but after 6 months of going to therapy regulary, I just seem to run out of things to say and generaly I start to feel lazy to go to the sessions. I made a conclusion that I just need to spend more time around people, because isolation is mainly what's causing most of my mental problems.

Even though I understand myself better at this momment, I still don't feel very free. I get panic attacks from time to time and I still think that anxiety is making me miss out on a lot of things. But I'm just so tired of analyzing what is going on in my head when I get anxious (which is what I would do at therapy). It feels pointless at this point. I do seem to understand why I'm getting anxiety. I just want to know what should I do once the anxiety comes. What should I do when I go out and that disgusting discomfort comes, what should I do when people are irritating me, what should I do when I get anxious before calling someone, how can I stop feeling anxious when talking to people etc. I did not get the answers for theese questions from my therapy.

What to do (suggestion): Pick out one or a number of statements to live by for each day and keep doing it until you build resiliency.

15 Strength-Building Self Statements

1. What‚Äôs the worst that can happen? And based on my experience, *not my emotion*, how likely is that to happen?
2. Feelings are sometimes painful, but are *time-limited*.
3. It will get easier every time I practice.
4. My success is measured by taking *skillful actions*, not by whether I was anxious when I did it.
5. I‚Äôm *not going to let* a lapse get in my way. I‚Äôm *going to continue making progress* towards my goal.
6. Feeling I *can‚Äôt* do it is **not the same as** not being *able* to do it.
7. Good job (me). I‚Äôm staying in this situation even if It‚Äôs hard.
8. I‚Äôm going to make it.
9. It‚Äôs a *sign of strength* to ask for help in an effective way, *not a commanding way*.
10. *Knowing when* to ask for coaching is a *skill* in itself.
11. I am a *unique person*, and I have a *unique reaction*. Only **I** can determine how I should feel in any given situation.
12. My feelings are *not* right or wrong, they just simply *are*.
13. Feelings of certainty are **not the same as** the truth.
14. My painful emotions *happen for a reason* and are an important *source* of information and direction for me.

69,CBT or electricity-based gadgets/therapies for automatic intrusive negative thoughts?,"Hi. I had a really demoralizing mental breakdown during nighttime. I've had more breakdowns and rough patches in the past year than ever before, but this was the first time that my swirling thoughts and feelings were concentrated on feeling worthless and such. I got really scared because usually it's ""just"" a jumble of thoughts, I can't really make out anything in particular, I ""just"" feel super overwhelmed. But now it really made me worry for my own mental health.

I've heard about therapies or methods where professionals use a form of electricity to somehow stimulate the brain and basically make anxiety and depression a lot better, more bearable. I did a quick research just now and found a product called Alpha-Stim which is a little device that does these electric waves(?) to help people shift their thoughts and get out of that super-hard-to-escape mental trap that the mind creates (which I described above). Probably there are opportunities where you can sit in in a controlled environment, like a hospital or something, and let professionals do this therapy or session for you, but having your own device with you does sound like a pretty good idea too.

So I wanted to ask this community if anyone has ever tried either Alpha-Stim or some other kind of treatment which includes electricity and waves in your brain. Did it help you? If so, how many sessions were needed before you felt a change? How regular and how long are the sessions? Is it a method that has an end, like a last session, or do you have to regularly do it for the rest of your life? If you feel comfortable with sharing the severeness of your mental state, that would help a lot too.

I will start therapy at a CBT centre next week, but after this incident today, I'm worried that only CBT might not work for me since sometimes I have really serious breakdowns. That's why I want to ask for the opinion and experience of people who did or currently are doing CBT to treat their depression and/or anxiety. If you have/had moderate or severe depression/anxiety and have/had trouble mostly with overwhelm and negative thoughts - how did/does CBT help you? How long did it take to have a positive effect on your thinking and mental state?

I think I need a combined therapy of some sort (either these 2 methods, or maybe CBT and medication) because even though my baseline mood and mental state are okay, I'm experiencing rougher and more mentally exhausting breakdowns when I do have them once or twice a month, usually. I really want to get better, but I have no idea what would work for me and what not, and I don't exactly have much money to try everything out...",1643270859.0,False,2,1,anxiety___throw,None,sdte4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/sdte4y/cbt_or_electricitybased_gadgetstherapies_for/

72,How CBT gaslit me into accepting abuse,"I feel like people have this picture of a therapist getting some sort of extreme picture up front and then rejecting it.  And I just don't get the sense that's realistic.  So I wanted to write out how for me it would actually happen, with how therapy encouraged me to see my inability to tolerate abuse as unreasonable and the behavior of an abusive parent as normal and healthy.

So a client might start to open up by saying something like ""my mother doesn't care what I have to say.""  The therapist is using CBT for anxiety and wants to help the client test that belief.  So they'll ask something like ""well, that's a fairly strong statement - are there any times you can remember where she has listened to you?""  The client thinks about it and can come up with a few times, and is then encouraged to reframe their belief in light of the new evidence, and in light of the worksheets talking about black and white thinking and how generalized statements are problematic.  The therapist then praises the client for coming to this realization and making progress.

This happens 2 or 3 times over different events.  And after a while of this, plus just of the baseline message that you're suffering from anxiety and the problem behind that is that you're viewing things that are worse than you are, you start doing it on your own.  This is also seen as progress - it's in fact what you're being encouraged to do.  From the therapist's perspective therapy is going well, you're learning to reframe things on your own and that's going to help you eventually conquer your anxiety.  And since you want therapy to be making progress, you're not going to keep bringing up a settled issue now that you know how to deal with it on your own.

(Side note here:  the idea of telling your therapist everything is nonsense.  It's not possible to tell someone everything in an hour a week.  What a client who wants to get better is going to do is try to bring up what's relevant and important.  If the client doesn't know on their own that something is relevant, or if the therapist indicates other things are more important, then it won't come up.)

The trouble is that many of these techniques work very effectively at reframing any situation that isn't cartoonishly black and white.  Most real-world situations, even genuinely bad ones, will have at least some evidence that they're not that bad after all.  Abusive relationships are especially bad because the abuser is usually trying to make their behavior seem plausible.  Part of the problem above is that finding that there *are* times she'd pay attention to what I said, would then be pushed to a very moderate statement like that I felt like she wasn't listening to me right now.  When the truth was more like that she had a consistent pattern of not caring about my thoughts or feelings interrupted with occasional small displays of support.

A lot the issue here is selective attention.  At least in reflecting on my own experience, there was a lot of bias slipping into the evidence itself.  It was supposed to be about making decisions based on the evidence rather than on feelings, but there was a bias towards searching out evidence that would lead to negative statements being false and positive statements being true.  And uncertain or unclear evidence - stuff that could be just emotional but could also be something - would especially tend to get dismissed if it was negative.

I've tried to ask actual therapists about this but never been able to get anything more than vague ""well obviously use common sense"" or ""well you don't want to use it on abuse cases"" answers or the like.  It doesn't seem like a very good technique to me if it relies on already knowing if a situation is genuinely bad or not to work?  But I really cant tell what's going wrong in a case like this - other than the fact that therapists were reading specifically trauma related symptoms as generalized anxiety.

86,Any tips for someone starting CBT?,"Hello everyone!

TL;DR does anyone have any tips on how I can prepare to make my CBT sessions successful? If you're in (or have been through) this process, what do you do that leads to helpful conversation?

Some context that became me venting is written below:

I just started CBT and I'm having a lot of trouble with it. Now, I've only had 2 sessions (but they're definitely not cheap, and my mental health is so poor I had to quit work) but I feel like they're not going productively enough for me to be OK with spending this much money on them. So far it's my therapist asking me questions and I can only respond ""I don't know"" or they point out thought distortions that I recognize are there, but we can't come up with believable thoughts to combat it.

I'm playing around with CBT apps to get an idea of how this is supposed to work, but I feel like I'm not getting it. I'm having trouble ""putting a voice to the negative thoughts"" because it's just all noise or random thoughts that I can't figure out (or can't really remember in reflection). I also realize there's no use worrying about 99% of the things I worry about, but the advice is always ""don't worry so much about that"" but if I don't worry or think about it, then I can't problem solve? Repressing things just doesn't seem healthy either.

I want this to stop and I want to be a functional human, but I feel like I'm seriously missing something. I know it's a therapist's job to guide me through this, but we're all only human and I'm a huge mess, so if there's anything I can do, I want to do it. Even they are a bit taken aback by how stressed I am and I'm holding back A LOT. Oof.

89,I don't understand how CBT is different from the gaslighting I've had all my life,"I've asked therapist after therapist after therapist questions like this and it's ALWAYS been dodged. Never gotten a straight answer, but I've been accused of being uncooperative or not wanting to get better a lot if I pushed.

CBT just sounds like what I've heard all my life to make me think I was crazy. My family was heavily abusive. But the message wasn't really ""you deserve this"", it was always ""this is what normal loving families are like and if you'd just accept that you'd be happy."" Like if I tried to call my mother out for saying something but acting in the opposite way, I'd get mocked for talking like I could just read her mind. Or if I tried to bring up a bad incident I'd be told that I was just focusing on the negative, there were all these nice things they did for me, why was I just insisting on being so black and white all the time?

When I've done CBT in the past, it just reinforced that message. I came in at a point where I was hurting and confused; I had a lot of strong emotions running through me that I didn't understand why I felt that way. When I couldn't adequately explain my feelings, the therapist would start talking about the CBT triangle and encourage me to look for the distortions. The truth was that my feelings were an accurate reflection of a reality that I'd been gaslight into not being consciously aware of.

I don't understand why it's somehow bad and abusive when my mother does it, but then ok when a therapist uses the exact same arguments.  And I don't understand how we can keep ethically practicing a therapy like this when there don't seem to be any safeguards that we're not just gaslighting a client because they can't explain all the evidence in the way we're looking for.  (I suspect a major issue in my case was that most of our society considers it ""unrealistic"" for a woman who acts like a caring mother to be abusive or predatory towards her daughter.)

There doesn't seem to be any real mechanism to CBT to tell what's a cognitive distortion and what's just a rational thought. Especially in cases where the person might not fully understand what's bringing them to that conclusion, or in cases where other people might want to push back on it. Am I missing something here? I know it's supposed to involve comparing your thoughts to reality, but whose view of reality do you use?  Because in practice the ""reality"" we're working with is heavily influenced by our society, personal biases, available information, and so forth.",1592327692.0,False,5,15,WarKittyKat,None,ha87mp,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ha87mp/i_dont_understand_how_cbt_is_different_from_the/
90,"My therapist is amazing, but I don‚Äôt know if CBT is right for me..","Background: I‚Äôm a 31 y/o F, separated (going through a divorce) with a 7 yr old son and currently staying with my parents. Finishing up my senior year of undergraduate studies in SLP, recently applied to grad school

I have mild cerebral palsy and have suffered from social anxiety for as long as I can remember, and have spend much of my life feeling depressed and having low self esteem.

My therapist practices cognitive-behavioral therapy, and it‚Äôs great to have someone to talk to who basically gives me unconditional positive regard and makes me feel heard

But I don‚Äôt know if this is the right approach to address the issues I face. I find that much of my depression/anxiety is sporadic/random.

Sometimes I‚Äôll feel incredibly down for no apparent reason and she‚Äôll ask me if I can remember having any thoughts or experiencing something that led to me feeling that way, and the truth is I don‚Äôt.

Same with my anxiety, there are times where I feel particularly anxious and she asks ‚Äúwhat was going through your mind when you started feeling anxious?‚Äù So I can challenge the negative thoughts, But I wasn‚Äôt really thinking anything.. it‚Äôs almost like an automatic/somatic response at this point.

I don‚Äôt know if I should continue with this therapist or search for someone different who uses a different approach. But I wouldn‚Äôt even know how to politely tell her, I really do enjoy talking to her but I don‚Äôt know how much progress I‚Äôve made in the past 2 years when it comes to my depression/anxiety.

98,How does CBT work for anxiety when there aren't any thoughts that come up?,"So I've been seeing a therapist for awhile now about my social anxiety, and she has been working with me on some CBT techniques for taking on anxious thoughts.

The problem is, when I have anxiety, I'm not really thinking anything specific.

It's not like ""They're going to judge me,"" but it's just the physical feelings that are automatic.

I freeze up, get awkward, shake, feel sick to my stomach, etc.

This can happen just from making eye contact with someone, so I usually just look down.

But no thoughts come up. Just an instant feeling of panic.

Can CBT help with this?

There are other times when I have been able to identify thoughts that may be causing my anxiety, but challenging them just feels like I'm lying to myself.

I could really use some help with what to try next if anyone has any advice.

I have been going to therapy every week for about eight months now, but I haven‚Äôt seen any improvement in myself since starting. Is this normal?

101,My pet peeve with CBT therapy,"Today, my sessions with my therapist, who I have been seeing for nearly two years, have ended. He told me he thought that I was done with therapy and believed I‚Äôd be fine without it. I strongly disagreed with him and still do. I‚Äôm now aware that many True CBT therapists do this. It is a time based type of therapy and it does not offer supportive care. In my eyes, it is a therapy based on getting themselves good results. Sure it can help in the short term and get people out of bad situations, but it is not designed for any form of relapse that might occur. 

My therapist has said I can return if another crisis occurs, but frankly, the trust has been broken and I‚Äôll likely never see him again. He also had to drop this little info on how he‚Äôd normally drop a client who refused to do the homework assigned in CBT, like I did, but saw I needed help. Which also irritated me very much. 

So to sum it up, CBT is too rigid and designed to post good results from their patients as opposed to truly letting the patient dictate when therapy should end. I will not be going back to a therapist who uses those practices again.

I decided talk therapy was doing nothing for me, as my anxiety has been getting steadily more debilitating and I've been realizing the extent to which I'm extremely limited by it compared to my peers, especially in my relationship. So I checked out a counsellor who referred me to a CBT group.

I want to be pro-active, but I have ZERO context for speaking in front of other people about my anxieties.

106,What are your experiences with CBT?,"Full disclosure: I think it's crap.

Let me clarify. I think there are seeds of truth within it. I was relentlessly bullied and somewhat abused as a child, and had to conscientiously re-train myself to overcome severe social anxiety and, to a lesser extent, OCD tendencies. It took a lot of effort and cost me about ten of the most important socially-formative years of my life (plus all that childhood nostalgia which I don't have). I'm still a bit ""weird"" in many ways, but in a pinch I can pass for someone who's highly sociable and charismatic, and even enjoy it from time to time!

However, being introduced to CBT many years later, it feels rather like a half-baked caricature of what I went through, both in terms of the problem and its solution. [Here's](http://www.theemotionmachine.com/cognitive-restructuring-complete-guide-reframe-beliefs/) a decent overview of what CBT represents and [Here's](http://www.specialtybehavioralhealth.com/wp-content/Common%20Unhealthy%20Thought%20Patterns.pdf) a list of ""common unhealthy thought patterns"".

*****

So the basic premise of CBT is that ""distorted thoughts"" are the root of mental illness, and it's further assumed that these thoughts take the form of an explicit internal narrative, like, ""*I failed; I'll always be a failure, and no-one will ever like me.*""

I call bullshit. Yes, these thoughts may occasionally happen, but for me they're, like, 10% of the experience. I'd guess they probably make up a good amount of what therapists hear in dealing with patients in distress because, *duh*‚Äî

‚ÄîIn general you're not going to get a lot of carefully-measured analyses from these people about their experience. Not when they're at their most desperate, and likely in an unfamiliar, uncomfortable environment (which therapy often is). THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THIS IS THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. It's a fucking symptom.

And that brings me onto my next gripe with CBT, which is that it's inherently a victim-blaming sort of philosophy.  One thing I noticed about the above-linked ""list of cognitive distortions"" is that it doesn't really correspond to any list of objective logical fallacies; it's something that can pretty much be applied to ANYONE who complains about anything. It's *super* easy for a therapist to find and label ""cognitive distortions"" in their patients, without needing to do any more work or provide any other insight.

Seriously, I suspect that this is probably the biggest reason why CBT is so popular‚Äîit's so very easy to deploy.

*****

But I digress. The biggest problem, I find, is that CBT simply doesn't cover very much of the experience. I've written extensively about ADHD and depression in the past. For one thing, there's the existential angst that comes from not being able to rely on satisfaction from doing ""good"" things‚ÄîI can absolutely have a good workout, then meet a friend for coffee, and feel fucking *terrible* afterwards, meaning that it's a constant struggle to even keep that baseline going. I find both my curiosity and empathy waning, and have to consciously address each of them in turn to try to ""build myself up"" to a point where I feel somewhat engaged.

107,HOW I KILLED MOST OF MY ANXIETY with CBT and Paroxetine BUT STILL NEED HELP! Any psychiatrist out there?,"I ""HAD"" severe anxiety issues. Growing up my parents were particularly abusive. They had black and white thinking often shutting down my opinions if they contradicted their own. They would often yell at me, be hyper critical if I made a mistake, and gaslighting me. I was never physically hit but it always came close. The threat was there. I ran away from home 3x's. **Back then my anxiety/depression was at a constant 10/10 in 2014, spiking to 12 to 15/10 under various circumstances.**

**However**, through sheer grit and determination I applied CBT on myself in college in NYC. I constantly went out and talked to people and put myself in uncomfortable situations -- often getting rejected. I learned social cues and destroyed a lot of my preconceived notions about reality. I gained friends and had 2 girlfriends in the course of 4 years. **My anxiety was still at a constant 6/10, sometimes spiking to 8/10.** 

My studies suffered because I still experienced MASSIVE anxiety in my everyday life. I still couldn't sit down, focus, and read/write. The same things that scared me in the past still do but to a lesser degree. 

Fast Forward after a couple months trying to meditate and deal with things organically **I was given paroxetine 25 mg by my psychiatrist.**  It has changed my life, helping me focus on my job as a Software Engineer, form better relationships with friends and parents\*. **My anxiety is at constant 0/10**. **Sometimes spiking to a 2-3/10**. I'm a normal fukkin person now. 

**HOWEVER** sometimes I experience periods of extreme anxiety bursting to an 6-8/10. I used to smoke a lot of **weed**. Like A LOT to curb my anxiety. I stopped 100% 1.5 yearS ago **BUT I still experience a placebo high when I smell it.** I feel slightly high even though I know I am not physically affected by THC. I think my serotonin levels temporarily increase. Then drop after not leaving my apartment and smelling weed. **That's when my anxiety boosts to a constant 4/10, spiking to a 6/10** and a lot of my fears and issues start bubbling back up.

So, We built Clear*Mind* with the intent of helping people get access to the techniques most CBT-certified therapists would use with their patients, in an approachable way over their smartphone. One simple change we made over other CBT apps is the ability to store and re-visit topics. It makes ""sessions"" which is the core exercise in the app feel more like a therapy journey rather than just journalling.

We also introduced Doc, a therapist character, we intend to give him live features like Smiling and Waving to make it feel welcoming and human. Ultimately, the goal here is you shouldn't need to pay high fees or wait weeks to get access to great quality help, if you're going through a hard time. Doc is always there to help and he's only a tap away!

118,Does anyone find CBT/DBT‚Äìtype therapy just... shallow and hard to identify with?,"For the **tl;dr** peeps: since long before being introduced to CBT, I've been TRYING to look for positive ""angles"" to motivate myself: I try to remember good experiences from the past, imagine incentives for the future, etc. to connect to the present; and though sometimes it works, I've also noticed that the longer it goes on, the HARDER it becomes...as the level of challenge rises, the ""angle"" I have to take becomes more far-fetched and convoluted, ever taking more energy to overcome the basic emotional/intuitive understanding that **there is something wrong here**:

The act of ""positive thinking"" itself has become poisoned, untrustworthy; my own voice gaslighting me, like an abusive partner, frequently telling me that, ""*no, this is OK. it's YOUR fault if you can't appreciate this.*""

*****

Quick diagnostic background, for context:

- Treatment-resistent depression/[cyclothymia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cyclothymia/symptoms-causes/syc-20371275)

- ADHD (*untreated till recently as an adult*)

- Had OCD has a child (*grew out of the worst symptoms, but I think possibly that just drove those habits ""underground"", so to speak*)

- Was previously treated for BPD (*based on emotional sensitivity/lack of regularity*), but don't relate AT ALL to many of the hallmark symptoms, e.g. [""splitting""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology), cutting, angry outbursts

- At least 8 years of childhood bullying/abuse, including being stalked home and having older children wait outside in the morning to harrass/beat me before class. These were pre-Columbine days when it was typical for adults to respond, ""*You have to stand up to them. They'll go away.*""

- Anxiety. That isn't an official diagnosis, but an obvious outcome of the above and massive problem in itself.

- Was tested for Asperger's with results just slightly off the Autism spectrum‚Äîan ""infrared Aspie"", if you will.

*****

If there's one thing I've learned, it's that psychological diagnoses are, at best, vague pigeonholes based on symptomatic expression, meant to expedite the identification of an effective treatment for as many people as possible. That's fine.

Yet, roughly 80-85% of the professionals I've met with have had some sort of CBT/DBT agenda (for lack of a better word) upon meeting them. You know: ""*change your thoughts*"", ""*you can do it!*"", ""*it's important to learn* **skills**"", etc.

I'd go so far as to say that it's become an ideology in that field. An absolute truth.

...

‚ÄîLook, I *get it*, okay? This is a big thing they seem to be missing: not everyone with a mental illness is new to these ways of thinking. The ""self-help movement"" is as old as the printing press‚Ä†; we're NOT all of us incapable of realising on on our own basic ideas like, ""*your emotions affect how you think*"" (‚ÄîChrist, lady, I was consciously working around my mood cycles and trying to regulate them by the time I was a pre-teen, if not earlier.)

A lot of us have been trying, some way of another, to ""*change our thoughts*"" etc. much earlier in our lives than when you started your degree, Ms PhD ""clinical psychologist"".

And the behavioural approach really is quite simplistic, idealistic even. Quick example: has anyone else noticed that there are a lot MORE than just simply ""*positive*"" and ""*negative*"" thoughts floating around in their head? And that even the ""negative"" thoughts can have value sometimes?

One more example: DBT teaches something called [Wise Mind](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/wisemind.htm). Quite simply, this isn't a thing. It's portrayed as the intersection between an ""emotional mind"" and ""reasonable mind"", but if you ask me *every* thought has some component of reason and emotion, so *what, exactly, is the* ""wisdom"" *here*???

Indeed, DBT in particular seems a lot of AA (*from what I've read of AA on reddit/experienced via people I've met*): it's an out-of-the-box, ready-made worldwiew applied to its audience via methods that more than slightly resemble a cult. It's not my place to insult everyone who has bettered themselves this way, but at the same time, tbh, I've met more than a few who talk about their experience in a way that feels, to me, suspiciously *prescribed*: ""*Yes, DBT has taught me to be much more mindful and regulate my emotions.*""

I just ...I don't like that approach. I hear the words, but I've never been able to relate to the meaning. Am I really supposed to just say things like this until I finally delude myself into believing I'm ""better"" because I belong the group? Is there no actual hope of understanding and regulating myself coming from what I already done?

I've gotten away from my point a bit, but here it is: these values/ideologies feel like they're frickin' *everywhere* now, it's the go-to POV for most school counsellors (though luckily I've found a good one), primarily care physicians, psychologists, ER personnel, and anyone you're likely to talk to on the suicide hotline.

Yes, it's an improvement on stigamatising mental illness outright, but... gosh, it's still pretty rubbish. In some ways, I think, we've even gone backward, because, ...well, I'll put it this way: boffins performing lobotomies and electroshock therapy to ""cure"" people is shitty, but at least these types of people have got some track record of improving their methods over time (from blood-letting and leeches to modern surgical practice).

120,Reducing Distress with CBT and DBT skills by Dr Fardin Jussab,"There may have been times in n your life, after a certain situation arised, when you may have thought, ‚ÄúI wish I had reacted differently‚Äù and/or ‚ÄúI could have dealt with that in a better way!‚Äù
 
This article will outline techniques you may want to use, to control impulsive reactions  to a distressing situation. The techniques discussed below are from Cognitive and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy.
 
Distress is a combination of extreme emotional, physiological, cognitive and behavioral responses that one experiences following an event. When a situation causes us to feel distressed many of us may have a fight, flight or freeze response to the situation. An example of impulsive responses to a situation whereby there is a conflict between two colleagues results of a shouting over one another, finger pointing and shaking. 
 
The aim of the skills discussed below is to help you not to act upon impulse but make a more informed decision of how you would like to deal with a distressing situation. 
 
The skills are a way of distancing and distracting  oneself from the distressing situation, allowing the rational part of the mind (pre frontal cortex) to make a more informed decision and not act upon impulse and hopefully this may reduce feelings of distress. 
 
Situations where these skills could be useful to reduce levels of distress can include: Conflicts and disagreements between colleagues, feeling under pressure from multiple work load demands, feeling isolated and overwhelmed. 
 
Before going through the skills, a pre-foundation base is required. At the time of the distressing situation:
1.Take a deep breath and move away from the situation.
2. Use the distress tolerance skills for at least 20 minutes.
3. Remind yourself that the distress will pass in time. 
 

Below are some examples of the distress tolerance skills: 
 

1. The 54321 technique skill is based upon our senses in which I would like you to notice  5 things you can see right now, 4 things you can hear right now, 3 things you can touch right now, 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste. 
 

2. Name as many things as you can in a room. So for example, if you are in your office, look around the room and name as many items as you can see e.g. clock, computer, desk and so on.
 

3. Do a meaningful activity for 20 mins. Choose an activity that you enjoy doing and is meaningful e.g running, gardening, walking or meditation. 
 

4. Positive filters: at times of distress we often reflect on negative issues and struggle to think about any positive things around us. I would like you to try and recall the positive, encouraging and feel-good moments of your life. 
 

5. Create a Magic box/bag: The items in your bag will be related to your sense, so A FAVORITE: 1.Picture or video 2.Smell 3.Taste 4.Touch and  5.Sound. At the time of feeling distressed use the magic box/bag mindfully to help reduce the feelings of distress. 
 

Besides the above skills, breathing exercises and using mindfulness techniques discussed in previous issues are also very beneficial in reducing feelings of distress. I hope you find these skills useful to use.
 

Overall we all feel distress and experience it differently from one another. 
 

We have to remind ourselves that it is okay to feel distress and that it is an important human reaction. 
 

In the end what matters is being kind to ourselves, as we often are our own worst critics.

I lost my appetite, ability to sleep and started having terrible panic attacks. I can no longer work like this and I have no quality of life. My sleep deprivation caused 'psychosis' and when I don't sleep I hear and see demons, I tried all the anti psychotics but nothing helped, the pregablin did nothing for the anxiety and panic attacks plus the zopiclone does not help me sleep at all. I tried all the CBT on offer and did each course twice, nothing has helped.

I used to be totally normal with a normal life but I have lost all that now and just exist. I eat very healthy and I do as much exercise as my painful body will allow but it does not help much all. I have a psychiatrist and a psychotherapist yet they offer no solutions. I am fed up of suffering and don't know where to go from here? I suffer 24/7 and sleep 2 hours a night if I  lucky. I just don't know what else I can try? I do yoga and can't improve my diet any further. The panic attacks are getting so bad I am worried about my heart. I just don't know what else I can do/try? The past 2 years have been hell but I have stuck it out for the sake of God and my family but I feel I have exhausted all my options.

**Tl;Dr:**

I believe that ADHD, anxiety, depression, OCD, and a number of other mental disorders might really just be poorly understood and misdiagnosed sleep disorders.

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

**Lets take a look at ADHD:**  


According to the national institute of mental health:

> Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a brain disorder marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development.   
>  
>The most common type of medication used for treating ADHD is called a ‚Äústimulant.‚Äù Although it may seem unusual to treat ADHD with a medication that is considered a stimulant, it works because it increases the brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine, which play essential roles in thinking and attention. 

According to DSM-5:

>\- Symptoms need to have been present since at least the age of 12 years old.  
>  
>\- Symptoms need to negatively affect their lives in two or more settings: (School, Home, Work, etc.)  
>  
>\- Symptoms cannot be better explained by another mental illness, such as anxiety.

  


**Lets take a look at Sleep Deprivation:**

&#x200B;

According to [betterhealth.vic.gov.au](https://betterhealth.vic.gov.au):   
Sleep deprivation affects children in different ways to adults. Sleepy children tend to ‚Äòspeed up‚Äô rather than slow down. Symptoms include: 

 Let‚Äôs say that a person who needs eight hours of sleep per night only gets six. This two-hour sleep loss can have a major impact including:

* Reduced alertness
* Shortened attention span
* Slower than normal reaction time
* Poorer judgement
* Reduced awareness of the environment and situation
* Reduced decision-making skills
* Poorer memory
* Reduced concentration
* Increased likelihood of mentally ‚Äòstalling‚Äô or fixating on one thought
* Increased likelihood of moodiness and bad temper
* Reduced work efficiency
* Loss of motivation
* Errors of omission ‚Äì making a mistake by forgetting to do something
* Errors of commission ‚Äì making a mistake by doing something, but choosing the wrong option
* Microsleep ‚Äì brief periods of involuntary sleeping that range from a few seconds to a few minutes in duration.  


 Selected statistics from research studies into sleep loss and its effects on children and teenagers include:

* Sleep loss causes a range of schooling problems, including naughtiness and poor concentration.
* Chronically sleep-deprived teenagers are more likely to have problems with impulse control, which leads to risk-taking behaviours.
* Sleep problems in teenagers are associated with increased risk of disorders such as depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
* High school students who regularly score C, D or F in school tests and assignments get, on average, half an hour less sleep per night than high school students who regularly get A and B grades.
* Later start times at school result in reduced daytime sleepiness, higher grades and reduced negative feelings.  


**Regardless of if you read all of that or not, you will notice there is an awful lot of overlap between ADHD and the effects of as little as two hours of sleep deprivation.**  


Wikipedia even writes as a symptom of sleep deprivation: ""Symptoms similar to ADHD.""  


A number of studies have shown that treatment for sleep apnea in people diagnosed with ADHD can lessen or even potentially completely cure the symptoms of ADHD in some cases. Here is a decent article on it: [https://www.additudemag.com/add-and-sleep-apnea-problems-solutions/](https://www.additudemag.com/add-and-sleep-apnea-problems-solutions/)  


\---  


**Onwards to the medication:**  


ADHD is traditionally treated with stimulants. Drugs known to stimulate the brain, encouraging attention, focus, and learning. Most people are familiar with an especially popular stimulant: **Caffeine**. Used to stave off tiredness and keep focused on certain tasks. It works in very much the same way as most other stimulants.  


I personally vouch for **Amphetamine**, as It's an incredibly inexpensive stimulant with extensive research and safe use in history, and limited side effects. I would describe 10mg of time-released dexedrine as about equivalent to two-well-spaced cups of coffee throughout the day... but lasting all day... and without the negative side effects.  


Amphetamine has an extensive history of research on its effects and use in delaying and reducing the effects of sleep deprivation, especially in pilots. It's frequently used illegally as a general performance enhancer by academics and athletes alike. It is now used almost exclusively for the treatment of children and adults with adhd. People who exhibit symptoms of sleep deprivation, which are effectively treated with a drug that reduces the effects of sleep deprivation. An illness that is confirmed to have been misdiagnosed sleep deprivation. It works. But does it work for the reason people think it works? Does it work because ""ADHD is treated with stimulants"", or does it work because **""adhd is caused by some form of sleep deprivation""?** Unfortunately i can't answer that. But i think my answer would be obvious.  


Most people diagnosed with ADHD have trouble with sleeping. In fact, I believe that if an extensive study were done, you would find that most people diagnosed with certain mental illnesses have trouble with sleeping, and that a number of their symptoms overlap with symptoms of sleep deprivation. For people diagnosed with mental illnesses, increased sleep deprivation will actually worsen and make their condition much worse and obvious, while 'healthy' neurotypical people will start exhibiting symptoms that could be diagnosed as a mental illness. So would using amphetamine in therapeutic doses help with other mental illnesses? Would using it help people without mental illnesses?  


Studies have shown that for people with ADHD, therapeutic use of amphetamine increases their testing IQ by a substantial amount, because they are able to work faster, and better. While the use of amphetamine on people without ADHD ALSO increases their testing IQ, but by a much smaller amount compared to people with ADHD. Studies involving military pilots using amphetamines have shown very similar results, where pilots who took amphetamines were able to score better after several hours of sleep deprivation than pilots who did not take amphetamines.

**Tl;DR - Personal History:**

Born in Canada to impoverished family w/ mental health, drug, and abuse issues.

From K-12, been to 15 different schools due to family dynamics and ""behavioral issues."" I've been diagnosed with AD(H)D, Bipolar, Major Depression, Oppositional Defiance Disorder, and was tested for Autism (negative).

Started living with abusive maternal family. Began self-harming. Discovered that romantic relationships make the sad go away.

Mental health issues got worse, got into a long toxic relationship that left me traumatized and mutilated.

Then I spent two years discovering and recovering.

Since 2015, I've been happy and healthy, and my mental-health is a complete non-issue. I am stress and medication free, despite circumstances.

&#x200B;

>!I was born in Canada to an impoverished teen mother, and an eccentric father, both highly educated and intelligent (IQ easily in the 115-125 range.) but who faced persistent issues with mental health, drugs, and family+relationship abuse. Both were abused as children, moved out young to escape it, got into drugs, and were never treated or diagnosed for any mental health or abuse related issues. They split up. !<

>!From a young age I showed signs of high intelligence and mental illness. I learned how to read (at least at the same level as most of the semi-literate english world) very young (2 y), was able to make friends very easily, and was able to grasp new concepts very easily. At 2 years old I was dismantling electronics with makeshift tools to learn how they worked. (I personally remember using a butter-knife stolen from the kitchen to remove the panels on the electrical sockets. My family has many more stories about my problematic intelligence, most of which I don't remember.) At 4 years old, I remember learning that my mother wanted to take me to a ""school for the gifted"", and I immediately associated ""gifted"" with ""special"", and ""special"" with ""speshiul"". So when they had me tested, I intentionally flunked every question or test because I didn't want to be associated with mental retardation.!<

>!I started kindergarten in a french school at 4 years old because the school wouldn't allow anyone under 5 into grade 1. Immediately after my birthday, my father had me transferred into grade 1, and I excelled ahead of the other students very quickly. At this point in time my social issues became much more apparent. I was VERY good at making people like me, I played with children normally, with a preference for older children, ""educational toys"", and computer games, But I never had any interest in maintaining relationships. I found playing by myself, or reading books, to be more enjoyable, and as soon as someone left the room, I couldn't care less about seeing them again.!<

>!At this point, my parents had split up, my father stopped dealing marijuana, and returned to school. My mother also returned to school, and I spent the rest of my school years travelling back and forth between them. It started as ""weekends with dad"" and became ""one year with dad, one year with mom"". This was a mutual agreement, and they never went to court or anything over it. This meant that had I wanted to maintain friendships (I didn't) I wouldn't have been able to, because I would be going to a new different school often in a different city almost every year. I developed some kind of OCD/Nervous tick, which my mother believed was an issue with my throat. I had my tonsils removed, tick went away. More on this later. !<

>!I started ""acting out"" at about grade 3-5 ish. But this was mostly just acting without care for social consequences, and treating adults as equals. If an adult said something that i understood to be wrong, like: ""Russia is in Europe"", I would happily argue with them that Russia is in Asia, not Europe, but because it shares borders i understood why they thought otherwise. | A girl crushed an earth-worm under her shoe intentionally, so I shoved her or hit her or something. | I have about 600+ ""Incident reports"" from grades 3-9 involving similar incidents regarding my ""disrespect for authority"", ""violent behaviour"", and ""immature behaviour"", (I was a full year younger than most other students) as well as frequent concerned letters regarding my obvious intelligence, but my inability to apply it in a way appropriate to the classroom. Eventually one incident resulted in me being expelled from school, and being placed in an alternative-behavioural-ed school, and regular psychiatry/therapy appointments. \~Grade 6.!<

>!It was ruled that I probably had ADHD, and that I had ""Oppositional Defiance Disorder"". At this time my mother was addicted to numerous substances, my father was living in another province (state for you Americans), and I was learning that ""if i say what people want to hear, then I can avoid negative consequences."" It was at about this time Grade 5/6 ish that seemingly out of nowhere, I developed an OCD/Depressive Disorder. I was 9-10 years old, and couldn't stop visualizing ways to hurt myself. I couldn't stop thinking of ways to kill myself. I became depressed, the things that interested me no longer did. And my ability to think and learn was severely impacted. After being introduced to behavioral school, I met other people with issues similar but clearly different from mine. The kids there were all 5+ years older than me, and looking back now, It's obvious that their issues stemmed directly from family, physical, sexual, and drug abuse. This environment did little more than expose me to the harsher parts of the world, and I wanted to be able to relate with these ""cool/edgy/attractive"" people. So I started stealing shit, picking fights, etcetera. Doctors wanted me to be medicated, but my family was against it.!<

>!My mother was having problems with drug use, was growing hopeless with my school and home activity, and decided to send me to live with my father in hopes that a change in approach might help. My father had a poor misunderstanding of my issues, and had (continues to have) a personal bias against mental illness and believed that doctors were stupid + I wasn't having issues, I was just misbehaving. After about a year or two of ""traditional parenting"" involving lots of yelling, a belt, and ""father/son bonding""-gone-wrong, I returned to live with my mother and her family. She had just gotten clean, and was sharing a large house (it was a run-down 300 year old 8 bedroom mansion with a pool and an acreage, shipped from europe. neat place.)!<

>!I returned to normal school, but my thoughts were completely focused inwards. I had learned about and began ""burning"", a form of self-abuse involving erasers which left behind large scabs which could be picked at and bled lots, with no serious risk of permanent harm aside from scarring. School went well, but I began getting bullied frequently. My ""ODD"" was obvious here, as rather than submitting to bullies, I acted against them. I was ostracized due to my behavior. As an example, an older kid who frequently teased me for my social ostracization attempted to block my way into a classroom, I attempted to push past him, but he was at least 80lb heavier than me, and I got nowhere. So I attempted to punch him in the face, but couldn't reach as he was nearly a foot taller and ended up hitting him in the throat instead. Then I attempted to push him into a trash can as an ""ironic cinematic anti-bully act"", failed to move him again, and decided to instead hit him across the head with it then dump it over him. This obviously made me look like the instigator/aggressor. Eventually I was expelled. Public mental health treatment had improved, my mother's belief system had changed since she had gotten clean, and she actively sought out therapy and treatment for me. I started trialling ritalin (cancelled within a week), seroquel (cancelled within 2 weeks), and dexadrine, which stuck for about a month or two. I started taking anger management (a special flavor of CBT and mindfulness focussed on behaviour and the safety of OTHERS)!<

>!At 13-15, I began pursuing romantic relationships. These... All... Went... Bad... I had carried over my attraction to ""troubled teens"" from my younger years in behavioural ed and explicitly pursued toxic relationships. As long as I was in a relationship, my depression and OCD seemed to be nonexistant, but returned whenever the relationship eventually ended It would come back in full force. At some point I ran away from my abusive home after a girl living almost 800km away, (She had paid for a greyhound ticket using money from her cell phone she sold), police were called, she was punished, she punished me in return, and I ended up being stuck in this town for two weeks before my mother bought a ticket back. She had lost the ""recovery home"" she got into. (she had been accepted into a housing program for single mothers recovering from abuse, and had been attempting to keep me away from the abuse at the family mansion). I became more reckless in my relationships, and ended up 'moving out' at 14, couch-surfing with different troubled girls who would sneak me into their rooms at night etc. I was off my meds, but my mental health was no longer an issue. Despite being effectively homeless, and spending half of my time in SOMEONE ELSES abusive household, and the other half of my time in a childrens street shelter full of outreach workers, drug-addicted teens, and troubled teens, I avoided drugs and managed to excel in school.!<

>!After a particularly rough episode involving a breakup, abusive family, and police, I had an emotional/stress breakdown which left me hospitalized. I had decided to just ""give up"", going into a psychosomatic catatonic state on a sidewalk somewhere. Hospital came and picked me up, I stayed in the hospital for two weeks because it was determined my family was unsafe. They planned to submit me to the psych ward involuntarily as soon as a bed opened up, but my mother showed up, snuck me out, and put me on a plane to go live with my dad before they got the chance.Dad hadn't changed. Still refused to accept anything was wrong mentally, and that I was just acting out because i was ""bad"". At the end of summer, we got into a physical fight, I flew back to live with my mom (who had since moved again, still clean). She attempted to enroll me in an online alt school/homeschool, but I went behind her back and enrolled myself in public high school. This.. was... difficult. I had resolved to focus more on my social ability, as I had learned that my mental health issues were effectively resolved by being in a relationship. I did fine for a year or two. I had been represcribed dexedrine, which I didn't notice any benefit from at the time, and started trading with another student for marijuana. The next year, I re-enrolled myself in the same grade, with the intent of making the best of free education, enrolling myself in more of the electives i was interested in, and getting ""access"" to a wider range of potential relationships. It was an 8-12 school, I knew that in grade 11, I could date ""9-12"" without any weird looks. But having been younger than everyone in my grade for ages, i was more interested in girls who were my age and younger, and resolved that if i were grade 10, i could still take grade 11 academic courses, grade 10 electives, and date grades 8-12. I did very well for the next two years, then my mother and I moved back to the town with the ""family mansion"" which they had since moved out of.!<

>!I had connected with an old friend who I was romantically interested in. She was a... troubled teen that was 2 years younger than me. I had had a romantic interest in her for years, which she occasionally reciprocated, but it never turned into an actual relationship until i moved back for grade 12. She had an unhealthy relationship with ""creepypastas"", ""darkweb"", Kubrick, and death, and her mannerisms were especially interesting to me. I manipulated the administration at her high school to allow me to enroll there despite my conspicuously troublesome school record, and we began dating. My mother and I had moved into a smaller house shared with two of her relatives, and I recognized that it would become abusive, so I enrolled in a couple of outreach programs which allowed me to rent my own place at 17 years old, w/ subsidized rent and food stamps, which allowed me to focus on my high school. It was perfect. I started pursuing various treatment plans for my mental health, I was rather pushy with my doctors. I was diagnosed Bipolar (at my request), ADHD, and prescribed seroquel, abilify, and a higher dose of dexedrine. I never took the antipsychotics. My mother had since been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.!<

>!I suffered from the abuse in a toxic relationship w/ the girl i was with, and negative side effects from the drugs. I graduated from school, with her graduating a year behind me. But we broke up a few months before in a fucked up situation where she attempted to act on one of her murder fantasies, and then pinned it all on me because ""she was an underage girl, and i was a recently turned 19 year old man with a long history of trouble and mental illness."" I moved away, and was given 18 months probation, and mandatory ""respectful relationships"" group therapy directed at sexist abusive men. The whole thing was very SJW and RadFem and while it might help some demographic somewhere, It was completely inapplicable to most of the people who were forced to attend. I'll give some info on it if anyone is interested. Regardless, I spent the next 18 months focusing on getting through the probation, understanding and changing myself, and then finally, pursuing HEALTHY online relationships. !<

>!At the end of the 18 months, I enrolled myself in university for engineering, completed 1 year, then dropped out because I didnt meet the prereqs for the courses i wanted to take and didnt want to go deep into debt. I then met my current wife of nearly 3 years, and things have been going great for me ever since, and haven't had any issues with mental health, depression, suicidal thoughts, abusive relationships, etcetera, since. !<

***So what's my secret?***

***What changed?***

***What did I learn?***

***And what the fuck does this have to do with amphetamine?***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**I'll start by going into depth about my diagnosis', what they are, why i got them, and my opinions and research on them.**

&#x200B;

**ADHD:** Attention Deficit Disorder is defined as collection of symptoms that affect children, negatively affecting their school, home, and work life. It is characterized most specifically by an inability to focus. It is treated with stimulants.

&#x200B;

***Disclaimer:*** I think ADHD is a myth. More on that in another post.

&#x200B;

I was diagnosed with ADHD because I was a child, who had difficulty w/ focus, and who had trouble in their home, school, and work life. It's fairly straightforwards. I was prescribed stimulants, and my focus improved, and then my home/school/work life. And therefore It's a perfect fit, right?

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

**Major Depressive Disorder:** Major depressive disorder is defined as at least two weeks of low mood, low energy and lack of interest in enjoyable activities. It is treated with antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antianxiety medications. More on this later.

A person who is depressed can be happy, but they'll never be ""that"" happy. At the same time, they can be sad, but they'll never be ""that"" sad. It's more of a general dullness. A lack of caring about anything. A lack of interest in anything.

&#x200B;

***Disclaimer***:  It's frequently confused with ""People who are sad or want to hurt themselves"". That is NOT what depression is. Depression can often affect people who are sad/self abusive, and it can often cause people to be sad or want to hurt themselves. But being sad or wanting to hurt yourself doesn't mean that you are depressed. If you're having crying fits and everything makes you sad, or you're having unexplained suicidal thoughts, I think you're more likely to be having issues with **Anxiety, BPD,** or **OCD,** than with depression.

&#x200B;

I was diagnosed with depression because I had a lack of interest in activities that used to be enjoyable to me, i had trouble focusing, and i frequently described periods of being ""blegh"" and indifference. I think this fits.

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

**Bipolar Disorder:** Bipolar depressive disorder is defined as frequent shifts between manic and depressive states. Depression as described above. Mania is very poorly defined, but generally means ""high energy"" and ""high mood.""  Like depression, high mood doesn't necessarily mean ""very happy"", it means ""very happy, very sad, very angry, etc."" and generally means extreme emotions.

&#x200B;

***Disclaimer***: I believe that doctors frequently over-diagnose people as being bipolar because of two things: Patient misunderstanding of bipolar, and doctor misunderstanding. Patients diagnosed with bipolar frequently go in ASKING to be diagnosed as bipolar because they THINK that they are bipolar. Many doctors will take the easy path, and go with it. I think that a lot of people who think that they are bipolar, are more likely to be people with **BPD**, a similarly defined condition that is poorly understood and under-diagnosed.  It definitely doesn't help that ""Bipolar Disorder"" and ""Borderline Personality Disorder"" are named the way they are, because ""BPD"" could serve as an accronym for either of them. Bipolar also sounds like ""shifting between two extremes"" where ""borderline"" sounds more like ""being on the edge of"".

**Bipolar disorder** *is more like* ***""shifting from extreme emotion, to extreme lack of emotion.""***

**BPD** *is more like* ***""shifting from one extreme emotion, to a different extreme emotion.""***

&#x200B;

I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder because i went in asking to be diagnosed with it, manipulatively describing symptoms of bipolar disorder in hopes of being diagnosed with it. I do believe that I experience depression and manic episodes, as in bipolar, but it does not negatively affect my life and therefore does not need to be medicated, and is not classified as a ""mental disorder"", which is defined as: ***""causing significant distress or impairment of personal function.""***

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

**Borderline Personality Disorder:** defined as a long-term pattern of unstable relationships, emotional instability, and an unstable sense of self. It usually results in dangerous behavior and self-harm. It's associated with substance abuse, eating disorders, depression, and suicide. It is more commonly diagnosed in women than in men, and there is no specific medication used to treat it, but CBT (mindfulness) is used to reduce the likelihood of suicide and manage negative symptoms. People with BPD are more likely to have environmental factors affecting them, such as abuse.

&#x200B;

***Disclaimer:*** I believe this is frequently misdiagnosed as **Bipolar Disorder** because it is less ""popular"" in the media than bipolar disorder, and less people hear about it or understand what it is. It also has a misleading/difficult to understand name, as does bipolar disorder. See my thoughts on bipolar disorder for more.

&#x200B;

I was never diagnosed with BPD, but my mother was, and I'm likely affected by it because it is 'assumed' to have genetic factors + I was raised by someone who has it (environmental factors). I've gone through a number of **CBT** and mindfulness programs for other reasons, but I have found that mindfulness/cbt practices DO help with my mental state substantially.

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

**Anxiety Disorder:** Anxiety covers more than one disorder, all of which are defined as having feelings of fear or emotional anxiety. It's frequently misunderstood by the public, and extremely common. There are four forms of anxiety that are most talked about: Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Phobias. It's officially treated with **SSRI's,** and unofficially treated with **hypnotics** and **sedatives**. I'll try to be quick about each:

&#x200B;

***Generalized Anxiety***: Feelings of anxiety, worry, or more accurately described: stress, over anything and everything in particular. These feelings can come and go, but generally result in a reduced quality of life. This can develop at a young age, or over time. I think you could best describe generalized anxiety as debilitating stress, keeping you from sleeping, making you grouchy/snappy and irritable, and resulting in fatigue and problems with focus and concentration.

&#x200B;

***PTSD:*** Feelings of anxiety typically accompanied by panic attacks and associated with triggers, known or unknown. This form of anxiety disorder is explicitly understood to have been developed as a result of environmental factors, and can develop much later than the actual initial trauma. It usually becomes a feedback loop, where in an attempt to avoid it, someone with PTSD actually spends additional time worrying and focusing on their anxiety or known triggers.

&#x200B;

***Panic Disorder:*** Brief episodes of terror and debilitating anxiety. This is almost exactly the same as PTSD, except that the cause is not known, or is not particularly 'traumatic'.

&#x200B;

***Phobias:*** Very specific irrational fears, typically something that the person spends time worrying and being afraid of, despite the object of their fear being either benign, or unlikely to affect them. Seeing a shark and becoming frozen with fear because you watched jaws at a young age isn't a phobia of sharks, as the fear is rational. Having trouble sleeping because you're going to an indoor swimming pool tomorrow, and you're helplessly imagining thousands of incredibly unlikely scenarios involving a shark being there, is. Being afraid of knives and not wanting to touch them or be around someone who is using them because you're scared you might accidentally injure yourself somehow, is not really an irrational fear, compared to someone going into a state of panic because someone sitting across the room has an exposed elbow. (Yes, I have met someone with a phobia of elbows.)

&#x200B;

***Disclaimer:*** Anxiety is heavily stigmatized in modern culture, with many people abusing it as an excuse for their behaviors, and other people thinking other people abuse it as an excuse for their behavior. Yes, there ARE people who label themselves as having ""Anxiety"" because they want to have more labels. Maybe they have anxiety, maybe they don't. They probably do. Using labels can help people communicate their feelings and issues to others, and can help people relate to other people, and it can help them understand themselves and figure out how to interact with the world around them in a healthy way. It shouldn't be used to avoid interactions or excuse shitty behavior. I've got a bit to say about this to anyone who asks.

&#x200B;

I have been diagnosed with anxiety because I have PTSD related to abuse and trauma, caused by my family, abusive relationships, and bullying in school.

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

**Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder:** is defined as having certain uncontrollable compulsions or intrusive and obsessive thoughts, typically irrational, and taking substantial time each day. It's associated with stress, anxiety, trauma, and suicide.

&#x200B;

***Disclaimer:*** The media almost exclusively covers compulsions and it's publicly joked/understood that OCD is a neat-freak thing. Like wanting things to be symmetrical, or a certain shade of red, etcetera. I think that wanting things to be ""neat"" is a human perfectionism thing that affects everyone, and is typically unrelated to having OCD. What the media fails to communicate and the public fails to understand is the ""obsessive"" aspect of OCD. This can be anything from persistently worrying about your appearance/weight, to intrusive thoughts of self-harm, suicide, or social standing, and looping or repetitive thoughts. I think that OCD should be redefined as the publicly understood ""compulsions"" only, as the obsessive aspect of the disorder overlaps with anxiety, and affects MOST people, possibly ALL people, under certain circumstances, to a certain extent.

The most problematic form of OCD is a symptom of intrusive and obsessive thoughts that people don't recognize or associate with OCD: Suicidal ideation, and thoughts of self harm. This can be anything from /randomly/ thinking ""what if i jumped out this window"" to ""i wish i was dead, i wish i was dead, i wish i was dead..."" etc, that is erroneously associated with other mental illness like anxiety and depression.

&#x200B;

I am not diagnosed with OCD. My youngest brother is. I probably would be if I spoke to a doctor about it. During my younger years, this affected me more than anything else, and resulted in me developing PTSD and anxiety, and is probably **the most likely cause of suicide**.

I found it very hard to think of specific problems rather than just general issues I face. The doctor assured me that next time I needed to come with granular problems for the CBT to be helpful.

""I don't know, there wasn't a thought that triggered it, thats just how I feel"". She told me that thoughts always trigger feelings, and I need to work on identifying negative thought patterns. I just don't get it! I just have a lot of emotions but I can't really explain all of them.

141,CBT Keeper: An Android app for depression and anxiety.,"My name is Jeff Clark, and I'm a medical student at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University (it's a mouthful, I know). I was frustrated by how many of my patients were receiving only antidepressants for depression and anxiety, when I knew that many of them would benefit from a combination of both medication and therapy. However, because of poor insurance coverage, lack of access to therapists, or stigma, many patients never receive anything more than visits with their primary care provider. I knew I wouldn't be able to create a full-scale therapy resource, but I tried my hand at coding up an Android app that could turn the basic principles of CBT into a simple game. The app is called CBT Keeper, and it's been in beta for a few months, but the full release is now ready and I wanted to make it available to the community here on reddit. The app is free with ads, but there is a $1.99 in app purchase to remove ads. Hopefully, I'll be able to raise enough revenue to port the app to iOS and eventually build it out into something even more helpful. I'd appreciate any feedback you can give me on the app!

You can check out the app on Google Play (http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.euthymiclabs.cbtkeeper) or Kindle Fire (http://www.amazon.com/Euthymic-Labs-Keeper-depression-anxiety/dp/B00ITYJMXA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1409173312&sr=8-1&keywords=cbt+keeper).

145,CBT Journal Template for someone who is Single and Introverted and has a Hobby,"I made a journal template a few months ago and I have found it useful, so I am sharing it here. It is slightly complicated, but you don't have to use all of the cells if you don't want to. Basically, every day you enter in values for your mood, anxiety, and whether you performed a certain habit or not. The habits I have in there are social, sleep, supplements, stretching, meditation, guitar, reading, and jogging. There are more clarifications to the right of the journal in the document. The values needed to get a 100 are entered into the first week. The goal is not necessarily to get a 100, I just wanted a consistent way to track my progress at these habits and I don't like all of the habit apps, so I built my own. The reason sleep is a 2 is because you can go to bed on time, but wake up late, or vice versa. I made the socializing habit more complicated because I believe that it's important to be social and to keep track of how often you are social if you have social anxiety like I do. What gets measured gets managed, right? But I weigh certain social activities much more heavily than other ones. Feel free to change this all up if you want to!

&#x200B;

If you want to adjust the math, just keep in mind the bottom row of each week has math in it that creates a score out of 100 for each different habit, and the YELLOW box to the right is where the final week's score is displayed. That box just takes the average of all of the other scores.

&#x200B;

The CBT portion of the journal is such that you can double click any cell and view a whole page of a journal entry at once. It's more difficult to read all the way through than a word document, but the point is to be able to look at a few paragraphs of journaling while seeing as much other data as possible at the same time, on the same page.

&#x200B;

With this journal, you can easily copy all of the text from an entire week of journaling and use a word counting app to see what your mind has been on the most lately. There is a word counting app available as a plugin for google docs, although I am not necessarily recommending it. I sincerely hope someone else finds this journal useful. I don't think it's necessary to use it every day of your life, but if you are into journaling and knowing data about yourself, then this should be fun for you.

&#x200B;

The first link is editable, so someone might ruin it for some reason, but I put a second link to a non-editable version that you can download and upload back to Google Docs if you need to use that. I couldn't figure out how to share it in a non-editable form that would also let people just make a copy. If you know how to do that, let me know. Thanks!

&#x200B;

I should note that this journal is impossible to print...

Looking to Vent and Gain Insight from Major Depressive Disorder Survivors,"I‚Äôve been receiving treatment and reading a book on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that my doctor has provided. I have been religious about taking my meds and trying to practically apply the CBT. A little background on my situation, my job requires me to be away from my family (wife and three kids) and due to job related training travel, and COVID, I have only seen them in person for a total of about three months since May of 2019. As you can imagine I have absolutely withdrawn from people and find it very difficult, even self sabotaging to make new friends. In my mind, I avoid making new friends out of respect for my wife. We have had issues with who I chose as friends in the past and it‚Äôs just easier to be without. With that being said, my wife is my best friend. Every time I‚Äôm depressed or feel like hanging myself, I confide in her and it triggers her depression and anxiety. I can see the toll it takes on her and the last thing I want. After we hang up, it makes me want to take my life even more. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle and I feel like a prisoner in my own job, life, and head.

164,Should I see a psychologist AND a psychiatrist? Want to try CBT counseling but maybe meds as well,"
I have suffered from anxiety for the past few years and I am just now making my first effort to talk to someone and hopefully get the problem under control. I suffer from anxiety which seems to be getting worse, to the point where it is starting to effect my life more than it was before.


I want to try CBT counseling, but I also want to talk to a psychiatrist and maybe try some meds- I am not sure how I am mentally and I feel like I may have another problem which is causing my anxiety, possibly ADHD or maybe depression.


 I am wondering - should I make an appointment with a psychologist who does CBT counseling and then also a psychiatrist to maybe talk about some meds or getting some mental evaluation done on my brain? Or should I just talk to a psychiatrist who also does CBT counseling? Like I said, this is the first time I am doing anything like this, so I am not sure where to start, but I called my insurance and got a list of doctors, so now I just need to make some calls, etc.


I have never taken any medication for my anxiety. I have tried xanax and propranolol, both of which do nothing to help my anxiety. I have never been tested for ADHD (even when I was a kid) but I feel like I may have that as well. My anxiety mainly stems from social anxiety which then creates general anxiety that is effecting my life more and more in a bad way.

X confessed that they worry immensely about failing and fear disappointing themselves, so they don't make time for anything else like a hobby for themselves, and studies consume X.

from my research, I have noted down talk-therapy, EMDR, CBT and its offsets, ACT, DBT (being an offset of CBT), exposure therapy and somatic therapy. i've also noted down a few notes from my little research ; they have to \*decide\* they want to get better was a big one.  
my feelings are that the best ones for X could be a mix of, by order, DBT to help ground things and have a way to reduce harm and stress. then, CBT to deal with the source itself. exposure therapy seemed interesting but mainly because of my lack of knowledge on it i'm (ironically) a bit scared by it. if the source of the way of thinking of it was trauma-related, maybe EMDR would be needed. then, of course have some additional support by way of being with friends, mindfulness, ways to cope like breathing exercices, etc...

180,"What to expect from a first time ""Psychiatric Consult"" referral from my medical doctor? Already on meds and done CBT.","Hello,

My medical doctor wrote me a refferral for a ""Psych Consult"" to a local psychiatric office and I was wondering what to expect/where it goes from here.

The details are as follows, but I can provide more if needed:

- On SSRI, Vyvanse, and Zolpidem (Ambien)
- Diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety, ADD
- Seen significant improvement, but still have low energy, low/no sex drive, sometimes feeling like ""nothing really matters""/ no motivation, and some brief periods of sadness.
- Already on medication, did CBT (10 weeks 4 years ago), and life is generally functional, but not great.
- About 4 years ago, I gained 62 pounds (5'10"" and went from ~190 to 250) and started binge eating 2 or 3 days a week. The other 4-5 days I eat very healthy, but the binge days are bad. This never happened before until about 4 years ago.
- Main doctor wants me to go to the consult to just see what she says. No explicit goals or other instructions.
- I don't have the ability to leave work frequently for therapy or frequent visits and would prefer not to do that, but I don't want the Psych to think that I am against treatment, fishing for more meds, or whatever.

So, if I've already done CBT, am on meds, and in a stable, but not amazing situation, then what is the likely outcome or path forward I should expect from the psych or my main doctor?

181,I went to CBT therapy for anxiety... but feel like it was useless. Was I actually anxious in the first place? Or was my anxiety just different?,"Hey all. A while ago I started to decide to try and get my mental health sorted a bit. And it started with sorting out my anxiety. 

We were living with my inlaws, and MIL was invading my personal bubble in such ways that I was having what I would have called anxiety attacks, where I would go and hide in the bathroom and have an emotional breakdown because she had been in our room and it was no longer a safe space for me.

When explaining my anxiety to the mental health nurse (I think he was nurse level anyway, I struggle with memory) he seemed confused why I was focusing on this. He seemed to have it lodged in his mind that I had issues with worry. That I struggled in my relationship with my BPD partner because I was full of what ifs. Banged on about hypothetical worry. 

About my partner I kept saying; it's not an if 're relapses, it's a when. And I don't know if I'm able to deal with it again. I have anxiety because I'm reacting to his good times the same way I would react to his bad times. And I need to learn how to act differently.

But he focused on this what if scenario constantly. So I went through the motions, and knew most of the ""answers"" already. If I have a what if then I find a solution. If I get lost I enjoy the scenery. If my bus is delayed, ah well, nothing to be done about it now. Apparently I already knew alot about CBT. I wonder why when my BPD partner basically caused me to learn it to survive our relationship /s

So I guess I'm asking... Was I just put in the wrong type of therapy? Did I have anxiety? Is anxiety only about worry? That just doesn't feel right.

I felt like such a fraud coming out of it no better of then when I went in, but being such a people pleaser I couldn't refocus the sessions after my first few tries of ""hey, this is what I'm struggling with"" ""ok, but what about these types of thoughts""",1557266427.0,False,4,4,LastOni,None,blwv8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/blwv8o/i_went_to_cbt_therapy_for_anxiety_but_feel_like/

191,Your examples of how psychotherapy has helped or not helped :confused:,"Hi there,

I am a person who has been in therapy (with some breaks) for \~5 years already. Mostly in CBT therapy, because my main issue was dealing with anxiety (usually health related). During the therapy I became acquainted with such a 'great' thing like extrasystoles, which I hate and sometimes feel too often because I'm anxious about it. So after 5 years I would not say I am a resilient super human. I can't even say that I feel better now. I write diary so I admit that some aspects are better for sure, others are worth. I've spent tens of thousands of dollars on it, and changed 5 or 6 specialists during this time.

I have been thinking about it recently and decided to check reddit posts on this topic. And found a huge number of threads where people are complaining about psychotherapy and the fact that it didn't help.  But you can here from every corner, from every related book that 60-70-80% of mental health issues (of course I'm not talking about complex  psychiatric diseases  ) could be  effectively  treaded, that there are already a lot of researches supporting these statistics with concrete numbers.  Nevertheless, the reality seems different when speaking to individuals who've undergone therapy

I'm genuinely interested in your feedback and would like to compare success and failure experiences. Please share your experiences‚Äîwhat specific issues you aimed to address through psychotherapy, the type of therapy employed (whether CBT, ACT, Gestalt, or others), and what outcomes you observed.

Many people seem to think that therapy is like in the movies, where you lay on a couch and talk about your past. However, this is based on an older method of therapy that most therapist don't use anymore.

Nowadays some therapist use cognitive behavioral therapy. Ofcurse, you need to explain what you struggle with first, and what method of therapy is used depends on what your problems are. But usually a therapist that works with conitive behavioral therapy will be able to teach you techniques on how to improve your mental health. During sesions, a therapist will explain these techniques to you and advise you on how you can use them. The next sesion, the therapist will ask you if you treid the techniques and if they worked for you. If not, they can suggest  a different approach or something else you can try.

You should also know that if you had a bad experiance whit a therapist, than that just means that that particular therapist or the method they use is not for you, and you can go find an other therapist. Please  just don't give up after just one or two bad experiaces.

202,Should Someone on SSRIs be Seeing a Pyschologist?,"I was first diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) about 15 years ago. I saw a psychologist for about a year, which didn't help much. Then, I saw a psychiatrist who put me on Zoloft and organised for me to see a different psychologist. I don't think the other psychologist helped much either, but the Zoloft was one of the best things that ever happened to me.  

People were nicer to me (that's how it seemed)
I was more energetic
Food actually tasted better
Etc

Although there are still SAD things I struggle with today

I saw the psychiatrist for a few years every six months. At one point, there was a mix-up or something in my appointments, and I never called back to make a new one.I continued to get scripts for Zoloft from my doctor. He kept pushing for me to see a psychologist. He had sent  me to 3 different ones while I'd been seeing him without much progress.

Every so often, my doctor makes me see a psychiatrist again to review my medications. Usually, they then push me to see a psychologist again. In addition, I have also seen some psychologists myself at times when I have felt down over periods, mostly to talk. 

I'm not really very good at psychologists. I have done Cognative Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) so many times.

208,Behavioral and Cognitive Theories on OCD,"Behavioral and Cognitive Theories On OCD: 

Behavioral Theory: 

The behavior theory suggests that human beings with OCD associate certain things or circumstances with fear, and that they discover ways to stay away from the important things they worry about or to perform rituals that help lessen the concern. 

One the sensation of concern becomes set up, human entities with OCD keep away from the matters they fear, rather than face or tolerate the fear. 

In behavior therapy individuals with OCD find ways to face and reduce their anxiety without working toward avoidance or ritual conduct. After they learn how to straight face their fears, they be less afraid. 

Cognitive Theory: 

The cognitive theory focuses on how people with OCD misread their thoughts. 

The majority of people have intrusive or unwelcome thoughts just like the ones pronounced by way of human beings with OCD. Many people shake off those intrusive thoughts. However, people with OCD might exaggerate the value of the thought, and respond as if it represents a real hazard. 

In cognitive treatment, people ‚Äúunlearn‚Äù their incorrect beliefs and exchange their styles of thought. Through doing so, they have the ability to get rid of the anguish connected with such thoughts and to stop their compulsive habits. 

Some Solutions:

Left untreated, OCD generally develops into a persistent condition with episodes where symptoms appear to enhance. 

First-line treatments for OCD will regularly include: 

1. CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)  
2. SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake inhibitors).   
3. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

CBT is very effective. There are two treatments under CBT. These are ERP(An exposure and reaction avoidance) and Exposure and Response Avoidance (ERP). 

These CBT treatments involve direct exposure to the conditions that cause fear and anxiety while avoiding reaction and responding in the usual matter that‚Äôs been enhancing the OCD. 

Stretching can help people with anxiety problems relax themselves and so they might upgrade the impacts of treatment. There is evidence that vigorous practice may have a quieting impact. Since caffeine, certain illegal medications, and even some other pharmaceuticals can disrupt the  sings of anxiety issues, they ought to be avoided them. To put it simply: Do not do drugs or any medication the doctors haven‚Äôt prescribed, and don‚Äôt use caffeine. Talk to your medical professional or drug professional before taking any extra medications.",1680433146.0,False,2,0,ocd-and-anxiety,None,129htxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/129htxo/behavioral_and_cognitive_theories_on_ocd/
209,At my wits end/advice (UK),"I‚Äôve suffered from depression and anxiety from around the age of 14 (now in late 20s). I also display symptoms of ADHD and OCD and have been confirmed to have OCD by the adult mental health team without ever receiving an official diagnosis (eg. Yes you display all symptoms, that‚Äôs what it is). I am currently on the waiting list for an ADHD referral (in my local area, the NHS waiting list is around 5 years- ridiculous!). I have previously been prescribed citalopram, duloxetine, mirtazapine and am currently taking sertraline (max dosage) and amitriptyline. Have previously done CBT in person and online and found it no help.

I have recently (past 3 months or so) been very low and have been having suicidal thoughts (no plans to act on it), struggling to get out of bed most days, with no appetite and poor sleep. I contacted my Dr who has said they plan to refer me again for CBT, and to wean me off sertraline before putting me on Venlafaxine. 

I‚Äôve found sertraline to be the closest to success I‚Äôve had with antidepressants, and I‚Äôm aware that it is also prescribed for the treatment of OCD (unsure if it is helping me with these symptoms) so I am reluctant to change. 

I am just looking for advice as I feel like I‚Äôm constantly being fobbed off by the Drs, having never been referred to a psychiatrist and told to try meditating or the headspace app. I‚Äôm at my wits end, feeling so low, trying a never-ending cycle of antidepressants and told to try apps and CBT.

212,What types of therapy work best for bipolar spectrum disorders?,"The treatment of bipolar spectrum disorders typically involves a combination of different approaches, including medication, psychotherapy, and lifestyle adjustments. There is no single best therapy for bipolar disorder, as treatment plans should be tailored to individual needs and preferences. However, several types of therapy have been found to be effective in managing bipolar symptoms and promoting overall well-being. Here are some commonly utilized therapies:  
  
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): CBT helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to mood instability. It focuses on developing coping strategies, problem-solving skills, and relapse prevention techniques.  
Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): DBT combines elements of CBT with mindfulness practices. It helps individuals regulate intense emotions, improve interpersonal relationships, and develop effective coping mechanisms for managing distress.  
Family-Focused Therapy (FFT): FFT involves the individual with bipolar disorder and their family members. It aims to improve communication, reduce family conflict, and educate family members about the disorder. This therapy can help create a supportive and stable environment.  
Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT): IPSRT focuses on stabilizing daily routines and sleep patterns, as disruptions in these areas can trigger mood episodes. It also addresses interpersonal issues and aims to improve social functioning.  
Psychoeducation: This involves providing education and information about bipolar disorder, including its symptoms, triggers, and treatment options. Psychoeducation helps individuals and their families better understand the condition and actively participate in managing it.  
It's important to note that medication management plays a crucial role in treating bipolar spectrum disorders, and therapy is often used in conjunction with medication. Collaborating with a qualified mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, can help determine the most suitable therapy approach based on individual needs and preferences.",1684234036.0,False,1,0,Sam_Bhandary,None,13j1ox0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/13j1ox0/what_types_of_therapy_work_best_for_bipolar/

214,"It is healthiest for your words, actions, and the content you consume to be consistent with your mood?","In one ear, I'm hearing toxic positivity is bad because it makes you lock your emotions down until they eventually get so bad you do something heinous. 

But in the other, CBT, DBT, and other therapeutic modularities suggest manipulating your behaviors, the songs you listen to, etc. so they contradict the strong emotion you're experiencing.

216,Is there a double standard on how we treat people who are vulnerable,"I find it strange that people would say let‚Äôs see the ‚Äúabilities in those with disabilities‚Äù but are quick to judge those with mental illness as sick despite going through treatment. I don‚Äôt see people saying things such as let‚Äôs see the ‚Äúsanity action  in the insane days‚Äù or something similar. for every actions that was done rationally and not as a result of the illness. My point is we don‚Äôt  praise those with mental illness such as psychosis and bipolar for their actions considered more sane/rational more frequently but leave them to result to self affirmation. Those with those conditions already suffer from a decrease in self worth which reflects in their appearance. For instance someone going through depression that find it hard to make their bed in the morning, should be commended for putting in the effort to make their bed despite their mental health condition as this is a powerful gesture of self will.  I guess CBT tow according to that line briefly. But we are however quick to  resort to medication and CBT is very intrinsically rather than extrinsic.

I understand that mental illness can be considered a disability but I am trying to separate typical common disabilities such as Autism and intellectual disability with a mental health disability such as bipolar or schizophrenia.

I think both can have a genetic component to it as well as environment component and a slogan that promotes external self affirmation can go along way in motivating people to think rational.",1695337698.0,False,1,0,tasty_chocolatey,None,16ouf8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/16ouf8w/is_there_a_double_standard_on_how_we_treat_people/
