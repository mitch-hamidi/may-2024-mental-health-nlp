0,Involuntary hospitalization,"I’m reaching to see if anyone on here has experience with being “probated” unnecessarily.  I am an ER nurse and we see a lot mental health patients being forced to come in by police escort for treatment.  They are placed on a 72 hour hold by a judge.  Many times this is warranted for a true psychiatric break or because one is suicidal or homicidal.  However, I occasionally come across people who have no idea why a loved one, friend or even neighbor has called the police and insist that none of the stories of them being suicidal or acting irrational are true.

One you have a “pink slip” it’s very difficult to get it removed until the 72 hour mark.  I can’t help but wonder if this law is being abused by people trying to be vindictive.  I can’t help but feel their is a lot of abuse to this system and often feel like I’m participating in a kidnapping.  I’d love to know your story if this is something you have been through.  I’m trying to right an article on the broken mental health system that would encompass this aspect.

1,"Hospitalization, is it helpful?","In high school, all my friends were consistently getting hospitalized for suicide attempts and they always seemed so traumatized by being “locked up” in a psych ward. I was recently diagnosed with bipolar, given no coping techniques or literally anything else, just “You’re bipolar, up your mood stabilizers” and that’s it.

5,Schizophrenia prognosis after years without treatment? Would hospitalization help?,"My mother is 62 years old and has had schizophrenia for about 25 years. She doesn't acknowledge that she has an illness and refuses any treatment; she has hardly ever sought treatment. I constantly wonder what to do. I feel guilty about any of the possibilities.

* One option would be involuntary hospitalization (if possible because she's not physically violent), but that would be very harsh. Do you know of any such cases and how a person in her situation might evolve?
* Another option is to continue as we are now, without treatment (I repeat, there's no way to convince her, I've tried everything for years), but it's very tough because she lives in her delusions, lying down, and her only motivation is to eat non-stop. Besides, my siblings and I are starting our own lives (my brother and I abroad), she currently lives with my grandmother, but she's increasingly alone.

Her symptoms are:  
She believes she is the reincarnation of historical figures (Marie Antoinette, queens in general...) and that she is wealthy. She is waiting for a ""signature"" that will grant her access to a huge inheritance; she believes she is one of the richest people in the world. This aspect I would say is the most positive because, although untrue, it gives her hope for something good. On the other hand, she has more paranoid moments, during which she claims that there are other people trying to impersonate us, her children. She becomes loud and agitated, saying things like ""she is not a servant,"" etc.  
She has very different days from each other; sometimes she is very calm, affectionate, and you can have quite a good conversation with her. Other days, she is very agitated; those are the days when she is more paranoid.  
Unfortunately, the days when she is agitated tend to predominate. When she is calm, if anything related to her illness, work, travel, or money is mentioned, she can quickly become agitated. She also talks to God and claims that God speaks to her.

For more context on why she didn't receive treatment:

I'm not exactly sure when the illness began; I was a child, and it was a very difficult time with many changes, so I don't know if the situation led to her developing the illness or vice versa.  
She is a doctor, and in those years, I wanted to go live with my grandmother (that's what they told me, I was 7, I remember my mother being sometimes violent with me and ignoring me; my grandmother made me feel safe.). My younger siblings stayed with her and my father. It was a difficult time in our country, so they had nowhere to live, in short, it was all very tough.  
Given the whole economic situation and the fact that my father and grandmother were in denial about her illness, she didn't receive treatment.  
Until about my 18 years old, I was in the same denial, believing she had a minor illness and that when we could afford good treatment, she would be cured and go back to work and everything.  
Then I realized that wasn't the case and that it was very serious. Since then, I've tried to get her treatment; at one point, she saw a psychiatrist who came to the house, and we gave her medication without her knowing.  
She only agreed to one appointment and took the medication, but it lasted for 2 or 3 months. I remember she was better during that time, but my brother says she seemed more drowsy or out of it.

Incredibly, despite our childhood, my siblings and I have managed to move forward. But my mother's situation is something that prevents me from feeling fully happy; when something good happens to me, I noticed that I feel sad and I think it's related to her. I think I feel guilty for not doing anything. But forcing her would also make me feel bad.

I have a specific role at my job where I have clients assigned to me for a 9-4 period in the day. The issue is, partial hospitalization also takes place during this time.

I have no issue being honest with my manager. She is very understanding and has also been open about issues like this herself, however, I fear that my honesty with my instability at this time, especially at a job like this, will deem me incompetent and allow them to fire me.

10,starting PHP (partial hospitalization program) tomorrow and am so anxious,"I think what I’m looking for is reassurance that the apprehension and anxiety I am feeling about starting this program tomorrow is normal.

I’m a 22 y/o student who had to put their life on hold as I had a complete mental breakdown over the holidays where I also broke my sobriety. I dropped out of college, quit my job, forfeited opportunities for internships to pursue mental wellness for myself and I’m starting to question whether I’m actually ready for help. Granted, I don’t have much going for me or anything to lose for that matter bc my will to live has been in the gutter.

However, I do need the help and was admitted to the program for good reason. It’s daunting because many patients in the program; on average, “graduate” within 6 months time. It’s a huge commitment. I feel like I’m not worth the investment of my own time and energy. Additionally I feel like my perception of “progress” could be VERY different from how the staff views my progress in the program… that freaks me out.

12,What do you tell people after hospitalization?,"Hi guys, I hope I can ask this here.

I was recently hospitalized and then sent to a crisis centre for suicidal ideation/plan. I was put on sick leave 4 weeks from work.

I am stressed trying to figure out what I will tell work colleagues when I go back… I know people will ask questions as to why I was gone so long.

I feel like saying ”oh it’s personal” is too secretive/rude? And I can’t think of a convincing acute physical illness that would have taken me out of work so long. 

I’m scared that everyone will judge me if I disclose it was mental health related. I know it’s the stigma that is holding me back but I don’t know if I feel comfortable with people knowing I have mental health issues.

13,Hospitalization Worries,"Anybody been hospitalized before in a mental health facility? I wanted to voice some concerns/worries/ask some questions to people who would know and hopefully actually answer.

I had an assessment at a mental health hospital this morning and I ""passed"" (not sure what word to use there) and yeah, they want to admit me. Luckily, I argued against inpatient care and am doing a ""Partial Program"" where I get to go home at the end of the day.

I had asked the doctors what I was getting into exactly and I feel that they were kinda dodgy on the answer. ""Group and some one-on-one therapy,"" was the answer I got. I just wonder how this is supposed to help? I mean I do regular therapy weekly, and yeah, that's only for an hour, and something that progresses over time. So how will hours and hours and hours a day really be ""better"" or any different? I also worry about getting ""therapied"" out by the end of the day.

I have never done group therapy before and really am not comfortable with the idea. How do you deal with being in a room with people you don't know and haven't established trust with and you have to open up and share? Plus, no offense, listen and deal with other people that you'd really rather just be anywhere else while they're talking? I'm also shy and get social anxiety (apparently I have a social avoidant personality disorder). I don't like the idea of sharing private things with people I don't know. And with the trust thing, my psychotherapist earned my trust over time, I don't really see myself just opening up to strange doctors and whoever right away because I ""have to,"" yet at the same time I don't want to be difficult. 

I was VERY insistent that they are not allowed to go anywhere near my medications. I don't want them messed with. Especially since I had a recent issue where a new med wound up screwing up my others (and me) pretty badly. I am now getting ok again and starting to move forward so I definitely don't want to go through that again. That was the excuse (and it is true) that I gave them to justify my decision, although truthfully, I really just wasn't comfortable with them messing with it.

Anyways, those are my worries. I don't know how legitimate any of them are. I just wanted some advice, I guess. I'm really super nervous about doing this.",1632622896.0,False,3,25,Asch_Lavigne,None,pvku6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/pvku6s/hospitalization_worries/
14,Going to Partial Hospitalization soon,"A long time ago I was placed in an IOP (Intense Outpatient Program) for my mental health. I did not like it at all. I had to go 5 days a week for several hours, to open myself to a room full of strangers.

Now that I'm in a new clinic, they recently they told me to an IOP at another hospital, and they assured me it was less intense (3 days a week, for 3 hours or something). I go, and they tell me that I have to do their ""partial hospitalization"" program which is 5 days a week from 9:30am - 1:30pm.

15,Do I really need to go to a partial hospitalization program?,"3 years ago I had a bad “trip” on weed and it triggered intense feelings of derealization for me. Since then, I’ve been having extremely short (literally like 2 seconds) but almost daily episodes of feeling that derealization feeling. Nowadays it’s worst when I’m trying to sleep - I’ll experience it really intensely and snap awake before trying to sleep again. The feeling that my surroundings, memories, or even myself aren’t real causes me to panic and I’m frequently tense worrying that it’ll happen again. I’ve been prescribed a ton of meds throughout the past 3 years, including Abilify for a few months and an entire year of taking Klonopin. Currently I’m just taking Buspar and Elavil. I’ve been to 3 different counselors since this all started. The Klonopin did help, but I don’t want to go back on it because of its dependency-causing nature. My current counselor suggested I get assessed by a nearby mental hospital to see what they think I should do moving forward. Earlier today I got assessed and they recommended a PHP. I was surprised because that seems even more intense than an IOP. Fortunately, the PHP is 100% covered by my insurance if I do decide to go.

16,"Friend was terminated from job after inpatient hospitalization, is this discrimination?","Hi all, trying to keep short: I took a friend to the mental health clinic on Friday, after they left work Thursday with a mental break down (severe panic attacks every 30 minutes, suicidal). They recommended a hospital stay so we went to the hospital where they admitted him to voluntary inpatient. I think they told work they were out on Friday, and couldn’t help out over the weekend due to an emergency. My friend then was still in the hospital until Tuesday, texted work on Tuesday afternoon to let them know they were out, still due to an emergency and wouldn’t be in Wednesday but would be back Thursday. This morning they walked into work and immediately got told they were terminated. Didn’t ask for a note, never gave prior warnings. Apparently the nonprofit board decided this and the rest of the staff were very apologetic. Friend walked out and left bc due to mental health isn’t really in the headspace to advocate for themselves. 

Isn’t this discrimination due to a health issue? Or did my friend drop the ball by no call no show when in the hospital?

Some people say that it was an extremely positive experience and that they met people they still talk to this day, with the staff being super helpful and understanding and that they improved for the better. But other people say that their experience was terrible having to deal with a neglectful/uncaring staff and feeling like they were treated as less than human while being there. These mixed signals always fucking put me off because who the hell am I supposed to believe in this matter?

22,How to Find Normalcy After Hospitalization?,"I was let out of the Behavioral Health Hospital two days ago. This was my second stay, and I had a much shorter stay back in August. Neither stay was due to a true suicide attempt, but because I get myself into a horrible place wherein I end up in dangerous situations (my fault). 

I think this having been my second mental health-related hospitalization, I’m having a horrible time re-integrating into society.

I’m afraid of my husband, I’m afraid of my son (they’re my anxiety triggers), I can’t work, and can’t go out, because I can’t face “normal” people because I know that most of them have probably never been institutionalized, let alone twice, and I can’t look that reality in the face.

I’m having nightmares. I’ve spent the past two days in true terror of going back. Hurting myself became a habit really easily, and my biggest fear is hospitalization becoming my next habit, and later, permanent institutionalization.

I know I need to re-integrate and use the coping skills I learned to get through this, but I can’t. I am literally scared stiff. I don’t know what to do.

How do I start to find some normalcy after such a traumatic experience, and begin using my coping skills so this never happens again. I’m not going to heal, sitting alone in a room and hiding away.

I have been twiddling my thumbs more or less for 6 months.

I don't really know how to compare the quality of care of a Dallas PHP to one in better states. Reviewers of said places only know so much about what the standard for mental health care is and idek what that standard is myself but yeah that's my dilemma.

36,First time in Partial Hospitalization,"Hey guys. I just wanna write this out to anyone who happens to read this. Today is my first day checking into a partial hospital for behavioral health. I feel like I struggle day to day with my mental health and I have been ignoring it. So the doctor officially diagnosed me with anxiety and depression and once I took some meds, I somehow got a little better? I wrote that question mark because there’s still a lot of underlying unresolved issues within the deepest parts of my soul that I tuck away…. 
See, most people wouldn’t actually think I suffer through anything because I never speak up about it. I lightly talk about it but people don’t normally ask me much about it. I function properly in society yet deep down inside, there’s something that has plague my soul for what feels like my whole life. 
I’m an RN and work in a behavioral health facility with children. So yes, I have a great job and I’m a fully-fledged adult. Blending into society really well… I’ve been married for 6 years too. We have a pretty good marriage too… yet, whatever is there, is still there. That heaviness in my heart that I can’t seem to just turn off. 
Despite what I define a success (being an RN, married for a long time in a good one too), I still feel so diseased. But I don’t want to and at times I can’t understand why.
I burst into tears when all else fails, or feels like all else fails. I’m on thin ice day in and day out. But I try to keep living. I was suicidal until last year December. My feelings just overwhelmed me that killing myself was truly the logical sense to do. Lately, I have not had them.
But the idea of me having suicidal ideation and these overwhelming feelings that builds up mystifies the crap out of me.
Because even after achieving something great or being in one of the greatest relationships in life or knowing that God is with me (I really genuinely have faith), I still can’t understand why I’m having these feelings that is just too much..
So, I finally signed myself into a partial hospitalization to take the time to understand just what the heck is going on with me…

44,Is it time for hospitalization?,"
I'm concerned that hospitalization may be my only answer out of this at this point. Here is what Im experiencing that is difficult for me to express face to face in session: 


- Uncharacteristic lack of self care such as bathing and brushing teeth that causes feelings of extreme shame. Why can't I just get the fuck up?! I mean...i fucking smell bad...wtf.


- Related trashed living space


-extreme isolation


- negative angry paranoid obsessive and drawn out inner dialogue when trying to prepare to interact with others ie bosses, coworkers, mother, customers, boyfriend, doctors. ( they have a power struggle agenda)


- solid 6 weeks of seeing large bugs that aren't there which I originally thought might be a symptom of quitting meds and quitting  drinking but its still happening. 


- insomnia and messed up sleep pattern mostly characterized by not being able to sleep at night and attempting to catch up during the day (this was the biggest contributing factor to my decline and ultimate dismissal from my job) 


- uncharacteristically avoiding my children out of extreme shame: Im greasy/smelly, not providing financially, inability to communicate with them deeply or for sustained amounts of time bc I can't control my emotions...mainly crying or frustration particularly with my 5 y.o. who has some significant and worrisome behavioral and thought patterns. (Let me point out that we live with my mother who is more than adequately caring for my children in all imaginable ways while Im ill.)


- severe memory loss


In less than a year despite med mgmt and 16 ect treatments I have steadily declined to a point to where Im now barely functioning and experiencing some symptoms that are pretty disturbing and inhibiting. 


The holidays are right on top of me and Im not functioning despite many solid attempts to snap out of it and get going. I wont be able to bear it if my children miss out on Christmas bc I can't get my act together.

47,Considering a Partial Hospitalization Program,"CW: suicide

I have been struggling with chronic/clinical depression for most of the last 10 years. Lately it has been a lot worse--like the second worst episode with the first being when I almost attempted in 2019--and feel like I need extra help if I'm going to make it to the end of the year. 

I don't have any plans, but have been having suicidal feelings for over 2 months, don't sleep well, and barely have been eating. My therapist, psychiatrist, and I all agree the causes are all likely psycho-social or hormonal (I'm on hormone replacement therapy) and we are considering a partial hospitalization program (PHP). Anyone have experiences with PHP? 

I'm worried if the PHP is remote (not in-person) that I'm only going to feel even more isolated and lonely. But in-patient/full hospitalization seems too overwhelming and scary, and although I know there will be no academic/work repercussions (I'm a graduate student and teaching assistant) I am still extremely deterred by the thought of being gone for 1-2 weeks and then having to come back to a giant mess. But I also don't know if I'm making a mistake by thinking I can still keep up with all I'm doing now AND commit to a PHP. I'm afraid I'm minimizing and hiding my pain even from myself, or that I've been in it so long I can't see how bad I really am. Any thoughts/help is appreciated.

48,Post-Hospitalization Stress Disorder,"I have an oddly complex mental health history and no one I know who can help me navigate what the best course of action can be. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I have had 10+ psychiatrists and 10+ therapists in several countries and several US states, which I currently live in. My issues varied in severity over a long period of time and I have gone to extremes in my times of despair but never really tried or attempted suicide even though I have fantasized about it a lot to this day.

I feel I will never be happy so I generally like the idea of being dead than being alive and I'm sure far more people will be happy if I'm gone than unhappy, but I don't think I'll attempt suicide because I'm chained with inaction and it just seems like a really terrible idea. If I'm going to take a destructive action why does it have to be to myself?

Few years ago, due to an angry drunk escalation with my ex, I got hospitalized for several days in a psychiatric hold. The psychiatrist was trying to get me cured from alcoholism, and I was put under the hold because I'm a risk to myself. I was a young naïve person then. I wasn't even alcoholic and I got into an ego fight with the hospital's psychiatrist because I didn't see it to be the doctor's business to criticize my blood alcohol level when I'm staying at home given that he doesn't know anything else about my drinking habits. Also, given that I was shipped to the hospital against my will because the police threatened to arrest me otherwise.

This was a huge traumatic event for me. I was threatened to be arrested by four police officers at the comfort of my own home because they saw the bottle of liquor. That confirmed what they knew from the caller. They were expecting to meet a drunk angry version of me. They met it even though I don't display anger outwardly to strangers. That was enough evidence to send me to the psychiatric hold. The doctors did the same. I had a good insurance back then so they decided to extend my hospitalization. I was simply silent and awaiting release throughout my visit having known after the second day they had no intention but accumulate evidence of my sickness and not my health in this hospital.

I didn't lose faith in psychiatry yet through this. I still managed to see this as an economic altercation and that the hospital managed to rob my insurance 20-something thousand dollars for the least comfortable hostel stay with the unfriendliest staff and guests. I saw a few psychiatrists and therapists after that. Some were disturbed by my inclination to self hate and suicide (even though I learned to keep outright suicide ideation to myself only after the hospital experience), some others were wrong and tried to treat me from bipolar, psychosis, and some were good, patient and took their time to try different medications and approaches.

Early 2020, my last good psychiatrist retired. I started 2020 on great notes, but by the time he retired I was in desperate need for mental help. I got myself with a different therapist, then a different psychiatrist. This recent psychiatrist had an opinion that my hospitalization was not as accidental as I make it sound and that he has dealt with these situations before. My trauma about hospitalization started retriggering. I felt like I will be hospitalized again in my life. I know I don't want to kill myself or anyone even if I wished differently, but the thought of facing the inside of a hospital again was very terrifying.

I fought with my therapist and psychiatrist (they work in conjunction). I tried to sound as alarming as possible without any confirmation of being an imminent danger. I tried to replay the trauma. I don't understand why. I wanted to sit down inside the hospital room and tell the doctor he can't lock me up this time. I wanted to try a different route and see a different outcome. My therapist asked to call the emergency room for me again. They both cut ties with me asking me that the only support that can be given to me is in emergency rooms only. I wasn't even incessant or anything. Just too triggered for them to handle. I was frightened. My trauma is real. You will be kicked into the asylum if you dare live or think differently. If you think you're worth less than what the society can take from you, you must be insane. We must lock you up and object you to our badly tested science until you fully give in. Or maybe it's the insurance money, maybe that's why doctors will fight terminal cancers till the last second. Maybe it's the fact that if you can be sick, someone will treat you as such.

I didn't fully give up on therapy although I'm giving up on medication for a variety of reasons that relate to quality of life (the post is already long enough, medication itself is a very complex topic that I kept a good personal record of)

How can I take charge of my mental health now? I'm terrified that I had few of my therapists / psychiatrists on the record were in the forced hospitalization, or have cut their relationships with me due to that fight. I don't really have a great mental health record. Obviously, my biggest fear is that when I enter an emergency room seeking help, all my rights gets stripped off and I suddenly get treated as someone who cannot take a decision and cannot be considered seriously, and then my insurance gets milked, and another psychiatric hold is put on the record to assist as future evidence for any follow-up hospitalizations. When I get to a psychiatrist or a therapist that think I don't value myself well enough, or that they rather stop seeing me for any reason, they kick me back to the ER level which is terrible in triaging and curing the problem. It's probably just good for suicide watch.

I'm a reasonably well-off immigrant without good social ties or support. I can live OK and take care of myself and I'm absolutely in no immediate threat or stress. My questions are many, but most important are:

I can talk to a therapist telling them everything that has happened and trust them. How can I tell they actually believe my story and just not the one that's written in the hospital papers? How can I tell if they are diagnosing me for the things that I know or the things that are falsely written about me?

Can I see a therapist without telling them that I have any history so they can't make me sign any HIPPA releases with any doctors or institution names because this is my first time starting? Maybe I should tell them at that night I got arrested instead of hospitalized and that the arrest traumatized me and that I'm searching for the ways to heal from this trauma? It's really practically the same for me so I can benefit from whatever the therapists can give after such ""forceful interactions"". Would it be weird that I'm seeking therapy for the first time in my life several years after an arrest to talk about it?

Maybe I should see several (3-5) therapists, even if infrequently, telling them everything including my growing distrust in the medical establishment, and with each I'll be working on the separate issues I want to work on, so that I can leave and seek different therapists without a major disconnect, and having several multiple, rounded opinions around me at all times can help me avoid being hospitalized again.

And the most immediate need is to deal with this specific trauma of hospitalization that I keep replaying every time I feel terrible. It causes very abrasive issues to my health and daily life. My two different but important ways to think of this past trauma are:

1. How can I protect myself legally from being hospitalized again, and if hospitalized, I wouldn't be forced to take medication, and if forced, have everything well documented. Can someone flip a hospital's decision like if I have a psychiatrist on the outside diagnosing me differently? Will having a legal interference of some sort be possible to absolve me from unnecessary hospitalizations (which are all the hospitalizations in my case)?

50,Im scared of doctors/hospitals ,"Hi, writing out this post is pretty embarrassing for me especially since I havent really told anyone this before but im terrified of doctors and hospitals. Whenever i have to go to the doctor i have to drag my mum along with me, im 19. I can make my own appointments fine, its just being there that freaks me out. My dad died of cancer in hospital when I was about 14, leading up to that a good 60% of my life was spent in hospitals, doctors and medical settings for my dad. I remember hating all of it, sitting in waiting rooms for hours, all of the tubes sticking in and out of his face, never hearing any good news, seeing all these other sick or dying people, so many people crying, I think it really effected me. I havent been back to a hospital since he died, even walking past one makes me nervous. Hell I’m even tearing up typing abt this. I used to have to be physically dragged to the doctor, which Ive gotten over now, but the fear is still there. Usually my mum has to hold my hand and sometimes answer questions for me cause I just cant bring myself to speak. I feel so embarrassed, Im an adult and I should be able to do this myself but I just cant do it. Sometimes if I need a script repeat on my meds ill go for weeks without them because just thinking of going to the doctors makes me too nervous to book an appointment, which just makes my whole life worse until I can get them again. I know its bad, I dont know what to do. I’m planning on moving out with my gf this year, so I need to figure this out, I cant force my mum to appointments with me if I dont even live with her. I’m worried that I’ll just put off going all together out of fear, and I cant let that happen, im sick of prioritising my fear over my own health. If anyone has any sort of advice it would be highly appreciated. Or even if you experience something similar, id like to hear about it

I’m 15 years old and I am so fucking tired. I know it’s a crazy thing to want, but I wish I could have it. Just a moment of recognition that I am barely surviving and I need help. Yes, I am self destructive. I see getting worse as a challenge. My parents will tell me that I should be happy I’m not struggling with ___ and I’ll take it as a challenge to start struggling with it. I will do ANYTHING to get the help or validation I need. I know it’s strange and dumb but I don’t know what to do. I’m so deep in the self destructive pit that being told I seem happier or better is a sign for me to make everything worse again.

55,"""Ugliness survey"" at the hospital exacerbated my body dysmorphia","I'm a 30 year old woman. I've struggled with body dysmorphia since childhood, mostly fixating on my nose (which has a bump and is crooked, so there is what you might call a ""real"" issue) as well as a general sort of ugliness that I cannot specifically place.   


This past summer I was hospitalized for anorexia and once I was transferred from inpatient to outpatient, they enrolled me in a few group therapies. One of the nurses in the program had me email her photos of my face from different angles and distributed these photos to ten anonymous staff members at the hospital, and asked them to answer questions like, ""How ugly is this person out of 10?"" or ""How much does this person's nose ruin their face?"" and so on. We wrote the questions together.  


Before she did this exposure I expressed multiple times that I feared I would be at risk of self-harming upon seeing the results, and that I really did not want to do it. I asked if I could opt out and she said yes but continued to bring it up and ask me why I wouldn't do it until I eventually agreed.   


The results came in and were varied. A couple people rated me a ""10"" for beauty, others a ""4."" More than half said that my nose does in fact ruin my face (ratings of 6-10 out of 10).   


These results were very distressing to me, less because of the numbers themselves and more so because I felt coerced into doing the exposure and because there was no follow up or after care. The nurse read me the results, gave me the ""raw data"" and excused me from her office. This was in July, it's mid-October now, and I am still struggling with this information.  


This is of course not the ""cause"" of my dysmorphia, but I'm feeling unable to get past what feels like confirmation of my ugliness. I have trouble leaving my apartment or working while my partner is home because I fear he will look at me and see how ugly I am. It is disrupting my every day. I am in therapy with a general counsellor and also a trauma therapist, so two sessions a week, and I don't seem to be getting anywhere with the BDD. I also research it and read studies and articles about the disorder to try to better understand it. I consider myself in most ways a very reasonable, giving, dedicated person, friend, and partner, but I am so totally fixated on my ugliness sometimes that I fear I will drive others away.  


I guess I am asking two things: 1. Is there any hope for dysmorphic patients? I haven't felt like I've made any progress over the 12 or so years of therapy, and 2. Is this kind of exposure experiment normal?  


Thanks very much in advance for any insight.

I’m in contact with his father, who he is close to. His father took him to the ER, and agreed to keep me updated on any information, especially since my partner won’t have access to contacting me. We’ve talked a bit, just letting each other know we’re doing a good job in supporting him and that this is a good decision and that we are both glad he is getting the help he needs.
What can I do to support him and his father during this time? I don’t have many resources, but I want to make sure I’m saying the right things and helping where I can to make it easier for them both and let them know I’m supportive.

58,Aftermath of psychiatric hospitalization,"Tl;dr being involuntarily hospitalized traumatized me and I went from a smart student to a crazy person with serious problems and lost a part of myself. 

I had to get this out there because I don't think anyone in my life understands. 

About a month ago I had a mental breakdown at school. During the week prior, I was struggling with suicidal thoughts. Every single night I contemplated overdosing on my meds. I talked to anyone and everyone I confided in because I knew that it was getting bad. There was an exam that Friday that I was not prepared for. I barely passed the last exam so I knew I would fail this one. Right before the exam, I had a class. During class, I was thinking about how I would fail the exam and how I had to go to work for a 7 hour shift after even though all I wanted to do was sleep my troubles away. That morning when I really wished I wouldn't wake up and was angry that I did. My brain told me that I could still OD so that I wouldn't have to go to work. It was that point when I realized that I was having a mental breakdown and I didn't have the mental capacity to take the exam. I texted my friend because she understood what I was going through, having mental illnesses herself and I emailed my counselor for some resources or people I could talk to so that I can figure out how to manage my course load. My friend told some library staff about my message (we have a really close relationship with them) and they called the security to check in on me. The problem was that I was in class so they stopped the class to talk to my professor. He forgot to turn the mic off and unintentionally revealed that I had depression. After that I just had a panic attack for the rest of class. I ended up getting an excused absence for the exam and went to go talk to my counselor. I spent about 3-4 hours in his office with him trying to get me to go to the hospital and me refusing to go. He got my friend involved because I didn't have a car and after all that, I finally agreed to go because it was either I go voluntarily or he was going to call the ambulance so I really had no way out of it. My friend had a telehealth appt with her doctor so we were going to go after. I decided to take a nap but I had so much anxiety that I just needed to talk to someone. So I sneaked out of my room to go talk to one of the library staff. I was actually prepared to hide from my friend to avoid going to the hospital. Somehow my counselor saw me and thought that I was running away. He found me talking to the library staff and we had another chat. In the end, we compromised on me going to a behavioral health urgent care that recently opened up. He actually walked me to my room to get my insurance card because he thought I would run away again. After about an hour or 2 at the urgent care, they told me I couldn't leave and they had to admit me. So I went through all this trouble just to end up with the obvious outcome. 

I spent 5 days in the psych ward. I hated the first 3 days because I didn't want to be there but slowly accepted it. I slept pretty much all day because there was nothing to do and I didn't want to watch TV. Their group therapy was just playing games with a group and there really was no therapy at all. The doctor spent at most 5 minutes just asking questions and seeing how you were doing and I saw the social worker once. The food was really bad and it was annoying having the nurse check in on you every 15 minutes and waking you up at 6 am to take vitals. But overall compared to other stories, I had a better experience. Everyone was ""normal,"" just struggling with their mental illnesses like I was. There was no isolation or restraints (or rather it wasn't needed) but it was just so boring. Every morning I would wake up and just think another day of doing nothing. There was no doctor on the weekend so when I arrived there I didn't see anyone and I thought I would never get out of there.  But I have to admit it was nice just being away from social media and rest of the world and not having to worry about school. I was put on another medication which made me really shaky and had really bad tremor in my hands. On the last day I was there I had HR of 122 even though I wasn't doing anything. It was so bad that on the first day I went back to work I was shaking so much that I couldn't type, write or do anything. 

So one month out from the psych ward, my mood's been better and I haven't had any suicidal thoughts. When I first got out I had so much anxiety that I couldn't be around people and couldn't stay in the dorms by myself so I've been staying with my friends. I dropped 2 electives (I was taking 18 credit hours before), quit an on campus job and got my hours reduced at work. I'll be making up my exams during finals week, so everything's all better right? 

I feel like I lost a part of myself at the hospital. Every single day and night my brain replays that week over and over again. What if I had run away? What if I didn't tell anyone and OD'ed? Everywhere I go on campus it reminds me of what happened. When I walk to my room, it feels like my counselor is next to me, making sure I don't run away. I remember most of the conversation, word for word. And it just causes so much anxiety and sadness. When I'm with my friends, it just stops at the memory. But when I'm by myself in my room, it spirals down to more complex thoughts that I know will eventually lead to suicidal thoughts. 

I'm happy to be with my friends. They've been really supportive and taking care of me. So why do I feel so empty inside? I would often stare into space and feel sad. I study and try to do well in my classes just like before but I don't care about my grades anymore. I go through the actions of my normal self but it means nothing to me. The future still seems bleak and I'm not good enough to achieve my goals. I laugh and truly feel happy around my friends but I feel like I've crossed a line where they don't understand me anymore. No one knows what it's like being in a psych ward. The moment they took me in a wheelchair from the urgent care with the security next to me, I felt defeated, powerless and helpless. I felt humiliated when they strip searched me and took everything, even my hairband away. My friend actually held my arm yesterday and I couldn't handle it because I felt so restrained. I hated myself for getting in this mess and felt like everyone was against me, banded together to put me in a psych ward. I truly felt like I'm crazy enough to be put in a psych ward. I went from being a smart student in the top 15% of the class to a crazy person with serious problems. I look at everyone and think 'you will never understand me.'  I don't know if I can truly open up to anyone again. If I can look for help when I'm suicidal and tell someone I'm close to losing it. If I can be honest and true to my feelings. When the people who know about the psych ward ask me how I'm doing, I say I'm better. But I'm not. Even at the lowest of my lows it was better than this because I was myself. 

&#x200B;

Every day I wish I could just be locked away forever. Being a socially awkward introvert among strangers with similar problems and  not deal with the world anymore. I may not be suicidal but it doesn't mean I want to live.

77,Wellstone Regional Hospital,"If you know this hospital then you know. If you don’t, I’m about to tell you what happened to me a year ago when I stepped foot within that establishment.

At first I thought it was welcoming. The food and amenities were amazing but it did not make up for the horrible treatments I had to go through.

I was in there for severely mutilating my left arm and anxiety with issues regarding to handling my emotions. For the first two days I was “punished” for wanting to read my book rather than watching “inside out,” a movie I’ve seen for the 7th time with my siblings at home. They didn’t let me go to “the gym/recess” aka the only time we’d be allowed to move around freely. They said I didn’t participate. That nearly made me cry because I was already bored out of my mind and slowly descending to insanity because being in there already made me missed a lot of lessons (I was taking honor classes as well.) That and I have heavy traumas with “punishments” because I used to be berated to the point of not wanting to make a mistake and forsaken my own well being to keep that perfect image. So I was dealing with a lot of anxiety but then I heard from another kid, far younger than me, that they’ve been there twice, that I could get out in a day or two if I act happy. I was stubborn because I genuinely wanted them to look into me and see what was wrong. But that’s not what they did. They just made me sign a paper that said “I’ll be safe” as if that paper will resuscitate me if I fucking stab myself with a needle. I was assigned a doctor but she didn’t ask much other than how was my day. I don’t know how that would help with the diagnosing process. And then I was assigned, not a licensed psychologist, but a social worker. She did not hold the family session she promised. And 3 days became 4 days, and then… it was a week. At some point the person I shared a room with had to leave and I was left alone. I didn’t want to be  alone and after 20 minutes of crying, a 14 year old girl came over and told the nurse I definitely have anxiety whether they would like to follow that diagnosis or not and that they should arrange me a new roommate because it is what I requested and not for their shitty story (yes the nurse did go on a rant about how she moved out at 16 and became independent) was oh-so-better than me. Being a lone in a dark room in a strange hospital with a bathroom that doesn’t have a door creeps me out a lot. The bed wasn’t that comfortable either and the blanket was thin. And of course, I have traumas with the dark as well. As that’s where I feel the most unsafe unless there’s another living breathing person next to me. Not someone from the outside walking in every 15 minutes, but a person just as vulnerable as me, sleeping and helping me feel safe. Crazy how the presence of another girl made me feel safer than a registered nurse. And I felt compelled to let a dude there know the best way to bleed out. And the best part was? Nobody stopped me. Every kids there was just as done and as unhinged as the nurses. (This was already on my seventh day so I was done, please don’t come after me for giving that dude the advice.) Except I would rather ask for the kids’ help.

My school promised they’d send me the work I’d missed too but surprise surprise they didn’t. 

Tdlr: everyone in my life failed me and I hope enough reviews come bombarding in Southern Indiana’s Wellstone Regional Hospital that they’d get inspected and shut down. 

Especially for kids that aren’t as outspoken as me, they will bully the fuck out of those kids and feed off of that. I was judged many times for wanting to read my books rather than participating in activities that kindergartners partake in.  

Here’s my advice for those who wants to go to a mental hospital.

82,Ex-friends hospital just called me again,"Honestly, not sure if this is the right sub but wanted to vent and ask people who might have more experience in these matters. I don't want to put this load on anyone in my life.

As the title says, an ex-friend that I've been in no contact with put me as next-of-kin, in his inpatient psychiatric hospital.

I don't want to say too much about his condition, because it's not my story and honestly I don't know how much is true (edit: I know he was diagnosed with schizophrenia ) so I want to keep this post as factual as I can. I will put  \*when I type my feelings or perspective, just to make it clearer.

There were a few incidents last year, but we had a major falling out a few months ago when he was making accusations. (not the first time on the receiving end). I realize that it might have been his mental illnesses but \*honestly it just got too much and I reached my break point.

TLDR version, we stopped being friends and I've blocked him on all socials.

2-weeks ago: Got a call, from his hospital (They did call his ex-wife too) and I politely said I didn't want to speak about him and that we have been NC for months. I don't know anything about his condition and I'm not interested to know.

Last week: got an email from a new address saying""We aren't family anymore, and we are done"" etc.  I promptly blocked it, without responding.  \*because to me we stopped being family when he said he didn't want to be friends with me multiple times....over multiple events.

Today: Got called again.  I mentioned the previous call, no contact. I asked why they called me again.  He put me as ""next-of-kin"". The lady asked if she could just know when we ""broke up"", so I told her we didn't ""break up"" and that we were just close friends until last year when he started having mental health issues.

\*She sounded a bit surprised by this so I'm not sure what he told them, and I don't think I want to know anymore. I don't want to care anymore.

I asked her to take me off the list and told her I didn't want to be contacted again.

\*\*Now, I'm sitting at work and my mind and emotions are in a bit of turmoil. I know I did the right thing for my mental health but part of me feels guilty for not ""being there"". I'm trying to remind myself that he is not my responsibility...and I can't ""save him"" even if I want to.  I do not have the bandwidth or the energy to ""help"" him in any way or support him through his mental health issues anymore.

\*\*Part of me is angry that he gave them my number to the hospital when he knows we are NC.  It feels manipulative like he is trying to get a reaction and using the hospital for it.

I (24f) have been dealing with mental health issues ever since I can remember (anxiety/depression, I also have adhd and I suspect I may be bipolar), but the last 1/3 of 2022 has been extremely overwhelming and chaotic for me.

Nothing really…bad happened. It seemed to just be going up for me for a while—I started a new job as a pharmacy tech in September and started dating my current bf shortly after I began. We started spending a lot of time with each other. Whenever we both had a day off, we were together. 

I was holding down two jobs for a while; the other was at a supermarket. I left the supermarket job because I was getting overwhelmed with working too much and my schedule was a morning shift, which was total opposite of the pharmacy tech job. While this was all happening I was trying to find an apartment to move into with my friend but I’ve just been too broke to move out of my parents house so she found a place by herself (and I feel terrible because she was under the impression that I’d help her with rent and I didn’t speak up).

My bf lost his job about a month ago, so lately he has tons of free time and he wants to see me whenever I’m not working or when he’s not going to a concert with his friends. Between seeing him and the tech job all the time, I’ve been overwhelmed, struggling with my meds, struggling with sleep, struggling with impulsively spending money…I’ve been falling off the rails. And the thing is deep down I don’t really want to be a pharmacy tech, I want to write for a living but it’s just been too hard to find gigs and I have bills to pay so I’ve been pursuing other careers.

I’m making careless mistakes at my job and I’ve been having impulsive thoughts to steal drugs and idk if I trust myself not to follow through. So I decided I’m leaving my job and doing a partial program. I know my bf is supportive of me prioritizing my mental health but I’m not sure if he really knows what that entails. I’m…just really hoping my bf won’t think my time off will mean we can spend every waking moment with each other. I’d like to spend time with him a few days out of the week after partial but I really would like time to decompress some days. I’m also worried a bit about him being disappointed about our sex life because we usually have sex late at night after his parents go to bed since he still lives at home (and there’s no way he could come over my place).

After the divorce, I took Vyvanse to focus on work and thought I had a type of Adult Add. At first, I was very focused at work recording very high levels of performance. It started after work I would hear my co-worker's voices when I got home from the office. It gradually grew into hearing persecutory voices all the time of co-workers and friends I grew up with. I isolated because I interpreted the voices as some sort of government technology. I developed this complicated delusional storyline during the Obama administration. It has taken me close to 15 years to realize definitely that the voices and my mental state are a result of mental illness. When you hear this type of interference and eschew thinking it is very difficult to see your own circuits as faulty. It seems to be put there by an outside force. I was sure it was a government trial program of some sort. After these episodes, I go through periods of normalcy and besides an antidepressant, I'm healthy and don't consider myself mentally ill. I'm having problems understanding what my diagnosis is or should be. After a hospitalized episode a therapist diagnosed me with a type of Schizoaffective disorder, then My psychiatrist completely disagreed and said its on the Bipolar Spectrum. Since it completely goes away the voices and paranoid thinking I'm leaning towards the Bipolar disorder.

94,Unpopular opinion: The laws regarding involuntary hospitalization,"I haven't seen anyone involuntarily hospitalize someone who has a contagious disease until recently. I know they have began hospitalizing patients with covid-19. People became very upset at this. However, those same people don't think about what we go through as mental health patients. The history of  involuntary hospitalization in my state tells a story that it was never truly meant to help the patient. It was meant to help society control that person.

Some of us are held on four point, yelled at, treated poorly, and cursed out. The law enforcement and the vulnerable adult protective services don't handle the situation justly when it gets bad. I had my hair pulled out purposely by the behavioral techs twice. Some of us spend the rest of our lives in these hospitals even if we never really hurt someone so gravely that they were near death or worse. Some hospitals are worse than others and when the person enacting the involuntary hospitalization gets mad they prefer to send you to the one that they know is worse for things like refusing to speak to them.

You end up getting worse because of the trauma. People can easily make up things about you and send you to the hospital where the psychiatrist and their staff will believe such lies because you were sent their previously. Even if you were never sent there previously 9/10 the hospital will believe the person who is making things up. There should be more laws and concrete evidence in the courtroom to protect people from such a thing happening to them. An ex-parte should include the accused party in the courtroom just like any other judicial process. The only difference with this law is that people consider you guilty before you even have a chance to speak.

My room is a disaster and my grades are too (this is VERY out of character as I am a straight A student). I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts and different things of that sort too.

I want to possibly talk to a doctor and see if a mental hospital is a good idea to possibly help me. However I have a few questions about it that I thought I may ask before:

How long do stays last?
How is school/grades affected?
Am I simply overreacting and just lazy?

I have no clue what to do and I feel like I have just sunk. Would a mental hospital or something like that be helpful?",1704775566.0,False,1,0,WorldlyGas3597,None,1926ct6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1926ct6/mental_hospitalsadmitting_yourself/
99,At what point should you seriously consider hospitalization,"I posted a few days ago for the first time and since then I've spiralled a lot in such a short time.

I've been in bed from Saturday to Monday, yesterday I felt a bit better but 15 minutes ago I was fighting extreme urges to commit suicide. I was sat in bed for almost an hour holding a knife to either my wrists or throat and endlessly crying trying to justify my suicide. 

I already have my first counselling appointment booked for 2 weeks time. 

The one thing stopping me is that it will absolutely ruin any chances I have of pursuing the career I want, even though the counselling alone could do that.

Edit: it's been nearly a day since I posted this and I'm feeling like a lot less of a risk to myself. I've decided not to go to a hospital and I'll be mentioning it in the counselling and I'll see where it goes from there.

100,Will being in a psychiatric hospital ruin my life?,"If I was put in a mental hospital, would I be able to go to school, college, get a job, and live a normal life? Also would I have access to my phone?

I’m 14 and maybe a mental health issue. I don’t have a therapist because my problem is kind of directed towards my parents and I don’t want them to know. So I’ve talked to people online but I feel like a burden and I think I probably scare them or something so I don’t really want to say the specific issue but it has something to do with violent thoughts and just overall hatred and anger.

If I talked to a therapist, I also feared that they might put me in a mental hospital. But I just want to live a good like so I’ve been trying my best to do good in school and trying to get a job. My issue still persists but I am able to just ignore it and so far it hasn’t harmed me or anyone else. 

So should I just risk it and try to wait 4 years until I move out?

101,Hospital admission,"My hospital admission is coming to an end on Friday. I was admitted early August after a suicide attempt.

I haven’t told the doctor out of fear of being moved to high observation, but it’s irrelevant as he says I’m getting discharged Friday whether or not I am good or safe to go and said that I would need to go back to the emergency room if I needed any help.

111,Long term hospitalization,"All of my life I have struggled really badly with anxiety and depression. When I was younger I struggled with substance abuse. I spent a year in rehab treatment when I was younger. I got clean but did not really get help for my underlying psychiatric issues. 
I'm still sick I just don't use. I never found any solace in the 12 step programs and never felt right and felt out of place there. 

I went to college and a really hard graduate school and academically did well but my depression and anxiety got out of control. I drank a lot and gained a huge amount of weight and developed a sleep disorder. I started taking a lot of risks and would do anything just to escape my anxiety. My anxiety got worse and worse. 

After I graduated I felt burnt out and incredibly anxious and I've never been able to start or manage my career. I hate what I do and want to change but i took on so much debt. I have incredible anxiety and freak out and feel suicidal at work so I haven't been working. 

Now I am broke, uninsured, living with a parent, no car, no job. I have sunk into a giant depression. I can't afford therapy. I have a psychiatrist I see who is trying different meds but none have really helped much. What I am on now just leaves me loopy and tired and im still anxious and very depressed. 

I still go see her and tell her but I get very little time with her and i dont have a lot of faith there. I will keep going to see her and taking meds as prescribed because i know i am supposed to. My family has a lot of problems and pressure and I feel like i put a huge burden on them and my girlfriend with my problems and how i am. 

I need serious help for my depression and especially for my anxiety. I can't function. I have panic attacks going anywhere or trying to drive or do basic things. I have trouble getting through a single day. Working seems impossible and I feel huge amounts of guilt over that. 

But I want to get help, I just think I need long term inpatient care. But I am broke and uninsured and unsure how to find it. Maybe such a thing doesnt exist for someone broke and uninsured, i don't know, it probably doesn't. When I try searching online I only end up finding places that cost a lot of money.

114,I was admitted to the Mental Hospital,"Sup,


So, I found myself in a medical joint known for dealing with folks who'd partied too hard with substances or were wrestling with their inner voices.


This one day felt like a scene straight out of a horror movie. I was just wandering the halls, trying to kill time, when suddenly, this guy starts freaking out. It was intense—he had this wild look in his eyes, like he was fighting off some invisible monster only he could see, and he was screaming ""LET ME GO!"" at the top of his lungs. His voice was so filled with fear, it bounced off the walls and made everyone freeze and just stare. It was as if the air turned heavy, like before a storm hits, and you could feel the tension everywhere.

The nurses, who are usually pretty chill, jumped into action like they were characters in some dark, twisted game, moving towards him with this super serious vibe they had going on. To someone just passing by, it might've looked like they deal with this kind of drama all the time, but there was this vibe that something really bad could happen. You could half-joke that they were taking him to some secret room for a time-out, but nope, they actually took him to this place they call the ""safe room."" It's meant to be a spot where you can just take a breath and chill, but with the heavy mood, it felt more like a quiet corner in a haunted house where you're left alone with your thoughts.

Honestly, it was a reminder of how real and close to the edge things can get in a place like this, and it made the whole ""healing"" vibe of the facility feel a bit more complicated. It's weird how a place meant to pull you out of the darkness sometimes feels like it's got shadows of its own.",1709768762.0,False,2,0,Lezzdoit77,None,1b8f9bx,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1b8f9bx/i_was_admitted_to_the_mental_hospital/

120,A close friend is currently at the hospital...,"...and will stay there for at least 2 months.

This is what I know: He has been at the psychiatric department for 3 days. Was diagnosed with OCD and I'm not sure if esquizofrenia... Weights only 45kg and is currently extremely apatic because of the medicines he's taking... 40 yold... No wife, no kids...

Nurses told family that he cannot have tablets, mobile phones or laptops, and from what I've understood he just lays there during the entire day... He is also not a gamer, but already played some games in the past.

I would like to propose to them a game console without internet connection capabilities, but I'm just not sure if it is something that I should do... Not only because the family seems to be anti gaming but also because I think the personnel from the hospital does not know such a device exists...

I have 2 nintendo game and watch, one with super Mario games, another with Zelda games... And this is what I'm thinking on giving him for use during his recovery. They are stand alone devices without wireless communication...

I would like to hear some advice in this situation... Since I just don't want to do anything that could be harmful for anyone.

Thank you.

121,My experience in a mental hospital,"My first and only child was 3 months old... I was held in there for 6 days involuntary. 
I was super depressed and felt unworthy to be this beautiful humans mother. I was alone for the first time after giving birth and decided to take the opportunity to commit suicide. I changed my mind after sitting in our backyard with the gun for about 30 minutes. I told my husband as he just came home from work. He was devastated and called his mother - and they decided to call the mobile crisis hotline...
So, I suppose my family did what they thought was best. But here's how it went, and it was the worst experience I've had in my life. 
There was at least 8 police officers in my home. They took me to the local ER where I was kept in a closet sized room (door left open because I wasn't allowed to be left alone...) stripped of all of my personal clothing and items. The bright hospital lights blaring on me all night long - I could not get any sleep as I was expected to. I was so miserable and missed my baby so badly. 
After at least 24 hours in the ER waiting for an opening at the Mental Hospital I finally got escorted to the ambulance there... 
They were all very nice at the mental hospital aside from the actual psychiatric evaluator - he did not give any genuine signs that he cared for his patients or wanted to take the time to hear our stories... just wanted us to be medicated.  The showers and beds were very jail like - thin mattresses...metal shower where you have to push a button to keep the water going. 
It was hard to see most everyone around me so heavily medicated...even one lady was nodding off in group and moving her mouth open and shut like it felt weird to move her mouth? It was triggering because I grew up seeing my mother high on opioids... 

I also believe mental facilities take advantage of these situations to make as much money as they possibly can. I was there a lot longer than was necessary. I don't just say that by being biased either. After 3 days I felt a lot better and was in a better mindset. And it turns out the medication they put me on had me shaking and feeling dizzy (caused me to have high blood pressure...) so that's just great.

So. All this being said, I absolutely do not recommend calling mobile crisis hotline...I do recommend calling the suicide hotline if you're thinking of committing suicide. 

Oh. And seeing my daughter after just 6 days was so heartbreaking for me. It felt like forever. And she was so much bigger and more developed. She could move her head more and look around more...I was so saddened. I felt like that time was stolen from me.

125,CAMH - My Experience in a Mental Hospital,"I'm 21M and I live in Toronto. I've been to CAMH (an incredible hospital for mental health and addiction) four times, three last year and once this year. 

I read a lot of horror stories on here and comments about people discouraging others from going to hospitals when in crisis, and I in no way mean to discredit anyone's experiences, but I thought it might be helpful for someone who's thinking of going and lives in Ontario or even Canada. 

Not to get too much into my personal life, but I was sexually and physically abused as a child by my father growing up, and just stated to come to terms with it last year. This sent me into a depressive episode full of suicidal ideation and self-harm, leading to my therapist calling emergency services on me and then bringing me to CAMH. 

What to expect:
If you're brought by emergency services, they'll have to wait with you until a nurse can bring you into the main waiting room, if you admit yourself, you talk to the front desk at emerg, sit for a bit, get brought into a small room and basically get interviewed on why you're here, if they think it warrants being in the actual emergency room, they'll let you go through. Once you're in the actual emergency waiting room, it's a waiting game. A nurse will talk to you within a few hours and ask you more questions about why you're here, a doctor will then do the same. The doctor is the one that determines whether or not you get admitted to inpatient.

This process has taken me from 6-26 hours. It all depends on if they have any beds available. They bring you a cot to sleep on in the waiting room if you choose to stay and wait for a bed to open up. 

Some people have stayed in emerg for a few days, but from my experience, if you need somewhere safe to stay, they'll find you a bed. If you don't feel safe being anywhere outside of hospital and you communicate that, from my experience, you can stay in the waiting room for a long time. They also give you the option of leaving and coming back the next day when beds might be free in inpatient. 

I've only been admitted to the CCC6 floor and the CYU floor. Both were incredible, full of nurses and support workers that are working so hard to make sure you feel safe in hospital. Meals are three times a day and snack twice a day. There's groups throughout the weekdays and the weekends are fairly boring. You'll see a doctor most days who will check on your progress, adjust medication, and assist with diagnosis. There's also social workers, nutritionists, and pharmacists, who will all help you get the care you need. 

Some people are there for a couple days and others a couple months. They won't push you to leave if you don't feel safe to. Once you do leave, your doctor will go over any plans you made with them or the other staff, my doctor set me up with a psychologist who I see once a month. They can also help with finding a job/EI or a place to live. 

Overall, it's a place that I feel safe to go when I'm in crisis, and I strongly encourage you to do the same. I've heard stories from other patients about other hospitals where the treatment was less kind and warm, and they weren't allowed many or any of their possessions.

131,Can you please tell me about your experiences being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital?,"Hello, I hope you're doing well. The reason for this post is that I (25F) have an immense amount of traumas that I haven't been able to cope with. Currently, I'm not attending psychological or psychiatric therapy, but several years ago I was prescribed medication by a psychiatrist, and it helped me a lot, but I think I've gotten worse than that time, I even hace new and strong traumas. Right now, I'm not taking anything. Today (and a couple of times throughout this years) I've thought about hospitalizing myself in a psychiatric hospital. I once talked to one of my closest friends about it, and she told me that it wasn't the best decision because there's a high statistical rate of patient rape in those places (I'm mexican, here in Mexico there are very few mental health centers that are actually safe but they are really expensive). 

Regarding my experiences with traumas, since I was very young, I've lived through parental negligence due to my parents being alcoholics, and this led me to different situations that marked me for life. For example, seeing my dad and mom drunk from a very young age, being aware of my parents' alcoholism at a young age, and carrying my dad up the stairs to prevent him from falling because he fell several times. At the age of 11, I had alcohol poisoning because access to alcohol in my house was very easy. That day I almost died, and they didn't take me to the hospital. They had told me that the reason they didn't take me was due to money, but now that I'm 25 years old, I realize that it's because it would have put them at risk of losing me for obvious reasons. I also started going to clubs and getting so drunk that I would become unconscious at the age of 15. We used to go on vacation and during those trips, my sister and I would go to clubs alone. I was 15 years old, she was 17, and I was raped on three occasions by three different people. Once at the age of 15 or 16, precisely on one of these trips while I was practically unconscious. At 16 and 17 by another person, and at 18, on my birthday, by my partner. 

Let's add that I lived with my parents for a long time until just three years ago when I moved out, and throughout my life, I witnessed how they would get drunk daily and be violent with each other, and that was very traumatic for me. Therefore, due to these family experiences, including the rapes I went through, I isolated myself from people and became a hermit, and I feel a lot of anxiety about leaving the house. The day I told my parents that I was raped, they re-victimized me, telling me that it wasn't rape and that it was my fault. And that's how it's been ever since I told them. They haven't supported me, they've never asked me how I am, nothing. They've never come close to ask me anything about it, and they continue to re-victimize me, saying things like 'a man goes only as far as a woman allows.' The other day, I even talked to my dad about the experiences I had at home due to their alcoholism, and he told me that if I had alcohol poisoning at the age of 11, it was my responsibility, not theirs, and that my sister and I going to clubs and drinking that way when we were so young wasn't their fault because teenagers do whatever they want, and there's no way to control them. 

Lately, for several months, I've been feeling very depressed. Actually, it was around 2017 or a little earlier that I started experiencing depression. In 2018, I fell into the worst depression possible, and I haven't been able to recover from it. This was precisely due to an experience at home because of my parents' alcoholism. I don't feel motivated to do anything, I feel extremely mentally tired, and I don't want to live. And while, as I mentioned, I'm not undergoing psychological or psychiatric therapy, I feel that's not going to be enough anymore, and I need to be in a place where I'm encouraged to do different things – move, wake up, get out of bed, eat – because I can't do that anymore, I don't have the strength to do it. I would like you to talk to me about this. I would like you to share your experiences of being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital, if possible, and tell me which psychiatric hospital you were in and how much it cost.

135,Intensive outpatient program vs partial hospitalization program? Alexandria VA area,"Hi I was wondering if anyone has experience with either of these programs? All advice and recommendations welcome. My mental health has reached a point where I think I need to be making it my main priority and getting back on medication and in therapy. I have done weekly therapists before and it hasn’t been enough and the idea of a structured program sounds like it will be extremely beneficial to me and help me turn my life around. I have struggled with severe depression and anxiety for the last decade or so and have tried antidepressants etc but have been quick to give up when I found they weren’t working and my suicidal thoughts/ideation as of lately have been much more difficult to control and more active rather than passive, which is obviously scary. I also struggle with panic attacks and could potentially have another mood disorder or something else. I called a helpline today and the lady also mentioned looking into ketamine treatment if anyone has experience with that. Also I am not employed at the moment and think it’s a great opportunity to really focus on my mental health that I’ve overlooked far too much and make a change. 

My other question is: do you think this will all be done via telehealth/video because of COVID-19? It has made everything so much more difficult.

149,Bipolar-> First Hospitalization,"I strongly feel the need to share this anonymously. I recently admitted myself for a bipolar episode and subsequent exhaustion. I’m in the psych ward now. Here is how I arrived-

Some context is needed. Bipolar and schizophrenia have deep roots in my family system. I personally ordered a 5150 hold on my cousin last week; twice. On the other side of the family my uncle and grandpa were criminally insane with bipolar delusions. My grandma drank herself to death in her 40s.

Now to the story. 

My cousin is drawn to the hood when he’s in an episode, because he can talk and tease with people on the streets and it’s much more socially acceptable to just chat and hang out on the street. The only problem was that this particular part of the street was run by the bloods- I’ll leave out the specific set for safety reasons. Long story short, my cousin was shot (grazed?) in the back of the head for calling someone a bitch while shooting dye on this same street. He is alive and well.

I’ve had escalating mania with some delusions, but driving into Watts to get my cousins stuff forced me to suppress those bubbling feelings while also staying hyper vigilant. 

I was able to get the stuff, but immediately broke down thereafter. I had my first panic attack while crying and i could feel myself clawing at the edges of my own psyche. Delusions, mania, confusion, insomnia etc.
I voluntarily admitted myself with the support of my friends.

Anyway, safe and sound now. Seroquil is a hell of a drug.

152,Sister missing in Mental Hospital how do I find her?,"Hi so my sister (31f) seemed to have had a break down and now we can’t seem to locate her. And idk what to do. She’s never had any sever mental illnesses, besides depression and slight anxiety. 

So my sister and I (29f) live together and this past month she was having a hard time at her job. After a week of discussing with her I convinced her to quit if it was causing to much stress on her. I told her I’d cover her part of her rent, and we could go out and celebrate her leaving a stressful job. 

So after a few days of her being home from leaving her job, she started acting a bit strange. She asked me to sell our cat because she was going to heaven soon. And then out of no where she started saying she didn’t know who I was and when I started approaching her she literally ran out of the house. Confused on what happened I ran after her. As I was running after her she was yelling random religious stuff, such as “repent and the world is coming to an end, everyone needs to repent”. After causing a scene and getting peoples attention she started saying I was stalking her and abusing her! At this point I didn’t know what to do so I called 911. 

I explained everything to the dispatcher and the cops who took her. They told me they would take her to a mental hospital. This is where the problems start getting worse.

So besides being super scared, worried, and confused about what had happened, I now was terrified I called the cops on my sister. So the cop who helped me gave me an address to where she was being taken to, so naturally I went the next day and they told me there was no one there by my sisters name. I don’t know if they released her, took her to a different hospital, or are not willing to tell me any information about her because she claims she doesn’t know me. 

I’ve called the police station and explained what they told me and they reassured me they took her and she was no longer in their possession. I’ve gone back and forth with different the mental hospital and police station and they are now telling me they can’t tell me much more because of hippa violations. I am just concerned for my sister, what if she was released and out there by herself. I’ve looked online for any type of help and I can’t find anything. Some places say she has to stay 72 hours, others say she can be let go if she’s not a threat to her self. I am scared shes masked what ever she is going through or they won’t think she isn’t going through anything because she looks normal and sounds normal. I also may be over thinking everything, I just don’t know what to do. How do I get information on her? 

I don’t know if this matters but we have a national holiday on the day she will hit the 72 hours, does this matter? Does she get released or does is move to the next business day?

i tend to overshare alot, often without meaning to or talking very bluntly about serious stuff and im afraid ive overshared to so many workers.. it hits me almost every day that they could see what i said and think i should be sent.

i am not fit for those places, in the sense of yes, i am ""material"" to be sent there but i myself really dont want to for a ton of reasons. i do not think it would help me but i know that not everyone always has a choice when they get sent and that terrifies me.

i have a history of an attempt at a young age, a massive self harm history, a massive history on witnessing my parents try to end their own lives/talk about it and i feel my personality and thoughts give them even more of a reason to some fucked doctor that ""maybe i should be sent"", because as much as i know that alot of people understand not wanting to go to a hospital, alot of other people don't.

i am afraid in my next assessment for autism, which will probably be a just me and another worker, i may overshare due to my father not being there. since there are things that he knows about but feels very uncomfortable to discuss over with me still in the room. so i am afraid i might also spill my abusive relationship and alot more mental luggage to a worker i just met, especially by myself.

174,I found out my oldest half sister is in a mental hospital from jail,"I found out through my mother that my oldest half sister is in the mental hospital from jail. 
I stopped contact with my oldest sister for a reason, years ago. Actually from both of my half sisters. Because, they kept being pushy, are disrespectful and just bottom line too much drama. I could never look up to them and still can't trust them till this day. Because, they would quickly get angry based off their built hurt internal issues and life situations. Last time I had contact with her, she got mad because I wasn't so engaging with communication with her. So she kept sending me real mean texts years ago. I told her this is not how to start a sisterhood. I had just lost a family member and was trying to focus on my own life. Not caught in in their drama. So I blocked her. 
I ran into her in a financial aid line and see sat next to and yelled at me. Like she wanted to fight me. I was shocked and embarrassed. Everyone was looking at me. A few months after that her and my other sister come to my house at the time wanting to talk to me and apologize. I left them alone. I didn't want to surround myself with unstable people. I come from a huge family on my mom side with too much drama as is. 
Long story short I have half sisters on my dad side. I am the youngest and my dad never done anything for us. He was a deadbeat. I could never connect with them. I decided to distance myself for my peace and not surround myself with people that's toxic for me. Family or not. You have to be careful who you have around you. I'm trying to set boundaries for myself to protect myself. 

So, anyway my mom works at a mental hospital and my oldest sister recognized my mom and came up to her and asked her about me. Sigh. Gave my mom, her number (which I can't call because she is in a mental hospital. The phone is disconnected) and our dads number. Because my sister found him and now has a relationship with him. She wanted me to call her and looked forward to me calling.
I told my mom this is alot too take in. It's just too much. 
So I sat on all this info for a few days before even trying to call. 
I bite the bullet and prayed before calling her in the mental hospital. I wanted to make sure she is ok and in a better mental space. 
Sadly, since our first convo from hospital. I don't really call her. She calls me. 
Due to her not making any sense. Saying everyone is lying on her. Losing custody of her child not once but twice. Because her friend lied on her taking drugs. 
I looked up her name in the criminal record website. I was shocked she has a long criminal record that goes back years. Now since I found out this information. I do not want to risk being around her. I would be taking a gamble doing so. She does not seem to be telling the whole truth and in denial of her mental status and why she was transferred from jail to there. 
She claims her aunt lied on her saying she assaulted her and the case is old. Her aunt has a restraining order against her. She is facing multiple criminal charges. But she hopes the case gets closed due to it being a few years old. I asked her why did she just transferred from jail to the mental hospital. She claimed it's because she filled out the form in jail wrong so they sent her there. Makes 0 sense. Because she is in a 60 day hold. She keeps telling me the same thing over and over and wants to take the compency test to pass it so she can go home. 
This is just too much. Once again. I don't want to hurt her feelings. But I can't offer her anything. But prayer. I know she feels alone. Her mom and I think our dad talks to her. But my our other sister stopped contacting her years ago. Which is telling on both of their parts. I love everyone. Even the ones that done me wrong. I love my sisters even absent father. 
But, I'm drained and everytime she calls and talk I start to have a headache.

179,My partner was just admitted into an inpatient psychiatric hospital yesterday. Looking for advice and support,"TLDR: My partner had a very sudden manic episode turned into a psychotic break over the past week, and I'm not handling him being in a psych ward for the time being very well. It's honestly killing me, I'm so worried for him - I'm looking for advice and support on how to cope with this event. 

My boyfriend (21M) and I (20F) have been together for nearly 3 years. For 2 years, we were long distance. In August 2023 is when we closed the distance and began living with each other in real life. Last week, the week of May 5th, is when this situation begun. 

We frequently took edibles (weed) as part of our routine. Last Tuesday, he did just that - and while he was high, he started to get curious about his parents' finances. He began to text both his mother and father, asking questions about what they've saved up for their retirement. His mom seemed to be dodging his questions a lot, but eventually she told him that she estimated that both she and his father would have around 10-13 million after retirement. Not only this, but she also both implied and outright confirmed that my boyfriend would be inheriting this large amount of money after they pass away. This quickly unlocked a hyperfixation for him, and we began to talk about it together. It's all we talked about for that week, because we thought, why is this something that his mother would lie about? There's absolutely no understandable reason that she would have to lie about this. I should mention that, after Tuesday, he did not take any more edibles or substances, though regardless I feel that weed may have partially played a role in why this happened. 

Throughout the week, as he was delving into this hyperfixation, his behavior began to change. I didn't truly notice it at the time, and just thought he was very reasonably acting a bit odd and excited because, this was a life changing thing that was presumably happening for the both of us. I didn't think to question his mother's statement. Me being passive to his behavior and not suspicious of his mother's statement and behavior is something I feel I am to blame for, because it turned out to be a slowly building manic episode. On Friday, May 10th, is when we found out that the 10-13 million inheritance was a lie. He was distraught - absolutely broken. Something snapped in him after that day. 

On Saturday, he woke me up at 6-7 am. I suspect that he may not have slept Friday night into Saturday morning. He reassured me that he would be okay, we would both be okay after this, that we would get over it and be able to focus on something else. But very quickly throughout Saturday his behavior shifted drastically, and it turned into a full blown manic episode. For the entire first half of the day, he paced around our apartment, glued to his phone, spamming everyone in his life about the thoughts he had been having. It's normal for him to be on his phone a lot, so I didn't question this. I regret it so much, I should have noticed the signs. It's difficult for me to convey what exactly his thoughts were or what his hyperfixation was, because most of it didn't truly make sense, but the short version of it is that since the inheritance wasn't real, he began to hyperfixate on starting a business from the ground up with both me and his friends. It spiraled from there. 

In the evening is when his behavior began to become violent and increasingly more erratic. He began to direct his frustration and anger towards me, starting to hyperfixate on me and our relationship, blaming me for the entire situation. We've had a difficult relationship, but we've always managed to come back full circle either way. He became paranoid of me, believed that I could hurt him, and so much more. It broke my heart. It's more than I can convey into words. Saturday evening into Sunday morning I stayed up all night with him, trying to handle the situation as best as I could, but it only got worse. Eventually, his parents arrived at our apartment. He's always had apprehensions about introducing me to his parents for multiple reasons, especially including the fact that we met online. He believed that they wouldn't understand it, and he didn't have a close relationship with his parents to begin with at all. It sucks that I could only meet them as this situation was going down. 

Sunday, May 12th, is when his parents took him to the emergency room. It is only just yesterday that he was admitted into a psychiatric hospital. I'm heartbroken. I'm keeping in contact with his mother, but I haven't gotten many updates from her besides the fact that he's in a hospital and that they're waiting to hear from the doctor. Based on what I've seen with his behavior and researched, it seems that his manic episode eventually turned into a psychotic break. I also suspect that he may have bipolar 1 disorder. I'm not a doctor, but it matches up with everything that I've seen, and I'm devastated. It was horrible. His mother has bipolar disorder, though im not sure what type - though my partner did mention that his mother would have occasional manic episodes. 

It's been two days since he's been gone. All I've been doing is grieving. I've eaten very little, all I've been doing is crying, and everything in our apartment reminds me of him. It's incredibly painful to be here without him because we spent all of our time together. I'm also worried about him being in the hospital itself - I don't want him to be mistreated by others or misdiagnosed. Psych hospitals can be very hit or miss, and it terrifies me. It's possible that he could be there for several weeks at the very least given how severe his mental state was. I just don't know what to do, or what this means for us in the future. He hasn't even gotten a diagnosis yet, from what I know. I just feel like I'm being kept in the dark. I don't know anything about what's happening at all. I just want him to be okay. How can I get through this? I don't think I can get through this. What happens when he gets back? Is he gonna be okay? Have any of you experienced what it's like to be kept in a psych hospital? I don't know what to do with myself when he comes back, I don't know how to support myself in the mean time, and I don't know what this means for us or for our relationship. I'm so, so scared. I'm terrified. I love him so much, I just want him to be okay. 

I don't have many people around me to support me, so posting here has been my last resort. I feel awful, I feel horrible, I feel like this is all my fault.

now i have diagnoses, meds, have been to different therapists and psychs over the years, coping skills, etc.... but i feel so close to the edge as a constant. i feel so overwhelmed and overstimulated at all times and it's always ""just one more thing"" for me to think i'll break, but ""one more thing"" happens and doesn't break me -- it just adds to the ever-growing surface tension. there have been points in the past couple years that i've wanted to just surrender and fall into psychosis and check out of reality because it feels like i'm so close to losing it, but it never happens. 

i honestly don't know how much more i can take. i don't know what else to do. my brain hurts, thinking hurts, talking hurts, making decisions hurts. i get overstimulated or confused or flustered and my brain physically hurts.

I just have no contact with her or anyone around her.. And so, my question is, how long may they keep her for? I keep seeing stuff about 72 hours. It's been 24 hours since she went. Any constructive information is very much so appreciated. But please, I don't really wanna hear any bad things about this right now. I'm worried enough.. Thanks for reading.

Edit: I have no idea which hospital she could be in.",1684189656.0,False,2,2,Dystopia_T8,None,13imqgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/13imqgr/hospital_inpatient_stays/
217,"I’m 4 months in psychiatric hospital, best in my city, still wanna die",I really wonder it will ever get better. It’s just depression and it should pass but my hope is going away. 4 months.

218,Think I Need To Go To A Mental Hospital— Advice?,"I(17 M) am unwell. School’s literally drained the life out of me entirely. My sister’s been consistently disrespectful of my space (I have OCD). I’m gender nonconforming in southern USA. I get talked about behind my back constantly. I almost broke down to tears today because my teacher made sure I was taken care of before an assembly. I’ve felt this underlying numbness for years now and it’s unhealthy for me to just keep on ignoring everything. I’ve been looking into mental hospitals because I think I need to go to one for a few weeks at the least, but I’ve heard a lot of horror stories about them. I just wanted to know how others have gone about this or have any recommendations about what to do. I’ll probably be going during the summer since I’m in junior year and getting into college is extremely important to me. Anything helps!

219,Should my dad go to a psychiatric hospital?,"TW: violence, mentions of suicide. 

I just got off the phone with my dad yesterday, and he sounds like he's going a little mad. 
My Dad is living on his mom's property, alone. The property is super run down, and he's trying to ""fix it up"", but he's been there for like 6 months now and the place looks worse than when he began.
Think ""haunted, abandoned house"" that everyone has looted for spare furniture or materials. There's no security, and people from the street can just walk in. And they have. Multiple times. Things have been stolen, and my Dad even got attacked once. 
He took the paint off the pipes, because the pipes are copper and he said it looked better without the paint, and then the pipes were stolen, so there's no running water. 

He mentioned threatening my gran with suicide because she struggled to answer her phone when he's calling her (she's 91. She can't see the screen properly). 

My gran needs to sell the property so she can pay her rent at an old age home. She's 91, and she moved out because she got attacked in that house and almost beaten to death. But my dad refused to sell the property, even though he can't get it up and running.

He's never been able to finish a proper task in his life. He's never held down a job. He throws ""tantrums"" if things don't go his way. Literally, his whole life, he has lived off the people around him. My step mom left him because he wasn't contributing to the household. The agreement was that he'd be a ""stay at home dad"" while she was the breadwinner. But he'd forget to pick the kids up from school (they're twins and 4 years old). And he'd often lose them in parks, and strangers would find them wondering around and look after them for an hour or two wondering where their parents are. Sometimes the kids would have unexplained bruises/scratched on them, and my Dad would say ""that's just an accident. They weren't listening to me, so they got hurt"". He'd forget to feed them. And when he did make meals, the food would be like, uncooked. He wouldn't follow a simple recipe. The house was a mess all the time. He'd leave dangerous tools around the house that the kids would often hurt themselves with. 

After my Dad and my step mom would fight, he would take the kids and sit them down and explain why he wasn't wrong in the situation. From as early as three years, he would force them to listen to as he spoke about those things.

Anyway, right now he is refusing to let my Gran sell her house so she can live in an old age home. I'm not sure if I should get him involuntarily admitted into a psychiatric hospital, so I can help my Gran sell the house.

Otherwise, she'd have to move in with my Dad, and I highly doubt he will take care of her. He's extremely mad at her for not talking to him, and I'm scared he would abuse her, mentally, emotionally and physically. And she's 91. She can barely walk. She needs someone looking after her. I don't know what to do.

220,I am checking myself into a hospital. I’m scared and nervous.,"I’ve been going through a very hard time for almost a decade and recent events in my life have led me to contemplate ending everything more than ever before. I’ve never had to go to a hospital for mental health and I’m scared of what it will be like. For context, I am being framed by someone I know and I was contacted yesterday by a public defender that I have a warrant out for my arrest. I do not want to go to jail. That would destroy my mental state. Because of my mental state I’ve been wanting to off myself, I can’t deal with this alone and I am alone. Can anyone here provide any experience or shed some light on what I’m going to go through in there? Thank you.

222,Considering admitting self into Mental Hospital,"Good evening ya’ll

i will make this short and sweet, but basically all my life i’ve been battling anxiety and depression through self management and series of talk therapy. im getting a psychiatry eval in two days since im finally caving into getting help. my grandmother had BPD and i have been suffering with similar symptoms alongside ocd. 

tonight my mom blew up at me for coming home at 10:30pm. my curfew is at 10. she kicked me out of the house, verbally harrassed me, and called the police on me after i refused to return home or get into her car after an hour of her following me. Now, im a legal adult so they couldnt force me to stay with her but i eventually went home with her to give into perhaps making peace.. as of everything late, and a spike in my symptoms within the past two months (just started college), i feel like i need to admit myself into the mental hospital. 

i keep waiting for appointments, more appointments, and more appointments but every day is getting worse and worse. my mother and i have never had a good relationship but this argument was so huge im starting to have suicidal thoughts again. but im afraid. im afraid to go to the hopsital since horror stories. but i cant be in this house anymore. i cant. im going crazy, i feel insane. this isnt me.. im unmedicated but idk what to do. :(",1695878618.0,False,1,0,applesaucert,None,16u7bul,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/16u7bul/considering_admitting_self_into_mental_hospital/
