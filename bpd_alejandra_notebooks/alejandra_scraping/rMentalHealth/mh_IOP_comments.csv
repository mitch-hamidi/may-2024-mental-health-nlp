0,"Bumping this up, I am in a similar situation and am scared to have my assessment. Has anyone done an IOP and held down a full-time job? What is that like. Did you tell your employer or go on FMLA?",Stef-19-SJ,1afyx8z
0,"I’ve worked in an IOP - the people who go there aren’t “messed up”. They’re just in a space where they need a lot of support with their mental health. 

It’s okay to feel defensive about it and have a lot of mixed feelings. Just know that your therapist probably recommended it because they genuinely think it would be beneficial for you.",StarryCloudRat,18bpi34

0,"I’m sorry if this sounds like me being mean: But you can’t make everything better without putting in the work. 

I was like that too, going to Therapy will make me magically better, but after doing IOP and then going straight back to Therapy, it honestly saved my life and helped me get on track. 

But you honestly have to put in effort, and what you’re sounding like is making excuses why you don’t want too.",,xdnpjm
1,"Respectful, given your outlook, there isn’t much hope for you unless you start caring about your treatment. As hard as it is, you gotta have an open mindset and want to get better. We can provide you the resources, but you have to want to put the work in. The unfortunate thing is your hand isn’t going to be held for the rest of your life. Eventually, you have learn to walk on your own using all the shit you learned.

I’m (17f) almost done with IOP (have about 4 days left) and in truth, I wish it didn’t take me so long realize I am being offered help and it’s up to me to decide whether or not I want to take it. So please, for your own sake, try and take something away fro the program.",n00b2002,xdnpjm

Do you have a GP, pdoc, or psych who you trust? Who has your back? Given you a treatment plan and stood by you through it? 

If not, that is where you need to start. Not on these forums where some people are trolls.

There is a lot left for you. You just need to get past this bad phase. Unfortunately the system isn't always set up to support all people properly.",midnight-dreams18,xdnpjm
6,">IOP was unhelpful. Wtf else is left? Wtf am I supposed to do?

Are you seeing a therapist? A medication manager? Do you have a treatment plan?

My APRN referred me to interventional psychiatry, who prescribed:

IOP         
TMS            
esketamine              
ECT

My therapist and APRN discharged me during IOP, and the psychiatrist prescribed an additional medication. IOP discharged me on Friday, so it’s back to weekly therapy with med management.

I got a lot out of IOP, and took lots of notes. It was CBT and DBT, and I learned skills and scripts to learn to react differently—which will hopefully give me a different outcome. Because what I was doing before IOP was not working for me.

It’s really hard work though, so I can relate to your frustration. Several people in my IOP were in it for the second time.",editorgrrl,xdnpjm

I’m not saying you don’t want to get better but rather you don’t want to put in the work to get better. It’s hard coming out of depression and substance use. Life is hard.  I thing is coming to you for free and no one is pulling you out of this depression. YOU have to stand up, say you are done feeling this way, and figure it out.

It’s going to be hard and exhausting and different from the way you h e been living because well, life is hard and exhausting and you probably expect someone to help you. I understand I truly do. But this is on you man. Start getting up in the mornings and eating healthy and exercising and telling yourself you got this.

If you had time to think it was about how you were going to pay your bills, feed your kid, if your job was going to bottom out.

Took months to fight my way out of the depression and years to fight my way to recovery. That’s what I’m telling you man. It’s a fight. It doesn’t just get better and you don’t have to accept that this is it. If you truly think you are going to end it then do yourself a favor and go to the hospital. It’s not that you are locked up. Take a 30 day mental vacation and get some help. You’re depressed and looking at everything negative man. I wish I could show you how much better it could be. But you would believe me if I told you and you will have to see for yourself.,JMCochransmind,xdnpjm
31,"Being Sober is Beautiful

I was an addict for more years of my life than I was sober. I used opiates to deal with the mental pain of life. I'm not going to write a sob story, but my life growing up wasn't sunshine and roses as I'm sure is the same for most people who are addicted. I was getting so far gone and pushing the pain I had gone through in life so far down and not dealing with it, that it was rotting inside of me. It was starting to make me legitimately crazy. I cared some, but not much, and not enough to get off drugs. I had tried before just to stop, but I didn't realize how much work was going to be involved, what I was in for, or where to begin. It took me three years of trying different methods like methadone, rehab, suboxone, meditation and therapy to finally get to the starting line of what I thought was the path to sobriety.

While going through all of this it was like I was marching up a snowy mountain with a backpack on. I was tightly holding my shoulder straps, trudging through the snow uphill one step at a time. After a couple of months I would lift my head up to see I was still in the exact same place. So again, I put my head down and trudged on. For over a year it seemed like I was in the same place every time I looked up. I had learned a lot though while walking. I truly learned the meaning of patience and calmness and finally understood this is a marathon not a sprint. I learned that hope was the only thing I had in the most desperate times when I felt like just giving up and setting down in the snow, not to care anymore. In the mind of my mind, I was climbing a ladder or the steps of a pyramid. Every lesson was like an ascension of knowing who I was and what I had to do. Like going through the chakras to start at red over and over again, growing the whole time.

One day things changed a little as I felt some tension release. I didn't realize I was over the crest, just knew it was starting to get easier and I felt myself descending down the other side. Still learning in the mind of my mind lessons to take with me. I learned it is okay to just be okay with yourself. That being ashamed and the fear and anxiety that came along with it weren't going to help me on my travels, so I had to shed that baggage to get where I wanted to be. People don't look at you and see what you think of yourself. They just see what is in front of them at that moment. So, if you're doing better, that is the picture you project. They don't know the challenges you're facing in your mind and body to just make it through the day. So again, my head down I keep trudging through the snow down the side of the mountain.

One day I felt something completely different. I had accepted the snow and the mountain and without knowing where I was, I look up and there isn't any snow. I'm coming into a valley with a beautiful meadow, and I can shed some of my baggage knowing I'm in a better place. I still have my journey ahead but I'm feeling better about each step, still learning in the mind of my mind. I have this energy inside of me that wants to persevere. I want to be a good person and give off a good energy for others to realize anything is possible.

Feeling light and free I walk to the edge of the meadow with my shoulders tall and straight from everything I've carried and learned to cope with. The mind of my mind gave way to me being myself and knowing who I was. I felt whole once more. As I make my way through the trees there is a beautiful little stream. I wash myself and stand up a clean person, free and ready to face the world as I had never known before. As I look around with my eyes clear, in that moment I realize, this is beautiful!",JMCochransmind,xdnpjm

1,"I am in a PHP now, court ordered. Honestly, we literally sit in a room all day long and MAYBE do some kind of worksheet in a Group two or three times in the 6 hours we are there. We get a 10-15 minute break for every hour we are there, and we are allowed to go outside to smoke or get fresh air. For lunch, we have a half hour and there is a small bakery literally across the street from the Center. :) WHOO those cupcakes...mmmm!

Useless...especially for someone like me, whose main problem isn't depression or anxiety (though I do have the diagnoses for these), but something way out of the reach of 99% of the professionals in my area. No one knows how to treat it...no one wants to even try.

&#x200B;

Otherwise, it is nice to get out and actually get to socialize with a small group of people twice a week. The counselors are there if you do need to talk about something and the psych is OUTSTANDING! She really really listens to you and engages with you when you are in an appt with her. She doesn't do other paperwork or answer personal calls or fantasize about what's for dinner. She listens. Asks questions. Shoots the shit with you a little. Also...Thursdays are PIZZA DAYS! They order pizza for us. :) I only go because the court says I have to attend.

It's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge that, despite being on the front lines of helping others with their mental health issues, you also faced your own challenges and felt the impact of burnout. Seeking help is never a sign of weakness, but a powerful demonstration of strength and self-awareness. I'm genuinely glad to hear that you took the proactive step of reaching out for support.

Everyone needs help sometimes, regardless of their profession or role in life. Taking care of our mental well-being is essential, and it's heartening to see that you are prioritizing your own mental health journey.

1,"Baptist Health in Jacksonville (about 4 hours away). I was a patient (suicidal, major depression, anxiety) in their inpatient program there for a week and it was lovely. Very clean facility, very caring and intelligent staff. I actually went to nursing school (specializing in mental healthcare) because of the providers and patients I met there. People struggling with addiction generally go to other facilities in the city, and most of the people I met as a patient were struggling with anxiety or depression due to traumatic life events. I’m not sure if anything has changed since I went, but you always have activities and therapy sessions to go to, and you can spend time outside doing yoga as well. There are a variety of staff members, from RNs to art therapists to neurologists and clinical psychologists.

0,"I recently got back from a residential program that I feel made incredible changes for me. Every residential is different, but at mine, these were some of the rules. 

Clothing: anything as long as it doesn’t have drug/alcohol/ed related stuff on it. Most people wore sweats and leggings. All about comfort!
Journals/Art Stuff/iPad drawing: journals are allowed, and they encourage you to limit that, just because it could lead to written rumination. But it’s still your choice. Art stuff is allowed. On the unit you can do lots of arts and crafts. Stuff like paint would have to only be used in the art room and they have plenty there already. I know people have brought crafts like origami, cross stitch/embroidery, diamond painting, coloring books, knitting/crochet, drawing and more. It’s funny you mention the iPad because I recently got into drawing on that and asked to bring it. I talked to my therapist there and explained I wanted my iPad just for drawing. They were able to block the other apps like iMessages. I was able to have it any time which was awesome. 

We have DBT and CBT groups every week day. I learned so much. 

Not going to lie, the food wasn’t great. They had a menu every week you can check and request a sandwich or salad instead. Otherwise I had cereal for other meals. Overall, it was okay to deal with. They do have a dietitian who people talk to if they are SUPER picky, vegan, allergies or ed. They would be able to get other meals planned out. 

No bed bugs. 
You can definitely get enough sleep. 

No specific toiletries, but you can’t have anything that has alcohol in the first 3 ingredients. Many conditioners do. You are able to check them out right before your shower and then return it. Other toiletries can be kept in your room. You are only allowed electric razors. One of the staff has to watch you shave at first until they know you can be safe. Many of the girls waited to shave until then. We weren’t judging if others were a bit hairy lol 

We were allowed to have our phones in the evening until bed. And on weekends we had some time during the day. They block all social media and your camera. They also have iPads that you can use to FaceTime or Skype people back home

This facility was all the way across the country for me and it was worth it. 

All facilities are different, so I don’t know what their rules are.

It’s worth it even though i know it’s scary. I had so much anxiety about going and it was okay. The work was tough, but that’s what we need to get better. I didn’t find it traumatizing at all, just tough but manageable.",OrdinaryPatience,i9cu3y

1,"I can't answer your question but I can tell you about a variety of self-help methods shown to be useful for PTSD and derealization. 

Therapists often recommend self-help to go with their therapy.  
  
If you go to the Amazon ad for The PTSD Sourcebook by Dr. Glenn Schiraldi, you'll see from the reader reviews that people with the disorder really appreciate this book, which says that there's a variety of symptoms associated with PTSD, some of which respond to self-help. For example, there's a simple but effective remedy for recurrent nightmares.   
  
A psychologist named James Pennebaker has written a book on journaling as a treatment for trauma victims, Expressive Writing: Words That Heal. It's based on his clinical research.   
  
A study at Stanford (video, below) in which war veterans - some of whom had not been helped by other treatments - experienced anxiety brought down to normal levels after one week of slow breathing therapy, and good results a year later.  
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvli7NBUfY4&t=3s  
  
The Psychology Today derealization article mentions grounding exercises, which brings up the interesting topic of mindfulness meditation. Some people say that they've had very good results with mindfulness for derealization but others say their results were disappointing.  
  
  
I'll give you some examples of grounding exercises.  
  
  
Eat a handful of raisins or nuts very slowly, appreciating every piece, taking a long time to finish them, being aware of your slow breathing.  
  
  
Wash and dry the dishes very carefully, focusing on what you're doing, the feelings in your hands and the sound of the water.  
  
  
Examine objects. Pick up a  few objects, name them, feel them and carefully inspect them.  
  
  
Count things.  
  
  
Breathing slowly through your nose, be aware of bodily sensations - the air passing through your nostrils, the feeling of your clothing on your skin, the pressure of the floor on the soles of your feet. Look around at the room, aware of the present moment, the here and now.  
  
  
You can't go wrong with stress management. It's something we all need and it can help with anxiety and depression, especially when combined with the standard treatments. This has a lot of info -

https://livelearninc.net/peer-respites

https://power2u.org/directory-of-peer-respites/


A peer respite is a voluntary, short-term, overnight program that provides community-based, non-clinical crisis support to help people find new understanding and ways to move forward. It operates 24 hours per day in a homelike environment. 


Peer respites were designed as psychiatric hospital diversion programs to support individuals experiencing or at-risk of a psychiatric crisis. The premise behind peer respites is that psychiatric emergency services can be avoided if less coercive or intrusive supports are available in the community.


Peer respites engage guests in mutual, trusting relationships with peer staff. Peer support involves a process of mutual helping based on the principles of respect and shared responsibility. Peer support includes interactions in which individuals help themselves and others through fostering relationships and engaging in advocacy to empower people to participate in their communities.


Peer respites are staffed and operated by people with psychiatric histories or who have experienced trauma and/or extreme states. This means that 100% of staff have lived experience of extreme states and/or the behavioral health system.",GreetTheIdesOfMarch,1aq8cym

This is a level of care that is outpatient based, but you spend nearly the whole day in group therapy in a setting with others going through similar things. It typically lasts about 7 days and then are often stepped down to a Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) where you'd essentially meet still in a group setting about 3 hours a day, three times a week for about 4-6 weeks. This helps keep the stabilization from PHP and still gives you the support, guidance and knowledge to keep working on your recovery. These types of programs are usually offered at local community mental health centers or psych hospitals.",IntrovertGal1102,1aq8cym

I am 41f, and I did this program last year— it was very good. The only difficult part is the cost. It is about $62,000 for the 14 day program, and since the Pavilion is a self-pay program, they do not accept insurance or directly assist with insurance reimbursement.

I was fortunate enough to have family with the resources to help me go, and it was excellent. Even if you don’t have the money, it’s worth reading about the program on the website, just to get an idea of what’s out there. I had no idea that there were “residential” programs like this one that were not inpatient. I could keep my phone, computer, all my clothes—the only thing that was controlled was the nurse handled everyone’s meds. I am sure there are at least a few residential programs out there that are similar to the Pavilion, and hopefully take insurance.

When you leave they give you this big list of medications (over and behind the counter) that we shouldn't take because it could stimulate the receptors and cause cravings/relapse. Many of those meds have way way less pleasurable aspects than nicotine. I'm trying to think of a good example but all I can think of is over the counter sleep meds but there's better examples.

0,"Please do some research on the troubled teen industry. Do not send your daughter to an RTC- that will very likely traumatize (or re-traumatize) her and may put her in physical danger (Rip Taylor Goodridge and all the others we’ve lost). I would also recommend against PHP’s, but they’re a much better option than RTCs due to having more legal oversight (but don’t get it twisted: PHPs have their issues as well). 

Why I wouldn’t do a PHP) Removing your child from their home environment for “treatment” only teaches them how to survive in their new environment- not at home. Most of the time, the “progress” seen in residential centers does not carry back home- and this outcome doesn’t improve with longer residential stays… ie no matter when you bring your kid back, she’s going to relapse/backslide. This is multiplied by the trauma experienced by your child in these facilities, and can result in even more severe mental health struggles upon return. Companies under the troubled teen industry know this, and use this fact to manipulate you into giving them more money. They know that your kid is going to relapse no matter how long you keep her in there… and they know they can just blame you for her relapse if you chose to bring her home “early”. These programs and the “treatments” they use have no scientific backing. Do not trust their sweet words- they will say anything to get your money.

If you want more information, I highly recommend the podcasts “Gooned” by Emma Lehman and “Broken Promises” by Marlee Porter. You can also look into “Unsilenced”- a nonprofit organization advocating against institutional child abuse.

I was hesitant, but it really did help me to just open up and try to gain something from it.  It was difficult to share with a bunch of strangers, but it was necessary, because nothing else was working for me.

1,"I’ve been in psychiatric hospitals 3 times, intensive inpatient and out, then transitional housing. I had some traumatic experiences that I thought broke me. I didn’t always agree with certain practices by staff which was frustrating and I felt alone/unsupported at times. 

I was just telling my 13 year old sister when she was feeling sad and hurt, that it is ok!! No matter what anyone thinks! It sounds like you experienced discomfort; you talking about it isn’t drama or being whiny. Even if it happened 10 years ago. Old news…. Nope. How ever you feel, feel it then release it when you’re able to. People that judge us can go to hell. There’s bad communicators in this lifetime and we can only control our reactions to things. No matter how other people react your feelings are valid. 

You getting help is amazing! It’s tough work that a lot of people don’t have the courage to do.",Ohmyyikess,rotgbz
0,"My situation is a little different, but I hope it helps just hearing what I did. I took some time off of school after going through a really terrible period of mental health issues. I had an abusive sibling and when that situation got to its worst I fell apart. Even when he was removed from my home and legally kept away, I seriously struggled with being in college at that time. School has always been so important to me, and my parents expect a lot from me, so it was such a hard choice. I spent a while just working like twice a week and doing therapy. I think having a lot of time at home was both helpful and harmful. Mentally, it hurt me a lot to see myself not being able to function how I did before my PTSD induced breakdown. But on the other hand, I really needed space to heal, while not being triggered by everything that was expected of me. It was the first time I didn’t feel like I absolutely needed to be doing 15 things at once and like I was always “behind” on everything. After a while, I started working more, and that helped a lot. I’ve always been someone who’s strives with routine and staying busy. I thought a lot about what I wanted to do during that time, and leaned into that (biomed research). I started saving money, having less emotional outbursts, doing better socially. Then I applied back to school, and used the same sort of methods. I kept myself SO BUSY with work and classes/labs. Then I applied to an internship (ended up getting hired instead) and it really turned my life around. I was so filled with passion for the research I was doing and so focused on projects. So even through hard moments (even still I’ll have a night where I fall apart again) my work is the best way to pull myself out of a downward spiral",Swiftiecatmom,1c8h93j

0,"To answer your question they only drug test people who are on medications involving  antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti anxiety, etc.
You’ll be safe if your not prescribed on any medications for a mental illness. The partial hospitalization program is pretty lockdown they take your belongings and your phone when you walk in, they also check your shoes to see if your not bringing any drugs and dangerous objects that could be cause self harm. I’ve been in the partial hospitalization program when I was 15 and it’s not fun but not bad either. My program ran from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm and is structured like a school only with less people. This involves a daily schedule with periods, each hour/period involves activities and lessons which consists of coping skills, mindful thinking, reframing, self reflection, and learning/understanding yourself. Most of the lessons are boring as I remember spacing out and learning nothing but if you want to better yourself, I recommend paying attention and contributing with the lesson. If you stay engaged and ask questions not only will the lesson be helpful but it will make time go by quickly. I remember some kids would run away as soon as they were dropped off near the entrance of the building but eventually they would get caught and brought back to the hospital with nasty attitudes. The staff are kind and willing to teach and engage with everybody although that may depend on the place you go to. The staff in my hospital loved to socialize and were friendly which made me feel much more comfortable being there. I remember there was a girl who was suicidal and was brought to a safe room (always with her consent) and while she was in there staff members would talk to her kindly for hours without leaving her behind. They were passionate to help us and are there for you whenever you need to talk or have any questions. The program also has lunch time and breaks where you have the opportunity to socialize and engage with your peers. I highly recommend that you socialize and make friends so that you can enjoy going and have another reason to attend the program. I had a hard time making friends due to my paranoia and the day felt like an eternity. I loved the lunch as we were given two good options which consisted of a salad meal and a regular meal (sandwich or pizza, juice, beans, and a snack). During lunch we would either talk about how our days are going or watch a movie. During break everyone played card games, board games, and video games. Near the end of the day we would go to a classroom with a teacher who will teach basic school subjects like math, english, history, etc. During this time I had an opportunity to finish all of the school work that I missed during that school year. Once the lessons are over you will be able to get your belongings including your cellphone back and leave the building. It may be a locked environment but it’s not bad when you have caring staff members and peers/friends who want to watch you succeed.",Particular_Tadpole27,vi7wz5

2,"Our PHP is 18+ and we don't do any of that shit. Hell, that sounds more like when I was in freaking jail! In our PHP, we come and go as we please, and if we want to leave, we can. We just have to sign ourselves out and tell the counselor we are leaving. I spend most of my 2 days a week there (thank you COVID for knocking me from 5 days to 2 days (and then no days when the Center was closed), which they never changed back after re-opening ahahahha lucky me!) wandering around the hallways, or going downstairs to visit the pharmacy staff, or sit outside for a while. I have ADD (just found THAT out) and am autistic, so it is safer for me to be able to go outside if I need to, especially with my main disorder. Sometimes it flairs up really bad (I will have BAD impulses and urges) so I really need to be away from people and chill out when that happens. It happens more than I would like to admit, so I am always wandering the hallways or outside. I, truthfully, am only in the PHP because the court ordered me there as part of my Probation once I had been released from jail, where I had spent a year. Once I am off Probation in December, I really don't have to go anymore if I don't want to. Only 6 more months to go! I think I might just stay in it, even though they can't do much for my main disorder there anyhow, and they know it, so I am just left alone a lot of the time. We do worksheets and talk about stuff in Group, and we watch a movie every Friday. We do a lot of work with anxiety, depression (I am dx'ed with both) and coping skills, self-image, stuff like that. I will admit that some of the worksheets catch my interest, and they often are very insightful. They get ya thinking that's for sure.

I get along with everyone there (one guy creeps me out, but he is just a creepy kind of dude and has NO filter...yikes) and with all the counselors. It is a nice place to get away from home for a couple days from 9am-3pm and it is nice to be in a place where you feel you belong. It is very comfortable and pleasant, and I will admit, I don't mind going there much at all. Just getting up at 7:30am to get my van at 8:30am SSUUUUUUUUCCCCCKKKKKS. I am lucky that transportation is provided! :D That is the worst of it though.

That's my experience, as an adult in PHP, which isn't much different than a juvenile Program would be (I don't know if our counseling center has one), content-wise. Good luck!",SadAndAnxiousBean,vi7wz5

2,"Hey, if you check some of my posts I’ve talked about how I got rid of my dp/dr and it was very chronic and intense and took a lot of work. I personally think it’s great that you can do a hospital programme and derealisation is definitely a worthy reason. You might learn a lot of new ways to overcome it and learn to not be afraid of derealisation. 

I’ve done so much research on derealisation and depersonalisation and the main point that a lot of people speak of is “acceptance”. Once you start to accept the derealisation and not be scared of it, it slowly goes away. I would say I’m fully recovered from it but I do have my moments during the day where I think “is this real?” But I slowly draw myself back and just accept it and then I proceed with my day. 
I think if you feel comfortable with doing the hospital programme you should it might really help.",Soft_Parsley9742,sv3r39

Pissed because I called my insurance provider yesterday and asked about the specific program at the specific facility and they said it was 100%.",SoophieArt,sv3r39
5,"She knows. She's concerned about your progression. This isn't typically something that resolves itself.
If cannabis is what triggered this I hate to say it but it's not the cannabis' fault. It just brought out something hidden. It doesn't cause these psychosis breaks and pull them out of nowhere, it picks them out and unmasks them prematurely. If cannabis hadn't done it, a severe trauma event could've done it too. It would've been much worse in that case though I'm sure. They trying to give you the tools to lessen progression before that happens.",ConfidantLacking,sv3r39
6,"I’m not experiencing psychosis, I’m experiencing derealization. I’m aware cognitively that what I’m feeling is wrong and that reality is real. I know people want to believe that weed is some miracle drug that can do no harm, but it’s been shown to be a trigger for derealization on its own. The only known causes for depersonalization or derealization are trauma and drugs, and I’m not a victim of trauma. If dissociation was like psychosis, then it would respond to antipsychotics, but it doesn’t unfortunately :(",SoophieArt,sv3r39
7,"I do know that weed typically only triggers psychosis in those who are already showing subclinical signs of psychosis, but that’s not me. I’ve never been psychotic and I have no family history of schizophrenia or any psychosis.",SoophieArt,sv3r39
8,"I didnt say it didnt harm you. It triggers predispositions  is what I was getting at. Which is why I said, if the cannabis didn't do it trauma would very likely cause it eventually. If a bad trip on cannabis can cause you enough stress to trigger that disposition, imagine what any serious trauma mightve done?
Or still might do. You're aware of it which is what rules it out of being a psychosis yes. But you're in denial of its severity and possible progression. Professionals have given you warning you need help, that's what they trained to do. It's better to learn the skills that'll be offered now before it possibly does worsen. What's the worst thing that happens? You get some new coping methods and are better completely in time? Or you do get worse but it's easier to manage because you've already started the work?",ConfidantLacking,sv3r39
9,"Cannabis only triggers predispositions of mental illness. It does not create them.
And you don't have to be showing any signs or symptoms for it to trigger them. 
The tricky thing about family history is a surprising amount of people don't ever get diagnosed and therefore there's no history. In lineage probably only a few Gen back in your family it wouldn't have been uncommon for the aunt who heard and talked to birds that weren't there to not be mentioned, or to be made light of...
If I relied on my family history it would look like my dad developed BPD out of nowhere.
I'd have developed so many diagnoses out of nowhere with no possibility of getting based on history. because its only genetic or triggered by brain damage (which i do not have). Some of which turned round and made me see symptoms I was missing, and exactly which family member needed a visit too. My grandma was diagnosed with anxiety after years of insomnia only because I finally found a GP who said ""I don't think it's your insomnia as a root issue, I think it's your anxiety"" and I told her about my own visit.

That's literally the only way it could've been a root cause.

19,"Why are you accusing me of arguing with a stranger on the internet when that’s literally what you’re doing too? It’s not like you’re leaving the conversation or anything. You want to win. It’s bigger than a few bad trips. The bad trip caused the initial problem and rumination made it continue and become more prevalent in my mind.

20,"And I'm sorry but no one is normal. And if your going by a mental stability point of view, if you were normal, weed wouldn't have triggered this.",ConfidantLacking,sv3r39
21,"Because it's not what caused it. It triggered it. There's a big difference in those two words. You seem to miss my overall point that I've now started falling away from. And your initial request.
Idk how much time you've spent researching cause of mental illnesses or who all you've spoken to. I've spent 10yrs doing so daily. Because no family history so how could this have possibly popped up without trauma related to it that i may not have acknowledged as trauma?
I don't see why you need to fight about this at all, you asked for advice and opinions on going to treatment. I gave you that opinion and then you started to argue about cannabis being the cause instead because you didn't like that part of mine. I'm sorry we see different research, but with cannabis it's underesearched and as someone who has spoken to doctors for and against it and had my medical marijuana licensing for years (meaning I have had doctors and NPs who specialized in medical cannabis to give me my facts) I know all the research is biased or not done in control set ups on both points of view.
As a teen I was convinced my mental health problems were a direct relation and caused by cannabis use. Until I quit for 2 yrs and things got significantly worse. It wasn't until a doctor took a real good look at my history and suggested cannabis wasn't the cause but over consumption of it may have been what triggered  something. It's not medicine for everyone, I'm not saying that. But it can't be demonized as the cause because it's not.",ConfidantLacking,sv3r39
22,"I have actually at least half agreed with everything you've said. I don't care if I win. What am I gonna get? Really though. I agreed that it is bigger than the trips, really you're the one who doesn't think it is or you'd have accepted the suggestion to take treatment. 
I never said it wasn't a possibility your brain wouldn't manage coping, I also said there are other things in life that could trigger it too.
These issues are never not going on through the entirety of everyones life and everyones degree of severity is different. Some brains just manage to cope better than others. Accept that your brain is perfect and no one's normal. Getting help is OK and a professional has given you the best way to do it.
You never address the advice given that you asked for.",ConfidantLacking,sv3r39

This person is literally just asking for an opinion specially about DEREALISATION not about psychosis or any other mental illness. Stop trying to put this person into that category, they have clearly been assessed by a team of professionals who have ruled out other mental illnesses and are just trying to work to undo the derealisation which is a TRAUMA RESPONSE from heightened anxiety in which many many people experience from weed without having any mental illnesses or family mental illness history. So it does not mean it’s psychosis or any other illness. 

Yes derealisation can go hand in hand with other mental illnesses but derealisation can be a stand alone symptoms.",Soft_Parsley9742,sv3r39
25,"I’m not trying to demonize it, I just feel like people aren’t educated on it. It’s impossible to identify who’s “predisposed” to dissociation from weed until it actually happens to them. Couldn’t it get worse as time goes on because you formed the initial neural connections due to the weed and then rumination and worry caused those connections to get stronger despite quitting weed years ago? You can’t just look at the evidence and just claim it’s all biased because it isn’t supporting your beliefs. If you have some sort of research that supports what you’re trying to argue, feel free to show it to me and I’d be happy to read it and consider its findings.",SoophieArt,sv3r39

27,"Yeah they are. I never said all side effects are long term. You're putting words in my mouth now. The side effects you're referring to are not from the cannabis, they're from what was triggered by it. Again some brains cope better than others. Whether it's due to environment, circumstance, genetics whatever it may be the increases or lessen those risks too.
Name calling. Oof that's gonna get whatever your point is across.",ConfidantLacking,sv3r39
28,"It's not impossible, but near yes. That's the risk anyone takes consuming any drug of any kind. Even nicotine can trigger anxiety by removing/replacing old unknown coping methods.
You didn't form those initial connections due to weed, you merely opened them or worsened them.
The older I get the more little silly things and even one time events I look back on I see patterns that were so spread apart and just went unnoticed that if they'd grouped together and been recognized my diagnoses could've come before the breakdowns. It's really hard to appropriately assess family or even individual history to determine these things that don't show up on lab tests. There's so much that's easily missed or pushed off because there is such a broad range of symptoms and the similarities in cases can only ever be generalized. 
Yes that is exactly what's happening. As I've tried to say. This is the concern of your professional and why they suggested this treatment, you have progression despite stopping consumption. You are at a critical life stage being in uni, I think you underestimate how easily stress can cause another break for you. Your professional can see a note signs you won't. And they won't always tell you what they are, especially if you're iffy about accepting help offered.
Which no offense is clearly the case here.

I’m also wondering if they’re biased in favor of recommending more intensive treatment to make the facility more money. I’m not sure. Joining the program would mean letting my employers know I can’t work for 3 weeks, abandoning my responsibility to watch my sister, potentially missing out on important school assignments and lowering my gpa, and committing to being in therapy for 4 hours a day 5 days a week. Before this, the most therapy I’ve gotten was once weekly, so it seems like a big step to me.

1,"(Sorry for my English, I'm using a translator)

A comment above questioned him about actually being a narcissist, having called himself that, and a legitimate narcissist, would never do that.

I disagree. I have a lot of contact with narcissists, both because I was a victim of one, also following the cases of very close friends of mine, who had relationships with people like this, and also because I study the subject.

Narcissists feel special because they are different. Many, in the height of their arrogance, consider narcissism as something positive, as it only reinforces their self-view of being special.

But in most cases, they reject the idea that they are narcissists. However, they often use this to victimize themselves, referring to themselves as narcissists, as someone with a problem, but they themselves do not believe it, they use this speech only to manipulate you, make you feel sorry, as if they were victims, and thereby justifying their abusive attitudes

Every victim of narcissism has the impression that they always get along well. Because they are highly manipulative, they give the impression that right after destroying their life, they find a new person, deceive that person, make it seem like they are a good guy/girl. While you are completely torn apart, trying to pick up the pieces, that person who destroyed you is there, with another, in an apparently happy relationship, as if nothing had happened. Feeling of injustice

But after this phase of anger, which is totally understandable, you will realize that this is just an illusion: The harsh and even sad reality is that a narcissist is condemned to self-sabotage throughout his life, with practically minimal chances of a cure, as there is no effective treatment for narcissistic personality disorder.

The vast majority of people can make a lot of mistakes, but they learn from their mistakes, make amends, and evolve. Most psychological disorders, if treated well, can be cured or even alleviated, as the person understands the problem, is willing to change behaviors, follow treatment and, when necessary, use medication, and with that, can have a full life, reasonably normal and free from suffering.

But not for a narcissist: As they are unable to understand and accept their own problem in 90%+ of cases, there is nothing they can do. And all their actions will inevitably lead them to ruin. It doesn't matter that they are great manipulators, so they can deceive people to obtain their own benefits (money, relationships, status), their high ego, their arrogance, their lack of empathy, their fetish for manipulating and controlling, and their true self: They are people empty of spirit, in the end, will ALWAYS lead them sooner or later to their downfall, in everything. You can sustain a lie for a long time for many people: But never forever. And narcissism, their essence, is precisely the lie.

Having said all that, what you can and should do is: Therapy. Not only to put the pieces back together, but to close the gaps: Narcissists only have relationships with people with psychological disorders. A narcissist will never stay with a healthy person for long. If a narcissist entered and established himself in your life, it is necessarily because he noticed your gaps and weaknesses, and used this to enter and establish himself.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy will help you identify these vulnerabilities and their origin. With this, you and your therapist will be able to chart a path so that you can improve, evolve as a person, increase your self-knowledge, putting a real barrier to abusive people's profiles (narcissists are not the only ones). You will realize that many of the reasons why you wonder why all this happened, their origins are there in the formation of your own personality, which took place in childhood.

And finally, obviously, cut off any contact with him. Don't allow him to come back into your life, you can be sure he will come back (yes, narcissists always look for their exes when they get things wrong), he will try to activate all your triggers to convince you to give him another chance. Don't allow yourself to have this relapse.

I think that's it. As I said, I have a lot of experience with this subject, so if you want to talk more about it, feel free to send me a PM, I'll be happy to help you (:",rapid_rodrigo,1axnt76

He obviously doesn't have it number one, bc if he did he would be ashamed about it- not use it against you. And second, he clearly doesn't even know that- he's just using it to fuck with your head.

5,"Thank you so much for taking the time to respond to this in such detail. I really appreciate hearing from someone who has had first hand experience with a narcissist because some people just don’t understand how deeply complicated it is to be a victim of one. It really fucks with your mind even after removing them from your life. 

I do agree that he was using it as a way to be “different” from other people, and he knew I have such deep empathy and understanding for those with mental health struggles so I could never blame him for being mentally troubled. And he certainly pursued me because he knew I was deeply in pain and struggling during that time of my life. My therapist says he liked when I was unhealthy, and knew he had the power to keep me unhealthy. He liked that I thought I needed him but he didn’t need me. The manipulation and gaslighting was insane. 

I do really appreciate this response. It’s really hard to have some people remind me that he clearly never loved me. I know that and have accepted it a while ago. I’m not struggling because I want his love- I’m struggling because he continues to have power over my life and emotions and I want nothing more than to take my power back. Luckily he will never be in my life again (legally can’t speak to eachother).",DesperateAd9898,1axnt76

7,"Thank for you taking the time to respond! And for the recommendations. I am definitely curious into looking into why I attracted him. I think it was mostly that he saw I was broken at the time and he knew I was susceptible to manipulation. But for why I accepted that and continued pursuing him after he showed his true colors is something I want to understand. I’ve been tapping back into my spirituality and trying to stop wondering why the world is the way it is, why there’s evil people, why am I always a victim. And start doing more internal work- why do I see myself as a victim, why do I accept mistreatment, why do I let other place value on me.",DesperateAd9898,1axnt76
8,"And another thing... all those things you can't help but ""wonder""? You're not wondering. That's what you hoped he would become for you- and let me say you have no part in who he is. Everything in everyone's life is based on the decisions that they make- he just didn't make you part of his decisions. It can be hard to come to terms with but that's... most times, really all there is to it. Sure you might ""care"" about him in some way, and that's perfectly fine- you can still wish him well. That doesn't mean you need to put up with any of the shit he put you through.",TheRealestOne2007,1axnt76
9,"I understand perfectly, because until 2022, I didn't realize it, but I had Wendy syndrome, a condition that makes you sacrifice yourself for the person, take on their pain and responsibility, save them, be the hero to the detriment of yourself.  This creates emotional dependence, because when you want to ""save"" your loved one, you are just having all your energy sucked away, which is obviously the perfect victim for an abuser.

 Empathy is a scale from 0 to 12, where 0 is exactly a person completely codependent and vulnerable to others, and 12 is a psychopath completely devoid of scruples, empathy and respect for others.  We must fight to stay in the 6, where we feel love, compassion and respect for others, but also feel love and respect for ourselves.",rapid_rodrigo,1axnt76
10,"He did it just because he was ""bored"" for lack of a better term. In all honesty- it is quite possible he didn't mean to fuck you up like that- then again, it's quite possible he did it to you so he could forget the rest of the girls that he's done that to, continuing a cycle. My oppinion, i honestly don't think you meant much to him regardless what he'd told you. It isn't my place to make any calls like that- but realistically, if you care about somebody, you're gonna incorporate them into whatever decision you're making and if it affects them negatively- well you won't do it. Narcissists have ""supplies"" and he ran you dry.. you're a reserve of energy in his head, and he just wants to empty you emotionally, mentally, physically, financially, and whatever other way you can imagine. He cheated on you and ""moved on"" bc he doesn't care- he just wanted someone new. If he is a narcissist at all, then he knew he was done with you well before he really was. Its a funny thing, where they adore the admiration and praise from people- but if it's from somebody who can see their flaws, it basically just means nothing to them. That's why they go for strangers, they're completely new people and all the bars are totally reset. 

Also- i apologize for the info-dump, but ik what it can be like to question absolutely everything about your existence because of one person who barely did anything- and that you've seemingly gotten over. Time doesn't really solve much tho. Let yourself grieve a bit more if you need, get it out. I still haven't moved on from my first real gf bc of that... let yourself get over it, don't force yourself to stop caring. It doesn't rly work that way.",TheRealestOne2007,1axnt76

0,"I've been to a few IOP programs, and they were mainly geared towards learning cognitive behavioral therapy coping mechanisms in a group therapy setting. 

First, we would process how our day or week was going. Next, the facilitator would teach some CBT technique. Finally, we would discuss the application of the technique in imagined situations. 

Sometimes, it would vary in the format because something would come up in the process part or the facilitator found something more useful in one of our discussions.

They can be helpful if you have a facilitator the group trusts and the members of the group participate. I've been in good groups and challenged groups. The better facilitators will prevent one person from dominating the discussions. 

A good group, with a good facilitator, can help immensely if you really put yourself out there. You have to really participate and engage for that to happen. You have to play an active role for it to be beneficial.

Speaking from my own experiences, while not nearly as traumatizing as yours are, or at least not in the same way, I believe its perfectly fine and understandable to hate your parents to some capacity for their failings, especially when its ones they make counciously.


Ideally parents should help foster their children into being the best they can be but unfortunately many parents hold the idea that its a parent's ultimate authority to make their child into what they want, (hell my own mother loves to go on either about how im only bi becuase she never said i couldn't be as if that was her decision or becuase of the gay agenda, whatever that means)


Personally, i say fuck em, i know its hard, its hard for me and i don't even live with mine so i can imagine its so much harder for you, all you can really do for now i think is just try to endure and, if possible, try to find some kind of support group or individual irl",fetophe,14moar0

3,"Nope. Absolutely not. Forgiveness is your choice. And while yes, forgiving is more for yourself, and yes, it can benefit you, it still has to be your choice. I will say this, forgiving can be a part of your healing journey if you ever plan to move on from your trauma. But 1) you don't have to and 2) that's completely up to you. Especially if you're still living with them and they don't change or respect your boundaries. Most people who become parents are often grown up children who accidentally conceived without much thought of how to raise one. Some don't even see their child as their own person. And it sucks, but you're not alone. I can assure you that. If you really want to leave your household, you can opt for a roommate. There are multiple choices out there you can choose, but only you can choose your path. So choose wisely.",Expensive_Hunt_6266,14moar0

How much school work are you doing? Naturally your body is going to be pretty tired if you are recovering from AN but if you add moving around all day AND school work then you’re going to be exhausted.

1,"Alright here's the good and simple facts. 

1. Your life may be shitty but there are good things about it, go look out the window at birds, get a cup of coffee and a muffin and just sit in the sun, find enjoyment in the work you do or just pick up a book, if you need suggestions I know of a couple fiction series that are great.  

2. People arround you love and care about you, even though you may not think so. When you have thoughts like ""you will never be good enough"" and "" you are just a failure"" that is simply not true.  People care, even if it's just the guy who comes into the gas station for some chips and a soda, people value you and what you bring.  Never feel like you are worthless and never think you don't matter, because you do, if you want to just talk, I know I'm a stranger, but maby that will help in some way.

3. If this is the worst life has to offer it can only get better from here right? When a person is on the bottom step of the ladder of life one can only go up. Even if it's not fast, even if you step back a couple of times you can only go up.  And you may be on the bottom rung again, but that doesn't mean you can jump off the ladder entirely.  Keep trying, keep moving, slowly, one step at a time, the more you work, the easier it becomes

4. Find something or someone who relies on you.  If you don't already, go get a pet if you can, it doesn't have to be a purebread, it could be something as simple as a beta fish, just find something you can love and love it.  Love that thing/animal/person and don't stop, for instance my doggo is always there to wake me up, and wags her tail every time I look at her.  It always helps me get up in the morning and do what I need, just so I can hug her again

5. Go talk to people. I know it's hard to talk about this stuff, and thank you for reaching out on reddit, but talk to friends, family, co-workers they can help more then anybody on this stupid app could

6. I know how hard it is to be in and out of the hospital, but you need to keep working and functioning. If you sit and let yourself go, then you will become weak and unable to do much, that will only worsen depression.  I want to help you, I want to keep you here in this world, I want you to be as happy as you can. Don't just compartmentalize or hide stuff, because that only digs a deeper hole for yourself",BillNyeNaziSpy6767,l6mj0c

0,"I think this is a panic problem. If you're unable to leave the house, I'll be happy to advise you.

Panic disorder often responds to self-help. In fact, Handbook of Self-Help Therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that of all the disorders, panic disorder is the one that’s most responsive to self-help.   
  
I heard someone say that although slow breathing is good for moments of panic, the attacks keep coming back. So, it looks like cognitive therapy is also helpful. Cognitive therapy for panic disorder involves understanding what the attack is. The symptoms are nothing but your system's natural responses to whatever seems threatening. You shouldn't get upset about them. You don't worry about fast heartbeat when you run, and there's no reason to fear it with a panic attack. Source - When Panic Attacks by Dr, David Burns..  
  
You can't go wrong with stress management. It's something we all need. This could help you with your problem.  
  
Psychology Today online says that Dr. Dave Carbonell is a clinical psychologist who specializes in treating fears and phobias and the author of three self-help books, including Panic Attacks Workbook.  
  
In this video, Dr. Carbonell demonstrates a breathing exercise that he says is helpful for panic attacks.

One of the best treatments is time. You know the old saying ""Familiarity breeds contempt."" After a while, the attacks are seen as a nuisance instead of a threat.  
  
I’ll tell you about two other things that you probably won’t need. It’s good to know they’re there if you need them.  
  
A study by a researcher named Meuret at Southern Methodist University showed that a biofeedback method called CART that reinforces slow, shallow breathing was effective. Slow breathing is often recommended, but deep breathing tends to promote hyperventilation, making it hard for people to breathe. Many people use slow breathing self-help successfully.  
  
There's a treatment called interoceptive exposure therapy. It's teaching people not to fear the symptoms of the panic attack by deliberately bringing on the symptoms - for example by bringing on a fast heartbeat by aerobic exercise.",RWPossum,yazr08

1,"Unfortunately, a provider can’t be forced to take on a specific patient. 

Generally speaking, of the 3 disorders listed, anorexia is by a huge margin the riskiest condition to manage outpatient due to known mortality rates associated with the disorder. 

Add on metabolic and biological processes being impacted by both untreated anorexia and possibly psychiatric medications, I can understand why an outpatient psychiatrist may feel this is out of their scope of practice. 

If treatment for anorexia is an option, that may be a prelude. That care may also be interdisciplinary and can include psychiatry with a specialty focus on intersections of eating disorder and other mental health concerns.",randomlygeneratedadv,smaw06
2,"Talk to a GP - might get a prescription for a mood stabilizer.  
  
As the video shows, teenagers with anorexia do much better with family-based treatment than with individual therapy with office visits.  
  
Something that can help with anorexia and also mood disorders - relaxation.  
  
As this article explains, studies show that relaxation methods help with anorexia, although of course you have to be extremely careful about exercise, as this is usually part of the problem.   
  
https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/blog/the-benefits-of-relaxation-training-in-anorexia-recovery  
  
About relaxation, the research on controlled breathing is amazing. A study with war veterans convinced the VA to recommend this for vets with PTSD.   
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPyiddgWlfE&t=115s  
  
DBT - an excellent therapy for behavior problems - recommends a number of coping methods, including paced breathing.  
  
It's very important to calm down. It's good for you at the dinner table and your parents.  
A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.  
  
  
When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
   
   
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
   
   
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
   
   
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
   
   
When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.

  
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
   
   
The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication. 

  
Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety and bipolar disorder.  
   
   
Video - a lot of helpful information, including the 3-part program of Brown and Gerbarg  -

0,"IOP is usually a lot of group therapy--which is going around talking, but there are often ""activities"" like writing out some kind of letter or plan that really sucks to write out because it involves a lot of emotion and delving into your past and trauma and such. When you're just talking, it's not light-hearted stuff. You're listening to difficult, emotional stories, usually some that resonate in you--and then the person leading it usually picks up on that and asks you what you're thinking/feeling right while you're in that. It SUCKS. But it's amazing. 
You'll also have regular one-on-one therapy sessions and psychiatry sessions. All the various professionals involved in IOP will meet together regularly to discuss how you're doing and what your treatment should be going forward. It's nice to have multiple perspectives seeing you and discussing what's going on..we're like complicated puzzles that get put back together better when there are various people working as a team to do it.

The rule of thumb when you're not improving (if you don't feel like your therapist is just a terrible fit) is to go up a treatment level, which is IOP. Your therapist seems to know what she's doing. You could ask her if she's had other clients go to this specific program, and how they did, if they thought it was good, etc. You can also ask for referrals for other IOP programs so that you can ""shop"" a bit to find the best fit.

Where are you? What are you dealing with? There might be some of us who can help suggest places as well.",Mnemophobic,7u7pxg
1,Yes there is. Your therapist could have referrals or the clinic you see her at might have groups. But also it’s usually not the only thing because there’s certain things you wouldn’t be comfortable sharing in a group. My personal opinion is that you should talk about your feelings with your therapist if they are good they’ll actively try to work with you and make changes. It is also possible that it may not be a good fit. Getting started in therapy is so hard but also know that biggest predictor of success is your relationship with the person. I also think you should talk about what you want to change and how you’d know if it were changing. That will give you more concrete goals to work forward. ,laur_han,7u7pxg
2,I’m near the sacramento area in California. My dad passed away in a severe car crash almost a year ago when a man who was high on meth crossed into oncoming traffic at 9 in the morning when my dad was on his way to baseball practice for the 11 and 12 year olds he was voluntarily coaching for. I was basically just numb until October of last year when I felt my mental health really start to decline and it’s only gotten worse since then where I constantly get suicidal urges and don’t feel like I belong here. It was so hard for me especially because my parents had separated when i was in eighth grade and I just didn’t know what or how to feel. ,Dyekaj,7u7pxg
3,"Yeah, I'd say that since you've been in therapy for 3 months already, and you don't seem to be improving (again, if this isn't because the therapist doesn't seem to be a good fit and she's agreeing that you aren't improving) then definitely moving up to IOP seems to be a good idea. What you're going through sounds so difficult, and it totally makes sense that you're feeling the way you are. Telling your therapist all of your thoughts about the program you visited and asking every question that you can think of about your options is the best thing you can do to figure out where you need to go from here.",Mnemophobic,7u7pxg

Suggestion: try to find an intensive outpatient program (IOP) with onsite childcare. IOPs are usually eight hour programs that often offer the same services as inpatient care except you don't stay overnight.  

If you need to go to the hospital to avoid leaving your child alone forever, then do it. Case managers in the hospital can help after you're better.",FluffyTootsieRoll,184srru

0,"It’s certainly possible that the report was lost, which is obviously frustrating and inconvenient. I’d be incredibly upset ana angry and all that fun stuff if that happened to me. Sometimes mistakes happen though. 

Alternatively, there is a chance that the report just isn’t ready yet. Generally initial psychiatric/psychological reports are quite in depth, and in my experience, it’s often slow getting the report. And maybe the provider you saw in the ER, is still referencing the original report to write their own report from your visit. 

No matter the reason, I would try contacting the ER or that hospital,s medical records department (or get your psychiatrist to request it) to see if something is started but not finalized or something. 

I had an experience where I had a pre-research study psychiatric assessment, and it took that doctor 8-9 months to get that report written and then sent to my general psychiatrist and GP. I sent the research centre a ton of emails asking about the status of the report. I think it ended up being  8-9 pages. But also apparently, his original administrative assistant left and it took them a while to find a new one (and she was responsible for transcribing the report from the dictation). 

All that to say, you’re well within your right to be frustrated and upset. This is very inconvenient. But it’s always possible that the report from your ER visit just isn’t ready yet. But there is a chance that someone somewhere goofed. 

Also, I’m not sure if it’s relevant or not, but I work in health care. We refer a lot of kids to psychiatrists and psychologists and those reports often take more time to be written and sent than other specialties.  

Am on mobile, sorry I apologize for formatting and spelling issues. ",poicephalawesome,9dxo3i
1,"I'm sorry that happened to you... I think anyone would be upset and feel very dismissed! (regardless of their emotional well being)  I think going online to write about it is already a good step in the right direction, (articulating your thoughts/feelings into words and venting). Also choosing to deal with this issue online rather than in person/call is a rational choice. At the end of the day, I think the goal is just to get to the bottom of what happened, to find out whether the doctor was actually careless, negligent or if it was an unfortunate mistake. You are taking appropriate steps to find out what happened, and trying to manage your emotional reaction in the process, which is very good. What outcome are you hoping for? I think if someone contacted you and directly explained what happened, with a sincere apology, you'd be able to feel validated and let go of some of the negative feelings. However, people are not always accountable, so if you don't get a proper explanation or apology, maybe you can consider seeing a new doctor who lets you feel like you are cared for? I wish you all the best, and I do think you are doing quite well in handling such a tough and hurtful situation! ",IcyMacaroon,9dxo3i
2,"I know the actual assessment report is complete and ready, because the assessing organisation gave it to me when I left. 

I understand that mistakes happen, but I guess my frustration is because the regular ER doctor got her notes in already, the IOP intake psych doctor put notes in, and the psych ER doctor saw me for about two minutes, but put nothing in. 

It seems wrong that she couldn't at least have someone send the actual report to my psychiatrist...since they're both in Kaiser...

I'm going to send a message to Kaiser, asking for follow-up. Maybe I can even get a message to the doctor who saw me. ",curious_bookworm,9dxo3i
3,"Thank you for the positive reinforcement! =)

I guess what I mostly want is 

A: confirmation as to the disposition of my private record (shredded, lost, on someone's desk).

B: for the staff to do better in the future with other patients (if this was a matter of negligence or carelessness)

C) an apology wouldn't hurt, but an apology without the other parts is kinda empty.

As for the doctor who may have misplaced the record, she's not my regular psychiatrist, so I'll probably not see her again anytime soon. Hopefully, it's like the other comment suggested where it's still ""in process,"" because that would mean they know where it is.

My name is pretty uncommon (I'm probably the only person living in this county with my last name). I can't possibly get mixed up with another person, so if someone saw it and recognized my name, I truly believe they'd see me differently. Luckily, I can't think of a scenario where that would actually happen.

Now if I still lived in the town where I grew up...this happening there could actually cause an issue. But it's not. So I'm just gonna file a complaint and hope that they're more diligent next time.",curious_bookworm,9dxo3i
4,"The report I was talking about was the the psychologist/psychiatrist report from when you were in the ER. But yeah, I can't *really* give you any answers about why that ER psych didn't send the ""actual assessment report"" from that separate organisation where it should have been sent (your psychiatrist). 

It does seem wrong that that original report was not sent to your psychiatrist. Maybe it was misplaced. Maybe it was accidentally shredded, or maybe the ER psych doc still has the report and wanted to keep it until they had their report done? Either way, I can empathise with what I think you're feeling. 

I maybe should have said that I live in Canada, so I'm not suuuuuper familiar with the way the US health care system works, but I think I have a basic understanding. My office uses a couple programs that give us access to any reports from certain hospitals in my province, and often times we can access the reports there much sooner than we received them via mail or fax. But despite that, the system does not show any reports until they're done. So maybe the ER doc's note is similar to that? (Still can't explain them not sending the original assessment report though). 

If you're able to contact Kaiser or that ER psych doc, do it. If they give you a hard time about giving you any information, ask your psychiatrist to try and get that information. 

I don't know if I'm making you more frustrated trying to blabber on, that is not my intention. I swear I'm trying to be helpful! ",poicephalawesome,9dxo3i
5,"You're welcome :)   


I can totally understand that fear of having your private information disclosed somewhere random. That would be extremely negligent on their part, and they should def have some kind of policy for confidentiality and protecting people's personal files. If your records were to be seen by anyone other than the doctors, you may even be able to sue for that! I think it's also great that you are concerned not only for your own files/confidentiality, but also with the well-being of other patients and protecting their confidentiality as well, not wanting something like this to repeat, not wanting someone to experience how shitty you felt. You understand first hand how hurtful and dismissive it feels and care enough to file a complaint and make a point about this kind of situation!  It must be horrible enough, as you mentioned being trapped in the ER and guarded, feeling so scared, and THEN to have to worry about your personal files being misplaced or possibly not even recorded properly? Thats adding insult to injury and you have every right to feel as angry as you do, so don't think your reaction is a result of ""emotional regulation issues"" - your emotions are very appropriate and reflective of how horrible this situation was.

I think I was like in a very, very bad mental state. I couldn't even speak to my parents right, because I was ashamed of my mental state. I could not even meet with friends, because they all saw how bad of a shape I was in, and it was beyond weird for them. I survived by just literally living day by day without perceiving my life at all during that time. I was kind of just in an unconscious mode, and I just pushed without having the slightest goal or aim in what I did day to day, but I just breathed the air that life gave me at the moment, and lived until the next day. Today, I may still not be in the best mental state, but I sure as hell am better than before. I'm taking online school, working, and I enjoy playing video games on my free time.

Do you mind if I ask what the arguments are about?

I am not a doctor or any kind of health professional, but I don't think you're suicidal because you can't find friends with no bad aspects or how much you hate the world or your desire to do what you want with no problems. I think you are suicidal because your pain is too damn severe and it won't stop. I think those 3 reasons you listed above are ways you think the pain could be decreased, but I don't think it is the main issue.

I am so sorry you are suffering. I think this is the main issue you face.

Have any of your therapists said you might suffer with depression? I ask because depression can make a person lose interest in everything.

2,"Wow.  Hey, I've been there.  On all sides of the psychiatric equation.  Sometimes I wanted to go . . . sometimes I was forced to go . . . sometimes went there via the emergency room . . . . 

I do have to point out however that I started to get better when I started listening to professionals.  If your therapist thinks you should go inpatient perhaps ask ""why"" and ponder the answer?  

I am a type A personality with some spectacular coping mechanisms.  I can appear fine real quick.  My therapist recognized that an inpatient environment would force me to work on some better coping skills and get some stability.  

Have had moments where I swore I wasn't suicidal or homicidal but a decade later looked back and went ""ooooh yeah maybe I was a little dicey but didn't realize it"". 

Feel free to message me!!  I have had over 6 long term stays and well over 10 emergency room visits that weren't quite a week but were more than 24 hours.

Secondly, it’s really a place (again my experience as a patient) to be observed and kept safe with minimal treatment.

12,"I am going to modify and repeat some advice that I have given.

I think your therapist is doing you a service. The internet is great but they are not invested in you. They will spout off advice and then go watch a Cat video. That being said reach out to me if you want, and this advice comes from years of experience living with bipolar. I have felt the way you do in a mania. At times I felt great and then it turned into a scary nightmare.  Your mind is your most valuable resource. More valuable than temporary freedom. I say temporary because you will get better and then have real freedom. On the other hand this could go bad very quickly and you want to have every advantage at your disposal. 

We live in a very individualistic culture and value freedom. However, this just makes it harder to make this decision on your own. It also makes it harder for others with those values to feel they have the necessity to interfere with your life. This means that ultimately you have to make the decision before something worse happens. You will get through this. 

As for how they will treat you, if you check yourself in you will be treated very well. More like a hospital gown. After about 3 days you will probably feel a lot better, but since it is your mental health if I were you I wouldn't care if it were three months. Three months recovery from an illness is a blessing. You can spend some of this time in the safe hospital and then go home and further your recovery. The advice and more importantly the treatment that you will get will start you on a long journey to recovery. If you need a metaphor, right now your like the Fat person at the gym, the hospital is your gym and doctor your trainer. If you do what they say when they say it and then also focus on your inner mental health you will be mentally healthy again. Remember that positive metaphor when you go. It's a health hospital.

15,"When I went, I wasn’t suicidal or homicidal either. It didn’t do much for me, but it was quite a long time ago and had more to do with my attitude and such. I think, as others have said, that much depends on the facility you’d be going to. It is good, in many ways, to get a bit of respite from the world at large and stay in a controlled and structured environment, even at the cost of your shoelaces and mobile phone. I’ve thought about checking myself in because I feel so overwhelmed. But, really, what would do the same, or likely better, for me and the way my mind works, the way I function, etc., is a retreat center. Someplace that does silent retreats out in the middle of nowhere would be my ideal. There’s still the basic structure of meal times. Some would offer group meditation times, yoga, or things of that ilk. It’s good to be with people without the stress of it. Where you can have the company without the complications. Just there to get away, decompress, and recenter yourself. Maybe that would be worth a look as an alternative. ",,aq7ce3
16,"To find a place I would check with your insurance or call 211. Talk to your therapist too as they would be a good resource.  If they're affiliated with an inpatient hospital they could reserve a bed for you. You might still have to go to the emergency department then transferred to inpatient. 
Inpatient is for people with symptoms that are acute in nature. Suicidal thoughts, psychosis, depression, severe anxiety, etc. It can also be used as almost a time out from life where the focus should solely be on you and getting your medication correct. 
It's understandable you don't want your laces and phone taken away. They do that for safety and treatment. Laces is a safety factor not just for you but the other residents so it's not personal. Not having your phone will suck but a lot of issues are cause by the phone. Taking it away will help you focus only on yourself.
There is some truth to people saying it's a trap. A lot of people go in expecting it to fix whatever is wrong without actually doing any of the treatment. Also be wary of some of the direct care support staff. They are generally minimally trained and some will be not be helpful maybe unintentionally harmful.
As with all types of treatment this is something you have to buy into. Going through the motions to get out will not be helpful. Treatment doesn't end when you're discharged it continues with outpatient care. Everyone I've seen that was successful focused on themselves, socialized but more in a polite manner rather than attempting to build new friendships, advocated for themselves, and took therapy/treatment seriously.",DinosAteSherbert,aq7ce3

My sister had a lot of the same symptoms as me. She was sure this would cure her and bring her clarity like it did for me. It didn’t and she spiraled into a deep depression cause her hope was high.

Adhd test is easy, you can Google it online. However being honest is the best in my opinion. Take the test again, however in the spare time work on crucial building blocks to help fight depression and anxiety. (Talking mentally).

11,"I take both with SSRIs with no problems. And I have a combination of meds that help me. There are drugs that are used for multiple issues. Like one for bipolar stabilizing moods can help with just depression. 

See a doctor that will answer your questions and is open to finding you a good combination of meds to treat your mood, which includes anxiety. If they say no, without even listening to you when you want to try something, maybe look for another doctor. Not one that prescribes anything, but one that listens to everything and then works with you. Research meds yourself and then bring them up. It’s good to be well informed.",modular-displacement,kw5akd

0,"Honestly I feel similar. I get that feeling of hate. I have it right now. It's more resentment than hate.

I was let into an IOP program in March only to be put into limbo and told not to come after the first orientation. My behavior apparently was what they felt was right for the program. Like. I'm sorry but if you promised a break please don't make it an issue that I asked for the break when it was due. 

They try to cut time for breaks so they can push content. Anyways. I felt alienated and shit. It was my adhd still is. However I saw a psychiatrist who had increase my dose of vyvanse to help me. Long story short he basically vouched that I should try going to the program again.

Today I got a call from one of the people from that group and she continued to dismiss my issues. Leaning toward the excuse that that's just how it is and there's more than you in the program. Anyways she got me so mad.

I cried then called the suicide hotline. I was not doing well I was nauseated. Also I was and kinda still am at work was really thinking of going home. Just kinda did my best not to talk to anyone or make eye contact. 

Anyways sorry for the story just wanted to say I relate to you. Hope you find peace in not being alone. Get well soon.",,14lgzt1

1,"I can relate, I’m a nursing major but I’ve taken a few psych classes. I’ve also been in and out of talk therapy psychiatry, and medication since I was 8 years old ( 12+ years ) and I never had any progress with any of it either. Talk therapy just made me uncomfortable, i’ve always been on the shy side. Psychiatrists don’t give you the time of day & medications always just made me feel foggy, spaced & numb. 

I’m sure therapy and medications work for some people, but sometimes I just think for some of us, it’ll always be like this. Especially because of capitalism. know you’re looking for success stories… but imo in 2022 USA, healthcare is a business you’re not meant to get better. The United States has some of the worst mental health related outcomes, including the highest suicide rate and second highest drug related death rate. They don’t want to see us get better, they just want our money. 

This might be an unpopular opinion, but we don’t need any more therapists charging $250+ an hour ( in this economy too!!? ) just to be no help.",Southern-Trouble603,zjk172
2,I wasn’t sure therapy worked for me until I got admitted to an IOP. It absolutely saved my life.,e_vee10,zjk172
3,"I wish I could post a success story, I just wanted to say I feel you. My major is Social Work and I thought I wanted to be a therapist. Or be in the mental health field in some capacity. The fact everyone I know in the field is burnt out or underpaid aside. It's not off the table for me, but my own experiences have turned me off to it lately. I will say when I've been in some dark moments having a helpline, anything to cling onto, was helpful...meaning therapy, but I'm not in those desperate dark times most of the time. It's certainly something. The rest of the time, I don't feel like I've benefited all that much. Venting about my problems on a regular basis to a stranger just doesn't really do that much for me. I've never really gotten much guidance from therapists, some nuggets I suppose, but nothing that's really stuck. I drank the kool-aid for a while and now I'm not buying the therapy gospel. I recently watched the documentary ""Stutz"" and wished I had a therapist like that, that's nothing like I ever experienced. The fact is there is a shortage of mental health professionals and not everyone can afford it. I'm hesitant to recommend it these days. As far as meds, I did a two year med trial with my primary bc I couldn't find a psych. It went badly and nothing worked. I did find a psych. at the end and I'm thinking of trying a new class of drugs, but I'm terrified it's going to go horribly again.",complicatedtooth182,zjk172
4,What were those techniques you mentioned?,Thick-Nebula-2771,zjk172
5,"You can see success stories here, also stories from people who said they were not helped by therapy.  
  
What does recovery mean? I think a good measure is a client's gratitude. I often mention Emma Seppala's pioneering work with PTSD cases, success with one week of treatment that was simply slow breathing.  
  
One of the participants told Seppala, ""Thanks for giving me my life back.""  
  
This is what I would tell an aspiring therapsist -  
  
Stephen Ilardi, the therapist and researcher who developed a depression program based on lifestyle research, said, ""I believe in fighting depression with everything we have. But if we only fight with medicine, we're not going to win.""  
  
With everything we have -  
  
Suppose you could win a prize by hitting a target with an arrow and the arrows were free. If somebody asked. “How many arrows do you want?” you wouldn’t say, “Which is the best one?” You’d say, “How many can I have?”  
  
The beauty of self-help is that you have a variety of low cost, low risk things that can be combined with each other, and with standard treatments with office visits. While it's not clear at this time that any one of these things is as effective as an antidepressant, it's common sense that if a variety of reasonably good things are combined with each other, they will have considerable effect.  
I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.

1,"I'd suggest an IOP (intensive outpatient) or PHP (partial hospitalization) program if you want to spend more time focusing on your mental health. These usually include a few hours a week or more where you go to group therapy, individual therapy, and a psychiatrist. They often have specific groups for EMDR, trauma, and other specific groups. 

I was in an IOP and it helped me so much. It helped me learn what I needed to work on and actually gave me a direction to go with in therapy.",mxbean,8tm75e
2,"Well, is just that I've heard about things like EMDR and I thought that maybe it could be beneficial to try it in my situation.

Also, because some problems are related to what I want to do in life and find what really makes me feel happy I think I need more time to talk about it.",draklhelis,8tm75e

0,"Here is my two cents

**You state here**: *It started very suddenly in September of 2020 for what I assume was me lagging behind on schoolwork because I walked into the lions' den by starting to play video games during breaks, which then little by little grew until I was faced with more assignments than I was used to (in retrospect it was only like 3 late ones which to me feels pathetic now lol but it was so overwhelming at the time that I avoided it and it grew exponentially). Ever since that relatively small event I felt like there was something wrong with me, like something clicked:*

This sounds to me like an **inner perfectionist/critic** that created **anxiety** that you then used avoidance ( video games) till you got overwhelmed and it created a cycle. At the root of OCD is anxiety. The OCD is the way the brain avoids the anxiety with magical thinking. 

You cant ignore it because it wont go away but you can dismantle the cognitive distortions that are creating the loop and rein in your anxiety and inner gremlins.

&#x200B;

good luck !",strange-seraphim,13llgz5
1,"Haha my inner gremlins lol.

I wonder if it's possible to deflate the perfectionistic and OCD tendencies to a normal, healthy level permanently (assuming I don't artificially create it again, but I think even average Joe's can create anxiety through nurture). I hear a lot that my problem will forever be there and I just need to cope, but that sounds like bs to me, like they think it's just a gene or that upbringing is permanent.

Also thanks for portraying it as dismantling the thought loop, many have described it as ignoring it until it goes away and that never say right with me. I guess the way forward is a gradual disassembly of the previous OCD tendency, with the help of meds for a little while, until I'm back to a new normal where I have a stronger resilience to perfectionism and am more carefree.

Thanks for the swift reply friend and have a great day/night!",itsLantik,13llgz5
2,"I have anxiety and use to be avoidant but avoidance in anticipation of anxiety is like the opposite of what is helpful- we do the hard thing in small increments to show ourselves we don't need to be anxious or that we can trust ourselves to do the hard thing and be ok.  Like exposure therapy and building self trust and resilience. Take it slow, give yourself compassion. I don't know about a lifetime but these things can be like playing wack a mole hahaha- we can think we beat it and it creeps in somewhere else. So diligence and yes, really looking to deconstruct the cognitive distortions- there are some good infographics on cognitive distortions and how to reframe them online- you have a great day/night- heck have a great life.

Technically I do have a diagnosis (that I only found out cuz she wrote it down on my neurologist referral) it's other mixed mood disorder or/and behavioral disorder, which is a real ICD diagnosis but isn't helpful to understand what's going on.

3,"I dont know but I think its OCD and ADHD. Right now im really frustrated and angry that my brain always starts thinking of conversations and responses to situations and thoughts that don't make any sense or have anything to do with me. All I do all day is use the internet and go on websites because its the only way I know how to escape from these thoughts coming up again and relax. I'm so bored of being on the internet and doing nothing with my life but I don't know if i'm justified in participating in such a aimless and wasteful existence because it's true that i'm never going to be happy and satisfied so I might as well choose the easiest and most comfortable way to survive while I can, or if I'm just making everything worse by giving up too easily.

either way I start IOP again tomorrow so i'll at least be able to talk to some mental health professionals and start going outside again. the same building for my IOP appointment also has a pharmacy so if I email my psychiatrist and he decides to prescribe something i will be able to pick the medication up in the same trip. 

I forgot to mention that by now i've already tried almost every medication I can for anxiety depression and ADHD and nothing really helps so that is a big part in me thinking my life is over and that I have no ability to grow for any self improvement",,et8eo3

0,My therapist mentioned it but I didn't ask any follow up questions. What is it?,nothingduploading,7zl1lb
0,"Hi! These are all great questions to ask a new therapist. Some others to consider:

* How long are most of your clients in therapy with you for?
* How can I contact you if I'm experiencing an emergency?
* What is your policy on missed/cancelled sessions?

Others probably have more good ones to consider as well.

For your first appointment, you should keep in mind that you'll probably spend a lot of time with the therapist asking very specific questions about you, your history, your previous treatment, your family, your education, and so on. This helps them form a more complete picture to figure out how best to help you. But sometimes it can feel more like an interrogation. This isn't the way regular therapy sessions usually play out (though for some philosophies/approaches to therapy, it can be similar) though, so hang in there!

In your first session, it'll be a lot closer to 50/50 as far as who is talking, and a lot more ""closed"" as opposed to open in what kinds of questions are being asked. The therapist will ""drive"" the conversation. In more regular sessions, you'll be doing a lot more of the talking than your therapist will, and things will be steered mostly where you want to take them.

Hope your process of finding someone works out well :)",schm1547,5n2bx8

2,"Given what you wrote, I suggest reading all of the following, as you will be a lot more ""educated consumer"" when you interview these people. 

I was severely abused as a small child and grew up with a nasty case of [C-PTSD](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=c-ptsd) pretty much like every *other* borderline I have ever run into (which is now over 100). I am not responsible for my disease, but I am responsible for my recovery. This is how I did it:

1) Medications, but *only if really needed* to get one stabilized enough to do the next six things on this list: After wasting a lot of time with people who didn't know what they were doing, I found a board certified psychopharmacologist in my area by using the clinician locator on the *Psychology Today* website.

I was severely abused as a small child and grew up with a nasty case of [C-PTSD](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=c-ptsd) pretty much like every *other* borderline I have ever run into (which is now over 100). I am not responsible for my disease, but I am responsible for my recovery. This is how I did it:

1) Medications, but *only if really needed* to get one stabilized enough to do the next six things on this list: After wasting a lot of time with people who didn't know what they were doing, I found a board certified psychopharmacologist in my area by using the clinician locator on the *Psychology Today* website.

0,"Well, since we're making a list, other alternatives you could try are...

Evidence based individual psychotherapies:

* Classic cognitive behavioural therapy
* Cognitive dialectical therapy
* Acceptance and Commitment therapy

Humanistic-approach individual psychotherapies:

* Gestalt therapy (Although you have to avoid Fritz' Gestalt, which is rather culty, and work with Laura Perls' Gestalt, which sticks to its philosophical foundations)
* Transactional Analysis
* Eclectic humanistic therapy

Systemic therapies

* Systemic individual psychotherapy
* Narrative therapy
* Constructive therapy
* Systemic family therapy (Requires your family to be in therapy, no just you though) in its different modalities: Minuchin's, Palo Alto's etc.

Other psychiatric treatments

* Electro-convulsive therapy (Which is not at all like in the movies: you're not going to get strapped and electrocuted to unconsciousness  against your will, it's a lot milder- the objetive is to help you, after all.)

Other mental health practices:

* Mindfulness training.
* Other forms of meditation.
* Yoga.
* Buddhist ""psychotherapy"" (It not really psychology so I don't think it should be classified as psychotherapy, hence the quotation marks, but it's not necessarily a bad thing)
* Other forms of religious counselling

There may be a few others. Freemasonry did wonders for my mental health, although it is not really focused on mental health and it's not meant to ""heal"" or ""rectify"" anyone, but rather make good people even better. Still an option though.

Also, judging by your list I'm 99.9% sure you've already tried working on diet and water intake, but just in case, work on your nutrition if you haven't already.

There are other ""alternatives"" out there which are outright dangerous though, so **make sure to avoid**:

* Family constellation therapies.
* Naturopathic care
* MMS or any other alternative ""medicine"" product.
* Auditing, and all other derivatives from Dianetics of Scientology.
* Fringe religious practices and ""esoteric/occult"" practices- you'll run a severe risk of falling into a cult, and that's going to make it worse. Examples of cults that sometimes promise to be a mental-health cure-all are Mission church international, Jehova's wittnesses, Scientology, Samael Au Weor's Gnostisism and a few others.
* Spiritual retreats or psychotherapeutical retreats (The first tends towards cultish behavior, the latter towards quackery and exploitation)

I hope any of this helps.",,b9qqyq
1,"I'm frankly very impressed that you remember all of them.  It's sad, yes, but also very impressive.

As for what to try, the only other options are illegal psychadelic medications.  Things like mdma, lsd, psilocybin.  Obviously it's illegal to do these drugs, and probably against the rule for me to suggest them, but you appear to have exhausted previous options.

It's not profitable to study this combination since both medications are very cheap, but if you're desperate for something new and different, it couldn't hurt to send to your psychiatrist and see if it could help at least marginally.

The initial results for the trial tested on humans were very promising for the treatment of depression, especially in cognition and motivation.

Edit: I'm currently on 22.5mg mirtazapine and 187.5mg of venlafaxine/effexor, and the norepinephrine effects aren't supposed to show up until about 150mg. I had barely any reaction to Effexor for both anxiety and depression until about 150mg, so it is possible you may need to ride out the side effects for a month or so and increase gradually to a more therapeutic dosage.

If there are any hospitals near you with a decent behavioral health wing, they might be running an IOP that you could take part in.

2,"First look into your insurance. Call the number on the back of your card, or go online to see what your insurance covers. Find a place you like the best, and give them a call. Tell them what's going on, and that you'd like to start some services. They will schedule an intake with you, where you get to meet a therapist and figure out what's going on, and what kind of help would be best.

If you don't have insurance, this is what you do.

1. Get insurance.
2. See above steps.

If you really don't feel like getting insurance, find some therapeutic services close to you and call them. Ask them if they take out-of-pocket clients, and set up an intake with them.

Outpatient services mean you will go and see a therapist.
Inpatient services mean you will go and stay somewhere for a while and see a therapist.
In-home services means a therapist comes to your home and works with you.
Meds help a lot of people. Look into that if you want.
Group is group. You know what group is.

There are tons of different types of therapy. Finding the ones you like best is key.

1,"I was recently inpatient at a facility in PA named Malvern. I am currently in IOP in NJ. My inpatient experience was actually very pleasant. It was my first time. I was put in by crisis so I didn’t go in on my own. My first few days were very rough. Missing home, panic attacks, crying spells, depression, and a lot of self-isolation. After that I slowly became accustomed to the daily schedule of groups, meals, and dr appointments. Everyone was around my age group and the facility only houses up to 22 patients. I found my time there very helpful. Seeing the psychiatrist everyday helps with medication management and they can see what works and what doesn’t. Also, all of the employees are trained in handling many situations so they were always there for me to talk to at anytime of day. (I even had a session with someone at 3am). When I was discharged I finally felt like myself. I made lasting friendships that are continued support for me. It’s crazy how much I learned about myself and new activities I enjoy. I will say in a psych ward or mental facility things are always bound to happen due to everyone being in different mental states. We did have a few instances but nothing to crazy. No fights, threats, accidents, or anything dire. 

I will (unfortunately) be admitted again according to my IOP program for medication management. This is not due to my inpatient experience. This is because my medication was changed drastically after being discharged by my new IOP psychiatrist. This has caused a spiral in my bipolar and depression, even causing GI issues. I am hoping to go to the same facility but it’s not always a guarantee. 

One thing I suggest: DO YOUR RESEARCH
some facilities are much different from others. Try and find one that has a smaller patient capacity. Also, if I were you I would look for one specifically for medication management. Read reviews as well. Some places are very large and deal with a wide variety of patient ages, disorders, and backgrounds. 

I definitely suggest to try it out. Just know that you are doing this for you. Good luck and I hope all gets better. If you have any further or more in detail questions, I’d be glad to answer.",prollyhighaf,nuu0fw

If you're having trouble finding an antidepressant that works, you could ask about adding a mood stabilizer. Mood stabilizers aren't just for bipolar. The ones that are also ant-epileptic are also used to treat major depressive disorder and treatment resistant depression. Lamictal and Trileptal are two that I've used over the years.

0,"There's a very interesting treatment people in the US and UK are talking about that's been used in Europe and Japan since the 1970s.  When you hear about it, you might think it's bogus because it sounds so simple, but it's been approved by the FDA for chronic pain, insomnia, depression and anxiety.  CES - cranioelectric stimulation therapy - NOT to be confused with ""shock treatment"" - it makes use of very small pulses of electricity with a device powered by two AA batteries - like a TV remote. It's available in the UK without prescription. The FDA, expressing concern about possible seizure risk, has put it in the by-prescription class, although a review by the National Research Council found no significant side effects. Painless. Information about devices like the Alpha Stim 100 is available
on the Internet. You Tube has videos with physicians interviewed.  One video you could watch is a local news report with a pain specialist interviewed.  Search with ""alpha stim 100 orlando news.""  I'd be sure to get the right model. That company has more than one.  But you might get treated at a clinic, which is cheaper. 

You may have heard about mindfulness therapy.  You can learn about Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction with a book or audiobook, but my guess is you'd want to take the eight-week course. You Tube video ""How mindfulness can change your life"" from the Univ of Massachusetts Medical School - 1/2 hour program explains it all, mentions the self-help book. MBSR is offered at 100s of clinics all over the country.

MBSR should not be confused with the meditation class at the YMCA that just teaches mindfulness. If you want a comparison, google the summary of ""The Effects of Mindfulness Meditation: A Meta-Analysis"" by Eberth and Sedlmeir.

There are good lifestyle therapies for depression other than exercise.  A therapist and researcher who's studied this is Stephen Ilardi of the Univ of Kansas. Book - Depression Cure.

3,"I appreciate it so much. I had heard of CES in passing but never looked into it, which I will. I bet my pain therapist has one or can get me to one pretty easily (I am in the US).  I've also heard great things about mindfulness therapy, but I'm running into a ton of YMCA classes and not much else in my area. But you're right that that's something I should be more proactive about. 

I'll be looking into everything you said. Thank you so much. ",itsacalamity,31xha4
4,"I appreciate it, but I'm severely limited in what I can do in terms of ""very serious, rigorous exercise"" and I've done physical therapy multiple times as well. I do yoga and stretching daily, and walk. That is about the extent of my capabilities right now. ",itsacalamity,31xha4
5,"To the best of my knowledge, the Alpha Stim 100 - the one you see in the Orlando news report - is the only CES device used for pain relief, and I believe that company makes two models, one of which is made for pain relief.  There's one other company that's about as well-known, Fisher-Wallace, but their device seems to be only for mood disorders and insomnia.  If you can't get help at a clinic, you can buy your own.  Insurance is not especially easy, although I've heard some companies cover it partially.  

Amazon has an audiobook by Jon Kabat-Zinn, the founder of MBSR you see interviewed in the Univ of Mass program - Mindfulness Meditation for Pain Relief: Guided Practices for Reclaiming Your Body and Your Life.  This might be as good for you as MBSR if not better.  Anyway, remember what the research says about the YMCA.  

Jon Kabat-Zinn is a fine teacher, he's first-rate at taking students through exercises.  The only thing I'd caution you about is that you might not go for the too-too poetic, philosophical language he uses to introduce the exercises.  If he strikes you as artsy-fartsy, just ignore that stuff and go with the exercises, which are great.

There's something I hesitate to mention, not because it's not good but because some have criticicized it as overrated.  If you read the Biofeedback article on Wikipedia, you'll find a lot of pro and very little con, except that some question its cost-effectiveness.  You could ask your pain specialist about biofeedback as a means of learning mindfulness, but that audiobook I mentioned might be as good and much cheaper.

The Ilardi book gives you lifestyle things that are mostlty very easy.   You could start with things that call for no effort at all - fish oil capsules and bright light exposure.  About exercise, you'd want to talk with your doctor about this, but you might be surprised at how little exercise can have an effect on your mood.

edit - spelling",SamuelColeridgeValet,31xha4
6,"I've actually done biofeedback and of all the ""woo"" alt treatments I've tried, it helped the most (and actually *was* covered by my insurance. 

I have to put in an amazon order for some other stuff later today, I will pick up some of the stuff you've suggested. It would be great if insurance covered everything but if not, I'm not opposed to dropping a little cash on something if there's a good reason, y'know?

Overall, just thanks. I looked at an IOP program and it was just not what I needed, and I'm kind of at a loss. This is a help. ",itsacalamity,31xha4

I had to do a whole purge because I would do basically what you said and it cause a year long manic episode and that landed me in the hospital. I attempted suicide after a really embarrassing drunk encounter with him and I thought there was no point in living anymore.

That whole year leading up to the attempt I put on this show of pretending I was okay and I felt on top of the world. And by on top of the world I mean: abusing my ambien and klonopin prescription, drinking to the point of blacking out, messaging and calling him sober and not sober, telling people how awful he is and how much better I deserve when in reality I was manipulative. He did do a lot of shitty things but I was for sure at fault but for that whole year I was in denial and it was a lot easier to just hate him

It’s been a year since I got out of IP and yes I’ve relapsed (ED)  this past year but my mood is a lot more stable. I am trying to get better, but for myself.

It gets better if you try to move forward. For me work was a really good distraction.

0,"I'm on a phone so I apologize if I don't get to all questions. I work at an emergency psych clinic. To answer a few of your questions...

Our facility has a 16 bed unit with no separation of sexes. Some facilities do segregate sexes, others do not.
Our facility allows patches, some we contact with allow smoking.
If your state and level of acuity are anything like the hospitals I have experience with, chances are the only items you will be allowed to bring are clothes and maybe books. All food, toiletries, towels, etc are provided. Most likely no vaping. 
Check in will be reading you rights and consent forms, you signing forms, documenting your belongings that you have on you, and reading you the rules.
Be prepared to not be able to have belts, shoelaces, hats, wired bras, our anything that someone might use to harm themselves with. I would recommend velcro or slip on shoes, no jackets or pants with draw strings. 
No hospital with treat trans as a diagnosis, that's a lawsuit waiting to happen if they did. If you have anxiety over your experiences as trans they may treat your anxiety but that would be attempting to help you cope rather than change you fundamentally. They may not have you share a room with other clients depending on room availability and to ensure all patients are comfortable. 
Duration of stay varies according to client need. If you're doing well and have responded positively to treatment, many psychiatrists are open to your request to discharge within a reasonable amount of time. You may be in for as few as 2-3 days or as much as 2 weeks depending on your needs. 
Also, do not be afraid of dealing with people who are incredibly high acuity, they are often placed on separate units so as to not upset other patients who are more calm. You will likely be on a unit with people who are as rational as you are.

I'll leave the response at that and hope it helps. I'm in Texas so some aspects of treatment and policies may be different. I also don't have full details regarding your situation and I'm not familiar with your state's policies on treatment nor do I know what type of facility you're going to. My info is based off only those inpatient facilities that I have experience with. PM or comment below if you have anything more specific to ask and I'll attempt to follow up in a timely manner.

Good luck and good for you for seaking treatment. Often it will allow you a breather from current stresses, allow you time to calm down and think rationally about your triggers and symptoms, and let you return home with fresh insight into managing those symptoms through medication and understanding how your behavior affects your ability to cope and feel good.

2,"One nice thing about being trans I have experienced in the mental health system is always getting my own room.  They were really accepting of my trans status too.  Usually you cant smoke, but one of the hospitals I went to let people go to a closed in area outside to smoke.  They do provide nicotine patches/gum as necessary.  Friends brought me my ipad when I was in the hospital and that was allowed.  ",Maddisonic,45ipqz
3,"What do you think you need inpatient for?  Inpatient is usually for dyer emergencies.   

If this isn't a life or death emergency, I might recommend that you look for residential treatment or IOP instead.  The reason I say that is inpatient psychiatric facilities don't really tailor your care to your specific needs.  It's basically just a hospital ward where you hang out and go to generic groups and maybe see a psychiatrist once every few days.  You won't get an individual therapist or anything like that.  You'll basically be paying just to hang out there for a few days while they adjust your meds. 

I think you are far better off looking for a residential place or IOP that is specific to your needs.  The hospital usually doesn't provide very good treatment.  That's not what it's for.",pricklycoconut,45ipqz

Plus the whole being autistic thing means I'd benefit from having a quiet, ""safe"" place to retreat to.

I should be able to live without nicotine and wifi, but what can I say :p I expect that it'll be ridiculously hard work if I have to go in, and I could do with some creature comforts like that.

Good question, and perhaps there is no exact right answer. If it is still affecting you to this day, then I think it could be a good idea to seek professional help. You could also educate yourself more on PTSD and try to raise awareness/money for this condition, so you can use your bad experiences for good, by helping others who have experienced similar trauma's in their life.

Some murders occur as a result of people starting to believe/give in to the voices, so it is dangerous if they are telling you to hurt anyone and the safest place for you and others would be in a mental hospital until they can get the voices to stop/lessen.

Maybe it would help you to type out a message in your notes to send to your friends when they reach out but you don’t feel up to replying? Something simple that you can copy/paste like “Hey, I see your message and I’m not ignoring you. I’m tired/not feeling well/not up to responding/not in a good head space/etc.” Share however much you feel comfortable sharing with them and thank them for supporting you and understanding that you cannot respond right now.

0,">I've been dealing with anxiety, depression, agoraphobia and *probably a mood disorder*

Depression is a mood disorder so I'm not sure what you're trying to say here.

Look, as u/dpbliss said, it's not likely you're going to change anyone's mind about how sick you are.  The fact is that those intensive IOP programs aren't really any different than once a week therapy, except that the advantage is they don't interfere with your life so much.

IOP isn't really any more ""serious"" of a treatment than once a week therapy.  It is for people who are so lacking in coping skills that they are completely unable to function.  If you are thinking a more intensive program will make you  feel better faster, you are wrong.  They are for people who have no skills.  Think of it like a class in how to live with depression, not a treatment.

Understand that they see a LOT of people and many of them are worse off than you.  I know how invalidating it is to hear that but it's kind of true.  You want relief for your symptoms and you think this program will bring it but it won't.  If they've assessed that you are better off once a week, then trust that they are right.  The more intensive treatment isn't always the better one.",pricklycoconut,3ha5ju
1,"I'd recommend against putting your hopes into convincing your social worker and doctor your symptoms are more severe than they think they are.  These people probably have to triage patients based on severity of symptoms, and there may be patients who need the IOP program more than you do right now.  These programs tend to be understaffed and hard to get insurance to cover.  I don't mean to belittle your symptoms -- but keep in mind that however bad your symptoms get, there are people out there who have it worse.  (This is something I'm constantly reminding myself.)

You say you've tried a lot of different treatment approaches.  My question is, what's worked?  Anything?  I find that when the shit really hits the fan for me, I need to go to DBT-style distress tolerance.  The general idea with this (in case you aren't familiar with it) is that you're living with distress, it's not likely to go away any time soon, and, despite that, you have to find a way to carry on.  Treat yo'self, so to speak.  If being in a structured program is what would make you feel good right now, then design one for yourself: Make a schedule of activities for the day.  You might do art therapy in the morning (color in a book), eat lunch at a cafe, go for a jog in the afternoon, and meditate at night.  I don't know.  Whatever works for you.  Whatever you can handle.  Maybe working through a book of CBT exercises or something like that.

Take it day by day, get what you can from your doctors, and chances are, as you find what works for you and what doesn't, things will gradually improve.

> it's time for serious treatment

I hate to break it to you, but I've been to an IOP program, and it isn't any more serious (or different, really) than what you've already had.

Good luck!",,3ha5ju
2,"I'd ask if the program would be available to you as an alternative to hospitalization if the one day a week program was unsuccessful and you began to deteriorate again. I'd hope that they'd be willing to try anything to avoid a re-hospitalization but it'd give you the chance to try creating your own program as the other reply suggested in conjunction with the anti-anxiety program. If that seems impossible to you, stress to the Social Worker that you only see a hospitalization in your very near future with such a non-intensive program. If you are already feeling as though you may hurt yourself or commit suicide please call an emergency service, 911 if you're in the US, or at least tell the Social Worker that tomorrow if you're not in immediate danger, it may lead to another hospitalization but your safety is all that matters. It would be highly unethical for you to be given no choice in your own treatment plan. ",Mspizzu,3ha5ju
3,"> those intensive IOP programs aren't really any different than once a week therapy

The difference is that in the IOP programs, you're in a group of other patients.  OP, if you want that social interaction, you can always search meetup.com for mental-health support groups.  The Depression Bipolar Support Alliance has great support groups nation-wide.

> Understand that they see a LOT of people and many of them are worse off than you. I know how invalidating it is to hear that but it's kind of true.

One perspective is to see this as invalidating, but another is to feel grateful.  OP, you're definitely dealing with some difficult shit.  If you need some empathy right now -- which you're totally entitled to -- I think you're likely to find it at a support group.  But take some solace in the fact that things could be worse: Your neurovegetative symptoms could be so bad you can't even bring yourself to speak or get out of bed.  You could be hearing voices chronically.  I'm not trying to suggest that mental illness is about one-up-manship, but in our society, where it's so difficult for people to get the treatment they need, patients like us are best off taking care of ourselves -- as opposed to trying to convince other people to take care of us.  That said, definitely don't stop being an advocate for yourself.  Working to get the right fit with a doctor *is* taking care of yourself.",,3ha5ju

That said, it is customary to allow for two weeks (which your post indicates is the time game were liking at?) For medication to take true effect.

I'm sorry you're in this spot. Try to hang on; it seems like you already have at least some of the awareness necessary to manage your mental health",ergotofwhy,djp9hq
1,"You know I used to be in your shoes. I’ve been struggling with mental health for 18 years and it was until I was jailed with no one to bail me out that I asked God for guidance. I don’t want this to be a come to Jesus story. I’m just saying it’s been several years and the state is still struggling to find me help. The doctors don’t know. However, I’m barely medicated ( I don’t take what the doctors recommend) and I live a quiet, patient life. I live alone with two dogs. I got tired of doctors telling me to do this or that. So I talk to God all day alone in my house. He talks back which I don’t consider unusual because I am after all psychotic. But I live a peaceful life. I don’t cut but once this year back in July. Even then it looked like I knicked myself shaving. I don’t have suicidal thoughts. I’m not aggressive. I get my basic needs met. My life has become so much better since I decided to talk about it. He hears your every thought. Even if you go through the phase of screaming for help like I did, you get it out. Be warned I live in the country so I can do that. I don’t suggest it if you’re in an apartment. Crazy people talk to themselves all the time. You might as well start a conversation with somebody that’ll listen. And I don’t mean to brag but I’m actually a lot better off than what I’M even mentioning. It’s all because I started talking to thin air and crazy or not it started answering back. Hope that helps.",spicytunafoil,djp9hq

3,"Definitely stop. Even though psychiatrists have professional training, you never know who might have been zoning out in class and may have missed some important details. Depending on your dosage, it may be fine to stop cold turkey! I don’t feel appropriate making recommendations since I’m not a professional, but you can break up your pills in order to wane off of them and my doctors have usually recommended doing it in increments of 5 mg. Look into Zoloft, it’s very similar. It really helped my step sister after she had a hard time with Lexapro. Hope u feel better <3",klinfinity,djp9hq
4,"Wow Ive been hearing a lot about Lexapro and suicidal thoughts. You’re doing such a good job looking out for yourself! Sounds like you know what needs to happen. Look into whatever options may be possible, if you’re in the US call your insurance for different provider options, or look into an online service, or a family services agency (like a religious or govt agency). And most importantly go all out with the self-care right now till you get through this withdrawal and everything. Good luck!",rainbowtoaststudios,djp9hq
5,"Antidepressants often cause suicidal ideation and higher risk of suicide in the first few weeks. It affects your body first. You still have the disordered thoughts, but your body is more motivated and energic, so it's easier to physically do it. 

In my experience, antidepressant is a crutch, that helps your body so you can get your circumstances and mind in order. 

The doctor failed to inform you about what to expect, what can you do to cope, and also failed miserably by triggering you so hard. 

I have quit an SSRI cold turkey after a month because I was nauseated all the time and vomited every few days, the withdrawal was nothing compared to that.

Edit: For some meds, it can take several weeks for side effects to subsidize, so it's not uncommon for psychiatrists to try to wait some more.

My current med (lamotrigine) made my life hell in the first two months. We were upping the dosage every two weeks. As soon as the side effects were starting to go away, we upped it and they came back. When we stopped at a dosage, it settled down, and I have zero side effects now. I'm happy that my psychiatrist told me to not give up yet.",SilverfishAnarchy,djp9hq
