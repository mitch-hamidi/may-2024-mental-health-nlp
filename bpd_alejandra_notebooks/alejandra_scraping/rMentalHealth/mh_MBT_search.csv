1,I feel like therapy isn‚Äôt helping me,"I was in a fantastic therapy. MBT, separate from my child. Then I was in a DV situation and social services are given all information I discuss in therapy. Unethical (to me) but not illegal. I‚Äôve honestly kinda gone backwards. 

I have BPD, I‚Äôm going to write a book on it (mainly for myself but maybe I‚Äôll self publish it as I‚Äôve always wanted to do that). I feel like it may help, getting it all down on paper but seeing work I can also be proud of.",1672700748.0,False,1,3,justhereinitlol,None,101qrai,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/101qrai/i_feel_like_therapy_isnt_helping_me/
2,Helping a friend look for a therapist,"Pls dm me if you have any resources 

‚ÄúI'm currently looking for a therapist well-experienced with treatment for individuals with BPD and complex trauma (my preferred approaches is integrated therapy with a strong focus on DBT&MBT).

I was recently diagnosed with BPD and cPTSD, I am also struggling with attention deficiency, body-tension and seasonal affective disorder. I have years of experiences of meditation and self-treatment with CBT. I've recently started using DBT, RO-DBT and MBT, I like to be well-informed, the research papers of said therapy treatments are more than welcome if shared by therapist. I'm an atheist, my view is mostly rational mysticism as I've experienced altered states of consciousness in my meditation practice. My most recent favorite work is that of Daniel Ingram's.

I'm pansexual, I have a history of being verbally and sexually abused, the trauma of which is what's affecting my functionality mostly. ‚Äú",1606865021.0,False,1,1,hgao40,None,k4wus5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/k4wus5/helping_a_friend_look_for_a_therapist/
3,BPD,"Hi guys, so recently I have been re-diagnosed with depression and anxiety and also a lot of 'borderline personality disorder' symptoms. So I do not have the impulsive symtoms, only like emotional instablity, manupulative behavior and black and white thinking.
Soon I'll be starting MBT treatment aswell.

I was wondering: does anyone here have experience with mentalisation based therapy (MBT)? Also, I have difficulty making and liking friends, is that common with BPD?

Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è",1557077573.0,False,2,0,parapiri,None,bl0i8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/bl0i8f/bpd/
4,I am so frustrated because I feel the Psychotherapy team aren't listening to me,"A little over a year ago I had my first psychotherapy assessment (which then turned into three sessions of assessments). This was after chasing the NHS for another whole year before I got the assessment in the first place. Then, after my assessment, I was put onto a six-week course in Mentalization-based Therapy to see if I'd like it. Alright, cool, I'll give it a go.

Then I had a meeting to determine if I wanted to continue. I did not. I originally requested individual long term, but was given the impression that I could do MBT or nothing. I then had a series of meetings where we started off with ""Has what you wanted changed? No? Okay we will have our team meeting and get back to you.""

Three meetings later, and we haven't got anywhere.

&#x200B;

They called me again today, with the same sort of thing. I said that if the only options are MBT or nothing, I'll have MBT. Oh no well we COULD do individual/group but there's a really long wait. Or we could redo the six week course when we can meet face to face (no).

Right. So what I said I wanted over a YEAR ago which wasn't ""right for me"" now suddenly is and I need to wait ANOTHER YEAR?

I ended up telling her I am sick of stressing about having no support, and I needed a decision today. I said I can't wait any longer.

Four initial assessment sessions, a six-week course, three additional meetings, multiple phone calls, and they STILL don't know what to do with me. She's calling me back tomorrow but I am so unbelievably sick of this now.

I'm stressed because I fall under the umbrella of ""you're too sick for this but not sick enough for this"" and if the lower levels won't see me (due to a diagnosis they are not equipped to deal with - fair play tbh I have no grudges there) and psychotherapy won't see me, how sick do I need to get before I can get some form of mental health support? They also said they would put me forward for ASD screening a few months ago and that hasn't been done either (the wait is super long which is fine, it makes no odds to me, but I haven't been put on the list yet).

I understand that I am the therapeutic version of The Undateables (as someone put it to me today) and that I'm a pain in the ass who doesn't fit nicely into a box. That doesn't mean, however, that I am not worth listening to. Now I am stressed that maybe they're not listening because I am not communicating properly my needs? I don't know. I feel nobody's listening to me today - my family, my bf? (I don't know what to put here because this is a separate issue which is causing me stress). So maybe if the whole world smells like it's not listening, maybe I'm the one who is shit.",1612364844.0,False,6,5,lawraa,None,lbpj03,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/lbpj03/i_am_so_frustrated_because_i_feel_the/
5,Therapy is coming to an end and I feel so scared that it hurts.,"Using a random throw away account just because I feel like  my main is too... associated with me?  So no post history, sorry.

I have borderline personality disorder and anxiety disorders. I have undertaken my first ever therapy which lasts 18 months, with the therapy being mentalisation based therapy (MBT). I have therapy goals and all that and now it's my last 3 months.

With this being my first ever therapy the closer the end date the less capable I start to feel. In the UK, it was a fight for me to get into this type of therapy and to be diagnosed. So the idea of 'what comes next' is so terrifying because I know there are still things I need to address or do.

 No one said this shit would be easy but just till completly I hate myself and while I've learn a lot about relationships and chilling the fuck out I feel like a bunch of other stuff Still remains. I'm not using this is useless just that I'm not... ready.

Note that I have been keeping up with the work and out of 18 months I have only misses 2 sessions and I'm never late. Even with this, my intrusive thoughts and relationship with myself is.. rocky still.

Finding out I'm nerodivernt (dyslexia and dypraixa) was one of the most important things for me as it explains a lot of my childhood issues.  Yet I am still so confused in what I...am? 

I am someone that gets assurance from labels and it allows me to read about and communicate things that may affect me.

If there is one thing that is so hard, it is the overlap in so many conditions and  my unbreakable shell and lack of confidence in everything I do and say.

I try to stay strong for my family but I want to live for myself and not always others. For me personally I find that I wake up and everything moves at 10000 miles an hour and then because of my low confidence I just mask it.ive done it my whole life. Mask that I didn't remember what you just said or get so distracted that I'll go and do something else.

6,Don't give up on yourself.... you do matter !,"The mental health system is stuffed. It has no answers for your feelings and the emotions you feel. And they are real feelings. 
I am not a Dr or a psychiatrist. I am a nurse. I know and feel emotional issues and the crisis feelings that come along. Talking to a close friend yesterday¬† and we share everything we spoke about how you guys. The younger people¬† now are being failed by society. My friend is young. She has lived and sees what's going on now....or not going on in the MH system. I work in mental health and do best with BPD people.
The mental health system is stuffed. It has no answers for your feelings and the emotions you feel. And they are real feelings. The drs and staff with the current systems don't have the time to sit and work through the issues. MBT, CBT,DBT can help but they don't focus on you as you need it. What you need is person centred . A mentor if you ever want the answer. 

I guess what I wanted to say is don't give up on yourself. It's not your fault.

7,Which therapy for BPD with conscious self sabotage?,"Hi, I'm really sorry this is so insanely long, I've been unironically re-editing it for 2 hours üíÄ even with chatgpt and stuff, I'm finding it hard to express myself, the original text was twice as long :/ I'm self aware of how childish and kind of narcissistic I sound as a person.

So I have BPD and probably ADHD, and I was thrown out of DBT (and another time I left myself, even though I had sacrificed a lot to get that spot) because they said I need more intensive (individual) therapy due to my lack of motivation. Basically only 40% of me wants to get better, and at least 60% actively and consciously wants to get worse, because of many reasons. It's been like this genuinely my entire life. It's a love-hate relationship, but tbh my disorder is all I have, I love it, and I don't really regret any of the things it's caused. Even though I'm miserable. I go in circles: I pretend to myself I want to go forward, but subconsciously I know I always go one step forward, two steps back, because I really just want the freedom of never having to commit to either hell or heaven, but always allowed to oscillate between the extremes, enjoy both of them, never truly change anything. Few days ago I read the term ""approach-avoidance repetition compulsion"", and it struck a cord with me. With everything.

Ofc I don't JUST struggle with conscious self-sabotage and emotional masochism, I have the full range of BPD symptoms, but it's a barrier to even working on them. I'm not sure how DBT can truly help me if I'm not even sure if I like happiness, or health, or responsibility, or in fact lean towards a no.

Recently I've want to know about psychodynamic therapy. I used to dismiss this as ""fake Freud mumbo jumbo,"" but recently I'm not sure. I feel like I need something that's less surface level than DBT... There are aspects of my psyche and childhood that genuinely puzzle me, and maybe understanding and processing them is essential before I can move on. I don't think so, but people often suggest there's repressed childhood trauma; obviously DBT couldn't care less. Subjectively I feel like a not crazy severe, but complex case, with a weirdly convoluted inner life. Maybe it's my annoying personality, but I always feel subtly broken in intricate ways that me and others barely understand, which must be impossible to untangle... :/

So, my question is, can psychodynamic therapy help me with this? Or is motivation a strict prerequisite there too? People say ""I can't help you if you don't want to get better"", but I don't know what they want from me. I can't change what I want and believe and feel on a deep level. And some part of me does want change. Would any sort of TFP, MBT,  or idk, ST or whatever, be able to help me WANT to change in the first place when I'm deeply resistent to change and very comfortable being sick? Or am I just doomed, or need to go down a darker path before I can get better? I'm not really sure who the therapies are for, or which presentations they help most

TL;DR: got kicked out of dbt and need to know which kind of psychodynamic therapy can help me with my lack of motivation + desire to get worse + fascination with misery and darkness. If any can.",1695619885.0,False,3,0,Philosophyofpizza,None,16rjiel,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/16rjiel/which_therapy_for_bpd_with_conscious_self_sabotage/
8,"Panic, anxiety and frequently ill","Hi, I'm very unsure how to phrase this because there's a lot, i don't even know what I'm seeking anymore and our mental health system is quite frankly awful.
First of all there's a lot of childhood trauma, partly due to what we think is undiagnosed ADHD and sensory issues. In all that has lead to me having multiple diagnoses including a personality disorder and autism. 

In 2021 i started being ill frequently, i think the average was every to months or so with cold symptoms or worse. This year it's a little less as far as i can remember, but my psychological symptoms skyrocketed

After the Russian invasion of Ukraine i started getting frequent panic attacks and long depressive episodes. I think this is partly because half my family is russians living in russia and both my mum and I had friends living in ukraine who had to flee. I guess this is because i saw a lot of russian nationalism, anti russian sentiment (bulking all russians into the russian nationalism group as well as a russian speaking latvian being beaten up), seeing war photos of murdered ukrainians, bombed villages and suffering popping up on my feeds (i understand the necessity to show the reality of what's happening tho) and the realisation that i would most likely never be able to see my family again as long as the current regime runs. 

This has led to multiple panic attacks especially if I'm alone, meaning I've had to move back to my parents. I also have had multiple crises, landed in the psychiatric ER who sent me to the psychiatric center who gave me an urgent spot in a day group which is over now and I'm standing without therapy again. I suspect they don't want me because I'm in line for an adhd assessment (due to strong indications and a high amount of childhood symptoms i can show to in both school documents and trough references) 

So i guess, i don't even know what to do anymore or what i want from this post. I try to eat healthily, stay away from alcohol as it's a trigger as well, try to work out and get fresh air, i try to be social, i am currently on vacation, i use hobbies and projects to keep me busy, i try to sleep as well as possible despite sleep issues from birth, I'm looking forwards to start university and adhd assessment, use cbt and mbt tools i've learned. I'm also aiming to join politics again once I'm a little better as it's a nice social arena and stimulating. I just don't know what to do with my mental health anymore",1660124359.0,False,2,2,Negative_Presence_90,None,wkt4lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/wkt4lc/panic_anxiety_and_frequently_ill/
9,I'm so indecisive. I don't know how to fix it or why I am this way.,"Hi all. I'm basically really indecisive. It's only really a problem when it comes to my friendships because i'll ask someone if they want to hang out and then regret it straight away and be super stressed about it. Then if they say yes, i'll change my mind. I'll just constantly be changing my mind when it comes to meeting up with friends. In the past, friends have expressed annoyance but that's about it. They've never had a serious talk with me. I wouldn't be friends with me tbh.  Actually it's not just my friendships because my sister also refuses to go out with me because i change my mind a lot. What the fuck is this man? I hate it. I don't know if i make sense. I have a diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable PD (principal), Anxiety and Depression.

10,*title... yes that.,"where do i even start? well if you are reading this i appreciate it, if you last the whole post then hats off to you.
I am a horrible person, toxic and self absorbed. I have depression, anxiety and.. i don't like this bit.. bpd. 
I always think im under attack or people are against me, i feel like as soon as something is not going well with someone then they must hate me, i mean in my head i do not see why they wouldnt. 
I cause arguments between me and my girlfriend because i get so defensive and again, feel like im under attack if theres even a hint of criticism. I dont let things go, i drag things out when they dont need to still be talked about. i create tension because i go silent, i go silent because in my head theres so many things rushing round. i almost become paralysed and freeze instead of just sorting things out. I think its pushing my gf away and i know its at least a huge drain on us. we are long distance too so it only adds to the stress. my thoughts become so irrational and when ive calmed down and thinking properly i can see how ridiculous i am being. im paranoid, i feel like people stare, i feel like they judge(i know everyone does to some degree but i mean like, really judge) and i feel like i dont deserve anything less. i dont blame people for thinking what they do, im sure i would if i saw me.. im a drain on everyone i know, burden is a good word but an understatement.
i havent properly self harmed in about 4-5months and its getting really really really really hard to not give in to urges. i find myself  fantasising about it often throughout the day and its often extreme. most of the day, everyday the urges are eating away at me. i have a hard time trying to fight it. soon i will be starting an 18month MBT course through the personality disorder service in my area, before i begun i was told i need to work on reducing my selfharm. i was self harming a lot and for ties it would be daily but i have, like i said, stopped anything i would consider self harm, im scared im going to ruin my chances on this course if i cant keep urges at bay. 
I am in recovery from an eating disorder too. this is becoming/has become an increasing issue too. i want to go with those thoughts, i want to go with the unhealthy ED behaviors so desperately but i know this cant happen. i mean it can, i know it can but for my own sake, for my gf's sake i cant let it takeover. im being torn in two completely different directions. one is safe and one is selfish. i feel torn, i cry about it and i feel so much hatred for my body, for what i put in it, for what i see all this eating is doing to me. this isnt about being thin, this is about so much more, i dont know if i want to go into that right now. i dont even know if explining would be of any use... 
I hate me. I hate how i look. I hate my face. I hate that my scars have faded so much. I hate how my head works. I FUCKING HATE ME.
i dont feel like me. or i do but i feel like in my head is not the person i am. i feel like im sat way way back watching from the back of the room while my body is what is seen. i stare at myself in the mirror and i dont feel like that thing looking back, i mean its me but i dont really feel like it is. the person looking back is an imposter? maybe they are but no one knows and or would ever believe that. then i remember, ive never fitted in, its not about to suddenly feel like i do and that the face people see is what i deserve to have to deal with.. but  hate hate hate it. 

this post is more of a venting/ranting post i guess and it probably doesnt make too much sense. I not sure what i hope to gain by this. 
if you made it to the end, give yourself a pat on the back and thank you for reading.",1521240589.0,False,2,3,Krychex,None,84zjz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/84zjz0/title_yes_that/
