Do not send your daughter to an RTC- that will very likely traumatize (or re-traumatize) her and may put her in physical danger (Rip Taylor Goodridge and all the others we‚Äôve lost). I would also recommend against PHP‚Äôs, but they‚Äôre a much better option than RTCs due to having more legal oversight (but don‚Äôt get it twisted: PHPs have their issues as well). 

Why I wouldn‚Äôt do a PHP) Removing your child from their home environment for ‚Äútreatment‚Äù only teaches them how to survive in their new environment- not at home. Most of the time, the ‚Äúprogress‚Äù seen in residential centers does not carry back home- and this outcome doesn‚Äôt improve with longer residential stays‚Ä¶ ie no matter when you bring your kid back, she‚Äôs going to relapse/backslide. This is multiplied by the trauma experienced by your child in these facilities, and can result in even more severe mental health struggles upon return. Companies under the troubled teen industry know this, and use this fact to manipulate you into giving them more money. They know that your kid is going to relapse no matter how long you keep her in there‚Ä¶ and they know they can just blame you for her relapse if you chose to bring her home ‚Äúearly‚Äù. These programs and the ‚Äútreatments‚Äù they use have no scientific backing. Do not trust their sweet words- they will say anything to get your money.

If you want more information, I highly recommend the podcasts ‚ÄúGooned‚Äù by Emma Lehman and ‚ÄúBroken Promises‚Äù by Marlee Porter. You can also look into ‚ÄúUnsilenced‚Äù- a nonprofit organization advocating against institutional child abuse.

0,"It's completely normal to feel apprehensive and anxious about starting a new treatment program, especially something as intensive as a Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP). It's a big step towards healing, and it's okay to have doubts and fears about what's to come. The fact that you recognize your need for help and have taken steps to enroll in a PHP shows a great deal of courage and willingness to work towards your mental wellness.

Feeling uncertain about your readiness for help or questioning your worthiness of the investment in your own recovery is not uncommon. Remember, your journey to wellness is unique to you, and it's not about meeting certain standards or timelines but about making progress in a way that's meaningful and beneficial to you. The staff in the program are there to support you, and their perception of progress is meant to be a guide, not a judgment. It's important to communicate openly with them about your goals, fears, and what progress means to you.

Facing financial pressures while seeking treatment adds another layer of stress, but prioritizing your mental health is crucial. It's the foundation upon which you can rebuild your life, including your education and career. Try to focus on the present and the support the program offers, rather than the pressure to rush through it.

You are worth the time and energy it takes to heal. It's okay to be scared, and it's okay to have doubts, but try to hold onto the hope that this program is a step forward. You've made a brave choice by deciding to pursue mental wellness. Allow yourself to be open to the help and support available to you, and remember that recovery is a journey, not a race. Your well-being is the most valuable investment you can make.",Drmind_1990,1akxqlp

0,"Both Celery and Pasta deserve support, but I also agree with you that singling out other patients because of details in their share can be harmful. Triggering topics do come up in group therapy, but I still disagree with the therapist not moderating this conversation more effectively on the whole. 

I think you did the right thing by reassuring Celery. These are difficult topics to discuss, even more so in a group setting. I hope everybody in this situation is able to find their own peace and regulation concerning the topic.",imaginedsymbolism333,14nb8vm
1,"That is the downside to group therapy, members can sometimes say something that is negative to another person. I'm really surprised that your group therapist did not say something to intervene.

2,"I 100% plan to on Monday, I just don't want to do it in front of Pasta. I might write a note and give it to her, or pull her aside. To be fair to the group leader, we were running behind. I just really hope Celery doesn't backslide over this, he was already feeling fragile. And I know it's not my concern if he does, but I think it's normal to not want someone else to be hurting. I do feel guilty because my first thought was ""You don't self-harm, so why tf are you making this about you?""",Theaterismylyfe,14nb8vm

0,"A few things you may want to consider when weighing your PHP options:
1) Do you have relatives/friends you can stay with or enough savings to cover travel and living expenses where you‚Äôll be going for treatment? Most PHPs are treatment only and do not provide housing and meals.
2) Will time off work/away from home be an issue? PHPs can run 3-6 months or longer depending on your diagnosis and treatment plan.
3) Does your insurance cover the PHP cost out of state? If you‚Äôre currently in treatment your psychologist/psychiatrist can help with the PHP referral.

I‚Äôm glad that you‚Äôre deciding to seek treatment. Keep in mind that it‚Äôs already mentally and physically demanding in itself. Treatment will go smoother if you can focus your energy into the program and not have additional issues to worry about. Best wishes.",DontBrainMyDamage,15ycjc1

1,"Baptist Health in Jacksonville (about 4 hours away). I was a patient (suicidal, major depression, anxiety) in their inpatient program there for a week and it was lovely. Very clean facility, very caring and intelligent staff. I actually went to nursing school (specializing in mental healthcare) because of the providers and patients I met there. People struggling with addiction generally go to other facilities in the city, and most of the people I met as a patient were struggling with anxiety or depression due to traumatic life events. I‚Äôm not sure if anything has changed since I went, but you always have activities and therapy sessions to go to, and you can spend time outside doing yoga as well. There are a variety of staff members, from RNs to art therapists to neurologists and clinical psychologists.

She has had doctors refuse to give her referrals because they don't think she has a problem. I think part of her service issues are because England seems to... not really give a shit about the north, from what I understand.

1,"I can't answer your question but I can tell you about a variety of self-help methods shown to be useful for PTSD and derealization. 

Therapists often recommend self-help to go with their therapy.  
  
If you go to the Amazon ad for The PTSD Sourcebook by Dr. Glenn Schiraldi, you'll see from the reader reviews that people with the disorder really appreciate this book, which says that there's a variety of symptoms associated with PTSD, some of which respond to self-help. For example, there's a simple but effective remedy for recurrent nightmares.   
  
A psychologist named James Pennebaker has written a book on journaling as a treatment for trauma victims, Expressive Writing: Words That Heal. It's based on his clinical research.   
  
A study at Stanford (video, below) in which war veterans - some of whom had not been helped by other treatments - experienced anxiety brought down to normal levels after one week of slow breathing therapy, and good results a year later.  
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvli7NBUfY4&t=3s  
  
The Psychology Today derealization article mentions grounding exercises, which brings up the interesting topic of mindfulness meditation. Some people say that they've had very good results with mindfulness for derealization but others say their results were disappointing.  
  
  
I'll give you some examples of grounding exercises.  
  
  
Eat a handful of raisins or nuts very slowly, appreciating every piece, taking a long time to finish them, being aware of your slow breathing.  
  
  
Wash and dry the dishes very carefully, focusing on what you're doing, the feelings in your hands and the sound of the water.  
  
  
Examine objects. Pick up a  few objects, name them, feel them and carefully inspect them.  
  
  
Count things.  
  
  
Breathing slowly through your nose, be aware of bodily sensations - the air passing through your nostrils, the feeling of your clothing on your skin, the pressure of the floor on the soles of your feet. Look around at the room, aware of the present moment, the here and now.  
  
  
You can't go wrong with stress management. It's something we all need and it can help with anxiety and depression, especially when combined with the standard treatments. This has a lot of info -

https://power2u.org/directory-of-peer-respites/


A peer respite is a voluntary, short-term, overnight program that provides community-based, non-clinical crisis support to help people find new understanding and ways to move forward. It operates 24 hours per day in a homelike environment. 


Peer respites were designed as psychiatric hospital diversion programs to support individuals experiencing or at-risk of a psychiatric crisis. The premise behind peer respites is that psychiatric emergency services can be avoided if less coercive or intrusive supports are available in the community.


Peer respites engage guests in mutual, trusting relationships with peer staff. Peer support involves a process of mutual helping based on the principles of respect and shared responsibility. Peer support includes interactions in which individuals help themselves and others through fostering relationships and engaging in advocacy to empower people to participate in their communities.


Peer respites are staffed and operated by people with psychiatric histories or who have experienced trauma and/or extreme states. This means that 100% of staff have lived experience of extreme states and/or the behavioral health system.",GreetTheIdesOfMarch,1aq8cym

https://www.mcleanhospital.org/treatment/pavilion

I am 41f, and I did this program last year‚Äî it was very good. The only difficult part is the cost. It is about $62,000 for the 14 day program, and since the Pavilion is a self-pay program, they do not accept insurance or directly assist with insurance reimbursement.

I was fortunate enough to have family with the resources to help me go, and it was excellent. Even if you don‚Äôt have the money, it‚Äôs worth reading about the program on the website, just to get an idea of what‚Äôs out there. I had no idea that there were ‚Äúresidential‚Äù programs like this one that were not inpatient. I could keep my phone, computer, all my clothes‚Äîthe only thing that was controlled was the nurse handled everyone‚Äôs meds.

It was a resounding NO. I get the argument, you're activating pleasurable receptors in your brain. When you leave they give you this big list of medications (over and behind the counter) that we shouldn't take because it could stimulate the receptors and cause cravings/relapse. Many of those meds have way way less pleasurable aspects than nicotine. I'm trying to think of a good example but all I can think of is over the counter sleep meds but there's better examples. 

I think this change is due to marijuana becoming more and more legal. I know I really pushed the question ""why can't I use weed if people can use nicotine & caffeine? It's even less toxic"" and I never got a good answer and was allowed to use weed during IOP.",SoggyHotdish,1aq8cym

I‚Äôve done so much research on derealisation and depersonalisation and the main point that a lot of people speak of is ‚Äúacceptance‚Äù.

Or still might do. You're aware of it which is what rules it out of being a psychosis yes. But you're in denial of its severity and possible progression. Professionals have given you warning you need help, that's what they trained to do. It's better to learn the skills that'll be offered now before it possibly does worsen.

If I relied on my family history it would look like my dad developed BPD out of nowhere.
I'd have developed so many diagnoses out of nowhere with no possibility of getting based on history. because its only genetic or triggered by brain damage (which i do not have). Some of which turned round and made me see symptoms I was missing, and exactly which family member needed a visit too. My grandma was diagnosed with anxiety after years of insomnia only because I finally found a GP who said ""I don't think it's your insomnia as a root issue, I think it's your anxiety"" and I told her about my own visit.

Idk how much time you've spent researching cause of mental illnesses or who all you've spoken to. I've spent 10yrs doing so daily. Because no family history so how could this have possibly popped up without trauma related to it that i may not have acknowledged as trauma?
I don't see why you need to fight about this at all, you asked for advice and opinions on going to treatment. I gave you that opinion and then you started to argue about cannabis being the cause instead because you didn't like that part of mine. I'm sorry we see different research, but with cannabis it's underesearched and as someone who has spoken to doctors for and against it and had my medical marijuana licensing for years (meaning I have had doctors and NPs who specialized in medical cannabis to give me my facts) I know all the research is biased or not done in control set ups on both points of view.
As a teen I was convinced my mental health problems were a direct relation and caused by cannabis use. Until I quit for 2 yrs and things got significantly worse. It wasn't until a doctor took a real good look at my history and suggested cannabis wasn't the cause but over consumption of it may have been what triggered  something.

I never said it wasn't a possibility your brain wouldn't manage coping, I also said there are other things in life that could trigger it too.
These issues are never not going on through the entirety of everyones life and everyones degree of severity is different. Some brains just manage to cope better than others.

You didn't form those initial connections due to weed, you merely opened them or worsened them.
The older I get the more little silly things and even one time events I look back on I see patterns that were so spread apart and just went unnoticed that if they'd grouped together and been recognized my diagnoses could've come before the breakdowns. It's really hard to appropriately assess family or even individual history to determine these things that don't show up on lab tests. There's so much that's easily missed or pushed off because there is such a broad range of symptoms and the similarities in cases can only ever be generalized. 
Yes that is exactly what's happening. As I've tried to say. This is the concern of your professional and why they suggested this treatment, you have progression despite stopping consumption. You are at a critical life stage being in uni, I think you underestimate how easily stress can cause another break for you. Your professional can see a note signs you won't. And they won't always tell you what they are, especially if you're iffy about accepting help offered.

I‚Äôm also wondering if they‚Äôre biased in favor of recommending more intensive treatment to make the facility more money. I‚Äôm not sure.

You hit the nail on the head. At least in the US, it's either you're on the brink of death by suicide or you don't get more comprehensive services. 

I know you said that there isn't much in the way of partial hospitalization near you - I'm not sure if you've also looked up intensive outpatient, but the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Sometimes, one's more intensive than the other but in my experience, they're similar. 

Also, depending on your daughter's specific struggles (I know you said ADHD, anxiety, and depression but I'm referring more to symptoms), she may be able to get into a program like DBT or CBT. DBT helps people with interpersonal effectiveness (friends and family issues), impulsivity (from self harm and suicide to impulsive spending and decisions), mindfulness/""middle of the road"" approaches, and emotional regulation. It was designed primarily for people with borderline personality disorder, but many programs don't require you to have that diagnosis to participate.

This program mentions suicidality and self-harm, but it doesn't appear to be a requirement:  [https://www.mcleanhospital.org/treatment/3east](https://www.mcleanhospital.org/treatment/3east) . Not sure if any of this helps, but figured I'd throw it out there!",brielzibub,f62q8p

Both are more similar to what it's like in an adolescent hospital setting, and might offer what you're looking for. Personally, I would also recommend a psychiatrist just to look at more treatment options. I understand that your daughter is young and medications can take a heavy toll, but there are smaller doses with supplements that can really help to improve someone's ability to overcome that cloud of depression even for a moment or work to think rationally through anxiety.

Once when I was complaining to a social worker she snapped back with, ""Well you should be happy, we have one of the best mental health system and resources for kids in the country!""  While I am thankful of that, I also realize that even our great system we have where I live still sucks and could be far better.  

&#x200B;

I hope you are able to get her some more help.  I know the terrible feeling of wanting to help your child and the system is working against you and you can't get the help you need.  She has been sent home when she checked herself in for having suicidal thoughts and because they were full and busy and because she lied and said she could keep herself safe they let her go home.  Less than 24 hours later she was in the ER and they magically were able to find a bed for her after she followed through on her attempt.  

&#x200B;

We've spent days in the Children's hospital with a nurse sitting in the room 24/7 while we waited for a hospital bed to open up at a psychiatric hospital.  We've gone through so many therapist.  The best thing we ever had was at one point when my daughter was younger and I was a single parent, we were able to get her into a therapy program where the therapist actually came to our house weekly.  Some weeks she would pick my daughter up from school and they would just do her therapy sessions from the car or at a park and sometimes she would come to the house and they would sit inside or if the weather was nice go outside.  That was a game changer for us for sure.  

&#x200B;

I know it most likely won't be covered by insurance but so many places will do online/video therapy now is that an option you could look into?  For awhile all of my daughters Psych appointments were telepsych and we did video chats with all of her psychiatrist.  I know there are therapist and therapy programs out there, you hopefully could find one geared towards kids your daughters age and maybe go that route?

I'd recommend getting your child on the waiting list for the partial program. In the meantime, call your insurance provider at the number on the back of your card (sometimes the behavioral health provider is separate from your regular healthcare provider) and ask for recommendations for in network providers  with current openings. A lot of times your behavioral health insurance provider can help funnel you to a provider with availabilitynext- they don't want you to be  waiting without treatment. Additionally, outpatient therapists can see kids twice weekly -if clinically indicated, so this is an option. You could also ask the school or look on your towns Facebook group to see if there are any group therapies or other supports being offered in your area. Best of luck to you, it's definitely not easy to navigate and I fully agree the system  is very flawed - but there ARE amazing, qualified people out there that want to help you and your little girl.

I‚Äôve had to go through circles to get info and the system is flawed, period.

I know my sister started having problems when she was 8. The options were a psych ward (that's what they call it at the facilities - ""psychiatric ward within so and so hospital""), group homes, and once-weekly therapy. I got into a group when I was 12 because the clinic decided I was ""mature"" enough.

There was also the issue of doctors pointing the blame at my parents for having 3 mentally ill children in elementary school. There WAS abuse, but because we knew that we wouldn't have a say in what happened to us when we were that young, we just didn't seek help. Must be even scarier for kids whose parents aren't abusing them who have to deal with questioning.",brielzibub,f62q8p

Different therapies work for different people. I benefited from a dual DBT/CBT program when both of my sisters didn't at all. I didn't benefit from meditation when most people I know did.

It has to have some success with enough people to be included in programs.",brielzibub,f62q8p
65,"No problem! I'm not entirely sure what a partial hospitalization program looks like, which might be because I'm in a different part of the U. S. IOP for me was going to the hospital where I had previously been in a residential program twice a week or more for group therapy with the same staff, and with more knowledge about my specific situation. IOP was more rigorous for me than a normal group because of the focus on my specific problems while also working with the group.",siestakitten,f62q8p
66,"You are very welcome.  I will never forget the first time my daughter was hospitalized and walking out of the hospital alone without her, I have never felt so completely alone and isolated in my life.  They didn't tell me what I was supposed to do, I didn't know how to process anything that had just happened and it was a very emotional and scary time.  Anytime after when I would walk in or out and I would see other parents in the same place, I would just get so emotional, it just breaks my heart.  Thankfully now the mental hospitals around here now offer family and friend support groups.  

I am located in Michigan.  Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions or even if you just need to vent or a shoulder to lean on.  It's a long hard road and can feel very isolating.

Im glad you are working with a navigator and they are escalating it for you. You may be well treated in a twice weekly outpatient setting - only time will tell. Accessible mental health treatment (or lack thereof) is an epidemic in this country , no debate there. Boston area definitely has better options than most. Start with OP (when they get the right referral in place) and hopefully that will be an appropriate level of support. Depending on your insurance, there are sometimes other options like in home behavioral treatment where a therapist can do more than one hour sessions and offer more family focused and behavioral interventions multiple times per week.",beekay6,f62q8p

74,"Medication management is important for ADHD. Also. when I say life skills, I just mean like emotional development and stuff. It may encompass executive functioning as you said. Therapy is great for that, but if you are having trouble finding programs, I‚Äôm just offering alternative suggestions that as a person with ADHD I can tell you might help. I am thinking that there are so many other aspects to ADHD that any sort of class like that would be helpful. Even if she got involved in a club or something... I mean, I know it doesn‚Äôt seem realistic, but the idea is to get her involved in something she enjoys. It will help build a sense of confidence in herself. What does she hyper focus on? For me, that was science and math. 

Also, to make it clear what my credentials are, I‚Äôve experienced a lot first hand. I have had undiagnosed ADHD, my parents died at a young age (6) and then was abused later on leading to C-PTSD accompanied by GAD and atypical depression with occasional major depressive episodes. I have had many mental health issues, and I am recovering very well. 

I am kind of frustrated because if you agree with below, that your child is 4 years behind in development because of ADHD, I don‚Äôt know if you understand what ADHD is or the implications of it. To make what I mean clearer, I will tell you about my sister who also has ADHD. She didn‚Äôt talk until 4 and was below average until she got the help she needed and now is doing very well in school. I was in the top 10 in high school. My sister and I have our struggles socially, but we‚Äôre fine. We‚Äôre not behind, we‚Äôre just different. I know several people with ADHD in physics graduate school, many not medicated, who are doing very well. Please clarify what you mean because ADHD does not render me behind my peers.

Also, this discussion may anger you - I am pretty blunt and coarse - but I come from a place with good intentions. I wouldn‚Äôt sit here and talk about this with you if I wasn‚Äôt trying to help. It‚Äôs not my problem, and you also didn‚Äôt really ask, but having been in your daughters shoes, I want to help. That‚Äôs how I got better; people offered what they could. I hope you are open to this. But, if you don‚Äôt want my feedback, that‚Äôs understandable. Nonetheless, feel free to PM me.",CompetitiveJaguar3,f62q8p

There is a lot of misinformation that people believe surrounding ADHD and the stigmas. There are a lot of professionals out there that think they know it all, when they know next to nothing about the advances in technology and the changes within the research on ADHD.

Originally it was thought 2-4 years, now it appears to have been averaged at 4 years. Not to say that that can't change, as Neurology takes over the diagnosis side of things in the future.

I am a scientist, so watching the world believe a lot of stigmas and old knowledge is a serious issue among all things. I hope you are willing to educate me and send me articles and studies that would be beneficial to me. I would really appreciate it!

Nonetheless, this misinformation/stigma/old knowledge is partly why I went undiagnosed for so long. I wasn‚Äôt excessively disruptive in the classroom, and I did well in school. Also, in reference to your ‚Äúcorrelation doesn‚Äôt equal causation‚Äù. The meaning that I interpret from this - and correct me if I‚Äôm wrong - is that I have ADHD and I have been assuming my experiences are caused by ADHD, but this is incorrect, they are just coincidentally correlated. However, I would argue that my experience is caused by ADHD. It is definitely influenced by outside factors, I totally understand that. But I have good reason to believe that it is. 

Furthermore, I know I am certainly not an expert in ADHD. I am studying chemistry, and I am no chemical expert. But, I am in expert in my individual experience, that I believe is caused by ADHD. Until I get sent the studies, I am still maintaining my experience as a counter example of developmental delay. I also will admit I don‚Äôt understand what exactly is meant by developmental delay... even saying the brain fully matures later is still confusing to me. I don‚Äôt know how they would identify ADHD as the defining factor in developmental delay, and how that expressed in everyday life. Again, I would use myself as a counter example.

I think so far I have been only citing my experience, which I believe is caused by ADHD, so I believe my suggestion of certain classes and medication management is still a beneficial suggestion.

TL;DR: I am not an expert in ADHD, but my experience that I believe is caused by ADHD serves as an example for how ADHD can affect people. I would like to be educated with links to specific studies for claims.",CompetitiveJaguar3,f62q8p

The treatment field has become an ‚Äúindustry.‚Äù It‚Äôs rapidly been growing over the last eight years and getting worse and worse when it comes to unethical, illegal, fraudulent all the way to fatal for clients/patients.

There‚Äôs multiple practices that are being done from the second you click search on Google to the first phone call you make, the person you‚Äôre speaking to just reading a script sitting in a call center and telling you whatever it takes for you to put your child in his facility, so he fills a bed and collects a huge commission. And none of them care about whether their program is the right fit for your child. 

There‚Äôs offering to purchase a potential client‚Äôs first month of insurance, even paying for a flight out to wherever they‚Äôre located. It‚Äôs all absolutely illegal, inducements and kickbacks, illegal yet it‚Äôs still happening. There‚Äôs no regulation and endless amounts of money to be made.

0,"My situation is a little different, but I hope it helps just hearing what I did. I took some time off of school after going through a really terrible period of mental health issues. I had an abusive sibling and when that situation got to its worst I fell apart. Even when he was removed from my home and legally kept away, I seriously struggled with being in college at that time. School has always been so important to me, and my parents expect a lot from me, so it was such a hard choice. I spent a while just working like twice a week and doing therapy. I think having a lot of time at home was both helpful and harmful. Mentally, it hurt me a lot to see myself not being able to function how I did before my PTSD induced breakdown. But on the other hand, I really needed space to heal, while not being triggered by everything that was expected of me. It was the first time I didn‚Äôt feel like I absolutely needed to be doing 15 things at once and like I was always ‚Äúbehind‚Äù on everything. After a while, I started working more, and that helped a lot. I‚Äôve always been someone who‚Äôs strives with routine and staying busy. I thought a lot about what I wanted to do during that time, and leaned into that (biomed research). I started saving money, having less emotional outbursts, doing better socially. Then I applied back to school, and used the same sort of methods. I kept myself SO BUSY with work and classes/labs. Then I applied to an internship (ended up getting hired instead) and it really turned my life around. I was so filled with passion for the research I was doing and so focused on projects.

2,"So I‚Äôm a veteran dealing with major depression disorder, ptsd, suicidal ideation/attempts. I‚Äôm currently in what appears to be a similar program to what you describe at my local VA known as RRTP. Generally the program can last 45-60 days but can be extended up to 90 if requested or recommended. The particular program I‚Äôm in is also geared to helping people struggling with addiction problems though the curriculum itself is designed in a way that it provides tools and knowledge that assist with depression,ptsd etc.

A good portion of what is being taught are skills that can be used to help us identify when we are spiraling out in various ways. Additionally the program helps us with learning to avoid and work thru our issues when they pop up. There‚Äôs a lot of different methods to doing these things and some work better than others depending on the person. The key to success though is finding which of these skills works for us and actually practicing them to the point where they become reflexive when needed similar to how within the military they drill you until the drill becomes essentially muscle memory. Some people pick up these skills quicker than others and either way it‚Äôs necessary to become well practiced before you leave to ensure your success.

Personally I extended my stay til the 90 day marker because I want to really wrap my head around the techniques being taught. 

Addendum. I highly doubt they extended her to ‚Äúget more money‚Äú these types of programs have waitlists of 2+ months to get into and and usually filled up as much as Covid restrictions will allow. In fact In order for me to extend I had to write a paper stating why I wanted to stay and what skills I wanted to focus on then had to have all the staff psychologists approve my extension.",,x8dlg6

1,"I hear a lot of mental health specialists don‚Äôt find diagnosing personality disorders, especially bpd, helpful. Bpd is a ptsd or cptsd response, so many psychologists or psychiatrists will treat the symptoms of bpd / ptsd but not diagnose it as such, as bpd is a diagnosis that comes with a lot of stigma and often hurts a patient more than it helps them. Employers can sometimes require access to medical records and a diagnosis can affect your chance of employment (fucked up i know but it‚Äôs true). 

This is what i‚Äôve heard from several specialists. I‚Äôve even heard a psychologist say they will not treat bpd patients at all, so the stigma can definitely be hurtful. Just an idea of why yours might not have diagnosed you.",Mundane-Cost4076,vmr9er
2,"I see two sides of the coin here - on the one hand, you should be careful with self diagnosis because 1) you are not a trained psychologist, psychiatrist, psychotherapist, and 2) even if you were, it's very difficult to be objective about yourself so you probably would still need to go to someone else.

On the other hand though are a few counter points. First, psychiatry is not the same as psychology and as you said, your psychiatrist didn't spend more than a total of what, 30 minutes with you and in that limited time, did not even ask you about your history, relationships etc that would be necessary to make a diagnosis. Second, you also need to trust your intuition. I'm not saying disregard the experts but ultimately we are the ones with the best knowledge of ourselves and if something doesn't feel right to you, at the very least you should discuss it further!

Also, the fact that they made an assessment after so few sessions with you is also odd. My psych and I have discussed diagnosis at length and it's only now that we've been working together for many months that we are going ahead with it. This is in line with what several of my friends say on the matter as well - these people are both pursuing postgraduate degrees in psychology.

So I would say you are valid in your concern about the speed of the diagnosis. Whether you actually do have BPD I couldn't say but just from how you explained the psychiatrist ruling it out, it seems like they didn't have enough info to make a call like that.

So I would say you should discuss it with them further. It doesn't need to be a confrontational thing at all and I don't think you should be afraid of retaliation! This is your life and a misdiagnosis could definitely affect that you have every right to discuss it further and if they DO retaliate, IMHO that would be extremely unprofessional and if my psych did that to me I would not be comfortable working with them further.

I would just be direct and say, you would like to know what their reasoning is behind striking BPD off the list as you feel very strongly that you have a lot of the BPD symptoms. Ask them how they can be sure you don't have it when you haven't worked together for very long at all?

There is best practice in any field, and there is in psychology on how to diagnose someone and just because you don't have a degree in it doesn't mean you can't look at that best practice and make a judgement call on it.",_fyre_ball_,vmr9er

9,"UK-based. I have a partner with bipolar and GAD, along with a paper diagnosis of ‚ÄúEUPD (new term here for BPD) traits‚Äù. The former was given several years earlier after months and months of close interactions with a mix of in/out-patient therapy, the latter was given much later by a psychiatrist after a couple of short appointments - you can guess which one caused no end of crap when it came to any other health professionals and getting the correct treatment. It took a long time for the new team to stop treating my partner as an EUPD sufferer and engage with a ‚Äúbipolar first‚Äù approach.
In the end we asked what those ‚Äútraits‚Äù were, with the reply being ‚Äúself-harm‚Äù and ‚Äúself-loathing‚Äù, which you could probably link to just about any bloody mental health issue.
My partner‚Äôs good friend with a long-standing bipolar diagnosis was in hospital for a long time recently and upon leaving was given the same ‚ÄúEUPD traits‚Äù diagnosis as my partner, which messed up their care plan.

The truth is the professionals aren‚Äôt infallible and don‚Äôt know everything, as much as we all wish they did. There is a lot to be said for time spent and your own intuition. Incorrect diagnoses are a thing and happen plenty in mental health.

Do your research on both, ask why they have given you this diagnosis, present clear reasoning for why you think the way you do. You are a part of your own treatment and have the power to take part. Don‚Äôt ever hesitate to bring something up, unanswered questions serve you no purpose.

Maybe they‚Äôre reading something about you that you can‚Äôt see, but you have the right to know. An incorrect diagnosis can lead to incorrect treatment and feeling like you‚Äôre just not being listened to in your vulnerable state. On the flip side, a correct diagnosis is the speediest path to finding the right help.

Having said that, not matter what anyone says, EUPD has a stigma among health professionals. It‚Äôs like they skip over everything else and use it as a reason to not take you seriously, as a sufferer is prone to extreme and unpredictable swings of mood and poor decision-making, meaning their first instinct can be to delay any help and ‚Äúwait for it to blow over‚Äù.

My partner was admitted to an NHS hospital recently that had had a patient a couple of years ago with EUPD who had something like 27 admissions over 2 years. On the 28th, they discharged him while he was still saying he would kill himself (NHS wait lists for these beds are appalling, creating pressure for hospitals to free up beds), which he did that very afternoon.

With all this in mind, I still think a diagnosis of EUPD/BPD should be talked through with your psychiatrist and you should be ok with it if it is definitely the right one for you, because nothing can replace feeling understood.

If you find it difficult, find someone who knows you and that you trust and ask if you can talk it all through with them and have them attend your appointments with you, to bring up things you may forget on the spot and to help you feel supported. Bring notes of your questions too, as it‚Äôs easy to feel rushed.

Best of luck on your journey, and don‚Äôt stop fighting for your own side because you‚Äôre on a lifelong course and could end up interacting with many psychiatrists/psychologists along your way - the more you know yourself, the easier it is to navigate.

I have a suite of medical conditions that require specialists but I would throw every single one of them into a lake of fire before I would part ways with my psychiatrist.

13,"Something I try to keep in mind is that my anxiety, feelings of shame over my behavior, and frustration often lead me to view my mental health issues as more severe or intractable than they actually are. Another thing that happens to me is that I get frustrated and start trying to figure out ""what's really going on here"" by comparing my symptoms to various mental health issues, desperate for answers and relief.

Is it possible similar feelings are causing you to fixate on obtaining a specific diagnosis? If the answer is yes, it doesn't mean you should necessarily drop your theory altogether, but maybe it means you should be more open to other possibilities and not stress so much about it in general.

At any rate, I think if you approach your psychiatrist with your concerns in a civil (non-accusatory) manner, it's unlikely they will ""retaliate."" If you're still unsatisfied, there's no harm in going to another doctor and seeing what they say. I think a therapist will have more to say about the issues you described, and that you'll probably make the most progress by seeing both a psychiatrist and therapist in general.",chairmanm30w,vmr9er
14,"The first psychiatrist I saw I only had one meeting with and he gave me my diagnoses in that session. I was in the clinic for over a year, it's not that there wasn't time for more meetings, just that he didn't feel there was any need. 

Psychotherapists, broadly speaking, are more likely to want to avoid diagnoses altogether, so I am unsure what would be gained by bringing it up with them. 

I think that the fact that you recently lost your partner is unlikely to make them dismiss you in this way - but it might be having an influence, because if what to you classifies as the ""frantic attempts to avoid abandonment"" that we see in BPD is something that the psychiatrist judges to be within the range of normality, then that would indeed be a fairly strong indicator that BPD is highly unlikely. 

Also, if you used to behave in a way that was pretty toxic (and, for arguments sake, let's say that it was indeed typical BPD style behaviour) but no longer do, and as a result no longer meet the diagnostic criteria for BPD, then the psychiatrist is also right to not diagnose you with BPD, in part because you no longer meet the criteria, and in part because PDs generally require active work from the individual and from others (e.g. from therapists). That isn't to discount the work you have done, which is admirable, it's just that active work without professional intervention (and I suspect over a relatively short period of time?) actually being effective suggests that the problem it was dealing with was something other than a personality disorder. 

That being said, I have experienced psychiatrists who cannot be described as anything but incompetent who somehow make diagnoses without even asking the patient questions or really listening to them. I have no idea how they are even justifying the diagnoses they give to themselves, because while the general ways of existing of a person may give you a hint towards the type of disorder in some cases, they most certainly do not get you anywhere near a single diagnosis. The first psychiatrist I saw ruled out BPD (which I was eventually diagnosed with) ""because I'm a man"". It's more common in women, yes, but only like 80% of people with BPD are women...leaving more or less 20% who are men. So he was essentially a failure of a human being tbh

It might be the case that rather than having ruled out BPD in particular, that they have ruled out the possibility of it being a personality disorder altogether. This would likely be possible to do within the first meeting because all personality disorders have an additional common set of criteria which have to be fulfilled, the first of which is clinically significant disruption in 2 or more out of: cognition, affect, interpersonal relationships, and impulse control. So if you are only having major difficulties in 1 of those areas, then all personality disorders (and therefore BPD) would be ruled out",Quinlov,vmr9er

It‚Äôs not alarmist, it‚Äôs reassuring someone that it‚Äôs ok and reasonable to question if you aren‚Äôt convinced by a diagnosis, even just to have the psychiatrist provide reassurance.

No-one here is saying that OP should choose their own diagnosis, only that they should feel comfortable seeking more clarity by challenging the diagnosis given to them if they have valid points.",ALostParent,vmr9er

79,"OP has already been diagnosed with bipolar II, the issue is that they believe they also have BPD and their psychiatrist wrote the diagnosis off. OP having BPD will not change the medications that they would be prescribed (see the Mayo Clinic page from my prior post). Telling OP that their psychiatrist may be prescribing them wrong meds when that isn‚Äôt true is a great way to get OP to stop taking their meds, which can easily lead to disaster. BPD and bipolar have an infamous history of being comorbid and are treated with the exact medication.

I completely agree with every part of fyre_ball‚Äôs initial post, my issue is with their follow-up that stated a misdiagnosis may lead to a medication issue when BPD a) is not normally medicated for at all and b) if it is medicated for, will be medicated for with mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics, both of which are appropriate to treat bipolar disorder. Telling OP that a misdiagnosis may lead to wrong medication is straight-up wrong and may encourage OP to stop taking their meds, which could be a lethal decision.

OP‚Äôs problem needs to be discussed with their therapist. A psychiatrist diagnosing someone with a personality disorder after a few meetings is inappropriate, but the doc shouldn‚Äôt have eliminated the diagnosis either. OP shouldn‚Äôt drop the discussion, but they shouldn‚Äôt stop taking meds in the interim either.",biologytrash,vmr9er

Ask about the average size of groups and general structure to the day. Another good question would be what therapy types do they use. Some do art therapy, others focus on mindfulness, etc. Think about what your goals for completing a partial hospitalization are and find one that will fit with how you learn and interact with others.

Ask about the staff and patient size, frequency of 1:1 therapy, psychiatric access, insurance coverage (who they work with and how many days are covered), and other kinds of outpatient services (family therapy, full day/half day, referrals, other kinds of support after). 

Group therapy can be very cathartic, but quiet folks can get lost in the shuffle in a large group. Sharing can be hard when you are anxious or embarrassed. Individual therapy and access to a licensed psychiatrist for med changes is critical.

I found that pre-journaling was really helpful. We usually started with a check in that was always the same: how depressed are you (0-10), how anxious are you (0-10), goal for the day, do you need meds. I‚Äôd write down my answers before the sessions officially started so I wasn‚Äôt nervous about my answer when it came time to say something. If I ever got stuck, I‚Äôd go back to my treatment plan and pick a goal from the list of things to work on. 

When you write the list of questions for you phone calls, leave a lot of space for their answer on the piece of paper, so you know you have space and time to write. I try and take my time with notes. People are usually patient if you say ‚Äúthank you, give me a moment to write that down fully so I don‚Äôt have to remember it later.‚Äù Depression has turned my short term memory to absolute poop, so I can‚Äôt hold more than 2-3 things in active memory at a time.

1,"They said that they will happily help place me in a residential option for a period of time, but that's extremely not an option IMO. I have a history of some pretty upsetting experiences inpatient that my therapist is very aware of and are why she agrees that it's an avoid as long as possible scenario. Plus I'm a SAHM of 2 young kids. A toddler and a 5yo who goes to school but is Autistic and needs a decent amount of support during home time. It would be catastrophic on home life for me to go to a residential placement.

They didn't say I'm too broken in so many words, but it's what it boiled down to. After doing the assessed and talking as a team they let me know ""Our team can't recommend outpatient care and recommends placement in a residential facility"" was pretty much what they said. Explaining it was due to the factors I mentioned before. 

I gave my therapist a heads up and we're going to chat tomorrow. But she can't really do anything about it. 

There have always been circles run around where I fit since I was a very young child. Diagnosis, treatment options, even schools when that was relevant.

1,"Alright here's the good and simple facts. 

1. Your life may be shitty but there are good things about it, go look out the window at birds, get a cup of coffee and a muffin and just sit in the sun, find enjoyment in the work you do or just pick up a book, if you need suggestions I know of a couple fiction series that are great.  

2. People arround you love and care about you, even though you may not think so. When you have thoughts like ""you will never be good enough"" and "" you are just a failure"" that is simply not true.  People care, even if it's just the guy who comes into the gas station for some chips and a soda, people value you and what you bring.  Never feel like you are worthless and never think you don't matter, because you do, if you want to just talk, I know I'm a stranger, but maby that will help in some way.

3. If this is the worst life has to offer it can only get better from here right? When a person is on the bottom step of the ladder of life one can only go up. Even if it's not fast, even if you step back a couple of times you can only go up.  And you may be on the bottom rung again, but that doesn't mean you can jump off the ladder entirely.  Keep trying, keep moving, slowly, one step at a time, the more you work, the easier it becomes

4. Find something or someone who relies on you.  If you don't already, go get a pet if you can, it doesn't have to be a purebread, it could be something as simple as a beta fish, just find something you can love and love it.  Love that thing/animal/person and don't stop, for instance my doggo is always there to wake me up, and wags her tail every time I look at her.  It always helps me get up in the morning and do what I need, just so I can hug her again

5. Go talk to people. I know it's hard to talk about this stuff, and thank you for reaching out on reddit, but talk to friends, family, co-workers they can help more then anybody on this stupid app could

6. I know how hard it is to be in and out of the hospital, but you need to keep working and functioning. If you sit and let yourself go, then you will become weak and unable to do much, that will only worsen depression.  I want to help you, I want to keep you here in this world, I want you to be as happy as you can. Don't just compartmentalize or hide stuff, because that only digs a deeper hole for yourself",BillNyeNaziSpy6767,l6mj0c

Generally speaking, of the 3 disorders listed, anorexia is by a huge margin the riskiest condition to manage outpatient due to known mortality rates associated with the disorder. 

Add on metabolic and biological processes being impacted by both untreated anorexia and possibly psychiatric medications, I can understand why an outpatient psychiatrist may feel this is out of their scope of practice. 

If treatment for anorexia is an option, that may be a prelude. That care may also be interdisciplinary and can include psychiatry with a specialty focus on intersections of eating disorder and other mental health concerns.",randomlygeneratedadv,smaw06

As the video shows, teenagers with anorexia do much better with family-based treatment than with individual therapy with office visits.  
  
Something that can help with anorexia and also mood disorders - relaxation.  
  
As this article explains, studies show that relaxation methods help with anorexia, although of course you have to be extremely careful about exercise, as this is usually part of the problem.   
  
https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/blog/the-benefits-of-relaxation-training-in-anorexia-recovery  
  
About relaxation, the research on controlled breathing is amazing. A study with war veterans convinced the VA to recommend this for vets with PTSD.   
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPyiddgWlfE&t=115s  
  
DBT - an excellent therapy for behavior problems - recommends a number of coping methods, including paced breathing.  
  
It's very important to calm down. It's good for you at the dinner table and your parents.  
A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which helps people who have BPD, recommends this - breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out, and breathe 5 seconds in-breath and 7 seconds out-breath till you feel OK.  
  
  
When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
   
   
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
   
   
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
   
   
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
   
   
When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.

  
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
   
   
The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication. 

  
Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety and bipolar disorder.

1,"Do not sign anything saying you resigned/quit or write an email stating that (assuming you‚Äôre in the US due to Banfield chains) as that will make you ineligible for employment. 

If they email, reply in writing that you are happy to resume your normal schedule in 2 weeks and look forward to returning. 

Your boss will need to fire you if your lack of availability during the next 2 weeks is a deal breaker. And that will allow you to submit for unemployment to hold over until your next job. 

Take care and focus on your treatment.",randomlygeneratedadv,t2p3sk
2,I think it would be helpful just to let the statement stand as is and focus on your own mental health. As long as you were upfront with them on your applications and anytime after about your mental health status you should be considered a protected class and while they certainly have the option to let you go it seems like they are trying to push you to resign because that will relieve the company of any responsibility after the fact. Stand your ground and be confident that you have rights and the company has obligations they need to meet. If you resign you won‚Äôt be afforded unemployment protections or other legal rights.,SnooWalruses3483,t2p3sk
3,thank you !! do you think I could get fired due to being out for the 2 weeks and be ineligible to get unemployment if so ?,cat1513,t2p3sk
4,thank you! yes that‚Äôs the reason I was just like no I won‚Äôt be doing that. if I were too it‚Äôd look like I quit and the company would slide by on the legal stuff without worry.,cat1513,t2p3sk
5,"Yes, you're almost certainly an 'at will' employee so you can be fired for virtually any reason that doesn't fall under a protected class (e.g., gender, race). Your boss can fire you because they don't like your haircut or if they feel like your performance sucks. Or they can just wake up one day and feel like doing it with zero rationale.

But being formally terminated almost certainly means that you will be entitled to unemployment since it wasn't your choice. But if you willingly walk away, then they can submit your resignation email or paperwork to your state and you'll be denied unemployment (which they pay into). 

So prioritize your treatment and let them decide. If they fire you, immediately file for unemployment. If not, go back to work (but maybe start looking elsewhere if you think they will 'hold' it over you).",randomlygeneratedadv,t2p3sk
0,"I'm sorry that you have to go through that. I know how hard it can be because I also went through something traumatic. In my case, there were times when I had tremors all over my body and I am also just grateful to God for the support and love I received even from people I've never talked to for a long time. I think the best thing to do first of all is to try and stay level headed and calm...allow yourself to find comfort in your family's love. I went on prescribed medicine for the first few weeks but they only made me feel groggy...and I started feeling afraid that I'd be dependent on them. What I did instead was slowly drop my meds and replaced it with natural supplements. I multi-dosed on the Intra juice by Lifestyles and it helped to make me less anxious until slowly I started recovering. I am not sure if the product is available in your country but it can be a real life saver. Try searching for lifestyles.net and see if you have that in your country.

1,"For me they didn't really have a choice. I got caught by the police about to OD on sleeping pills so they legally had to take me to either an ER or this place called Mind 24/7 (basically a psychiatric ER because actual ERs are garbage when it comes to psych care). I went to Mind 24 and that admitted me for the night and found a placement for me in the morning.

My parents could have signed me out AMA but due to the circumstances they probably would've been reported to DCS and a doctor could've gotten an emergency court order to keep me against my and my parents' will. 

Don't get it confused though, the therapy you'll get inpatient is worthless. If you're not an immediate risk to yourself or others your best bet is to try and get enrolled in an intensive outpatient program (IOP). If your parents won't go for that or any therapy whatsoever, there's a lot of good YouTube videos you can use going over various therapy strategies. I would recommend researching DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy). That's what I do in my partial hospitalization program and it's really helpful.

If you are or at any point become a risk to yourself or others, call or text 988. It's the national suicide hotline for the US. They'll either send the police (if you're a super immediate risk) or a crisis team (if you can wait a bit) to your house to evaluate you and then they can get you resources.

If you're not in the US just look up the suicide/crisis hotline for your country and call. Best of luck to you, hope you get the help you need.",Cable_Minimum,17n0keq

ETA: I also see an outside therapist besides the therapy I get at PHP, and it is nice to have that extra support of going to be with my peers (at Program) and be able to be myself while I'm there, plus have an outside person to talk to about other things I don't want to share in Group.

0,"To answer your question they only drug test people who are on medications involving  antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti anxiety, etc.
You‚Äôll be safe if your not prescribed on any medications for a mental illness. The partial hospitalization program is pretty lockdown they take your belongings and your phone when you walk in, they also check your shoes to see if your not bringing any drugs and dangerous objects that could be cause self harm. I‚Äôve been in the partial hospitalization program when I was 15 and it‚Äôs not fun but not bad either. My program ran from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm and is structured like a school only with less people. This involves a daily schedule with periods, each hour/period involves activities and lessons which consists of coping skills, mindful thinking, reframing, self reflection, and learning/understanding yourself. Most of the lessons are boring as I remember spacing out and learning nothing but if you want to better yourself, I recommend paying attention and contributing with the lesson. If you stay engaged and ask questions not only will the lesson be helpful but it will make time go by quickly. I remember some kids would run away as soon as they were dropped off near the entrance of the building but eventually they would get caught and brought back to the hospital with nasty attitudes. The staff are kind and willing to teach and engage with everybody although that may depend on the place you go to. The staff in my hospital loved to socialize and were friendly which made me feel much more comfortable being there. I remember there was a girl who was suicidal and was brought to a safe room (always with her consent) and while she was in there staff members would talk to her kindly for hours without leaving her behind. They were passionate to help us and are there for you whenever you need to talk or have any questions. The program also has lunch time and breaks where you have the opportunity to socialize and engage with your peers. I highly recommend that you socialize and make friends so that you can enjoy going and have another reason to attend the program. I had a hard time making friends due to my paranoia and the day felt like an eternity. I loved the lunch as we were given two good options which consisted of a salad meal and a regular meal (sandwich or pizza, juice, beans, and a snack). During lunch we would either talk about how our days are going or watch a movie. During break everyone played card games, board games, and video games. Near the end of the day we would go to a classroom with a teacher who will teach basic school subjects like math, english, history, etc. During this time I had an opportunity to finish all of the school work that I missed during that school year. Once the lessons are over you will be able to get your belongings including your cellphone back and leave the building. It may be a locked environment but it‚Äôs not bad when you have caring staff members and peers/friends who want to watch you succeed.",Particular_Tadpole27,vi7wz5

2,"Our PHP is 18+ and we don't do any of that shit. Hell, that sounds more like when I was in freaking jail! In our PHP, we come and go as we please, and if we want to leave, we can. We just have to sign ourselves out and tell the counselor we are leaving. I spend most of my 2 days a week there (thank you COVID for knocking me from 5 days to 2 days (and then no days when the Center was closed), which they never changed back after re-opening ahahahha lucky me!) wandering around the hallways, or going downstairs to visit the pharmacy staff, or sit outside for a while. I have ADD (just found THAT out) and am autistic, so it is safer for me to be able to go outside if I need to, especially with my main disorder. Sometimes it flairs up really bad (I will have BAD impulses and urges) so I really need to be away from people and chill out when that happens. It happens more than I would like to admit, so I am always wandering the hallways or outside. I, truthfully, am only in the PHP because the court ordered me there as part of my Probation once I had been released from jail, where I had spent a year. Once I am off Probation in December, I really don't have to go anymore if I don't want to. Only 6 more months to go! I think I might just stay in it, even though they can't do much for my main disorder there anyhow, and they know it, so I am just left alone a lot of the time. We do worksheets and talk about stuff in Group, and we watch a movie every Friday. We do a lot of work with anxiety, depression (I am dx'ed with both) and coping skills, self-image, stuff like that. I will admit that some of the worksheets catch my interest, and they often are very insightful. They get ya thinking that's for sure.

I get along with everyone there (one guy creeps me out, but he is just a creepy kind of dude and has NO filter...yikes) and with all the counselors. It is a nice place to get away from home for a couple days from 9am-3pm and it is nice to be in a place where you feel you belong. It is very comfortable and pleasant, and I will admit, I don't mind going there much at all. Just getting up at 7:30am to get my van at 8:30am SSUUUUUUUUCCCCCKKKKKS. I am lucky that transportation is provided! :D That is the worst of it though.

That's my experience, as an adult in PHP, which isn't much different than a juvenile Program would be (I don't know if our counseling center has one), content-wise. Good luck!",SadAndAnxiousBean,vi7wz5

0,">In those moments where I closed my eyes and allowed the tactile hallucinations from the drug rock me to sleep, I was totally and utterly at peace. I wasn‚Äôt afraid, I had no regrets, no desire to experience anything again, I was ready to die. Not only had I accepted my imminent death, I welcomed it wholeheartedly.

It's because your death allowed you to let go on a deeper level than normal. This is why mindfulness of death is so prominent in Buddhism. That peace was your real home, a tiny peek at what everyone is talking about. A taste of freedom. In our daily lives we're so caught up in the affairs of the world that we rarely get to experience this, but it's always there. A common metaphor is a bright moon obscured by clouds.

>I hear about people self-aborting attempts because they realize somewhere along the way that they do want to live and I wonder why that didn‚Äôt happen to me.

When you know you're going to die it clears away the concerns clouding your judgement allowing what's more important to rise to the surface. If you've lost your attachment to worldly affairs, or your desire for annihilation outweighs your other desires, then you won't be too bothered by death. That's all. Why is death necessarily something to be feared? It's only natural to die, but it strikes at the very core of our being so we struggle against the inevitable. Ironically our clinging and grasping is what pulls us away from peace, but we don't know any better. We're trying to find happiness, but we're ignorant about how to do it.

>I replay this over and over again in my head, remembering the tranquility I felt in that moment and fear that I‚Äôll never feel it again, not until I actually die.

You don't have to die to feel it again. Technically speaking you don't even have to do anything. Think back to that moment where tranquility set in as you patiently waited for death. Did you create those feelings? You don't have to chase peace. Just close your eyes and let the peace come to you. If you try to turn towards it you'll turn against it, but that peace is always available if you know what you're doing. Consider yourself lucky you know it's there now. If you want to experience that peace again you have to train your mind and heart, to die before you die. Explore Buddhism and start meditating. Not just watching your breath or being in the present moment, but a broad range of mental cultivation. You're welcome to ask for help.",,187637g

2,"Wow.  Hey, I've been there.  On all sides of the psychiatric equation.  Sometimes I wanted to go . . . sometimes I was forced to go . . . sometimes went there via the emergency room . . . . 

I do have to point out however that I started to get better when I started listening to professionals.  If your therapist thinks you should go inpatient perhaps ask ""why"" and ponder the answer?  

I am a type A personality with some spectacular coping mechanisms.  I can appear fine real quick.  My therapist recognized that an inpatient environment would force me to work on some better coping skills and get some stability.  

Have had moments where I swore I wasn't suicidal or homicidal but a decade later looked back and went ""ooooh yeah maybe I was a little dicey but didn't realize it"". 

Feel free to message me!!  I have had over 6 long term stays and well over 10 emergency room visits that weren't quite a week but were more than 24 hours.

Secondly, it‚Äôs really a place (again my experience as a patient) to be observed and kept safe with minimal treatment.

12,"I am going to modify and repeat some advice that I have given.

I think your therapist is doing you a service. The internet is great but they are not invested in you. They will spout off advice and then go watch a Cat video. That being said reach out to me if you want, and this advice comes from years of experience living with bipolar. I have felt the way you do in a mania. At times I felt great and then it turned into a scary nightmare.  Your mind is your most valuable resource. More valuable than temporary freedom. I say temporary because you will get better and then have real freedom. On the other hand this could go bad very quickly and you want to have every advantage at your disposal. 

We live in a very individualistic culture and value freedom. However, this just makes it harder to make this decision on your own. It also makes it harder for others with those values to feel they have the necessity to interfere with your life. This means that ultimately you have to make the decision before something worse happens. You will get through this. 

As for how they will treat you, if you check yourself in you will be treated very well. More like a hospital gown. After about 3 days you will probably feel a lot better, but since it is your mental health if I were you I wouldn't care if it were three months. Three months recovery from an illness is a blessing. You can spend some of this time in the safe hospital and then go home and further your recovery. The advice and more importantly the treatment that you will get will start you on a long journey to recovery. If you need a metaphor, right now your like the Fat person at the gym, the hospital is your gym and doctor your trainer. If you do what they say when they say it and then also focus on your inner mental health you will be mentally healthy again. Remember that positive metaphor when you go. It's a health hospital.

15,"When I went, I wasn‚Äôt suicidal or homicidal either. It didn‚Äôt do much for me, but it was quite a long time ago and had more to do with my attitude and such. I think, as others have said, that much depends on the facility you‚Äôd be going to. It is good, in many ways, to get a bit of respite from the world at large and stay in a controlled and structured environment, even at the cost of your shoelaces and mobile phone. I‚Äôve thought about checking myself in because I feel so overwhelmed. But, really, what would do the same, or likely better, for me and the way my mind works, the way I function, etc., is a retreat center. Someplace that does silent retreats out in the middle of nowhere would be my ideal. There‚Äôs still the basic structure of meal times. Some would offer group meditation times, yoga, or things of that ilk. It‚Äôs good to be with people without the stress of it. Where you can have the company without the complications. Just there to get away, decompress, and recenter yourself. Maybe that would be worth a look as an alternative. ",,aq7ce3
16,"To find a place I would check with your insurance or call 211. Talk to your therapist too as they would be a good resource.  If they're affiliated with an inpatient hospital they could reserve a bed for you. You might still have to go to the emergency department then transferred to inpatient. 
Inpatient is for people with symptoms that are acute in nature. Suicidal thoughts, psychosis, depression, severe anxiety, etc. It can also be used as almost a time out from life where the focus should solely be on you and getting your medication correct. 
It's understandable you don't want your laces and phone taken away. They do that for safety and treatment. Laces is a safety factor not just for you but the other residents so it's not personal. Not having your phone will suck but a lot of issues are cause by the phone. Taking it away will help you focus only on yourself.
There is some truth to people saying it's a trap. A lot of people go in expecting it to fix whatever is wrong without actually doing any of the treatment. Also be wary of some of the direct care support staff. They are generally minimally trained and some will be not be helpful maybe unintentionally harmful.
As with all types of treatment this is something you have to buy into. Going through the motions to get out will not be helpful. Treatment doesn't end when you're discharged it continues with outpatient care. Everyone I've seen that was successful focused on themselves, socialized but more in a polite manner rather than attempting to build new friendships, advocated for themselves, and took therapy/treatment seriously.",DinosAteSherbert,aq7ce3

And then repeat this every night until you start to feel good (this thing works by tricking your brain into thinking that you are just fine and remember if you think negative your brain will make you feel negative. If you think positive your brain will make you feel positive. Brain is the most powerfull machine and you can control it just by thinking positive.) Try to look to something that makes you laugh. (Like a funny youtuber, a funny movie, a funny show). Laugh boosts the levels of happy hormone in your brain. Because laugh is the best medicine. And most important do a sport (run, bike, ski, snowboarding, skate, swim, and so on) and try to eat healthy food, do a hobby etc.. And maybe you can go see a psychologist.

You cannot compare yourself to how others learn, because everyone learns differently. Some people read a book once and know it, others learn with their hands, others learn visually, some people need to write something a thousand times before it sinks in.

You need to take some time to find out what optimises your learning, and then apply it to what you wish to learn.

1,"If you knew me, you'd think I was an extrovert. However, I am a complete hermit. This WFH period made me realize how much I love not having to leave the house, and I have registered with Flexjobs in the hope to find remote work. It's just the husband and me (well, and a small dog and cat), so I have a pretty chill home environment. 

I can easily do most of my job at home, except two things: speaking at events, and tabling events. Both require me to speak to people (obviously) and really try to recruit volunteers for my agency. I adore my agency, and my boss, but if I never have to ""go in"" to an office again, or give presentations, I'll be mighty happy.

So, all in all, I am less stressed, have time to do things I want to do, and my husband and I can chill and play video games to our hearts' content. My therapist noticed a positive change in my moods too, so it's obviously not just an internal change.",TheRottenKittensIEat,hjcu7k

0,"It's difficult to say whether it is legal or not, since I know nothing about PA law on this or really any other subjects. I can only speak to the ""acceptable"" part, to which the short answer is no, for one big reason: lack of supervision.

The lack of any kind of clinical supervision should be a massive red flag. Typically post-grad licensure has some sort of supervision requirement, and the fact that you're not getting any meaningful supervision means you might have a hard time convincing a licensing board that the hours you have put in there should count toward obtaining licensure.

I'm unable to say whether your facility is violating any laws regarding client care, with regard to treatment and discharge planning and the like, since again, not in PA and unfamiliar with legislature surrounding mandated PHP, but at the very least it doesn't seem like a good work environment or a good environment to grow your skills in anticipation of post-licensure independent practice. Atrociously high turnover is probably reflective of this.

To put it bluntly, maybe consider fleeing the general vicinity of this dumpster fire before it gets worse.",schm1547,52568j
1,"Howdy Jason.

Yes.  Most assureadly yes, I've expirenced this and it pisses me off to no end.

Most programs I've worked on are run by penny pinching misers who at best judicially bring up points about how to run a tight org and who at worst have cut my benefits, hours and insurance while they take five-figure bonuses home to their boat they never use and wife who hates them.  Not to mention the fact that these programs are woefully underfunded by societies at large, but that's a whole 'nother soapbox that would be a wall of text scree of mine talking about how we can somehow buy all the shotguns, bailiffs, prisons, judges, patrol cars, and bullets....that could be negated by actually addressing the mental suffering of the people's behaviors we supposedly want to decrease. 

How close you are to achieving your own goals is a consideration, if you feel like you can finish up and jet rather than find a new spot and try to fit into their system is up to you.  I finally found a good agency in this state, and my co director's advice was, ""Never have loyalty to any agency."" 

It's like the ultimate self-care move to get the hell away from toxic environments like you're describing.  You sound like a versatile clinician who doesn't shy away from tough situations. 

[I had a great time working for a program with this modality for three years](http://www.namihelps.org/assets/PDFs/fact-sheets/General/Assertive-Community-Treatment.pdf). Had my own ""Wellness Group"" that was like a Martha Stewart Living Hour, we delivered meds, we took folks shopping, we got people to their appointments, and we were part of their lives.  It was for folks suffering from SPMI with co-occurring  diags to stay out of the hospital, and even then, we would ensure that hospital stays were transitioned appropriately. 

My career was mostly children and families, but it makes the most sense to me to provide treatment in this modality.  I hope that you're able to get to a place that won't treat you like a billing machine.  /u/schm1547 has a lot of good points.  Best of luck and keep us updated.

It sounds like your hormones may be playing a role in how you are feeling right now, so I would suggest ordering the [Menopause Panel](https://www.privatemdlabs.com/lp/menopause-testing.php) or [Menopause Discovery Pro](https://www.privatemdlabs.com/lab_tests.php?view=category_result&show=3846&category=6&ven=Q&search=) from [private md labs](https://www.privatemdlabs.com/lab_tests.php?view=all). These tests will help provide insight into your hormone levels, which can give us more information about how menopause might be affecting your physical and mental health. 

I would also suggest reaching out for professional help if possible - whether it's talking to a therapist or finding support groups in your area - as this can provide an outlet for expressing yourself and connecting with others who understand what you're going through. Additionally, finding ways to practice self-care such as getting enough sleep, eating healthy meals, exercising regularly, and taking time for yourself can help improve both physical and mental wellbeing during this difficult time.

Actually, it‚Äôs not all at once‚Äîit‚Äôll come in spurts as you are healing. I‚Äôve been in therapy for 9ish years now? Maybe 10? And my body is only just now feeling safe enough to address the small bits of memories that are resurfacing from my childhood trauma. 

I have also been in psychiatric units...6 times now? And in PHP (partial hospitalization) and IOP (intensive outpatient) and residential. 

Firstly, if you feel unsafe, talk to your psych and therapist. Unsafe being, do you have a plan for SI? Do you have materials? Or is it the feeling that you might lose control? Admitting you have SI doesn‚Äôt automatically mean admission to the psychiatric unit, if you‚Äôre afraid of that. They will ask you questions about whether you have a plan to figure out how best to treat you. Being admitted to the psychiatric unit can help, but they also want to make intervention as little traumatizing if they can help it, and the psych unit can be traumatizing. 

PHP is helpful‚Äîif you or your mental health team think you need more support short of hospitalization, PHP means you are in the care of other mental health professionals for 6 or so hours in a day. It‚Äôs like a full time job where you can be supervised while getting treatment. IOP is shorter, a half day, and does the same thing. I‚Äôve had mixed and negative experiences with PHP, IOP, but that‚Äôs because of my own circumstances. It was helpful for many of my other peers, though. 

Residential is helpful, but there are usually wait times, especially for a program geared toward your specific needs‚Äîlike for me, it‚Äôs hard finding a trauma program. The treatment modality might not work for you, but it also could. It depends very much on each person‚Äôs needs. 

That brings me back to hospitalization. Psychiatric units aren‚Äôt all horrible, but some can be unhelpful, which is why your mental health team might try PHP or a lesser form of treatment if appropriate for your circumstances. Ask if they know which hospitals are better. 

The horrific experiences tend toward just how foreign this type of hospitalization is. People aren‚Äôt used to having to take off clothes, have their body checked for self harm scars. Or for anything else that might hurt you, other patients, or staff members. They are or should be very respectful of your privacy at the same time. All your belongings will be checked, too, and dangerous items removed and put into storage, like string, etc. if it seems weird that they took something, it‚Äôs usually because some other patient figured out how to hurt themselves or others with it. Or they learned of the hazard from another hospital and adjusted their protocol. 

Having this level of supervision can be traumatizing. I know I hated not knowing how long they‚Äôd keep me, and such, but know you still have the right and ability to ask questions. I was in one place where they didn‚Äôt care about accessibility for my deafness, another place that tried but were weird about interpreters, and another place that booked an interpreter all day every day. The completely inaccessible unit also kept making mistakes with my medicine, and I had to correct them. If they try to give you something without explaining what it‚Äôs for, you have the right of refusal. I know of another unit that tends to give Seroquel to everyone, which I disagree with. I haven‚Äôt been there thankfully. 

Some of the horror stories are based in truth. Some are traumatizing because it‚Äôs so foreign to be on a psychiatric unit. But if you need help, or feel in danger to yourself, don‚Äôt hesitate to get help. Just be sure to know your medications, know what your treatment plan is, and ask questions. 

My first two hospitalizations were traumatizing to me, but the other 4 were not because I understood how things worked by that point. 

So, reach out to your mental health team and see what they have to say. If it‚Äôs an emergency, say so in order for them to reply quickly. If it‚Äôs even more of an emergency, go straight to the ER. 

I am based in Illinois so my experience with the laws can be local to my area, but your area should have its own laws about what rights mentally ill people retain in an emergency situation. 

I hope this helps.",holly1231,nk2i9l

There‚Äôs a lot of people and they are all going through some pretty serious stuff like you and sometimes that alone can be a lot. My best example is my son, with this last trip, he screamed like he was being murdered until they got him sedated and bit a chunk out of a nurse. There‚Äôs some stress, but it‚Äôs overall sometimes the best place to be if you need help.

10,"It depends on insurance. You can also do self pay‚Äîthere‚Äôs often a bit of a discount since you‚Äôre saving them insurance wrangling time. 

I‚Äôd go ahead and look at the different PHP programs available in your area. Most of them will have reviews online, too, but take them with a grain of salt. (Just like psychiatric units). Some programs work well with people, and some times it‚Äôs not a good fit for a particular person. There‚Äôs always something to learn from them, in any case. Be sure to advocate for yourself, because you are an equal partner in your care. 

With HMO, you will need a referral. With PPO, you usually don‚Äôt need a referral from a doctor. Give them a call (or if you‚Äôre like me, email). They‚Äôll take your insurance information, and talk with you a bit. They‚Äôll then schedule a time for intake‚Äîit could be in person, video call, or a phone call. It‚Äôs usually an hour or so long. It‚Äôs called intake even though it‚Äôs also a chance for you to see if it‚Äôs a good fit, because at the end of it you can decide to choose their program, they‚Äôve already got the info they need. 

The program checks with your insurance to find out what your coverage is like, and they‚Äôll let you know before you start the program. They will also tell you if insurance requires a referral. 

I hope this helps, and lemme know if you have more questions!",holly1231,nk2i9l

He told me early before we started dating that he had it and I've read the symptoms and how to deal with it. I understand that I can't fix it and that it is a difficult situation...but it's only been a month and I think it's breaking me up inside.

When he has episodes he backs away or doesn't text and it hurts. I want to be understanding but I feel like am giving up way too much. I feel like I should be upset but then I keep remembering that this person has a disorder and it puts limits on them...but I don't want them to be defined by that either. 

As if to add the cherry on top this is an LDR...which makes it harder. Like I can't just hop off work to see him or otherwise. I am fairly limited to when he wants to talk...and I feel like am being pushed away. 

I love him and I want to make this work, but I don't know when I should call him out or if I should give him a break. 

Does...that makes sense? ",,492nsy
1,"Maybe late to this, but how did you know to go get evaluated? Like, what kind of feelings/thoughts made you realize you had a disorder?

3,"Hey there! If you have ever been hospitalized or went to group therapy sessions, how was it? 
I'm a nursing student having worked in a mental institut last summer. I noticed that we did not received too many male borderline personality disorders. I was told they aren't as apparent because men tend to be act outwards (as in picking fights in a bar over self harm) What are your thoughts on that?",WL138,492nsy
4,I'm male and pretty sure I have it too!,,492nsy
5,"Hey, same! We seem to be such a rare species. ",curxxx,492nsy

1. His disorder is not his fault and it's nice that you recognize that, but it's not yours either.  You don't have to be held hostage in a situation you resent by it, and if your stick around but resent it it won't be healthy for either of you.

2. When he has episodes, you need to be clear that you understand but can't engage it.  Set clear boundaries, and stick to them.  The best specific example would be if he's freaking out say something like ""I like/love you but can't/won't respond right now, but I will text/call you at √ó:√ó√ó.""  The text/call him before x:xx and absolutely NEVER after it, or it will make damage you probably can't repair.  Never lie to someone with BPD, and don't flake on them if you Dont have an amazingly good reason, or they will be more hurt than you can imagine from such a small thing.",BPDama,492nsy
7,"I can't say exactly, but I'd just sort of always known I was..different, emotionally, from other people.

If you're struggling it doesn't matter if it's ""really"" something wrong with you or you just being dramatic, the only qualifier for if you need help or not is if you feel like you need help.  

Basically, if you have to ask, you know the answer.  Better to have a therapist say you're fine and give you some helpful tips than to go untreated, right?",BPDama,492nsy
8,"Daily life is, I would imagine, fairly similar in most ways.  I wake up, go to work, come home, cook dinner, prepare lunch for the next day, go to sleep, repeat.  Hang out with friends or do most chores/hobbies on the weekend.

There are some key differences, of course.  Most notably I have very bad impulse control and pretty much always stay up until 3 or 4 am watching ""just one more episode"" and possibly getting excessively drunk.  I'm almost always tired during the week.  Impulse control has also led to me being a bit overweight.  It's super easy to binge eat/drink and really hard to motivate myself to exercise or actually stick to a workout routine.  Routines in generally are really hard to keep and I wouldn't say I really have one.  My apartment is also really mess because ""it's just one bag on the floor/dish in the sink"" can pretty quickly escalate to ""it's already a disaster whats the harm in adding just one more?  I'll clean tomorrow.""  It's downright insane that I still believe I can do something just one more time or that I'll actually get to it tomorrow, but it's halfway between rationalizing and thinking I'll really change I guess.

Similarly, I'm very antisocial after too many bad experiences.  I have a few friends who've known me for a very long time, but generally new friendships tend to be intense and then burn out leaving me hurt so I generally avoid them.  Same thing for dating, which I really haven't put much effort into the last year and a half because when the best case scenario is ""it will end really badly and I'll never entirely get over her"" it's pretty hard to feel like trying.  So I often do things alone, which is fine I guess, but I'd definitely like to get better at socializing/dating.",BPDama,492nsy
9,"I have never received any variety of treatment for it.  I was diagnosed and never followed up on anything, so I can't really comment towards that.  I've heard it's exceptionally difficult, though.

As for why there are fewer men with BPD I really can't say if it's males actually having it less frequently or just it being under reported.  I don't know if men in general are less likely to self harm, but I do know in my case I've never self harmed but have acted aggressively.  Also a possible factor is that in general it's my understanding men are more successful at carying out suicide attempts, so if a failed suicide attempt is what finally got someone the help they needed it'd follow that more women would be in such a situation.

I'm not at all qualified to say why it's more common in women, but I'd speculate it's a trifecta of it being under reported/diagnosed in men, it being more physiologically common in women, and societal pressures towards women making it more common and more easily diagnosed than in men.  But again, I'm not at all qualified to say that and am just speculating based on undoubtedly incomplete information.",BPDama,492nsy

When is a good time to bring up how the episode is affecting me? The past few days have been...on and off. I understand he has issues but it is also affecting me to and I don't know how long I can act as if I'm alright when I'm not. ",,492nsy
11,"Something pretty big I guess I overlooked: certain things trigger me and remind me of things/people and I get really sad or angry or both.  A few certain things at work tend to remind me of ex girlfriends or close friends I lost, but I'm blanking on exactly what at the moment.  Some songs do the same thing.",BPDama,492nsy
12,"My advice would be say you aren't okay WHEN you feel that way.  A common problem I have with people is they'll put up with me and put up with me and give me no indication there's a problem, then something pushes them too far and they leave, but from my end it seems out of nowhere.

This isn‚Äôt her fault. She isn‚Äôt a bad person or a bad kid, she is mentally ill. Your wife threatening to leave your family will make everything worse. The worst possible thing you can do is take this shit personally. Your daughter needs help. Blaming her for the outbursts and the self medicating isn‚Äôt going to do shit. Sorry but if I were you, I‚Äôd find her some sort of boarding facility for mentally unstable teens. She can get an education and be constantly monitored by nurses and doctors.

It is your responsibility to make sure she gets the help she needs through therapy and/or medication. The most important thing you need to remember is that she's 16 years old.

Now what I‚Äôm about to say isn‚Äôt in any way to disrespect your beliefs and/or teachings, but if she doesn‚Äôt want to engage in religious activities, don‚Äôt make her, it‚Äôll just make y‚Äôall‚Äôs rift grow even more steadily. She‚Äôs trying to figure out who she is as person, and from my experience in my 19 years of living, I still haven‚Äôt found myself either, I‚Äôm not even sure if anybody ever finds who they truly are.

And you have to be there to support her no matter how ‚Äúobscene‚Äù she looks, she seems like she‚Äôs a fragile being who just wants to be able express herself, and the resentment that she has towards y‚Äôall might have to with y‚Äôall‚Äôs judgments towards her. She‚Äôs misunderstood and if you really take the time to hear her out and not just try to push her into reforming to y‚Äôall‚Äôs expectations, y‚Äôall will realize the nice girl you thought left has been there the whole time, just hiding under too much baggage to handle by herself. 

My dad told me ‚Äúdrugs aren‚Äôt the problem, they‚Äôre the solution‚Äù and I agree with him, but not in the sense that they‚Äôre necessarily good, but when someone is addicted to a drug wether it be prescription or street drugs, it‚Äôs because that‚Äôs the only thing they have to turn to. Nobody with mental health problems want to vent out their feelings just to be ridiculed. She might just be over encumbered with thoughts that she‚Äôs suppressing to herself because she thinks nobody would give a damn.

Once again, I mean no disrespect towards you or your family, I‚Äôm not religious personally but I understand why people are. Mental health is such a tricky thing and the mind is very lucrative, just be there for her, not in a helicopter type of way, but just let her know that she‚Äôs not alone in this. It‚Äôs a damn tough fight but there‚Äôs only so much bad you can endure before your luck starts changing.

As someone who comes from a very religious family I can safely say that I have a very good understanding of what who and when god is a priority in our lives and in this circumstance if you believe god is Lord and loving then you can also believe that God wants you to do the best for your daughter.

A book written 2000 years ago is a fantastic point for guidance but not absolute. Your church can guide you in your decisions but they are not God they are people. At this time it is obvious your at a cross road between your belief and your daughter and no matter what people at the church or a 2000 year old book (written by men) tells you, your family should come first before even the most divine. God would understand as it is his essence to show love, especially to those who are acting 'sinful'.

If I didn't know my best friend for 10+ years, I would've been a goner. Her reminding herself that what my mental illness was making me do was not what I MYSELF would do... then she would've given up too. And if I didn't have anyone around at all that would believe that it wasn't ""just me"", then I would have people that hate me and not people that love me. You need to remember that your daughter, who used to be ""such a good girl"", is still your daughter. And she's still a good girl. And she's dealing with a lot that she can't understand, can't express in the right ways, and she doesn't WANT to deal with it anymore. And she wants it over with because she hates herself, and now everyone in the family seems to hate her too. I promise you that your daughter doesn't understand what is going on in her head, as much as you seem to think that she does. And clearly, you don't understand what is going on either. But in the end, if she wants to kill herself, and you're set on the idea that she IS a burden, then you're never going to see your good girl again. She's still there, but there's plenty of things happening in her brain chemistry that are manifesting in very bad ways because she doesn't know how to cope. 16 year olds don't know how to cope with having a hard class at school, without mental illness on top of it. People with mental illness don't know how to cope with their mental illness from the start, no matter what. Imagine having the magnitude of her mental illness, AND the lack of coping skills that a normal angsty teen would have. And then you calling her a burden because of it. Your daughter isn't going to get better if you don't advocate on her behalf. She's not here right now, her mental illness is. And instead of standing up for who you KNOW your daughter is, a good girl, you're further separating her from herself by completely blaming her for what she's going through.

0,"I think what you‚Äôre describing could be symptoms of psychosis or anxiety but it‚Äôs really hard to say without seeing a fuller picture. Mental health isn‚Äôt always cut and dry‚Äî over the years I‚Äôve been diagnosed as schizophrenic and schizo-effective, but now people say I have C-PTSD/BPD and am prone to psychotic breakdowns.

Anyway, from the other post you sound young and scared about your parents‚Äô reaction (I don‚Äôt blame you). I can‚Äôt tell you that mental health professionals are all perfect angels and that meds will always work, but if this is something that‚Äôs really bothering and/or hindering you, I‚Äôd recommend at least starting small. Tell someone (parents, school counselor, whoever) about about how you feel and make it clear you don‚Äôt want to be on medication. Also, research different kinds of therapies and medicines. (Honestly if I could go back in time and give myself one piece of advice about going to doctors it would be to read up about medicines.) Therapy can help, and it‚Äôs a lot better than sitting alone with your thoughts building up.

If you really don‚Äôt want to go down that route, I‚Äôd at least suggest getting into some forums or other communities dedicated to mental health, where people can vent. Again, this is all if you really feel you need it.

I‚Äôm just gonna say this real quick, because it bears repeating, symptoms like hallucinations/unreality/anxiety don‚Äôt automatically make you psychotic. People are unique in their experiences and the way they experience their mental illness. Try not to get really upset about all of these ‚Äòwhat ifs‚Äô, especially by people on the internet who don‚Äôt know you and stay safe. ",averysadcat,7l86pa

1) Read this article on the [five stages of recovery](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-five-stages-of-recovery.html) about the *other* party, seeing where they are among those five stages.

2) (erased because it didn't apply here)

3) Rather than just take him to a therapist, I would have him evaluated by a board-certified psychopharmacologist, because what you wrote suggests problems therapists are not always equipped to deal with. For such MDs, I suggest looking [here]( http://doctor.webmd.com/find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry). If or when hospitalization becomes an issue, I suggest looking [here](https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/), and moreover if he is drinking hard, using street drugs or abusing prescription medications, because *if* he is, it's crucial that he be treated for that first and foremost. 

4) If his depression proves to be as or more the result of having been [in-struct-ed](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=social%20constructionism), [programmed]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=mind+programming), [conditioned](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=operant+classical+conditioning), [socialized](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=socialization+psychology) and/or [normalized](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=normalization+social+psychology) to beliefs, values, ideals, principles, convictions, rules, codes, regulations and requirements about how one should / must / ought / have to be that are grossly unrealistic, the better therapies for that will be the [CBTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) including [REBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy), collegiate [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking), [schema therapy](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=schema+therapy), and [CPT]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_processing_therapy), though he may respond well to and get a quick lift-off with [this](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) and [this](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/04/critical-thinking-and-logical-fallacies.html) *if* he is at stage three or higher on that list of five stages. But one does need to be motivated to use that empirical-observation-based method. 

In whatever event as regards therapists, I strongly suggest that you interview *them* as though they were applying for a job with *your* company, as well as using the *PT* website to look over which therapies any given therapist is certified to use.",not-moses,5lnvkn
