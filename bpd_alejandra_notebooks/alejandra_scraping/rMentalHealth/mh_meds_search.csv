3,Anxiety meds,"Good evening,

I have bad anxiety and depression. I'm currently on prozac 40mg. It was working at first, but now I don't notice that it is doing anything.  I have been on it for a couple years now.  My dr tried switching me to Lexapro but the side effects of weight gain were terrible as well as a few others.

9,32F missing ADHD meds ,"Hi everyone

Any advice on how I could manage my low mood? I’m really struggling at the moment mentally… it feels impossible to pull myself out of it and I’m just crying all the time. Like even just typing that has made me start crying.

I’m living in a new country and unfortunately I have to pay hundreds of dollars to see a psychiatrist here and have what appears to be a rediagnosis before I can have my meds again. I have all possible paperwork from my home country proving I have a psychiatrist diagnosis and legitimate prescription but it counts for nothing. My appointment is at the end of June and I don’t know how much longer after that I’ll be able to get my meds again. I’m having to ration them. I’m so tired.

I feel really lost right now. I can’t cope with… anything. I can’t carry myself at all. We are financially struggling now too which never helps, but we have been for years.

I just would love some advice on what to do please. When I’m not in a low mood I’m such a goofy, loving person. All I wanna do right now is keep myself locked away but I also have no idea what to do with myself.

19,Taking Meds to early/late [Help],"Hi, 
Yesterday I flew to somewhere else for a vacation, the clock here is one hour earlier. 

I take a few medications which I took at the same time as usual (9 in the morning). Which means that I actually took it an hour earlier here then when I do at home. With all meds this isn’t to big of a problem, but I also take Buproprion (Wellbutrin).
Last night I suddenly became quite depressed. I thought at first it was due to my BPD (I often still get moodswings so this is normal even on my meds). Today while getting up, it was however still there.

Does my system need to adjust to taking it earlier? If yes, how long will this take?
I’m afraid I’ll be depressed the whole vacation… Does anyone know more about this? Or have experiences with this.",1716454232.0,False,1,0,LavenderTree9295,None,1cyo6aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cyo6aw/taking_meds_to_earlylate_help/
20,Situational anxiety meds,"Hey y’all been treated by professionals for the last 3 years with no success. 
 

Im a registered nurse and for the most part im a pretty relaxed dude. People compliment me on how nothing phases me, this is true when I work in critical situations. 

 However what gets me is rude family members, patients, and coworkers. I get so worked up I can’t think, I turn red, it’s embarrassing I break down and can’t function. I have to walk away when I get like this. Not ideal in a hospital. And to give you some insight I’m not a wuss, I brush the majority of stuff off, but recently I had a family member tell me it looks like it’s my first day on the job, I don’t know what I’m doing, this was over something so non emergent and so non educated when it comes to how hospitals work. 

My biggest issue is, when I get home the incident is all I think about. I dwell on it, I lose sleep, I’ll think about it for days, I’ll think the manager is going to call me into the office on my behavior. 

These episodes aren’t a daily occurrence. Sometimes it happens a few times a month sometimes zero. 

I’ve tried plenty of meds trazadone, seroquil, Wellbutrin, depakote— prescribed didn’t try, this is to name a few. 

Ive asked for some as needed Ativan, since this is what works in the hospital. But providers arnt willing to do that. They say we need to fix the root not the aftermath. 

I can’t smoke weed this would shoot my anxiety through the roof.

21,Realizing your dependence on meds,"I (now 15) was first prescribed fluoxetine for my anxiety and depression at 12, but I never felt like it helped much. I assumed that the coinciding changes in my environment and emotional maturity that comes with getting older were the cause of the shift in my mood. 3 years later, after a brief spell of being unable to eat without uncontrollably vomiting (which we suspected to be a side effect of the Prozac), my doctors switched me to sertraline. It’s known to have a  short half-life and pretty crappy ‘withdrawal’ symptoms (not withdrawal by definition, but that sort of effect). I needed to be careful and diligent in taking it nightly. I did pretty well, but one night I accidentally missed a dose. I had gone to bed, was feeling lazy, and thought ‘missing one night won’t be too bad’. God, was I wrong. I began feeling horrible, anxious, and suicidal. I ended up relapsing after not self harming for months, after telling my friends and family I’d stop for good. It was like I was 12 again. It really gives you a different look on medication. I had never realized just how much SSRIs had improved my life and health, and had this unshakable feeling that I was still the same, unstable, immature little kid that I was years ago, that the facade could drop in an instant. It’s a shameful, demeaning feeling.

23,Should I Quit My Meds?,"I’m stopping all my meds because I’m worried the pharmacist touched my pills and had a stomach bug and I’ll get sick if I take them. So rather than risk a stomach bug, I’m quitting all my meds (2mg Xanax XR, 90mg Duloxetine, 10mg Focalin, 10mg Lexapro) cold turkey. It’s day 7, and I am not having a great time. At all.

My anxiety is through the roof, my OCD a thousand times worse than it was before. Everything is going to make me sick, or so my brain says. I want to eat EVERYTHING after having no appetite for years, which is genuinely kind of uplifting, except I’m too scared to touch anything lest I catch a stomach bug. Minimal food, a few sips of water a day, no pills whatsoever for a week now.

I’m remarkably sensitive to light and sound, and the mood swings are hellish at best. The headaches, dizziness, and sweats have come and gone already. GERD is worse than usual, but I’m managing. Right now my main complaint is that I’m so cold that I think I might die. I’m shivering under a blanket in jeans and a thick sweater. 

I’m mostly just afraid of vomiting from withdrawal. It hasn’t happened yet, but I know it’s common and I am TERRIFIED. I’m doing all this to avoid that, you know? Too scared of vomiting to take my meds that I know help me (to a degree.) Hell, I’m also prescribed Zofran (a medication that prevents vomiting) as needed, but I’m too scared to take it for the same reason I described for stopping all my daily meds.

What’s the likelihood I can make it through this withdrawal period without vomiting? Should I have myself committed so they have to force my pills in me/give via IV, or am I okay to just quit my meds? I know my mental health will suffer off of my meds, but I’m not great on them either. (Obviously, since I’m quitting my meds that I’ve been on for years because I’m too scared of getting sick.) I just don’t want to vomit.

I don’t know what to do. I’m not sure what’s a real concern anymore. I need some guidance, but my roommate is gone for the next five days, and I’m not in a logical state of mind to know what to do.

33,Still a monster wuthout my meds?,"I don't know where to even begin...  
I was always a very nervous, irritated child, I used to throw a lot of tantrums when overstimulated, which I very easily was. Teenage years were hell as well, I was so nervous all the time, had no social cues, stressed a lot about EVERYTHING. I destroyed my room several times due to not being able to regulate my emotions, I was insulting towards my parents, I was depressed, had no friends. We thought it was depression. I tried several meds, it didn't help. Then, at 18, I tried escitalopram. It got better. It was not immediately perfect, but it got waaaaay more manageable. I was more relaxed, happier, I even became more agreeable to be around.

I'm now 29, and for the last 11 years, it kept improving. I have a stable job, a stable boyfriend, we rent a quite small yet relatively cosy apartment. I have few but good friends and I have a good relationship with my family. I discovered I can actually be a joyful, easy going and fun person. Life is good.

Now, my ""problem"" is: my psychiatrist told me when I started to take escitalopram that I might need to take it for my whole life. At the time, I didn't really care, because my life was HELL, so I thought ""whatever it takes"". But now, I'm starting to question myself. I tried to decrease the dosage (with my psychiatrist's approval, of course), but I can't seem to function under 10mg.

And now I'm starting doubting myself: I thought I had progressed so much in life, I had learned how to manage my anxiety and my emotions better, in short, I thought I had finally become a BETTER PERSON, A GOOD PERSON, which I never thought I was before. But as soon as the dosage drops below 10mg, I become a literal monster. I become aggressive again, a nervous wreck, I want to cry and sleep all day, I snap at people for the pettiest reason ever. And I KNOW my psychiatrist told me I might need to take the medication for ever, but I can't help thinking I'm actually not the joyful, easy going and fun person I thought I had become.

At the beginning of last year I had been on a couple prescriptions for a while that had kept me stable. When things got shaky in my personal life my prescriber added Cymbalta to the mix. It was a nightmare, and coming off of it has been extremely traumatic. She prescribed something to help compensate and things only got worse. And now she’s suggesting tapering off of THAT med and switching to something else. 

I’m just so frustrated. Ever since coming off the Cymbalta I just keep hitting new lows. And everything we try to change is just making it worse. I’m no longer looking at a new med as something that could make me feel better; now I am feeling of anxiety and dread as I’m wondering if it will make me even worse.

But after some time being clean and having a better schedule I stopped taking my meds, not really by choise but slowly started skipping them and now I'm off them for a few months and generally feel better, at first it was hard being without the meds and I was lower energy and more depressed but I feel like things have settled.

56,My meds made me more depressed ,"Hi, I've been taking anti psychotics for about a month now, it has helped so much with the rest of my problems and I feel like a much better person in general. 

But now I'm more depressed than ever. Before this, I used to ""entertain"" myself with the paranoias and imaginary problems I made up in my head to cope or distance myself from people. 

Nothing is wrong in my life realistically anymore, I think. 

I live with my partner and we have two amazing cats, I love all of them dearly. I have an okay job and an okay house to live in. Ive always been low maintenance, I don't need much to be satisfied. 

But I've lost interest in everything. Nothing feels like anything anymore. I'm just empty headed, just doing everything for the sake of doing whatever. 

I love drawing, walking, cartoons, some video games, knitting/crocheting, and basically anything that involves manual work and creativity. But I don't feel anything from it anymore. I do it with the same feeling as idk, opening a door, it's all nothing. 

The only thing I seem to be able to feel is love for my partner and the cats, but the way I am now, I'm not much fun for either of them, I'm not a very talkative person but I talk even less now and when I do, I just say some depress d shit which I know upsets my partner, not in a bad way but I know he feels like he should be doing something to help me but he can't and I don't accept much of what he does as an attempt either cause I don't want him worrying about me but I cannot lie or hide how I feel. 

I also lost my appetite completely, I only eat at my partner's request (not the first, he asks multiple times and cooks for me and at that point, I just don't want him to worry or for him to take the time to cook just to waste his efforts) and at work sometimes if I feel that I can't physically go on with my tasks without adding some energy, mostly I just drink tea with more than my usual amount of sugar to keep on. 

I've been at some levels of depression almost all my life but it's getting worse, very similar to how I was when it first started, but back then I had no one and never left my room. 

I really want to get better for my partner, that's the reason why I started taking meds in the first place. 

 I want to make his life better but I'm just an another thing to worry about... I know he doesn't see me as a burden and loves me but I see that it is not fair to him and I don't want this life for him and I know even tho he may not say it, he himself wants a more fun life too.

I have awful memory. This usually doesn't bother me, but I've been skipping my meds as a result. I don't even realize I've skipped them until I look back at the log in my phone's notes that I keep to check and lo and behold, I've somehow gone days without them and completely forgotten. It's weird, all of it seems correct then I just start progressively getting worse at taking them until I've missed an unacceptable amount of days.

I have Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety, it's what the meds are for to begin with which isn't great because I'm actively making myself worse by not taking them. I need to take 2 a day but have been tending to just pass out lately for hours at a time, even on a good sleeping schedule and it's like I just forget they exist.

I've tried notes in my phone, a checklist, texting myself reminders, pretty much anything I can think of and yet I always forget. Does anyone else have this happen and know of a way to make it easier?

65,"Having to go back on Meds, feeling like a failure","I don’t know. The long and the short of it is this posts title I guess. First time poster in this community.

Got diagnosed with Bipolar II, PTSD, and ADHD in early 20’s. Now literally a couple days shy of turning 31. Went off of meds about a year ago (approx) cus husband and I are trying for kids and majority of the meds I was on cause birth defects or pregnancy complications. I’ve been in therapy for approx. 2.5 years now.

So I felt like I had a handle on things, you know? I’ve been off of meds for almost a year (except my daily Zenzedi for my ADHD) and I felt like I had my depressive episodes under control. Like I knew my own signs for when I’m manic. But lately, I just… feel like I’m white-knuckling, if that makes sense? Just pushing myself to get from one hour to the next (let alone trying to get from one day to the next).

I have two work assignments that I’m trying to focus on right now and I could literally wrap them up in about 3-4 hours for each of them. Literally 8 hours of work and I’d be done with them and I could get my boss of my ass. But here I am. On Reddit.

It literally feels like I am climbing Everest with no gear and no knowledge of climbing and I am being pushed to climb Everest anyway. And even this analogy doesn’t feel like it fits quite right cus as I said, I’ve been in therapy for approx 2.5 years now so I have tools and coping techniques that my therapist has gone over with me a million times but I just. can’t. reach. for them.

So I’ve caved now and made an appt with my old psychiatrist to try and go back on some sort of medication but as soon as I got off the phone with the receptionist I felt ***NO*** sense of accomplishment. No sense of, “you did the right thing.” Instead, I am sitting here, ***BERATING*** myself and ***TEARING*** myself apart because I’ve “caved” and “given up” and I “need to go back on my little bitch pills” again. I’m so disgusted with myself and so frustrated with myself because I know ***LOGICALLY*** and *RATIONALLY* that I am doing the right thing and I am reaching out for help because I ***need it*** but that isn’t what my brain is telling me.

I don’t know. I don’t know the point of my post. Maybe I’m just venting? Maybe I need support? Maybe I’m looking for advice? I don’t know. Does anyone else deal with these thoughts and these emotions or am I truly, irreparably broken?

My spouse is a type-1 diabetic and a kidney transplant recipient so he has to take a plethora of meds daily just to stay alive and healthy and I ****NEVER**** have these thoughts about him. In fact, I’m in awe of his tenacity and his will to constantly keep going and I think he’s the strongest person I know. So why do I have these thoughts about myself?

I don’t know. I just feel like… it’s my brain, right? I should be able to control my own thoughts. I should be able to control my thoughts to go take a shower when I need to. To brush my teeth when I need to. To feed myself when I am hungry. To do these two stupid little work tasks that would literally take me 8 fucking hours to do but I just… can’t.

I have been through years of therapy, with different specialists due to moving. Over the years, I have been consistently diagnosed with PTSD and clinical depression. I found it difficult to effectively implement what I was learning in therapy due to persistent low mood, fatigue, etc. Although one very good therapist assessed no ""chemical imbalance""(which has since been in question anyway), I still decided to begin medication to help manage symptoms. It has made a world of difference.

However, many subsequent doctors have been very surprised that I only take 10mlg, which is about midway through the recommended dosage. I am also on the same medication (Lexapro) that I first tried, which is also unusual. I have never experienced adverse symptoms, but do have withdrawals if I run out of medication.

Anyways, unlike many stories you hear of meds I basically feel it hasn’t done anything, good or bad. IF anything, it has made me more fearful cause of all the negative stories I have heard of people on medication. I basically struggle with C-PTSD and high anxiety. I have had a lot of crazy life changes lately and I think that’s why my anxiety has been so high lately and does not have to do much with the meds. Anyways, I no longer have health insurance and cancelled with my psychiatrist and haven’t heard back to reschedule and I’m just thinking like… I am spending so much money for seeing a psychiatrist and getting these meds that I feel don’t do anything at all. I feel if I better my habits and stay with my therapist I could possibly have the same improvements as if the meds are working. Is it bad to slowly start taking less of my meds a day, like 75 to 50, 50 to 25. Im currently taking a pill and a half a day for 75mg and I have quite a bit left and was wondering if over a few weeks I can slowly stop taking them. I know I could just stop but I think I’ll psych myself out and convince myself I’m going crazy, and I’m sure it’s recommended to not just abruptly stop. Should I suck up the money issues and see if I can change my meds and keep trying? I have just heard such scary things about medication messing people up… I’m a fully functional person I just have moods of depression and some panic attacks.

85,Everyone thinks I’m not sick enough for anti anxiety meds. ,"To preface this, I work in a very dangerous job— I work for the state in taking care of my low functioning autistic brother. He is violent and on and off antipsychotics. He has catatonia which can get him very agitated and attack with mostly biting, grappling, always going for the face. He is 24 and 220 lbs so it is terrifying and painful every time he attacks.

The rest of my family say they cannot deal with the stress of my brother, so 90% of his care falls onto me, and the random college kid they hire to take care of him when I can’t (and don’t disclose his tendencies). They are each on klonopin, including my brother, mom, dad, and almost every immediate family. My brother is 24/7 supervision. I can’t just clock out.

I’m constantly emotionally monitoring and checking his facial expressions more than anything in the world. I hide and hide and hide. I’m not having a panic attack most the time, because I’ve done lots of therapy to emotional regulate, but I can feel the strain it’s putting on my heart. I’m in constant fear and I have no one to help me, but I can’t leave him. The last caregiver was neglectful and my parents turned a blind eye because they’re too afraid to be around him.

86,Anxiety management without meds,"What is everyone doing to help them survive debilitating anxiety? 

I’ve struggled with health and generalized anxiety/depression/panic attacks since my mom passed in 2013. It’s always been every now and then and never lingered. 
This year my boyfriend and I moved to a new city which triggered the most intense depression I’ve had since losing my mom. The depression lifted for the most part after a month or so but then my anxiety started to flare really bad. I have multiple panic attacks a week for the first time in forever and they are more intense than they’ve ever been. 

Before it always seemed like it was just a temporary thing I could fix and after not having any anxiety for a couple years I thought I had but lately I’ve been spiraling thinking that this must be how people reach the point where they consider suicide. I don’t want to die but sometimes it seems so frightening to be alive. My anxiety definitely manifests as physical symptoms and makes me ill. 

I’ve been taking 500mg magnesium glycinate with d3 everyday for about a month and that seemed to be working well but I just had another panic attack and I just feel exhausted and miss feeling like myself. 

Even when I am feeling “normal” I still have such a weird melancholy sensation where it feels like nothing is quite real and I’ll never feel real happiness again. 

I know I should be telling all this to a therapist but 
1. I have no money
2. I don’t want to go on medication because I’ve heard coming off of it is terrifying 

I do my best to eat healthy, drink water, avoid alcohol, stay active which is so discouraging because it feels like nothing helps much. 

My boyfriend has never experienced anxiety or depression so as much as he wants to help I think his inability to relate makes it difficult. And I’m not even sure what he could do. My dad also passed away so it’s just me and my two siblings as far as family but they suffer with their own mental health too.

91,Is it OK to be glad your on meds? ,"Hello all
Warning: 
This is partly a vent and slight mentions of self harm. Can't put more then one warning on. 


I have panic disorder and depression. 
For years I suffered numbness and attacks. No matter what I did. No matter the excises, the breathing techniques, the therapy sessions, the venting it did not stop me from having at minimum 2-3 attacks a day. Once I finally got medicated and got the correct dose I felt amazing. It was like a cloud was lifted. Same thing happened with the depression.the constent dread, constent holding back on ending it all. I feel happier. I do get the odd overload/overwhelming day but it's not everyday or preventing me from doing things. The problem comes to family and many online/offline poeple telling me meds are bad, addictive, dangerous and its better to be off them. I understand it's not for everyone but it is for me. I have been told multiple times of how great it was to not relay on meds or that your selling your soul to doctors. I have had my fair share of bad doctors but can't I be happy with were I am at. Can't I just be happy to not have to worry about having an attack 24/7?

103,I don’t want to be on meds,"I have been on antidepressants for almost all of my teenage life. I started taking them at the beginning of the pandemic because I was unmotivated and anxious. Four years later, looking back with the circumstances at hand, not being motivated or being anxious was a really normal response to what was going on in the world. But my doctor, who is now a convicted sex offender, convinced my mother to put me on meds. It was all downhill from there. My self-harm got significantly worse, I lost my empathy, I was a shell of the person I was. I switched medications after 2 years of the doctor slowly increasing my dose. 

When I started a new medication my doctor told me to go off my current high dose that I’d been in for years cold turkey. Of course, it is very well known that going straight off of the medication I was on is a terrible idea. I was lucky in only getting so sick I could barely eat for two months. I was lucky for not having seizures, or even dying. The meds he put me on made me heavily suicidal. I have stated that I wanted to at least try and go unmedicated for a bit just to see how my brain was, but he instead kept giving me more drugs. 

After a few months of slowly getting worse again, I of course want to go off my meds but every time I speak to a doctor about doing so they end up raising my dose. I don’t know what to do.

105,"A bit of a vent, but also a PSA for those on meds, or starting meds","TLDR: for those who don't want to read the vent portion, the moral is that medication can be extremely, extremely helpful, but you *need* to take it consistently/ how you're prescribed it. More importantly than that, try your damndest to get refills several days before it runs out at least, and do *not* go cold-turkey, especially on SSRIs. The side-effects from suddenly cutting off can be very rough.


So, context: 27M, had severe anxiety and depression since my mid-late teens, later diagnosed with ADHD in early 20s. Been on various meds since age 20 (mainly SSRIs, also adderall).

I started taking Trintellix about a year and half ago, I believe. It worked better for me than any SSRI I'd previously been on, and I've actually been consistently taking it daily for the majority of the time I've been on it. Now, my local pharmacy has had multiple stock issues over the past few months (Walgreens, if anyone's curious, and its multiple locations around me), and I was told at my last consistent refill attempt, that they wouldn't get more of my med in until several days after I would run out. Fine, whatever, I can last a few days. Well, I also happened to run out of my adderall during this time. The result: motivation/ energy plummeted, and I put off refilling either for far too long. I did get an adderall refill about a week later, but forgot to do the Trintellix. End result: I went probably over 3 weeks without my antidepressant/ anti-anxiety.

And god, I wish I refilled sooner. I literally, from the day I stopped, have felt the life and emotion drain out of me like a melting glacier. All the optimism, energy, enthusiasm I had before, largely gone right now. I'm finally getting my refill tomorrow.

2. I was only able to think about life outside the hospital when a family member called and visited.

My Concerta stopped working in April, so we tried Biphentin for my ADHD, which didn't work, so I switched to dexedrine, it doesn't have many side effects, but I still don't feel motivated enough, so they hightened the dose of that one as well, and it seems to work, but I still don't feel as concentrated as I used to and I am constantly bored still. It ruined my grades in the second semester and I miss being a good student. Winter is coming and It will likely make me feel worse as I live in Canada and we get less sunlight. When I first tried to find the right medication for ADHD, it took 4 years with a lot of trial and error to find one that actually worked, and didn't have terrible side effects. I don't want to go through all that again, because I'm in the middle of high school and I actually want to succeed this year, like how I used to. I don't want to lose my teen years to some stupid medication! I feel like a bloody lab rat! I will keep on hoping that the next thing that the doctor suggests will actually work this time.

119,How do I know if I’m getting worse? Should I consider meds?,"I’m currently 18 and my mental health began to deteriorate my freshmen year of highschool after COVID hit. I’ve always struggled with the feeling of always being tense or overstimulated but during this time period I became incredibly depressed in addition to being anxious all the time. I unintentionally drifted away from my friends and family, stopped eating, and was in and out of therapy. I was never officially diagnosed but my therapist at the time said that I exhibit behaviors that relate to depression and generalized anxiety, and had suggested that I look into being medicated. When I heard this, I felt inclined to stop going to therapy because not only did I not want to believe that something was wrong with me but my family was extremely concerned for me during that point in my life. Since then, I have tried to pretend that I never went through that dark phase in my life. However, I can’t help but notice how different I am from my peers or kids my age in general. 

I’ve always been a shy and sensitive kid (probably where my anxiety roots from) but in recent years I’ve noticed that I can’t feel anymore. When I’m around other people, I find it tiring to communicate with them because it almost feels as though I’m floating away from them as they are speaking to me. If they make a joke or say something kind to me, I’ll manage a weak smile, but emotionally I feel nothing. But there are also times where I feel the exact opposite - like my mind is thinking too much and it feels as though it could burst. There are days where I freak myself out so much about everything and anything that I just start excessively sweating and get nauseous. 

It’s become very tiring to live like this. But my parents aren’t the most understand people when it comes to mental health. Should I still consider medication?

132,PLEASE HELP!!! sleep anxiety and psych meds,"I KNOW THIS IS LONG BUT PLEASE READ IF YOU HAVE INSIGHT ON SLEEP ISSUES, PSYCH MEDS, AND MENTAL HEALTH/NEURODIVERGENCE 

Context:
I have ADHD, OCD, anxiety/depression, c-ptsd, and autism. Because of this, falling asleep and going back to sleep is hard because of racing thoughts, sensory issues, etc. 

I have been on 20+ psych meds, a lot of which have made issues worse for me. Some of ""masked"" my sleep issues which makes it harder to sleep off them, and some caused vivid/excessive dreaming. (more on this later*) This is what really started to fuel my sleep anxiety/fear. The only constant on that I've been on is Adderall (a few months ago I switched from IR to XR for my afternoon “booster”) 

More recently: 
A few weeks ago, I went off of Zyprexa (I have been on it and other similar drugs before but keep going off bc horrible side effects, but then start again bc I can’t fall asleep), quit THC completely, and started Buspar (3x daily). My life has been hell ever since. 

Over the past few weeks, my nights have looked like this: I have a ton of trouble falling asleep, but do eventually. Anywhere from a few minutes to an hour later, I’ll wake up. Then  I’ll like, kinda be asleep but feel awake and am having racing thoughts and anxiety in general the whole time. I start waking up over and over every few minutes and falling back “asleep” into this state until eventually I’m too anxious and I’m wide awake. 

I’ll often take a Xanax/Ativan (been prescribed them “as needed” for about a month and a half now) after and sometimes it helps, but it’s becoming less effective; I’m still anxious, and by the time I take it I’ve already suffered and still only get a few hours of sleep. I’ve taken them before bed and again sometimes it helps, but it’s not a good daily option, but my “as needed” keeps getting more frequent thought

I’ve tried OTC sleep meds but they haven’t worked for more than one night. So, about a week ago I started Hydroxyzine, and it makes me physically tired at first, but I still have the same problems as mentioned above. My body is doing everything in it’s power for me not to sleep. Since starting Hydroxyzine, my dreams have 100x longer/more vivid/more realistic too. 

*More on the dreams: These dreams felt/feel like they happen in real time and I’m not actually sleeping because of how vivid they are. I remember every single thing about them, just like they’re movies. They’re triggering, distressing, and exhausting. I wake up from them too. 

I’ve been doing all of the recommended “sleep hygiene” things (warm bath, listening to podcast/meditation, no social media before bed, etc.) but nothing seems to help. My brain is too loud and too powerful. My therapist feels hopeless/stuck, my psychiatrist feels hopeless/stuck, and I feel hopeless/stuck. 

I’m stuck in a cycle where I’m so anxious about sleeping that my body won’t sleep, not matter how tired it is, which just makes me more anxious. Every night is torture and it gets harder and harder to sleep every night.

I’m looking for any advice that could help me. I don’t know what to do and I’m so tired. I just want to be knocked out.",1696977948.0,False,2,3,concertgoer69,None,174yiwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/174yiwg/please_help_sleep_anxiety_and_psych_meds/
133,"Wife is getting worse, refuses meds","So the wife 45(f) and I(51m) have been dealing with a lot of her mental health issues over the past 2 years (pretty much right after we got married) that are out of control. Things are so bad right now that we are separated because she started accusing me of spying on her and tracking her to see where she was. She is in therapy (ptsd and anxiety diagnosed so far) but there is a family history of bipolar and schizophrenia. We fight often, sometimes over little things sometimes more important topics. 

The one thing that keeps happening is during the fights she brings up every little thing I've done in the past (no cheating or abuse) and remembers what happened almost word for word. Things like remember 5 years ago when I asked you to bring up the laundry and you didn't or I may have said something that seemed innocent but she will fire it off later in a fight because it hurt her feelings. She doesn't just do this with me, she still yells at her brother about him breaking her bike when they were kids.

I guess what I getting at is...I don't think this is normal or healthy I said she may want to mention that to her therapist. Also since she started therapy at the beginning of the year she seems to be getting worse. 
Yesterday I mentioned that maybe she should ask the therapist about meds(she has been going at it med free so far). Holy shit that started the fight or all fights and she told me maybe you need to take meds. She deflects a lot if she doesn't have an answer for something I said. 

I love my wife, before all this started she was great we never had any major problems just the usual minor things that pop up. I am trying to be here for her but all she does is accuse me of just wanting to be in her business or keep her locked in the house. Tells me I don't really care about her and I hate her. Our kids ( 3 teenagers) have all given up on her.

My bf and I are in our 30’s, and have been dating for almost 2 years. 

He is on 4-5 meds for anxiety. I am on meds for bipolar, so I understand the struggle. His sex drive is gone. He isn’t affectionate anymore. We also believe he is on the spectrum. He acts so put off by physical touch. Getting him to kiss me is so difficult. I feel so rejected. 

He claims I can ask for sex whenever; but the passion is gone. I think him being on the spectrum makes him fall to realize that things need to change. He has said “sex isn’t our entire relationship.” Which is true, but also kinda sucks. 

I feel like between mental health meds stealing his sex drive, and autism making him avoid touching me…I’m at a loss. I feel like we drifting apart; and it’s making me so depressed.

143,Personal experience on certain meds? (Trying something new…),"Hi - I’m looking to hear from other people with similar diagnoses and how meds worked for you. I’m working with my teams and under their supervision, so not asking for med advice… I’d just really like to know if others have found similar combos helpful.

Relevant background: 
Psych includes history of ED and SH (about a decade in recovery) MDD, generalized anxiety, DID. 
Neurodivergence: ADHD (was dx’d “Asperger’s” about 9 years ago but hasn’t been updated, and I think the sensory/social/exec. dysfunction is being managed the same it would with an updated ASD dx. 
Chronic illnesses: EDS, Mast Cell Activation, Gastroparesis, POTS, Narcolepsy 

I was misdiagnosed bipolar for a long time, due to then-undiagnosed ADHD and sensory meltdowns. I was then misdiagnosed as BPD several years, which I’ve since learned is quite common for teens with DID. So I was on really inappropriate, very excessive med cocktails for basically all of my teen years that I think made things a lot worse. 

I’ve been on (quite literally) every SSRI there is and react terribly to them. Been on a couple SNRIs and no real improvement. The most effective regimen I was on was Topamax + Klonopin, Topamax off label for mood stabilization. It worked great for about 3 years, and then it made things way worse. 

Currently on a few meds for my chronic illnesses, mostly nausea and gastro mobility meds. I’m on Adderall for the narcolepsy and ADHD which has made a huge difference to how I function, and on Klonopin for the anxiety.  

Currently I’m in some pretty intense trauma therapy, working on DID and general trauma stuff. Now that my sleep is more regulated, it’s become very obvious how depressed I am. My biggest struggle is that I am able to start my days, get some things done, run my feeds and saline, take meds on time, etc. for a few days. And then I’ll miss a dose, or oversleep into the afternoon, and that’ll quickly spiral into feeling as if I’ve failed and can never catch up, and I become totally withdrawn and depressed for another few days. It’s one step forward, one step back, every single week, and it’s so deeply frustrating to plateau like this. 

I feel like I need something to help my depression not spiral so quickly, because half my week being good and half being non-functional is getting ridiculous. I can feel that depression spiral start, but I am unable to stop it. 

Recently my teams have decided Depakote off-label for depression (and anxiety) would be worth a try, mainly because I didn’t have a strong reaction either way when I was on it as a teen, and it’s supposedly a great option for some people who have treatment-resistant depression. 

I’m all for trying it, but I don’t fully understand the differences between what it does to dopamine and what Adderall does to dopamine. The Adderall helps my depression, but idk if it’s due to the confidence boost of feeling like I can initiate and execute tasks better or if it’s the dopamine response, or both. I don’t want to take something that might mess with the marginal improvements, or that would make me so drowsy it’s not worth it with narcolepsy. 

But I have to try something. I can’t keep doing this. I’m in such an incredibly frustrating cycle, I don’t feel like I’m improving at all. And I need to be more functional… I need to make some pretty big life changes soon. Moving out and working part-time, finding a class or hobby or both. Things have been stagnant for so long it feels like years of Groundhog Day. 

I’d really appreciate any advice from people with similar dx/med experiences. I know it’s illogical to feel like I’m the only one experiencing this, but it’s hard not to sometimes. 

TL;DR: I have several chronic illnesses including narcolepsy, ADHD, and my current biggest mental health issues are DID, anxiety, and treatment-resistant depression. I respond badly to SSRIs, Topamax off label was the most effective med I was on but it stopped working. Adderall has helped the narcolepsy + ADHD + depression, Klonopin has been stable for the anxiety, but I’m in a constant cycle of a few good days/a few awful days that feels inescapable. Depakote was recommended to start off-label for MDD/anxiety, I’m just a bit worried about how it’ll affect dopamine/how the Adderall works, and if the drowsiness + narcolepsy will be too much. But I need to try something. 
(I believe 250mg at night is what the first week should be. I’m open to trying it. Just cautious, because I don’t know how I’d manage it making me worse.) 

(Please don’t tell me the meds I’m currently on are bad, I know the side effects, this is what’s the most helpful for me, by far, in a very long time. Functionality is first, I’ll mitigate side effects once that part is managed.)

Thanks so much for anyone who read this. 
First time posting here so I hope I didn’t miss any of the guidelines or rules. I’d very much appreciate any input/personal experience.

146,Husband refuses to go on meds to help with his depression/bipolar II. Need advice. ,"Forgive the long post, we’re out of answers and need advice. 

My husband (38) and I (32) have been together for 9 years, married for 2. He has battled depression since he was ~12 years old and has expressed to me over the years we’ve been together that he’s always has always had some level of suicidal thoughts but has never acted on it. 

Over the last 8 months he’s been in an extremely dark place. He had to leave a job that he loved and ended up getting another one that totally broke him (toxic boss and work environment) until he quit. The last 4 months has been full of panic attacks, severe depression and mentions of suicide (but never “how”). He tried medication for one week, but didn’t like that it made him tired and have no energy, so he threw away the pills. He’s been going to therapy for about 8 years, and has seen a psychiatrist that believes he has bipolar II. 

He keeps saying he’s scared, and that it’s unfair to me that he can’t be happy. He’s severely depressed, can hardly get out of bed, cries almost everyday. He’s mentioned not wanting to live/not wanting to be here more frequently. 

I’m in no way considering leaving him, I love him endlessly, but I need him to consider medication. He’ll take a Xanax when it’s really bad but it knocks him out only to wake up to the same feelings. He keeps saying he doesn’t know what to do, that he can’t live like this but also refuses to try meds again.

Eventually I was diagnosed with PCOS and ADHD on top of the depression and anxiety. Doctors also wondered if I was bipolar or had borderline personality disorder.

163,Is it worth continuing to try to find the right meds?,"I just need to vent.

&#x200B;

Right now I just feel so beaten down, exhausted, and hopeless about my medical future.

My whole life I have struggled with my mental health in a number of ways, but I'll start in 2021 when I started therapy again after a break for depression and anxiety. Did that for a year, no improvement, so I saw a psychiatrist in Dec 2022 primarily for anxiety. I also got on the waiting list to be tested for ADHD.

She started me on buspirone- it made me cry every day on the floor. At this point, I had my ADHD test and they ruled that although I have every symptom of ADHD, I am in the top 1% of intelligence and because of my high intelligence I was diagnosed with ""low tolerance for boredom."" Wtf even is that. At this point, my psychiatrist switched me to Zoloft for the anxiety. 25mg worked well for me and made me feel good, but after going up to 50mg I had a lot of intrusive suicidal thoughts for about 2 weeks. I finally felt like I was adjusting to the med. At this point, I had my weekly therapy session where I happened to speak really fast and talk about the shopping spree I went on that weekend (this is somewhat normal for me, I have compulsively shopped a lot my whole life but it has never been financially disruptive since I earn a lot of money). Because of the shopping and fast talking (another train I have done my whole life) she told me I was manic. I pushed back- I was sleeping fine, I didnt feel elated in any way, I wasnt unsafe in any way. Honestly my mood felt like a 6/10 that day but she told my psychiatrist that I was manic. Because of this, my psych took me off of Zoloft and put me on an antipsychotic (Latuda / lurasidone).

This made me feel horrible. I didnt have anxiety anymore, but I also didnt have any thoughts or a personality. My mood stayed between a 40-60% all the time. I didnt feel joy or motivation ever. I asked to come off and they wouldnt let me because of the chance I could possibly be bipolar (even though I didnt meet clinical qualification for bipolar). At this time I felt really hopeless and had daily suicidal thoguhts so I started an IOP program. In this program, I got to see a different psych who transitioned me onto Lamical/lamotrigine and I got off of the latuda which helped bring my mood to a more normal place for me. I felt more like myself and generally stable. My anxiety was back but I didnt really care because at least I wasnt depressed. While in this program, my IOP therapist and OP therapist met to discuss me, and came back that they thought I had Borderline. I asked them to explain why, and they literally couldnt. I could see on their face that they didnt even believe this diagnosis, but it was all they could offer. Right after this, my therapist left me so I started searching for a new one.

During the intake for a new therapist, I explained all of this. She screened me for borderline and said I only met 2/9 criteria so that didnt make sense. She said she thinks I have ADHD (I'm thinking yes, finally sees!). Because of this, she talked to my new psych and they put me on ADHD meds. First I tried Vyvanse and it was like my world changed- I could finally read 1 full page of a book for the first time in my life in a single sitting. But it made me fall asleep the whole day on it, so then we tried Ritalin, which was fantastic. Worked perfectly and I felt productive, organized, calm, and present. At this point, I got discharged from IOP and back with my OP psychiatrist.

Then I started getting energy crashes so I switched to Concerta. Bring on the brain fog, inability to focus, and unproductiveness. I have had some god days and some bad days on it. Until this week where every day has been anhedonic and apathetic. I had a breakdown friday night and had to text the crisis hotline.

I am exhausted. I'm tired of trying meds and still feeling like shit. Right now I have no motivation, nothing brings me joy, I am canceling all my plans with friends, I can't do anything except play sudoku and count down until I can try and go to sleep.

This whole experience has brought me to a point where I feel like nothing is going to work. I finally was in a good place and then it all went to shit this week. Part of me just wants to scrap all my meds and go back to just being anxious. Anhedonia is killing me and I don't know what is causing it.

I am lucky enough to live in the city, but authorities around me would not take me seriously even if they're good people. I have been struggling in college because of my inability to focus and anxiety attacks. I also get triggered and overwhelmed easily. I end up avoiding my tasks and procrastinating a lot because of it, and it worries me because finals are coming up and I don't have the privilege to fail my classes for this semester. I had breakdowns of this possibility, and there's a huge chance I'll enter a depressive phase if it happens.

I have always had these problems as I was growing up, but I just let it slide. They're getting worse tho, to the point I get so distressed and can't just ignore them anymore.

168,Getting off all psychiatric meds and feeling really good,"I was on the anti-psychotic medication Latuda from 2017 to 2021. I had been diagnosed with BPD which I now no longer agree with that diagnosis at all as it made no sense. Most of the ""BPD symptoms"" started after being put on Latuda while also starting the Depo-Provera shot and then switching to an IUD and then the pill within a few months of each other. I was also put on to Venlafaxine and Lithium prior to the diagnosis and Latuda. My family doctor put me on those as she thought I was bipolar with no good reason for her thought process. Mind you, my chief complaints were anxiety and OCD-like symptoms. I came out with a cocktail of high dose medications and a BPD diagnosis. The psychiatrist even said I didn't need to be on Lithium but didn't take me off of it for another year. 

Anyway, I started to do research on autism last year and really felt like it explained my lived experience. I talked to a psychologist about it who agreed with that diagnosis. I wanted off all of my medications. I had already started with getting off the Latuda in 2021. I felt like it was the reason I was having vivid dreams and nightmares. After talking to the psychologist, I wanted off of the Venlafaxine too. This was the worst experience of my entire life. That drug is the worst thing ever to come off of and it took months but I finally did it. 

I was finally off of everything by the beginning of this year. All I was taking was my birth control pill and a heartburn medication. I had gained 100 lbs though from being on all of these meds for so long so I did agree to go on Ozempic in which I have now lost 51lbs. 

It is actually mind boggling of how much better my life is now that I am off every psychiatric drug. My mind is so clear and I am so much happier. I didn't realize just how unhappy those medications were making me feel until they weren't inside me anymore. I only now just have to lose the rest of the weight that I had gained as gaining 100 lbs in 6 years led to me developing sleep apnea as well as just being in pain and out of breath al the time. 

I do believe though that I developed tardive dyskinesia from the long term Latuda use. My eyes and mouth twitch a lot, but it is my hands and feet that are driving me nuts. I actually had an EMG test done because I thought maybe I had carpal tunnel but they found nothing. My family doctor told me it was just a ""stress tic"" without even considering the long term anti-psychotic use but this is also the same person who once told me I was bipolar without ever having a manic or depressive episode.

169,The irony of anxiety meds,"I started seeing a new psych for the first time in like two years. And he's really chill and warm. Cool dude, this isn't about him. I'm just feeling some kind of irony(?) About taking medication that has intense possible side effects that are meant to help with anxiety and mood. When the warnings give me anxiety lol. Just a weird little feeling of exasperation, resignation, acceptance, disbelief, and whatever the word for laughing at yourself is.

Im starting prozac and lamictal for my intense anxiety and bipolar disorder. But I am also a person who has stress headaches/migraines bc God had to nerf me somehow. And when reading the warnings it mentioned mixing the meds with NSAIDs raises the risk of a bleed in my stomach..... Which was not something I wanted to read about. There's also the possibility of developing a (sometimes fatal) rash on the lamictal. 

I already talked to the pharmacist about it. She gave me good advice about taking the meds with food to lower the risk of a bleed. But dang partner. That sure still makes me mighty nervous.",1687046312.0,False,2,1,A_Good_Boy24601,None,14c5r7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/14c5r7a/the_irony_of_anxiety_meds/
170,Scared of Meds and if I really need them?,"I'm passing through what I believe is a situational depression. My ex broke up with me 8 months ago. I have a feeling of guilt due to my emotional immaturity. I feel like I won't find anyone like her.. I feel like I screwed up beyond repair and that my one chance at true happiness is lost.

I'm 33M. I've been going to therapy, working out, traveling, trying new hobbies, new art classes, meeting friends and family regularly... but I feel like I'm stuck again. I had a few days of happiness when I was abroad some weeks ago, but I'm back to crying again. I hadn't cried in over 1/2 months, but it's back to me missing her. 

My Psychiatrist had prescribed anti-depressants 2 months ago, but I decided to give it a go without them. I hear so many stories about depressed ppl not being able to sleep, go out, enjoy moments. I can now sleep throughout the night, just find it hard to get up in the morning, I'm fine with socializing on most days (although not all), and I feel that I can push myself to enjoy certain moments and events.   
So I somehow felt that I got it ""easy"". But it's tiring. Should I keep on pushing without the anti-depressants?

I struggle to function properly during work, I get anxious without my phone and I find almost every excuse to procrastinate. I feel a bit fatigued most of the time too. I feel like I just exist. I wouldn't hurt myself, but I honestly don't think I would mind not existing anymore. I'm definitely not suicidal though.

172,Confused on med stuff,"So, I've been in therapy now for three years and on and off various meds for quite some time!

My official diagnosis as of today are: Bipolar (unspecified), PTSD, GAD, and now ADHD.

I am currently taking: 20 mg of Lexapro (which helps me immensely), 100 mg of Trazadone (which helps me a lot too), 10 mg of Buspirone (which helps quite a bit), and new to this is 30 mg of Vyvanse (I've only been on it 2 days).

I was diagnosed with ADHD in grade school. Ritalin helped me more than any medication I have ever taken. I recently had to change psychiatrists and she rediagnosed me with it two days ago. I was extremely excited at the time because I'm getting help!

My therapist of two years saw my diagnosis and said she disagreed. She thinks I have PTSD severe enough it manifests as looking like ADHD. I don't know now, is she right? I figured she might be, but idk. Is my new psychiatrist wrong? She fixed my meds as soon as I started seeing her and upped my Lexapro and the wffects were immediate. 

I've only been on vyvanse two days and so far it hasn't affected me at all. I get a little tired when I take it but that's about it. Mood stabilizers truthfully have done little to nothing to help me.

174,"Need emergency (fast acting) psych meds, super depressed, can't do illegal drugs(urine testing).","Try to keep as short as possible.

Male 36years old, 8 years prison, lifelong drug addict, on no meds (been 1 year off anti-depressants and everything).I've been more depressed than I ever have in my entire life. I have been clean from drugs for 1 year. Just got my CDL, should be working but Ive been ""on call"" after training for several weeks. Just moved back home. Home is in a remote part of the mountains in Crestline, CA. Have no car, live with deaf 88y/o grandfather. I have never been suicidal, but I'm getting close (I always just use drugs). I wish I were working, I feel like an unwanted guest in my home, my family hates me cuz I moved back with Grandpa, so my ex-wife and 5year old daughter that were living with him moved out. So my family blames me on why grandpa doesn't see my daughter. I wish they were both here, It's lonely living here I have no friends, my family makes me feel like I'm unwanted and blames me for GPA not seeing my daughter. It's like it would be better if I was dead, my family would be happier without me. Except grandpa and my daughter, they love me. 

Haven't showered in days, don't even want to get out of bed, have no reason to anyway. Wish I was working (not at home basically alone middle of nowhere with no one to talk to no friends almost no family at least to talk to). I don't have a car so I'm stuck here in the middle of nowhere. I have no reason to get out of bed, and it takes me 2 hours everyday to get out of bed. If I were to smoke some meth I would feel great again, have motivation to get out of bed and get shit done. I can't do illegal drugs because of my job. I have been obsessing about legal (semilegal) research chemicals that I could do and still pass drug tests. 3mmc, 2cmc, etc. but  I wish I had ordered them online weeks ago, what's stoping me is I know they are addictive af and have to wait long shipping times. I'm this close to sneaking out (basically escaping remember no car middle of nowhere house) to get some meth. At this point the risk is worth it, I have no reason for being, can bearely get out of bed.

I am going to dr tomorrow, going to ask for gabapentin because usually I take a few and I have energy, mood uplift, and motivation to get shit done. I'm going to ask for advice as to what psych med would be best for me and my situation. Obviously I need therapy and anti-depressants (which don't start working for 4 weeks). That takes lots of time to work. I need something that works instantly to lift my mood, depression, energy. I know taking legal reasearch chemicals isn't the answer, but for me it seems the best answer (it is), the time to delivery is alll that's stopped me. So, what kinds of medications should I be seeking from a psychiatrist? I don't plan on using drugs while working (driving), but until I have a reason to be alive (working), I need something to fill in the deep emptyness in my heart and severely missing chemicals in my brain. Gabapentin is the only thing I know of that I could see them ACTUALLY prescribing me and working somewhat. Can I ask for stimulants? How do I ask without sounding like I'm drug seeking (which I pretty much am, well, seeking an escape from depression that drugs have always given me for 20+ years.)

I'm doing so well right now if I was working, yet this being basically unemployed, alone, hated by most of my family, alone, has me so down. I'm drinking right now, Goddamn I hate alcohol but I need an escape. If there was a local store to buy cathinones or other stimulants besides caffeine I would love that. I still love my exwife but even now she wants nothing to do with me obviously or she would still be living here at grandpas and I would be so happy to be with my daughter.

I'm only looking for what to ask the doctor for and how, or some kind of chemical and/or stimulant that I can buy in store somewhere like at a GNC or something. I don't have 2 weeks to wait for research chemicals online, I'll be on meth long before then, and I'm trying to not do illegal drugs so I can keep my job and pass a drug test mostly. Thank you for your time, think of it as harm reduction on me and my life. Prison and homelessness seem better than this (friends and no depression), so I just need a mood lift until I start working again. Until I have a reason and purpose, again.

177,What were the meds even doing?,"I'm hoping this is an ok place to post this because I'm just so confused. I thought I understood how medicine worked but I guess I don't.

About 2 years ago I went to see a GP for life insurance purposes, they needed to confirm I didn't have something wrong with me before increasing my life insurance. I didn't have a GP so I went to a new one who was nice and helpful and everything but in our first meeting, like within MINUTES of meeting me, she diagnosed me with anxiety/depression and put me on 10 mg of Citalopram which I understand to be a pretty low dosage. At the time I was having some really intense anxiety attacks related to my job and situation. 

At one point in the 2 years I increased my dosage to 20 mg because I felt like the 10 mg wasn't working as well anymore. I also changed jobs and some aspects of my personal life to bring me more peace. She increased it and I was taking 20 for like 5 months or so and then last month, through a series of blunders, I missed my doctors appointment and ran out of refills, so I stopped taking the 20 mg of Citalopram completely cold turkey and... it's been a month or so since I've stopped taking it and I feel actually no tangible difference in mood whatsoever. Like you could have told me they were sugar pills and I would have believed you in hindsight. 

I stopped going to that doctor because outside of the life insurance thing and needing to see her every quarter for a refill of the pills, I had no reason to be there, so I can't ask her about this and I kind of don't want to because I now don't think I needed them at all, so how can I trust what she says?

It can be severe but is usually under control.  Hasn’t affected my career (much at least) or either marriage.  

I’ve been with my psych for about 3 years.   We have never met face to face or even done FaceTime.  I don’t like that but I’m just the patient.  We talk on the phone every few months and she renews my longstanding Rxs, minus some discussions.  

I have Medicare now and I have supplemental.  It should be covered 100%. Her billing person thinks I owe hundreds, the doctor mentions it and I explain I’m trying to work through it with billing.  I’m on social security and can’t write a check for hundreds I don’t owe. Anyway my Rxs ran out.

192,Long overdue doctors appointment and new meds,"Been putting it off for too long, been off my last meds a few months and really struggling with OCD, depression, and GAD. I stopped the last medication (escitalopram) because although out of all the meds I've been on (tried 6, 7 if you count the new one - mostly SSRIs but also a tricyclic, a tetracyclic, and the new one being an SNRI) it's been the most helpful long term, it had become less effective. I tried taking mirtazapine alongside it, but the drowsiness was too much and I was frequently oversleeping. When I stopped taking the escitalopram, I also realised it had been causing another problem - I find it really embarrassing, but for years I've had issues with bladder control - before escitalopram, but I've been on other SSRIs for years. I stopped taking escitalopram and I don't wet myself any more (sorry TMI I know). I unintentionally came across something about how SSRIs can cause incontinence around this time. I now believe that's what this was (previously suspected bladder damage from holding it when OCD was particularly bad years back which I'm not ruling out as playing a part)

Anyway I had my appointment yesterday. The doctor was very lovely but she did seem like the sort that wasn't keen to prescribe. I forced myself to be brave and mention the SSRI incontinence hence not wanting to go on an SSRI. She kept talking about counselling and I was honest with her; I told her that it won't work for me because I really struggle to be honest face to face and I'd struggle to fit in appointments around work. I said truthfully that if I had all the money in the world I'd do online counselling where I can just message a counsellor etc. She was understanding, I said I'll look at the online info of a company she recommended mostly just to appease her but I don't expect to find any CBT info I didn't already know, I've spent about half my life struggling with mental health and engaging in online communities and I KNOW the coping strategies. I told her that my brain just doesn't work the way it's meant to and medication is the only thing that's really helped in the past. I strongly believe if my brain is unable to make certain chemicals, there's no shame in taking medication to make it do that. At one point she made a laughing (with me not at me) comment about how I really want the medication/am really set on the medication, aren't I? Or similar. I said yes but made it clear I understand it's not all about medication, I think I said I just need something to help give me that push. She suggested at some point going back on escitalopram and I flat out said no (which is big for me, I find it really hard to just say no) - I felt a bit annoyed that she was suggesting me going back on something that was making me wet myself. I felt like we were going round in circles for a while with her trying to avoid giving me anything new - it was only when I mentioned to her that when I spoke to someone previously (I'd wanted to up dosage of escitalopram but hadn't realised I was at max dose, that was when I went on mirtazapine alongside it), they said there were other things they could try if I came off the escitalopram, that she said we could try venlafaxine, so I was happy with that. I figure it's what I wanted - not an SSRI, something new. When she said about going back on the escitalopram I said I need to feel like I'm moving forward not back or something. I didn't think of suggesting trying the mirtazapine on its own as it's a tetracyclic not SSRI and it did help me alongside the escitalopram - perhaps I wouldn't have been so drowsy if it were just that without the escitalopram too? Doesn't look like she thought of that either though which seems silly as I mentioned the combo helped but I was too tired. Says a lot to me about her unwillingness to think about meds when she was set on counselling or going back on something I'd already tried. I liked her but not keen on the impression I got on her attitude to medication - I believe people sometimes have to try a lot of meds to get the right one/combination. Honestly I feel like the reason she wasn't so keen on meds and was mentioning older ones having more side effects was because I didn't clearly portray just how much I've been struggling. I told her about a couple of OCD episodes this year without going into detail but I didn't tell her just how hard I've been finding life even taking it a day at a time, other than vaguely saying things haven't been good.

All this being said, I'm now a bit worried she's prescribed a placebo (I haven't got it yet). I was reading online that doctors do that more often than I thought. I'm in the UK and using NHS - do you think a dr would do that bearing in mind how many meds I've tried and the mental health reasons for them? I'm worried of getting a benefit from the placebo effect - I believe the placebo effect is very powerful and have read of it clearing up physical problems like rashes, however with my mental health I'd find it really invalidating. And I worry about getting some sort of reverse placebo effect, like it's not a placebo but I'm suspecting it is so I don't feel benefits because I'm thinking too much? How can I tell if venlafaxine is legit or placebo? I feel I heard something about batch number or similar can tell me but idk what to look for and need to know, I don't wanna be some sort of science experiment when my mental health is so much worse than I'm able to convey in a doctors appointment

And lastly - sorry it's so long and for all the rambling - I'm interested to hear if you've tried venlafaxine (heard it referred to a lot as effexor which I assume is a US common brand name) what you thought of it? Side effects/effectiveness etc? The dr said it's more for depression than anxiety and OCD from what I remember, however from what I'm seeing online it seems to be prescribed for all of them? I figure even if it just helps something it'll hopefully give me more headspace to help myself.

193,Bad Experiences with Mental Health Meds,"I want to find out other options for people for mental health medication. I have anxiety, depression, and PTSD which lead to extreme panic attacks. So far I’ve tried Lexapro, which was nice until I gained 50 lbs and stopped being sexually active completely, which hurt my relationship.

After having conversations with my medication manager, she switched me to Paxil. I’ve been on Paxil for about a year and the last two months I’ve gone down to taking it every other day and then once or twice a week. I made this decision on my own because it was making me extremely angry/irritable.

My medication manager kept telling me to wait and see if it levels out. She told me this two weeks after I started Paxil and again at the 6 month mark. 
Since I’ve started tapering off, I’ve been much in a better mood and active in my relationship. However, the panic attacks have come back full force.

200,Has anyone used EMDR to help with serious diagnoses like schizoaffective disorder (undiagnosed) without meds,"I’m early in my diagnosis but my therapist think I may have schizoaffective disorder. 

I am hearing constant thoughts in my head. Not necessarily different voices but like my own thoughts that are mean and nonstop. Like if I ask “I am…” I will hear my thoughts say “stupid, a loser, ugly” immediately. Not my own thoughts. They will just have such a negative response in my head to lots. 

There is a disconnect between my mind and body. My mind is “normal” and present but my body goes into fear-mode where I will be sitting down doing something and my heart will race (blood pressure goes to 85 BOM at rest when my normal is 50-60), I will feel fright, heavy chest, and it just lingers like my body goes into panic-mode. My conscious self mind is like, “what is going on… I’m literally fine” but I just have to let my body do its thing. It happens multiple times throughout the day. 

I haven’t been diagnosed with anything but my therapist seems to think it’s a response to old abandonment issues brought up in EMDR and an herb spiritual retreat that cause psychosis a month ago. She thinks as a theory my body is going into “I am scared and need help” mode so that I will be nurtured… like what I did not have during my abandonment 0-6 months then 6-11 months at the orphanage. Like my brain is misinterpreting that I am safe now. 

She seems to think meds just patch it and that you can still have this issue with meds. So basically that I shouldn’t take antipsychotics (not that I have yet been given them) and instead should work EMDR with her to rewire my brain to not see a threat and not panic my body. And that things like running in place and ice could try to trick my brain out of panic mode. Is this true or stupid to not try to take meds for this? 

I’m getting drained by my body racing and going into fright mode while my brain is trying to be present and feel through it.

218,I want to come off my psyche meds to cause harm to myself,"This is a throwaway, the closest people are on reddit themselves.

How do I start this without feeling like the biggest douche in the country.

I (37f) have been living with mental illness for a very long time. I have been diagnosed with Depression, an anxiety disorder, stress. I also have PTSD and suspected DID. I am on two antidepressant medications too, this will become relevant.

Recently my wife and my roommate moved a significant distance from where we were living. Myself and my wife both drive but our roommate does not so when we moved she had no way of getting to work so had to quit. She tried and struggled to get work, down here. I later find out that the last day at her old job that someone put a gun in her face and tried to rob her.

So for 5 months we paid our roommates bills and rent putting my wife and myself in dire straights financially. My wife works everyday and I have to too just to make ends meet which my roommate who now has a job only works part time.

Because of this and the stress I have not been in a good way and my mental health is through the floor. Unfortunately it has been coming out as frustrations directed at my roommate. This coupled with her experience with the robbery she told us she would be checking inpatient to a crisis center so she could get better. I want her to get better I truly do. I miss my friend and I miss having fun with her.

However I can’t stop feeling the anger. About two years prior I had a breakdown due to a job I couldn’t do any more. I wanted to check in to a facility back then but realized that I have responsibilities. She also has responsibilities too, and I feel like we’re having to pick them up again while she gets therapy. I’m jealous that she gets to get better and I’ve needed to go inpatient for so long. I hate feeling so damn numb all the time, being expected to be everyone’s shoulder to cry on.

I ended up having an self harm session where I slashed my legs about 30 times, I haven’t self harmed since 2007. I am ashamed, I’m guilty and I am angry. I don’t know what to do. Part of me wonders if I should stop taking my psych meds just so I’ll get bad and I can get committed, so it really isn’t my choice because I have to hold everyone and everything together. I just can’t stop feeling like this.

I want my friend to come out a better person but I need to heal too.

219,An Overwhelmed Pre-Med Student With a Messy/Unclean Apartment ,"Hey everyone it’s final exam season and I finished two of my tests already. I am a student in canada who’s from the middle east (missing home can’t wait to go back in 9 days but it’s also overwhelming). I order food a lot and I get too lazy to throw the bags out that I used up a whole room to gather them there until it’s time to get rid of all of them. There’s also gathered dust in the corners of my apartment, hair where I do my hair, and a lot of fruit flies (it’s under control now since I sprayed and made a trap but did not get rid of the takeout bags yet). I have a lot of laundry to wash, I have to pack 3 bags for my trip back, clean my 2 bathrooms, wipe, dust, and get rid of the crazy amount of takeout bags/ empty packages/ boxes. I would like to have my boyfriend over on the 26th of April the day before my trip back home since I literally haven’t let him in in the past few months because of the state of my apartment (we always go out or chill at his). 

Now here’s my issue, I have an exam tomorrow and my last exam is on the 22nd. These are very important exams and could determine my fate in this program. My lovely man told me there’s enough time to clean, pack, and have him over before I leave. He also told me to come over once i’m done with my daily dose of cleaning to watch our show and help me unwind (he lives in the same apartment complex as me). I have the 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, and possibly half of the 26th to have my apartment ready for him to come over and to finally leave for home. He knows that I have to clean but doesn’t know how messy and crazy my apartment is. I have never left my apartment for more than 2 weeks but I am leaving for 3-4 months this time so i’m also overthinking about what could happen if I don’t deep clean. I do not want any of my friends to help me because I am genuinely embarrassed. I always look put together, smell good, is ACTUALLY clean but not my apartment (apart from my bedroom/living room).

I don’t know what to do I feel so stressed out. I know i could clean it by myself because i’ve done it before. For reference, I live in a two bedroom two bathroom apartment with a living room and a kitchen.

220,why do i feel worse on meds??,"i was on prozac for almost a month and was experiencing extreme insomnia and night sweats, i also felt restless like my anxiety had gotten worse. i ended up developing hives from how much stress i was under or possibly an allergic reaction from the prozac. also it didnt necessarily make my depression better but rather numbed me out. i stopped taking it.
now im on zoloft, i took a dose of 25mg today and i almost had a panic attack. it was awful. im still recovering from it and it's been 5 hours. i tried sleeping it off and i just dont know. i dont know whats wrong with me. i looked it up and said symptoms improce when you stop taking it and honestly i want to do that, because i cant fucking handle panic attacks and the extra anxiety. i already feel like shit. i cant deal with this, i really cant. the fact anxiety/panic symptoms can last for a couple months??? i cant just get over it and whatever, it's going to make me suicidal. what do i do???",1682919115.0,False,1,4,loiterinheaven,None,134dnzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/134dnzy/why_do_i_feel_worse_on_meds/
221,Is it time for meds? How to ask?,"Hello all. I have struggled with mental health issues including OCD, anxiety, moderate paranoia, and rage attacks since I was a child. I am a young adult now, just about to graduate college, have been in therapy for 8 years, and have only gotten worse. Within the past year I have been in the hospital multiple times due to different things stemming from these issues, including symptoms from anxiety and OCD. I earlier this year I almost checked myself into a hospital due to a near blackout rage in which I was wandering around the town barely aware.  I have always been anti-medication due to my research in the over-medication of America and corporate culture of Big Pharma, but my quality of life is so destroyed at this point, that traditional coping mechanisms aren’t helping.  Most of the time I cant even implement my known coping mechanisms because I am so far gone. 

I have an appointment tomorrow that was scheduled as a follow up from my most recent anxiety induced ER visit. I plan to be as honest as I can, as downplaying for years has led to this point. Has the point come where I need to consider medication? Is there anything I should or shouldn’t say at the appointment?",1690750527.0,False,1,0,lucky_ubermensch,None,15dw7w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/15dw7w9/is_it_time_for_meds_how_to_ask/
222,Maladaptive Daydreaming and Anxiety Meds,"I’ve always had what I call movies in my head since I was young—like 7 or 8. When I watch tv shows I create my own storylines, listen to music and the same thing. My brain is always going. I didn’t have friends when I was younger and maybe this was a coping thing? Idk. But I love my movies and being able to enter the worlds I’ve created when I need to. 

Recently I had a panic attack and my brain just kind of shut off and I started to have to focus on what was happening to my body —like all the little sensations which caused more anxiety, or just go blank. I could access some of my “movies,” but not really. 

Now I’m on a low dose Zoloft and took my first pill today. I know it’s just placebo effect and it’s not actually hitting me yet, but my brain is still “shut off,” and I just feel so exhausted. I feel like I got high and I’m a bit disconnected or took an antihistamine. I hate it and am unsure what it’s coming from but I don’t want to feel that way. 

Maybe I just don’t know what a “normal brain” does all day, but i don’t like this quietness. Does anyone have any experience with this?",1675552413.0,False,1,3,AdriallRose,None,10tubnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/10tubnh/maladaptive_daydreaming_and_anxiety_meds/
223,Taking meds sucks,"I have a super duper strong aversion towards taking any meds regularly. B12 is easy after I found tablets which have crazy dosage and can be taken once in a while and they taste sweet, so I just take it when I remember about its existence and I want to eat something sweet. But there are other supplements I better take, and man it really feels like torture when I think about doing it daily for a long duration of time and which don't even have a taste.

And when there is no sense of urgency, I tend to be unproductive .
I currently feel really good on my current dose of Prozac and I wonder if am NRI such as strattara would be most beneficial to helping me become a more productive and motivated person.

226,Meds that mimic beer?,"The only thing that relieves my anxiety is a beer or two.  I don't ""abuse it"", never get drunk, but I do realize this is still considered self-medicating.  And obviously I can't do it all the time.

The people that I know that have taken medication for anxiety/depression... Act funny.  Their personalities are just gone.  They are just notably different than they were before meds and I just don't want to do that to myself.  Being ""calm"" is one thing, but forgetting how to smile (or smiling constantly all of a sudden) is an unacceptable side effect of meds in my opinion.

I have a therapist that I see regularly.  She helps, but she can't prescribe meds and I've platued in my progress with her.

228,struggling to start new meds,"cw: talking abt pills and mention of overdose
it’s literally been like over a year of work and stress and trying to advocate for myself to get on these meds, and i finally got the prescription and i have the meds and i just can’t bring myself to put them in my mouth. i’ve been on a few different meds in the past and i’ve had several overdoses and i’m just scared these aren’t going to work just like all the others and i’m going to do something i’ll regret. i’m not sure if i can handle the “it gets worse before it gets better” period but at the same time i so desperately need to get to the better part but i’m just so scared and i didn’t think it would be this hard just putting a stupid pill in my mouth and swallowing it. i’m fine with over the counter stuff and it doesn’t phase me at all so i figured i’d gotten over any aversions/anxiousness to pills but i guess not. and i know that once i start taking these meds these thoughts and worries are going to at the very least lessen a bit but i just can’t bring myself to take the first step. if there’s anyone out there who’s been through something similar or if you’re on the other side of this and you have any advice i would really appreciate it",1675439212.0,False,1,2,records_on_the_wall,None,10sng1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/10sng1n/struggling_to_start_new_meds/

At first I believe it might be too high a dosage so I start taking less, much less. It’s only when I’m off it so I find myself more productive the only downside of course being anxiety and this lingering self hatred although I’ve become better at masking my anxiety and have also become more social so I’d like to hear someone else’s thoughts.",1673352695.0,False,1,3,No_Author2844,None,1088bu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1088bu5/am_i_better_without_meds/
