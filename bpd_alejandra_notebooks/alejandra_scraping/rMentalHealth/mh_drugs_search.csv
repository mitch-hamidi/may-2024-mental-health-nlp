0,drugs and mental health?,"Awhile back I was constantly suicidal. Like psychotic level suicidal. I thought something was out to get me and it made me depressed beyond belief to the point that virtually no doctor could convince me to not kill myself. I felt that I absolutely had to do it and it was not optional as the alternative was absolute hell on earth with infinite suffering.

Then one day I injured myself accidently and had a minor surgical procedure. I was prescribed opioids like many people and after the very first pill it instantly pulled me out of an otherwise multi-year long, completely untreatable, psychotic depression cycle. Of course only for a few hours, but it was the largest improvement to my mental health I had ever seen. I actually cried because it was the first time I had felt anything that wasent complete suffering since before I could remember. but then fast forward a bit I went in trying many drugs, opioids, benzos, psychedelics, weed, ect. And honestly, they have helped for the most part. I am still depressed and have bad mood swings, but it is much better than before. I went on a vacation with my wife, took substances pretty much everyday, and had a blast. I was the greatest improvement in my mental health I have seen since before I can remember.

But then comes the negative, which started to become more apparent after about two years, is they are addictive and I am worried if they may effect my physical health . I want to take them all the time because I always feel like shit and they always make me feel better which makes them habit forming. So now I am stuck in the middle. They absolutely improved my quality of life and saved my life from what was otherwise a near guaranteed suicide, but I also now feel like I made a deal with the devil and I now forever owe the man. I didn't fully understand what I was getting myself into and now I kind of feel stuck. overall the drugs have been more helpful than harmful, but I feel trapped and dont really know what to do.

5, My Battle with Drugs and my mentalhealth,"Hello, my name is Pablo, and I'm 18 years old. My history with drugs began at 16 when I started consuming cannabis every day. It felt good at first until I began experiencing paranoia and panic attacks, and later, psychotic episodes with antidepressants.

 After the summer of 2023, marked by drug use, I began experiencing anxiety, OCD, and daily worries. I also noticed my vision deteriorating and felt disconnected from reality, with confusion and an unreal perception of reality. I couldn't think clearly. I started taking antidepressants in October 2023 for these reasons. My doctor mentioned it could be pseudodementia (a cognitive impairment due to depression). I started with Lexapro (escitalopram 20 mg), which didn't work well for me. I decided to consume cannabis, alcohol, cocaine, and MDMA while on antidepressant treatment. In February 2024, I switched to Vortioxetine (Trintellix 10 mg), but it didn't help much either. I continued consuming cocaine and alcohol.

 Right now, I'm worse off than before starting treatment in September 2023. My OCD has improved, but I still feel anxious about never getting better. I fear not returning to my old self. I have terrible memory, concentration, and poor vision (no diopters; I was told at the optician that I have high intraocular pressure, pending an ophthalmologist appointment). I started worrying about this in November; I couldn't watch a movie or perform tasks requiring mental effort. I had to drop out of higher education because I couldn't study.

 I used to be a good student, always passing exams. But now, I feel like I've lost a lot of intelligence. In November 2023, I had a brain CT scan, and they said my brain was fine; it was all mental. I've talked to my psychiatrist about this, but it hasn't helped. I would like to seek psychological help and hear people's experiences. Right now, I feel like I'm dead inside, like my life has no meaning. I can't study, can't work, and have no future ambitions.

I am also concerned that the interaction between drugs and antidepressants may have had some negative interaction leaving long term sequelae.

My days are spent wondering if I will ever get back to my old self.",1714418976.0,False,3,1,Ok-Ad2327,None,1cg807z,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cg807z/my_battle_with_drugs_and_my_mentalhealth/
6,I'm doing drugs again. Please I need some help.,"Well, those seven months of sobriety I obtained through hard work are now in the trash. I matched with my ex dealer on bumble and I do not know why I  thought it was a good idea to go see him. I ended up consuming once again, and fucked him while pretty high. I didn´t want to fuck but I felt as I should, since he was giving me drugs for free. It wasn't a pleasurable experience. After that he gave me free drugs and I bought some more, in essence I don't remember exactly what happend in the las few days (or maybe three weeks, I don't know). I go to rehab, but I've stopped attending since I don't want to tell this to anybody. Nobody knows, everyone thinks I'm doing great but I'm fucking up big time. OH, also, I'm Bipolar type 1 and I think this is heading to a manic episode. I'm quitting my job tomorrow probably because I'm not doing anything at all and my boss already had the talk with me. Nobody knows anything everybody thinks I'm doing fine. I don't want to fuck it up but I don't want to stop using drugs. I missed them so much and they are really fun. I forgot what getting high felt like, and using with somebody is so much fun. I'm crumbling into a million pieces why can't I be functional while on drugs. 

I just needed to vent, I needed to tell somebody. This is just a computer screen but the feeling of getting this out of my chest gives makes me at leats aknowledge the problem.

It's the only way I can describe it. Nostalgia. But not in a good way as this nostalgia feeling makes me feel sad and low. Even happy memories....its the most bizarre thing I have ever experienced and would just like to see if it happens to anyone else!

13,Conversations about recovery (drugs/alcohol),"To start things off, I've never been through any drug or alcohol recovery program. I personally have had my addictions but only to alcohol and though to this day I drink more than I know I should but have cut down immensely, been raised by and around drug addicts my whole life, some who have gotten clean, some who have passed away, and alot who ended up in prison again and again (my mother Included)

My experience is that people I know who have gone through recovery programs and relapse tend to be alot more harder on themselves to the point of taking their own life. 

My question to Reddit users is:
Why do people in Recovery self destruct quicker when they relapse than those who arent'?

 Ive seen so many who will relapse from meth and then spend a whole week as an emotional train wreck and more often than not either be in a MUCH worse mental state or go back to using worse than before. Meanwhile, I've seen some who just have a better support system around them come clean on their own.

I also want to make her distract herself with things that she likes and look for the even the smallest detail that would make her forget the drugs, because she told me that she is going to remove them but that it is a long process and that it will take time, she said that she wanted to get her pills by going to a place, as if she were referring to a free place. sunday (today is tuesday) we did everything that was out of our control because neither of us were disciplined (btw i used translator for this, is too long)  we cleaned the house, we fixed the kitchen, we washed the dishes (all this was thanks to a conversation we had after she coming home from a party and having problems) and did a lot of things that motivated me and wanted me to keep going, but this day she relapsed again into drugs, and i want to help her to finally leave that repetitive habit.

20,LETS TALK. DRUGS. MENTAL HEALTH. ADDICTION. SPIRITUALITY. POLITICS. AND SCIENCE. ACAB.,"Let's talk about addiction and drugs and mental health for a minute. And hell some politics and spiritualilty too because they're all topics that intertwine with one another. 

I apologise for the ramble but also I don't and I hope people read this and feedback because I want to talk about this. 

(TLDR : war on drugs needs to do one. people would be better of if they weren't made to feel wrong for understanding their own minds and bodies. if illegal drugs were administered by governments it would mean people have access to clean uncut drugs that they know work for themselves and this would ultimately help with addiction and abuse and long term physical and mental health) 

~
I'm gunna try be as succinct as I can but this will be a long post. 
~ 

I know it's a touchy subject and ultimately there is no straightforward answer to addiction and mental health issues and/or using an 'il/legal substance' to medicate said issue. 

Each individual is unique to their path and story and biology. Therefore, what applies to one may not apply to another.
If you have ever taken any drug (legal or otherwise) to treat a mental or physical health issues and spoken to people who do the same I'm sure you know what I mean. 

- 

Isn't the war on drugs just the funniest and stupidest thing around??? Time and time again in the last X years you are hearing and seeing about drugs that classified as illegal by governments (mainly western let's face it...) are being researched and tested to treat mental AND PHYSICAL health problems such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, ADHD, CANCER.

Magic mushrooms help with depression
MDMA can help people overcome PTSD
Ketamine can help with depression - and some might say ADHD symptoms... 
Weed - literally the miracle plant of this earth which has so so many uses and there are stories of people who have been given terminal cancer diagnosis' - gone abroad to get cannabis oil to take and they're terminal cancers have gone into remission. 

And then some I'm sure. But as said trying to keep this brief lol. 

- 

As someone who has dabbled in recreationally taking illegal substances most of my life and being around many people from all ages and walks of life who also do or have done. - Some of which are actually the most intelligent and successful and down to earth individuals I've ever had the pleasure of knowing or speaking with. 

I find it really difficult to stay quiet about it. 

Like why? 
Why are we still telling human beings they are not the ones who FEEL what they feel and KNOW what effects they feel from whatever form medication they decide to take. 

Who and what and when did we decide that some corporate drug administration or governing body gets to dictate which drugs are 'safe' to take to treat and mental or physical issue when we are the keepers of our own souls and minds. 
... especially when they've never given us any reason to trust them and their judgment and intentions lol ... 

We know ourselves better than anyone. 

Scientific evidence is generally based on theories that been researched and proved. But historically something can also be unproven right? (This is why I CBA with uni cause they'd expect me to reference something right now as an example and I know there are cause I remember reading about them but CBA right now it's 4am lol) 

- 

I see around me and around the world through forums where people discuss these things that actually treating addiction and mental health is never black and white. 

- 

I think the criminalisation of drugs does damage on the mental health of people who take criminalised drugs and this is a bigger problem than what people think the drugs do to said persons mental health. 

When someone is faced with fears and anxiety or judgement surrounding something they use that they inheritly for their own benefits it must create some kind negative pathway in the brain which is ultimately doing more harm than good? Do you follow what I mean? 

Anxiety and depression can cause immense stress. 

Stress affects cortisol levels.
Stress is also one of the biggest killers in the world. 

If you are stressed about having to hide being under the influence of an 'illegal' drug it will effect these levels and in turn have a negative impact on your health. 

Especially if it is long-term. 

So when you look around. And I know countless people who are on the spectrum and/or are diagnosed with ADHD who use substances such as ketamine and it's helps them function. It helps people overcome anxiety and depression and believe it or not makes them productive in certain environments. Myself included. 

~ Often the productivity is experienced in an environment where they feel safe from judgement of being under the influence. What a suprise...

-----

Over my short time on this earth so far I can safely say that using drugs isn't the problem. The criminalisation of drugs is. And why these specific drugs? 

What makes sertraline/etc safer than ketamine if you could access it as a pill over the counter and still get the antidepressant effects?

Why is there not any REAL research being made into how cannabis can be used to help treat various cancers, and other ailments in life!?!?! 

Why are magic mushrooms 'illegal' when they literally grow out of the ground and have zero negative health effects and in fact most anyone who has taken shrooms in their life would say it was an amazing time and/or helped them in their personal development!! 

Why do pharmaceutical companies and governing bodies ignore what's right in front of them? Like well and truly. 

-- 

I know why... The obvious reasons anyway.. 

But when do we as a society/societies actually wake up and do something. 

Be the change. 

Fight the fucking system. 

Nothing will ever change if we don't fucking talk about these things. People who are ignorant and just eat up all the negatives that are fed to them by entities with an agenda. 

... 
Dr Tara Stewart said we are going through what could only described as a spiritual revolution as human beings across the globe at the moment. 

And I would harvest a guess to this is because people in the wesrt are realising that holistic and not your typical run of the mill treatments for mental and physical health issues actually work. THEY ACTUALLY WORK GUYS. WOAH. 

YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW MUCH JUST REMEMBERING TO BREATH WILL HELP YOU A HELL OF A LOT. 

GO OUTSIDE A BIT MORE. 

EAT SOME FUCKING MUSHROOMS. 

GET FUCKING HIGH AND GET TO KNOW YOU.

THINGS ARE NOT OKAY IN ANY ASPECT OF LIFE AND THAT'S WHY EVERYONE'S MENTAL HEALTH IS TRASHED.

25,"Need emergency (fast acting) psych meds, super depressed, can't do illegal drugs(urine testing).","Try to keep as short as possible.

Male 36years old, 8 years prison, lifelong drug addict, on no meds (been 1 year off anti-depressants and everything).I've been more depressed than I ever have in my entire life. I have been clean from drugs for 1 year. Just got my CDL, should be working but Ive been ""on call"" after training for several weeks. Just moved back home. Home is in a remote part of the mountains in Crestline, CA. Have no car, live with deaf 88y/o grandfather. I have never been suicidal, but I'm getting close (I always just use drugs). I wish I were working, I feel like an unwanted guest in my home, my family hates me cuz I moved back with Grandpa, so my ex-wife and 5year old daughter that were living with him moved out. So my family blames me on why grandpa doesn't see my daughter. I wish they were both here, It's lonely living here I have no friends, my family makes me feel like I'm unwanted and blames me for GPA not seeing my daughter. It's like it would be better if I was dead, my family would be happier without me. Except grandpa and my daughter, they love me. 

Haven't showered in days, don't even want to get out of bed, have no reason to anyway. Wish I was working (not at home basically alone middle of nowhere with no one to talk to no friends almost no family at least to talk to). I don't have a car so I'm stuck here in the middle of nowhere. I have no reason to get out of bed, and it takes me 2 hours everyday to get out of bed. If I were to smoke some meth I would feel great again, have motivation to get out of bed and get shit done. I can't do illegal drugs because of my job. I have been obsessing about legal (semilegal) research chemicals that I could do and still pass drug tests. 3mmc, 2cmc, etc. but  I wish I had ordered them online weeks ago, what's stoping me is I know they are addictive af and have to wait long shipping times. I'm this close to sneaking out (basically escaping remember no car middle of nowhere house) to get some meth. At this point the risk is worth it, I have no reason for being, can bearely get out of bed.

I am going to dr tomorrow, going to ask for gabapentin because usually I take a few and I have energy, mood uplift, and motivation to get shit done. I'm going to ask for advice as to what psych med would be best for me and my situation. Obviously I need therapy and anti-depressants (which don't start working for 4 weeks). That takes lots of time to work. I need something that works instantly to lift my mood, depression, energy. I know taking legal reasearch chemicals isn't the answer, but for me it seems the best answer (it is), the time to delivery is alll that's stopped me. So, what kinds of medications should I be seeking from a psychiatrist? I don't plan on using drugs while working (driving), but until I have a reason to be alive (working), I need something to fill in the deep emptyness in my heart and severely missing chemicals in my brain. Gabapentin is the only thing I know of that I could see them ACTUALLY prescribing me and working somewhat. Can I ask for stimulants? How do I ask without sounding like I'm drug seeking (which I pretty much am, well, seeking an escape from depression that drugs have always given me for 20+ years.)

I'm doing so well right now if I was working, yet this being basically unemployed, alone, hated by most of my family, alone, has me so down. I'm drinking right now, Goddamn I hate alcohol but I need an escape. If there was a local store to buy cathinones or other stimulants besides caffeine I would love that. I still love my exwife but even now she wants nothing to do with me obviously or she would still be living here at grandpas and I would be so happy to be with my daughter.

I'm only looking for what to ask the doctor for and how, or some kind of chemical and/or stimulant that I can buy in store somewhere like at a GNC or something. I don't have 2 weeks to wait for research chemicals online, I'll be on meth long before then, and I'm trying to not do illegal drugs so I can keep my job and pass a drug test mostly. Thank you for your time, think of it as harm reduction on me and my life. Prison and homelessness seem better than this (friends and no depression), so I just need a mood lift until I start working again. Until I have a reason and purpose, again.

27,Need some advice on drug induced anxiety,"So about three weeks ago I took 20 mg of adderall in instant release form. Which is seemingly nothing compared to doses I’ve done before. I’ve taken up to 40 within the same day before, granted not all at once and not all instant release. 

Anyway the point is that it caused me to have this anxiety attack over seemingly nothing. The anxiety I felt is oddly similar to that I have felt while tripping on psychedelics. The most unfortunate part is that this feeling never fully left me.

Even three weeks later I still have anxiety from it everyday. It’s constantly on my mind. I wish that I hadn’t done this. Sometimes life feels pointless to me now. 

I’ve quit taking all forms of stimulants since including coffee and dark sodas for the most part. Some days I feel better than others. Yesterday was kinda rough compared to the last few days.

Also it’s probably important to add I’ve been smoking weed (probably around a gram a day no breaks) for about 4 or 5 years and I’m currently 18. I also vape nicotine daily for about as long. Occasionally drink but not enough that it should cause any problems (maybe once or twice every other week).

Another factor that may contribute may be the fact that I don’t get out much anymore.
Ever since I dropped out of school (a story for another day) I’ve been in my room all day pretty much. And there’s literally no windows in my room, no way to get any natural light, except the rest of my house which is usually occupied by my parents and their friends so I don’t much want to be out there all day.

Please feel free to ask any questions or redirect me to a more appropriate subreddit or any resource necessary. Thanks for taking the time to read.

29,I love drugs,"I have been on an almost 2 year bender taking things I buy online. I have gone only two weeks at most cold turkey going through horrible withdrawals (like the flu but 2x as bad) before hopping back on. There are severe ups and downs but I've never felt more myself and alive than on these drugs. To clarify I was very mentally ill before getting on anything so I didn't sabotage myself or anything, I already had nothing going on and had tried ending my life many times before. I never felt more happy though than on these drugs, I can laugh, I can cry, I can forget and disregard every bad thing. I also work out excessively (sometimes 10 hours a day) and drink on average 10 cups of coffee every day along with diet soda and energy drinks. I know this is insane but this is all I have. I like having total control over my mind. I don't need anyone else to feel happy, I will make myself happy by getting high and spending time with myself. I'm chronically lonely and it's been getting to me but at the same time I can't be with anyone. I daydream all day long (maladaptive daydreaming they call it) but I prefer it to real life. Real life is such a let down. There are a lot of beautiful things in the world but not enough money or cooperation to enjoy it. By cooperation I mean that people are quite closed off. I love the idea of people and things, when I leave my house I feel refreshed but also just want to never leave again by the time I get home. I have an idea of what life could be, should be but thats not reality. So I get insanely frustrated being too lonely, put myself out there a mega ton (feel refreshed but ultimately fail to change my life at all), retreat like a scared little boy to my fantasy world in the house and enjoy that until it's too much to bare staying inside again. In particular I want to start a career and get a girlfriend. I really want to have sex too. Maybe I shouldn't even bother though. I feel particularly haunted by my ex friends, ex partners. I miss them very much but the falling out I've had with everyone who used to be in my life is monumental.

30,"Antidepressants, antipsychotics and benzos made me addicted to street drugs. Did this happen to anybody else?","
I was a social drinker - never drank alone or to ease pain, just for fun and to overcome my shyness, but it never was a problem - and I did have some experiences with illicit drugs (not many, I wasn’t very interested) and I only smoked pot a handful of times. Not that the environmental circumstances weren’t there, I was surrounded by drug users and dealers and I never fell for them and I even sold weed and basically never smoked it. That was was until I was prescribed ssris first and benzodiazepines later at the age of 29/30. Slowly but steadily something started to change in me and I was always feeling empty and lost all focus, joy and interests. I fucked up my job, my relationships, friendships, music “career”, and all… and I kept having this emptiness inside of me, my mood was completely fucked, all my energies gone, I became passive, my sleep had changed and, even when I was off meds, I always felt like I needed something. That’s when cannabis made its appearance, I was never interested in it and at the age of 33 I started smoking steadily, before that I had started drinking more and doing more recreational drugs, but still socially. It’s like my chemistry had completely changed. Then I shook off the meds for a couple of years and I was doing pretty good, still smoking cannabis, but it was like I was a lot more functional. Then I got tinnitus right when Covid happened, and they put me on lexapro, aripiprazole, and benzos. I started feeling completely flat, empty, I was always down and moaning and my partner left me without notice. I couldn’t feel much, then after two years of Covid I started going out again but I was still feeling so empty, people gave me nothing, music gave me nothing, all my interests had vanished. And I became addicted to ketamine. It lasted only a few months. But that necessity of being out of it never went away. And it started gradually right when I began using meds. I remember and years years of it. I always needed something to fill that void. Did anybody else had similar experiences?

36,What are some causes for someone who used drugs to be stuck essentially?,"
TLDR AT THE BOTTOM**
Someone in my family had a long history of drug abuse. He got so bad he started being paranoid thinking people wanted to kill him. He did some kind of drug , who knows what and hasn’t been the same since . We dont know what happened, what he took, etc. we just know how he is now. He went to a hospital for a few weeks and they didn’t give any feedback or anything as to why. Currently his mamaw is trying to get power of attorney because the neurologist won’t even try to look into this without him saying h needs him to but there’s just no way. He now spends most of his time sitting on the couch staring off into space or (maybe) watching tv. His mamaw has to ask him if he’s hungry etc. if you talk to him he looks at you funny and then usually start’s uncontrollably laughing and says “what??” Or some times just won’t respond and looks at you and laughs. Today seemed different , he actually asked for a hug after my kids gave him by hugs he said “do you want a hug” and sounded like he used to . He doesn’t know how to play video games anymore or use a phone. Or even simple math. You ask him what’s 1 plus 1 and he looks confused and laughs and says “what” or “I don’t know” while laughing. He does respond to some stuff like if you ask him to get the mail he will. If you ask for a hug he will. If you ask an actual question though it’s a hit or miss 99% of the time , a miss. It’s honestly so sad to see . I feel like he’s trapped in his own body. It’s like his brain restarts every few seconds or something. He doesn’t know how to communicate right . I say bye and wave and he looks confused and just stares at me . Please any conditions you know of , drugs , etc that can cause this to help point in the right direction is appreciated. I’ve tried searching all over the internet for things like this but can’t find nothing on it. Just trying to get some tips or information while we wait to get things squared to get a doctor to look into him. TIA

Usually just sits and zones and if you talk to him , he typically responds with uncontrollable laughter and “what?” Can do some things.

Sometimes I wonder if I am neurodivergent in some way because of my behavior. But it never seemed to manifest when I was a child, therefor I deny that I have a sort of numerological condition. 

I've realized that I've become more childish and impulsive the older I get. I used to be more grounded, focused, praised for being ""mature"" when I was little.

 Now as an adult I am vehemently disorganized, ditzy, unfocused. I still have a tendency to be silent but now it's like I will act in unpredictable ways every so often. Sometimes these behaviors are self destructive too. Sometimes it's like I want to sabotage myself. To overshare and impulsively spout out nonsense for the sake of it. It's scary.

45,"Something is wrong with me (TW: SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, SLIBLING ABUSE, DRUG ABUSE)","Sorry if this post is disjointed and weird, I'm not in a good headspace. I'm going to be straightforward, I (16M) pointed a knife at my brother as a kid. It happened more than once, definitely twice. The first time it was over him not giving me the remote control, I can't remember what the second time was for, but maybe that's because I took some not prescribed meds afterwards. I felt guilty both times, but that's not the point, I still did it. The fact that happened more than once is fucking crazy, I still can't believe I was such a deranged bitch.

I have another brother, younger than the first that I slapped across the face twice. I don't understand why I would do something like that, but I know something is wrong with me. No normal person does things like that.

A lot of emotional abuse was also inflicted on my part. I was and still am a piece of shit. I'll insult and degrade my family members and make them feel small, then feel guilty afterwards like there's any fucking use. I guilt trip my friends, try to make them feel sorry for me, exaggerate things to make other people feel bad for me. I do bad things over and over and over again and every time, I say ""that's it, I'm going to change"", but I never do. I can feel guilt, but those feelings are somehow all centered towards how I feel.

I never wanted to get help, I couldn't give less of a shit about myself but I don't want to hurt anyone anymore. Am I just a bad person? I've had passive suicidal ideations since I was young, but for the benefit of others, should I do it? I just take up space everywhere I go, no one likes me, should I just kms? With my mindset, it's hard to think I could ever be redeemed.

49,Open Letter to my Drug Addicted Son,"Here I tell of the horrific experiences of watching my son suffer through drug and alcohol abuse. I write because my son would not listen to anyone who tried to help him and he denied he had a problem. If anyone reading this is an addict, I feel for you; I mean no harm to anyone by writing this. 

**Dear Son**

The day you were born, I felt overwhelmed with love for you. I felt blessed as I held your tiny body in my arms and thought you were the most beautiful being I had ever seen.

At the time of your birth, I had been in an abusive relationship for many years, and even though I felt that I truly loved my partner, I ended the relationship the day you were born. I did not want you to be raised in an abusive environment as I had been born. I was going to change my life for the better because of you.

I provided you with a beautiful, clean, loving home and worked hard to provide for you. Yes, I made mistakes when raising you, and I know I wasn’t perfect, but I loved you and did my best to give you 100 percent of me and my time to give you a good life.

When you reached your teenage years, you started disrespecting me. I forgave you because I loved you. By the time you reached the age of sixteen, your personality had transformed, and then I discovered you were using drugs and alcohol.

You were always intelligent, but you refused to do schoolwork. I did what I could to keep you in school, even though it meant me having to drive you there when I had other children to get to school. They were very stressful years for me, and I struggled to know how to deal with you because I had no role  

Eventually, I made you leave the family home because of your drug use, verbal abuse, and disrespect shown to me. You moved into an apartment with your girlfriend, and then you were both using drugs provided by her father. One day, I confronted the father, and if you hadn't been there and told me to stop, I would have done that man serious harm for dealing drugs to my son.

On one occasion, I was returning home after shopping. I was driving with my windows open. I could hear somewhere off in the distance someone screaming, Mum! Mum! It was a heart-wrenching scream and even more devastating as I turned the corner and realised it was you, my son, doing the screaming. You were staggering along the entrance to my street, crying for your mother. I pulled up beside you, got out of the car, and threw my arms around you. “I’m here,"" I said, as you fell into my arms sobbing. You were begging me to help you, and eventually, it transpired that you had been to a drugs party and had fallen unconscious and convinced someone had raped you. I took you to the emergency rape center, and I was grateful to find out that they did not rape you as you feared. Over the following years, you continued abusing drugs and having horrific incidences happen.

Often you would ring and ask for money because you were hungry, and eventually, there came the time when I had to find the inner strength to learn to say no, and as your mum, it was heart-breaking having to refuse to give you money for food.

One time I got a call from the hospital. They told me you were seriously ill and might not survive the next 24 hrs. I got to the hospital within minutes to find you with yellow skin, and I was terrified that you would die. I was very grateful that you survived and hoped and prayed that would be the end of your drug taking, but it wasn’t the end. Your drug taking got worse, and you bragged about spending £5 thousand on drugs in the month you got out of the hospital.models to show me how to be a parent. Both my parents were abusive alcoholics, and both died when I was really young because of drugs and alcoholism. Now I was being abused by my son. I forgave all the horrible things you said and did during those teenage years because I love you unconditionally. 

When you take drugs which are usually Cocaine and alcohol the result is always the same and you experience psychosis. It’s terrifying to watch you suffer from the paranoia you experience knowing that I am powerless to help you and make it all better for you.

Every four to six weeks for the past 14 years it has been the same routine, always the same horrific things happening to you because of your addictions and no one can help you. I know that if love was going to save you, you would be well but you tell me you can’t feel my love.

I have been single for over twenty-five years trying to manage my mental health problems of complex post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from the severe physical and mental abuse as a child from my alcoholic parents. I struggle to cope with your self-inflicted pain and I don’t know what to do when you won’t get help.

I have cried and begged you to get help because I can’t cope with living in constant fear of you getting killed and you called me a Narcissistic C..T. It broke my heart and spirit to hear your hurtful words and I felt totally shattered but I forgave you because I love you unconditionally.

You created your own business and doing well financially and you know that I am extremely proud of what you have achieved. I always knew that you were destined to do great things but still every 4 to 6 weeks you do the drugs and life is one constant drama because of your drug abuse. The feelings of fear and terror are with me constantly but you tell me it’s narcissistic for me to say that I’m scared because it’s you suffering and not me.

I remember I went on holiday with you, your girlfriend, and your new baby and you disappeared one night and I sat all night feeling terrified of what could have happened to you. The next day you came back with serious injuries to your back, the back of your head, and your tongue. You were without clothes because you had been robbed and you believed you had been run over by a car.

Having children did not stop your drug taking and violent psychosis and now you put your children and girlfriend through the same living hell you put me through. Two years ago I was diagnosed with stage 3 stomach cancer and had to fight to survive the treatment. I already struggle with arthritis in all my joints, Fibromyalgia brought on by trauma, lupus, and other conditions which means I live with constant pains that I deal with through exercise, meditation, and writing. I use no drugs to deal with my anxiety or lifelong depression and you said you were proud of me.

You were kind to me for a while during my time of Cancer. As I am unable to work because of all my conditions and I had run up a bit of debt you paid off my debt and paid for me to have a holiday because my anxiety had gotten the better of me and I was struggling to cope. I felt so loved and grateful for your help and support and I thought that everything was going to get better and we were going to have a chance at a normal life but I was so wrong. You have reminded me so many times that you helped me once and that I don’t appreciate what you did for me.

**You Physically Beat Me to Unconsciousness** 

Before I went on the holiday you paid for, I came to visit you and your new baby and you paid for the train journey. We went shopping for the food we were going to have and you picked up a bottle of wine, I had a bit of a panic attack but kept quiet and tried to convince myself that no harm would come from a glass of wine as long as there were no drugs involved.

We had a lovely afternoon in the garden of your beautiful home and I remember you had your arms around me all day telling me how much you loved me and I felt blessed. Later after taking my sleeping tablet I woke to the sound of someone screaming ‘Get off me!’ I jumped out of bed and ran towards the screaming and as I entered your bedroom I saw a large man standing over your girlfriend. I grabbed the man by the tee shirt to pull him away from her. It was you I was pulling but I didn’t know that but that didn’t stop you from turning around and punching me so hard that you knocked me unconscious and then continued to viciously beat me.

I must have been fighting for my life because when I came back to consciousness and realised I was being beaten I played dead and eventually you stopped punching me. I was laid on my back with you standing over me, hands on hips and panting. I heard you say to your girlfriend, ‘I’ve had to knock my mother out so get her in bed,’ Your girlfriend responded by saying ‘I can’t do it.’ I got up and ran screaming into the street and flagged down a car and begged them to help me because I had been beaten by my son. Eventually, the police brought me back to the house and I did not press charges because I was shocked and traumatised.

You never apologised for beating me, your crippled mother, unconscious. You told anyone who would listen that I jumped out of bed that night and just attacked you. You had no remorse for what you had done and for weeks I struggled to cope with what happened that night and my post-traumatic stress was triggered big time. I had been warned not to visit you while you were doing drugs but I didn’t listen because I love you and wanted to see the grandchildren and I paid for my mistake.

I spent Christmas 2021 in another country because I am so terrified of Christmas and how it will turn out like every Christmas of my 63 years on this earth. First with my parents, then abusive partners, and now my son. I have a phobia of Christmas because every year has been horrific. On Christmas day, I spoke to you and you were sober, and I was proud of you. I felt a sense of relief that all the drug taking could have come to an end but again I was wrong. The day after Christmas you used drugs and your girlfriend was desperately crying down the phone as she has done for the last eight years.

**Fearing For Your Life** 

Every time this happens I feel traumatised and frightened that you will kill yourself or something will happen to the Children. You survived the Christmas episode only to start again in March. The same story of fear, and trauma as I watch to see how it all will end.

In June 2022, you invited me to visit and despite my severe anxiety and fear of you I packed and prepared myself for the journey that you paid for. On the day of travel, you texted me to tell me not to bother coming for a visit because you had an argument with your girlfriend and you couldn’t be bothered seeing me. This meant I wasn’t seeing the children again and it was obvious that you were drugged up, psychotic, and paranoid while your children are watching in terror and being traumatised by your behaviour and change in personality.

I spoke to you on face-time and looked you straight in the eyes and pleaded with you to please stop with the drugs. ‘Think about your life, your children, and your girlfriend. We don’t want to lose you like I lost my parents. You said that I was a Narcissistic C..t and that I was the reason for all the drug taking and self-harming.

My heart and soul collapsed and just as I was going to give up on life, in that split second, I pulled myself together and for the first time in my life, I refused to allow my heart to break. I have other children and I’ve got to stay strong for them. As I write today I am waiting for the arrival of my grandchild by my daughter and I refuse to let all these drug and alcohol addictions spoil such a special occasion as it spoilt the births of all my other grandchildren. I know I have not been there emotionally for my other children because, you, even though you are now a man, get a lot of my attention and it has to stop.

I wish I could get to the bottom of your drug taking and get you help but I know you have to get the help yourself and you refuse to get help. You even deny that you have a problem. Please listen and understand that alcohol and cocaine are a deadly combination and can kill you.

**Enough is Enough** 

I refuse to pretend that everything is ok when it’s not. I refuse to go through the same pattern of behaviour every 6 weeks acting as if nothing has happened every time you survive an episode of drug taking. I feel hopeless to help you or your children from the suffering you are all going through and my fears are seen as selfish behaviour on my part. I feel seriously manipulated and have to walk on eggshells and I have felt like this for the 14 years you have done drugs.

No more will I accept your abusive behaviour and live in fear that if I do not behave the way you want me to I will be stopped from seeing the grandchildren.

One day I will stop crying for you and my heart will stop hurting but I can't do this anymore. You say you don’t feel my love so I will leave you alone. You can’t hurt me anymore because there is nothing left for you to hurt.

I have survived too much in my life to give up now. I have survived my drunken abusive mother constantly trying to kill me and I’ve survived the trauma of my dad and other men sexually and physically abusing me. I’ve survived extremely abusive partners and I will survive your abuse. Your brother is here showing me what love is and what is not love and your behaviour is not loving.

Always know that I love you and my love is unconditional. Right now I am going to love from a distance because I can’t cope with living in fear and I can’t cope with being abused and called a narcissist because I hurt and worry about you. All I have ever done is love you but it’s never enough and I refuse to sit quietly and pretend that I am not affected by your behaviour.

I'm sorry that you feel the need to take drugs. I'm sorry you feel like you can't tell me what is hurting you but I have my suspicions. I am sorry that you can’t feel my love and I’m sorry that I seem to be making it about myself and my suffering. I just want you to be well. I want to be able to spend quality time with you and my grandchildren but most of all I want you to get help and get well. I want you to know that you can come talk to me and I am willing to listen regardless of what you to have to tell me. I can’t help you if I don’t know what has happened to leave you feeling so hurt and traumatised and feeling the need to do drugs and alcohol.

After this most recent episode of drug taking and all the drama that came with it you are trying to ring me and then punishing me for not answering the phone. You want me to act as if everything is normal again and I won’t do it. that everything is okay when I know the same thing is going to happen again in 4 to 6 weeks. When I didn’t answer the phone you sent me a message saying,

‘I suspect you are ignoring me because you heard that I’ve hurt myself so you probably ‘couldn’t deal with it emotionally’ but don’t worry I won’t bother you again.

I know that I’ve got to love myself more and you know that my life mission has always been how to love myself and have self-respect. I can’t deal with constant abuse and nastiness from you and have self-respect at the same time. This is the last time I am going to plead with you to get help for your drug addiction. Get help for the pain you feel. Get help to deal with your demons for your own sake and the sake of your children.

I will be here waiting for my son and grandchildren to come back into my life and open arms. I will be here loving you and I know you love me. I have you in my heart and will wait for the day you come back to me when you have received real help for your addiction. I love you and I have always loved you so never forget that.

**If You Love an Alcoholic** 

For anyone who is reading this and suffering from alcohol or drug abuse, get some help. Abusing your family that loves you is not acceptable and addiction is not an excuse to abuse anyone.

I am a survivor of drug and alcohol-addicted parents and my life has been a struggle with mental health problems, low self-esteem, lack of self-worth, anxiety, depression, fibromyalgia, and other physical problems all brought about by the trauma inflicted by my addicted parents. If you have children then get help and don’t put your children through your addictions.

If like me you are the parent of a drug addict or an alcoholic know that they can only help themselves and you have to take care of yourselves. I am 63 years old and my life has been one continuous battle because my loved ones are addicts. Now my health is failing and there is nothing I can do to get back the time and live a good life. Don’t waste your life loving an addict because you are wasting your time and energy and they will not feel your love.

Love yourselves enough to put a stop to your suffering and let the addict find the help they need when they are ready. Please don’t waste your life in the same way that I have because you only get one chance at life and trust me when I say life goes quickly.",1670143912.0,False,123,14,LouiseElcross,None,zc4s9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/zc4s9l/open_letter_to_my_drug_addicted_son/

56,"My psychiatrist included a drug test with my blood level tests, what happens if something comes up?","I went last week for my first appointment with a psychiatrist. The appointment went well, she seems very nice, and she prescribed me two different medications (anxiety medication to take as needed and a low dosage of a mood stabilizer) as well as a LabCorps blood test to test my levels. I went in for my appointment this morning and was surprised when they asked for a urine sample, and when looking at the itemized bill it included a drug screening which I didn't know was part of the test. I was honest with her about occasionally using marijuana and my past with another substance but it's something I only used occasionally and haven't used since last summer so I'm not worried about those.

57,Extremely happy with drug shortages,"Drug distribution in the US is great. It's been nearly a year and, nationwide, we've been experiencing a shortage of nearly every variety of a particular stimulant medication. It's been going on so long and gotten severe enough that other medications with similar effects are also being affected. My doctor sent a scrip in two weeks ago that I, in theory, should have been able to pick up yesterday, the soonest I could legally refill it. I called the pharmacy to ask if it had been filled beforehand, and they said they hadn't been able to get any of it for three months.

*Three months!* That means that since the last time I refilled it and called every pharmacy in my city and nearby cities, they hadn't gotten any more of it. This would be my fourth go-around of calling every single pharmacy like a drug-addled secretary, asking if they have literally any variety of what I need to function like a normal human being instead of someone who forgets what they're saying while in the middle of saying it.

I guess what I'm saying is I'm trying to decide how best to go fuck myself. Even if I managed to find a place that magically had a supply (of literally anything), I would have to get my doctor to change the scrip and send it over. Usually that takes at least one day, and then there's the chance that somebody else did the exact same thing and got it before me. It's happened before, because there are plenty of people who just want to be able to function and are desperate to get any kind of medication to do so.",1688402871.0,False,3,4,DuskShy,None,14po97l,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/14po97l/extremely_happy_with_drug_shortages/
58,Are Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor drugs the problem?,"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11027847/amp/Depression-NOT-caused-low-serotonin-levels-study.html

This article came out recently where UCL top researchers carried out a series of analyses on drugs like SSRI’s and SNRI’s, ones that work on serotonin reuptake inhibition, and found that low levels of serotonin do not cause depression. 

I’ve had a lingering doubt about drugs which increase serotonin for awhile. I’ve been on them. Most people experience the side effect of feeling ‘numb’ on these drugs. I feel like this has a direct link to causing feelings of apathy (lack of interest or pleasure), and lack of motivation, as you have this numb feeling where you don’t care if you do anything or not. 

Do you think my theory has traction?
Are these drugs the problem?
If so, what’s the alternative, ones that work on Norepinephrine and/or Dopamine only? 

These drugs have been around so long now and the advancement in better treatment options is severely lacking.

The other psychiatrist thinks it was a drug induced psychosis due to the drugs I was taking, and the triggers I have now are a result of the damage that I caused to my brain from substance abuse. However this psychiatrist believes with time and hyperbaric oxygen therapy I can heal my brain and recover 100%. I will also add that I’ve been off anti psychotics for 3 months and feel pretty good besides the occasional trigger. I will also add that the last time I smoked weed was august of last year.

Parents refuse to acknowledge it..","It's driving me crazy for years now my sister (35) has wilted away and if we all go to a restaurant she has maybe one bite of food and makes up excuses... SHE DOES NOT EAT. She looks horrificly skinny I was appalled this summer when we went to Vancouver and she was wearing summer clothes (she usually wears baggy/flowy clothes to hide it) and I lost it I said ""OMG! What happened to you?!"" and eveyone just sorta looked away and she was like what do you mean?? I had a convo later with my parents and was like she's one step away from killing herself you NEED to say something and help her FFS. 

&#x200B;

She also gets fkn wasted every time we go for these dinners, always on my parents dime. Last time she cried for like 40 minutes and my parents STILL didn't say anything. I drove her home and on the walk she was rambling and walking up to homeless drug addicts and going all, ""OMG do you need help are you ok??"" it took like 10 minutes to walk one block. I've made comments before but I'm so annoyed she's like this, she had such a bright future but has major anxiety issues that prevented her from finishing Uni (my parents paid for it) and she is now 35 and works at bars for a couple years until she mysteriously is out of a job.

My mom refuses to accept she has issues, and every few months spends $1000 bucks on everyone to have a nice meal out at a restaurant .

I'd rather we just made a nice meal and stayed in and my mom used that money towards FIVE sessions of therapy for my sister...

69,Drugs/Medication,"It has long been my opinion that mental health prescriptions need an overhaul in how professionals approach them. From what I've been able to tell, psychiatrists simply ask about family back ground and symptoms and prescribe the drugs they like. The problem I have with this MO is that there's no indications as to why this drug is right for you. It's basically an a combination of guesses to determine what's right for you. In my life, i've been diagnosed as bipolar, major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and BPD and I've received medications for many of them. But at some point it had occurred to me that some many clinical issues rely on detailed metrics, studies, blood tests, etc. such that I get the feeling that mental health is just not taken as seriously. For example, you're not going to receive a prescription for blood pressure control unless they can identify a pattern of high or low blood pressure. You're not going to get a heart medication without detailed imaging of your heart and a battery of tests. You're not going to be prescribed methadone unless you've had a history of heroin/opiate abuse. You're not going to be prescribed lipitor unless they've noticed high cholesterol. But when it comes to mental health, asking a few questions in a 1-2 hour session is all they need to pick a drug.

I've noted this post as a question for a reason. I wanted to know if any health care people out there have any insight into why this is. Apparently medicine is good enough to determine brain chemistry and brain imaging can tell you a lot about a person but is there any particular reason that these doctors are not held to the same high standard as every other medical health professional? It just seems like throwing stuff at a wall until something sticks (if you're lucky enough to get that far). I understand medicine has a lot of outside influence such as financial, political, insurance, etc. But doesnt it seem kind of ridiculous to do things this way? I mean, if we lacked the ability to do these things, I'd get it, but we DO have the ability to do brain scans and take something away from that. I don't have the background to say how relevant such information could be but anything that makes me feel better than ""well let's try this because this is the drug I like or this is what worked for aunt sue"" would make me feel better about a drug I would take.

I guess I pose this conjecture for the reason that, I've always wondered why the double standard in medicine when it's sooo important. And 2 I don't have any faith in medicine to actually help me. I'm in a bit of a rough spot right now and I don't trust a psychiatrist to do anything right by me. If I went to see a psych professional it would be ""here try this other SSRI"". Okay well, I've tried a few of them and none of the others worked so why do you think this one will? And they'd just be like, meh because we can't do anything else. If I asked ""what makes you think this drug is right for me"" I don't think that I could believe anything they say. A conversation can only go so far in these evaluations and that all the eggs are in the conversation basket seems irresponsible of the mental health profession/industry. I would definitely feel better seeking medication if they could look at something, evaluate something ABOUT ME and not relatives.

70,Techno Love Drugs,"Last weekend I was at a techno party, Puls. The event was kept in a remote area near the city. It kept on for 2 days.
I'll go straight to the subject. I got insanely high in the first night and fell deeply in love with a blonde girl 2 years older than me but who was for me at that time my whole world the moon and the starts. She was my dream.
The thing is in the first night I couldn't even ask her name because something made me hesitate and I couldn't do it. 
I wasn't sure if I would make it the next night but when I woke up the first thing that came to mind was her and I knew I needed to see her. So I got there after many attempts I finally managed to get her name. Her name is Ema and she is 19, a junkie even more hard-core than me.
So yeah long story short I had to leave and I couldn't even ask her if she has Instagram or Facebook. My brain was too fried, I wanted to say something and said something else. 
..Now my issue comes here. I am constantly thinking about her since Saturday. I can't get her out from my head and I don't know what to do. I am so frustrated by the fact that I am so dumb and baked sometimes that I wish I hadn't done drugs but drugs led me to her so... =)
But yeah I don't know why can't I stop think about her? 
Is it because I felt so amazing at the party? 
Is it because it was ""love at first sight""?

I need help, I know she will be a good and a bad memory because I can't reach to her in any way, she lives at about 600km from me.

71,On Zoloft. Coworker accused me of using drugs on the job to my bosses. That I’m “too mellow.”,"Should I tell me bosses the reason I’m on medication? Should I tell them that I’ve struggled with my mental health?  Am I being discriminated against for my mental health?

I started Zoloft in September on 25mg. Started to feel like it was not working so I asked my doctor to give me a higher dose. When I started on the 50 MG I told my team lead that they changed my dose, and that I felt very dizzy. I didn’t think much of it. 
   I like to think I do pretty well at my job. I work with kids with intellectual disabilities and I work directly with my team lead. I love love what I do, and I deeply care for every individual.  
       It’s been brought to my attention that this lady, we will call her “Karen,” who also happens to be a team lead,  but NOT MINE, told my boss is that she thought I was on drugs that I look high my sessions, and that I’m very mellow.
     Just FYI I’ve been told is my whole life, that I always look high. And every time I’m told this I think it’s so funny because it’s just my eyes and I have very small eyes. Sometimes I squint, because I never wear my glasses. I don’t even work directly with Karen, but she had the audacity to tell my bosses that I was on drugs, and they were going to drug test me randomly. My team lead defended me mentioning to my boss is that my dosage has changed. Shout out to her! 
    If you are on Zoloft yourself, you know the common side effects. I tend to get very dizzy, and I’m pretty chill and laid back(it’s working this time).
I honestly feel like it’s kind of my fault for not disclosing the fact that I’m on medication to my bosses, but I do mention it pretty often to my coworkers. When I was told this I felt so embarrassed, so ashamed. I have yet to get a clinical diagnosis from a psychologist, but I believe I have BPD and severe depression. I’ve always struggled with my anxiety since I was eight years old. The reason why I didn’t disclose is this because I didn’t think It would ever hinder my work. 
  
Now, on another note, I am that girl!! At every job that I’ve ever been at, I’ve always had the older women hate on me, for no apparent reason. I’m always super respectful and nice to everybody. I am always willing to help, but I guess that’s not enough. Every morning I always tell her good morning and greet her and sometimes I don’t get a response back. I constantly catch her eyeballing my outfit. This woman is in her late 30s. I am young, not ugly at all LOL, and living in my 20fine years.  I think the people that are miserable always try to attack me!!!!(in general of course)
It baffles me that as a grown woman she is talking about me when I’ve done absolutely nothing to her, but I’ve always seen a pattern of unhappy women coming at me this way. 

But this truly upset me, because without my medication I am an anxious mess. Without my meds, I worry about the smallest of things; how I walk, how I talk, how I do this or that. I micromanage my every single move. I get very highs and lows. I either feel very happy, or I get so sad to the point where the only option is kicking the bucket. Constant panic attacks. I have came a LONG way and this year I’ve decided to get the proper help I need. I NEVER like to talk about it because it is nobody’s problem but my OWN. Going to a consultation with a counselor this week. 
       I got so upset that the day after I was just bawling in my car, i tell myself I wish I could function normally without intrusive thoughts, without medication. It helps me so much to stay afloat, and I don’t even get support from my family for it. My mom tells me to try to get off of them but this is the best I’ve felt in forever. Why should I try to get off or them if they’re helping me? 


But to conclude, how do I tell my bosses all of this? In the most professional way. Would this be employee discrimination? This is such a major setback for me.

85,"Mental health, drugs did not help","This is my first post on Reddit btw😎
Just so you know some of the spelling and use of words may be incorrect because I find it very hard to put words into sentences that make sense and dislexia doesn’t help

(First part is just backstory)
Me 18M have had a past with heavy drugs, mdma, ketamine, cocain lsd, Xanax, codeine,
And I’m currently smoking a unhoaly amount of weed where I can’t sleep without it and if I don’t smoke I become desperate to get more and will find ways.
I’ve never been addicted to a substance on its own, I had/still have substance dependence that is pretty bad,
Only a few weeks ago I had a Xanax overdose where my own mother had to can a ambulance I can’t remember what else happened (if you have tryed Xanax you know it blacks your memory out)
And that has done no good to my mental health

As a child I was told that I was difficult, I was always very emotional, as a adult im still very emotional, I was bullied in school in about year 8 and below and after that it all kinda stopped, 

When I left year 11 that’s when I started experimenting with substances my first was mdma, after my first time, my next time was the next week and that went on for 4 months 
I was stealing money to buy a lot of cocain 
At one point,

1 year ago, I got into a relationship with this girl ,she ment the the absolute world to me, all was going grate, we got clean together from all drugs, and it was the longest time I’ve been sober for that I can remember, this girl was going to party’s a lot without me, I always told her that I didn’t feel comfortable with her going because of us being sober together and her being around guys she’s never even known, and we all know what some guys are like when there on drugs, I woudnt want anything to happen to her, I always thought he worst when I shouldn’t of, she got really man when I mentioned that to her, her friends didn’t like it ither, I put all my effort into that relationship and towards the 4 month mark it felt like she was giving up, always wanting to go to party’s, I was travelling 30 miles nearly every day to see her, I always brought her gifts and food and sometimes she really didn’t seem like she liked it, she looked almost embarrassed of me, (there is a lot more to it but it will take a long time to type)

When that relationship ended, I started self harming abusing drugs again, you can say I was dependant on this girl, because I was, I’ve never felt affection like she showed me, I’ve never been close with my parents and never really got affection that I liked, it was always them pushing me onwards with shit

(This is where all my mental health issues come in)
In the past 6 months I have moved far away from my home town where all my friends are, I’ve known people who have lived in my new aria for a long time, but I’ve never been close with someone to sit down and talk, all me and friends do here is just skate, but not having that many friend and having alot of time to think and I realized the way I think and the way I do things isn’t normal, and that I need help with it, I’ve been meaning to call a doctor to get a appointment for months, but I always tell myself I’m going to do it, then I forget about it untill the next break down, 
I find extremely easy work to your average joe very hard, I sometimes get overwhelmed and get angry at myself or it makes me more depressed thinking that I just want to be able to do the basic things, one example is I struggle to read very badly , the drug usage has definitely had its affect on by brain, 100% I’m trying to stay clean but going cold Turky is hard so I’m not just sticking to weed, it’s not doing my any better but it gives me that time to calm down and not give a shit about anything, I always keep meaning to do things, the simple things, like take cups down from my room, organise my room, call the doctor or even do small simple things for my mum but it’s ither I forget or I know I should do it, but I have no motivation to, so I just sit there knowing I need to do it till I forget about it,

I also seem to overshare a lot of personal details without meaning to, example
If I’m talking to someone at work who I well get on with I will overshare things that shouldn’t be said,

I also have issues talking to new people, if Im hanging around a friend who I can talk to, then his friends come, I will sit there in silence, I know I’m being quiet, I’m thinking of what I should say but I can’r think of anything at all, then that also gives me crippling anxiety where I don’t know what to do
Like if I’m in a shop buying something and they try to have a conversation it seems like I make it awkward, I’m aware of this at the time, but I genuinely don’t know how to respond

I think the lack of not being with people that I know and rotting in my room for months has killed my social life, I always liked going out with people, but now I have no one, my closest friends have all stopped communicating with me, I’m still talking to my ex knowing that it probably isn’t the best thing
The lonley ness is really getting to me
My confidence has gone way down and I’ve never been self conscious about anything but now I’m self conscious about the way I look the way I act the way I dress, literally everything about me
I manage to cope with this somehow by skating and doing graffiti which destract a me from it all but I know when I put that can of paint down or my skateboard I’ll be thinking deep like I always do
 
I AM NOT DIAGNOSED with anything
But from what I think, I may have adhd, add, anxiety disorder, some form of autism 

Feel free to ask questions or even give advise it will be much appreciated

I have lot more issues but I think I’ve made this way to long, if people want I can make another post about some more of the issues I have, I want to see if people have the same thing as me or think in a similar way, just the thought of that will make me a lot more comfortable being me",1655632803.0,False,3,1,Nutbusterbuster,None,vfrv9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/vfrv9p/mental_health_drugs_did_not_help/

87,What is a sign that your doctor is a drug pusher?,"I recently began receiving outpatient care from a local clinic system. The therapist was awesome and gave me some real critical thinking points. However, two weeks later I met with great disappointment over the ""psychiatrist"". Quite a lot of orange and red flags we're going on even within the waiting room. 

Ie. Conflict with the patient before me, not doing her own intakes, not being a doctor (as I was led to believe) and expecting an intake to last no longer than 30 minutes. 

I decided to benefit of the doubt most of this, as I am educated in this field as well, so I am not against a med student or a nurse-practitioner working on my case. So after a forty minute intake, they conferred over the bullet points of my information that the student took down and... ignored everything I said as irrelevant because they didn't like how I speak.

They seemed very obsessed with starting me on one of the two most popular meds being pushed right now. I have a history with severe adverse effects from newer medications, they also ignored this. I felt like a walking paycheck to them and when I challenged their logic they told me they would ""increase the dose, until it did work"" not consider they made a mistake.

I have had a family emergency this past two weeks that delayed me from trying this medication and I am back to just feeling completely uncomfortable with it again. My previous psychologist told me if anyone tried to label me with a pop-psych diagnosis to get up and walk right out of there. Sadly, I can't return to her due to covid-19, but does this sound like a case of shoving a square peg in a round hole for a quick buck?

cognitive deficits (memory,   
executive function,   
general cognition,   
work memory, issues)  
as a result of MDMA Abuse(one time, high dose), and/or Depression.  
Basically, I feel like atleast 25-30 % of my brain has been hijacked ever since.

Which antidepressant / other drugs  / combination of drugs is/are most likely to improve the   
functioning of my brain?  
I have no intention of becoming a zombified blob that eats/sleeps and cares to do little else.  
I do not care about feeling less depressed if this comes at the expense of general cognitive function,

95,A former drug addict with a new lease on life.,"&#x200B;

I am not seeking drugs. 36/M seeking advice, validation, and opinions.  
I was never a good student, or very “focused” in high school. I tried to explain it as best as I could to my parents that no matter how hard I tried I couldn't seem to focus or understand problems that teachers would assign us. I remember seeing “FOCUS” written on every report test grade or homework assignment I would actually hand in.   
	At the age of 14, I found what I thought I was looking for in Marijuana and was instantly labeled an addict. Labeled such by my parents, my teachers, counselors, and every other authority figure in my life. So if you combine the marijuana use which became habitual because it made me achieve that “focus” everyone demanded from me, The authoritative damnation, and a history in roman catholicism and being told to blindly follow authority by your parents you end up with me.  
	A 36-year-old loser who constantly debates with feelings of self-doubt, drug abuse, and his own identity.  
	Now Im sure that once you heard drug abuse you probably damned me into the world of addicts but hear me out. As long as you have not drunk the AA Kool-Aid then I'm hoping this won’t fall on deaf ears.   
I was recently diagnosed with ADHD by several different healthcare professionals. They all see it in me as soon as they lay eyes on me. However, because of drug abuse in my past, they will not prescribe me stimulant medication, which I believe is the most effective treatment for ADHD. It increases dopamine in the brain, which alleviates the effects of ADHD. I found that state of Nirvana, peace and harmony many years ago but it was drug-induced and obviously I chaced that feeling, with some ferocity, for years. I honestly feel that if I had been diagnosed at an early age, and medicated properly I would have been able to lead a much better life.   
I was misdiagnosed left and right as a child, and then as a young adult I would tell doctors confidently I did not have ADHD i was just nervous, to explain the shaking rapid movements, and fidgetiness I would display in their office. I carried this false confidence into life which made making friends hard, because they all thought I was nuts.  
I have tried zoloft, buspar, wellbutrin,prozac and xanax in the pharmaceutical realm. The only thing that seemed to alleviate my symptoms was xanax but it made me too spacey to focus and lowered my inhibitions considerably.    
In the recreational realm I tried cocaine, all forms of marijuana, meth, heroin, and ketamine. While marijuana does benefit me I have zero motivation while high so I haven't accomplished a whole lot. The only one that would provide any relief and not just cause addiction or make me a paranoid mess, was ketamine. I’d do a couple of lines and “wonk out” for awhile but I always woke up with a sense of purpose, direction and the ability to carry out or even make plans.   
\`While I am all for psychotherapy I need something to start working for me in a positive way now if I want to be successful in my life because of the years of abuse I don't have much time left, and because of the ADHD, I have 0 patience.   
I am all for psychotherapy, and medication management, and even being drug tested on a regular basis to make sure that I am not abusing my medication or taking any other drugs, but I cannot seem to find a facility or a doctor who will take me seriously.

97,"I'm 27, lost half my life to drugs, have no friends, no job, can't drive, and have never touched a girl. [LONG]","I don't know what to do.  
  
I have severe anxiety... and when I say this I don't mean when TikTokers say ""I have to deal with anxiety so much!"".  
  
Instead my anxiety is so bad it's to the point where I sweat any time I'm in a public place. I have a sweatshirt I wear EVERY SINGLE TIME I leave the house. Even in 80F weather. My eyes dart around looking for threats. When my dog barks at someone near the house I get dizzy and struggle to breathe.  
  
My anxiety is the REAL REAL bad kind. I've never met anyone with the same level of anxiety I have.  
  
It started when I was 14 and moved houses. My doctor prescribed me Xanax. It worked wonders for my anxiety, but she never told us it was addictive. I was given my bottle to go to school and take as needed. I would take them too often and start falling asleep and stumbling in the hallways, needing to hold the wall to not fall.  
  
Not too long after that I started buying them and I found the direct source. Like as close as you can get to buying it from the company itself. So I got thousands of doses for $20. I went through it like candy, sleeping, failing school, sent to mental wards constantly.  
  
As it got worse and I got older I started losing huge chunks of memory, even from before I started taking it I couldn't remember things people would try to remind me of. I also became an asshole. My lifelong friends started to hint that they wanted me to go away. So I did.  
  
A little after that I'd get in fist fights with my older brother and my sister told her kids they can't see me.  
  
That's when I got clean for the first time. At age 20.  
  
Not much longer after that I realized... being clean and trying to deal with the anxiety wasn't worth it. I wanted to fall asleep and never wake up. So I relapsed.  
  
I decided I'd rather destroy my brain and sleep my life away as long as I felt a little bit of peace from the hell of living in my brain.  
  
I got in trouble and got clean again at 23. Dealt with it for 3 years, never left my room. Never. Only for food and doctors.  
  
I'm now 27, relapsed.  
  
I've never had a job. Never learned to drive. Have no friends. Never talked to or touched a girl (and wouldn't have the confidence or opportunity to).  
  
Therapy does not help me. I've tried countless medications.

109,My best friend is experimenting with drugs and alcohol and I don't know how to help her,"My best friend is going through an incredibly tough time with her abusive parents since she was a toddler. They have been subjecting her to physical, emotional, and psychological abuse, which has taken a toll on her well-being. She has always been a straight-A student, and I've admired her as an inspiration to stay focused on my studies and never give up. However, lately, I've noticed a significant change in her behavior.  
  
It started with her giving dry replies and not initiating conversations, which continued for weeks and led to days of not talking. We had an argument last week about not spending time together, but we resolved it later on. In a late-night conversation today, she confessed that her summer has been great, but her day was terrible. She made a promise to a good friend not to engage in drinking and drugs, but she broke that promise and admitted to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, using weed, and drinking with so-called ""friends.""  
  
I had a lengthy conversation with her about the harmful effects of such habits, but she claimed that they helped her forget the memories of trauma her parents caused. We both attend a prestigious high school, and it saddened me to hear her say that she no longer wants to excel academically and is willing to settle for Cs and Ds. The friend I once knew would never settle for less than her best.  
  
She blamed her parents for the way she feels and believes she doesn't need help because she thinks she's at the best stage of her life. I'm worried about her well-being as she is just fifteen years old. My heartfelt wish is for her to pursue her goals and dreams wholeheartedly, finding the path that brings her the greatest joy and fulfillment.  
  
I don't want her to go through any more pain, but I know her current friends might be taking advantage of her vulnerability.  My sincerest hope is that she values herself enough not to settle for toxic relationships with people whose only concern is finding substances to consume. She deserves to be surrounded by caring and positive influences that support her dreams and aspirations. 

How can I make her stop and reconsider her actions? How can I help her understand that prioritizing her mental health is essential for her future happiness and success?

We have a meeting planned on Tuesday to hang out together, and I want to make it a special day for my friend. I really want her to forget about her troubles and understand that I'm here to support her through thick and thin, and that I love her deeply. How can I achieve that?

112,"A poem I wrote on Bulimia, Bipolar, and drug addiction","I have the ""trifecta"" they say

I'm infected with a disease

A disease that makes your throat dry, your body weak and your nose sneeze

Its not a cold but a cycle

Not a cycle of life but one never-ending, though always in death

Death, must I not be spared?

You watch as I kill myself slowly, though front as never scared

The sequence repeats as cycles do, never getting old

Binge, purge, indulge, and knock out cold

Death, that creep

The one whom peers around my shoulder and sneers at me

Who reaps the souls damned like mine

Death, that beast

Watching as I pig out and feast, like a starving child whos never had the privelage to eat

""Throw it all up"" you say

""Take 20 laxatives, you must""

An empty girl can feel no lust

Heading no warning as I swallow those miscellaneous pills and snort those substances of dust

""Feed your sorrow, cover it all up""

The rush moves through my blood 

Short-lived ""fun""

Yet soon, down, I fall like a dive into a canyon

Now I close my eyes and rest as REM we do not know, a sanctuary inhabitated by no man

Repeat the cycle as I wake

And never forget to clean up the mess I make



Bulimia is like Bipolar is like a drug addict

Running off of dopamine and an instant switch

On the cold bathroom floor I lay in nothing but pain

Beside a toilet covered in shit and vomit stains

To simply flip a switch, ingest, do a bump

I get up and hastily clean it all up

Acting as though nothing ever happened with my temporary newfound energy

Just to do it all again the next day

A never ending cycle

Granted, there are definitely those who benefit from the prescription drugs with little to no side effects and Im happy for them and I wish them all the best, truly I do. But for myself, none of them seem to work and my OCD seems to be getting worse (i.e. progressing from simply favoring or despising certain number to actually counting things I have and do, etc). Thankfully Im not yet in the severe stages of OCD where I have to count my steps or arrange everything in terms of size/color/etc. and get bent out of shape when something is moved and I hope to never get that far.

Im a male in my mid twenties and Ive been fighting OCD for a few years now and while I am thankfully able to control it enough to where I dont get crazy about it, it is getting gradually lees and less easy to control and Im trying to find something that is either a natural (i.e. herbal supplement) or some method of mentally thinking more positive and helping me either get rid of it completely or at least making it easier to deal with.

I have nobody who i can talk to at the moment so i thought i would turn to reddit. Excuse my Bad grammer please because I am on mobile and currently having a panic attack. I will try to keep myself short and would appreciate any help


I am a male in his early 20s and I have been struggling with on and off drug addiction for the past 2 years. I have been struggling with mental health issues since i was a kid and never went and got any help. 2 years ago i decided I was done with life and attempted suicide 2 times and failed both times. I turned to drugs because of childhood trauma and quickly got into a self destructive cycle. It is honestly a miracle that i am still alive considering the amount of drugs i consumed. Recently I have learned to appreciate the small things in life and decided it was worth giving life a another shot. I was hospitalized twice after suffering psychosis and severe Panic attacks but they have never put me in a psych ward or took me seriously. I decided to cold turkey benzos and stimulants (I know i know) and am currently in withdrawal. Staying away from drugs is honestly Not that hard at the moment because I know that i will suffer another Panic Attack and land in a psych ward if i Touch that stuff again. Well as you have probably guessed I have not been very functional for the past 2 years and have been a burden for my parents especially since they know nothing about my addiction and its hard to reason with them. My parents are divorced and still live in the same Apartment because of financial issues. My dad has become mentally abusive and my mom has become a full blown alcoholic. On some days she will Drink nothing and act normal and on Other days she will Drink a whole bottle of Whiskey and Start arguing with my dad. My dad has put his hands on her once before and it has come to a Point where i am afraid to leave the Apartment as soon as they start arguing because i fear that my dad will lose it and beat her up. It's like her whole personality Changes when she gets drunk and she keeps on yelling and saying the stupidest things. My mom has had brain surgery 3 times and her health is declining fast since she has been sitting at home for the past few years and doing nothing but Smoking cigarettes and drinking. I got my own Apartment a couple months ago because i didn't want to watch my parents fight constantly but yet i still sleep at my parents House because i am afraid that something will happen between them. My dad offered to Take the Apartment so i can live with my mother but i cant watch her slowly kill herself anymore and live in this Environment. I honestly have no Idea what to do or where to even start. I used to do great in school but couldn't graduate because of my mental health issues and drug addiction. I plan on Going Back to school and getting my Diploma but i just cant with this much on my mind. Atleast i will have a full time job next month and my dad wont have to Help pay for my Rent anymore. I feel like so much is on my shoulders because my parents always Tell me to make something Out of myself because they have given Up on themselves already.

122,Help with family member who I think have mental problems and might be in drug,"Hi all, I need help on what to do concerning my sister. I think she's abusing drugs. I am not sure what kind and I haven't caught her in the act. But back in 2020 when our dad passed away she changed completely. Started smoking weed and behaving weird. She drove her car to Saskatoon (Canada) one time, left the car and all her belongings on the road and started walking bare feet back to Regina (Canada). The police stopped her on the road and gave her a ride back to Regina. She was staying with a mutual friend of ours in Regina but the rooomate had to ask her to leave because was behaving weird, walking around naked, calling the girl her wife etc. I eventually went to get her to come back to Vancouver (Canada) with me but she left and went to Winnipeg (Canada). She started staying in shelter homes and she told me one time she tried cocaine. She also said she is married to Rihanna and that her kid is theirs. I told her she's not. It's just a bunch of stuff. I went to Winnipeg took her back with me to Vancouver and I noticed her behaviour. She was shaking and itching and I asked her what's wrong she said oh it's just her tooth aching but I think she must have been going through withdrawal maybe. She got back taking weed again. I told her it's not good that I think she has some mental issues. She never really acknowledged our dad passing as she said it was our fault we didn't look after my dad. I sent her back home to Nigeria, maybe my mum would better take care of her. It was a mess, my mum got her to go to rehab there and she insulted her in a lot of ways. My whole family have been affected in some way because of her. She called me one time from Nigeria saying she was going to kill one of our junior siblings if she doesn't stop misbehaving. After rehab she started getting herself back gradually, eating good and looked healthy and we were all happy. The doctor told her not to go back to taking drugs and she promised not to. She came back to Canada last year and things have started looking bad the way it was before. She's looking more skinny now, always talking anyhow, she said she was going to murder me and I told her if she touches me I will call the cops on her. I don't even feel safe living with her anymore. She claims she's married to some other woman that she has a wife and I told her she doesn't have a wife she delusional and needs help.
She's claims she's not using drug but she has to be on something. This is just a summary as I can't type everything here. She's almost 30 and her life is just messed up. I feel sad for her and I want to help her. This is not the elder sister I grew up with. She has changed so much and it's sad to see I don't want to keep telling my mum everything cos all she does is just cry and that makes me sad too. She got a lot on her plate and trying to care for my other 8 younger siblings as my dad is no more. I don't know if i can get her forcefully committed to mental home or something. I have been trying to find resources online but I can't. 
She keeps getting fired from her jobs and I told her she needs to check herself and all she says is the coworkers said they can’t work with her that she fine. She has been fired from 4 different jobs signing the last 3 months. She works for a week or so and gets fired.

125,Drugs,"For my 18th birthday, a toxic friend wanted to link. At this time, we are both drug advocates. We would always smoke and do harder drugs like ecstasy and cocaine. I was stoked that I was about snort a bunch of lines and smoke a bunch of weed. I went over there and we smoked( keep in mind I had a 3 month tolerance break). I completely hated the effects of the blunt. I was paranoid, sick, and I acted like an absolute fool. Right then, I decided I didn’t like the cannabis high anymore and I will not be smoking weed anymore. Later that night we snorted ecstasy, molly, and cocaine. It was great in the moment.

126,"Struggling, considering drugs","I'm not a happy guy. Never have been. I live up in a household with an emotionally manipulative mom who drinks too much wine and a dad who was physically there but may as well be a brick wall. They have a dog and he is their kid, I guess. I am just in the way. I get yelled at, hit sometimes, everything is always my fault and I am never good enough. I guess I'm always going to carry that through life.

I've never been good at dealing with emotions. I shut down or I ignore them. Sometimes I want to die, but I'm still here because I'm a coward as well. I think a lot of people can relate to that.
The problem is is I'm vulnerable. I'd form a habit, be it alcohol, drugs or cigarettes if it gave me five minutes of not feeling like I'm a freak wearing someone else's skin who will never amount to anything until the day I die. So I say no. I don't know why. But I've said no so many times people stopped asking.

Whenever I'm offered a drink or a smoke or a hit of whatever, I say no. I make up some bullshit excuse and say no, and I usually lie and say I'm straight edged so they'll leave me alone. It's okay. Still a lie though.

But that's what I am. A liar. I like to square my shoulders and pretend to know what I'm doing.

I'm transgender. I can't come out because of home life and I think I'm depressed as well. I don't know. Even if I was, I'm not allowed to go see a doctor (even though I live in the UK and it's free) because like I said my parents are not... great with my mental health. Last time I asked for help they laughed at me. That shattered my confidence. I'm a few years away from moving out but I have the same freedom as a toddler. They stalk my social media, check my phone, scroll through all my chats and go through my rubbish. I'm writing this on an old phone I'm supposed to have thrown away. And yet we still maintain the appearance of a totally normal family. I don't think my family is normal.

So I don't cope well. I'm not going to kill myself- psyched myself out of that so I guess that's a plus (?)- but I still don't want to be here and I don't really have any healthy coping mechanisms.

And that leads me to drugs and such.

I've always told myself I'd never go that low. But recently my resolve has started to crack and I'm not proud. I have no friends at all. I'm completely isolated. I call 'myself the loneliest whale in the ocean' if I'm being poetic. Which I'm not, because it's pretentious. Music is my only outlet and it just isn't enough against this absolutely crushing weight.

I started looking for ways to get a hold of tranquilizers. I know I'm so sick of feeling, but I also hope that I'm not always going to feel like this. And I know if I start I'll probably regret it. It's just a matter of not starting.

The thing is, the depression isn't always controlled as well. I can feel fine, then all of a sudden it's like a wave that swallows me and I'm underwater feeling a ton weight. It can be days or usually weeks until it lifts and it's tought. I feel like everyone hates me and I suck at everything.

I'm worried about going back to my GP because I don't want to switch my medication from the Citalopram. I'm enjoying the lack of anxiety too much to want to give it up to try something else for my depression which may not work as well for anxiety...it would feel like upsetting the apple cart.

I use alarms and wake up to them, but I don't get out of bed and end up sleeping until like 2 pm. My family gets really frustrated if they need to wake me up because I'll make one of those ""five more minutes"" promises and just sleep for hours longer.

I haven't been in school for the past year or so and haven't had face to face classes since, well, 2020 so my daily schedule hasn't really required me to get up at reasonable hours. I'm going back to school soon, and I won't have my family to (try to) wake me up, so I do really need to get my shit together.

I always mention my sleeping issues to my psychiatrist every session. I've went from 10 mg to 20 mg, though not just for the sedative issues but also for the depression. She says that it's less sedative at higher doses, though I really don't feel it. I'm also currently on immediate release because I was on extended release for some reason. I haven't explicitly talked to my psych about quitting, partially because I don't want to tell her for some reason, and also because nothing can make me sleep if I skip a dose, even other sedative drugs I've tried (don't want to go into that because I already hate being dependant on one drug for sleep), so I can't imagine going days of sleep deprivation to get that out of my system.

Aside from that, I've been recommended to make some lifestyle changes, namely physical activity, even if it's just walking. I've also been told to indulge in my creative hobbies so that there's something I look forward to when I wake up, because I do manage to wake up early on days I have appointments or plans with friends.

I think my sleeping issues are deeply psychological in nature. I don't think about my responsibilities the moment I wake up. I just make excuses for myself to stay asleep. I don't look forward to anything most of the time because I don't exactly enjoy being alive. That's why I get advised to engage in my hobbies, so that there's something I have to enjoy. However, I just feel like once I get up, I need to go brush my teeth and feed myself because I'll feel uncomfortable and nasty if I don't, like I need to do those things before anything else, so I stay in bed to put them off.

I’m seriously considering using drugs and alcohol to distract myself because it has worked in the past and it’s quick and accessible everywhere in college.

139,My mind is lost after a month of drugs and a bad experience,"  

Context: A week ago I tried LSD for the first time, after a month and a half of consuming cannabis daily, frequent alcohol drinking and 3 trips of magic mushrooms. I won’t go into detail about what I felt and thought in the trip, but I will say the following days were very difficult. On Friday, one day after consuming LSD, I cried several times and had some panic attacks, although I could sleep 6 hours that night, next day was very similar, I cried several times, had some panic, and managed to sleep about 6 or 7 hours in the night.

Next day I went camping to the mountains with some friends that were aware of my situation, after walking 8 hours through the mountains we made camp, all day I was anxious and irritable, that night I couldn’t sleep and had some panic attacks, next day we walked about 5 hours under heavy rain, and when we arrived to a road I broke into tears in front of my friends and I told them I had to go back to the city, they were supportive and said it was okay, we walked about 4 hours on the road until we reached a town, and we were very lucky because we happened to coincide with the only bus that leaves for the city only once a day.

After arriving to the city, I texted my dad telling him all that had happened, but instead of saying the LSD happened 4 days prior, I said it had happened 2 weeks before and that I was ok now. That night I couldn’t sleep either and I had a terrible panic attack worse than any other I´ve had, I called a suicide hotline and they told me to go to the emergency room of the nearest hospital and I did, I was in a paranoid state but hopeful I would be treated. After 12 hours of being in the emergency room I was discharged and given a medication so I could sleep the next 4 days, but they suggested I see a doctor in that period. When I arrived home, I took the medicine and slept about 15 hours, the ER doctor called my parents and they got scared because I wasn’t answering the phone. They live in Mexico, I was waiting for their 8am to text them they would get a call from the hospital at their 9am, but I fell asleep before. My sister worried for me got a flight to my city for the next day, she lives in London. 

I went to the doctor already and she told me this was treatable and that she would like to see me the next week, and gave me medicine for the week, this was yesterday.

Now, what I really want to vent about and ask for advice, is about what happened today.

Today it has been 7 days since my bad experience with LSD, after I woke up I was very chill and down to earth, that’s what I thought, but later in the day I had another increase on anxiety when I visited the leprechaun museum with my sister.

It is a 50 minute tour in an enclosed and dark place in a group of around 12 people, and even though this contribute to the anxiety, what really altered me was that in the tour, the guide and storyteller, frequently joked about alcoholism and talked about the “Otherworld” of Irish mythology, and a thought that I have been trying to suppress awoke again, the thought that I have been to that Otherworld already and this lead my mind to wander again in a path that worries me.

A lot of symbols of pre-Christian religions I could see in nature while my mind was under the effects of LSD, I have no doubt that ancient peoples were familiar with the visual effects of this state of mind that the Celts called Otherworld. 

Why does this worry me? Because me, being a spiritual person, am very intrigued to learn more about this, even though I am conscious that I shouldn’t consume substances like this. I am now in a constant struggle to get my feet back on the ground, during my psychedelic trips I have discovered that maybe my mind would like to stay in that state, so when I return to sobriety, I am scared of thinking that, and that maybe if I feed that thought it could become real, and that is what people would call psychosis. 

I do not want to cause pain to my family, I would like to have my mind on earth again, to have earthly objectives and goals, but I find this very difficult. I am seeking for professional and medical help to achieve this, and if possible, uproot this idea. But would that imply to abandon my spiritual and religious beliefs completely? Or maybe I could find and answer on how to live an earthly life in polytheism and I only have to research more. 

I have always been a very obsessive person, and my mind often wanders for a long time in ideas that reach my mind, for example, when I read Treasure Island, I was 1 month thinking about pirates at every single moment of the day. I also remember one time I thought that complex thoughts where the root of mental struggle, and I thought that if I found a way to forget language, I would be happy, when I thought of this I didn’t do any drugs and I wasn’t an alcoholic yet. I discarded this idea after some days of reflection. I suppose the reason I’m scared about my obsessiveness now is that I find myself obsessed with a dangerous idea that involves my sanity and the use of substances that aren’t compatible with me and I should not do them.

After leaving the Leprechaun Museum, my sister noticed that I was lost in my thoughts and asked me if I was feeling well, I thought I just got anxious in such enclosed and dark place. Then she tried to have conversation with me and talk to me about how my doctor appointment went, and she started talking to me about a more positive view on life, I got a little angry as I disagreed with her but this made me feel very guilty because she came to visit me out of worry about what´s happening to me.

143,"recently found out my friend uses drugs, watch me have a mental breakdown in this post","i know this post is tagged as venting but i could use some support too, if anyone is able.

hi yall. i recently found out my friend, who is 16 and was on the closer side of friendship to me, is using drugs. im not sure which drug(s) she uses, but i dont know if im rlly able to be around her comfortably knowing this. i need some sort of solution to my discomfort. i have had some bad experiences with users in the past and im not sure how i feel about her now that i know this.

i dont want to just stop talking to her. thats not fair. but i dont know what else i can concievably do. shes a very nice person. i enjoy her company. but i cant stand to know that she is doing that.

my highschool has a drug problem. almost everyone is addicted to something here. its hard to avoid. i overheard people talking about how they were getting high during the schoolday and how this friend im talking about got so hammered that she threw up everywhere. theyre how i found out what was happening. i overheard all of this in one of my classes and i sit just next to them. i couldnt move because then they would know i was listening, so i just sat there having an anxiety/panic attack (i dont remember which, that day is fuzzy in my mind), along with a lot of zoning out in attempt to block out their conversation.

the whole situation is playing to my trust issues. i have terrible issues with trusting people. its not like she ever directly told me ""i dont do drugs"" and i found out the opposite, it was more of my mental image of her being betrayed. roughly the same thing happened when i found out my aunt on my dad's side is a hardcore conservative (along with my grandparents, but i already knew that, so it didnt have much of an effect when i was directly told that they were). i just wish i had known before i had gotten attatched and i didnt feel betrayed, even though its my own fault for feeling betrayed.

i try my best not to judge other people. i dont know the whole story; maybe she was pressured into it and got addicted. maybe she just does it because she can. maybe its a coping mechanism. i dont know. but either way, its uncomfortable for me. 

i dated someone who smoked weed. she turned out to be very emotionally abusive according to my friends. i suppose as a coping mechanism i attributed it to the weed and how it affected her mind. and i know that notion is unfair, everyone is different and effected differently by marijuana, but it was just ground into me because i stayed with her for six months despite everything she had done to me. i let that be how i see people who smoke weed. and that isnt fair, but i cant help but be uncomfortable.

im also afraid of being dragged into it. that's what my ex had tried to do to me and i guess im attributing all of her behaviors to others. 

i hate myself for judging people. i hate myself for demonizing people. but i cant help it. i guess im traumatized. i dont know. i havent been diagnosed with any trauma, so i dont know if i am. i cant help but feel like a horrible person for judging people on their recreational activities but... what else can i do? am i protecting myself? am i just doing this because im a hateful person? am i traumatized? i dont know. im confused and scared.",1681157721.0,False,2,0,michaledoesthings,None,12hupig,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/12hupig/recently_found_out_my_friend_uses_drugs_watch_me/

149,"Letter to my Self Before Sertraline: Anxiety, PTSD and Drug Hesitancy","*This was originally posted to /mentalhealth, but cross posted to /anxiety and /zoloft. I'll respond for a few days to the original post on /mentalhealth.*



I wanted to post something - as someone who almost never posts on platforms like Reddit - to my past self. The self before Sertraline. I’m embarrassed to say that it feels morally urgent for me to send this transmission out into the world if there’s even a small chance that it will be picked up by someone like me, and that it may help them.

For me, there is no time before PTSD. I grew up in an environment that was very unstable, with a mother exhibiting all the characteristics of a sociopathic narcissist and a father who was drunk by noon. As is typical with people who have PTSD, I don’t feel like talking about it much. Physical, mental and sexual abuse were features of my childhood that have had a long lasting affect on my life. 

Nevertheless, I have done well. Dissociation, and the overactive survival reflex referred to mundanely as GAD, powered me through. After being placed in a special school by some relatives, I thrived. I went to a good university. I went to an even better one after that. I started businesses and volunteer organizations. I felt physically ill walking into a new classroom or workplace, and suicide always lurked in my peripheral vision, but I did it anyway. 

I compensated in a million ways: I read philosophy (the hard kind), self help (the trashy kind) and religious texts (the boring kind). I experimented with diet (after getting into the Black Panthers and the Nation of Islam, I gave up alcohol, meat, dairy), extreme sports and exercise (I can run very far but not very fast). I buried myself in the scholarship of the many outrages and injustices of the world, and I became a radical. I thought that if I knew everything about the darkness that I would be safe from it.

Well, that’s not the way it works. Life is life. It’s banal and you get older. Marcus Aurelius can’t help. Statistically, you and I are at risk. Of heart disease, suicide and addiction, and all sorts of other things, and despite what people will tell you, there isn’t much up side to it. A disability is not a superpower. The pandemic taught me this. The isolation of working from home and living at home built up. I’d shake like a baby bird at the thought of going to the grocery store or the pharmacy — not because of the virus, but because I’d have to be around other people. I’m not sure what I was afraid of.

I had a good therapist at the time (I still have him), and I said: “It angers me that because of some stuff that I had no control over that I am now in a risk category that I do not want to be in. I’m worried of dying early - of the stress and anxiety affecting me physically.” He responded: “You dont think it’s affecting you physically now?” Of course it was.  

Things got worse. I developed a chronic pain condition that as far as I can tell only exists in the mind. There was nothing physically wrong with me. A ball of pain expanded and expanded in my pelvis. Nothing seemed to help. My body started to feel like it was falling apart. 

My first encounter with antidepressants was when I was very young. A doctor tried to put me on them. My young mind was smart enough to realize that it was the environment. I resented the idea (often pushed by my mother) that there was something wrong with me. This insight is probably why I am who I am. I knew better. I was going to get out of there.

So core was this survival-instinct to my identity that at 32, with a thriving business, and an excellent marriage, I could not see how I would make it to 35 alive. I was in agony. Maybe I needed to change my career. Live like a monk. Move to this place or that place. Change everything. I started experimenting with powerful psychedelic drugs. Maybe I could pry open whatever it was that was causing me agony. I went to therapy twice a week. Anything that would help, I did it: another campaign against the invading darkness. No sugar, no alcohol, no fun. But it wasn’t helping. I was getting older, less resilient. 

I started Sertraline after visiting a walk-in clinic doctor in the poorest neighborhood in my city. His clinic had a mandate to not turn anyone away, and despite being a young white person of means, I could not find a doctor that had time for me. I wanted to discuss with a psychiatrist why a urologist had prescribed me benzodiazepine before I took it. “Listen,” the young Sikh doctor said to me, “I get a lot of people in here with PTSD. People who were horribly beaten in their village and fled here because they were accused of stealing a goat. You wouldn't believe it. But I know how to treat it. It’s going to be six to eight months before you see a psychiatrist, but if you’ll trust me, I think this might work.” He wrote me the prescription. 

I am not going to pretend that fate made me take the pills. There were a number of other factors that got me there: feeling like I was at the end of the road with ways to compensate, a close friend who had this same mentality but who gave in and was doing much better, a therapist who correctly diagnosed me after thirty years of suffering, the suggestion from my therapist that even taking placebo would probably help. But I ended up taking Sertraline, and my life changed.

The trouble with trying to convince someone who has anxiety or PTSD to go on drugs is that they will immediately conceive of the million new hells that await them. The longer they think about it, the more hells there are. They’re experts at it. They’re short-circuiting hunters and survivors: they read the landscape for any sign of threat. Real or imagined, it doesn’t matter, they clock it anyway. I do not think that the overcharged analytic mind of someone in the throes of anxiety is much capable of making a decision like that. There’s too much evidence on both sides: maybe the drugs work, maybe they don't, maybe they will but you’ll be brutally maimed. A zombie, or a robot, or a sexless cretin. 

150mg of Sertraline has done more for me than tens of thousands of dollars of talk therapy over these last two decades. It's done more than marathons, and half marathons, and difficult books and easy books, and well meaning mother in laws who ask “have you tried mindfulness?”

It’s done more than just about anything on its own. I feel once again that I have a future, that I am resilient and that I can do whatever it is that I want to do in this life. I no longer feel the weight of mortal or existential dread that has hung over me my entire life, and which seemed to only get worse with each passing year, as if I was one of death's own children. 

I no longer feel a pervading sense of fear, and I want to emphasize this: for virtually my entire life I lived with a pervading sense of fear, and I had no idea what it would feel like to live without it. I thought that was just what being alive felt like. It isn’t. 

Because there is some scared little me (you) out there reading this on a phone in bed late at night, I want to finish out with a few notes about side effects and trade-offs, because there are side effects and trade-offs. But they are well worth it.

First, let’s talk about sex. I’ve found that the relationship between my sex drive and stress has been severed. It used to be that my sex drive would be on steroids when I went through periods of stress. That isn’t the case anymore. I don’t need sex to “get out of my mind.” I subsequently want it way less. The sex that I have, however, is far more pleasurable. In fact, orgasms are, for whatever reason, twice or three times as good. They’re also far harder to induce. I am fine with all of these things. The change is welcome. But yes the difficulty of achieving an orgasm was a bit of a shock at first.

On the way up, I experienced pretty frequent diarrhea. More milligrams go in, more diarrhea comes out. I also experienced a bit of mania. This was the first time in my life that I got a glimpse of what life would be like to live without fear. It’s strange to call the elation that resulted “mania,” but that is most likely the medical term for what I was experiencing. 

Beyond that, the side effects are far superior to living with PTSD and GAD. I get “jolts” at night - a sensation that some people feel occasionally when they are falling asleep, but I get them throughout the night, which is a bit disconcerting for my wife. A weighted blanket has helped calm that down. Sertraline heartburn or acid reflux can be severe. Last night I had to take 8 Tums to get through the night. I cringed when I drank my espresso this morning. But this is rare. Maybe once a month. I could probably give up the espresso, but I won’t. 

The most significant side effect is sleep disruption. I get the night sweats, but I also find it a challenge to get to sleep, and then I usually wake up once or twice throughout the evening (jolts or no jolts). I'm usually relieved when it's morning and I can get up. Despite this, I often feel more awake and alert, and I don’t seem to need as much sleep. It used to be that three or four nights of insufficient sleep would bring on suicidal thoughts. It wouldn't surprise me if the cognitive load of carrying so much anxiety meant that I required more sleep than I do now. 

I will be on this drug for the rest of my life, and thank god for that. We don’t look at a person who uses crutches and say “You’re weak.” We don’t lecture diabetics on their dependence on something that’s made in a lab. I need Sertraline like I need insulin, and I am fairly certain Odysseus did too (and look what happened to him!).

I am a Psychology (MSc) student of the University of Northumbria. I plan to write my thesis focusing on exploring the relationships between barriers to mental health help and substance use, and how toxic masculinity can be a factor of these. **For the purpose of this study, ‘Toxic Masculinity’ refers to the societal expectations that are placed on men, and how this affects their mental health.** 

Previous studies have shown that toxic masculinity can lead to mental health issues and has a positive correlation to substance misuse. What I plan to explore is whether people use substances as an alternative to seeking mental health help and how toxic masculinity plays a role in this.  
If you are male, have a history of substance misuse and have suffered with your mental health, I would very much like to hear your story and be able to add to the current research in regards to the issues highlighted above.

  
Your role will include a semi-structured interview that will take about 30-60 minutes, via Microsoft Teams.

154,Extreme fear of drugs?,"I've been terrified of drugs since I was a kid. For example, when I was little, I would freak out if I saw my parents drinking a glass of wine at dinner. As I've grown up (now 25) I've become desensitized to alcohol and marijuana and have consumed and enjoyed both, but I remain really scared of -- but also obscenely fascinated with -- other addictive substances. If I watch TV shows, movies, or read news articles / memoirs that depict drug use, especially from a personal / anecdotal point of view, I find it really hard to look away, but it gives me nightmares and sometimes full-blown panic attacks, and I can't stop myself from thinking about it. 

As an example, I watched the first episode of ""The Queen's Gambit,"" a show I was excited to watch because of its good reviews and my interest in chess, a couple days ago. I had no idea it had drugs in it. Although it's far from the focus of the show, I can't stop thinking about the depiction of the main character's use of tranquilizers, and have had nightmares centering around it every night since. A year or two ago, I had to stop watching ""This is Us,"" another show I had previously enjoyed, for similar reasons involving a character's substance use. 

I'm so frustrated, because this phobia disrupts my life, causes me so much anxiety, and also stops me from enjoying content I otherwise would/previously did. I also feel really embarrassed about it because a) so much media does include drug use and it's not often disclosed as a trigger warning, so this happens to me a lot, and b) there's literally no reason for me to have this phobia, it's not like I was once a drug user and need to be wary of triggers (which would be a very understandable reason).

The really ironic thing here is that I'm a grad student and am studying addiction for my dissertation because it's so interesting to me. I (very thankfully) don't have issues with reading or writing scientific articles that discuss substance use in a clinical manner, but if they include pictures or anecdotal descriptions, the same thing happens. 

Has anyone else experienced something like this? Also, does anyone know of a database somewhere that tells you what media includes drug use?",1606793170.0,False,1,1,libburn,None,k4ck9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/k4ck9d/extreme_fear_of_drugs/
155,meds and drugs and things,"hey guys, i'm hoping some experienced patients can give me some advice.

please hear me out.

my life is a complete wreck. i'm severely agoraphobic, emetophobic, and i have terrible anxiety as a result. 

my past psych diagnosed me with PTSD and GAD, as well as my phobias.

life is complete trash. i'm unable to do anything.

a couple years ago i got fired because i stopped coming into work. i was having a bad episode and i literally couldn't leave my house. i then had a complete breakdown. my wife contacted my employer and explained the situation, and that i was getting treatment. two weeks later, i got fired.

i've avoided dentists almost all my life because i'm really scared of intrusive medical procedures. result: my dental health is fucked. right now i need about $30,000 in dental work to restore everything.

after years of searching and trial and error, i finally found a dentist willing to code and bill everything through our BCBS medical insurance--final cost out of pocket would be about 9,000, which is manageable.

or it would have been if i could have went to the appointment. i was scheduled for the first 3 extractions (14 total) to make way for the implants, and i lost it. i couldn't leave the house. i got up, i got dressed, and i froze at the door. i tried and tried but i couldn't move. 

so, they fired me. they cut me loose and told me they couldn't afford patients who wasted their time.

then we found a nice dentist in mexico who'd do the job cash for $13,000. it seemed nice. there was a nice hotel nearby, plus complimentary transportation to and from the clinic.

it would have worked out great--if i'd been able to get on the plane.

i froze on my way out the door. had to cancel the plane tickets and reservations and everything.

ditto for my Lasik. i went to the consultation and had a panic attack when the doctor told me ""we have to make sure you're right for Lasik or PRK. your eye could explode if we do the wrong procedure."" boom. shaking, sweating, dizziness...i almost fainted in the bathroom.

but i told myself i was going to be brave this time and go through with it. they were having a special for $1600 for both eyes, so we booked it.

the day of, i froze at the door. they were understanding. we rebooked for a month later.

then i froze at the door again.

all day, at least 30-40 times a day, my body is out of control. i shake, i sweat, i have racing thoughts, i have night terrors, i wake up with panic attacks, and i always assume the worst is going to happen. 

i feel like my body is a semi truck and i'm in the driver's seat, but i'm flying downhill with no brakes or steering. it's a complete loss of control. my body feels like a prison. i'm trapped inside it.

i can't run from it, but i can't live inside it. 

i live with so much pain. my dental pain, my lower back pain, and my weight gain (i'm 6'2 and used to be about 185...over the years i've gotten to about 205). i can't exercise because my pounding heart and sweating feels just like a panic attack, so it actually makes me have a panic attack. 

i know what i need and want to do. i know i have to take care of myself, but i'm trapped between the knowing and the fearing.

i always say ""my brain is logical, but my body is ignorant"". in other words, self-talk doesn't help at all. i know my fears are irrational, but breathing slowly and talking to myself doesn't help anymore. 

i've tried deep breathing, aromatherapy, meditation, etc....it just doesn't work for me. 

this is the story of my life.

&#x200B;

weddings, birthdays, parties, bbqs, family get-togethers, work events, job interviews, vacations...you name it, i've avoided it. i've lost many friends and missed many great things because of it.

most days i have to psych myself up for a trip to the post office, the grocery store, or even the gas station. sometimes it's hard getting into the shower. 

i just turned 40, and this has been going on since about the age of 10. i somehow survived school (with plenty of horror stories to remember), and i got my BA online. graduated first in my class, actually. i was so good that after reading my senior thesis and my literary contributions to the school anthology, plus hearing all the praise from my professors, the dean of the English college suggested i get my master's and come back to interview for a full-time teaching position at my alma mater. 

but of course i couldn't handle being on campus all day. another potential career path down the shitter.

this is the story of my life.

&#x200B;

one good thing: i'm a voice actor now, so i can work from my little home studio. at least i have some direction. i'm not famous enough to get cast in commercials or shows, but i do all right.

of course, i can't have a youtube channel because i'm too scared of being judged by others, but it is what it is.

i can't get on disability because my wife's income is too high. apparently if your spouse grosses--not nets--a certain amount, you're not allowed to be officially disabled. so i can't quality for a service dog either.

so almost nobody takes me seriously. i'm just a ""a guy with mental problems"". not a disability patient. 

despite the fact that i've never been in trouble with the law, i've never been dangerous or a self-harmer, and i've never hurt anyone. i'm just not messed up enough--physically--to be granted special needs status.

funny how my cousin has a tiny little limp--he doesn't even need a cane most days--and he's on full disability, with full benefits, and everyone treats him like he's lucky to be alive today. 

but me? forget it. i'm just a jerk. i'm just the guy who ""ditches everyone"". i'm just ""selfish"". 

this is the story of my life.

&#x200B;

so, after years of therapy, CBT, EMDR, hypnotherapy, biometric feedback, and all the rest, i've decided that drugging myself is the only remaining choice. 

hell, i'm confident that if i weren't emetophobic, i'd probably be a raging alcoholic. anything to numb the pain and maybe have some kind of social life. so i guess that's one little positive side to all this mess.

i'm actually looking forward to getting drugs. if the other methods haven't worked, maybe medicating myself into oblivion will. i'd rather be brain foggy than scared. 

maybe it'll chill me out and help me become the type of person i envy and admire: relaxed, mellow, chill, and not too concerned about tomorrow. balanced. cool. serene. even if it makes me a little dumb or slows down my thoughts, hey, i'm cool with that. i think i'd rather have slower thoughts and be relaxed than live with the chaotic mess that my mind is every day.

&#x200B;

so i'm curious about other people's experiences. 

after doing research, i've concluded that gabapentin, propanolol, or Lyrica (pregabalin) might work for me. 

i've heard that gaba and Lyrica give many people a sense of euphoria and calmness, or at least stabilize their moods and help them react in a more calm, balanced way. 

i've also heard that propanolol literally slows down your physical reactions; i.e., situations that would normally get your heart pounding and your chest hurting and your sweat pouring are more manageable, because you don't get the familiar old ""physical panic"" symptoms. 

so you can learn to deal with things you previously feared, because you're able to break the ""panic habits"". and thus, get help by exposure therapy and relearning to deal with life without being frightened and nervous.

&#x200B;

i can't take Xanax or Valium every day. i take them occasionally--though more occasionally lately than usual--but i hear they lose effectiveness pretty fast, and you have to keep upping the dose to get the same effect. 

word round the campfire is, stuff like gabapentin and Lyrica are better for long-term management. 

i was on Prozac at the age of 19, and i felt so dead inside that i could barely get out of bed. i had no sex drive, i was dizzy all the time, and i felt like i was living 2 feet underwater all the time. 

i can't take SSRIs because i can't deal with impotence. my sex life is just about the only thing that brings me any relief or happiness, and it's just about the only thing i can do that doesn't disappoint my wife, who's also bearing the brunt of all this stress and disappointment and despair.

i can't give up our sex life. it's the only thing i have that still belongs to me. it's the only thing that still helps me feel some slight shred of sanity and sameness. it's one thing that i can cling to, something she and i share. something that still feels safe and fun.

&#x200B;

i'd really love to hear details about other people's experiences with these drugs, and also about other drugs that helped quell--or at least quiet--anxiety and help them live more balanced, normal lives.

my life is calling me, guys. i've already missed so much. i missed being at the hospital when my sister's first child was born (hospitals scare me), i missed my mom's 65th birthday, and even driving long distances on the highway is enough to make me avoid going someplace. 

my life is passing me by, and i'm taking my poor wife along on this distressing and destructive ride too. i need to help myself and end this madness and guilt. 

&#x200B;

please share your thoughts. thank you. 

&#x200B;

TL;DNR, i have crushing phobias and anxiety that utterly destroy my life and make me a nervous wreck every single day. i'm considering gabapentin, propanolol, or Lyrica to help me manage my symptoms so i can get back to living a more balanced, happy life without terror, and SSRIs probably aren't the best choice for me, so i'm hoping experienced patients will be kind enough to share their thoughts, feelings, and views.",1613552093.0,False,0,2,sharkpickles,None,llq3ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/llq3ww/meds_and_drugs_and_things/

159,drugs and alcohol,I’m 16 and for probably around 3 years now I’ve just been using drugs and alcohol to cover up any issues i find in life. when i was around 10/11 i started hearing voices. I would hear family members and people talking when no one was there or just hearing random noises that just couldn’t be real. But it confused me because what if they were real. Then i began hearing these different voices. That are there constantly. They put me down and insult me and make me very paranoid. A lot of other mental health problems were going on that i’m not going to go into any detail about on here but i began using unhealthy coping mechanisms. It started with just smoking weed but then it moved onto regular cocaine use and pills and lots and lots of alcohol. I’ve only ever really drank straight spirits. Ill go through a litre bottle or more every time i drink and i mix it with nothing. By the time i was 14 i’d been cutting or burning myself for a about 5 years and eventually last year people found out. Then i opened up about everything except the drug and alcohol use and they seemed like they wanted to help me. But then everything got out of hand and i was in and out of hospital for alcohol related issues and psychosis brought on by the drugs and alcohol. And then all the support stopped. They blamed everything on the drugs and alcohol and still won’t believe that the issues were there before. I admit that the drugs and alcohol most likely made me a lot worse but the issues have always been there. It’s so frustrating trying to make them believe me that the drugs or the alcohol are just coping mechanisms i use and the use of them is because of the mental issues I suffer and not the cause.

163,"Dungeons, Dragons, Drugs and Depression","The holiday season can be a particularly challenging time for many people all across the globe, so I figured it’s about time I finally shared my personal journey on the mental health strugglebus. Unlike my other articles this one won’t include a clean and concise list of bullet-point takeaways, because it has been anything but. However I do hope that you find something worthwhile in the following text whether it be acknowledgment that your struggles are valid and that you’re not alone in how you feel, a continued hope for light at the end of the tunnel, a rekindling of your connection to the RPG community, or even just to get to know me (Aaron, The Alpine DM) a little bit better as a fellow human being.

I can’t tell you exactly when it started, but for the longest time I felt like I wasn’t present in my own life. It wasn’t all thunderclouds and rainstorms; in fact from the outside it probably *seemed* like everything was perfect. Loving and supportive family? Check. A handful of close friends? Check. Academic success? Checkity Check. 

Yet there was an inescapable apathy deep within myself that I couldn’t seem to shake or explain. As fucked up as it seems, there were days when I wished a horrific tragedy upon myself. At least then, I told myself, I would have some justification for feeling this way.

It wasn’t that I wanted to die. I just didn’t particularly want to live. 

In 9th grade I got introduced to Dungeons and Dragons 3.5e through my brother and some of our mutual friends from LaserTag. After spending 45 minutes laughing non-stop at how ridiculous and silly the entire premise was, it finally “clicked” and I understood the appeal. It was like playing some of my favorite video game RPGs but there weren’t any restrictions on what I could try, and I got to enjoy the story with friends.

These Friday nights became a sort of safe haven that I looked forward to greatly. There was no need to hide my nerdy interests or shy-away from the weirdo that I truly was. Naturally I didn’t openly talk about this at school because, being 14, I was concerned with trying to be popular and kiss a girl. I’m not sure where I picked it up (*mainstream media in 2008? idk)* but it was ingrained in my head that ‘Dungeons and Dragons is for hopeless losers. God forbid I associate myself with that publicly. 

Fast forward a few years and along came drugs. It was like a light-switch turned on, “*Holy shit… I feel great.”* I’ll gloss over some major details but I quickly became addicted to the thrill of pushing myself to the limit –  mentally, physically, and emotionally – just to see if I could get away with it. The best way to describe it is like speeding down the highway and closing your eyes while taking your hands off the wheel (Yes I’ve done this…please don’t be like me). You know everything will *probably* be fine, but there’s the distinct possibility that things could go catastrophically wrong at any second. However I was willing to take that risk because feeling *SOMETHING* seemed a whole lot better than the emptiness I had grown accustom to. 

Annyyyywaaay…I wound up in the hospital (and this wouldn’t be the last time either) and got the fancypants diagnosis of polysubstance abuse. Now what exactly does that mean? Basically that I wanted to be fucked up all the time and didn’t care how, or alternatively it “*refers to a type of substance dependence disorder in which an individual uses at least three different classes of substances indiscriminately and does not have a favorite drug that qualifies for dependence on its own.*“

In college the pressure to “be cool” grew stronger than ever, but so did my yearning to once again play Dungeons & Dragons and feel comfortable in my own skin. For whatever reason I felt deeply ashamed of my love for the hobby and kept it hidden from virtually everyone.

Sure the non-stop crazy partying was a lot of fun (*cue more ER visits…*), but I wasn’t doing myself any favors in the mental health department. I could barely get out of bed in the morning and drag myself to class – in fact many days I didn’t. Just thinking about existing and interacting with the world was completely draining. “*How do all of these people do this every single day?”,* I distinctly remember thinking to myself.

I found some solace by hiding away in my room and rolling up different characters that I came up with. With these characters I would go on adventures, get into barfights, and explore randomly generated dungeons (all by myself of course). Eventually I was enthralled by the idea of *actually* playing again and decided to check out some posts in [r/lfg](https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/). I continued to completely hide the fact that I was interested in playing D&D, despite now actually meeting up with people to play it regularly. Admittedly it was weird to meet up with complete strangers and start a campaign, but everyone turned out to be awesome people and it reminded me of why I loved playing D&D so much in the first place.

Despite this, things went downhill pretty quickly after graduating from college. Staying up until 4am railing lines of coke and downing bottles of champagne. By myself. Only to wake up and do a few more lines before heading to work. While avoiding something I was passionate about I had inadvertently became that which I was trying to avoid. I had become a hopeless loser.

It didn’t take too long to realize I was plummeting towards rock bottom, so I quickly started cleaning up my act and decided to move across the country for a new job. It wasn’t an easy or perfect process but through mindfulness practice, plenty of water and exercise, help from a professional, and of course slaying dragons, I was able to get myself back on the right track. Shortly after, I found a new D&D group full of awesome players and was inspired to create this website. 

Could all of this have been avoided if there wasn’t such a (perceived) stigma against Dungeons & Dragons and discussing mental health? Sure, maybe. Regardless, this hobby has repeatedly connected me with new friends and continually gives me something to look forward to.

I feel this way because alcohol is so much more widely accepted because it is legal. It seems like most people tend to think of alcoholics as “people who just made some mistakes” whereas drug addicts are viewed as “low life losers who will never amount to anything.” I hate the stigma that surrounds drug use. It makes me feel guilty and terrible when I think about my past actions. People also seem to feel sorry for me, in a pitiful way. Almost as if they think that I am just stupid or a horrible person.

170,"Is there anything, other than drugs, that could get me out of depression?","To clarify, I'm soon turning 15 and am pretty sure I'm moderately/severly depressed.

So  I'm not actually 100% sure why I'm depressed. However I was an outcast  my whole life and barely got any attention or acceptance from people at  all. This is still pretty much the case. At one point I even wished I  was depressed, because stupid me thought that this would make people  accept me and give me the attention I was craving. I was obviously  wrong. This all happened about when I started puberty at around 13.

Now  here we are. I'm on the verge of crying daily. Not all the time, but  commonly. And there is nothing I can do about it. Even when I have a  ""good moment"". Even when I'd normally be happy, the sadness just won't  go away. I'm also not motivated to do anything at all. It takes hours  for me to get out of bed by my own force, and when I do, I quickly lose  interest in the reason I even went out of bed. There are also a lot of  other things such as memory loss and self hatred but I feel like it  would be unnecessary to go into detail.

My  question is: If people suddenly accept me, give me the attention I was  always craving for, would my depression actually go away? I'm not sure  about this because short-term affection does not help at all, however  I'm not sure if long-term affection would do the trick. I'm not sure if  anything than stuff like antidepressants or other drugs would help. All I  beg for you guys is to be as honest as possible, even if the truth is  dark.

171,My friend plans to use her prescibed drugs to end herself. Is it possible?,"I posted this on r/depression too, but I think making another here would increase the chance of me finding something useful.

My friend was diagnosed with severe depression four or five years ago. She tried therapy and was given meds but that seems not to work as things only got worse. She attempted suicide multiple times and all failed. Now she refuses to take therapy sessions and frequently cuts her meds as a form of self-harm.

Earlier this year she went to Sydney, Australia, supposedly for college but it was actually for her to end herself without any hindrance. She would've done that if it was not for her boyfriend who travelled a very far distance to meet her. But he had to return to his home country to study and things have gotten worse for her since. Her worsened condition allows her to be prescribed with stronger drugs, which she claims to be using to either put her in an unconscious state or to end herself, either by overdose or by using a drug cocktail. Her university has a vending machine that she can get drugs from, which she claims to be using to attempt suicide by overdosing.

She currently doesn't have any close friends or guardians with her. I really want to help her, so I want to ask?

1. Is it possible to die from overdosing of depression meds?

2. Are there any known drug cocktails with depression meds that can kill?

3. Do medicine vending machines in Australia allow a person to buy enough meds to kill themselves?

172,drug induced psychosis?," 

So i'll just lay it all out and you guys can have a read and let me know if you ever experienced something similar or know what have might happened with me.

I had a friend send me a wax pen, but with my lack of knowledge about the pen I thought it was weed (THC+CBD) I didn't know much about the ratios of weed etc and clearly didn't know wax pens was just THC concentrate. So this one night I had 2 hits of that wax pen. Next thing i know I am in my bed, don't remember getting there at all, don't remember if i woke up, I was so confused. I felt so so heavy and couldn't move. My eyes were rolling back and I could feel my body shake as if i was consciously convulsing. I couldn't do anything about it, focusing was so hard and say I focused for 10 sec, I would ""lose control"" for about 1 min. My eyes were hurting from how much they'd move around uncontrollably, my jaw was also acting weird as if i was biting onto nothing non stop; that also hurt pretty bad. At this point I had no time perception at all but it felt like a while, I was hurting from my eyes rolling back, convulsing, and my jaw was sore asf. I kept losing it when my eyes would roll back and ""coming back"" mentally when my eyes were okay, so some bits and pieces I still to this day don't understand because i simply can't remember it all. I also remember tasting blood, so i figured i had bit my tongue while convulsing; at one point it was so bad I felt the blood inside my mouth pooling up and i coughed it out. I don't remember how i managed to get my best friend on the phone but i did and she tried talking to calm me down and next thing i know is me ""waking up"" with a 5hr phone call still on. I told her i felt better (still HELLA confused) I opened my window and realized I remembered coughing the blood so i got the washroom and looked at my face/tongue but everything was fine, ran to my bed and still, no sign of blood. I was so confused, I had felt, seen & tasted the blood. I could still taste blood in my mouth, but like i said nothing was there.

Later on during the day I called my friend again and asked her what had happened, because clearly some of it was all in my head and i had hallucinations of some sort; she told me she could hear me trembling/convulsing, she heard my teeth shattering, heard me cry and told me it had lasted for about 3hrs before I fell asleep. So I figured the convulsing, the teeth shattering, eye rolls, not being able to move was all real. So all of that for a total of 4 hours (tried to deal with it alone for 1hr before calling her).

For the following days my time perception was shit, my logic was out the window, I was so confused all the time, I heard voices but those i'm not sure if that was actually me thinking to myself or if they were actual voices in my head. I wouldn't realize i was speaking when I was, I would only realize I spoke once my dialogue was over and often times I didn't know if I actually spoke or if i only thought whatever was ""said"" (super confusing i know and I'm sorry idek how to explain all this) I was making stupid decisions that I know I never would have made. Couldn't focus at ALL (someone would ask me a simple question and I'd dose off). For some reason I also had a fixation with the color red; If i saw something red while i was speaking/walking or literally doing anything, I'd just freeze and look at it. I would also get the feeling of ""clicking back into reality"" a whole lot during the day, and it would scare me a lot because if i was ""clicking back"" where the hell was I right before? I know this might be a little weird to understand so here's an example: I was chilling in my room and next thing i know i'm outside playing with my dog; I couldn't remember getting there at all or since when I had gotten there. I was also contemplating ending it all very seriously for a good 2 days in the first week al this happened (I am not like that at all, so i was very scared of myself so I had a friend watch me for those 2 days). I also seriously thought i was going crazy, lowkey pretty fucking scared. All of those symptoms lasted for about 1 month and eventually died off.

This whole thing was around 1 year ago and I feel totally fine now. Stopped smoking pot completely and only stick to edibles which for some odd reason seem to work better for me; I don't have badtrips at all.

My question is, have this type of badtrip ever happen to you? A couple friends told me I was experiencing a drug induced psychosis so i figured i'd ask others on this thread.

Iv always had extreme anxiety and social phobias however the dp/dr is making me feel like I’m going to lose my shit and only came up about last year. I’m aware of what’s happening, it feels like I’m observing everything outside of myself watching someone else live my life through a computer screen , also as if I don’t exist and I’m stuck in a perm high. I’m constantly shivering and numb because of my anxiety, tense and over thinking leading to panic attacks. Yesterday I decided to quit smoking and this it the worst it has ever been but it consists everyday. I cannot exercise bc I have an eating disorder and my anxiety keeps me from being able to eat even though I’m starving. I hardly ever consume anything other than water and protein bc I cannot eat fruits or vegetables for the life of me. 

I had a spiritual awakening a few months ago that really had worsened this symptom. I came to a realization that everything is imaginary and only consists of consciousness. Because of this I truly understand I’m not truly real, and none of you are too. But that doesn’t change the reality I’m experiencing as I type this, im still here, but I’m not. Let me give you an example. I understand that my hand is not actually my hand, it’s just a hand and the thought of it being mine is only a thought or perception. In the same way the thought you exist is only a thought, and you or (I) don’t truly exist i or my ego is only another thought of my imagination. What the fuck am I gonna do please help. 

Iv tried anti depressants before, they do not work for me and I do not wish to be on them the rest of my life. I understand big pharma is a scam and my doctors don’t even understand everything to properly diagnose me. My brain sometimes goes blank, I can hardly form a thought unless it’s intrusive. The only thing I have found to help me with my anxiety is simply taking a hot bath but that’s not enough and I can’t take a bath anywhere at any time let alone more than once a day.  Iv been depressed for a few years but after my spiritual awakening I had hope I could recover for the first time with my depression. My depression has only gotten worse because I can’t live my life or do anything that used to be exciting to me because everything seems to give me anxiety.

I did not really want to go but i was tired and pretty out of it, so i said no. He kept trying to get me to take an uber with him, i said im good multiple time, but he was persistent and i eventually caved. I believe he gave me some ketamine at some point and i went to bed, he woke me up and said do key bump, which likely the ketamine. I ended up being blindfolded and tied up, my body was too weak to do anything and i could not move my limbs. I remember feeling like he stuck me with a needle by my butt, but i was too incapacitated and also bound/blindfolded. I felt like he was humping me and i ended up feeling water running down my leg. At some point they tried to get me to do another bump, which i said i would do knowing something was wrong, he put the key to my nose and i blew it off the key. They must have known things where going south, so i believe they re-injected me. I woke up later and accused him of raping me, he said he didnt, but he wanted to do the coke. I was very confused and out of it, so i did the coke and it woke me up. I ended up locking the door and pulled the sheet off the mattress and found the wet stop. He broke in the door and his friend ended up chocking me out and put me back on the bed. I woke back up more confused and the earlier memories had faded. He got me to do more blow, I tried to reenter the room, but he said not to go in there and the door was locked. We eventually went back to the same room and the bed was on the other side of the room (earlier before i was drugged i asked by the headboard was on the other side of the room), now the bed was on the side with the headboard. I believe the whole thing was premeditated and someone implied they were my stalkers. I dont really know what to do about the situation, i am going to talk to the police at my college who are going to submit my report.

185,Cognitive Dysmorphia and the use of recreational drugs?," 

What do you think about this?

In  short, that some people (including me) use recreational drugs and  supplements, solely because they feel like their cognitive functions are  only as they should be while on these substances, even tho they do not  suffer from cognitive illnesses or decline?

Like  I feel ""normal"" only when I take speed/adderall, even tho I decidedly  don't have ADHD, but I finally feel ""sharp"" again as I was in highschool  (I am 28m). On the other hand, even tho I have no symptoms of anxiety, I  only feel like I am truly relaxing when on benzos or something similar  and sleep properly just as a kid (you know, when nearly nothing can get  you up and you have those deep lucid dreams and wake up refreshed).

I  have tried for years other methods. Working out regularly, sleep  hygiene, a perfect diet, minor supplements... and you know what? I feel  great and healthy, happy and relaxed, but just not that sharp or that  relaxed/deep sleep, like on those marginally harder substances.

186,How do you get rid of someone else’s drugs?,"My son has quite a few drugs in his house. It’s mostly mild stuff like magic mushrooms, acid, and weed. The thing is, he has schizophrenia and it’s really not recommended to use drugs with the disorder and especially not recommended to mix the drugs with the medication. 

We were over at his house grabbing some stuff (he’s staying with me right now) and I saw he had a whole bunch of stuff. Under normal circumstances it wouldn’t be a big deal. He’s 21, he’s an adult and a college student. I don’t care all too much if he wants to try that stuff as long as he’s safe and not doing anything too bad. His mother was a hippie so I’ve seen it all before. 

I just am at a bit of a loss on what I should do with the drugs. I don’t want them in my house, but I don’t know if I trust him not to do them and get rid of them himself.

187,"After 6 years of opioids use, it has been 3 weeks since I quit and I need a short period of drug use to improve my depression and anxiety and motivation to continue living and get better... Please read my conditions and according to my problems, suggest me drug, so that I can consult with my doctor","I am 30 years old and as I said, it has been 3 weeks since I quit opioids and especially methadone after 6 years of continuous daily use.

Since I was 16-17 years old, I had the problem of self-confidence and anxiety when facing girls, and I have a normal look, but I always see myself ugly in my mind and I had high standards, that it still remains in my mind.

In the first few years of using opioids, most of my problems were greatly reduced, but it was somehow false and deceitful and as time passed, my condition got worse, and now I am worse than ever.

In the last 8 years, I used to make all my living expenses from poker, but now I lost all my money and my bad mental condition caused this heavy loss, so it has a very bad effect on my life and I don't want to play for a while and get better and I want to try to devote my time to other things (in the last 5-6 years I only used drugs and played poker, at least 35 hours a week)

Now I really feel that I need something foreign like a drug or a combination of two drugs with low side effects and to be used for a short period of at most one year for my problems (I really have very little trust in these drugs and I don't want to use them all my life or for many years)

So:

Depression

Anxiety

Lack of motivation

I feel hopeless

I don't feel happy

Fear of communicating with strangers and crowded places, especially girls

It has become more difficult for me to talk and communicate with people now

Lack of self confidence

Lack of enthusiasm and motivation to the extent that it is difficult for me to wake up and get out of bed

Severe overthinking and negative thoughts (my mind is like a highway of negative and even ridiculous thoughts and it is all in the future and the past and different thoughts and many times I can't shut it up and I keep jumping from one thought to another) which has also caused my lack of concentration and focus

Almost my mind is constantly thinking and i am not at the moment

Unpleasantness (maybe anhedonia) and not enjoying the things that used to give me pleasure

Very empty, meaningless and aimless thoughts of seeing life and continuing it

Probably extremely nihilistic thoughts towards life and feel very dark about life

I have no hope for life and future

Somehow I hate myself and what I have become (i made) in these years and I need a big change

I feel that I cannot express my true self and for a long time I imprisoned or limited my true self or parts of myself due to the fear of expressing myself and somehow my outside and inside are not the same and I am not comfortable and free

I should also add that the center where I went to quit methadone replaced me with buprenorphine, and I took it for a few months and reduced the dose, and it's been 3 weeks since I stopped taking it.

There was also a psychiatrist there who prescribed Escitalopram 10mg and Aripiprazole 5mg a month ago for me, but I want to go to a doctor who I think has more experience and knowledge and I went to him before.

It is also important that I have been taking clonazepam 1mg  every night for about 12 years, and after all these years of use, I think that many of my problems can be caused by this pill, but really, quitting this pill is even more mentally difficult for me than quitting opioids and I am sure and I heard that it can be very hard and painful withdrawals.

But with all of this, maybe it's too late, but almost for the first time in my life, I seriously want to try to get better and improve and live a proper life.",1704477641.0,False,2,1,_shpongled,None,18zd42k,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/18zd42k/after_6_years_of_opioids_use_it_has_been_3_weeks/
188,Scared To Try Drugs Again,"\*\*Disclaimer: I'm using a brand-new Reddit account for this post, I and don't want to share too many details that might identify me. Please bear with me in this regard. I'm desperate for advice - even (especially?) from strangers - since none of the in-person ""wisdom"" I've received (including that from my therapist, who I see 3-4 times a month) is helpful beyond ""you need to do something about this"".\*\*

I'm a 30-something female who has 3 jobs and lives/struggles with manic depression (otherwise known as bipolar disorder). My depressive states involve crying jags, calling in sick to work, fantasizing about how I might die, failing to follow basic hygiene, and other unpleasant behaviors. My manic states range from cocaine-like highs and wonderful creativity/productivity to agitation/aggression to impulsive/dangerous behavior that causes me to lose friends, money, health, and sleep. For both depression and mania, my biggest triggers are departure from routine and sensing major changes in the near future.

I've tried five different psychiatric drugs over the years (Trileptal, Zoloft, Cymbalta, Effexor XR, and Latuda - in that order). The difficult-to-terrifying side effects these medications produced within me - along with the debilitating withdrawal symptoms I experienced from the Effexor XR - are only slightly outweighed by the fact that they either did nothing to help me with my depression and mania or instead ""flattened me out"" so much that I was fake and emotionless. As a result of my experiences, I've been unmedicated for nearly five years now (with the exception of one horrifying day on Latuda in 2018). None of the psychiatrists I've seen have taken psychiatric medication themselves, and my despair over hellish side effects and withdrawal has historically been ignored or disbelieved by them. They all seemed to be throwing darts instead of making conscientious decisions about my medication. 

After a series of panic attacks and breakdowns (including a three-hour one at an international airport in November), I decided in December that I needed to re-consider medication. But now I'm regretting my decision to schedule my psychiatric evaluation (which happens a week from today and will take place with the same shrink who prescribed me Latuda). What's the point in going to this evaluation, I ask myself? I'm a religious person, and I believe that God made me this way. Why fight my identity with chemicals? It's no different to me than injecting chemicals into my eyes to change their color. It's spitting in God's face, really. Why should I hate myself so much that I drug it out of existence? Life with manic depression is painful enough without having to take expensive pills that dull who I am every day.

I just have no clue how to approach this situation. I think of suicide on a regular basis, and my entire life has spun out of control. I seem to have no command over my libido, organization and neatness, health, or moods. And it's well-understood that if I tell the wrong person about how I'm feeling (like I did a few times in the past), I'll get imprisoned against my will in a mental institution..causing me to lose my employment/income/sense of hope, get saddled with a massive hospital bill that will send me further back into the crushing debt I'm currently clawing my way out of, and get worse due to being surrounded by people who are even crazier than I am. 

I know I'm unwell, but I've got all these reservations about trying drugs again. Please advise me with reason and compassion. I'm willing to answer questions that don't reveal my identity.

So anyway I met up with her at the bar on New Year's Eve and I remember ordering one drink and then after that I couldn't remember anything else that happened. Did could only remember waking up the next day at my friend's house. When I woke up the next morning I saw where I had sent my fwb texts messages.

I can't maintain a relationship without letting my mental health affect and drag it down. I won't commit to working towards the career I dream of.

202,"Unbearable Paranoia + Drugs, My History","Uh well hello, this is my first post on reddit and i’m here because i don’t really know who to ask about this. So background here, i’m currently a senior at my local highschool, and i have a slight history of mental health issues. Basically, when i was 12 i was cutting myself and pretty suicidal, same deal at 13, parents didn’t help, when they found out about it they screamed at me about it (don’t really want to go into detail there), and once a little more time had passed they constantly tried to get me alone to talk about it, so i was pretty wary of being alone with them, like literally we’d be in a car and they’d pull off into a parking garage and start asking me about stuff, which of course, i didn’t want to talk about, highly uncomfortable, verge of tears the whole time blah blah blah. So, concurrently with all of this, i had gotten into creepy pasta, like super into it. Which was, not great for a 12 year old. I was, constantly paranoid to say the least, i could not be on my own for at all, for even a minute, literally, even if there were other people in the building. i thought that everywhere i looked there would be some horrible monster waiting to kill me, i was scared to close my eyes when i washed my hair in the shower, for the fear that when i opened them there would be something horrible in front of me, i wouldn’t even look in mirrors because i was afraid of seeing something standing behind me. day and night, just, debilitatingly scared, of everything. i thought doors would lock, i thought rooms would fill with water. I would see things out of the corner of my eye, like borderline hallucinate. I genuinely thought i was about to be killed every almost waking moment of every day for about a year or two. i don’t know if that’s normal, i’d be very curious to know everyone’s experiences with that. Anyways, then in highschool, at 15, i started using drugs, i smoked weed, i drank, i snorted or swallowed pills, i dropped acid, and i took mushrooms. I did all of those things several times, but none of them became a habit except the weed (which i’ve been sober from for a little over two months). never got help from parents quitting when they found out, i got yelled at, and physically abused a bit, which was probably warranted. I also got fucked with kind of a lot. Starting in eighth grade i got random phone calls and texts, people trying to make me think that girls liked me and shit like that. it got worse in high school, some girl spread rumors about me (i don’t know exactly what she said, but from what i understand she made it sound like i sexually harassed/ assaulted her, which i absolutely did not) that she later apologized for, but by then the damage was done, lots of people hated me (and still hate me) because of the things she said, which made me paranoid of people, i couldn’t tell what they had heard about me, I felt like people looked at me differently but i couldn’t be sure, and i obviously couldn’t ask them. Then I did something that i’m not proud of, I cheated on a “girlfriend” of mine, once, and she blocked me a month or two later (i guess she had found out), when i confronted her face to face, she said her parents checked her phone and got her in trouble, which i believed, but she called a friend and laughed about it saying she couldn’t believe how dumb i was for believing her, i confronted her a second time, same thing, lies, then she called her friend and made fun of me. since all of this, i’ve gotten calls in the middle of the night from people i don’t know, talking shit to me or trying to make me believe that they’re people i know they’re not, people messaging me on instagram and trying to get me to talk shit about the girl i cheated on (people who i know are close to her), voice messages from people calling me a rapist, her and her friends contact girls i try to date and tell them all sorts of horrible things about me. they’ve ruined relationships and friendships. which has made me (surprise) even more paranoid of people, i have a hard time trusting people because i don’t know what they’ve heard about me. I have maybe two friends, who, don’t make time to hang out with me, constantly blow me off, and don’t like spending time with me. I have a girlfriend who knows most of these things (not the drug use) and seems to accept me for it, but because of the situation surrounding us getting together i’m incredibly stressed about not knowing if i’m happy with her. and i have a million things to do for school and college applications.

The reason I took the sip of wine also makes me anxious. It’s because I was crying. When I saw the alcohol my hand just reached for it and I took a sip without a moments hesitation.

207,Why do *almost* all drugs give me panic attacks?,"This is a question I have wanted to ask for so long, but I don't know who to ask. I apologize if this isn't even the best subreddit to post in. Basically I have been sober for over a year because whenever I feel the effects of almost any mind altering substance, I get severe panic attacks and dissociative episodes. These panic attacks will come on as soon as I feel ""not sober"" and they will come and go for days or weeks afterwards. This has happened to me with weed, alcohol, prescription pain killers, and even anxiety medication. The only exceptions being caffeine and nicotine, but even those have similar effects at high doses. Before I went sober I was a heavy weed smoker (3.5g a day) but these problems have carried on far after quitting weed,. Being completely sober (minus nicotine and caffeine) is the only way I've found to stop my constant panic attacks. This isn't really a huge issue for me as I don't mind living a sober lifestyle, but I am very afraid of accidentally eating edibles or jell-o shots now haha. My biggest fear in the back of my mind is that I know I have to get my wisdom teeth taken out soon, and I am absolutely terrified about the painkillers I will probably not be able to take after the procedure. Does anyone have a similar experience or advice?",1603337384.0,False,2,5,subduedshrimp,None,jfs35t,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/jfs35t/why_do_almost_all_drugs_give_me_panic_attacks/
208,"I'm not sure what happened that day, but I describe it as ""ego death without drugs"". I'm wondering if anyone has experienced something similar?","(Long read)

Well, it's not fully true. I started prozac a month ago, so I guess that would count as a ""drug"". It has exasberated my anxious symptoms and depression. I was already in a rut mentally, and I felt so much worse. Derealization, dissociation, anxiety, depression through the roof. At one point about a week ago, I had a mental ""breakdown"" where everything, all my darkest thoughts, my deepest self-hatred, my existential dread, my anxieties, my intrusive thoughts, it all came down on me at once. I was maybe hyperventilaing a bit, but aside from that, I was unmoving, eyes shot open, in fetal position in bed, held tightly by my boyfriend. I was in one of the worst states mentally in my life. I considered sending myself to the hospital because the intrusive thoughts were so loud and unending and uncalming.

So I sat there for what felt like forever, maybe 30 mins to 1h. I texted a collegue at work to ask to replace me last minute because I was gonna send myself to the hospital. He didn't respond.

So, even if it felt absolutely impossible, I got up, got dressed, and went to work. I had no choice in the matter. I already risked losing my job once, I wasn't gonna risk it again.

And in that time since, something in my brain clicked. Like a switch had been activated. It's like I went so deep in my mind, that my brain folded over itself. My view on things regarding my ego and myself has changed since that experience. I no longer ""hate"" myself. I have become less depressed. It happened quite fast. And that night and the day after, I felt so light and bright and happier. Like a weight was lifted off my shoulder.

I'm still living like this since. Even with anxiety and ocd, I find myself not questioning it too much, in fear that if I question it it will come back with a vengeance. I'm enjoying myself, this new and more loving of myself side of me. I am still very insecure and anxious about my person, I still fear I may come across narcisisstic at times or that I'm ""toxic"", but these thoughts no longer make me hate myself. I treat myself with more compassion and understading with everything I've gone through in my life. I still make efforts to go against the parts of me I don't like, and I let others know to tell me if I crossed lines, because for the first time in a long time, I'm letting myself just *be* myself. It feels good. It feels weird. And I don't know how to describe what happened to me other than the term ""ego death"" because these two words describe best what I went through thay day I feel.

I still have many other issues. This experience has not shifted my world view completely, I still have depression and anxiety, but I feel lighter about myself. Maybe it's the Prozac finally starting to work. I'm not sure. I'm writing in this subreddit hoping someone has some experience similar so I can put a word to it, maybe the term ""ego death"" is completely wrong, please let me know if so. I don't know anyone else who went through something like I did. I described what happened to me to my social worker and I basically left her spechless lol. I know I should be talking about these things to a psychologist/psychiatrist but my social worker is my only ressource for mental health at the moment so I tell her basically everything happening up there. Hoping she takes notes she can relay to a mental health ressource that can actually help me.

210,Has anyone had to give up Drugs or Alcohol due to declining Mental Health Reasons?,"I did... 

I'm 95 days Alcohol free (longest in life) and now 5 days for weed to combine for 100 days of Sobriety! 

I fully acknowledge and understand, most people won't develop serious problems like they do with harder stuff, such as cocaine, heroin or meth but when I, with an addictive personality, was drinking heavily (8-10 beers a night, every night) I'd woke up frequently to drunk texts involving death threats I wasn't even aware off! 

This is totally unacceptable, and inexcusable behaviour. 

When Ozzy's 73rd bday came (December 3, 2021) I said ""fuck it"" and haven't drink since nor plan to and proud I acknowledged this issue. 

Then March 4, 2022 at 08:10 (5 days now) I set a particular quit date and time I'm confident will work!

214,I keep hurting myself with drugs,"Hey Everyone I'm not ok, I'm so tired that I barely even feel sad or anything. I come from a fucked up house hold my mom and her boyfriends always drank and broke shit and yelled at each other keeping me up all night multiple times a week for my whole life it never stopped. My dad has been in jail for most of my life so I never had a father figure so I was just left with this toxic evil bitch to raise me. As I got older she started taking her anger out on me more and more as I became a man. When my grandmother died (probably form my mom getting her drunk while in critical condition the night before) she started keeping up all night with abuse for like 2 weeks strait and her and her boyfriend would gang up on me for not wanting to go to school in the morning. I end up getting drunk at a friend's house one day and when she came to get me she hit me. That just set me off from all the shit she put me through and I ended up destroying the house she was renting. So I moved back in with my dad but he had manipulative meth head girlfriend and I watched him slowly descend into delirium as the power and water got shut off and eventually he went back to jail and I ended up at my grandparents Wich is run by my junkie aunt. Some time when I was living with my dad I picked up a dxm habbit and I could get it for free so I was taking high doses every day. I didn't have a bed to sleep in I had to ask my grandfather for his car keys so I could sleep in there in the middle of winter and wake up freezing. Eventually I went crazy from brain damage of heavy dxm use I took over the dose that can kill you multiple times and was drinking it every day for like 3 months. I slowly came back and my mom eventually let me move back in but continued with the abuse while Making every one around her think I'm a minster. Shes been acting worse lately and the only person I can go to for help is my aunt who shoots up meth so I started using meth like every other day and I feel like that is bringing back the heart and brain damage from the dxm. I feel like shit haven't slept right in over a week. To top it off a girl has never even loved me or held my hand. My friend ended up talking me into getting an escort.

217,"a bit of what my last few weeks have been (TW// drugs, suicide attempt)","Three weeks ago I set a date to end my life. Waiting for that, I binged on weed and molly in an attempt to escape the pain while waiting for the day to arrive. I was waiting to be able to call my girlfriend one last time before ending my life. It was two days before that date that she broke up with me over text. I panicked, decided I didn’t want to wait and did it within 10 minutes. She could tell I was off and convinced to me to go to hospital. Before I was admitted to the psych ward I spent 4 hours on and off texting her as she got mad at me for attempting, saying how it hurt her, i was being manipulative, selfish, I took it too far, etc. That hurt. After that and being in the er for 8 hours I was admitted to a psych ward. I was there for two weeks. It consisted of hearing constant screaming and crying, guards staring at us, being locked in my room when upset, told I was being crazy, among other things. During the stay I assumed my now ex girlfriend was getting over me. Deciding she didn’t want me in her life anymore. While there I half accepted it because I didn’t know for sure, so I still had a small bit of hope. I got home today. She had texted me while I was gone saying she was abusing drugs and how she’s worried about me. The last few stating she didn’t want to talk to me anymore. At least for a few months. I had a feeling it would happen but seeing it and having it be a fact hurt more than I thought it would. I had a panic attack and cried a lot. It made getting home a whole lot worse.
