Considering only the effect of a substance on one’s body, psych meds surely aren’t neutral for your health, however they won’t cause serious problems if taken correctly under psychiatrist’s supervision.

I also double up with therapy - if you're all meds and no therapy, it can lead to dependence.

25,"I want to make a correction to what I’m seeing stated over and over and over again. 

No, all medications **do not** come with side effects.

All medications come with **the possibility of** side effects. 

If you have side effects, you will need to do a cost/benefit analysis. (Note that some side effects are desirable! One of my medications has a side effect of appetite suppression, which is great, as I’ve been overweight my entire life. Woot! – Interestingly, it also has a possible side effect of increased appetite, so I was lucky for my particular situation.) 

Another of my medications has a side effect of me not being able to drink carbonated beverages. I’m cool with it. Totally worth it to me. 

If the cost/benefit turns out poorly, you can explore alternate medications. I’ve done this for some medications I couldn’t stand the side effects of. For others, I started slow and at night and titrated upwards because it was worth it. 

If you do not have side effects, then all is good. Carry on with that medication. 

*But what if you have side effects and they are not discernible?* some may ask. That, my friends, is what I would call a problem for your medical team. Read on for more thoughts on this. 

For example, my GP (just before I started seeing a psych) learned that Straterra causes liver damage. I had been using Straterra to complement my Adderall. She ordered a test (which was prudent considering I am a heavy NSAID user due to chronic pain) and then upon seeing alarming results, ordered me to cease usage of Straterra. My next bloodwork showed that my liver is healthy and all is again well. 

I have a fantastic medical team. Anyone who doesn’t have the same needs to do everything they can to fix that first and foremost. That is something I lived without for far too long, so I know what a different it makes.",witeowl,184bes1
26,"Hi OP,

I work in a psych hospital, to answer your question yes long term use of psychiatric medication can be bad for the body, just like any medication
(but we are taking about decades of usage), 
but I would like to highlight that mental health is very important and it takes priority at times.

Generally psychiatric medication isn’t long term, but it’s important to take your medication as prescribed by your Doctor. ( I am speaking in terms of depression and heightened anxiety)

If diagnosed with psychosis or Bipolar affective disorder, treatment can be constant throughout your life, but to highlight again it would take many many years for it to have a negative impact but the impact is not significant compared to untreated mental health illness.

Now speaking in short term, if you experience side effects of medication, please report same to your Doctor.

Hope this helps.",PinkFluffyUnihorns,184bes1

40,"i’m on antidepressants and they kinda suck, but i’d rather be nauseous and alive than not nauseous and dead lmao. sleep meds are so tricky to work out, especially if you work, because tapering down impacts the rest of your day and it’s easier to just take meds than suffer the consequences of insomnia in my experience. 

there are more “natural” remedies, but they’re usually not as good and also have side effects- always speak to a doctor, obviously. i had a decent experience weaning off melatonin with valerian root extract. you can get them as regular pill supplements, but you can also have it in your tea. i also had a friend on similar meds and they got prescribed medical “grass” after moving to the states. they got off their sleep meds and it was apparently more effective (which does make sense i guess lol). you can also apparently buy melatonin gummies in shops over there too, which is crazy to me. 

i hope you find something that works better for you!! always talk to your doctor before tapering down, as that can come with its own batch of side effects and risks, and also tell them if you are switching to something herbal because interactions can occur.",sbagnall,184bes1

Sometimes it takes time to find the right medication and dosage to treat someone, but the most important part is that person has to want to get better by staying consistent with medication and informing their treatment team of how the meds are affecting them.

Outside of what you’ve already been doing to encourage him to seek treatment, you may want to consider setting healthy boundaries for the relationship.

Maybe instead of telling him to go to therapy, tell him how you feel and show him how much you care.

0,"Following this post because I’d like to know too. I have a lot of coping skills I use and I take magnesium, vitamin D and a B complex vitamin. I find the magnesium in particular helps anxiety/agoraphobia. 

Magnesium will make you need to poo as it stimulates the peristalsis of the intestines. 

Valerian root oil also works okay! It’s a bit potent smelling and some people hate the smell itself, but for me it’s just really strong. A couple sniffs and I’m a little more grounded. (: 

Mint can also be helpful. Either in an essential oil to sniff, or an aromatherapy soap/lotion, or even altoids. 

Eating in general turns on your parasympathetic nervous system, which is the part that turns “off” fight or flight. That said; if you’re feeling anxious, try eating some fruit, or some other healthy snack. 

(This “switch flick” is also part of why people binge eat…it’s physiologically comforting to us as humans. Evolutionarily…We didn’t stop and eat when we were in danger, only when we knew we were safe to focus on our food and not our surroundings. So you can “hack” the nervous system to relax by eating, the same way that eating relaxes the nervous system.) 

Drinking water can similarly signal to the nervous system to “chill out”, too. Cold water in particular. 

Cold/cool water showers or wiping your face and neck with a cold wet cloth can be so helpful. 

Ice cubes in your mouth or palm can help, too. 

I know those aren’t exactly straight up supplements. But they are kinda related? I hope that helps, OP. Best wishes!! I know this agoraphobia/panic disorder shit is NO JOKE.",No-Shelter-7753,18xf5qc

As for feeling something powerful? I wouldn't remember, I've been walking around at least sporadically since before I can remember. It's always been part of my life. If anything I should do it more.

Now, walking about with *earbuds* is newer because I used to be more afraid I'd get run over by cars, so do watch out for that; and for bad guys, since you won't hear them. But don't let that stop you from going out, you're in Ukraine not Saudi Arabia. There's nothing wrong or shameful about spending some time in nature with something soothing in your ears.

The only other things I can really think off the cuff is make sure you drink plenty of water, try to eat a little healthier if you're not (one step at a time and don't beat yourself up if you take a step back!) and take multivitamins you're not allergic to. Apparently they can literally improve your mood **if** you're chronically deficient - needless to say, if your diet is already mostly fresh veggies and whole grains with good variety, this isn't going to do much for you.

My own diet is very poor, for a European at least; but right now I'm working the first job I ever lasted more than a year in and it's definitely not because I got more mature - I didn't. I did start taking vitamins regularly some time before - just some cheap, no-name pills that dissolve in water, nothing special. This might not be a coincidence.

Edit: And don't allow anyone to shame you for doing perfectly normal, civilized human things! You're allowed to have fun and to be at ease, you don't have to stand at attention before the world's judging stare.

😳

Now, here's a bit of irony: I started working out not long after this talk. Nothing much, I just have two adjustable dumbbells at home. It's mostly an investment in my quality of life if I get to live long, for me.

My schedule is 4-5 times a week, only go twice a day if you're doing lighter stuff; if you lift enough to where you're looking at the possibility of growing stronger, don't overdo it, and look up advice from those in the know, on the Internet (tip: they tend to be right-wing weirdos, yes, even the nicer ones; but they know how to lift better than me, just focus on that).

I can say that if you start lifting weights, start small, figure out what you can do and how much incrementally, or you might injure yourself. And, if you try to start lifting *and* cardio, do the lifting *first.* Even with walks and work, if you don't lift first rest a few hours, even catch a nap if you can.

And keep in mind, this is maintenance. This is you doing things to make your life better - so the last thing you want to do is punish yourself by being anal about the schedule. For my part, I lift in the evening or early night (which isn't ideal but whatever, better than nothing), and I've had more than four hours between the earliest and latest starts.

Also, it's not going to magically make you feel better at once (except if you're lucky), and if you're like me, it never will. This is not your fault, it's not your failing, start then keep lifting and just enjoy your better-functioning body down the line.

Edit: Apparently the older we get, the more beneficial lifting is (if we don't get careless and injure ourselves)

Something like having and maintaining a nice life flow. Like making things easy.

So the environment should be prepared to handle things more easily.

&#x200B;

Recovering and maintaining solution paths with the ill person are very worthwhile.

But mind you it has to be right.

So next to therapy (sorting things out) , an ill person is often happier when the immediate environment is adjusted and helpful.

A key sign of ""delusional"" attack chains is increased or decreased ""risk"" taking.

Since it's a bit of an attack you and your mother should prepare for stressful situations and defusing.

I have this with my lupus meds. There's literally no reason for it, after all Im grateful for them and they keep me well. But I have times, like you, when I really, really struggle to take them. Never been able to work out why, as I say I'm grateful for them, but last time I went a month without taking them. It's really bloody hard.

I'm really strict with myself now. I set an alarm on my phone when I nees to take them, I already have them laid out, and I stop whatever I'm doing to take them. Strangely, I find it easier this way if I have to stop doing something because I have something to get back to rather than sitting there looking at them arguing with myself. 

When I went a month without, I paid for it, but still struggled.

There are experts, e.g. the National Council for Clinical Excellence (UK) who say medicine is not recommended for panic disorder or phobias.

I'm not assuming that these are you're only problems.  
  
Panic disorder often responds to self-help. In fact, Handbook of Self-Help Therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that of all the disorders, panic disorder is the one that’s most responsive to self-help.

Basically, therapy for phobias, explained in The Feeling Good Handbook by psychiatrist David Burns, is making a list of situations, ranking them according to how scary you find them, and using that ranked list as your objectives. Imagining a situation can be an objective. Start with something really, really easy.   
  
You can start with an objective as easy as standing in the doorway of the front door, then it could be walking to the mailbox.  
  
The thing to remember is never go from objective A to objective B until you feel completely confident with A. Things that give you confidence are experience and slow breathing. There's enormous laboratory and clinical evidence  that slow breathing is effective for calming people down quickly.

2) I cannot believe you are taking 2 different antidepressant medication and also an anti psychotic, I don't doubt for a second they wouldn't mix well. Highly likely giving you the symptoms you are describing.

1,"I'm convinced that, generally speaking, anxiety is easier to treat than depression. Calming down with a few minutes of slow breathing lets you think your way through a problem instead of worrying about it. With a little assistance, a child can do this.  
  
An advantage of this is that, as good stress management, it's good for preventing depression. The most common cause of depression is stress.  
  
If you're concerned about depression, click on my name and read. I have advice from experts.  
  
When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
   
   
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
   
   
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
   
   
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
   
   
When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.  
   
   
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
   
   
The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.   
  
  
Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.

2,"Not really true. Some doctors might not understand that weed benefits someone’s condition. It’s perfectly fine to safely experiment with it on your own to see if it works. And it’s not a gateway drug, you can very easily stick to just cannabis",aidenpaciorek,ugv0z1
3,"So this…used cannabis, and psychedilcs through my teens till about age 21. Some ocd/anxiety/depression issues(that id been taking meds/seeing a doctor for since 14yo) apparently had matured and all I would get were bad trips and paranoia from cannabis.  Fast forward 15 years of different doctors, meds, therapy etc to no avail. Toss in an addiction or two along the way. I decided big pharma wasn’t helping and drastic measures needed to be taken. So I gathered all the psychedelics that gave me bad trips and headed to the desert to face my demons.  It was ok. It wasn’t necessarily fun but therapeutic(I continue to pursue this “exposure therapy” but that’s a different thread)  A year later I decided to try cannabis again.  And it’s definitely helped. Instead of getting frustrated and acting out over some stupid thing I would laugh at it. And one time I even came up with a creative solution to that annoyance.  It’s been about a month that I’ve been doing the old hippie hay again but so far so good.  Like really a pleasant and noticeable difference. Which after 15 years of not being able to tell whether my psych meds had any effect or not.

This shits scary man, sorry i dont have any answers other than my own frustrations, Hope it helps to know you arent alone in this.",Any_Oven_817,vtxxrz
2,"Broadly my advice would be that it's been at least 6 weeks and you are functioning better. Does depend on the medication. For example, most SSRIs they will recommend at least 6 weeks of use provided there are no side effects and then assess. If you feel like you are functioning better than before you had them, they might be working.

So for antidepressants and depression, it might mean that you have better motivation to get out of bed in the morning, shower etc.

For anxiety it might mean that your sleep has improved.

It is a very personal question because obviously I don't know how you struggled pre the meds and after.

Medical professionals will advocate a lot for medication, it definitely has its purposes and can be life changing-provided it is the correct medication. If it has been a decent amount of time since you started, then stand your ground with doctors. Sometimes it just needs an increase, sometimes the medication needs to be changed.

A lot of people are reluctant to start medication, and a lot of people the doctors might see are difficult. Reluctant to seek help. I think because of this, when you are genuine and are trying to tell a doctor the medication isn't working, then they immediately presume the aforementioned.

If it has been a decent amount of time and you've seen little to no improvement, keep advocating. I've been there. Eventually a doctor listened to me and offered a different medication which worked. Similarly my first psychiatrist wouldn't answer my questions either, in the end I went to my family doctor who I'd a good relationship with and he answered my questions instead. Sometimes doctors can be difficult unfortunately.

Another good way to tell if the medication is working is ask someone close to you. Typically even if you're struggling to note differences pre and post meds, they can tell. Again, an example might be that they notice you get less upset at small things. That you are practicing better hygiene. Again, very dependent on the medication and illness in question too.",Savings-District-158,vtxxrz
3,">  If you feel like you are functioning better than before you had them, they might be working.

I guess my problem is that my swings mean I might be feeling better week 6... but then worse week 8... then better week 12... and worst of all week 16...

How do I differentiate between feeling better because of the meds and feeling better just because? I've got no grounds to predict how I'd be feeling without them to compare to.",sennbat,vtxxrz
4,"I think try to look at it as a whole, if weeks 6-16 were broadly better than before, that's a good sign.

Differentiating between feeling better because of meds or just in general is more difficult. A lot of the time people don't know the answer to that until they are off medication. A lot of the time people don't realise the positive effects fully until they think they're okay and start coming off. I have very much also had the experience of not noticing any change and arguing to come off, and yeah.. They really weren't doing anything. My partner has had the opposite experience. A long time on them, doing great, didn't think they were necessary anymore and then could only manage a few months off before going back on them. It is a hard one to manage. 

Regardless, at times when you feel better, start noting what helps. So if week 7 was a good week and that week was... A vacation let's say, well then that's probably the root of feeling better. If week 9, you were socialising a lot and that helped, then note that. Antidepressants should help you function, and sometimes we don't notice that they are helping us use positive coping mechanisms. They shouldn't magically make you feel better, you'll still have lows. In fact, I'd be kinda scared if you were 100% okay with them. They're only meant to get you back to normal, still normal ups and downs and should facilitate you being able to cope with those ups and downs better. Hope this helps.",Savings-District-158,vtxxrz

1,"Going to a psychiatrist is a very eye-opening experience if you don't understand why exactly you feel the way you do. You know you're depressed, but coming out of a psychiatrist office knowing what your depression does to you as well as having a treatment that could help in making you feel better is one of the most reassuring moments I've ever had. To know that what you feel is real, and that you have the power to change how you feel. That's just me at least, I know some people see it differently.

In terms of medicine, it really depends. I currently take Vyvanse for ADHD as well as depression fueled by ADHD symptoms, and it helps tremendously. There might be a trial and error process to find medication that works best (I think I went through 4 or 5 different ADHD and depression medications), but when it works, it works like a charm. 

Don't worry about treatment not working or being misdiagnosed. If you give your psychiatrist all the information you can, they will be able to give you a proper diagnosis  and proper treatment plan. It just takes some time. Also if someone gives you shit for taking medicine just leave them, its not worth your time arguing with someone stupid enough to shit on mental health treatment.",Sweet_Ad7758,osx1w1

People wear glasses to correct their eyesight and people with diabetes take insulin every day to control their blood sugar level. Antidepressants are no different: they help your brain to function at its best when it needs a little help :)

Please be aware that your symptoms could get worse at the beginning, though, before getting better. I would suggest you ask someone you trust to keep an eye on you, just in case. You might also want to quit your medication too soon because you think it doesn't work. Give it some time before making this decision and don't be afraid to talk to your psychiatrist or pharmacist if you have any concerns.

8,"The diversity of comments you are getting reflects a diversity of experiences.  Some folks have a good experience with anti-depressants and other psychiatric meds.  For some folks, the meds come with heavy side-effects and/or difficult withdrawal.  Your psychiatrist may or may not warn you of all of the risks that come with medication when prescribing; but the typical psychiatrist is honest insofar as explaining that meds work differently on different people, and there is usually some trial and error in getting the best anti-depressant prescription.  What many psychiatrists won't tell you, however, is that for some people the best prescription isn't that good.",johnbanes330,osx1w1

I don’t take them because they’re highly addictive and Advil works just fine while I’m home and resting, it’s still not enough for while I’m at work, but I don’t want to be on heavy pain meds at work anyway! it’s just frustrating to not be taken seriously. One doctor even told ME my pain isn’t that bad, while I’m undiagnosed!!!

I will definitely look into reading that book!",bms246,osx1w1

Not even subtly.  Directly!  Also, the nicknames they come up for us!!  :/

Thank you, I hope you get treatments that work for you.

Unfortunately, my repeated(even recently)traumas have locked me into a catch-22 where it may be impossible to get *any* treatment at all and as of this moment I am refusing all anti-psych drugs for any use(I have actual video of psych and other specialty doctor encouraging easy ways to lie to patients who are not psychotic to get them to take anti-psychotics and have papers of others on techniques of lying through misdirection with ""difficult patients""  such as those in deep fear due to being medically traumatized.  See?  Catch-22.  

I am struggling to see a doctor(first in 4 months out of my trauma and fear, not insurance)  I don't even have a doctor right now.

Sorry, too much ""memememe"". 

Thanks.  I hope better for you in the future",AliceQuixoteDent,osx1w1
19,"the note about refusing psych drugs is due to the fact that the only treatments ppl offer for fibromyalgia pain are anti-psychotics and the like.  Which damage the brain permanently.  So, by refusing them for my safety, and my knowledge that doctors often do not believe finro is real, leaves me with no treatment options.  I absolutely refuse opiates, and that was before I learned that opiates can make some fibro issues much worse, and, for fibro, don't work at all.  no one knows why.",AliceQuixoteDent,osx1w1
20,"Wow that sounds so incredibly frustrating. Just know that there are good doctors out there. With COVID, the option for telehealth has made commuting to further practices not an issue anymore. Also, I have had way better experiences with female nurse practitioners. Just an opinion, but I find them to be way less egotistical and a lot more grounded and helpful. Obviously a really broad blanket statement, but even my mother in the medical field agrees with me, on a work relationship level. I hope you find answers! Maybe avoid looking at those groups to not allow yourself to psych yourself out. I took an ethics in the medical field class last semester, and doctors have an oath to maintain over exerting any means to diagnose and treat and listen to patients. It’s shameful to those doctors who joke, and completely against everything they’re sworn to, which is the most embarrassing thing here. You deserve and absolutely have the right to answers and treatment, and that’s the truth. Don’t let those rotten apples discourage you",bms246,osx1w1

1,"You already rely on chemicals  to function. Chemicals, nutrients, hormones, neurotransmitters. 

Take psychiatric medicine or stimulants such as Adderall* isnt the same as having an addiction or a dependency. 

Your body isnt doing what it is supposed to be doing on it's own, for whatever reason. People often experience countless hardships, mental instability, physical illness as a result of mental health taking a toll on major organ systems...all kinds of stuff. The point is, not treating a medical or psychiatric condition is basically a guarantee that you will continue to suffer and fail to thrive.

These medications are meant to help your body regulate itself the way it supposed to. You would be dependent either way - either you're dependent but your brain doesnt have a chemical imbalance and works as it should, regulating various functions, producing hormones (which also regulate stuff!), and all the neurotransmitters are going where they need to go. Your health and mi mnd are dependent on these things to happen in a certain way, at certain times. Period. 

If your brain has a chemical imbalance and you have been diagnosed with something... you should certainly treat and manage that condition. Choosing not to is effectively deciding to make things more difficult on purpose. 

Take ADHD - we know that brains who suffer from it have a dopamine deficiency, resulting from the an abundance of dopamine receptors that, without meds, do not re-uptake enough dopamine...
Which causes people with ADHD to engage in behaviors that they find enjoyable so that their brain will get the dopamine hit it needs to function.

People with ADHD (unmedicated) are known to engage in  pleasure-seeking activities (sometimes very dangerous ones. They are impulsive, they struggle with self-regulation and usually lack the ability to switch from one activity to the next, especially if they were having fun but now they have to work...we procrastinate, we have no concept of time, we daydream when we are bored because we would rather imagine our own fun than sit through something we dont get any joy from (especially little kids), we struggle to regulate our emotions, we are easily distracted and often times we get depressed because we are so fruatrated that we are unable to just do what needs to be done in a timely manner but everyone else can. Lots of shame, self loathing, self destruction, substance abuse, etc etc

Allllllll of that is cause by your brain being dependent on dopamine.....but because it is unable to produce enough, it has to compensate by engaging in activities like i described above. ADHD folks struggle to keep jobs and to perform as well in school, they're more likely develop an addiction if they start to use drugs and begin to self-medicate. We are also very like to become depressed from an the failed projects and impulsive  shit we get ourselves into. 

There is even research that says if you DONT treat your adhd early in life, you are significantly more likely to develop irreverable memory problems later in life.


So yeah  youre already dependent. 

If you are one of those ""but it isnt natural"" people...neither are any of the additives in your food, or your vape. Neither is corn  actually. We genetically engineered that shit. Your beauty products and shampoos have all sorts of crazy chemicals in them are arent regulated nearly as well as your adderall prescription. 

Also, the most deadly things on eat...are naturally occurring. There's this teeny tiny fish in the ocean that instantly kills anything that brushes up against it. All natural, 100% deadly lol

If you take your adderall as prescribed...no more tha  the recommended dose...you should be fine

So far as your birth control goes - if you forget to take a pill every day....i highly recommend the neuvaring. It's just a bendy plastic ring that you pinch together and push up where it needs to go... then you just forget about it for a month and swap it for a new one. It's dope. You dont feel it at all.

2,"Oh my gosh thank you so much for this amazing response!! I like your matter of fact way of speaking. It's true what you say, that I'm already dependent on dopamine to function, but I've been running on a deficit this whole time. Taking medication solves that problem. Thanks to you I have a much better understanding of my issue.

As for BC, it was 10 years ago I was on the pill. This past year I went with Mirena IUD. I've had it for about 4 months. Last year my periods decided to become a lot more painful for a lot longer. In the past it's been 1 day of cramps that were bearable with ibuprofen, and the month before I got the IUD it was 4 solid days of flesh ripping medicine resistant cramps. 

Last month I had no cramps at all. 😎",aml686,ryizve

 I've been diagnosed with BPD for 6 years. He asked me why I'm diagnosed, I said I don't know and I tried to elaborate, but he cut me off. He asked me if I act out sexually or spend recklessly. I said no to both and tried to explain again, but he cut me off and that was my time to leave. 

After a week and a half stay I saw my paper work for the first time. He took away the diagnosis of BPD; kept the diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder and PTSD and added major depressive disorder.

2,"I can relate to that disconnected, demotivated feeling and the nightmares. I had the same feeling when I began with my medication but I can't emphasize this enough: Do Not Stop Taking Your Meds Just Yet. 

Hopefully, you are receiving regular therapy. Therapy should not just be about talking about your problems. There comes a time when your therapist will sit you down and talk to you about healthy coping mechanisms and other techniques that help you deal with your mental illness. This works best when in conjunction with medication. 7 out of 10 pasients give up on medication and therapy before this point and end up relapsing or worse. 

If you stick with it, your therapist will eventually slowly wean you off the mind numbing meds to something that just takes the edge off. 

The whole process took 5 years for me and I have been 4 years unmedicated. It doesn't mean I am healed, I still get episodes but I am better equipped to handle them than I was 10 years ago.

0,"Benzodiazapines such as diazepam are indeed very effective against anxiety as they calm the nervous system (why they are given for seizures). However, your GP is right to avoid prescribing you benzodiazapines. 

I am a psychiatric nurse and have worked in a detox ward where there are increasingly more people coming in for benzo addiction and they often started with a prescription for anxiety. The withdrawal from benzos is brutal. The more you use them, the less effective they become and they are highly addictive. What's more is, as the body 'gets used to' the nervous system being suppressed, it compensates more for it and if you don't get the medication when your body is expecting it, your nervous system gets excited and you can have seizures (or even just pretty bad anxiety). I am not saying that everyone prescribed regular benzos will become addicted, it is just very easy to do so. 

If you are concerned about the amount of medication you take regularly for your anxiety, I would listen to your psychologist and ask for some practical advice on dealing with anxiety as it occurs. I know things like mindfulness will not feel as effective as diazepam, but will be far more beneficial to you in the long term. If you start taking medication intended for short term use for a long term problem, it's not going to fix anything in the long term and may actually make things worse.

However, if you still feel that benzos are the most suitable way forward for you, tell your doctor that and listen to what they have to say. If you still disagree, get a second opinion from another GP. I'm presuming you are UK based and I don't think you'd have much luck going directly to a psychiatrist through the NHS.

I hope you find something that helps you and I wish you well in your recovery.",amymeaniemineymo,a1s25v
1,"I currently am having a hard time getting my medication. For a year doctors tried everything for my panic attacks. One day in the doctors office I was getting my blood drawn and I went limp and tunnel vision. They gave me a small dose of Ativan. It changed my life. Guess what? They don't want to give it to me anymore. Now I am hanging by a thread and having panic attacks about having a panic attack without my medication that works. 

People apparently say CBD helps, I can't afford something that is $70. My Ativan is $5. Also my dose is the smallest. ",ChefxK3nna,a1s25v
2,"I used to be on benzodiazapines for years, and while the high dose was really helpful, and the main reason of how I managed to finish my education, there's a good reason why no one in this day and age in my country would be willing to prescribe me the regular dose I used to be on. While I didn't struggle to get off benzos, a lot of people find it incredibly hard!  In these days in the UK, I might occasionally be given a few days' worth on a low dose, but I've found that to have zero effect.

I have tried CBD, too, but have also found that have absolutely no effect on my any of my symptoms. 

I now have a prescription for Promazine Hydrochloride to take as and when I need. Major caveat - I don't think this is prescribed in the USA anymore at all (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong!), and even here in the UK, a lot of doctors I've come across have raised some eye brows about this. It's a first gen anti-psychotic, but for me personally, it's great. It gives a bit of an anti-high really, so while it's effective in a crisis or in a bad situation, I'm definitely not likely to ever take it unless I really need it. I won't consent to second gen anti-psychotics for anxiety again, as long as I have capacity (which I'm unlikely to lose), so I'm glad to have this option.

This is probably not very helpful - just sharing my experience...",Jimenyboo,a1s25v

4,"I am feeling for you love. Are you in the US? 

I want to try cbd as well, once I’m off all the other stuff. 

I think everyone with anxiety disorders should be given a chance with “as needed” like Ativan and once the patient starts calling in for early refills, then they know to stop the benzos script, Ya know what I mean? Cause my mom has a bottle of xanax she barely touches and has needed a refill since last year lol and I’m lucky enough that she’ll let me have one if I’m in a shakey attack state but I shouldn’t have to borrow from mom to achieve relief. I probably sound so misinformed and naive lol but I feel whole heartedly that benzos alone and as needed could really really help me get natural again! That also sounds like an oxymoron but you understand surely and I hope you can find relief soon as well. ",kishfish,a1s25v

1,"The beauty of self-help is that you have a variety of low cost, low risk things that can be combined with each other, and with standard treatments with office visits. While it's not clear at this time that any one of these things is as effective as an antidepressant, it's common sense that if a variety of reasonably good things are combined with each other, they will have considerable effect.  
  
The best thing for you might be a combination of things, and it's easy to combine self-help methods.  
  
I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits. You're welcome to click on my name and read. Video, below - details about self-help based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression - nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise, and social support, also traditional Asian methods.

Used to be my work that kept me sane until the work dried up. I've tried all kinds of things. Mostly playing on my PC, taking classes online, and chatting with a few friends. Having a cat helps too. When I was single I'd get around a bit and would chat with a lot of people I'd meet online. That was always fun having so many stories to hear about.

But for everyone proper diet is big, good sleep hygiene, exercise, mindfulness exercises, meditation, cold plunges, or even things like breathing techniques. A couple podcasts have made a big difference for me as well [Huberman Labs](https://open.spotify.com/show/79CkJF3UJTHFV8Dse3Oy0P?si=mHunTnvkSUmSxxAxjWNDQg&utm_source=copy-link&dl_branch=1) and [Jason Ellis Show](https://open.spotify.com/show/1GRwIeEnWJuoZIMq6HdGMB?si=IZ2TPeaWQ5CoQBgzMLBBqQ&utm_source=copy-link&dl_branch=1).

0,"I don’t know if you feel comfortable sharing which medicines you are using—an SSRI or a benzodiazepine? I ask because some SSRIs have anti-anxiety effects, and SSRIs have the potential for other side effects, including flatness, etc. If so, usually the side effects can still be much better than being very ill.

A benzodiazepine—taking it as prescribed and as recommended by your provider will not change your personality or make you “less you”. Instead, it likely will make you feel more like yourself. Anxiety has a way of pulling you away from the present, and taming that will give you practice living in the present. Once you adapt to being in the present, you might notice that you find a part of yourself that was hidden. 

I will add though that if you feel like you’re taking benzos too often, talk with your doctor about concerns. There are different kinds of benzos that have different effects, and if one doesn’t work, another might.",holly1231,f8yjce
1,"Yes..

Personally I had a bad experience with drugs before, nothing but side effects, but now I understand those drugs weren't the ones I needed..

For a long while I tried to heal myself holistically ( ie no drugs only talk therapy and daily rituals for wellness) and it worked for a while..I was getting better.

Now however I'm facing difficult times and reconsidering the no drugs thing..Some people I know swear by them, and they help them have normal lives.

It's hard to tell how the drug will affect you as they tend to affect people differently..There is a chance that you'll need to switch drugs until you find something that works for you.

Either way drugs don't change who you are as a person. You might still be more anxious than the next person, but not to the extent that you'll worry too often or even have attacks.

This might clear some head space for other things ..For life itself even..

That said however, I do not advocate for their use for self betterment as a life long solution.

The best way, in my opinion, is to use them while going to therapy weekly if you can, so with time you'd learn how to live without them and still not be plagued by anxiety.

Hope you'll find your way to healing soon :)",AndruilOfTheAbyss,f8yjce
2,"Depends on how strong the meds are. Unless you have very severe anxiety meds that are usually prescribed don't affect your personality. Your anxiety is there to make you suffer, not to make you quirky or interesting. So don't worry. The only changes I noticed when I started my meds were positive. They helped me open up.",AraneaNox,f8yjce

0,"Magnesium helped me get back to my baseline anxiety after side effects from escitalopram, apparently it's a muscle relaxer and people with anxiety carry a lot of muscle tension which in turn convinces us we are anxious, get rid of the tension and you feel less anxious.

St. John's Wort has a lot of promising research behind it (apparently it is just as effective as prescription antidepressants). I tried it myself and it didn't work for me but then again none of the prescription meds I have tried have worked either.

 Just be aware that vitamins, minerals, and supplements are largely unregulated so you can't be sure how much of the active ingredient you are getting or what else they are throwing into the tablets/capsules. 

These are the two I am most familiar with, there are others that I know of that have some effectiveness (salmon oil, evening primrose, and vitamin D are others that have been recommended to me) but I haven't researched those as extensively. ",Merlocked,ayltoi

0,"Yes, and no - which is my very roundabout way of saying that it depends. 

In my experience, sometimes talking things out is what I need to accept a situation or thought pattern. Specifically, talking about embarrassing irrational fears and things of that nature. Sometimes speaking to a therapist about these things is enough to get my brain to accept them somewhat. 

In a lot of ways therapy, for me specifically, has been the best medicine. But not necessarily just the talking. I see therapy as getting an education, learning about myself and my mind and my mental health. I learn valuable skills and coping strategies. Sure, talking is a part of it - but it is what I take away from therapy - the skills, lessons, and insights - that have been the most healing for me. 

That being said, sometimes you are at a place where you cannot even begin to talk things out or to receive therapy. Here, the best medicine is, well, medicine. Sometimes medication is absolutely crucial and life saving. A lot of physical symptoms must first be addressed with proper medication. If ones mental health symptoms are unbearable, the first goal is to decrease these symptoms, bring them to a somewhat manageable level, and only then can therapy take place - when one is ready. Personally, I think everyone and anyone should go to therapy at least once in their lives - mental health concerns or not. It has helped me gain insight that I don’t imagine I could get otherwise. It’s not easy - in fact it’s a lot of work, and at times it makes you feel worse for a period of time before things finally get better. But in my opinion, it is so worth it.",peachypinch,bqfjhk

0,"It really depends. Are you seeing someone about this stuff? Therapy is usually the best first step, because medication alone isn't going to fix things.

1,"My anxiety was so bad that I could not operate without medicine. Panic attacks were a very regular thing and having your body go through stress that frequently isn’t fun. 

The side effects of depression like being unable to eat or sleep also means you are running on fumes a lot of the time, and when combined with anxiety, is perfect for a disaster. 

Psychiatric medicine is a funny thing. If two people took the exact same doses of the exact same medicine, they might turn out to have different effects. We don’t know why. We don’t understand the brain enough to know why. 

As for your concerns, psychiatric medicine may have side effects for the first few weeks. It takes anywhere between 4-8 weeks to take effect so if this is your first time taking them, you might feel *some* side effects. Could be a little intrusive, but once you get over the hump, you’ll feel better. 

You’re also going to be told to look out for allergies and stop taking it if you suspect an allergy. If you haven’t been taking them for a long period of time (like I have been taking them for years continuously), a withdrawal is very unlikely if you stop cold turkey. 

Common anti-depressants are perhaps the worst medicine for abuse. They make it so it’s incredibly hard to abuse common anti-depressants. Stay away from things like benzos and you should be fine (coming from someone who got hooked on Xanax). The side effects you get initially might cause you to have suicidal thoughts, for example, but it’s something you will be told to look out for.",,ozv04y
2,"Thanks for this, very comprehensive, really appreciate it",aod20,ozv04y
0,"Just some quick, unorganized thoughts. I'm not a doctor so don't take my word as gospel. 

Quetiapine and divalproex is mood stabilizers and duloxetine is an SNRI (anti depressant). Divalproex seems to mostly be for schizophrenia and manic episodes as a result from bipolar disorder, so if you don't have troubles with that it might not do much for you and it seems to have quite a few possible side effects. I know quetiapine is sometimes used both for treating depression/anxiety and to help with sleep, but it's most likely quetiapine that's making you so tired, which you mentioned. If you started them all at once, which other meds you've tried and what diagnoses you have/suspect would effect what meds are worth trying and really only a psychiatrist has the possibility to make an educated guess. 

When you mention that you don't get addictive meds and want quick relief from anxiety I'm guessing you've tried to get xanax, is that correct? If so, it's not a long term solution, especially if you need it more than a few times a week. It also only lasts around 2-3 hours so is mostly helpful for panic attacks, while diazepam is better for more long lasting anxiety but it's also still addictive and shouldn't be used too often. In whole it is better to find a medication/combination of medications that makes it so that you don't need benzos instead of using them several times a week, but it can take longer to find the right one/s. Benzos can however be valueble when you change your doses and/or medications, maybe ask for it as a temporary help while changing your meds. Also, adderall can cause more anxiety and is generally not prescribed for tiredness.

You really should go see a psychiatrist and ask to get help to evaluate if any of your meds help or can be removed. Since you already are suicidal you really, really shouldn't mess with your meds at all without contact with at least a general practition doctor. You will need to see a doctor to get new meds so you might as well visit one and get both a new medication and a schedule to taper down at least one of the old ones and taper up the new one. You don't want to just add a new medication without removing the ones that don't help you. 

As for specific medications, without kniwing what you've already tried, a somewhat less popular but in my experience good medication is wellbutrin (NDRI anti depressant), also lamictal might be a good substitute for quetiapine, it's a mood stabilizer that cuts the lows more than the ups. Wellbutrin shouldn't make you more tired, more likely the opposite, and lamictal would probably not make you as tired as quetiapine does at least. I also wonder (after just a quick google search) if divalproex is all wrong for you, the only indications I find is for seizures, bipolar during manic episodes, schizophrenia and migrane. 

For some it takes time to find the right medication and for severe depression and anxiety a combination of meds and therapy gives the best effect, but it doesn't sound like that's possible for you. I've tried 3 SSRI, 2 SNRI, 1 NRI, 1 NDRI and 2 mood stabilizers, including the ones I'm on now. Also DBT, CBT (both in group and individual), and a few sessions more general psychotherapy but it wasn't for me. Now I'm on wellbutrin and quetiapine but in the process of switching to lamictal, and are waiting for a psychologist specializing in autism (which I just got diagnosed with about 3 years ago, so all prior treatment have been focusing on the wrong things). I've had 2 wrong diagnoses which I've been treated for without success, social phobia and borderline pd. Other than autism I also have recurring depression and generalized anxiety.

It is worth fighting to get better, I've been suicidal since around 15 years old, I'm 29 now and was at my lowest maybe 3-4 years ago. I've actively been in contact with psychiatrists the last 6 years and it was first 2-3 years ago I started to find the right meds and my suicidal thoughts subsided to a point where I can handle it. 

I understand that it is harder for you since you don't have access to free health care and can't get paid long term leave from work, but it's better to go into debt than to be dead. When you're in contact with doctors etc don't undersell your problems, be precise and if anything exaggerate a little, at least where I live people tend to think it's bot as bad as you say it is. Use people around you, ask everyone, even if you think they won't care and don't take it personal if they can't help, most people don't know how, are afraid or don't have the energy, it doesn't mean you don't matter. Look into self help, CBT and DBT is possible to do on your own and could be a good complement to new medication. Try everything you can think of, there's nothing that's not worth doing to survive. Kill yourself today and you can't make it undone, you can never get it back, live today and you can always die tomorrow. And don't set your goal too far away, focus on a day at a time, or an hour if that is all you can muster up the strength for. No matter what, every minute you live is an accomplishment when you carry all the weight that you do, every minute you're alive you're doing good, commend yourself for it.

This is maybe not so much an answer to your question in the title, but there's more you can do to get better than to get a specific medication, and no one can tell you exactly which medication will help you, only time will answer that so focus on just buying you some time, and be as kind to yourself as you can, you deserve it.",ms_vritra,czidpz
1,"I appreciate it! It’s a lot of useful information!! Thank you


With adderal it’s more that I want it to actually be able to do stuff, and I feel that even when I wasn’t on medication I couldn’t sit and do one thing and I just wanted to lay in bed so i felt like it did help. I did try to get xanex or something like that because I sometimes will get those panic/anxiety attacks where I breakdown and even start to hurt myself(hitting, scratching, and cutting) so I really really felt like I needed something to take, generally I can manage my anxiety more than my depression, more recent visits with psychiatrist seem to lean toward maybe also being bipolar so that’s how I’ve accepted taking my quetapine.


The meds I’ve been on I can remember are Prozac, Ventlafaxine, propranolol, amitryptalin, gabapentin. The quetapine, ventlafaxine, and gabapentin were the most recent ones before of what I’m on now. I also struggle with sleep but I much prefer smoking weed to go to sleep than anything since I wake up like a normal person the next day. 


It’s very difficult to even gather strength even for a minute because I feel like I already gave up, in the past year I attempted twice once landing me in the hospital and the other having someone give me narcan to reverse all the pills I took. I was very upset I survived both times, and now I just aimlessly see if I can get better to stay alive for my family. What you said about always being able to kill myself tomorrow helps, I’ll just wait until I can’t anymore and by then hopefully I have something that helps me. This past year has been extremely rough, I’ve failed myself in almost every way possible so my lows and my default are way worse and it doesn’t improve. I used to have hope last time I got out of inpatient but then I went downhill again. It’s frustrating and I don’t have any tools that actually help, right now my meds are a hindrance because I dislike them a lot... sometimes I don’t even take them if it’s too late because I work so early and I hate having to be awake and on the quetapine. 


I feel like I know myself pretty well and wish I could tell my psychiatrist straight up if we can try something but since I’m 20 they probably are just seeing a child that wants to resell the xanex or is just gonna party with it and adderal.",Seobooty,czidpz
2,"I don't know what it's like where you live but where I live aderrall is only prescribed for ADHD and in very rare cases to help with executive functions if you're diagnosed with autism. Wellbutrin has a chance to give you more go. Otherwise they might be less restrictive with modafinil. It seems you've tried 1 SSRI, might be worth to try another one, maybe one of the newer ones. Venlafaxine is a SNRI just like Cymbalta and I don't believe there's any more like them, either way I would most likely not be worth trying. I know very little about tricyclic antidepressants so can't say anything about amitriptyline. It sounds like propranolol mostly effects the physical symtoms of anxiety so probably not super weird that it didn't help. There's an NRI called reboxetine, it's effect has been questioned but it at least work different from all the others (same with wellbutrin). It was the first medication to actually help me, unfortunatly it took away most of my feelings, even the good ones, but it was very effective so I still have it to switch to if my life is at stake. 

If you have a history of ODing that's probably a major factor in you not getting benzos. Since you got narcan I'm guessing at least one of the times was with opiates? If so that's even more of a hindrance. Have you tried alimemazine, hydroxyzine or promethazine? They're usually less effective than benzos, and you often get tired from them, but they are non addicting and could be a solution if you don't get any benzos.

It might be most effective to go to a psychiatrist and list the meds you've tried and just ask to try something else, and to get something to help temporarily when it's really bad. If you don't ask for anything specific it raises less flags, but really try anything they give you in that case. Trying many medications with the same doctor usually works best since you build trust. I have both diazepam and xanax only because I've shown I can handle it for over 5 years. I've never tried to OD, never taken them often enough to get addicted and they always last longer than they have to, so my doctor trusts me. 

Also, you haven't failed, yourself or anyone else it's just too much pain and it's not your fault. Suffering alot is not weakness or anything like that, living through suffering, no matter how, is strength. You do as good as you can given your circumstances, I can't even work, or cook food, ai barely clean the apartment, clothes or dishes, but that's okay too, we all do the best we can.",ms_vritra,czidpz

0,"If you have a primary care doctor who you see regularly, they can oftentimes prescribe medications such as anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications. So in the way you could be killing two birds with one stone. You should check and make sure though, there are some PCPs who won't prescribe. ",j_bee_hoo,49luzi
1,"You absolutely have to see someone in person, online psychiatry does not exist, which is a good thing. A number of medications used to treat mental illnesses can be abused, which is why it's so important for a trained professional to prescribe them, and to meet with you regularly in person to monitor your progress. Some medications can't even be filled over the phone by your psychiatrist, you're required to turn in a new physical prescription slip each time (if you're in the U.S., these rules sometimes vary by state). All in all, it's very good that online psychiatry doesn't exist, because medication is something that should be handled in person by a professional so as to be safe rather than sorry.

Also, therapists are different from psychiatrists, just in case you didn't realize that. A therapist will have a degree in psychology, a non-medical field, whereas a psychiatrist will have a degree in psychiatry, which is a medical field. A therapist/psychologist cannot prescribe you medication, whereas a psychiatrist can, and though a psychiatrist will spend some time talking with you about how you're feeling and such, their primary role is prescribing and monitoring medication.

You're going to have to MAKE room in your schedule. As hard as it might be, you may need to drop a commitment in order to make time. It will be worth it. So you can conceptualize: a typical therapy session takes 50-60 mins, while a typical psychiatrist session is often shorter (I've had ones that were 30 mins and ones that were 45). Therapy sessions can be as often as you like, but at least once weekly is recommended. Psychiatrist sessions don't need to be as frequent -- typically a psychiatrist will want to check up with you once a month, until you find something that you both are absolutely certain is working, at which point your psych may decide that you two can meet less often.",dronethis,49luzi

4,"Perhaps I don't understand the potency of typical psychological drugs, but I don't really see why an online psychiatrist wouldn't exist. My thinking is doctors in general typically rely on you to tell them how you're doing, and how they drugs they prescribed are affecting you. So, unless blood work, or something like that, needs to be done in person, why not an online psychiatrist?

Because if it isn't, and you're commenting just to put someone down, or make them feel like an idiot which is what you did in my case, then I hope you will not take the time to hit the submit button and instead read back what you wrote and really think about how you would feel if you were the receiver of your own comment.

It sounds like they take the reins wholeheartedly when it comes to diagnosing and coming up with a solution/medication plan, which honestly doesn't sound like something I want. 

I am functioning well with the issues I struggle with. I still get up every day, go to all of my classes, turn in all of my work, work 20 hours a week, etc. However, I lack a lot of energy. I feel lethargic throughout the day, every day, and I'm not happy or excited about pretty much anything anymore. I feel so unhappy it physically hurts. It is mostly the physical perspective I wanted to resolve. I think once I start feeling better I will be better. This is why I felt an online psychiatrists or doctor would be a better fit for me.

6,"I'm on other meds but these are the mental health meds I'm on:

\*Lexapro (Escitalopram)

\*Wellbutrin (Bupropion)

\*Tofranil (Imipramine)

\*Seroquel (Quetiapine)

The Lexapro was the one that shut me down.

&nbsp;

I really wish they could do something about these side effects, because my anti-depressants shut off my sex drive completely. I had to try 12 different anti-depressants before I found one that worked, so I won't consider giving it up over sex. I was on the edge of suicide before I got on meds so it is worth it, but it is really hard to have 0 sex drive.

&nbsp;

Like /u/AintGotNoMilk , I hate that my husband feels like this is his fault. It has nothing to do with him, but it's hard to make him understand that when he doesn't feel the way I do. It's a no win situation. I can keep the pills and 0 sex drive or drop the pills and become an emotional disaster/suicidal mess.

&nbsp;

On the pharma side, they see the sex drive side effect as a bonus and not a problem. Boosted sex drive means they can resell it as boner pill. Lack of sex drive means a desperate person is going to buy Viagra or something similar to increase their libido. Others may do therapy or try new meds. All of which big pharma makes money on. There is really no incentive for them to create a better drug. I mean look at cancer treatment - chemo is barbaric. They created the first formula in 1916 and released it to the public in the 50s. They haven't come up with anything better for cancer treatment/prevention/cure since then. There are billions of dollars in treatments that there's no real reason to update, because their main goal is to make sure you don't die to keep spending money.",Captain_Emo,5v3qif
7,If you fear meds but are suffering too much consider ECT. I know many people including two doctors who do this because they can't work through the mental fog the meds create.,NZT-48Rules,5v3qif
8,"For several years my libido was basically non-existent because of the medication I was taking at that point. I think back then I initially took a combination of quetiapine and paroxetine. But even while changing meds, the effects did not seem to wear off, or maybe the meds to which I switched just did the exact same. During these years I had different boyfriends and engaged in sexual activity, but I never felt like a pleasure or activity which I enjoyed. I just had sex because I thought that was what the other person wanted, and I did not mind doing it. It is not as if I felt uncomfortable having sex, it was just this kind of a numb feeling, more or less.

Now I have been continuously switching meds, and during the last couple of months or so, I started to notice that these feelings returned, almost completely. Now I do not know which med exactly caused this change, or which switch did, as I have tried up to 20 meds so far and was always put on different meds combined. But I am currently on a combination of valproate + methylphenidate + prothipendyl + mirtazapine (+ ocasionally olanzapine and clotiapine) and I notice little to no sexual side-effects as of now. I have been on this combination of meds for a couple of months now.

I think the biggest problem in the past was the quetiapine, regarding my sex drive, but other meds could have also contributed. I know it is not a fun thing and can cause a lot of trouble regarding relationships and so on. But knowing that I am on a combination of anticonvulsant (mood stabilizer), antipsychotics and an antidepressant and the sexual side-effects went away anyway, might be a good sign, as there will probably also be medication which will not cause these side-effects for you. The road to finding the right one for you might not be an easy one, but for me the risks outweigh all of this trouble once something that properly works for me will be found. For me personally, if the sexual side-effects never went away, I would still be okay with it in some regards. I either had the choice between quitting meds and killing myself, or being able to continue my life be it with these side-effects.",itstimeyouhadthetalk,5v3qif

10,"Actually they didnt jump on it--Look up the story of Gepirone. 

It technically got approved last year in 2016 actually but it was trying to get approval for a while. Some places seem to say that its due to the SSRI market itself actually and it would have been 'threat' to it. Sounds conspiracy theory-ish but I do believe that haha. 

And today I still don't see it available in the market for some reason. Wonder if the company just ran out of $$$ from trying to approve it for so long.

 ""In addition to its antidepressant and anxiolytic properties, gepirone has been found to improve symptoms of sexual dysfunction in men and women, similarly to the marketed 5-HT1A receptor agonist flibanserin.[3][4] Moreover, the pro-sexual effects appear to be independent of its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects.[3][4]""",lightstreaker2,5v3qif

6,"This might not be exactly what you're looking for (since it still comes under ""medicines"" I guess) but getting my iron levels in check was life changing. If you can afford it, I'd recommend getting a blood test to see if any of your vitamin/mineral/etc levels are lower than they should be. I feel a million times better when I remember to take my iron, vit c, and vit d tablets. But remember that if you're not lacking a certain vitamin, taking that vitamin will do nothing for you. For example, if your vitamin c levels are fine but you take vit c tablets anyway, you'll literally just piss out the excess. Which is why I recommend the blood test so you're not taking something unnecessarily. 

Also, unironically, make jokes about how cool you are. Even if you don't believe them. Stumble when you're walking? say something like ""wow, look how smooth I am today!"" instead of ""guess I'm so dumb I can't even walk straight"". Yes it'll be sarcastic. No, you won't believe it.

The second thing was my old job working at a Walmart. I was given more responsibilities that put me in positions where I was helping others. This job wasn't only great exercise, but it helped me build my confidence back.

Another thing that can have a huge impact is your understanding of your own psychology. Like what your mental health issue is, how it forms, and how you reinforce it.

Understanding bias is helpful. Especially your ability to notice confirmation bias. Repeating bad thoughts or messages your brain soaks up while avoiding opposing ones. Learning to control your attention will teach to control parts of your mind you didn't know you could.

Lastly another good one is dopamine detox or simply avoiding overstimulation in general.

1) find YOUR meaning of life, there is no one set meaning, what makes your life worth living?


2) take off the mask, be yourself, it hurts at first, but it feels so freeing and amazing.


3) kill the part of you that is cocky. It only destroys you, but do not destroy your confidence.


4) set a goal, do not say you’re gonna get a solid gold car within a month, put away whatever money you can each month, and save. Notice there is no deadline, and it isn’t unachievable.


5) notice beauty and struggle, life is yin and yang, sweet and sour, spicy and savoury, there is bad and good. Notice how individually they are overwhelming, but bring them together and it’s a beautiful balance.

6) embrace nature, nature is beautiful and perfectly imperfect. Connect with it, the feeling is so good, forage, climb trees, swim in a river, walk in mud, watch bugs, whatever it is, connect.


7) notice the “demon.” This demon that hides in shadows and cannot seem to be defeated, he or she is strong, you lock it away but it ALWAYS comes back stronger. Well, STOP fearing it. It ISN’T a monster, it is an aspect of you, it is not you, but part of you.

Regular exercise. Just 20-30 min 5-6 times a week. Nothing heavier fancy, sometimes just a walk. But it affects your brain chemistry very strongly and in a good way. 

Understanding mindfulness and practicing it daily. Understanding that most people in the world are doing the best they can. Accepting reality for what it is. Not allowing myself to feel sorry for myself for too long. 

Starting a real hobby that keeps me busy when my brain is on overload. I started doing pottery because it's calm and slow and it helps with the overfiring of signals in my brain.

Being able to recognize and catch myself when I'm in a negative thought cycle. Trying to play devil's advocate with myself.. do my emotions really match the situation? Should I really be this upset over something so small?

Medication does not ""Fix"" you. It simply allows lessens the effect of a disorder to allow you learn to cope with it.

Eg, depression medication doesn't make you happy, it suppresses your brains ability to get stuck in self deprecating logical loops, so you can focus on rebuild yourself and your image, as well as the world around you, instead of the prison within.

ADHD medication doesn't make you focus better. It fills in the dopamine deficiency in your brain that causes you to be easily distracted. Your ability to however, to properly manage task, and build support to get things done, is still something you need to develop, and medication allows you to do it.

154,"Hands down - mindfulness meditation. I am a licensed therapist and admittedly have recommended meditation to people for years without ever engaging in it myself for a sustained period of time. During COVID I started doing the 365 meditation on Headspace and as ridiculous as this sounds, it feels like magic. I'm a highly sensitive person who suffer from anxiety, depression, and have some challenges dealing with intense emotions. After a sustained period of time (2 weeks or so) I just find myself going through life with a much more regulated nervous system (regardless of how much I'm exercising or if I'm not eating ""healthy""). The other day I started crying happy tears in my kitchen because I had a small flash of this feeling of ""happiness"" and feeling present in my life. I felt a glimmer of who I was before COVID and all the negative impacts the past 3 years have had on my life. I have only been doing the meditations routinely again since Jan 2nd. It's this subtle noticing that I can handle difficult conversations better (I don't even recognize myself during some interactions because I handle them so much better).

Secondly, when I can tell myself I'd like to stick to something and then I stick to it at all costs (unless I'm in legitimate danger, and trust me... my mind will try to find any excuse to resist consistency), I feel so much better. Being able to be consistent with myself is huge for my mental health. There's something about not self-abandoning when I don't feel like doing something or feel uncomfortable (but not in legitimate danger) that has significantly improved my mental health. And these don't even have to be big things for me. Last 6 months of last year I set a goal to floss my teeth every Monday/Wednesday/Friday. I can't tell you how many times I tried  talking myself out from having to do it. Sticking with it always supported me in feeling better overall and anytime I'd self-abandon and crawl into bed because I just didn't feel like doing it, when the internal resistance won, I'd always feel poorly. Now I have successfully flossed my teeth every day since Jan 1 (yep, this was my new years resolution :-P) and I genuinely feel proud of myself because of the consistency, as small as it might seem.

Also, anytime I am in connection with people who love and care about me, my mood significantly improves. It's sooooo soooo sooo hard for me to be around people when I don't feel mentally well. And time and time again, when I do the opposite of what my depression tells me to do, and I spend time with people who love me, I feel so much better. And life gets put into perspective a bit better for me (it's good to get outside of my  own head as often as possible).

I’m 6 months sober and on step 4 and 5. I’ve noticed changes along the way, but at this point my life is drastically changing for the better. Internally and externally. 

I look at going to meetings and staying with AA as taking my medicine. Similar to my mood stabilizer. If I want to be well, I need to take my medicine. I plan to stay with AA for the entirety of my life, and that sounds wonderful to me.

From there I will give it some compassion. I will tell that part of me / myself that ""I am going to be ok"", ""it is going to be ok"". And I try to breathe into the spot where I feel it. And the whole time I am really trying to observe the sensation, not resist or fight it.

I've been on NUMEROUS medications, so many that I sometimes forget which ones I've previously taken, and my experience has been nearly identical to yours. They numb things down, but that's about it. Some of the things I want to numb down, of course, however I find that it numbs even the positive things which is...problematic, since I feel that without those positive feelings my life just feels worse. 

So far, I *think* anti-psychotics have been the most affective for me? I was on Quetiapine before for sleep and I remember feeling pretty good, however the increased appetite wasn't something I expected and I gained weight which scared me, so I requested a medication change. Currently I'm on a new anti-psychotic (Risperidone) which I started a few days ago, and I'm coming off of Effexor for side-effect reasons. If I notice any drastic positives from starting Risperidone I'll let you know (provided I remember...which isn't very likely \^\_\^'').

A year seems like plenty of time to evaluate if a medication is working for you.  Dosage and time of day should be discussed as well.  Some medications work better taken in the morning vs night assuming you operate on a ""9 to 5"" type schedule.  Your (typical) daily routine is something your Dr should be aware of.

Keep in mind, the next medication may not be any better.  You will have to go through the titrate down/up phase, and the adjustment to a new med.  This means a commitment to see the process through and it can be very tough.  That isn't to meant to scare from change but acknowledge the work that is involved in maintaining a healthier you.

My current meds aren't perfect but compared to what I've taken in the past, they are working well enough for me.  I still have symptoms of depression & anxiety pretty often but they are much more reigned in to where I can spot them and manage as opposed to being overwhelmed by an unexpected tidal wave.

Unless you're schizophrenic, a lot of times people are unnecessarily placed on pharmaceutical drugs, which by the way kill 100,000 people annually IN HOSPITAL SETTINGS ALONE. (Source: FDA/CDC) 
Depression can stem from lack of social support, disconnection from family and friends, low self esteem together with poor diet you've got a recipe for disaster.
Now I'm not telling you to go off your meds or anything silly like that.
I'm suggesting you look at the whole picture of your life.
Do you eat healthy and have a healthy gut? An unhealthy gut can lead to pretty severe depression. Do you eat a lot of refined sugar and carbs? Soda? HFCS? What about exercise? Are you getting enough exercise, sunlight and sleep? Do you have a healthy work/life balance? Do you have worthwhile goals you're pursuing? Is your family supportive? 

Modern medicine simply puts a bandaid on us. It doesn't attempt to address the root cause and actually fix the problem because once a patient is ""cured"" they no longer need the Medical Cartel! 

I found that my diet/exercise, lack of a stimulating and rewarding career and a highly toxic relationship were the cause of my woes.

A good course of action here is for the doc to prescribe you something like an SSRI (like Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro, etc) which as you said will take roughly a month to take full effect, then a benzo to take as needed during that month. Benzodiazepines were never really intended for long term use. 

I also would not advise you tell the doctor you want Xanax and nothing else (or anything else along those lines). Like I said, it’s addicting, and you will come off as drug seeking (even though I know you’re not).

Thanks... been stressed so thanks for being patient. :) And thanks for the info.

Okay, I’ll look into Xanax for basically an emergency anxiety medication?

And I’ll be happy to get an SSRI to help me obviously become less depressed. :)

So is it appropriate to ask for doctor for an anti-anxiety medication (like Xanax) and an SSRI?

A few questions:

* Will the doctor ask/care about why I’m depressed? Basically I had a lot of family issues going on and well, my feelings were invalidated with my parents and other abusive stuff, so the doctor might even send APS if I explicitly define what happened. I’ll eventually work out that issue with a therapist when I have the time but I don’t want to deal with the fallout right now.

* It will take about 4 weeks before I feel the antidepressant, right? Something to be aware of.

* No doctor will care about my intrusive thoughts because they’ve heard them a million times, right? I just heard horror stories of someone with intrusive thoughts being misinterpreted as psychotic and hastily been written an antipsychotic script so... my fear. Though I agree that’s the worst case scenario.",ThrowawayT0,ajvqrp
5,"The best course of action is to tell the doc as much about your symptoms as you can (I recommend writing it down because you’ll forget stuff when sitting in front of him) and let him decide what the best thing to prescribe is. As the patient, it shouldn’t be on you to figure out what medication you need. You can ask questions like “how soon should I expect to see an improvement with this medication” and “is there anything you can prescribe as a short-term bridge until that takes effect?” Xanax and other benzos are as you said - intended for emergencies or known acute stressors (like flying on an airplane). It’s not healthy to start to rely on them because you’ll lose touch with other coping skills. 

A good doc should ask a little about what’s going on in your life. The reason is because medication won’t do much for someone who’s depression/ anxiety are situational - ex. “I got fired then my dog died then my house burned down.” You should expect him to ask you about the history of your symptoms (when did they start, what was going on at that time, have they gotten better or worse as time has passed, etc). Im not sure what you mean about APS. Are you over 18? And if so, is your concern that they would call APS to protect you (not likely - APS is generally only called for “vulnerable adults” such as the elderly and people with intellectual disabilities if they are in some kind of danger)

Yes most antidepressants take around 4 weeks to be effective but it varies from drug to drug and some people experience improvements right away (placebo effect)

Many people who have depression and anxiety experience intrusive thoughts and this is no reason to prescribe an antipsychotic.

4,"If anyone else is reading this thread, note that OP emphasizes the credentials of (unnamed) energy medicine proponents. That a doctor or therapist endorses a treatment, unfortunately, in no way guarantees that there is solid evidence that it actually works. 

Consider the case of therapeutic touch, a form of energy medicine that, oddly enough, doesn't actually involve touching patients—practictioners claim they can sense a ""human energy field"" around patients, which they also claim to be able to manipulate to patients' benefit. This was (and, unfortunately, continues to be) a controversial therapy generally not accepted by the broader medical community that was difficult to study because its practitioners refused to participate in studies with the potential to show that it was ineffective. 

Enter Emily Rosa, a 4th grader, who upon seeing a video about therapeutic touch decided to conduct a simple experiment for her science fair to see whether therapeutic touch practitioners could in fact feel human energy fields:

>The study tested the ability of 21 TT practitioners to detect the HEF when they were not looking. Rosa asked each of the practitioners to sit at a table and extend their hands through a screen. On the other side of the screen, Rosa randomly selected which of the TT practitioners' hands she would hold her hand over. The TT practitioners were then asked which of their hands detected Rosa's HEF. Subjects were each given ten tries, but they correctly located Rosa's hand an average of only 4.4 times.  (Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily\_Rosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Rosa))

Long story short (feel free to click through to wikipedia for more details), after Rosa's science fair, a friend of the family suggested Rosa attempt to publish her results, with the outcome of Rosa becoming the youngest author to be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

There are plenty of other resources on the (lack of) evidence for the efficacy of energy medicine. If anyone's curious, [this collection of articles](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/category/energy-medicine/) at Science Based Medicine is a great place to start.

I went through 12 weeks of emotion regulation group sessions and learned some skills to help manage all emotions. It was really helpful. I learned that other people feel this way too. I was able to begin to sense what I was feeling in my body prior to having an emotional outburst. And learn to focus less on negative emotions and more on positive.

0,"Your friend may be studying medicine, but clearly they haven't learned yet just how unethical it is to ""armchair diagnose"" their friends, coworkers, etc. This friend is not your medical provider. They don't know your complete medical history. They're doing you a huge disservice by giving you this kind of advice. 

How does this friend know your Abilify wasn't prescribed for something besides BPD? Abilify is FDA-approved to treat quite a few things besides BPD. 

You should definitely have an honest conversation with your doctor regarding your concerns about your meds, their side effects, your symptoms, etc.  Your doctor can help you make adjustments to ensure the meds are working for you. Please don't stop cold turkey, as many meds need to be tapered off to avoid causing worse side effects.

I know it's easier said than done, but try not to worry about other people's opinions about your mental health. Like my Dad used to say, ""Opinions are like assholes... everyone has one.""  Just don't talk with your friends about your meds or your diagnoses if they can't be respectful and keep their opinions to themselves.",BlergToDiffer,eb3n9u

Now if you're feeling like a zombie and having other side effects then you should definitely talk to your psychiatrist about trying a different option or changing the dosage.

People wanted to armchair doctor my mental illnesses a lot too, saying what it was and what it couldn’t be and I was stupid enough to listen to them instead of getting help and I ended up in the hospital because i physiologically wrecked myself.

1,"There's a lot you can do without medications. Some things proven to work are; meditation, 30 minutes of walking a day, yoga, exercise in general, eating enough dark leafy greens, eating a nutritious diet in general, avoiding alcohol and drugs, spending time with others, volunteering, etc. I didn't want to go on medication so I did all of these things religiously for 8 months before I'd let myself  start taking an antidepressant. While those things did help a lot I wish I had let myself start meds earlier because I truly need them but a part of me is glad I tried to do it without them because now I never have to wonder about it. Medication won't magically fix everything of course and my experience has been that I feel like my best self when I combine a healthy lifestyle with my meds.

If depression or stress in your case is caused by some sort of inflammation, it might help a little. Don't take more than small doses, however, since aspirin can cause bleeding, and ibuprofen can mess up your stomach/liver.

I've been pretty lucky that i haven't had to switch around with my meds too much. But i have gotten them increased as needed.

I started by just taking zoloft. That worked for me for about 6 months. Somethings in my life changes and so i got the doseage increased a few times. That helped but i found even with the increase it just wasn't quite enough. I felt better, but it didn't seem to last as long as i needed it to.

Wellbutrin was added completing my current med cocktail. This one has really made a difference for me. It's also nice bexause they have different types i guess you could say. They have your standard capsules and extended release tablets. I take the extended release tablet. It really helps to ensure the effect of the medication last.

Something i've also found is the time in which you take your meds. I take zoloft before bed because it can cause me to be a bit drowzy. I take the wellbutrin before work because it both lasts longer and makes me less drowzy than the zoloft.

It takes time to find what works for you. I even question at times if what i'm taking IS the best choice. Don't be afraid to ask your doctor about the different types of medications available. You can even go online and look at the different types. Each medications works in it's own way. If the side effects are make you feel the medication isn't the best choice, say something. You can totally find meds that work for you with side effect that you can work with, if it has and real side effects at all.

The hardest thing was making the decision that enough was enough. I decided I needed to start over and go from there, so I went off of everything that I was on (safely, which was hard enough). After I was off everything for a few weeks, I found out that I needed something, so I got a referral to a new psychiatrist. 

It was nice- the first time I saw her she looked at my med history and basically said wtf was this idiot doing? She then explained to me why she didn't think what he did made sense, what her outlook and process was, and then what she thought we should do next. She also explained two different options and let me decide which one I wanted to go with. I chose one, and we started. I don't know how long it will take to find the right meds, but I think it will go better with the new psychiatrist.

I just want to say that it does make a difference when you can talk to, trust, etc the psychiatrist that you're seeing. The guy I saw for the last two years I felt that I couldn't really talk to him, he didn't really listen when I did, and that I was just going nowhere. I accepted it for so long because I know that getting the right meds is not an exact science, and everyone is different, and it does take time. But, with that being said, you need to trust who you're seeing and if you're trying so many things that aren't working, you need to re-assess and see what your other options are.

Changing meds is extremely taxing. Not only does it take sometimes months to see any sort of real change while your body gets used to the meds, but you can also have withdrawals from your old medications. 

It sounds to me like your doctor might not be a great fit for you. It sounds like they were not very supportive of you or really listened to your concerns. Finding the right doctor is a huge part of the battle. 

It can be extremely discouraging to try and find the right meds. It is a huge process and can be quite lengthy. Don’t give up. Once you do find the right combination, things really do start to look up. 

Don’t forget that talk therapy, a good sleep schedule, and a healthy diet can have a considerable effect on you. I am not in any way saying you don’t need meds- but I have found that weekly therapy along with my psych meds has made a huge difference.

At the lowest dose of seroquel I was sleeping 16 hours a day and I immediately started craving food. At the highest dose I could easily sleep for 24 hours straight. Seroquel is an antipsychotic and regardless of the sedating properties should not be used just for sleep issues without exhausting all other avenues. The sedating antihistamine options available in the UK are far less likely to cause long term issues such as an underactive thyroid or weight related diabetes which is a common long term effect of many antipsychotics. I don't like benzos as a sleeping aid because they are addictive as you say, but in some people (myself included) they have a paradoxical effect and don't work at all. Discussion of sleep routine and good sleep hygiene and a short term course of something mildly sedating should be the first option.

0,"First thing you should probably do is go to a professional for some advice, for example a psychiatrist. You will need someone certified to get an official diagnoses anyway. Based on the things in your post you could suffer from OCD and/or ADD, but there is no way for other people on the internet to tell you for sure.

Also, medication is definitely something that will not solve these issues by itself. It is always always to treat the symptoms you talk about in combination with a therapy programme or counselling in some way or another. This is even more important in case you would be put on medication for ADD, because stimulants such as Ritalin, for example, is medication that will work for a couple of hours only and your symptoms will just return once it wears off and may even become worse. So it is important to understand your issues, to find/learn/practise new ways to cope with them and to be able to talk about them with someone else.

That said, I have experienced similar things. I think I do not have an official diagnosis of OCD, but I do suffer from compulsory behaviour quite a lot. For example, there are certain actions which I have a perform a certain amount in order for it to feel “right” in my mind, even when it makes no sense. I exhibit a lot of repetitive behaviour because otherwise it gives me an anxious feeling. I also do tings such as counting in a lot of situations, for example stairs or tiles or food, and so on. When I walk on a road my mind forces me to avoid the cracks of the tiles or only allows me to walk on certain parts. When I was younger I had more severe issues concerning this. For example, there was a time when I felt the compulsive need to destroy items or steal items, even though it made me feel bad afterwards. Sometimes I also had thoughts occurring which would tell me to do bad things, but I never really acted on them.

I was officially diagnosed with ADD recently and was put on Ritalin in order to help me focussing on tasks and help with my memory issues. I get immediately distracted by everything around  me whenever I try to perform a task and then end up doing basically everything beside what I am actually supposed to be doing. And then eventually this lead me to doing almost nothing at all anymore, because this process was so time-consuming and took so much energy while I ended up without any results. My head became so cluttered with thoughts that I forgot to do the most basic tasks or just could not force myself to finish them, such as checking my mail or paying bills and I would just get myself in trouble ending up with dozens of phone calls I had to make, no food at home because I did not do any groceries again, laundry stacking up, and so on.

Now when it comes to medication. I have been on a lot of meds during the course of a couple of years. These include a lot antidepressants, antipsychotics and anticonvulsants. So far I have not noticed any positive changes when it comes to my OCD-behaviour, but this is able to be treated with medication. I just do not react very correct to medication. But as I said, combining this with therapy is recommended to understand why you exhibit certain behaviour and you can work on your (underlying) fears. For me the Ritalin helps me in the sense that it makes it easier for me to focus on a single task and I am distracted a bit less quick. It is not a miraculous solution whatsoever, but I do notice effects and I immediately notice my house is messier when I am not on it and I postpone tasks I should be doing a lot more. Where I live doctors and psychiatrist do not easily put someone on something like Ritalin, however, but the results from the testings I got done turned out to be pretty abominable and they decided I needed medication support in order to function properly.

The symptoms which you describe seem severe enough to seek professional help for this, and it probably would be a positive thing for you to get diagnostics done so you can understand what is going on and you can get proper treatment to fight these symptoms.
