1,"I'm a therapist and I agree with everything you've said. I'm not a CBT therapist, I use the Humanistic/Person-Centred approach. CBT does have it's place but it's always seemed like a surface level therapy to me. It aims to change negative thought patterns, which is great, but it often doesn't delve into *why* someone has those negative thought patterns. The Person-Centred approach looks at things like conditions of worth, the self concept, the self actualising tendency, etc. Personally I feel that gives much deeper healing than simply changing someone's thinking. In my opinion it also helps for longer. CBT can give quick symptom reduction, but if you don't focus on the why then that won't last.",TheCounsellingGamer,nwmpz1
2,"I think my therapist got fed up with me and eventually said ""sometimes you gotta fake it til you make it"" or some such variation. I was doing CBT with her and trying my best. Doing the damn diary cards. But sometimes if I went on and on about some problems or issues I was experiencing, she would just resign with these little quips like ""I wish I could wave a magic wand and fix it but it's going to take work..."" Years later after leaving them and the program I did more research about CBT and found that a lot of the jargon and quips and phrases she used were like, word for word from the original (author? Creator?) Of CBT and I felt really put out. Like damn, I wasn't connecting to and receiving counseling from a professional who was trying to help and understand me, I was just being fed lines from a book. Idk why I wrote all this. I guess just to say that it wasn't until I read your post that I didn't even stop to consider that maybe that particular therapist and doing CBT wasn't good for me. 



That therapist and I abruptly ended on a weird note and I always felt guilty about it and felt like I was a failure who didn't finish the program. Like I was really messed up because I couldn't do it or understand? Now I regret spending so much money out of pocket to see them. Thank you for sharing your thoughts, OP.",FraudFr0g,nwmpz1
3,"My exact feelings OP, couldn't agree more. I'm coming off 7 months with a PhD psychologist who tries to jam CBT theory down my throat but then, when I'm just trying to vent, be heard, and get feedback, he dismisses it and talks about himself. In one ear and out the other. I suggest any other therapeutic method and he whines about CBT having the most research done. I threaten him with leaving (indirectly) and he whines about how it takes time, and then starts to read out of a CBT textbook as if more theory is what I need. Over reliance on it. 

The guy I was with before him, a much younger lmsw who at the time was an employee of the PhD, threw CBT elements in there but often actually listened to me and communicated with me human to human. He was MUCH more helpful than his boss has been.",Sweatygun,nwmpz1
4,"I totally see where you're coming from.. Lots of people in my life have told me to just deal with it or just get over it, and it's not that simple. I've been told ""just don't think about it,"" ""think positive thoughts"" and ""just stop getting so flustered all the time."" when it's not that easy! This mindset, if anything, is what's preventing me from getting a proper diagnosis and treatment for my suspected Bipolar disorder. I know my body better than anyone, and I'm sure you do too, so my suspicions are most likely right seeing as though I've had multiple people point out my symptoms and I lived for years being unsure of my condition, thinking I was a sociopath or a monster. CBT and Positive Psychology doesn't always work, and I totally agree with you because my years of mental illness won't simply go away with some positive juju. Sure, I can treat it and regulate it with SOME changes in my mindset, but it's mental. Sometimes it takes over and relapses and I need a different kind of treatment for that, because everyone is different and mental illness can't be ""cured"".",NegativeRock6733,nwmpz1
5,"Hello friend, I think you raise an excellent point. I wanted to provide the perspective of someone practicing mental health support to shed a light on why it is the case, at least where I am from (uk). I am not a qualified therapist but here we have a more junior position that I do, whilst I work alongside a variety of qualified therapists in a range of disciplines (art therapy, drama therapy, psychodynamic and CBT). In my role I deliver CBT based therapeutic work for my clients. As I have progressed I have encountered the situations you describe- trying to work through CBT excercises with people who's situation is not able to be thought out of, people in abusive households and in lots of cases, people who just need someone to listen to them and take them seriously for maybe the first time in their life. I work with a supervisor who is trained in more psychodynamic approaches and we have excellent case discussions about my clients but that I can not implement many of because I'm limited to CBT. 

The reason for the prevalence of CBT based therapy appears to be it's ability to generate 'outcome data'. Unfortunately, for my role I spend an immense amount of time inputting various self report measures and, most  importantly for justification of our funding, goal measures (I.e. client achieved a goal they set out). CBT in this format can be great because it supposedly shows if the therapy 'worked'. While training I met some of the key people who pushed this agenda in the UK and essentialy their reasoning was forgivable- they wanted to get government funded mental health services as far reaching and available as they could, so the choice for CBT (and the CBT lite sort of thing I do) was a pragmatic choice as it can reduce the amount of time needed to train us as well as be somewhat effective for some people.

So while it is all about money really, in what will be able to be justified for funding, one thing my first supervisor told me was comforting. Apparently it has been demonstrated that regardless of the approach used, the most predictive thing for seeing progress is a positive therapeutic relationship between client and therapist- and ironically this was a huge part of Carl Rogers (CBT founder) original ethos. Unfortunately we now get a lot of diluted therapeutic options (too short, too narrowly focused etc) and I do fear this is combined with a batch of young practitioners like myself, who simply see 'evidence based' as meaning 'the best' and who focus too much on worksheets, thought challenging etc and forget the importance of being a person with another person.",oraclekneepads,nwmpz1
6,"Great post. It’s a common mistake for new therapists or therapists who have been working with more affluent populations.

If we assess that the cognitions (Ex: Poverty is awful, Racism is happening, etc) are accurate and based in reality we don’t need to reframe our thinking, we need to explore where we do have agency and address issues related to problem solving and accessing resources. And also a lot of needed validation. 

On a more macro level, therapists can’t solve large scale societal issues like wealth inequality. This is where the role of advocacy and organizing comes in.

There is a book called “Unfaithful Angels” that you might find interesting about how direct practice clinicians end up being a bandaid to large scale social problems.",justhanginhere,nwmpz1

8,"Honestly I think part of the problem isn't *just* CBT.  It's that mental health research has had a tendency to be done by and on people who are largely middle class and in secure situations.  And it's been done with a highly individualized and medicalized mindset, where therapy is conceived of as fixing a disorder that is wrong with the person.  And CBT was developed very heavily within that mindset.  And it's complicated by that if a therapist hasn't been in poverty, or in an abusive relationship, some things that may seem obvious to them aren't actually viable options for you.  So their training encourages them to see it as a problem with your thinking, not with their understanding.",WarKittyKat,nwmpz1

15,"This is why I chose a therapist who doesn't use CBT. I'm sick of people trying to apply it where it's not helpful or when you specifically say that you don't want to do CBT and someone attempts to use it on you regardless.

It's kind of made me avoid practitioners who are classed as clinical psychologists as they mostly tend to use CBT or combine it with other methods. 

Instead I look for therapists who usually use a mix of person centered and Psychodynamic therapy.  That's your traditional talk therapy where you're off loading and receiving empathy from your therapist as well as talking about your past and your therapist helping you understand how childhood issues are impacting you today. 

There's no ""homework"" assigned to you and you're the one who gets to set the agenda for each session on most occasions.",,nwmpz1

They’re typically trained in 4-8 years of a specific theoretical model (CBT, Humanistic, Family Systems, Psychoanalytic, etc).

19,"I agree with you! I need to deal with some serious ptsd issues. Like almost 5 years of childhood abuse. And when I finally had the courage to bring it up to my therapist I want to work on it she told me that by avoiding the place where the abuse happened was just making worse for me. Like I need to head over to the house little bits at a time so I won’t fear it any more. That I’m creating more fear about and making it worse for myself. I get that I’ll probably need to face it but what about validating my fears now that I’m not ready? 
Or easing me into it? Or just help me get through the emotions and trauma and be understanding if I never want to return to the scene of the crime. 
Or she pushes journaling on me and I don’t want to write shit down and have people find it. But when I try and tell things that work for me they aren’t good enough. Okay that’s my vent over",Allymadscience,nwmpz1
20,"Hey, CBT therapist here. I agree with your point that A. CBT isn’t for everyone and B. Therapists should be person-centered and ask their patient what they’re seeking out of therapy. CBT is predominantly utilized with individuals who have OCD, anxiety, ADHD and autism, however it can be advantageous for other populations too! As someone who grew up in extreme poverty, who also has bipolar disorder and ocd, I found CBT to be very helpful as a child. I think that when working with patients who do have extreme environmental stressors/traumas, that the first thing to do with the patient is address basic needs being met. If your therapist doesn’t happen to be a social worker, a referral to one would be useful in that situation (sometimes even if they are, it’s useful to refer you to someone whose job is more case-management based). However. The traumas that go along with poverty cannot always immediately be addressed. People often utilize defense mechanisms to deal with chronic poverty and/or other traumas (denial, repression, etc) so sometimes it’s advantageous to get people more stabilized before real trauma work begins. I also want to say that yes, even people in poverty can benefit from CBT depending on their reason for seeking treatment. Positive psychology would be absolutely useless under these circumstances, however, CBT isn’t simply just minimized to “change your thoughts” and if that’s how your practitioner is making it seem, it’s not true CBT. CBT has intensive behavioral components which involve behavioral modification planning, homework, and a lot of cognitive restructuring which is not to simply say “change your mind”, but is meant to assess where a thought comes from, assessing why it’s there, when else in life does it occur, and what truth/falsehoods come from this thought? How does it change my behavior? Where did I learn this? Like I said, as someone who grew up in poverty and with more serious mental health issues: I get it. And maybe your therapist isn’t for you, maybe they aren’t modeling the therapy properly, or maybe your environmental needs need to be met first before you can practice a therapeutic technique like CBT, but don’t give up on therapy just yet! There are alway more therapists out there, congratulations on seeking out a therapist and trying something new to improve your mental health! It’s really hard to focus on therapy or benefit fully when you’re in poverty and every day is so stressful and challenging. Also, great job advocating for your needs to your therapist. Super important- never stop doing this. I wish you luck",scorpiomoon17,nwmpz1
21,"this makes me feel validated because whenever i talk to people about how hard it is for me to find a therapist who actually helps me (my current one is on maternity leave, and i may not be able to go back to her), they say things like ‘well you’re never gonna find someone to help if you think that way” but really what i mean is the approach of many many therapists doesn’t work for me. CBT feels fake idk. or i expend way too much energy trying to implement the ‘homework’ because i’m depressed/adhd, and then i fail and it becomes even worse. i think my most recent therapist really just listens to me, observes, takes notes, and then asks guiding questions to help me get to the root of the issues that i can’t clearly see. i have made so much progress with her, after seeing 10+ therapists before that with little to no success. idk what to do at this point… as right now i’m avoiding trying to find a therapist….

22,"Agree 100%. It further bothers me when people who don't have mental illnesses but avail therapy for shorter terms, due to stress management or other such non-clinical and non-severe challenges, become evangelists of CBT and ""openly talking about therapy"" and feeling proud of themselves for it. Therapy should be open to all and people should avail them for whatever reasons they have. But it annoys me because they do not face the stigma of mental illness, esp chronic and debilitating effects on one's life. CBT and its techniques can be helpful, but I've found that its very symptomatic in its approach. It did not work for me and I don't find it working for people with severe illness or severe issues like you said. It also depends on the country because, where I live, psychologists mainly practice CBT and are not licensed to prescribe medication as they do not go through traditional medical training. Most anti-psychotics and SSRIs are NOT available over the counter either. 

With more awareness about mental health issues and therapy, I find there is such an abyss between an understanding of mental health and mental illness. Everyone claims to have anxiety and feeling depressed and it's the sign of the times, but it starts to dilute clinical and chronic mental illness representation. Idk if I sound bitter but I honestly find there are quite a few problems to such widespread ""awareness"" about mental health, as positive as it seems.",hellohibyebye13,nwmpz1

31,"Makes sense. I also don't  like the ""one size fits all"" approach. 

I've done many types of therapy and they were all useful in their own way. I like to approach a therapy with the intention of doing a ""piece of work"" -as my past drama therapist would say. 

I've worked with DBT, CBT, Mindfulness Group Meditation, Gestalt therapy, Drama therapy and Psychodynamic therapy. I even saw a shaman-style therapist for a while and that really knocked my socks off. I also got a lot out of doing Psychedelics with friends in safe spaces. 

It can be difficult to find low-income opportunities for different types of therapy. I was somewhat lucky to be exposed to alternative methods, since I was in a Masters program that focused on Transpersonal Psychology. There are students in training there who offer free to low-fee workshops that most people can get involved in. The trouble is finding an ""in."" I recommend reaching out to students in counseling or Psychology programs in your area and asking if there is anything available. I also found a lot of cool stuff by walking around campus to the bulletin boards and looking at the flyers. A lot of new therapists don't do a great job with advertising their workshops and services. It also helps to do a bit of research into therapeutic models that seem interesting to you. If you find a book that you like, try to see about emailing the author for referrals in your area for clinicians who specialize in the specific modality.

I was assigned a Person-Centred therapist by a free agency, (I wasn't given a choice of the type of therapy). It didn't work out too well for me; all they ever did was active listening, literally repeating everything I said back to me with zero comment of their own week after week.

I tried to speak to them about it, told them that it made me feel the opposite of 'heard' or empathised with, they didn't change, so I asked to be assigned to someone else who practiced a different approach. They gave me another Person-Centred therapist who said she was much more 'interactive', but she did exactly the same and nothing else, despite me bringing up how unhelpful I found it.

So my question is - is this what proper Person-Centred Therapy looks like, or was it just horrendously poorly executed PCT?",Knick_Knick,nwmpz1

61,"THANK YOU!! The why is what I’ve been looking to explore. I’ve finally found a therapist who’s having me explore the roots to my insecurities and while she says she doesn’t want me to label myself, I will say that with no professional experience or education, I think I am a person with borderline personality. I have 7/9 traits. I need help. I understand how to calm myself down. I can think rationally. I catch my negative thoughts. But I want to break through and get deeper. I know I had a traumatic and neglectful childhood. But I don’t want to see myself as a victim or be alone for the rest of my life. I need more than CBT. I’ve had years of it.",,nwmpz1

Especially with them directly putting the blame on you, by telling you they cant fix *your* problems. Even if you were the one holding back, there were millions of nicer ways the therapist could of said it. Sounds like more of the therapist’s issue and not your own

We often forget that therapists are not some godly being and are humans like us, who can be tired, flawed and even cruel. I’ve heard of a lot of terrible therapists, who got the degree but just didn’t care for their clients. Its bad enough having to find A therapist, but finding the right one?

64,"I would argue mental illness can be cured for some people and greatly decreased in others and tends to do that naturally over time, with or without treatment, based on studies I've read. At the same time I agree with you that (being someone who is also diagnosed with Bipolar) that sometimes treatment needs to go beyond CBT and Positive Psychology when symptoms are worse. That could include medication, but doesn't have to. My overall point is that all therapists are trained in multiple modalities and treatment should reflect the needs of the patient/client, not the specialization of the therapist. In my opinion person-centered approach, systems theory, and compassion based therapy are greatly underutilized along with trauma therapy as the biggest deficit of all.

65,"So well said! Thank you for taking the time to respond. I'm in the field as well in a position that I know also exists in some forms in the UK - Peer Support. I'm in the US, but I think the issue with funding definitely applies. Our equivalent evidence-based practice that we are forced to push most is called Wellness Recovery Action Planning or WRAP for short. It is basically a workbook of different action plans the person makes for different symptoms and situations and is very evidence-based. That does not mean it works for the majority of people it is shown to if the person presenting it doesn't use it themselves or is representing it incorrectly, just like the therapists. The relationship in Peer Support is what matters too. You have to both believe in a tool and use it where it is most appropriate for the evidence to mean anything at all. So few people understand that using both WRAP and CBT in mental health and it is a HUGE challenge with funders to get them to understand how relationships are built and maintained so that supported healing can happen.

66,"Agree 100%. As a patient in the UK the paperwork and box-ticking really irk me. The widely used depression and anxiety measurement tools the NHS use are appalling.

I wouldn't mind such inaccurate measurement lacking in nuance if it was just a rough guide for the therapist's use, but they use the results to justify funding.

At the end of my recent therapy I was sent an email saying my scores had 'improved' and that I had achieved the goals I set (I didn't set any goals, they just made some up), so now the commissioning body gets another tick in the box saying 'this is great, more funding for this type of thing' when actually my experience was terrible, and on the sickening cycle goes.

Most people who have consistent mental health treatment I've come across have Medicaid so that they can afford it. They are facing greater challenges than the average person. They should not be ignored in that sweeping mental health awareness stuff. Sure, we all have mental health to take care of, but people who face the stigma of ongoing treatment don't need to be told that everyone can relate just because they've lost someone at some point in their life and experienced grief or some such example.

And then people assume that because you’re still struggling despite treatment, you probably just aren’t trying hard enough to get better. Or that if you *just* do these simple things, like meditate for 10 mins a day, or go for a walk, or take some medication for a few months, things should improve and you can go back to living your life.

110," anti-psychiatrists are primarily against forced hospitalization and drugging of people without informed consent. especially when the problems they are having are legitimate. the mental health institutions we have today for crises are vestiges of asylums and sanatoriums. ive never been to a crisis center with therapy. i am depressed because the world is meandering towards complete collapse. i am much more likely to live a life of poverty than be upwardly mobile. those things are objectively depressing and anti-depressants seek to placate and sedate people who are dealing with real problems. people have anxiety because our lives here in the US hinge on not getting sick or having some unexpected financial setback for tons of people. that is legitimately threatening to your life. no wonder someone would have generalized anxiety when they know how little of a safety net against destitution or death we have. no fucking shit.

 i know this probably doesn't fit into your worldview, but psychiatry is not above reproach. lobotomies were considered groundbreaking and revolutionary at one time.

There's a therapist and researcher named Steve Ilardi who developed a program for depression based on a thorough study of how lifestyle affects our moods. In his book, he talks about studies of a therapy called behavior activation that treats depression with behavior change alone. That research prompted Ilardi to study the question of what what behaviors in particular help people.

Some people forget the **B** in CBT. 

If you go to Metapsychology you can read a psychologists review of the Ilardi self-help book (""splendid book"").

2,"The best thing that has worked for me is honestly accepting my depression and questioning my anxiety. 

I have accepted that depression will most likely be part of me for the rest of my life. I will have my bad times but the trick is learning how to deal with the bad times. Knowing that the bad times will pass eventually and I’ll feel okay after them. Like for example I have a hard time showering when I feel these low times but by using wet wipes and a washcloth, it makes me not feel like absolute shit for not being able to shower. 

What I mean by questioning my anxiety is questioning those anxious thoughts that run through my head. I have a fear of my disabled mom falling whenever she walks down the stairs. I recently started thinking “I’ll deal with it when or if it happens” and that has surprisingly knocked down the anxiety that comes with the “what if” question. I always thought that ignoring my feelings of anxiety was a bad coping mechanism so I tried to not ignore them. But the social worker I’ve been seeing told me something like “You’re not avoiding those feelings, you’re pushing away the negative feelings that make you feel bad” which makes sense.

The only time breathing exercises work for me is when I’m having a panic attack and I try to calm myself down. In my opinion, the best therapy is the therapy that works for you. Find what works for you.",vero_6321,1baij2t

I'm sorry, but feeling like shit because a real shitty thing happened is not a cognitive distortion. Depression just is. It just  exists. It isn't always about thoughts or situations. When I have a bad day/episode/moment with my depression, there is usually not a negative thought that goes with it. I'm not ruminating about something, I am not thinking of anything in particular. I just feel shitty. How in the hell do you CBT a thought that doesn't exist? CBT assumes you are having distorted thoughts, and that you must also be an idiot to not recognize the distortion.

3,"Mental Health Therapist here and I'm going to quote the best advice I was given on this subject: If your client's symptoms aren't improving, and they are telling you that is their goal for therapy, it is time to consider a change in approach. 

In grad school I wasn't a fan of CBT tbh. It's very structured, very manualized, and acts more like a collection of skills in a how to guide. This is for a few reason. 1: Because it's evidence based (meaning lots of research shows it works, and it does) insurances are more willing to pay for it. The thought otherwise is why would we pay for something without a certain guarantee of success? (a horrible mindset to start from, but that's a different rant). 2: There are certain diagnoses that benefit most from manualized treatment and those show up in research settings. But this is because people are sought out who the fit the criteria to show this is likely to be successful and works around them. There are a lot of variables involved that we can't account for outside of a lab setting. 

I am by no means knocking CBT, as many of the skills involved such as cognitive restructuring, relaxation techniques, behavioral activation, exposures, etc do work and are great skills to have. The thing is it's more about applications of these skills and the expectations of the client. One of the first things I ask when I see someone is: Have you had therapy before? If so what did you like and dislike about it? And if not, what are you expecting out of this experience? The difference with me, is that I am trained in various forms of CBT, but I do not claim to be a CBT therapist. It's not my primary modality like it is for many therapists. I find that this means I'm willing to be more critical of it since I don't have as strong a tie to it. If I were being really harsh, I'd argue that CBT is a cookie cutter treatment that wants circular people to fit into square holes. 


I digress, my main point here is CBT can be good for some people, but not everyone. OP if you have been to several CBT therapists and not found success there are three possible conclusions I come to without a lot of other information (so I am making assumptions): 1. You weren't ready for change. Which is normal. Most folks aren't their first time, especially if it starts earlier in their life. 2: CBT isn't conducive for the therapy you're seeking. It sounds like DBT or Trauma Focused CBT might be more of what you'd benefit from rather than more traditional CBT. There is a difference. Of course, there are also other forms of therapy. Humanistic such as Gestalt and Existential (my brand of therapy), Psychodynamic, and many others depending on someone's training. ACT in particular is good one for managing chronic health issues. 3: The relationship with the therapist wasn't well established. No matter what form of intervention used, research has shown time and again the greatest predictor of success is the therapeutic alliance. The fact of matter is however, not everyone will get along! No matter how great the therapist could be, if the relationship and therefore the trust isn't there, the interventions won't help. 

That last one is a lot to achieve and takes time. I don't expect client's to trust me right out the gate. I sure didn't trust my first or second therapist when we met (yes, even therapists need therapists). So when seeking therapy it might be worthwhile to find a therapist who specializes in something other than CBT and someone who you can take some time to feel comfortable with before actually diving into more personal history. A lot of this response has been speculation on my end, but I hope some of this information is useful to yourself and others.",TheNewVegasCourier,nv1d55
4,"I am a therapist in the UK. I am not trained in CBT.  The way I work is humanistic existential.  

Why don't you look up this type of therapy and see if this sits better with you?
 We work very differently and look at why and where your feelings are coming from and try to understand your patterns, your processes rather than block or change them. We also do a lot of work on acceptance of life and how it is for you. A lot of childhood trauma cannot be helped with CBT. It's like putting a sticky plaster on a broken leg.

Also if you are suffering with long term health issues I would suggest reading the following:

Examples would be EMDR or ACT...",printerparty,nv1d55
10,"Not sure of your situation but I understand what you mean about CBT. I think you might enjoy Frankl's book ""Man's Search for Meaning"".

From my limited understanding, CBT is kind of meant to be the way you describe. The idea is that your thoughts influence your emotions,  like how, regardless of your actual mood, when you smile with your muscles you get happier, or you stand with your hands on your hips you feel more confident. Therapy in this sense isn't so much about ""dealing"" with issues as it is about smiling through the pain with your mind. There is no 'big answer' coming with CBT, just a reframing of the current situation to better suit a positive mood. I think that CBT is very useful, but I really believe a sense of purpose (whether real or illusory) is required for lasting positive change.

15,"That's exactly why I think CBT was ineffective in my case. Reframing may be beneficial because thinking in absolutes is certainly not healthy. However, I think that our thoughts in a certain period of life are just the tip of an iceberg.

In my understanding, our thoughts are shaped by a myriad of factors, including our upbringing and personal history. I'm not a fan of CBT because it seems to largely ignore those things, focusing only on symptoms and not the cause. As the years go by we change, gain new experiences and have different problems. My mindset is subject to constant change and I didn't feel prepared for my future challenges when I attended CBT. 

I've finished psychodynamic therapy and it certainly helped me to solve some of my problems. For example, I've started to notice some patterns in my behavior that were definitely caused by my past. I've got to grieve the childhood I never had. Finally, I've learned to set boundaries and I've accepted that I can't control everything.

Therapists always seem like they're trying to help me ""logic"" myself out of my situation. 

My severe allergies, asthma, and eczema are being treated as well as they can be. There is nothing that can change my situation. Only how I react to it. Of course, how am I supposed to react to my ""situation"", when I don't even have the energy to play with my 4 year old?

Honestly, I stopped going to therapy because I wasn't getting what I thought I wanted or needed from it. My situation was no longer a matter of, ""survive until you can get older and move away from my toxic mother or evil classmates"".

I'm seeing a new CBT person after having seen one for years and her approach is very different. Not better or worse, just different, and it seems to work for me.

What happens is I have good moments where I know the health things I'm depressed about don't make me unloveable, or a failure, or mean that I can't live my life. But when I have flares those thoughts come in, i believe them, and i sit with them and let them affect my mood for days sometimes.

28,"CBT doesn't work well for me either. And I've noticed that a lot of folks who are big on CBT tend to blame the patient if there isn't change. But if the approach isn't working, it's the therapists job to adjust.

CBT makes me angry because it feels dismissive and the coping skills I'm given usually miss the mark and address ""problem behavior"" rather than the sources of my issues.

Ex: I've been told to snap a rubber band on my wrist, play video games, go to bed, etc if I want to self harm. But this doesn't work because it doesn't address the emotions that are leading me into wanting to self harm and all the things during the day that have fed that urge. And typically they also steamroll me or view me as ""resistant"" if I say I don't want to stop self harming rather than trying to understand ~why~ I don't want to stop. 

DBT helped more, but really what helps me most is having a therapist actually talk to me about my feelings and fully hear what I'm saying. I need someone to listen to me before they start telling me what to do lmao

That's just an example.

More than that though in my opinion, therapists who lean heavily on things like CBT and DBT have never been effective for me.

The Cognitive Behavioral Therapy program I went through was for depression/anxiety. I found that it was very hit and miss until I started to pick out bits and pieces of what was being taught that was actually helpful...heading off depressive spirals, mindfulness exercises, returning to some of the meditative practices I had when I was a teenager, etc.

A big thing to keep in mind with CBT is that how effective it is depends on you, not the therapy. You have to be in the right mindset. You have to be very cognizant of the way your mind functions.

I honestly wonder how many of these cases are actually cases of 2 or 3.  I know I heard ""you're not ready for change"" from therapists for years and years and years.  And looking back...a lot of it was kind of like enrolling someone who hasn't had basic algebra in a calculus class and then telling them they should come back later when they're ready for the class.  Or telling someone they're not ready to cross a bridge when the bridge isn't safe and needs to be repaired by whoever's actually responsible for that.  It's technically true, but it's not a particularly useful answer.  It's not something that leaves the client with an option of something they can actually do.

&#x200B;

I sometimes wonder if there's not enough distinction being drawn between ""the patient isn't ready for change"" and ""the patient isn't ready for this particular change or set of changes.""  I'm not sure how to fix that always - it seems like the more we're moving towards standardized options in therapy, the fewer options there are for people who don't fit within the standard boxes.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately I've also seen a lot of people saying that CBT can be iffy for dealing with disability and chronic health issues.  It's easy for CBT to slip into ableist ways of thinking that see accepting realistic limitations as negative or defeatist behavior.  I know from reading the research that dealing with societal discrimination and bias can be a weak point of standard CBT.  You really need a therapist that can tell the difference between helping a client overcome doubts and low self esteem, and pushing a client to do things that aren't possible or aren't safe for them, or pushing them to ignore or deny the realities of life around them.  That can be difficult if the therapist isn't familiar with working with people with disabilities.

Its one of those things however that you’re “not allowed” to hate. Much like sushi, if you say you hate it, you’ll have just about everyone at your throat with ifs and buts about it, invalidating your opinion. “You’re not using the right therapist” or “You’re the problem, not cbt” blah blah

55,"To this you and I agree here so I'll extrapolate a bit on what I mean by the first point.

The statement someone isn't ready for change, is purely a blanket statement without context. So yes context matters here. To your analogy, if someone gets enrolled into an advanced course witout the prereqs then they definitely might not be ready for the material they are learning. Which would make it harder, more stressful, and make the time and energy put into it feel pointless. But this is not the only situation one can find themselves in. They could not be ready for example because the environment they are in isn't conducive (substance abuse or domestic violence for example). In these cases the environment needs to change before the person can adequately make other changes so that's where their focus should be first. Or it could be a case of a person not believing they need to make any changes and are forced into therapy (think adolescents). This is by no means an exhaustive list of examples, but the idea here is my use of that statement isn't to say it some personal failing for the client to not be ready for change. Lots of things factor into it. The positive side of me says however, that still trying therapy and learning these things even if you aren't ready to commit to them, is still beneficial. How do we know we don't like a food until we try it? It's a learning experience (the common phrase being plant the seed even if you'll never see the tree grow). The cynical side of me says it's unfortunate that there are poorly trained, or outright unprofessional individuals in the field who may completely ruin the the therapy experience for someone. However, the truth is this is just the nature of the world. Drs, laywers, heck even servers at a restaurant! They can all represent a bad experience for us and make us not want to engage with the thing again (going to drs, going to a restaurant, being wary of paying for lawyers, etc). 

To your other point about a distinction of what change the client might not be ready for, I absolutely agree. There are also things that are outside the client's control that need to be taken into consideration (systemic, racial, gender issues etc). While I personally have never had to say to someone ""i don't think you're ready for therapy, come back later"" I've definitely had candid conversations with people about what therapy they need. Some need once a week, some once a month, some need more intensive services. So what I'll do is explore these options with them and try to keep them on track for accomplishing what they're trying to accomplish. That's just good collaboration. But at the end of the day, I'm just the passenger in the car. The client has the wheel, gas, and brake. So I'll give directions to go even though I can't actually move the car. That's what I think of when I talk about someone being ready, because everything I just talked about is a LOT of pressure for people. Especially if they're already under some other struggle at the time. Not everyone is ready for that level of freedom. So rather than pushing them to drive on the highway, I might say let's practice in the parking lot for a little while.

It’s ok if you don’t believe everything, CBT encourages you to do a lot is faking till you make it practicing awareness and training your  brains emotional reactivity to adhere to a new kind of cycle that you can actually manage or break out from

Being able to stop and step outside how your body is reacting to see that the stress and trauma lives there and how you can heal it to make your body and mind a safe place is a huge comfort. The feeling of not being “safe”- constantly feeling in a state of threat response to yourself and/or your past is so grueling

A trauma informed therapist is very important too- it seems like they’re not addressing this hugely crucial aspect if all the sessions are surface level shallow. 

Having someone who understands the memory of the nervous system and how to regulate it is most important in my opinion. CBT is long term practice to rewire your brain and how you perceive yourself and respond. Focusing on how the things that bother you most manifest in physical reactions when they cross your mind and addressing this bodily response can provide immediate relief and results.

In recent years, there has been very encouraging evidence for therapeutic breathing, which can be combined with cognitive therapy methods for dealing with worrisome thoughts.  
  
When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
  
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min in the early morning and at bedtime  is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
  
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
  
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
  
  
Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.  
  
A variety of  things are good for stress management, such as the lifestyle program developed by therapist/researcher Stephen Ilardi at his university, based on extensive study of how lifestyle affects our moods, and the 3-part mind-body awareness program of Brown and Gerbarg, who have published 6 papers on breathing and mental health.

5,"Yeah, that makes sense. If you're feeling super anxious (or really any emotion at 10/10 intensity) it's really hard to think calmly and rationally.

6,I have not that sounds like it could be very helpful tho,Professional_Toe2514,15ep5d3
7,"It can definitely be super helpful when used regularly! When we have big overwhelming emotions, especially feelings of fear or anxiety, our amygdala (fight/flight/freeze part of the brain) will override our prefrontal cortex (rational, logical part of the brain). So it's much much harder to ""be reasonable"" when we are overwhelmed/flooded. 

This is a physical state our body enters. So, it stands to reason that before anything else, we need a physical solution! If you Google ""progressive muscle relaxation"" (PMR), or ""breathing relaxation exercises"", you can find a lot of useful information about how to decrease physiological distress and help bring back function to your prefrontal cortex. Once you do this successfully, it's a lot easier to do those CBT exercises/skills.",fungi__cat,15ep5d3

However, CBT doesn’t work for everyone, and people diagnosed with BPD are one of those groups that sees less success with CBT. 

DBT was created for those with BPD but is now being used for people with different diagnoses and symptoms. 

DBT is super effective for BPD, There is research showing high success rate and remission of symptoms after even a year of treatment.

Reading the history of a treatment doesn't negate its value in other arenas. 1.6 percent of americans have BPD. Something like 60 percent of clinics nation wide offer DBT

""The available research suggests that DBT skills training is a critical component and mechanism of action in DBT and can be effective as a stand-alone or adjunctive intervention for a variety of conditions. The strongest evidence exists for brief DBT skills training as a stand-alone intervention for binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa. In addition, moderate evidence exists for the efficacy of brief DBT skills training as an adjunctive intervention to antidepressant medication for individuals with MDD, as well as a stand-alone intervention for ADHD. Two trials have shown promising results for DBT skills training for borderline personality disorder, but the findings require replication because of the notable differences between trials in treatment length, the use of adjunctive treatment components, and the severity of illness.""",RWPossum,18mxz8z

Anxiety is what CBT does best. However, different people have different results. Also, anxiety itself, as opposed to anxiety disorders, is part of life. We all have  anxiety to some degree.  
  
But people overcome anxiety disorders all the time, and CBT is very important in this.  
  
Most people with anxiety disorders do better with therapy (CBT) than with medicine, and some are successful with self-help based on CBT. I can show you some CBT self-help but first I want to say that recently there has been very impressive evidence for therapeutic breathing.    
   
  
  
When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.

When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
   
   
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
   
   
When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.  
   
   
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
   
   
The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.

If the doc wants to strong arm you into one path they probably arnt very good overall. Not saying they are but if you feel that id run away.

Good docs think of multiple ways to help someone. But lots out there have this one size fits all and apply that to all their patients.",BarryGrayson,pon99s
7,Thanks for your response! Yeah I’m not sure I feel very frustrated by it all and the fact my psychologist is suggesting I need to challenge my thinking but the thought of challenging my thoughts makes me angry and more anxious when I just get anxious or depressed randomly. so I think there’s a issue that causes the frequent unhealthy and changing thoughts that needs to be treated not the actual thoughts if that makes sense? But I am also not a professional so what makes me think I know better,babymonitor5,pon99s
8,"If you do do cbt its gonna be backwards feel like its backfiring but thats the path to learning it

 no one succeds right away. But honestly if you do one thing trust yourself(easier said than done). And be upfront about all these maybe gauge their response to if you tell them its not really working",BarryGrayson,pon99s

1,"I went to a group CBT session for a couple weeks that my GP made me go to, if I still have the booklets (I'll have to check tomorrow) I'm happy to send some pictures or scans of the pages to you! 

what I will say helped the most was this: realising that what you feel or are thinking is just a cue from something else. it's not necessarily fact. and then rewrite it. i mostly look at CBT from my depression point of view as my anxiety is kind of intertwined with that rather than a separate entity. so this example might not be perfectly relevant, it's just all I can think at almost midnight.

(for example, in the past, if my boyfriend didn't hear something I said cause he was distracted by some video game:  I might have gotten upset, thought he just doesn't give a shit about what I have to say, and then feel useless and unloved, less important than a stupid game. 
but then I reframe it: did he have a busy day today? maybe he's burnt out. maybe I spoke quieter than I thought and he genuinely didn't hear me. even if he was distracted, that doesn't mean I'm less important than a game, remember times where you've had to ask people to repeat themselves cause your brain was elsewhere? that didn't mean you hated them! 
and so on).

just walk yourself through the motions.

1,Maybe try another therapy. Just be honest with your therapist tell her/him what kind of therapy you’ve been doing and mention that it didn’t work. There is nothing wrong in trying many different type of therapy. It may be a long path but I am sure you’ll find the ideal one. You should of course have some potential and you should want to heal. Once you have these two things in your mind it would be much more easier. Try to remember your therapist’s words everyday or when you’re facing any situation that disturbs you.,Arty_Peace685,vwoeil

1,"Hey friend, what you mentioned regarding ""developing the skills to tolerate comments and situations in your daily life that are related to your physical appearance..."" it sounds like you may be leaning towards saying you want to learn how to communicate, establish and enforce certain boundaries with people around you.

CBT seems to be primarily focused on correcting inaccurate thoughts, so perhaps your therapist wanted you to focus more on the value you place on other peoples opinions of you?

An example goal for something like this would be, ""I would like to work towards placing more value on what I think of myself and less value on what others think of me"", or ""I would like to work towards changing the thoughts that lead me to behave in a way that is pleasing or acceptable to others.""

I realized my mom caused my episodes, I would talk to her and react badly or end up crying so much afterwards. I asked my doctor for CBT to help my relationship with my mom. I've been doing CBT for nearly 2 years. I have been advised to stay away from my mom in the mean time. My doctor told me to write a letter to my mom to let her know how I feel. She played the victim card. She said I'm sorry you feel that way but I won't apologize for the way I raised you. She didn't want to fix things or anything, instead she felt attacked. So the CBT helped me find coping mechanisms and helped me focus on my goals and myself while avoiding my family.",Agreeable_Sign_4540,x5o3zs

2,"I have just started my own NHS CBT therapy and am 2 sessions into it. I can say after these first two interactions I have had a positive experience. My therapist has been great at getting to understand me and my thought processes- what causes my anxiety and stress feelings to build up and cause me to go into a spiral of bad thoughts. She has always offered me great solutions to the problems I have faced. It can be confronting having to address your problems and anxieties so directly and I can’t lie that has not been easy for me so far but when you are able to action the methods shown to you, it really does show you how effective the CBT can be. You have to give into the process and commit yourself to it. 

I think like yourself I was consonantly trying to read about CBT before hand and read similar things. However, I think it’s best to try and go into this without any preconceptions other than the fact that your therapist has only one goal and that is to help you with whatever you are facing. I get that the video call aspect is also a little daunting and I also don’t have a great self confidence issues when it comes to pictures or videos of myself , I try to just stare directly at my therapist and not look at the little screen of myself in the corner. Alternatively you don’t really have to look at the screen you could maybe focus on a spot on your wall or somewhere in your room whilst you talk.

I think the hardest thing is putting yourself out there and seeking that help in the first place so you’ve already done the hard bit! One thing I learnt in my first session is “there’s no such thing as the word failure in our vocabulary”. If you try the therapy and it doesn’t work out after a few sessions it was not a failure. You have successfully tried to tackle your problem, but did not find the most suitable solution that works for you. I hope this puts your more at ease.

3,"thank you so much, you have no idea how comforting this is to read… knowing someone is going through pretty much the exact same thing and that their experience has been a positive one so far is really settling. thank you for taking the time to write everything you did, I promise it was totally worth it because you’re comforted a very nervous person haha! it’s definitely nice knowing what sorta things to expect.

I’m super glad that it’s going well for you so far, and strangely enough what you said about “putting myself out there” in the first place was exactly what the person said over the phone with me who asked me a bunch of questions to figure out what type of therapy treatment is right for me— so, hopefully that’s going to feel true! it was overwhelming making that phone call, but I want to keep looking at this with a positive outlook. my treatment date is on the 19th and I can’t stop thinking about it at all.

I’ll definitely try to do what you said regarding the video call aspect too— I know I’ll have a bit of a melt down if I see myself so I definitely will have to focus on the wall or something,, eye contact is a struggle but hopefully my therapist won’t mind! because we’re going through such similar experiences, I do wonder if there’s any chance we have the same therapist— what are the odds haha. 

may I ask how often your sessions are? I haven’t been told that yet so I’m assuming my therapist will let me know based on their schedule when my first appointment arrives, but I’d like to have some sort of an idea!

I feel like there was so much more that I wanted to say but I want to say thank you again the most, you’ve even really helpful. 💛",Either_Ad5967,wd5cvm
4,"Sorry for not replying sooner I have been away.  I’m glad my reply was helpful for you and helped ease some worries. You’ve done so well to reach this point and get the help you may need.

So you’re session is today and it will most definitely be confronting as you go through the referral sheet so your therapist will chat briefly about some of the things you have mentioned. Your goals and what you want to achieve in life and through therapy. But also the things you struggle with as well. I think at first the directness of the therapy took a little getting used to as it is very practical and I’m sure you’ll be asked to do things such as write down thoughts and feelings etc which I know for me personally took me out of my comfort zone as I have always bottled everything up.

My therapist has always said she wants to see me on a weekly basis and usually at the same time so that it becomes more of a routine. Of course this may differ for you. I’ve got my 4th session on Tuesday and I think after feeling benefits from my sessions I think you start to feel less anxiety about speaking of your issues and more relief to be getting support with them.

All I can say is good luck with it and try to put as much of yourself into it to get as much back. You will have to confront feelings that you’ve been pushing aside and that is always going to be hard, but just remember you’re with a professional and there is no judgement. I hope it goes well and if you want to message again feel free to do so :)",dales94,wd5cvm

1,"It was my first time trying out CBT as well and I felt reallyyy nervous too. Don’t be too hard on yourself, it’s completely fine to feel nervous or maybe even a little sceptical.

I can tell you about my experiences with CBT if you want me to. In the first few sessions we just got to know each other, why I decided to seek professional help, questions about my social life, questions about important events in my life and so on. Sometimes she’d give me “homework” to do until my next session such as “meet up with person X” to work on my social anxiety and feeling of loneliness. You’re not _forced_ to do anything but it definitely helps with your therapy progress. At least it helped with mine a lot.

Now I’ve been going to therapy for about 7 months and it improved my mental health _A LOT_ which I’m very proud of. Sometimes it’s definitely hard work in therapy because some sessions are harder than others (you talk a lot about your thoughts and feelings) but all in all I would say that I benefitted a lot from therapy and I’m glad I sought help.

I hope this helped you a little. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask me!",,l5idcy
2,"Hello. I am a therapist and deliver CBT all the time. Trust me, the therapist will want to help you. It's part altruism (no one becomes a therapist to get rich, or if they do they were very uninformed) and its also because it's a challenge and that's why the job is enjoyable, and its also because of their own self-esteem. Therapists want to make people  better, and they feel better about themselves when their patients get better, because it validates them as a therapist (which will be a big part of their life - its a vocation after all). When you meet them, remember that they want to help you, they will want to use their expertise, but they will want you to be the expert in your problem. They cant experience what you experience so they will need you to describe what you are going through in detail, and it might feel a bit egotistical but it will be appreciated by them. It's tough when someone sits in front of you and gives you one word answers, or tries to tell you what they think you want to hear, rather than just being totally honest and spilling their guts.

1,Gas lighting? What do you mean? Do you do it with a phycologist/ therapist or something? How do you do it?,,qgrqav
2,"Hi, I just saw you post and I relate to you. CBT felt right first but when needed it failed me. I found it hard to apply. My therapists recommending a small workbook on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) after the CBT sessions and I really want you to know about it. 

Since starting that by myself it feels like I've actually made steps and finally started improving. ACT is also a form of cognitive behavioral therapy but instead of focusing on ""faults"" and then sollutions like you're a horse to be whipped, it focuses on workability and accessibility. Welcoming any thought and teaching healthy ways of handling them in the proces of your life. Please give it a look, it did me a lot of good after a CBT group.

CBT says thoughts can be faulty right, it gives you ways to spot them and a some sollutions. But that sort of implies you're a problem to be fixed... And those sollutions aren't as easy for everyone to just ""do"".

The ACT approach is acceptance of whats going on inside, no matter what it is. It doesn't ""use the mind on the mind"" so much or say you're faulty. Instead it teaches ways to accept thoughts instead of struggle with them, they're there and once gone something else will take the stage! (wether helpful or not lol, it's like a bloody race car) And it teaches ways to ""unhook"" from unhelpful thoughts, or any really. When your mind takes you for a wild ride, you gently step off the ride. After that come ways to get out of your head, and connect with your deepest values and to commit action to those (instead of daily anxiety or impulses, in my case).

I went on to read a book by the main founder and it speaks of helping people with OCD in helpful lasting ways, with help from a therapist ofcourse! Maybe you can mention this? Or ask about it? There are 2 great TED talks by him if you want to get a better idea of it.",pietplutonium,qgrqav
3,"I'm on my second round of CBT with Therapy for you through the NHS, I had to cancel the first one because the therapist made some awful remarks about my alcoholic mother and it was just overall a bad experience. I went private and had many sessions with a CBT trained therapist who was really nice but the whole CBT approach was so so overwhelming. It was all solutions based to my thoughts and behaviour which just really didn't work for me, I also found that quite often to be a bit gas-lighting as I felt like I was being made to over empathise with people who have been horrible/nasty to me/caused trauma. I'm currently trying CBT with Therapy for you again specifically for depression and OCD, but I'm being made to fill out questionnaires every week and fill out goal sheets and activity sheets so I can start 'doing more things in my day that I enjoy' and he wants to try and address the thoughts that affect my behaviours (which I totally understand the concept of) but it really feels like the wrong approach when I'm completely undiagnosed and suffer with far more than only anxiety and depression. I don't think my currently Therapist understands that I have a lot of mental blocks, major procrastination, dysregulated emotions and executive dysfunction (I'm seeking an assessment for ADHD to see if these things are related to that) and that these approaches don't seem useful to me. We've also spent three weeks of him explaining that we will be trying to figure out my thoughts behind my behaviours without actually starting any therapy, and next week were going to be going over the work sheet I am to fill out which still feels like its delaying any kind of actual therapy.

I've been trying to give it a chance but after a session I had yesterday, I had a huge depressive episode that lasted the rest of the day because it just felt like a continuation of a lack of understanding of my mental health with no real active recovery support.

I read a post yesterday talking about how CBT potentially doesn't work for people with Autism and was just wondering if thats the case for other things too and maybe it just doesn't suit some people?",DustyLemonTree,qgrqav
4,I wouldn’t put it to autism. Diagnosis’s can be tricky. Solution based to your thought is a good think too. Try doing it yourself if you like worked for me. It may be hard but writing down your thoughts and actions by yourself and the positive and negative results of them . It can help and i know what its like to have the mental blockages but just go slow if it feels like your confusing yourself and getting to worked up take a break and come back to it later. There might be a complication to how they come off ( gas lighting ) but they are there to help and i trust they have the right intention. Maybe after you write down a bit with paper and pen you can. Have compassion for yourself and do some positive self talk. Little bits at a time,,qgrqav
5,"I appreciate your support and advice. I have tried journalling, writing thoughts, positive self talk, everything really. I find it patronising to myself and it leaves me feeling worse off (for reason I don't understand). I really struggle with emotional regulation and a lot of the time if my brain doesn't want to co-operate, I have learnt that I just can't force it without consequences. 

I think my mental health is a lot more complex than I originally thought and CBT for me comes across very general. I know intentions are meant well but sometimes I found it too difficult to empathise and put my self in the shoes of the person who caused me trauma to see how they felt.

I also have difficulty identifying all of the emotions I feel and writing unfortunately feels too slow to express anything. I do have trouble with trying little bits at a time because I'm very much an all or nothing person which is something I will somehow have to learn. Thank you.",DustyLemonTree,qgrqav
6,"Don’t try force it go with the emotion. Allow yourself to feel it. You do have a choice to not attach to intrusive thoughts and when your brain isnt cooperating and your aware of it just say “thank you brain” for whatever the reason and try again when the time is right. I am an all or nothing thinker to but its taking me time to figure out that you cant just fix it all in one go its like a wound it needs time to heal, be sanitary and not going ahhh fuck and taking it out on yourself. Always look on the positive",,qgrqav

4. Antidepressants (Sertraline).

In terms of other medicines that help... Honestly, the one I still use daily and swear by is CBD oil. It relaxes you, calms anxiety, boosts my confidence and mood with the added benefit of even sometimes relieving headaches! But remember everyone's experience is individual.

0,"I’m general, CBT tends to be more present-focused so you may develop some skills for maintaining attention and memory day to day, but the treatment may not necessarily focus on delving into previous memories. If you experienced some traumatic events in your past, the form of CBT could involve creating a narrative of those events which can bring back memories. In that case usually there is a specific event or events you’re addressing to reduce distress. 

If you’re interested in developing more of a narrative of your past, you could look for a provider who specializes in that or who takes a more psychodynamic approach. That focuses more on past experiences and relationships to develop a better understanding of what is going on now.",kbucrock,fa22r0

I've only been using it for maybe 2 weeks but I have seen it calm my anxiety a lot!",zhuleedothething,xnpnrb
2,"I know I'm a few months late here... but I currently use BetterHelp and Bloom. I will be ending my therapy sessions on BetterHelp soon due to the fact that they don't accept insurance and it's getting too expensive to continue out of pocket. So I found Bloom to start using between sessions and it's been fantastic! I personally find that CBT method works best for me in therapy so I think that plays a role in why I love the app so much. You have the option of choosing your guide in all sessions - one is more empathetic and gentler with his approach, while the other is more direct and straight to the point with her approach. I love that because everyone has their preferences. They have so many programs on the app and a library full of meditations and sessions with specific categories (friends, relationships, depression, work, stress, etc.). I bought the app for $40 for the year after my free trial and I find it's worth every penny. The guides cover a lot of the topics I did in therapy so it's not too far off. It even gives you a journaling option to track your moods. I don't think it replaces therapy necessarily, but it definitely provides a lot of the same tools and resources to help you. Sometimes that's enough for people though and they find they don't need further counseling.",1000darkshadesofblue,xnpnrb
0,"Get ready for a rant my friend... 

In my opinion, insurance companies, medical doctors, and whomever else gets to make our health care decisions, prefer CBT because it makes you *look* like you're getting better so they can say ""problem over"" and wipe their hands of you. I think pushing CBT as the #1 cure-all for mental illness does far, far more harm than good. 

It's a ""fake it till you make it"" approach that only helps if the problem exclusively has to do with your mindset. If *anything* you can't control in your environment is affecting your mental health, you can fake it all day, all year, all life, and you're never going to make it, no matter how hard you try. It makes things worse because it teaches an already unwell person to think that it's their fault; if only they could try better, or if only they could turn their point of view around, if only they could be good at CBT or work harder, or some shit like that. 

I tried 5 CBT therapists, who just made things so much worse, before I gave up. Two of them blew off what I was telling them since it didn't fit their preferred patient profile. Two others told me I was making it up. And yet another was just someone who tried to force-fit me into her specialized treatment plan. I gave up and said that therapy wasn't for me. 

A year later, I hit an even lower point, couldn't function, went to my doctor for new meds and ended up having a meltdown in the exam room. She suggested I try someone new, and I did because I was so low I was willing to try anything again. Guess what? This wasn't a CBT therapist. Until she explained it to me, I didn't know that there's different kinds of therapy other than CBT. I had no effing clue. I thought therapy was therapy. I chose to try psychotherapy and I've stuck with it for over 3 years now... and it's helping, a lot. 

There are so many more kinds of therapy than the insurance money-grubbing bastards want you to know, so I highly suggest trying a different type. Insurance will fight you, family will fight you, friends will think you're weird, but damn if it doesn't actually help with the real problem instead of playing make-believe. 

So after all that ranting, I never actually listed out the types of therapy:

* Psychotherapy
* Interpersonal therapy
* CBT - entirely crap in 95% of cases, IMO
* Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) - I have no idea what this is, but I don't like it because it sounds like CBT
* Group therapy - helps some people, I can't find one that's not an AA-BS meeting

and I'm sure there are a bunch that I don't know about.

I've got a lovely mix of dysthymia, major depression, anxiety, and CPTSD. I highly recommend that you see if you can find someone in your area that will do psychotherapy for you. You might be able to talk your doctor into stating that it's medically necessary because of how many other types you've tried. ",dogsmakebestpeeps,57iij2
1,"I've had two run ins with attempted CBT for agoraphobia, 

the first they told me the appointments were a couple towns over ""well I'm agoraphobic, how am I meant to get there?"" Their response was more or less ""well if you want to get better you'll get to your appointments"", if I could do that then I wouldn't need help now would I?

The second time the guy gave me a task, to ""just"" walk to the corner shop, if I couldn't do it then I obviously didn't want help because I wasn't willing to make the effort.

7,"I'm sorry that you had to deal with such an unhelpful and unsympathetic response. The fact that any psychological professional should accuse you of not wanting to do anything to help yourself is nothing short of despicable to me.

I haven't suffered from agoraphobia myself, but I can easily see that it must be a terrifying experience. It seems as though your mental health worker didn't take your fears seriously at all. How on earth do they sleep at night when they provide such useless advice as that? It seems to me that they are saying, ""Just get over it!"" without giving you the tools to do so.

Are your problems still ongoing, or were you able to find another, more helpful therapist or locate any useful self-help techniques for yourself?

Stories like yours make me really angry at the professionals who have undergone all the training and still let down the patients entrusted to their care. As one of the patients in my care facility said, ""You only have to look at the top-of-the-range cars the psychiatric staff drive to see where their motivation lies.""

If not, please don’t worry, but is there any chance you could tell me why you think it doesn’t work? I’m curious if it would match what I think and/or help me explain to my cbt therapist why I think this is never going to work. 

This is my 3rd round of cbt in the span of a decade, and it still isn’t helping, but it’s all they will give me and I can’t afford a private one who will do whatever style helps instead. The NHS is a pain for mental health. I’m either left to it, or when I break down and beg for help it’s yet another round of cbt. It’s so pointless.

16,"Happy to help. You touched on a subject near to my heart (and brain). CBT assumes that the problem is with your thinking; that your thoughts and assumptions are incorrect and therefore inappropriate feelings and poor actions result from your thoughts. What about if your thoughts and assumptions ARE correct? That you really are in an abusive relationship, or your boss really is a bastard, or that someone who claims to be your friend is an undercover bitch? CBT doesn't give you any tools to deal with these situations, it prefers you to challenge your own perception on each occasion. I even mentioned this to my Counsellor, and she said, (in frustration) ""Well, it is a bit of kid-ology!"" Meaning you have to ""kid"" or fool yourself to get it to work. I've always been someone who wants the truth, as uncomfortable as it might be, instead of a pretty lie.

I notice that I was far more concerned about keeping this to myself 5 years ago. I suppose these days I believe that people can hear my truthful opinion and decide for themselves.",scifiwoman,57iij2
17,"Warning, this is long! Sorry! :)

Hey, thank you for getting back to me! Yeah that’s how I feel too. I won’t bore you with the details, but part of my anxiety comes from a medical condition I have, which has no cure, and the worry that symptoms will flare up and I will get very ill in public etc etc. But CBT feels so dismissive like the therapist is saying “ah but it’s all in your head, that won’t happen! :)!”  Umm, yeah it could, it has and whilst it hasn’t got to the level I am afraid of, it has gotten pretty darn close. 

It’s not epilepsy, but imagine if someone was afraid of having a seizure in public, and the therapist is just like “PoSiTiVe ThInKiNg!!!”  Does my head in! 

Plus my current therapist is like baffled because she can’t figure me out because I am a positive thinker naturally, I never have anything for my diary because any negative thoughts that crop up I always tend to by putting things into perspective, like “yeah this sucks, but imagine feeling this way and living in a war torn country where my house could get blown up. I’m actually pretty lucky!” 

She is a nice person, but I just don’t fit their patient expectations, they expect you to be a negative nelly and all doom and gloom constantly. When the case is that you have been through a ton of trauma for years, are *still* able to feel happy, but just really need help with fixing your agoraphobia that was caused by it all, (which is the one thing you can’t fix alone, despite trying for a decade) they act like that meme of that guy with the smile and the question marks around him. They just have no clue what to do with me. 

I’m such a happy person despite all my mental diagnosis’s that they assume I’m lying or in deep denial because there is no fathomable way to them that I can be a positive thinker who deals with “hot thoughts” who STILL hasn’t recovered. I explained I’m almost Buddhist (as in I am but not officially or anything, and a lot of that is about letting go and how meditation helps) but nope, I must be in *such* deep denial about it all. 

It’s to the point I had to make up some crap on the diary just so I wouldn’t get moaned at for not having any bad thoughts again. That means the therapy experience isn’t honest, I’m not being treated for what is actually wrong. 

My biggest issue is my body gets physically and violently ill with hardly any warning, and that is not in my head, so the thoughts are irrelevant. Then if I get some bad thoughts like “oh no what if X happens?” The reason I get them are that it sadly is a very likely possibility. 

I felt like CBT would work great with stuff like, “I want to go for the promotion but I’m terrified of public speaking and the new role requires that, help!” Sure, CBT would probably do wonders. For the heavy stuff though, the stuff that can’t be changed, fears that are very true and grounded in reality, how could it ever help? I mean if there is a kid in Syria right now terrified his house is gonna get bombed, it wouldn’t matter how positive and well adjusted he is, it’s still a non-zero chance and a threat that his house could get hit with a missile leaving his family homeless or dead. 

Haha sorry for be long rant, I just hate this CBT stuff because when I have quit in the past they are like you aren’t better cause you gave up! It’s exhausting. Nice to find someone who feels the same about it all. 

Thank you for your time! :)",Written_Wishes,57iij2
18,"No problem at all, I hope that my answer can help you in any way, even if it's just to confirm that you're not alone in finding CBT unhelpful. Your Agoraphobia sounds like a terrible thing to deal with and I am so sorry that your therapist isn't providing you with any solutions to actually remedy your condition. It is awful that your opinion and experiences are being hand waved away like that. It must be awfully frustrating for you and you have my sincere sympathy for what you are suffering. 

Idk what I can suggest to you, other than maybe going back to your GP and requesting a different therapist who utilises a different approach. You might have to be assertive and stand your ground, ""the squeaky wheel gets the oil"" as the saying goes. Your condition is real and impacts your life severely, every single day. You need and deserve treatment that will actually address your Agoraphobia, not a useless therapist who isn't taking it seriously, when it is a serious issue in your life which prevents you from enjoying your life to the full 

Again, all I can say is that I am very sorry for the dreadful way you have been treated and offer you my heartfelt sympathy. 

Please try to enjoy the New Year 2022 celebrations as much as you can. I hope that next year will bring you better luck in getting heard by a mental health professional who will actually address and treat your condition. I hope that you will find a way forward so that you can get more enjoyment out of your life - you deserve it!

1,"To add on why I don't think cbt is for me, my supporter keeps saying about treating anxiety and  sleeping issues without ever wanting to talk about where those issues come from despite me repeatedly bringing it up. I don't feel like I have anxiety, I feel like I have ptsd

Back ground info:

I grew up in a house with drug addicts where violence was the normal. Beatings, stabbings, people being pushed down stairs. One time one of them slit their wrists on my bed while I (14 at the time) pretended to be asleep, they then wiped their blood down the walls and left only for me to have to clean it up in the morning. I've had bottles thrown at my head, accidentally ingesting cocaine several times trying to make food and more that I just can't even think of right now. 

Police were constantly at the house. One time one of them said ""weren't we here this week once?"" I replied,  you've been here twice this week and she's been here 3 times.

Then my parents got me arrested for coming in at 6am (18 here) because I went out to drink and they didn't like my partner, ended up sleeping rough for a bit. Moved in with that partner who was domestically violent to me a lot,  we lost a child, turns out they were a drug addict too and since then (26 now) everything just feels fucked, like there's nothing to look forward to.

I'm also being assessed for autism at the moment

0,"I agree with this logic. Many psychological precepts are rooted in the (false) assumption that people operate on a level playing field and they're not actively trying to game the system through manipulation. It's impossible to use CBT to suss out gaslighting and narcissistic abuse.

That said, CBT is merely one tool. It's not intended to be relied upon for every application. A hammer is one tool. You're not going to saw a board or  unscrew a flathead with a hammer. While your post is very detailed and correct in its conclusion, the inference that CBT is the only thought tool we might use to heal is as short-sighted as thinking hammers are the only hand tools we might use to build.",,g8sop2
1,"I think this is a common and fair critique of CBT, it can feel dismissive and simplifies the human experience. A good therapist would find out if a client is even appropriate for CBT or use an eclectic approach since the basis of CBT is that irrational thought patterns negatively affect our feelings/behaviors, contributing to depression/anxiety. There would also be exploration of one’s core belief systems that stem from childhood that would impact these negative thinking patterns. CBT is not for everyone but it has its place in therapy.",xshirey,g8sop2
2,"I'm not really concerned about it being the only tool to heal.  I'm concerned about it being a tool that we're often given with no guidance on how to not hurt ourselves with it - or even any acknowledgement that getting hurt is a possibility.  I'm especially concerned about situations like this where you create an environment where the actual problem is getting worse, but the therapist believes they're helping and is leading the client to believe they're being helped.

On the level playing field comment, I could mention that I've also seen CBT do something similar with undiagnosed ADHD without anyone actively trying to game the system.  You get something like where occasional periods of hyperfocus are used as evidence that beliefs in a general problem are distorted thinking.  There's no intentional gaming involved, just a therapy method that deals poorly with the reality.

That's the question.  Sure, maybe CBT is a poor tool for what was actually going on.  But it's the tool that very often gets used and that very often people are told will help them, and it's a tool that can often function to actively block off the evidence that it's not actually helping.  That's what I'm questioning - why are we being regularly handed and told to use a tool that can get us hurt, but then not given any safety instructions and led to believe we're not being hurt after all?  And why won't the professionals explain how they're checking to see that we're actually being helped and not hurt?",WarKittyKat,g8sop2
3,"I think a lot of my question is how we're sussing out such things.  My concern in the above is not just the initial misdiagnosis and inappropriate approach, but how the CBT process can actually operate to ensure the *therapist* doesn't encounter information that would lead them to adjust their approach.  The whole process seemed to have a sort of self-reinforcing effect where it could both be actually causing a lot of damage to the client and at the same time giving evidence of progress to the therapist, and there really didn't seem to be much consideration of that.

I'm ok with it having its place in therapy, but I really want a better answer to how we judge if a situation is appropriate for CBT or not than ""common sense"" or similar.  Because right now the process often in practice seems to be to go ahead unless there's an obvious contraindication, and then CBT makes it even harder to find out non obvious ones.  And clients aren't given any guidance at all on when to and when to not use CBT techniques that they learned from therapy on their own.",WarKittyKat,g8sop2
4,"Again these are tools or modes, if you will. CBT is a popular mode of therapy. Cars are a popular mode of transportation. But you can't drive a car everywhere you might need to go. Asking these questions about CBT is like asking why car dealers don't discuss highway fatalities and why they aren't offering you a boat instead? There is script that a therapist follows, like anyone performing a repetitive task. The job is to teach the skills and so that is what they do. Personality, I think CBT is on the lowest rung of therapy that's available to people. 

Each mode has its adherents. CBT people do CBT pretty much exclusively in my experience. Your not going to get psychodynamic therapy from a therapist who's focus is CBT. And you're not going to buy a jet ski at a car dealership Some of these questions are venturing into why can't I get a jet ski territory. I agree with you in principle. These questions about therapy are valid but at a certain point the client has to start questioning too. What's underlying all these questions about CBT  is the fact that people don't educate themselves about different modalities that are available in therapy. People don't assess their own situation and make educated choivces. They usually take a path of least resistance. 

Yeah, it would be nice if the therapist was more circumspect. They often aren't. It's not the therapist's fault that clients fail to educate themselves about what else is out there besides CBT. If you're being regularly handed CBT as a solution then you're not shopping around for more appropriate therapeutic modalities. There are a ton of schools but that takes work and that takes research.",,g8sop2
5,"A major underlying issue here is that an abuse victim is extremely likely - as was the case for me - to enter therapy unaware that they're being abused.  Someone like me is entering therapy uncertain, knowing that something is obviously wrong but unsure about what.  If I had the ability to recognize the problem and shop around like that at the time, then quite frankly I wouldn't have had much reason to go to therapy in the first place.

The complaint I'm having is that the CBT techniques work *specifically* to convince people like me that we are being helped by CBT when we're not and to mislead them about what they need.  Not just that it's not working.  (I also remember them being used to reframe any sort of thinking that maybe therapy wasn't working as also stemming from my anxiety, and being told what I was experiencing was the normal temporary difficulties of changing thinking patterns.)

So yes, it absolutely IS the therapist's fault if they're handing someone in therapy CBT when CBT is actively convincing them that the underlying issue is other than what it is and that they shouldn't get help for the real issue.  And that's what's happening here; not just that CBT isn't working but that the client is being told it is working and shown, using CBT, that the issue they really need help with doesn't exist at all.  I was diagnosed with GAD and getting what, according to my research, was the best treatment for GAD.  Trouble is I actually needed treatment for C-PTSD, but I wasn't diagnosed with that and the therapy techniques were incorrectly reframing any memories that might lead me to realize that as symptoms of my anxiety.

So yes, I did do my research.  The trouble is my research wasn't good enough to overcome an entire system built in a way that continually reinforced a misdiagnosis.  With things like abuse, or with things like ADHD as I mentioned in my previous comment, that sort of modality research isn't really helpful unless the client already has a good idea of what their problem is - and that simply isn't a realistic expectation for many people.",WarKittyKat,g8sop2

0,"I hated CBT. It was patronising and pointless. I already know how to control my thoughts and emotions. I don't need training for that. I need to experience positive emotions once in a while instead of only negative ones. No amount of CBT has ever helped me with that, and neither have any of the antidepressants I've been prescribed. I've always just run away from my problems and buried them deep inside instead. That is *not* a good solution btw, I'm just saying it's the only one that has actually worked for me, personally.",cucumbulous,9gnfg6

3,Ok. Gotcha. I guess it could work for that.  My trauma was over a period of time and done by the person I was closest with.  It definately got my brain stuck in the fight or flight mode.

7,Did nothing for my trauma.  Yeah it all sounds fine and makes sense in the office talking about it but as soon as I left it all went out the window.

0,Have you spoken to your therapist about this?,Ryaubee,4dj630
1,"I agree with previous poster - speak with your therapist. CBT is not about proving you are ""right,"" or ""crazy."" It's about how your thoughts are affecting your mood. ""All or nothing"" or ""black and white"" thinking will result in more extreme emotions (SUDS: 1-10 scale). It's not that you won't feel the emotion still, it's that perhaps it will be less extreme, or more balanced with the presence of other thoughts. 

On another note, if you are feeling uncomfortable or more agitated by the treatment modality, it may be because you are actually challenging yourself to do something difficult. Good for you! You're seriously contemplating this thing. Remind yourself: self esteem is a product of mastery over increasing levels of obstacles and discomfort. 

EDIT: There is actually a skill (I think it's DBT) called ""fake it till you make it."" The idea is, you don't have to actually buy into something to try it... and sometimes it works. ",lvl20dm,4dj630
2,"You are concrentrating too much on the negatives of being fat 'People often treated me with contempt because of my weight'. Think of people who have been nice to you too, are you sure is that often make notes and find out.

3,My therapist thinks I'm not suited for CBT. I had insisted on trying it.,AlvySinger123,4dj630
4,"My therapist thinks I'm not suited for CBT. I had insisted on trying it. CBT makes me more aware of the hopelessness of my situation. If I am challenging myself to play an instrument, and I get frustrated and want to give up, I may tell myself I'll never get better, I have no talent, etc. It is easy to see how that is irrational and to reframe my thinking around it. But if I'm dealing with my reality, with forces beyond my control, there's no way to reframe it. To use an extreme example, take the elephant man. He's screwed. He's a freak and he may not be a bad person but he still horrifies people and they scream when they see him. How could he possible reframe any of that?",AlvySinger123,4dj630
5,"Sure, there are people who have treated me nicely, but not enough to where I feel any community. People are nice to me to the extent that they are either being polite or they want something.

All my life I've been marginalized because of my weight. And it's not just me, I've always socialized with people with unacceptable physical flaws. The fact is, studies have shown that life metrics across the board tend to be directly related to physical appearance - wealth, confidence, sexual experience, intelligence, happiness, health. Sure there are exceptions, but these are exceptional people.

7,"Ok, I've gone through this before too, CBT therapy sometimes felt from my experience somewhat patronising.

Like, trying to force too see the world in these rosy coloured glasses, and everything is so colourful, happy and wonderful, when your world view at every turn tells you otherwise. But the real truth is neither one side of the scale or the other, it's somewhere in between, even if the odds are stacked against you.

What I am trying to get at is, I don't really need to prove you're wrong about it, because you are quite right, however, it's still a one sided view. You seem to convince yourself with your studies, but I find them it hard to believe from my experience unattractive/poor etc. people can't feel content about who they are and have friendships. Why the hell not? I see lots of them around. Focus on your good qualities. Just pondering on things you find impossible or too hard to change, rule your life.

I feel that I am just programmed this way, and the best I can do is accept it, but it's such a sad and miserable thing to accept.
",AlvySinger123,4dj630
0,"CBT isn't painful. It's just writing out your thoughts and fears and correcting the logical fallacies so that you stop telling yourself things that aren't true. If you spend an hour a day doing the ""homework"" then it works pretty well. It can change your life. 

Won't totally cure your social anxiety, though it should help. Social anxiety can only really be cured by social activity. In other words, practice socializing. CBT will help you stop being as afraid of doing that though. 

Everyone should do CBT. It's the emotional equivalent of eating healthy. But for social anxiety specifically, exposure therapy is the best thing. Fortunately, that is pretty easy to do. Ask your therapist about it. You can do it on your own without a therapist but you probably need someone with you like a friend or family member to give you a push here and there and keep your fears from spiraling. And you'd have to know what to do. But it's basically this: First you just go out in public. Once you can successfully do that, you start going out in public and making eye contact with people and holding it for a moment. Once you can do that, you start making eye contact and saying ""hi"" to people you pass and keep walking. Then you amp it up to asking random people if they know where an ATM is, and say thanks when they tell you. Then you crank it up to asking if they know of a good place to eat around there.... and so on, until you've worked your way up to the hardest things of all like approaching attractive strangers and trying to get a date or something. 

Another similar solution is to get a job in customer service. It forces you to talk to people all day and so it has a similar effect and you stop being anxious just because you're used to interacting. However if you do that, you may feel like you're in over your head at first and it could backfire and you're afraid to go to work. So that's a risk. But it's a pretty effective way of getting over social anxiety and you get paid for it, if you think you're up for it. 

CBT + exposure therapy can turn you into a social butterfly. You'd probably laugh at that idea right now but it's true. There was a time I couldn't handle going into a store and buying something because I'd have to interact with a cashier. Now I can walk up to a stranger in public and initiate contact and turn them into a friend if I want to. It's like learning a superpower. 

Sorry to go so far off track but I've had a lifetime of experience dealing with social anxiety and it's one of the few things I actually had a lot of success fixing. CBT is great. If you actually do the stuff you're supposed to (writing in a journal), it will really help stop all the negative stuff going through your mind and help you feel a lot better about yourself and life and other people. With social anxiety, it will help ease the fear end of it. But you still need the other part, where you actually go have social interactions in order to really get over it. CBT just kind of helps you see that your assumptions are wrong - like when you go in public and feel like everyone thinks you are a creep, that's not true. Or at least you have no way of knowing that it's true. You're just assuming the worst case scenario.",Loose_with_the_truth,ha8a45

1,"Is your therapist assigning you “homework?” Sometimes it can be difficult to grasp things in session because a lot of examples may be from the past or hypothetical. Homework is useful because it allows you to track and challenge your worries/thoughts in real time, or close to real time. CBT takes a lot of work outside of session. 

Overall, I would talk directly with your therapist about what’s going well and not so well. Then you can troubleshoot together. You’re right, therapy isn’t cheap and if you don’t think it’s going well you and your therapist can work together to recalibrate.",kbucrock,dfyop5

0,"You may have misinterpreted CBT. The whole point is to change your thoughts by asking why questions and coming to the root of your beliefs, then challenging if the foundation is accurate. If it is accurate you ask if there is a more balanced way of looking at it, like if it is willing to accept nuances and conditions to the belief instead of being rigid. With gaslighting I believe your beliefs change because information is withheld from you, but CBT ALL the information is presented to you and your asked if you are able to look at the same situation in a different way.

For example, you know in TV shows when someone says “it’s not what it looks like” well that’s how people live their lives to some degree, they make assumptions when they don’t know they whole story. Generally speaking, people who have mental disorders aren’t dumb, their conclusions are pretty accurate, if you have low self esteem because your mom beat you that’s a logical consequence. However you are probably unaware that you did not make your mom beat you, or that beating in said context was not appropriate or that even if your mom thought it was okay to beat you it doesn’t mean it was okay even if she was convinced it was.
You are presented all the information that you may have overlooked and asked to consider another perspective then see if that new perspective is as or more logical than your original assumption.

It’s a very logical process not like gaslighting at all",Authentic2017,ha87mp
1,"I'm not sure if I understood correctly what you mean, and by no means am I an expert. But the way I've understood CBT, it's more about taking the situations we have, and the actions of other people, and accepting we cannot change those things, and accepting that all we can do is change the way we see those things and how we deal with them. So it's not that your feelings and thoughts are not valid, it's more that they are not helpful to you, and by learning to change the way you relate to things you can actually make yourself happier and more content. Does that make sense to you? I'm not sure if this answers your question at all, and I might be wrong, but this is how I've understood it.",thereborndodo,ha87mp
2,"Oh my goodness, I've always felt pretty much the same way about it. And it may not actually be the case, but I think what helps is being able to decide that it's a perfectly valid treatment and it's just not suited for us but that there are other treatments out there that might be.",AegilnoprstV,ha87mp
3,"Right, but the problem in CBT is that you're \*not\* being presented all the information, from what I've found.  You're being presented all the information you can come up with, at the time, or all the information the therapist thinks is relevant, or something.  And in my experience what actually happened was I was starting to explore the idea that something might have actually been wrong, and then therapy was encouraging me to challenge those beliefs by things like presenting the times my mother was nice to me as information to consider.

&#x200B;

I think there's darker aspects too.  One major issue is that our society simply doesn't account for the possibility of women being sexually abusive towards children.  So I might try to come to terms with what happened.  But we'd be pitting my \*feeling\* of being violated against my mother's statement that it was just medical care, and the fact that she did a lot of other things that were caring like bought me nice clothes and such.  And then applying the CBT methods it would come to the conclusion that my feeling was the problem.",WarKittyKat,ha87mp
4,"But what if our thoughts \*are\* helpful to us though?  The trouble is that both the gaslighting and my experiences with CBT were trying to change my thoughts in a way that would take responsibility for trying to change my apparent overreaction to a loving parent in order to restore the relationship.  When actually the apparently ""unhelpful"" thoughts were the ones that were telling me that I needed to gtfo and try to protect myself.  What thoughts are helpful is going to depend on what reality actually is.  And CBT didn't seem to have much of any checks for that.

&#x200B;

In that sense, ""not helpful"" isn't meaningfully distinct from ""not valid"".",WarKittyKat,ha87mp
5,"My problem is a treatment that, for people like me, actively convinces us that we're at fault for being abused is NOT a perfectly valid treatment.

It's one thing for a treatment to not be helpful for certain people.  The problem is that for me, my experience was that it was actively harmful.  And I think when we're dealing with a treatment that can actually do damage to people then we need something more than just ""not for us"".  Because it shouldn't be right that I'd have to go through a bunch of being convinced by therapy that I was at fault for the abuse and it was only my mental illness that made me want to get away in order to figure out that it wasn't suited for me.",WarKittyKat,ha87mp
6,"Lol, you know nothing nice your mom has done excuses sexual abuse right? If I loved and catered to my gf for years then raped her, I’m still going to jail.

That being said, you’re saying cbt doesn’t show all the info of a situation, but rather all the info you experienced or that you remember. The fact that you even said that means you believe that the evidence you remember is not enough to come to a conclusion about the event you experienced. That being said doesn’t that right there tell you that your existing perception of that event is flawed in and of itself? Because that is, as well, based off your memory of the event too. So either cbt is flawed and so would your original perception of the event OR your original perception is not flawed and neither is cbt since they use the same mindset to come to conclusions but just in different ways.",Authentic2017,ha87mp
7,"Ohh that does not sound good, you are right. What I meant by ""not helpful"" is if there is something you can't change, you try to change your response to it. But in your case, it seems, that there is something you can (and should) do, like get away from the abusive person and protect yourself from abuse. The the feelings you are having are not ""not helpful"" in the sense I meant. So you are right, what feelings are helpful is strongly dependent on the reality you are facing. I really do hope no therapist is making you feel like you should stay in an abusive situation, or making you feel like the abuse you feel is not real. If you are trying to find a new therapist, ask them about their views on the kind of abuse you are facing, before committing to therapy with them. Someone who is not set to face your reality is not someone who will be able to help you. I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help, but I do hope for the best for you!",thereborndodo,ha87mp
8,"It's definitely not right, and after reading your other comments I feel for you even more. 

But I think it's a valid treatment for people dealing with things like anxiety (even though it's also harmful for my own anxiety). Just because the nature of abuse treatment needs to be handled differently, and maybe CBT shouldn't be a part of that, doesn't exactly mean that it should be stopped as a whole--just that people should stop using it with abuse victims.",AegilnoprstV,ha87mp
9,"But that's my whole point!  CBT is using the exact same methods to come to a conclusion that an abuser is using to guide their victims to the conclusion.  Sure my existing perception of the event was flawed, but CBT therapists fought over and over and over for me to retain that flawed perception and against me coming to any different perception.  Because according to their methods the view that it wasn't abuse was the correct one and considering that it might have been abusive (when I had only my feelings of hurt and violation to go on) was a cognitive distortion.

&#x200B;

The trouble with a case like mine isn't primarily the ""she did other nice things"" so much as ""she did other things to claim that sexual abuse wasn't actually sexual.""  A large part - and I later learned this isn't uncommon with female abusers - is that most of the abuse was disguised as hygiene, medical care, and so forth.  So an incident of abuse would be overtly referred to as a medical exam or something.

&#x200B;

I don't think any therapist would endorse that something else could make up for sexual abuse - if they actually recognized what happened as sexual abuse in the first place.  But that can be a big if, especially with female abusers.  What actually happened was her overt claim that she was just trying to take care of me (and not doing anything sexual or otherwise inappropriate) combined with her doing a lot of other very nice things was used as evidence that I was just committing an error in thinking her to have ill intent.

&#x200B;

I'm not disputing that my original perception of the event was flawed, but I am stating that it was flawed precisely because of the gaslighting I was receiving at home.  And I'm stating that CBT was billed as the way to see what was really going on while actually replicating that same gaslighting and helping keep me unaware of reality.  And it often seemed to have the same sort of ways of doing so; e.g. asking particular questions about how I might be overreacting (but not underreacting), bringing certain pieces of evidence up at certain times, and so forth.  Basically just treating me going further into denial and accepting the abuse as normal and my reaction as my fault as progress, while treating my trying to question or challenge the abuse as a cognitive distortion.",WarKittyKat,ha87mp
10,"The trouble for me is I entered therapy at a point where I wasn't sure if what I dealt with was abuse or not.  I don't think very many therapists would insist that a client stay in an abusive situation - if the therapist correctly recognizes the situation as abuse.  What happened in my case is that applying the CBT techniques incorrectly  categorized an abusive situation as a supportive one.  (I suspect some of this may have to do with general denial that women can be sexually abusive as well.)  So actually helpful thoughts and feelings were characterized as not helpful because of that.

&#x200B;

At this point it's not that I'm interested in finding another therapist.  I'm interested in why this sort of thing happens and how we stop it.  Especially how we stop it without insisting that traumatized clients be fully aware of their own trauma and fully able to describe it to a therapist, because that's simply not realistic.",WarKittyKat,ha87mp
11,"So that's getting a bit more into the problem I'm looking at though.  See, I was diagnosed with anxiety.  And while I got some screening for abuse, it didn't really cover the stuff I had actually gone through, so I got marked down as not having been abused.  So the result is I'm getting a treatment that is focused on fixing my anxiety in a way that further reinforces that I wasn't abused and that in fact it's only my mental illness that makes me think something is wrong.  Even also in a way that would actively prevent the therapist from being able to get the information needed to recognize that they were actually dealing with an abuse victim.

&#x200B;

The trouble with something that's useful for depression or anxiety is that those kind of are our default diagnoses right now for when someone doesn't necessarily obviously fit into another category.  And I'm concerned that the system is built in a way that reinforces that it is in fact a problem with whatever the therapist diagnosed regardless of whether that's true or not.  So if it's helpful to one group of people, but harmful to another, we need to be really quite sure we know which group a particular client is in in a way I don't see happening.",WarKittyKat,ha87mp
12,"You might want to look into cPt. It is a type of cbt for trauma and it gives you the tools for you to more accurately be able to look at past events and see them more accurately. I’ve done it and I no longer blame myself for certain things I thought I was yo blame for, things I was certain there was no other way of looking at. It’s worth a shot though it’s effortful. If you have any questions regarding it and your situation I’d love to answer",Authentic2017,ha87mp
13,"I'm so sorry to hear of your abusive background. You are right, and it should never happen, that abused and traumatised people are made feel that they are crazy and didn't actually go through (sexual) abuse. That is beyond awful and deeply heartbreaking. It's disturbing to know that it happens. As to your question about how we stop it, I don't have an answer. I think one important thing is making people more aware that yes, women can be sexual predators too. But that does not fix the whole problem. Important question and important topic.",thereborndodo,ha87mp
14,"The trouble for me is I never really blamed myself in the sense that most people think.  I didn't believe that I was at fault for the abuse itself, so much as I believed that what happened was completely normal.  And then I felt like I was mentally ill for overreacting to normal, healthy parenting.  That was the bit CBT latched onto and encouraged, and I haven't seen much discussion of how to handle that.  Like I said, a lot of the abuse was disguised as basic childcare, rather than as punishment or something else where I might deserve it.

&#x200B;

But like I said in a comment below, I'm not really concerned right now with seeking therapy moving forward.  Why would I want therapy when I only made progress when I quit?  What I'm concerned about is why does this happen and how can we stop it, especially among people like me who are diagnosed not with trauma but with mood disorders or similar.  Like, what safeguards is CBT supposed to have that it's not reinforcing that a patient's problem is anxiety because that's what the therapist diagnosed, rather than because that's what's actually going on?",WarKittyKat,ha87mp

1,"Mental health diagnosis is something to be managed very carefully
 Usually an interdisciplinar team will do a better job than one simple professional, so a psychiatrist, a psychologist, and sometimes a neuropsychologist are needed.
The diagnosis is not as important as the treatment itself, once it is helping you manage your symptoms, which is mainly what the first part of the intervention is about.
You could have OCD or PTSD or ADHD oranything else, it rarely matters that much, because the symptoms are the main target at first, so don't worry about the name of what you have. Focus on the process at hand.
To some patients, having a formal diagnosis is more harmful than not having, so there is a right time to give it a name and a dsm code.
Trust the guys who are working with you, perhaps it's your anxiety talking.
CBT is highly effective in providing fast results, so you are probably in good hands.",Hypnotic_Mind,i4ix0b

0,"Yes. CBT didn’t quite do it for me, it was years ago so I’m not sure if it was unsuitable for me or if I wasn’t ready, or both. 

A few years later I did DBT. Dialect Behavioral Therapy (if I’m not mistaken) and found it brilliant. It helps with black and white thinking, impulsiveness (in moods, spending money, binge eating, purging, and especially self harm). 
I did 4 weeks inpatient, Monday to Thursday, rather than 16 weeks outpatient, so I sound that quite difficult being 16 years old. At the last week, it all came together and I noticed things clicked in me. To put it in layman’s terms, DBT is basically about seeing the shades of grey, rather than everything being black and white. (Eg, “my life is the worst”, “everything is bad”, or “everything is brilliant nothing is wrong”). It made it easier to be able to recognize “yeah this situation is a bit shit, but look at all these positives”. It definitely took time but it’s something that definitely rewires your brain and it lasts.  I’m 22 now and still swear by this, and I did it 6 years ago (wow).

CBT is good for surface level anxiety and unlearning patterns of behaviour that are damaging in the short term, but cannot help work through serious long term trauma or understanding why you feel a certain way when there could be serious complexity.

For instance, one time I was doing a program that asked me to list my fear and evidence for and against the fear. I was left with a big long list of reasons to be afraid. That said, a lot of people have been helped by it and that's great. I think it just depends on how you process fears and the reason for your fears.",marshmallowpuppy,2ytx6j
1,"hey, I've done about 15 cbt sessions with a counsellor for anxiety and depression. overall I would not say it's been very helpful for me. I think it can be very helpful for people to rationalise the smaller things when they are not that good at it. For me it was all just common sense and didn't really do much. I already used most of the techniques in some way and it felt a bit belittling, like someone explaining that my feelings aren't valid and trying to find ways to prove me wrong. but that might mostly be because of the counsellor I had. I don't think she was very good, she seemed kinda scared of me, telling me that my life is pretty great and that I shouldn't aim higher, that things I aspire to (normal family, nice job I like and I'm good at) are like the typical American dream and I should forget about it. She would always ask me if there was something I wanted to talk about only to then dismiss it and say we're only supposed to work on small every day issues, when I experience anxiety. Once she almost fell asleep when I told her about my history of sexual abuse. Just saying all those points to show that it might have been her execution of cbt that didn't work for me, rather than cbt itself. However, those things I did learn from her are things that everyone should know about and not something that helps with severe cases of depression/anxiety etc... then again, I met someone who uses cbt for his clients who have experienced psychoses. I just can't image how that would ever help anyone. But it must be helping some people, otherwise it wouldn't be used for such severe cases, I guess?

Just to give an example of how it went for me.
I'd go in, she'd ask me how I've been (same, not well) have I been able to go to university lectures? (no, I couldn't, had a panic attack and no energy) ok, before we begin, is there anything you would like to talk about this week (actually, maybe.... person a is getting more important to me, I started relying too much on them and I don't know if their behaviour is abusive or not and it scares me), ok, well we're not really supposed to talk about those kinds of things. So tell me about your last panic attack? (my last? that was yesterday, wasn't a big deal. went food shopping, all the colours, people, noises, smells, and having to make so many choices as to what to buy and what not to buy had me panicking). How did you deal with that? (I called a friend and asked her for help, she was happy to. wasn't really a big deal, was just a small panic attack, I'm kinda getting used to them. I'm struggling more with uni and person a.) Ok, but let's see how we could use these techniques for when you go food shopping... etc....

3,"I've been having CBT (my last session being tomorrow) about low self esteem and I would say it's worked well.

I would recommend CBT to anyone, you've really got nothing to lose! But like the other user said, it's a lot of ""common sense"" - but unlike their terrible counsellor mine was good so she really did break through the glass and it gave me a lot of realisations about myself, how I think, etc. And the tecniques she taught me were all very new to me :) so I think they're going to stick. Or they better.

What I didn't find helpful was that CBT is all about the now, right now, here. It's got nothing to do with the past, and if your trauma, like a little of mine, came from the past.

11,"I haven't really found a good way to cope with it yet... I have some unhealthy coping strategies, unfortunately (painkillers, weed, sleeping pills, SH, food, too much sleep), but mostly I'm trying to work with it instead of against it. Some days are worse, some days are better, but there's no point beating myself up about it. If I sense it coming I try to stop it in its tracks. Sometimes simply by meeting up with friends, distracting myself, listening to comforting music, doing something nice for myself, or even colouring and oing things I loved as a kid. But if it's past a certain point I just accept it as fighting it makes it worse.

I think one of the worst things in our society is the stigma that comes with mental health. it's a taboo topic, but talking about it has helped so many times. I was fortunate enough to cut out people who weren't understanding (also very helpful for coping with it long term), but most people don't have that option. I also think it's one of the main causes why treatment methods are so vague and not easily accessible. People very often think these things only happen to weak people or people in developing countries or war zones. 'All people have to do is think like me and snap out of it'... not sure if others have experienced this, but that is something I very often encounter. Sometimes people mean it in a positive way, they want to help you. but they have no idea what they are talking about (you're too sensitive, you're obviously a worrier, just drink this tea and you will miraculously be fine again, a friend of a friend of a friend also has this and he had to go to a clinic, so...I understand what you're going through.) IMO if society's attitude towards mental health were to change and take it serious for once, things would get better, research would advance, help would be easily available, less people would suffer from it long term, as they would know how to detect warning signs and wouldn't think twice about getting help. The way it is right now is that everyone seems to know better, no one will talk about it in a respectful manner. I can count on one hand the amount of people who have taken me seriously and actually wanted to help. out of those only one person hadn't had any experience with mental health issues himself and it took him two years to get some sort of understanding. (he was very respectful the entire time though, very rare)

I think cbt might be fine to establish a common ground... it's a bit like teaching a child how to write the letters a-z when they really need to read, understand, compare and contrast a thick book or something.... knowing these techniques can be helpful but they're very basic (and not everyone uses the latin alphabet, to stay with this analogy). I think we're only just at the very beginning of understanding mental health but everyone pretends we know everything about it. Or that going to therapy is a miracle cure, something that is embarrassing but just do it and you will feel better. For me therapy doesn't work (yet, maybe I will find the right fit at some point) and going to therapy is hard work, draining, exhausting, hardly ever helpful. I went, hoping for support and for a solution to my issues, but I felt left alone, with draining homework (cbt diaries) on top of my issues. 

Sorry for the ramble....I just realised I'm very angry about this and kinda feel left alone and betrayed by the nhs...... I just don't understand why cbt is so common and wide spread. It's a bit like going to your school nurse because you cut off your finger and all she can do is give you one paracetamol and a pat on the head. and tell you to walk it off. ",Bonnie_1989,2ytx6j

1,"I always say this first but I'm no doctor or therapist, so please take everything I say with a chunk of salt.

That being said, my recent personal experience with CBT has been to treat chronic neck, chest, shoulder and thoracic pain that is caused by anxiety. So I've been trying to deal with physical manifestations of psychological injury, which sounds somewhat similar to what you have to deal with.

CBT hasn't been a total game changer for me but it has certainly had a significant benefit. For me, mindfulness exercises and techniques have been the biggest help. Consciously directing my attention to my breathing, trying to ""notice without judging"" those automatic negative thoughts to emotionally dull them, etc. 

CBT has several different subsets of techniques and mental exercise types, which makes sense since different people have all sorts of different ways of thinking. I would definitely share these concerns with your therapist if aren't already; doing so can only help them better help you. Perhaps there is a slightly different approach they can use to help you.

Also, don't lose heart when you feel like your CBT techniques aren't helping you all that much. Your mind is like a muscle in that certain thoughts become more automatic the more they are thought. Going one more, certain physiological responses that you might experience (shortness of breath, chest tightness, etc) with these thoughts also tend to become more automatic and almost hardwired to occur as soon as you have specific negative thought. Think of CBT like physical therapy for your mind. The positive, challenging thoughts might not feel effective or powerful at first but the more you use them, the stronger they can get and your mind's ""muscle memory"" will make them easier to use.

Sorry for the wall of text but the tldr of it is that CBT can absolutely help with physiological responses to anxiety, depression. Also, your mind is like a muscle in that if it gets hurt and needs to be retrained, it takes a bit of practice and time to build up it's ""muscle memory"" and strength.

Edit: I don't know if you are taking any medication for anxiety but lots of medical research points to CBT + psychiatric medication being the most effective way to treat anxiety and depression for most people. You could ask your therapist to recommend a physician for you if you think medication could help you. :)",seal_clubb3r,o5dl57

As long as you are reasonable and respectful, there should be no issue telling your therapist that you think he is doing therapy wrong for you. 

To expand a bit, the positive thinking and breathing stuff actually is part of CBT but CBT isn't the only kind of therapy. Think about what you want to learn about yourself through therapy. Do you want to excavate your childhood? Formulate a purpose for living? Face things you hate about yourself? Tell your therapist exactly what you want to get out of therapy and that positive thinking isn't giving it to you. Stating the obvious and asking questions is also a standard part of therapy - it's a technique called reflection. The idea is that it can prompt people to think through their own emotions and mental processes without the therapist leading them, as that risks substituting the therapist's ideas about the client for the client's own ideas. But you can still say it's not working for you. There are other techniques. Sometimes I feel like I would never get anything done in therapy if I didn't tell my therapist how to give me therapy lol.

you do an interview with the therapist to find out if you and they are a good fit. you might have to pay for one session in order to do this. maybe not though.

ask questions like:

- what are their specializations? they should match your situation. like if you're having trouble with abusive family members, there are therapists specializing in that.

- how they do therapy? what methods do they use? if someone says something about God and you're an atheist, that probably won't work well for you.

- what should you (the patient) do (and not do) in order to get the most benefit from the therapy sessions?

I don't know, but **Wikipedia says**:



Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology.

Rights are fundamental to any civilization and the history of social conflicts is often bound up with attempts both to define and to redefine them. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ""rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived"".

0,"I think some of your complaints are valid, but some are predicated on misunderstandings.

>So the basic premise of CBT is that ""distorted thoughts"" are the root of mental illness

This is incorrect.  CBT does not postulate about what is or isn't the cause of mental illness.  A more accurate thing to say is that CBT posits that distorted thoughts exacerbate the symptoms of mental illness and restructuring our thoughts can reduce our suffering.  So you are wrong to presume that CBT's approach toward reducing suffering says anything at all about what the root causes of mental illness are.

>One thing I noticed about the above-linked ""list of cognitive distortions"" is that it doesn't really correspond to any list of objective logical fallacies

And it shouldn't.  Another basic premise of CBT is that facts are not feelings and vice versa.  It could be logically fallacious to believe you are smart and capable and good things will always happen to you in your future, but someone who thinks that way is statistically less likely to suffer from depression than someone whose outlook is more ""realistic"" if you will.  It's not about identifying whether or not the things we think are true, it's about identifying whether or not the things we think are causing us harm. 

>it's something that can pretty much be applied to ANYONE who complains about anything. 

I think it goes without saying that any thought can be restructured, but the metric used to decide which thoughts to apply this to is whether or not they are adaptive.  If it's a thought that is helping the thinker in achieving their goals, then it's not a thought that CBT is going to target.

>I can absolutely have a good workout, then meet a friend for coffee, and feel fucking terrible afterwards, meaning that it's a constant struggle to even keep that baseline going. 

If you think that CBT does not allow for things like this to be true, then I say again I think you aren't quite clear on what it's about.

>The biggest problem, I find, is that CBT simply doesn't cover very much of the experience

I'm not really clear on exactly what you mean when you say this.

For instance, there's curiosity (some days more, some days none at all), contentment (very rare, I'm perpetually high-strung, even after exercise); there's the ability to connect ideas and formulate thoughts, which I notice is much better some days than others. Then there are long spells of amorphous grey anhedonia, and on the flip side, combinations of emotions that don't really fit into one category like ""sad"" or ""angry"".

Also, most ""thoughts"" are not really verbal statements like in the examples... they're much more slippery.

The ""homework"" I was given for CBT frankly didn't address or allow space for any of this. In short, it didn't feel like it was about *me*, but rather a simplistic conjecture of what ""thoughts"" I might be having that are making me depressed, and a prescription for thoughts I *should* be having instead.",almostambidextrous,7im5dr

It might sound like a lot when I summarise like that but your therapist will work through it all a bit at a time with you so by the end you'll understand it all too. It did help me a lot (even though I'm still far from where I want to be, I'm making good progress).

1,"I did regular therapy (just talking about feelings and stuff), then moved on to CBT, and CBT ended up helping me a ton, more than anything else. 

In CBT, I learned the most important thing I ever have about anxiety: that anxious feelings come from automatic thoughts, and automatic thoughts come from inaccurate underlying beliefs about yourself.

Once my CBT therapist helped me understand my underlying beliefs (they were terrible, horrible beliefs about myself), I learned how to identify which of my thoughts are troublesome automatic thoughts, and once I learned that, I stopped believing in them so much. 

Then I learned to behave in ways that countered those automatic thoughts, did exposure therapy, etc, etc.

3,"Got some questions....Starting to see a therapist tomorrow to work on CBT. I saw one in the past that helped me apply some coping techniques. But I feel like I never stick to it. Hoping this time is different. 

These underlying beliefs you talk about. Is that like these reoccurring feelings you go back to when you can't cope. Like I'm a failure. I never follow through. Shit like that. I feel I fall down into that rabbit hole and just can't rebound. Let's say a work situation overwhelms me. I know I can tackle it but I just get stuck in this rut. And lately I have been giving up a lot. Actually crying. Sucks. 

Also, the shit hit the fan with me in Feb when I broke my leg skiing. All of my go to activities were taken away. Dog walks. Exercise. Freedom of mobility. I think that's been playing a huge part of it. 

I guess my question is...the underlying beliefs, is that like you just feeling bad about yourself? Feeling like you don't love yourself? Right now, I don't ever see how that could change. ",,4ht8hc
4,"That's awesome that you're seeing a therapist tomorrow! Especially if you've been having tough times, and especially now that you can't do all of those awesome healthy activities. That really sucks :(

An underlying belief is a belief that you carry around with you all the time, and you use it to interpret the world, even if you are coping. Like, for example, I had an underlying belief that *I'm defective*. So, even when something positive happened like my gf at the time said that she loved me, I would have automatic thoughts like this: ""She must be stupid if she loves me because I'm a piece of shit"", or  ""I feel sorry for her for loving me because I'm worthless"", or ""she thinks she loves me, but she doesn't really""...stuff like that. I can see that they're incorrect, but when they were happening in my brain, they felt real!

I definitely hear you with that rabbit hole problem. A bad situation causes a bad automatic thought, which leads to another one, which leads to another one...but just going to the therapist is a huge step that shows that you want to get better and that you're willing to put in work to do it. I think that if you go and keep going, that will lead to you doing good work on your own, etc., and you'll start feeling WAY better.",cardboardington,4ht8hc

0,"Not a professional but here are some thoughts/opinions/remark about your question. 

> Does this mean depression is really just all in your head?

Yes and No. It depends on what causes someone to be depressed. There certainly can be psychological reasons, environmental reasons and even brain dysfunction (although this is very poorly understood). 

This is a very delicate topic because depression is really just a label for a wide spectrum of problems that may have absolutely nothing in common except the obviously visible symptoms. There's also no clear line.

Where's the line between lazy and mentally ill? If you're lazy you don't want to be called lazy, because that's negative, being mentally ill gives you an excuse. But maybe you're still trying your best, but are still perceived as lazy. Are you lazy now? The difference is the internal motivation. A lazy person doesn't want to do things, a non-lazy person wants, but if that person can't then it looks the same as a lazy person? So how do we tell them apart? We don't. We can't. It's a gray area. 

It's not a hard line. Some people are bad at math because they didn't learn it well or enough, maybe they thought it's not worth the effort, others spend hours trying to learn it but still are bad at it. 

Depression is exactly in that same gray area... you can't tell. 

It's the same with eating disorders. Naively the solution is obvious: You just need to eat. But why do people not eat if eating is that simple? Either they don't want to eat or maybe there's some internal voice/thought process that tells them not to eat. Is this just all in your head? Maybe. We don't know. Maybe there's an organic brain problem, maybe there isn't, maybe some have an organic problem and for others it's purely psychological. We don't know. 

Depression is the same. Maybe there's an organic problem in the brain, maybe there isn't. Maybe some depressed people have an organic problem in the brain and for others it's purely psychological. For others it might be environmental/circumstancial. Bad things induce bad mood. If bad things constantly happen to you... your mood is going to be constantly bad but saying that there's a problem in the brain would be wrong and saying it's just in the head isn't exactly correct either because it's an expected reaction to a negative stimuli. 

Maybe psychological stress changes things in the brain like receptors get less sensitive etc. which causes depression which makes it hard to get out of depression. Maybe the brain downregulates emotions to not be overwhelmed and since in the end everything is just chemicals an electrics it may in fact have started to produce less of some chemicals in which case the argument that it's all in your head isn't correct either... except from a physiological standpoint it would actually be all in your head but the point is: We have no clue. Medicine isn't there yet to give you an answer. 
If the brain downregulates transmitters maybe it can learn to upregulate them again without medication. 

There are groups that view a lot of mental illnesses as environmental. In their eyes depression is a reaction to external negative stimuli and the brain adapts to those. The only way to treat it is to provide external positive stimuli so the brain can re-adapt again. In this case, there's little you can do by yourself to treat depression, you can only try to get into situations where there could be potential positive stimuli but if you're not getting positive stimuli you're going to stay depressed.... thus you can't exactly say it's the fault of the depressed person.

On the more extreme end you have self harm behaviours. Why do people cut themselves? Because they feel like it. It's an urge. The solution seems simple: Just don't cut yourself. But it doesn't stop the urge. It's like trying to starve yourself to death... you're going to want to eat and not eating isn't that simple because your body tells you to eat. Or compare it with stopping to smoke. It's easy, right? Just don't put a cigarette in your mouth. But so many people fail at stopping to smoke, because it's not actually this easy. Is that just in your head? Even if it is, it's not that simple. People are going to be pissed when you say 'x is just in your head' because even if it is, in their view it invalidates their suffering. 

There's helpful and there's unhelpful behaviour. Social isolation makes people depressed so in order to avoid that you need to socialize. You can thus say that if a person stops socializing.... that's an unhelpful behaviour and it's going to worsen depression or cause depression. So what you can do is teach people what helpful and what unhelpful behaviours are and not only teach them... but encourage them to do that or in an ideal world you would actually help people and in an ideal world the MHS would offer places for people to socialize etc... but there's no money in that and it's apparentely too much work so currently nobody is doing that. Similar there's rumination. You can teach people that thinking about the same thing over and over again isn't helpful... because it's not going to change anything so you can teach them to try to take their mind off it and think about something else if they notice they start ruminating. If the problem is purely psychological, there's some chance this will work without medication. You know... sometimes people get in a rut and need a kick in the ass to get out of it. It happens... if you're in that rut you don't like getting kicked in the ass... but ultimatively... everybody knows it's the right thing to do... but still... the person in the rut doesn't like it. But maybe for some a kick in the ass just doesn't cut it, maybe they need more, maybe the psychological stress has caused _permanent_ changes in the brain that require medications. Nobody knows. 

Other people internalize their mental illness, they define themselves by having it making it hard to treat them because losing it would also mean they lose part of their identity. They have their circles of fellow sufferers and only have contact with those then write posts everyday about what their illness means etc. and then yell at everybody who tells them that this behaviour isn't really helpful... then they start explaining their behaviour through those illnesses (I do X because Y) and you're in the same gray area again. How much of your (mis)behaviour can you blame on a mental illness and how much is your fault? I don't have an answer to that, it's not a hard line. Usually the treatment involves teaching patients that their mental illness isn't an excuse for those behaviours because as long as they use this excuse... they will do those behaviours and that they need to take responsibility for the behaviours and not blame them on their mental illness... even though they have the mental illness. But this yields to another question... Mental ilnesses _describe_ behaviours. There's not excatly a causative relationship there. Kinda like a person can't see because the person is blind, the person is blind because the person can't see because blind is defined as the inability to see so blindness doesn't cause an inability to see... inability to see is what causes the label ""blind"" to apply. You don't necessarily misbehave because you have a mental illness.. you have the mental illness because you misbehave in that way. So in some way... you're not sad because you have Depression... but you have Depression because you're sad. The underlying pathologies just aren't understood so nobody knows yet hat is a causative relationship and what is just ""per definition"". 

Is a criminal a criminal because there's something in the brain making him/her a criminal? Obviously yes, otherwise they wouldn't be a criminal and we're basically brains in a fleshy boody. But where's the line between ""it's his/her fault"" and ""it's not his/her fault because it's in the brain""? How much can we blame on the person, and how much can we blame on the brain of that person? 

It's all just one huge gray area with no definite answer. Pick the answer you like best, but please don't be rude to people who think another answer is better... until science actually comes up with the right answer. ",,79yg15
1,"Not a mental health professional at all. 

I see it myself as there is an extremely tight cause and effect relationship between our thoughts, our behaviors/actions, and our brain chemistry.  Interventions into any of those areas have all been shown to have effectiveness in treating depression.

So yes, I wouldn't disagree it's all in your head.  But if you look at something like neuroplasticity you also see that the more a pathway fires in the brain, the stronger it gets (so for instance why practice improves skill), and that can create a large hurdle to get out of, especially if the brain chemistry which seems to cause that is there too.",dunno260,79yg15

I have social anxiety that was never there before I got depression and the thing is forced social interaction also doesn't get rid of it because I am having trouble AND I verified that close friends do notice that socially I'm not the same which again is a 2nd verification that this needs to be fixed asap.

8,"Sounds like you want to move the whole mountain at once, and I just don't think the therapy tools are that sort of remedy.   I see them more as aids to stop the decline, and then rebuild each piece of your life, and then as pieces work, your mood climbs along with them, you reinforce that positive improvement, and keep building.    

I got real bad early this summer, it even added some seductive features I'd never had, particularly a very large increase in the number of hours I was sleeping; it even felt kinda good.  Then I realized what it was doing, and started the long climb back.   I still don't enjoy my gaming; and I'm still having trouble with making progress on large scale projects, but I'll get there, and my mood is improving.

I notice you say you want a fast improvement.   SSRI's are considered fast, and they take at least a month or two to do their thing, if you got the right one.  If a month is considered medically boosted fast, try to think of the therapy tools as an exercise over some months (or years) to recover.   

Depression isn't a common cold.  Its a cancer; don't give up!

edit/addenda - I didn't really address stillness; and you're right, its much easier to type that word, than to make the mind still and present to the world and your body.

9,"I understand that yea. The thing is though with school and everything its impossible to wait that long for therapy to work when the symptoms are there. Its difficult to try it when I get so agitated that its not working and I need acute relief so I can accomplish my goals at school given that taking time off is also not an option anymore. I already had a full summer off this year (and right now I'm on winter break anyways) and it still doesn't change the way I feel. So I concluded that I don't have any stress problems since eliminating all stressors doesn't work but just that the way I feel is the root problem of everything. 

I also wanted to avoid the meds primarily due to sexual side effects which would just further diminish any self esteem I have left. On top of that, emotional numbing is absolutely not what I want considering that my main issue is not feeling motivation due to depression. Numbing emotions and sex drive would further lower that motivation. ",lightstreaker2,5k9yzq
10,"First, I'm not suggesting you're making the wrong decision about meds; but rather, that you should understand what your choices were, and that each choice has consequences.   Yes, SSRI's certainly have side effects, and you find them unacceptable.  That is OK.   (you do know they'll generally prescribe viagra and friends for those side effects if you ask, yes?)

Your choices were, and still are:

Meds+Talk, fast'ish, sexual and emotional side effects.

Talking/skill therapy, slow, low side effects.

That said, again, I think you're trying to move the mountain of your mood.   Target your school assignment with the therapy, and let work completion pull your mood up.   Each time I pull myself through even a 2-3 hour task at work, my mood makes a tiny, miniscule improvement; but the task does get done, and I stay employed. Yeah, I still get baited, ""dude, just take a nap, get a cookie, just rest a bit more..."" but I choose to let them pass, it is ok that I thought about napping, but I choose to complete the task I have before me anyway.  Sometimes I fail too and find myself laying down, even though I know what that means.  Get back up, no guilt, and just try again.   That's all I can do.

Poor mood makes it harder, but the tools you now know can let you finish that book, or write that report, or even complete that test in the allotted time, anyway.    And when you do, you'll set down another candle against the darkness.

11,"Yea I think if there were meds that weren't SSRIs/SNRIs which cause sexual sides I'd try em out for sure.

I'm particularly worried about PSSD which although very rare won't help my anxiety thinking about it...

I know Wellbutrin doesn't have those sides though but problem being my doc refused to prescribe it saying that I have a significant anxiety component which could be worsened by it. 

I guess I could start with trying to be more self compassionate about work/school bc I tend to compare to my nondepressed old self and never match up which gets me down considering that before depression a lot of my self esteem was academic related/grades etc. So when depression hit for no real outside reasons and I couldn't do those things as well it also hit my self esteem.

1,"CBT is a hands on treatment, and it is a good approach for GAD. You and your therapist will work together as a team to find ways to manage your anxiety. This will involve trying some things in therapy and then doing practice throughout the week to try the new skills in your day to day life. Another advantage of CBT is that it is time limited, so the goal is to teach you skills so you can manage your anxiety without your therapist week to week. Many therapists offer “booster” sessions after therapy has ended to check in on how things are going.

[Alcoholics Anonymous](http://www.aa.org/), [Marijuana Anonymous](https://www.marijuana-anonymous.org/) and/or [Narcotics Anonymous](https://www.na.org/) can be helpful. Or using the [SAMHSA facility locator]( https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/) online to find a detox & rehab. 

2) If one is NOT doing the above, they may need lab work to determine if they have hormonal (e.g.: thyroid) or metabolic (e.g.: low Vitamin D3) imbalances. See a competent MD, DO, PA or NP. (To find one in your area, look on the ""psychiatrists"" section of the *Psychology Today*.com clinician locator, or the ""find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry"" section of the WebMD website; and the SAMHSA's treatment facility locator. 

5) Books and academic, *professional* websites including Mayo Clinic, WebMD, NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health), NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), and even Wikipedia (when everything asserted is solidly documented with citations). Strongly recommended because they all understand the upshots of having been stressed into fight, flight or freeze for too long, including complex PTSD: Bessel van der Kolk, Peter Levine, Patricia Ogden, Ronald Kurtz, Laurence Heller, Bruce McEwen, Sonya Lupien and Robert Sapolsky. Look for an online article entitled ""[Treat Autonomic AND Cognitive Conditions in Psychopathology?](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2017/01/treat-autonomic-and-cognitive.html)"" to get you oriented. *Accurate* information is power.

9) Moderate Exercise: Because it is the single healthiest of the distractions one can use to yank oneself out of the paradigm for a while... *and* it can help to ""massage"" the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy.

10) Diet: A lot of people with depression, mania and/or anxiety eat *very* poorly. Junk food -- not to mention too *little* nutritious food -- will definitely impact those who are overly stressed and make symptoms worse. High-quality frozen meals are better than McFood of almost any kind, but HQ *fresh* (especially Mediterranean -- though not *pizza* -- and Asian) food appears to be best for pts with C-PTSD symptoms. *Healthy* fats in moderation, btw, are known to be good for depression. Add a 1000 IU soft gel of Vitamin D3, too.

5,Ok yea I have indeed found out I have some of the biological stuff like HPA deregulation but the problem is nobody seems to know how to actually solve the issue. Drs all just recommend CBT or other psychotherapies essentially even though the problem didn't start from stress. They say I need to calm down my mind to let the body recover. Sounds easy on paper but difficult in practice when all I can think about is the low mood. A vicious cycle basically :( ,lightstreaker2,6507rj
6,"Considering the HPA > [ANS](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=autonomic+nervous+system) dysregulation, I'll plug some things I had pulled out *back* into my reply above:

6) Psychotherapy: I currently use Ogden's **Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T) as the ""interoceptive"" 9th of [The 10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing)** to manage any C-PTSD time bombs that turn up, but had good results over the years with several of the 

. . . a) cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs), including Rational-Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), collegiate critical thinking,  and Schema Therapy; the 

. . . b) ""super"" (or mindfulness-based) CBTs like Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), **Dialectical Behavior Therapy** (DBT), Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mind-Body Bridging Therapy (MBBT), and **Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction** (MBSR); and the

. . . c) ""deep cleaners"" like Eye-Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing (EMDR), Hakomi Body Centered Psychotherapy (HBCP), Somatic Experiencing Psychotherapy (SEPt), Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T), and the Neuro-Affective Relational Model (NARM).

One can look up all of those by name online. The CBTs deconstruct one's inaccurate beliefs, values, ideals, principles, convictions, rules, codes, regulations and requirements about how we or they (or the world) should / must / ought / have to be.  DBT, MBCT, ACT, MBBT and MBSR are terrific for emotional symptom management. EMDR, HBCT, SEPt, SP4T and NARM are first-rate for memory-reprocessing, sense-making and detachment from the conditioning, programming, etc. 

To find the clinicians who know how to use these psychotherapies, look on the ""therapists"" and ""psychiatrists"" sections of the *Psychology Today*.com clinician locator, or the ""find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry"" section of the WebMD website; the SAMHSA's treatment facility locator, and -- for DBT specialists in particular -- on the Behavioraltech.org website. If you dig a little on each page, you will be able to see which therapies they use. Then interview *them* as though they were applying for a job with *your* company. Most psychiatrists, btw, are *not* therapists themselves (they are medication specialists), but can refer you to those who are, and are often excellent sources of referral.

7) **Mindfulness Meditation**: Try the Vipassana or Theravada Meditation styles? (For a *lot* of people with anxiety, unwanted mania and depression, this stuff handles them all chop chop. Many of the modern ""mindfulness""-based psychotherapies are actually based on these now.) The article ""The Feeling is Always Temporary"" at pairadocks.blogspot.com provides a nice summation of it.

8) **Therapy Workbooks**: I got a lot of lift-off by using inexpensive workbooks built on CBT, ACT, DBT, MBBT and MBCT workbooks like [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=stanley+block+mind+body+bridging+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=CBT+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=ACT+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=DBT+therapy+workbooks).
",not-moses,6507rj
7,"So when there is no particular incident or trauma causing the symptoms then what therapies would be  the better one? Im not getting much mileage with CBT.

Im so frustrated that its because my brain/SNS/HPA axis are all fucked up and causing these symptoms. ",lightstreaker2,6507rj
8,"The symp NS has to be triggered by *something*. A perception or an evaluation can do it. Obsessive rumination, too. 

Aside from that, the notion of ""thought stopping"" may be a contributor to the continuation of symptoms. TS was somebody's good idea 40 or 50 years ago (but it was *not* [Albert Ellis](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Albert+Ellis)'s, even though it's been mis-attributed to him a zillion times). In fact, there is no such thing. Thoughts come, they're here, and then they move on. (Well. Look to *see* whether that's true or not.) 

It's not about stopping -- or even questioning -- them. It's about *mindfully* observing to notice to recognize to acknowledge to accept to own to appreciate to understand to make it possible to process / digest / metabolize and discharge the thought and its attached emotions. One can do that [this way](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mind-Body Bridging Therapy (MBBT), Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), or Therevada or Vipassana style meditation. ""[Interoception](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-10-steps-ogdens-sensorymotor.html)"" is the bomb. 

Been doing it that way for several years. My HPA>ANS is is *waaaay* less active as a direct result. :-)",not-moses,6507rj
9,So is a cornerstone to HPA recovery besides nutritional and exercise components to recognize that the thoughts and feelings are coming from a fucked up HPA/SNS and letting them go until the HPA/SNS reaches the previous homeostatic setpoint?,lightstreaker2,6507rj
10,"Not directly. The HPA is actually part of a long chain that leads back to the insula and amygdala with other projections to and from the media pre-frontal cortices and the hippocampus. Understand the functions of all of them, and the whole business of anxiety being linked to evaluations according to beliefs in a multi-modal feedback loop begins to make sense. Sorry I can't grind it down any further than that. The operations of the brain are complex, but with the help of folks like Joe LeDoux, Mike Gazzaniga, Lou Cozolino, Bruce McEwen, Iain McGilchrist, and the other ""scan masters,"" we began to have a much better handle on it all in the '90s. 

But -- to answer your question -- the same sort of self-awareness (a.k.a. ""mindfulness"" in current psycho-parlance) the vedic medicine men were selling in India 2500 years ago works pretty well to chill out those feedback loops. Not quite ""instantly,"" but usually in minutes. And over time, raising the trigger threshold *and* lowering the degree of reactivity throughout but rebalancing the amounts of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine at the synaptic junctions between the neurons in those chains. In time resting cortisol levels rebound less and less, resulting in less ACTH > CRF > adrenaline flooding. Vastly more ""organic"" (and less productive of sfx) than what happens when anti-Ds and major or minor tranqs are adminstered. ",not-moses,6507rj
11,"Im having more depression than anxiety and the thing is I wake up depressed without any thoughts or anything behind it! My only thought is ""fuck I woke up depressed"" which I guess elicits the stress response but I would still like to prevent the low mood from occurring to begin with. That thought occurs after the trigger of low mood. But if the low mood didn't occur, then the subsequent stress response also won't occur. 

So its kind of weird I don't have the fight flight anxiety but I have anxiety about my low mood. I just wish I didn't have the low mood in the first place since there isn't anything specific in my life to trigger it. I just hate how so many of the books in this field talk about events that happen in ppls lives to cause this stuff but I feel like I cannot connect to those stories since mine is out of the blue and related to the HPA axis.

Either way if I can somehow stop the low mood from occuring that would help. I know they make pharmaceuticals for that but we all know about the risks with those....",lightstreaker2,6507rj

1,"I'll write more (specific details) here for anyone who cares to read:

I *kinda* agree with the premise of ""changing thoughts""—I'm no longer the timid person I used to be after all that bullying, and as I said, grew out of OCD (*and I did both of these without therapy or medication, although it probably cost me about decade of my life*).

*That said*, the premise of CBT is still largely rubbish — though, yes, I CAN deal with people now, I'm still deeply, instinctively anxious in their presence, and most of my inner monologue feels so idiosyncratic that trying to ""express myself"" inevitably feels like a performance. It's debilitating and has cost me many opportunities where I would have *dearly* liked to succeed.

""Overthinking"" has been and probably always will be a problem. Therapy hasn't helped: the people writing the materials seemingly describe what they *imagine* it's like, in line with their hypothesis that excessive fear comes from ""distorted thoughts"", specifically, ""catastrophising"": I would say want I really want to say, but ""*oh my God what will people think! they'll hate me!*""

—yeeaaaaah, NO. Not that simple.

This is a big problem with how they label things, I reckon: I assume (optimistically) it's meant as a useful device for patients who have never thought in this way before to start to look at themselves, but in practice it's become a way for barely-qualified, overpaid idiots to tell their unfortunate patients what they're thinking and why they're suffering, while having no real insight on the matter AT ALL.

*****

And again, it's a pretty shallow effect! It is an essential element of becoming well, I agree — the patient has to overcome some habitual hurdles and be willing to change — but my word by itself it's *shite*. It is fucking *shite*. We were given a handout in my DBT classes citing a study claiming how enormously effective it was, and when it looked it up at home ...yes, a large percentage of patients had ""improved"", but that improvement was considered relative to their former history of regular ER visits and self-destructive behaviour: following DBT, they did those things... less. ""Significant""? OK, technically YES, but it's not a very high bar. Other studies I've noted (this was not advertised in our hand-out) mentioned that patients after treatment had overall psycho-social functioning: *poor, well below average*.

Like, c'mon. You could interpret that to mean that the biggest effect of DBT is that it makes people feel more *guilty* about going to the ER and causing trouble, and that would be equally valid.

But they chose to mislead. They chose to highlight ""scientifically-proven effectiveness"" while being deliberately coy about what that means.

*****

Again, it feels to me like a cult that gets most of its mileage out of people *believing* in it, rather than from actual substance.",almostambidextrous,apmv5f
2,"It could be true. If it is, what do you want to do about it?",iRanting,apmv5f
3,"Well, to be fair, I tried to put that out front: I don't identify with ...why... it does what it does, and my reflections (e.g. the AA comparison) are my best attempt to put that into context, while also (admittedly) venting some of frustration that I've had to learn DBT language just to talk effectively to a lot of health professionals.

(e.g.: I used to say ""controlling emotion"", but they'd frequently interrupt to say, ""*you can't control emotions!*"" ...so I've switched to saying, ""regulate emotions"", and now they're OK with it—I was talking about exactly the same thing!, I just wasn't familiar with the word ""regulate"" in that context in my early days of therapy. Frankly, I do not find such pedantry to be helpful, even though I AM VERY MUCH a word nerd)

This probably isn't JUST a matter of CBT/DBT, but that's what I'm familiar with, so that's how I'm portraying it.

Is there anything in particular I said with you disagree?",almostambidextrous,apmv5f
4,"You have to admit....DBT often likes to present its ideas in (arguably) dogmatic, slightly mystical ways, so that even when (I think?) I already get them, I remember feeling not really sure... like... am I missing something here? Is this really significant?

We had to chant ""*wise mind*"". Why? Is there really some secret, deep truth in that Venn (or Euler?) diagram that I should be meditating upon it? It was frustrating.

This is what I mean when I say it's ""hard to relate to""—unless it already speaks to you on some level, the whole thing seems senseless and arbitrary.

That's fine if it DOES work; what I resent is the particular assumption (on the part of many people) that it JUST IS, that there's some deeper Universal truth in there.",almostambidextrous,apmv5f
5,"And just for a moment... can we talk about ""skills""?

In any other context, if somebody offered to sell you a ""skill"" and provided little more than a forced acrostic with some vague explanation of its meaning, you'd take them to court.

I think that DBT (and other therapy) ""skills"" are just as much dodgy marketing. Let's be honest here: they're really just generic rules: not *the worst*, but not great, and yes, if you follow them for awhile, depending where you're coming from, you may find that you've gotten better at dealing with people or whatever, but that's just *practice* happening—real ""skill"" isn't something you get from a half-assed mnemonic, and real people aren't that predictable.

Selling them as ""skills"", IMO, is dishonest... and in America, at least, they most certainly are SOLD.

I always found it weird that so much of DBT that I attended —without America, even— was so much based on Marsha Linehan herself, like, actually mentioning *her*, how *she* overcame [BPD, in my case, but other people have told me that it was bipolar disorder or even schizophrenia], listening to her tapes, hearing her thoughts, and talking about her books... um, I'm not her? so why should that even be relevant? ...I dunno, there must be a line in the training manual or something: you *don't* generalise DBT. It's a story about how this SPECIFIC process and these SPECIFIC beliefs ended up with this one woman feeling truly well and fancy, with a PhD to boot.

I find it all very suspect. Maybe I'm just old school, but I feel like a proper scientist (i.e. NOT a flaky self-help guru) would have approached their invention a bit differently.",almostambidextrous,apmv5f

7,"Thanks for replying.

You're describing learning. It goes without saying, I reckon, that behaviour alters the brain over time, but it's a bit of a leap to conclude, straight up, ""*it cures mental health problems*"":

To extend the hoop example:

- maybe the hoop is connected to your fire alarm (*you learn to become averse to it, more than getting better at throwing*).

- maybe for some reason you can't see the hoop, and spend a year blinding throwing a ball into the air (*you don't learn the relevant skill, as objectives are poorly set up*).

- maybe you're an ice hockey goalie (*you're spending time learning something irrelevant to your needs*).

0,"I don't have an opinion as to whether you can get better, but I can say that CBT worked wonders for me. I struggle primarily with anxiety that comes with a nice side-serving of depression, and I struggled here and there with it for about eight years but it wasn't until about four years ago it got really bad for about two years. I saw a really lovely therapist for about two months, short time but I kinda took what she taught me and like you, went with it online and kinda learned what works for me. I think the biggest difference I've noticed is when my fight or flight response kicks in, I used to run away every time, but now I can just take deep breaths, walk myself through my thoughts, and calm myself down. It's also been a matter of just finding little ""rituals"" that work for me, little calming things I like every day.

0,"Good on you for looking and asking important questions! CBT is a great therapy modality and evidence based treatment. To give you some clarity, counselors/therapists are typically masters level clinicians with training in therapy. They can not write prescriptions. Moreover, they are lisenced by their respective state. Be sure to check that the person is qualified and lisenced and not a ""life coach."" Psychologists are doctorate level clinicians with training in therapy and assessment. They also do not write prescriptions. Psychiatrists are medical doctors. They can write prescriptions for medication. While some have some training in providing therapy, not all do. Therapists and psychologists have extensive training in therapy and it's modalities like CBT and often specialize in the treatment of specific conditions. In terms of therapy, I personally think that working with a therapist or psychologist is best and if you need medication, they can refer you to a psychiatrist. 

I think a good way to find a therapist is looking through your insurance like you're already doing! After you get some names from your insurance, you can read more about them online on sites like Psychology Today or their own personal website. A good thing to look for is that they specialize is CBT and have experience with the things you'd like to work on. If possible, it can be helpful to have a first session with a few different people and see who you click well with.

1,"Caffeine definitely affects persons with ADHD.Coffee makes me feel a bit sleepy/calm, but also jittery. lots of caffeine makes me feel less sleepy + heart racing. when paired with sedatives, the effects of the sedatives are notably reduced. Especially the effects that make me feel sleepy/drowsy/dopey.

Amphetamine doesnt make me feel 'awake' or 'energized' but it makes me feel focused, and inspired, which is usually enough to keep me awake longer. It also counteracts some side effects of being awake for long hours, or being tired, about as much as being REALLY into a video game or a book that i'd stay up all night reading/playing it without noticing the time go by.

From my experiences with people who do NOT have an adhd diagnosis, who have used the drug, or have used caffeine, they have very similar but still personalized experiences with them. I doubt that all dozen or so of them just have undiagnosed adhd.

The cause of adhd is indeterminate, and is just a classification of co-morbid symptoms proven to be more manageable with the use of stimulants.

Most of the people in my life would say that i have VERY HIGH functioning adhd & etc. to the point where i do not appear to have adhd & etc. to anyone except for my closest friends and family outside of the occasional absence from work.

I have had sleep related problems for as long as I can remember. So problematic in fact that it was perceived as sleep apnea, then depression, then manic episodes, then and now in my later years, caffeine/sugar/stimulant abuse. But after treatment for all of the above with little to no effect, all of the above have been ruled out. Sleep related issues being chronic fatigue, insomnia, mania, and narcolepsy. in my experience, stimulants are 80% effective at reducing or negating the negative side effects of the above.

My biggest issues with focus and anxiety etc. could easily be explained by the sleep issues, which have been present forEVER, but are diagnosed as adhd.  


growing up, most of the people and friends i knew with adhd also abused sugar/caffeine/stimulants profusely. They also tended to avoid weed/alcohol, (but hung out almost exclusively with stoners and boozers) which could be relevant.",nullbear,b59aug

1,"The first portion of therapy is called intake and this is a process of constructing a history of the patient and identifying the sorts of problems that they want to overcome.    It sounds like you did an intake and got a little stuck on the problem identification section.  That's totally normal.  Thinking in terms of concrete goals and problems rather than the general symptoms (e.g. depression, anxiety, etc.) is much more difficult, and part of therapy is the identification of these goals and problems.  

Basically, your therapist gave you homework, which is a big part of CBT.  The idea isn't that the therapist is like a cancer doctor who performs a surgery, it's more along the lines of a partnership in which your therapist guides you toward more healthy thinking patterns and actions.  But you have to play your part by doing the actual work.  Your homework now is to think about specific things that are getting in the way of you achieving your goals.

Start small, don't think big, and don't worry about being ""wrong."" CBT is predicated on the idea that depression/anxiety/etc are caused by harmful thinking patterns in everyday life, often in response to bothersome life situations.  Those are the situations that *you* have to identify because you're the one who's being bothered by them.  By learning to deal better with those situations and the thoughts that arise, you can apply the same thinking to new situations as they come up.  

So don't stress about identifying the ""right"" or ""true"" thing, just be mindful of your feelings, frustrations, and roadblocks that you run into over the next week or so and keep those in mind for your next appointment.

CBT is a little dry like this, but the thing is, it can be really helpful.  Many people when they think of psychology are influenced by popular cultural representations of it, which are usually based in the psychoanalytic tradition of psychology.  This is the one where you lie back on a chair and try to figure out whether your mom forgetting you at the store caused a lifelong fear of abandonment.  The thing about psychoanalysis is that, while it's really interesting to learn the root causes of your issues, knowing the causes doesn't mean you have the tools to deal with them.  Psychoanalysis, then, is very backwards looking.  CBT, on the other hand, is forward looking and concerned about how to provide the patient with the tools to move forward.  

The data on outcomes bears this out.  CBT is consistently shown to be efficacious in treating various mental ailments.  Psychoanalysis, on the other hand, has much poorer outcomes in the long run.  ",TrontRaznik,8jwhx8
2,This is really helpful. Thanks very much. Any advice about how to think more granularly about 'problems'?,auzijamesaustin,8jwhx8
3,"You're very welcome.

It's hard to give advice specific to your situation because I don't know anything about you.  Generally speaking though, the idea is to break apart the big stuff into small concrete things.  Here's a sample conversation that illustrates this (and also introduces some common errors in thinking that lead to depression/anxiety).

> I hate my job and it's making me miserable (vague)
> 
> What do you hate about your job?
> 
> My boss is a jerk (still vague, but narrowing in)
> 
> What sorts of things does your boss do that upset you?
> 
> He's always coming down on me and getting mad at me for mistakes, but then I make more mistakes because I'm so stressed (still vague, but narrowing in) and I just know he's going to fire me soon.
> 
> Is he really always coming down on you?  
> 
> Yes.
> 
> So for eight hours a day he just yells at you?
> 
> Well no, not literally the whole 8 hours.  
> 
> And has he said anything nice to you ever?  
> 
> Well yes, he told me I did a great job with project X last week.
> 
> And how often does he come down on you daily?
> 
> I guess I'd say every other day he points out an error that I made.
> 
> And how long has this been going on?  
> 
> Oh for about 5 years.
> 
> And he hasn't fired you yet?
> 
> No, but it's coming, I just know it.
> 
> So if I understand you correctly, **you're saying that when you make mistakes, this causes you a great deal of anxiety because you think you're going to get fired.**  If you did get fired, what would be the consequence of that?
> 
> Of getting fired!?  It would be the end of the world!  I wouldn't be able to feed myself and I'd end up on the streets.
> 
> Have you ever been fired from a job before?
> 
> No, not fired, but I got laid off from a job right before I got this one.
> 
> And how did you avoid becoming homeless?
> 
> I worked my ass off and applied all over the place, it took me about 2 months...


So a couple things are going on over here.  One, we've moved from 'I am miserable and hate my job' to a specific thing that's problematic: the anxiety of making a mistake, which then leads to all sorts of fears about life totally falling apart.  This second thing is called catastrophizing, which is an error in thinking that assumes that the absolute worst thing is going to happen and everything is going to go wrong, despite the fact that the imaginary patient could actually take care of himself.  There's some issues of perception.  The patient says his boss yells at him all the time, but in fact it only happens every so often and he then overgeneralizes these experiences.

This is the kind of stuff that CBT dives into so I'm not going to give it a fuller treatment, but hopefully that's helpful.  Like I said, just start trying to pay attention to what's bothering you over the next week and jot it down.  Your psychologist will help you go from there.",TrontRaznik,8jwhx8

1,"I'll give you some information about things that can help children, then something about CPTSD.  
   
There is evidence that relaxation with the traditional Asian methods can help children with ADHD. Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg, who have published 6 papers on breathing and mental health, recommend a 3-part program of mind-body methods - breathing, meditation, and slow body movement.

I don't have the title of a good book for children, but I'll mention that I always read the Amazon reader reviews carefully, using the filter that shows 5-star, 4-star etc. so I can see what the most intelligent readers say.  
  
ADHD expert and author Dr. Russell Barkley has a number of YouTube videos. You can check Barkley’s impressive credentials at his Wikipedia article.Advocacy and support groups such as CHADD can be helpful.   
  
An excellent author on the subject of CPTSD - Anna Runkle.  
  
It’s important to have a therapist who has experience treating trauma.  
  
I think every victim of childhood trauma should see this -  
  
In this video, author Anna Runkle talks about her study of CPTSD and summarizes treatments shown to help. She says that as a CPTSD survivor, the thing she has found most helpful to her is dealing with the symptom known as dysregulation, which is getting very upset. I would definitely see her videos on dysregulation.

3,"wow thanks for the response. I don't know if I followed your whole argument here, but you are probably onto something. You are right though, the only thing that has actually made a significant difference for me is medication. However, as I'm sure you are well aware, figuring out the right medication presents a whole new set of challenges. Right now I have been prescribed to take Escitalopram (generic lexapro), vitamin D supplement, and Vyvanse. The escitalopram has been very helpful for controlling my emotions, but has probably suppressed other things in my brain as well. I feel more calm and mellow, but don't feel like doing a whole lot. Thus the Vyvanse prescription. Vyvanse is supposed to be like Adderall but with a longer release time and less side effects. The Vyvanse definitely gives me more energy, but makes me feel more anxious and wired 'on'. I'm like a go-go bot and more easily agitated. I have basically stopped taking it, the main reason being its a 12 hour release med, and I usually sleep in and stay up too late, so if I don't get up early enough there is no point in taking it. 

The point is, meds have been a real game changer for me, but still haven't gotten me where I would like to go. And therapy seems like it wouldn't really hurt, but it probably wouldn't help that much either. I realized me and my therapist were just not on the same page because she kept wanting me to identify negative thought patterns and I just couldn't do it. Sure there is probably some stimuli that triggers certain feelings for me, but those items don't explain the depth and complexity of my emotions.",swheatl6,3us2sm

Before I knew this years ago, I was seeing a therapist, and I told her that I was considering seeing someone else who specialized in CBT. She said, ""I do that here too."" Then, hands me a piece of paper that has some sort of CBT assignment on it and tells me to fill that out. I never went back to her. That was no way to properly administer or perform CBT. Thankfully, I was in school to be a psychologist and specializing in psychological assessments and knew she had no idea what she was doing.

22,"They shouldn't just listen. While it is a one sided relationship, a good therapist should be helping arm you with tools to manage whatever it is you are going through so that you can manage it/function healthier. 

If it's the type of thing that has triggers, they help you discover what those are, how to navigate ones you can avoid vs. ones you can't. Or if you are going through something that you notice unhealthy patterns help you develop ways out of those patterns. 

Sometimes finding a therapist is like dating. You might need to go on a few ""intake appointments"" before finding a good match. I usually recommend giving a therapist two or three sessions before deciding to move on (unless it's super obvious right away). It doesn't mean they're not a good therapist, they may not be a good therapist for you.

26,"In the first session you will be doing most of the talking. The therapist has to get to know you, understand you, your patterns, goals, etc. They should ask some open ended questions and reflect your feelings to make sure that they understand you.


However, some therapists will do more as they go. 

Cognitive behavioral therapy seeks to help you understand your behavior and form new ones.

Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy looks to identify irrational behaviors and beliefs and replace them with positive and rational ones.

Gestalt therapy focuses on the now and uses different techniques.

It should be a conversation with your therapist. Ask about their methods and how they work.

If this therapist isn’t for you, ask for a referral. Part of the code of conduct means they should give that referral without any problem.

If you are not good at organizing your thoughts or figuring out your 'whys' as to why something is bothering you, or why you're feeling the way you are, therapists are often good\* at helping you figure out your own emotions and thoughts.   


Imo, therapists are less ideal for getting concrete advice on how to proceed with objective issues.  They're only humans with certificates, after all.

30,"Hello, pre-licensed therapist here! 

I highly recommend reading articles by Dr. Jonathan Shedler, a psychodynamic clinician and researcher who has studied the efficacy of psychotherapy for decades. Good therapy facilitates growth in your own sense of autonomy & does not work as an advice-dispenser. Therapy is meant to be an exploratory relationship for you to figure out what works best for you as a unique individual, & no therapist can make that designation for you because they are not you! Good therapy allows you to see how your past is still playing out in the present, what patterns you are still enacting, what you are projecting onto your current relationships, including onto your therapist. Good therapy assists you in exploring what lies below the surface of everyday consciousness, reworking your character structure, personality, & ways of being to better adapt to & evolve with your circumstances. It is difficult to examine long-held assumptions & blindspots without a person (therapist) holding up a mirror to you. 

Unfortunately, many therapists are not trained very well and tend to coddle clients with validation. However, as you may have noticed, just listening & providing validation does not generate any long term change & enables clients to continue to behave in self-defeating ways. Good therapy is gentle but challenging, oriented towards honesty, truthfulness, & the client’s best interests (that is, always in service to their stated goals). Therapists are meant to be active participants, offering observations, connections, hypotheses, reframes, & psychological knowledge when clinically appropriate. Meaning-making and healing occur in the context of relationships & therapy is meant to provide a safe relationship devoted to your personal growth and self-understanding. 

Also, different therapists adhere to different treatment modalities & theoretical orientations; some are more skills-based (CBT, DBT, ACT), incorporating mindfulness/grounding exercises and “homework” to practice cognitive restructuring. As someone else mentioned here, you may be more interested in a solutions-focused framework which I find is less about emotional regulation & internal shifts in perspective & more about finding and implementing practical solutions. The idea is to focus on exceptions (times when you aren’t struggling) and on little wins/positive movement and momentum towards your goals. It’s a bit more like coaching. The reason I personally don’t love this approach is that most people are stuck due to internal conflicts & not just due to lack of ideas for solving external problems. This is why psychodynamic therapy appeals to me, as it focuses on addressing the underlying roots of suffering rather than its symptoms.

My third therapist is the best one I’ve had yet; it takes time to find the right fit and approach. Hope you still have some faith in the process — therapy can be an invaluable support for personal transformation and can enhance a sense of intimacy with self and others. I am extremely grateful for the care, kindness, curiosity, non-judgment, acceptance, validation, exploration, new perspectives, connections, & insights I have gained and received in therapy.",Timely_Resist5656,1bgdbi0
31,"they don’t all just listen. therapists are also supposed to offer advice in response to what u tell them. i’m gonna be real with u. it took me YEARS to find a good therapist. like 6-7 years. but i kept going and it ended up being worth it to me because i found someone who helped me turn things around more than i ever thought i’d be able to. so no, it’s not pointless, so long as u are willing to not give up on it the second things don’t turn out perfectly",pentichan,1bgdbi0
32,"Generally speaking, the therapist can start taking a more active role once they get to know you better and begin to understand the way you think. This takes some time - first session is mostly an assessment.

This is necessary, as you'd receive rather generic advice that doesn't fully match your situation or misses an (emotional) aspect that is important to you, which can be very frustrating or anger inducing as a patient.

Do also communicate to the therapist what you expect from them and how you'd like to approch things. This kind of communication is very important - do also tell them if they said something that you deem inappropriate/offensive/hurtful or that misses your point.

Most importantly, the chemistry between the two of you needs to good, such that a relationship of trust can be formed and it becomes easier for you to open up. If you can't stand them or vice versa, seeking someone else is recommended.",kiffmet,1bgdbi0

Besides, it’s critical to revisit your past to process it from a different perspective, especially since your brain is (presumably) now fully developed.

75,"I've had multiple therapists with different kinds of therapies. I'm talking about 11 or 12. Only three of them have had a true impact in my mental health. 

I had a social worker in high scholl was very kind, understanding and helpful. Although my mental health was in decline, he was one of the first people to point me to the right resources for my mental health. He would listen to me once a week. He was very non judgemental and I enjoyed just having casual conversations with him. He would help me in academics and mental health. He was very dedicated to his profession as a social worker. He is the only person in that high school who is worthy of recognition. I'm not the only one who says that. Many agree on that, parents and other students. Hope his life is full blessings and prosperity. The other two were therapists. 

One of them was a Cognitive Behavioral therapist, and she was great. She helped me overcome my anxiety to silence in social situations. We did multiple exercises for mindfulness and a sort of imagination therapy. It became so so useful to me, that even know I still use when feeling on edge, event though it's been more than 5 years since.

The other therapist was a guy who truly loved his job. He worked at a teen outpatient facility. He would do groups and individual therapist. I trusted him with my most embarrassing mental secrets and he helped me changed the vision of life I had for me. I was broken beyond repair. I had a very twisted image of who I was. I thought I only deserved to die a painful death. But he never gave up on me and managed to get me studying back in high school, despite my psychiatrist and the school opposing. They wanted me to go straight for GED, but my therapist knew that's not what I wanted, and he fought hard to get me in. He advocated for me a lot. He was my hero. I've never seen him again, but now that I'm about to graduate with a Bachelor's degree, I want to go to his private practice and give him a gift or flowers or something like that. He deserves all recognition. He is a angel in flesh and bone.

However, I have had therapists and psychiatrists thst were very dispoointing or just not useful for my case. I had a psychiatrist that recommend me to look for girls and have sex to control my depression. I also had therapists who would yawn and just listen to me. But it wasn't better than talking to a wall. There were no real action plans, no exercises, no advancement, nothing. Psychology is definitely not for everyone.

However, my last psychiatrists have been awesome. Very enjoyable to be their patients. I love their dedication and their willingness to work with patients to find the best treatment. Above all, I liked that both of them knew how to hold me accountable for my lack of commitment to treatment in a way that was respectful, motivational and encouraging.

Don’t feel pressured to schedule anything with them right away and meet with 3-5 other therapists first.

There are many mental health treatment techniques out there, and not all of them are the right ones for you. Frankly, finding a therapist is half the battle. There are so many different techniques, and it is so personal, it's hard to know for sure which one is really best for you before trying.

You can try CBT, DBT, EMDR, NARM, and various non-talk therapies. For each their own, and I will be the last person to judge you. It often takes more than one therapist until you find the right one.

My personal experience with therapy over the last few years was transformative, probably in more ways than I know. I can process my emotions, I can deal with difficult situations, I can deal with stressors and so much more.

There are many other things that changed for the better. Worth every penny.

Some are there to listen, and work through your issues. others provide specific coping skills based on your diagnosis. trauma therapists help work through/process the event, as well as dealing with PTSD symptoms. ED therapists help working through fears around food, and de building that ED mindset.

97,"No, no, no.  All *you* do is listen... to yourself.  The therapist serves as more of a facilitator than someone with whom you're having a conversation, helping you learn more about yourself.

Well, that's one role.  Others include teaching you about your diagnoses, maybe a little bit of the neurology and psychology behind what you're experiencing, etc., as well as modeling how you should treat yourself and/or expect others to treat you (research Carl Rogers' person-centered therapy, as well as feminist therapy).

But it's important to note there are many types of therapy and many therapists who all do things differently.  Some are very structured, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, whereas others are really loose, such as person-centered, where the relationship with the counselor itself is designed to facilitate the healing, so what you do in sessions isn't as important as the fact you're doing it.

Also, most therapists use some combination of those, adjusting it based on the client, as each one is optimal for certain situations and personality types.

If you want my advice, try one or two more sessions, and if you still feel the same way, talk to your therapist about whether there are any other modalities you could try or if you could be referred.  But it sounds like you're looking for something more structured, like CBT, DBT, ACT, or the like.

Don't give up on therapy: there are so many types out there that you haven't tried.",Terrible-Trust-5578,1bgdbi0
98,"It really just depends on the type of therapy that you're after. 

My therapist does talk therapy and EMDR therapy, and I have found them extremely healing. The talk therapy is essentially me using her as a sounding board so I can (essentially) talk out my own problems whilst having validation and an alternative perspective if I need it (I am quite self aware but often just need to talk things out as a means of processing them). Then the EMDR is actually going into different memories and rewiring the way I perceive those memories, so they then don't affect me in my current life.

If you're looking for more solutions based therapy, find a solutions based therapist, you are allowed to find a therapist that works for you, if you can try to find out what each therapists philosophy is before committing to seeing them regularly. Ideally before going into therapy, you'll want to have a list of things you want to work on (memories, habits, behaviours, traumas etc) as well as what you are looking to get out of therapy. The best way to get what you want out of therapy is to present your list of things and say, is this something that you would be qualified to work with me through? And if they say yes, perfect! If they say ""no, I do more talk based therapy,"" then you can move on and just look for someone else. 

At the end of the day the relationship that you have with your therapist is one of the most important relationships when it comes to your own personal healing journey, it's okay to find the perfect person who you feel will be able to help you along that journey.",-iamu-urme-,1bgdbi0

Therapy is pointless IF the therapist is unskilled or they aren't a good match for you. Most aren't, unfortunately. You may have to change a few psychotherapists to find your perfect match.

110,"Depends on you and the therapist imo.

At the beginning of my adventures where I live now... I actually was talked/forced into checking myself into the hospital and from there was committed and given a therapist and basically forced (less you wanna go back to the hospital again) to talk to someone or get white sheeted.

I had three therapists at the center the hospital referred me to. The first one, Josh? Oh my goodness, I loved him. He was a younger therapist, but he knew all the right things to say and was almost like a friend, but we had our boundaries. Josh sent me to the hospital a lot. At the end... he told me that if I were to attempt unaliving myself again... that I would have to work with someone else, and that's how I got Jim. 

Jim was an ass. He wanted to talk about his board of words and all these left field feeling things. When I told him that I wanted/was hurting myself at the time... he suggested that I bake. I walked out of my last session with Jim and ended up speaking to a supervisor and everything. They ended up holding me in their transitional housing in the back (big community outreach center) and held me for 3 days until they all realised that I wasn't gonna work with Jim and that you can't force DBT therapy on people. 

I ended up with my last therapist there, a LOVELY man named Brent who had been trained in DBT therapy but switched to CBT. They all thought it was the next big thing, and they were right.

Brent... this sweet, sweet man once was on a phone call with me at 1am while I was actively trying to end my life, and because of him, I'm still alive. He ended up meeting my Mom (by phone), and my brother came in a couple of times when I was seeing him in person even. Sadly I lost the insurance I had and had to stop seeing him... but he literally still messages me once a week to check in.

119,"Well, it is their job to listen, but they are also supposed to give constructive feedback and provide you with coping skills and help deconstruct negative thought patterns. It took me at least 3-5 therapists before I found one that clicked for me. It’s very much a matter of finding the right therapist for you. With the right therapist, therapy should feel like somewhere you can go and rant/vent about anything and everything. Somewhere where you can let everything out without judgement. It depends on each individual of course, and therapy is different for everyone. What therapy is for me may not be what therapy is for you or someone else. Also keep in mind that it takes a few sessions to figure out if the therapist is a good fit. I always give a new therapist 2-5 sessions to start off with, and if I’m still not feeling like it’s a good fit after those sessions, I go to someone else. Unfortunately, the first therapist that you go to see isn’t always going to be the right fit. And for that matter, neither is the second or third sometimes. Stick with it, once you find the right therapist, it is worth every cent. I think about it this way: how many people do we have in our personal lives, friends or family, that can listen to us rant/vent without being biased? How many people in our day to day lives can offer a neutral opinion without any emotional persuasion? Usually minimal to none. A therapist can really help see things from another perspective.

I probably could have found the same exercises with a quick google search. It didn't really seem at that helpful. I cancelled my subscription after the first month. 

Later I tried in person therapy. I went for about 6 months until they cut it off. Again the therapist didn't know anything about ASD despite me claiming that was the reason I came in. And again because I mentioned anxiety at some point they left me with some exercises that are supposed to help with that. It didn't really feel all that helpful. I was given exercises that I felt didn't help much or solve my problems. I felt like I didn't fully understand all my struggles and problems.

136,"Unfortunately there is a reason the can't give advice, it's because they are heavily trained not to. Not only can advice be kind of damaging because it's not actually teaching you anything, just telling you what to do, it can also just be the therapists own biased opinion due to their own experiences and not totally fit you. Plus the idea of just ""getting advice"" makes people think mental health should be a quick fix... ""I'll just get some advice, follow it, and everything will be ok"" (not saying you think that, but they are trained to avoid it due to those who do) 

But the biggest reason they are trained not to? They give advice, the person goes away and they can misinterpret that advice, or even follow it to the letter and everything goes to hell. Now, not only is that therapist now in huge trouble, they have ruined future trust in therapy for their client. It's the therapist equivalent of malpractice.

But that's not what clients want to hear. They feel like everything is a mess, they have tried everything, now they just want to be told what to do to fix it.

In training, many therapists are taught advice giving is a cardinal sin, but often are not properly trained in alternatives, so they just end up listening because that's safer. 

Don't get me wrong, listening is often a really good strategy. Sometimes talking things out loud allows you to finally see a bigger picture after drowning in the details for so long, or a puzzle piece will finally slip into place to help make sense of a problem. But that doesn't work for everyone.

The biggest thing people need to remember is... There is more than one kind of therapy and there is more than one therapist. One kind of therapy might not work for you, and you're entitled to try other types. One therapist might not work for you either. They are still people and you won't get along with everyone. Shop around. Why keep taking your Toyota to the mechanic who only services Fords?

Every therapist is going to be biased towards their own trained type. Myself, I always advocate for narrative therapy because it's really about digging out those ideas, perspectives, and personalised approaches for redesigning your life. But it's better if you do a little research about different types to see what you like, not what they recommend.

Advice in therapy tends to be ""you should do this"" which suggests an answer and leaves you feeling bad if it doesn't work. A good therapist can find ways around advice giving by laying out options and ideas, helping you brainstorm things that might fit you, and then being a springboard as you piece together the best strategy to try, while leaving room to come back and tackle it from a new angle if the previous one didn't work.  

And like any good relationship, communication is key. You'll never know unless you ask. Some therapists are willing to be adaptive and come to the table if you ask to help hash over ideas. And if they aren't, well you can stop wasting time.

I'm not sure if this helps at all but... you know, it could be a few ideas to consider. It's really about finding what is going to fit you.",becauseshesaidso,1bgdbi0

159,A lot of therapists have either suffered from mental illness or have been surrounded by mental illness growing up. The wounded healer archetype is very prevalent in this field. I am sorry you have had such unhelpful experiences with mental health professionals to have caused you to see therapy as mere self-masturbation.. Bad therapy leads nowhere and perpetuates the clients’ maladaptive ways of interacting with the world. Good therapy can lead to incredible breakthroughs in self understanding & genuine long-lasting change that compounds over time. There is plenty of research to demonstrate the efficacy of psychotherapy across modalities compared to control groups (who don’t have exposure to therapeutic interventions of any kind).,Timely_Resist5656,1bgdbi0

Therapists shouldn’t give you advice (because that is inherently based on their thoughts, beliefs, and experiences) but rather help you come to the ‘advice’ on your own by asking you questions and not jumping in with judgment (e.g., “that’s great”, “It’s not good”) about whatever you are contemplating.

It takes at least a few sessions to get the vibe of who you’re working with, both as the therapist and the individual seeking therapy. If my therapist was offering “advice” on the first session I would feel very off-put given they don’t yet know me.

176,"Therapist here: there's a difference between validation and accountability. It sounds like you want accountability.  

A therapist teeters on a line, a like that could snap at any second with a misstep. 

You can't have accountability without a fair amount of validation. ""I totally see why you did what you did, but I want to point out something that concerns me."" Vs ""next time you're fighting handle your anger by doing XYZ."" (Not going to go over well)

Also, without established trust a client confronted (too hard or too quickly) on a problematic behavior will end up becoming defensive and end up leaving. 



I've had clients ask for accountability, and then shut down completely as soon as I bring up an issue. It is a huge risk for the relationship. That's what you're really paying for with therapy, the relationship. 

But, correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're not really worried about the relationship and just want facts.
If that's true, ask some polls from people on here so you can do a little research as well as watch some YouTube and see if you can do your own behavioral modifications.

I like to think that in therapy, a therapist validates the clients experience -feelings, thoughts, actions or even just you as a person. Therapy is a place for reflection of why you may be the way you are. Then a therapist can challenge you to change/ think about how to reframe thoughts or approaches on life to get you to where the client wants to be.

193,"Yeah! First, Psychedelics aren't going to be for everyone, because sometimes there's some underlying health conditions like Type 1 bipolar, schizophrenia, narcissism, heart issues, and anyone with delusions can't take them because it can worsen their issues.

Used correctly, they can do a lot for people.  The medical trials are very positive so far. For people who have anxiety or severe trauma, they should look into MDMA therapy because it deactivates the Amygdala, which is the fear center of the brain. I've never tried MDMA.

I've done ketamine therapy (the one where you go into a doctor's office and get an IV) and psilocybin mushrooms, and both have been really positive for me working through my shit... But note I use these in addition to inputting other 'work' in my life.... I have a full writeup on my discord about my trip day protocol (it's a full day of busting your ass and crushing a to do list), and I go into detail about what kind of 'work' you can put into your life to prep for trip days. Disciplined sleeping habits, really taking your living space as a serious project, decorating, therapy, exercising (even if it's walking and walking paths you don't normally go on foot), building an ideal trip music list, etc.

I have a trip day once every 2 or 3 weeks with a moderate dose. Most of the time they are amazing and I feel great about myself... Proud, accomplished, and motivated. They are heaven normally.... But....

Last night's didn't go so well. Some would say ""it was a bad trip,"" but I think it was just some underlying happenings over the past 2 weeks that were just floating in my head that caused me to be insecure and self critical. 

The great news is that even the ""bad trips"" are good ones, but I believe it's the way of how I've approached my relationship with Psychedelics as tools. Starting slow by starting with a low dose to understand what to expect and learn how things can sometimes be emotional or hard is very important. 

I had a difficult time calming myself down for some reason yesterday, and couldn't take it easy on myself about how I kinda ""fucked off"" this week professionally. It turned into me giving myself a pep talk about how I need to course correct for the future, because I just don't want to feel unsuccessful in what I'm doing.... Right now I feel a bit of that because I've slowed down my hours a lot just to do this podcast and work on this project.... So there's money stress built in here.

What I'm proud of is how I navigated a ""bad one."" I was able to recognize what was going on because of my knowledge, research and experience, and ""feed myself"" a lot of things I've learned from therapy or other good, supportive people who care about me. Then when I got out of the shower, I walked out to my place that was pristinely clean and the lighting was already set exactly how I wanted it... God, it was nice to say ""well, at least when I open this door I did something right today... Along with 26 other items I crossed off my to do list.""

- I complained about my problematic relationship with my mother, no tips received 
- I complained about very poor memory and concentration problems that were impacting my everyday life severely - ""online there are courses, but they are expensive"" 
- I complained about my social anxieties that come and go randomly but when they are there, they socially impair me a lot - ""go out more to confront your fears"" - it worked quite well, I am still anxious af but a bit less avoidant. 
- I had 2 INSANE flashbacks about being r...ed, ive had flashbacks before but never as strong as back then and was DESPERATE for help - ""can't help you here"" 
- my past relationship which wounded me a lot and traumatized me - I don't recall receiving any tips on it 
- the fact I feel like I'm a weird alien and socially incapable - we did the 4 ears model and how to recognize if someone is aggressive, intimidated or assertive. The first one was very useful for the future, the second I didn't need at all because I don't struggle with recognizing these. But that was all. 


After 2 years I learned that I need to confront my fears if I don't want to do smfh because of them and how to communicate in a healthy way - these things were learnt in 2 separate sittings.

198,"There are a lot of different frameworks that therapists operate from but most should actually help you process the past. We all have internalized negative beliefs and shit about ourselves which we see and interact with the world through. These beliefs can then cause all kinds of dysfunctional behaviors and relationships so it's your therapist's job to help you recognize those beliefs and where they came from and challenge/process them. Over time the goal is to shift those negative beliefs into more adaptive, functional beliefs. So if you're an anxious person functioning from beliefs like, ""I'm not safe,"" or ""I can't do this,"" your therapist should help you identify that and connect to more adaptive beliefs like, ""I can trust myself,"" or ""I can handle this.""

Your brain creates these new neural pathways and you start to see the world through this new lens so your anxiety symptoms decrease. A lot of trauma-informed/trauma-focused modalities lead to these results even if you don't have a trauma history (EMDR, IFS, Somatic Experiencing, etc.).",omglookawhale,1bgdbi0

If your depression is more deep seated then CBT won't help you.

CBT has its uses but it's coping strategies and leaning to distract yourself.  If you want deeper level then find a counselling service that offers more than CBT.

Look for someone who can work with your past (psychodynamic, or like me HE)  we can help you understand things that you may not even know are there. We take huge amounts of stuff from childhood that affect us as adults without us realising. Not just trauma - ordinary, everyday normal stuff that can cause just as much depression and anxiety.

11,"Hi, jumping into this thread here because I also have a habit of not being able to open up about my issues. Something that's helped me is writing it down. Write a letter detailing everything you want a therapist or counsellor to know, explain that you don't know how to open up about these things even, and let them read it instead of relying on going into a session and plucking up the courage to say something which you never manage to say. Walk into your session holding this letter, or if it's online try to make it apparent some way just in case you can't even bring yourself to hand it to them. Someone who's good at their job will prompt you to talk more about this stuff because it's been made obvious that it's what you need help with. As for opening up past that, it's uncomfortable. It can make you feel very vulnerable or embarrassed or it can open you up to some feelings that you've kept bottled up for some time, but you won't be telling anybody anything that isn't in your best interest to tell them.

12,"I wish I had known growing up that counseling and medications also don't account for dietary, gut health, and nutritional factors. Biological contributions to mental illness are often overlooked by both the psychological/psychiatric and medical communities.

For example, the nutrient zinc is a natural mood stabilizer that helps with resilience to stress. It can get depleted over periods of high stress (along with vitamin B6 and vitamin C) and actually can help induce a mental health issue in some people. And this is just an example; there are many more, like low levels of vitamin D being found in many people who feel suicidal.

And unknown food allergies can create nutritional deficiencies if the irritation ends up causing inflammatory wear and tear in the digestive system. I found a case study in which a child with autism went into remission after finding a) a food allergy and b) several nutritional deficiencies. Addressing those things led to a recovery.

I'm not saying that this is the issue by any means, or even part of the issue, but what are your thoughts on looking down the food allergy/nutrient deficiency route?",,jh9t2o

I'm not saying don't do it, as it might be the ice breaker you need.  I have clients that come for a few sessions then have a break then come back months later to complete. 

You could try some basic self help like journaling first. If you can write stuff down first sometimes it becomes easier to speak out loud.

2,"As has been pointed out, a psychiatrist will be more interested in obtaining diagnosis and prescribing medication. They usually do little more than ask about symptoms and dole out meds, they won't do counseling. Psychologists/therapists are often offered alongside medication because their goal is primarily to support you to manage your symptoms in different ways, as well as provide an array of treatments depending on their approach and your needs. CBT is one that is very commonly offered.


As with all treatment, what you get out of it is directly related to how much you give. I've had CBT at various points in my life, and it only works if you're willing to do the work. It's also not always the best approach for every person, but can certainly provide some tools and skills that will help you become more aware of destructive thought patterns and potentially how to change how you manage them. 


It depends what you want out of therapy I suppose, this is something you can and should discuss when you get to the appointment. If the University is offering free counselling it's certainly worth going and seeing if what's on offer will work. If it doesn't feel right after a few sessions you can try another service.

3,"Hey everything pretty much covered here. It is necessary to point out though that going to the University counseling services you're likely to have one or more of the following:

1. Instead of a psy.d or ph.d talking to you, you'll likely be working with someone actively pursuing a degree at a master's or doctoral level. 

2. You may have a recording device in the office. Now, before you freak out, note that laws still have to be followrd like Hippa so people aren't just listening to you. It's actually to make sure the counselor is doing their job, and not causing harm. (I.e. asking for more than needed to satisfy their curiosity). 

3. Wait times can be long. I went to a university with 40,000+ students. If you're late or trying to make an appointment tomorrow,  you can pretty much forget about it. Though many schools have a separate emergency psych. Services that you can go to in these cases. But again there will likely be a wait, which if you're super anxious or depressed probably wont help, but stick through it. 

It's important to know what you're going into, and i hope this gives you a good idea. Take advantage of the counseling and research the psychiatrists. I try to see only psychiatrists that have degrees based on anxiety and depression as that is what i have and psychiatrists, just like anyone else, have a tendency to find what they specialize in. That or figure out which psychiatrist is chief and go to them, they'll move you to the right one if necessary, but dont expect this after 10 sessions many colleges and practices dont like moving a patient to other internal doctors. 

Finally see if there are any EA (emotions anonymous) or BDSA (bipolar depresssion support alliance) meetings near you. They will be fully anonymous, you cant vent and recieve support. Plus youll see that others have trouble with what you're going through too, and you may meet people socially (just remember they are there for help too)",smishmortion,6onaa4
4,"* A psychiatrist's job is to prescribe medication.  They generally don't do CBT.

* A psychologist is essentially a gussied-up therapist.  They are more likely to provide CBT than a psychiatrist, but cannot prescribe medication.

* With university-provided therapy services, odds are you're going to get students, not psychologists, psychiatrists, or even licensed social workers.  They will have some form of supervision by *someone else* who has a license, but they won't have one themselves, and that licensed and experienced practitioner almost certainly won't be in the room with you.  

If you're specifically seeking out CBT and can afford it, I would go with a psychologist and not through the university.  When done poorly, CBT can be awful and damaging.  My experiences with it in the past, even with experienced practitioners, amounted to them telling me I was too stupid to know what I was ""really"" thinking, even after I demonstrated, time and time again, that I actually had a pretty good grasp on what I was going through and that my fears and predictions were usually right.  

My experience with CBT is no guarantee that you will experience anything similar, of course, but I'd still recommend going with someone who actually knows what they're doing, as opposed to someone who doesn't have a degree yet.  If you can't afford a psychologist, then going through the university is your only choice and you'll have to do what you can with what you've got.

Good luck.",,6onaa4

There are some really informed posts below. All that I can add is that the outcome (ie whether you feel better or not) probably wont be related to the qualifications of the therapist. (I have a long list of them, so I do understand the various differences.) 
What makes a difefrences is if you can develop a positive relationship with the person and agree a focus for the work that you then make progress on. Its really hard to predict this in advance, but provided that the people have the basics on paper, it is this that  
probably matters most. In a nutshell, if you click with the person, stick with it!

7,"Asking them about it would probably be a good idea. Because they should have a psychologist/-iatrist who oversees the clinic (and is probably a professor of psychology, too). So, there might be more overlap in that situation than if you were to see a private outpatient counseling center that doesn't have a psych doctor on staff. The university might also have a psychology clinic where the psych. PhD students do their clinical practicums.

In general, the difference between a psychologist and psychiatrist is the first cannot rx meds and would prefer to use cbt or other methods to treat, the latter can rx meds and that's their primary treatment modality. Which is why psychiatrists often suggest also seeing a counselor and a psychologist will have you go see your normal doctor asking for psychiatric medications.

Technically, all three (CSW, PhD, MD/DO) can diagnose, but it's primarily done by the doctors and theirs tend to hold more weight.",cnz4567890,6onaa4

 I understand they can all do CBT - but do you think there is any additional benefit to a psychologist over an LPC or LCSW?

0,"You don't tell us exactly what went on in your CBT, but it seems, based on what I've seen here, that many therapists are emphasizing the thinking part of CBT at the expense of the B for behavioral in CBT.

In his self-help book, therapist/researcher Stephen Ilardi, who developed a lifestyle-depression program at this university, the author gives a brief history of CBT and tells us how behavior change was added to cognitive therapy because of a treatment called Behavior Activation, a therapy that showed in the clinical studies that these changes help people to avoid negative thinking even when they are not told to do this.

The research prompted Ilardi to review all pertinent research on lifestyle and moods. His team identified 6 key factors.

If you go to Metapsychology, you can read a psychologist's review of Dr. Steve Ilardi's book (""a splendid book""). 

Relaxation eases the symptoms of depression.

The easiest way to calm down is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min in the early morning and at bedtime is a therapy. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently through the nose, 6 seconds each.

A good habit - respond to moments of stress by breathing slowly.

Free group therapy - go to the site of Recovery International. They have books and meetings, local and online. They've been helping people for generations.

When we're depressed, motivation for our chores and self-care can be very helpful. It gives us confidence. Activity, especially physical activity, is a kind of therapy. That's not all there is to getting over depression, but it can be very important.

Practical advice for motivation - VERY important -

0,"You probably will not find a psychiatrist that does CBT. Mostly because of a shortage of psychiatrists, you only see them once every 3 to 6 months... often for less than 20 mins. Also you don't need a psychologist to do CBT, any type of counselor/therapist/social worker (with mental health specialty) can do that. The psychologist will be able to provide other services, the others might not be able to (but will also cost substantially more, and be harder to get an appointment with, there's a shortage of them as well).

The cheapest, fastest way to get medical evaluation/psychiatric medications and do CBT would be to find a community counseling center (or something similar) for the CBT and go see your normal doctor for the medical/prescriptions. Your primary care doctor might refer you out to a psychiatrist, or might be able to handle your situation with their training/experience. Going to a psychiatrist and psychologist would be the most expensive, slowest way of going about it... but possibly with much better returns due to their specializing in the subjects, training, and experience. You might have to shop around a bit to find psych docs that aren't requiring a referral, and even then, you might be put on a 6+ month wait list. Whereas the counselor/therapist should be able to get you in within 2 weeks and your normal doctor should be available within a few days.

3,"> an I bring up the idea to my regular doctor about me possibly getting tested for ADHD as well?

You can. Like you mentioned, it might not be fruitful, but he might know enough about psychiatry to do a quick rundown and see if you seem to meet the criteria. Also you might want to see him before trying to find a psychiatrist... but not necessarily a psychologist. If he decides to refer you to a psychiatric/neurological doctor it will likely be a psychiatrist (and thus you calling around wouldn't be terribly useful). It's highly unlikely he would refer you to a psychologist, however. So, if you're eventually wanting a psychologist to do your treatment from the therapeutic viewpoint; calling around to those offices might be helpful. And then possibly get a referral for the medical side (psychiatrist), but if he doesn't refer you to one, you could then start searching.

2,"My worst therapy experience was with someone who tried to kinda 'force' my wall down in the first visit with him rather than letting me get comfortable. He said something like, why are you coming to therapy? I explained that I had a few mental health diagnosis' and my old therapist was switching from private practice to working for a school so I needed a new therapist. He asked me what some things I want to work on are, and I froze and said I couldn't think of anything. He then said ""So there's nothing you can think of that you want to fix? I can't see why you'd come to therapy then!"" which made me feel really anxious like he was accusing me of not having ""problems"". I wasn't trying to imply that nothing is 'wrong' with me, I just couldn't think of anything when put on the spot. I was so anxious/upset that I was trying not to cry and just sitting there silently. I was 17, he asked what my grades were like and I told him I got good grades. He asked if I had ever been in legal trouble, I said no. He basically repeated himself saying something like ""Sounds like you don't need therapy!""

I was SO uncomfortable, it felt so aggressive and just made me freeze even more. We sat in silent for a while, I desperately wanted to leave but was too anxious to do so. He eventually started telling me that he likes snowmobiling and telling me more about himself but I was basically just saying 'oh, okay, yep, uh-huh"" until the time was up and I got out of there and never went back. And then was afraid of trying a new therapist for many years.

Another thing that I personally dislike is when therapists just stare and sit in silence. I've read somewhere that it's some technique taught to them but it gives me significant anxiety and makes me uncomfortable with them, reduces my interest in seeing them when I associate being deeply uncomfortable in session.

The two therapists that I've had that I stuck with longterm, just made me feel really comfortable basically. It's hard to pinpoint exactly how they did that. I know one thing my current therapist has done to facilitate that is to specifically tell me in advance that it's okay if she suggests something (like a grounding exercise for anxiety) and I try it and it doesn't work. With some therapists, it feels like they want to give you a tool and then expect it to definitely work for you and I feel like I'm supposed to pretend it's helping even if it isn't. So I love that my current therapist recognizes that not everything works for everyone, and makes it clear that it's okay to admit that. That she'd rather know that a technique isn't for me vs have me pretend it works just to avoid ""disappointing"" her. She wants to know how it's actually going rather than just have me say that her suggestion helped or that I'm better now if that isn't really the case. I also really like that she doesn't push me too hard. If I say I'm feeling really anxious in the middle of a conversation or if she can just sense it, she will remind me that if it's too intense we can talk about something else and go back to this another day.

Edit to add - I saw other people say they hate when their therapists discuss their problems. I can see that being an issue if they talk about it too much and it like takes over my time. But personally, I LOVE when my therapist self-discloses a little bit. It makes me feel like I know them a tiny bit rather than it being a 100% one sided relationship. Like I appreciate knowing that my therapist shares a diagnosis I have, and that they have a partner who has a diagnosis I have also. She doesn't go on and on about it, but the fact that she admitted those things to me helped me to realize that she truly 'gets it'.",Emmylu91,18g8qo7

12,"I've been a clinical social worker for 28 years and I suppose I could fill a book full of answers to your question.

I would like to suggest a book. The gift of therapy by Irvin Yalom. It's a book I have read and rewrite the number of times and I would recommend it to anyone in this profession. 

It's important to have a sense of humility, a recognition that that I asked the clinical person aren't really any different from the people I meet with. We all have issues of some kind we all struggle with something every now and then and we'll make mistakes.. hopefully we'll learn from them. Sometimes I see clients repeating the same circle over and over again and helping them learn enough and build enough skill to break out of that circle really helps.

I like that you're asking the right questions. How do I want to do this? What's right and what's wrong? And how can I help all those people on my appointment calendar.

Here's a few suggestions to help you start your journey

Try to understand what it's like from your client's point of view. 

When in doubt, listen. 

Be careful of your ego. If you don't have one you'll never feel comfortable in your own skin. And if your ego grows too strong it will delude you into thinking you know everything, and you'll stop listening to everyone. 

Never stop learning, you never know when that knowledge is going to come in handy.

All the classes, the books, the lectures, and all the internships qualify you for your first 5 minutes of every session. After that, it's all you.  

As you continue to work in this field you will develop your own style, you'll make mistakes and if you're smart enough you'll learn from them.

Talk therapy is a collaboration between a professional and a person seeking assistance.  

And most of all, learn how to be very good at taking care of your mental and physical needs. That will help you deal with the stress of the career you've chosen. And we'll also help you stay away from burnout. 

Try to surround yourself with other mentors and professionals who can help you on your journey, bounce ideas off of, and talk about all the things we deal with everyday

15,"For me the worst has been when a therapist is dismissive about a subject or clearly doesn’t want to talk about it but won’t come out and say that and tell me why. It makes me feel ashamed like I’ve done something wrong by bringing up an inappropriate subject, and frustrated because I can’t work on what I want to work on and I don’t know why.

I actually like being told that I am doing something wrong or if my feelings about something might need to be reevaluated.

Best: actively listening and acknowledging my perspective. Even if you disagree with me, just listening and accepting that’s what I believe or understand is very validating.

I’m fortunate that my current therapist is patient and open to ideas that I want to try even if it doesn’t work or if it’s not standard practice. I told her how helpful mindfulness has been for me and she said that she doesn’t consider that an effective technique from her experience but accepted that if it works for me it’s worth doing it.",ShutterBug1988,18g8qo7
26,"I hope I'm not too late to contribute.

I dislike when therapists are so legalistic that they wind up hurting rather than helping. Due to some unique issues I have, I typically fall into the exception category. This isn't just in therapy, in general I have unique and specific needs to navigate life. This almost never matters and is almost never an issue. The only issue is when therapists (this isn't unique to therapists) will not engage with me based on their own ideas and legalistic views. For example, because I have some non-verbality issues, I sometimes have to communicate entirely through text. There is no ""changing the mindset."" I physically cannot speak. Sometimes therapist's think they know better and will not listen. It's frustrating. Being an exception *sucks.*

30,"So you definitely want to avoid exclusively doing CBT. It does not work very well for a lot of people, and to my knowledge, doesn’t have that much of a lasting impact compared to other psychotherapeutic methods like psychodynamic or  I think DBT. Watch for cues in your patients, try and understand what makes them tick, what pieces make up their perceptions, beliefs, memories, and emotional reactions. Now I know this sounds devious and calculating, but it doesn’t have to be. Use it as a methodology to help understand your patients better. 

It’s critically important that you remain as unjudgemental as possible. Every mind is a series of moving parts, angry ideas being expressed in regards to the patient, or any kind of invalidation the patient takes in will have an impact. You don’t have to be perfect, but remember that there is always a reason for their behaviour, be accepting of those difficulties they have. I know that this helps me maintain my empathy when I’m struggling to hold myself together.

31,"Any therapist who begins a session by just asking “ what would you like to talk about today?” always rubbed me the wrong way for some reason. It’s direct which is good- but it just seems so impersonal, overly professional, and cold. I always found therapy more useful when it’s guided gently and starts with a simple question like “how are you?” 
Similarly, if my therapist responds to a story with “oh no!” or “wow I’m sorry” and THEN asks “ how does that make you feel?” it seems genuine. Almost like those small reactions validate feelings and it feels like a friend. It opens the door to my brain gently, if that makes sense. 
After a few sessions however, after a reputation has been built, it would be ok to just jump right in and say “what do you want to talk about?” but it should begin slowly, in my opinion.",MayaNeedsMuse,18g8qo7

34,"This is a tricky question because different clients want different things. I need a therapist that pushes me to open up. I won't do it on my own, no matter how much time we spend rapport building. I need to be challenged. Whereas that will probably make other clients feel very uncomfortable, it makes me feel safe, because I feel like I have permission to talk about it if someone is asking me directly.

My last therapist was okay but one thing that really irked me a lot was how much she focused on intellectualizing things. Historically, I've done better with therapists who did the opposite and helped me to feel my emotions instead of thinking them. So it was really frustrating to feel like I was walking into a therapy session and being directed away from my own emotions. I was pretty upfront with her about what I needed and what didn't work for me, but she wasn't able to provide that.

I was pretty spoiled with my first therapist and would have stayed with her if she hadn't moved out of state. She was able to find a good balance of challenging me and pushing me to confront my own emotions while also being very nurturing and kind.",GrotiusandPufendorf,18g8qo7

I've seen 3 therapists, one was strictly cbt. 2nd was in the middle.

Sometimes there's just a lack or chemistry. I see the therapist relationship almost like a friendship, for lack of a better analogy. Of course there are things that are objectively frowned upon no matter what, but different clients also have different preferences. Personally I don't like therapists who talk a lot (maybe this is true for most), like one woman talked 75% of the time. I would have to cut her off to speak. I'm also not a big fan of the problem solver type. I prefer to vent and be validated and not necessarily come up with a solution (that probably won't work anyway bc of factors I haven't yet told the therapist). A lot of it is knowing your client.

Boundaries started to blur a bit and he no longer was the type of therapist I needed but he really enjoyed working with me, sometimes I felt buttered up. And with hindsight I realised he didn’t want to let me go. That made me feel good short term but uncomfortable long term.

If you just meant a persons internal truth and justice about a situation they went through, I'm wondering what you think could help/ has helped you find that?

5,"Yeah that's probably the route I'd take, hopefully there is something else. You could also try some other types of therapy like dbt or edmr.

For some conditions it's actually extremely common for the person to initially seek help for their depression even though the depression isn't the core issue, and a majority of mental health professionals seem to want to label everything as depression or anxiety, so it wouldn't be that far fetched for something to have been missed.",,1ax4bru

Then I got a trauma educated therapist who I think does psychodynamic therapy (idek, it’s not CBT or DBT though) and EMDR. Now I’ve made more progress in 3 years than the prior 5 combined.

1,"The question of “why isn’t therapy working” has lots of answers. Here are are some of the common ones:

-Your therapist is poorly trained, is inexperienced, or isn’t trained to treat your condition. Problems with therapists being poorly trained are very real!

- You have a substance use disorder you need to treat first. Hard to treat depression if you are smoking weed all day for example.

- You need a specialized therapy that you haven’t tried yet. DBT for emotional dysregulation, mood swings or a trauma specific therapy for PTSD.

-You aren’t willing to do things outside of the therapy session. Therapy isn’t a passive treatment and your therapist shouldn’t be working harder than you are. 

-You are afraid of getting better. Sounds weird, but people can get attached to the “sick person” role and even build their identity around it. 

-Your environment is terrible. For example, if you are actively in an abusive DV relationship, your mood simply isn’t going to be good. The therapist can help you identify this environmental problem and make a plan. 

There are more but those are common ones.

I don’t even feel safe around therapists, I just see them as a danger. I had to see a dentist months ago for teeth extractions, and I had such a severe flashback that I was shaking violently in fear. The dentist, bless her, had to stop the appointment and tried to help calm me down.

Upon returning to therapy for the last time, they said I was better, as if they were involved somehow in the process. Yeah sure, defintely not cuz you belittled me or anything - I digress

All in all, therapy can work if the therapists willing to push you toward self improvement, no matter how uncomfortable it get. If they act like a sentient voice recorder tho- nah, drop em.",throwsomwthingaway,1ckqmg4
4,"Most therapy is skill based, however there are therapy modalities that are just talk therapy. Psychodynamic (talk) therapy comes to mind.

7,"A story for you. After a lifetime of abuse and manipulation by a mentally ill narcissistic mother and an equally narcissistic alcoholic father I decided I might need therapy. While it was often interesting and I enjoyed opening up to a non-associated person I would overall leave feeling nothing had improved. After research and seeking other people’s opinions I concluded this: there are people who through a slight chemical imbalance or a faulty sense of self or worth or whatever who talking things through might help. Then there are people who are so mired in BS, who’s problems are caused by those around them that no amount of medicine or talking is every going to solve it. Additionally it is not therapy’s goal to instruct people on how to live or what to change or do. They let you figure it out. For the first group that actually works well. Their life is seemingly good but something is just off. The second group has so much broken around them they need actual actionable advice which therapy cannot give. Medicine can cure an imbalanced set of chemistry. It cannot, ever, make someone who is abusing you everyday stop, nor turn you into a superhero to “save yourself”. So for the first group, talk therapy and medicine could be the 5% shift they need to feel right and enjoy their already pretty stable life. The second group is basically screwed because society has no interest in solving deeply rooted social problems.",slabzzz,1ckqmg4

12,"Same here. Tried different therapists, never liked any of them. The most helpful thing one ever said to me was introducing me to the term schizoid, which let me find this subreddit. That's pretty helpful but very indirect. Another therapist laughed at me for one of my problems, as in he asked a direct question, I answered, and he had a genuine belly laugh for like five whole seconds. I wasn't trying to be funny. He even apologized afterwards lol, but that was the last time I saw him. I didn't really care because I wasn't close to him anyway.

Once I met a therapist/social worker on Reddit who I grew close to and developed a great friendship with over months, then was suddenly cut off from them (mostly my own fault, don't get me wrong) without a chance to talk, while my life was getting worse and worse. She cuts me off but messages me again herself about a year later, which I ignore. But then a couple years after that, maybe a year ago from now, I message her with a brief apology, and she tells me that if she ever hears from me again she'll call the cops. I assume she's got her own problems, both mentally and in life, but it still deeply hurt and I'm still not over it. I don't think I would ever trust a therapist after that.

All of this is completely independent of the healthcare system itself being so broken and unempathethic in different places, often in the worst ways. Even if you seek proper care, and are able to pay for it, there's no guarantee you'll be treated well. Sorry for the rant.

I’ve found real growth in the past from traumatic events by focusing on my passions. Diving into my hobbies. Getting better at small things no one else would notice. It’s hard, it sucks and it takes a lot of time to see results but I’ve found this to be the ultimate form of therapy personally.

40,"I think modality is super important. Think of it like speciality. Would you go to a dentist with a heart problem? Or to an eye doctor with a broken leg? They can give you some general help but won't be able to help you heal your specific issue.

This is why diagnosis is important too, so you can go to the right kind of therapist. If you have mild depression or anxiety disorder, CBT might work. If you have BPD, DBT might work. If most of your problems stem from trauma, then look for a trauma therapist.

And once you know the skill set you are looking for, then you can look at if the chemistry is right and they can help. Most short term therapies, like CBT, don't help with the root cause of your illness, they will help you manage it. Long term therapies, like trauma therapy (which has a plethora of approaches) can take many many years and won't ""cure"" you but help you accept and process so you feel less distress.",deviantdaeva,1ckqmg4
41,"Yes and yes.

Research tells us that the biggest predictor of success in therapy is whether or not the therapist and patient can create a therapeutic alliance. So yes, meshing is critical.

The modality question is more complex. If I have garden variety depression and some mildly weird family problems… many different modalities may work well.

Keep in mind some providers are better than others - I myself had a not so great CBT experience with one provider years ago. Now, I am seeing another who is also doing CBT and it is working well. It can take some shopping around to find someone who really knows the craft well (it is very hard to do these therapies well, IMO) and is a match for you personally. Hang in there.

You might also consider a referral to a psychiatrist or psychiatric nurse practitioner for medications. Oftentimes, medications can help facilitate more effective psychotherapy, as people become less ""bogged down"" by their most acute symptoms and are able to engage with the therapy more effectively.

As an afterthought, sometimes childhood trauma can lead to interpersonal issues, emotional dysregulation, feelings of emptiness, anger, self-destructive behaviors, etc. For those types of issues, DBT is considered the most effective form of treatment.",Cautious_Mousse1357,y2h4jp

18,"I haven’t done EMDR but I’m on a waitlist now after reading up on it. I told a therapist no thanks to emdr ten years ago cus I thought it sounded fake. But now, it’s clear it’s exceptionally helpful for many and I’ve met people who swear by it. 

I just started neurofeedback as well from my reading on the subject. I’ve noticed some modest improvements from my first session. 

I went to therapy for many years, I learned that talking about it over and over / exposure therapy made me worse, even ‘self indulgent with self pity’ my words to describe my state with those kinds of therapies. 

I found a therapist who specialized in trauma who was as intelligent (or likely much more) than I am, earned my respect / developed a rapport with me and then didn’t hold back in calling me out when I insisted 2+2 does not equal 4. That was key, I found that many therapists I had either were easily mislead by myself or refused to call me on my bs (please note I was not purposely trying to sabotage my therapy, but rather it’s common that we just aren’t ready to face things or own up to something or accept responsibility or whatever sometimes and we can be the obstacle standing in our own way more often than not.) 

I think finding someone who knows how to bond with you and can call you out in a way you will listen to is the best advice I can give. 

I also had a therapist misdiagnose me in his head (he never told me the dx) and began treating me as if I had that dx. It was weird and obvs didn’t work for me. When I told my better therapist (who is/was excellent) he laughed and filled me in (he could tell from my description of the therapeutic approach the guy thought I was a borderline personality rather than a PTSD victim who was actively suffering.) 

Sometimes therapists are wrong and applying the wrong tactics even when they’re doing the style you like (cbt etc)

You need to have three or four goals and they need to make sure that they're working with you on a plan to get there.

And the therapist should be able to tell you if "" not something I can handle or I know how to deal with""

4,"As a mental health professional, being in the right kind of therapy does matter. However, if you're in CBT therapy it can still be helpful in treating Bipolar. DBT therapy is primarily used for people with Borderline Personality Disorder but can be helpful for other situations where struggling to sort through your emotions and make better choices based off how you're feeling too. Therapy helps Bipolar in the sense that it does give coping skills and opportunities to process through situations or things your experience in your life that also include Bipolar.  CBT therapy is primarily used to help change thoughts and behaviors for better outcomes. It also helps dispel cognitive distortions or certain thought processes we have that often times creates challenges. If you haven't already, don't be afraid to bring up to your therapist that you're unsure of how your treatment has been helpful and be upfront with them about some of the deficits you feel you're experiencing with the therapy. Therapists are used to these kinds of conversations and welcome it! 

I'll also mention that Bipolar is a mental disorder that needs a high compliance with meds. I know a lot of people struggle with staying current with their meds for various reasons, but meds greatly help stabilize someone's' moods and baseline so that they aren't going from one extreme to another between depression and mania. Being stable in your moods for the most part will help you better work through the situations in life that effect your emotionally. I greatly discourage you from quitting your meds. If you're not happy with you current med regimen have a talk with your psychiatrist to re-evaluate your options.",IntrovertGal1102,1al5lwp

What is can do is teach you  to identify problematic thought patterns before they become problematic behaviors and help you develop tools to contain/manage/redirect those thoughts into healthier channels.  That's literally what CBT is.


I've never done therapy of any sort, but I can testify to the fact that just being able to identify what's going on has helped massively with my panic attacks.  I still have them roughly as often, but they're shorter and less severe because I have firm facts and logic to help counter that rabid squirrel racing around in my brain shrieking that OMG WE'RE GONNA DIE!!!!  Because I recognize the pattern, I can tell squirrel that no, this is a panic attack and it only* feels*  like we're gonna die and if I take the longest, deepest breath I can, then another and another, this too shall pass.",DammitKitty76,1al5lwp

When we get to a point where episodes of either depression or mania aren't as wild and feel fairly calm and stable, it can be a bit of an adjustment. The fact that you haven't had episodes in a few months is actually great news! It means the meds and therapy is working. But often times there can be an element of feeling as though something's not quite right as we might typically be used to more ""noise"" going on in our lives when a disorder has been unmanageable in the past. With mental health, when things seem ""quiet"" or feels as though nothing is really happening....that's what stabilization is! ;) Keep doin what you're doin!",IntrovertGal1102,1al5lwp
0,"My opinion is that therapy does work, and, depending on what someone's challenges are, different types do work better. Because people's experiences are so vastly different it's really hard to get a clear idea of which approach is the most effective. I have a few thoughts about your predicament, but please know I am making big assumptions based off of just your post so feel free to correct me as needed:

* Generally for anxiety-related disorders cognitive-behavioral interventions (CBT/ACT/DBT/ERP), and potentially medication if the symptoms are severe, are the most effective. However, it's not a silver bullet. It can only do so much. After 5 years of CBT, you have most likely learned all the techniques you can learn in this modality. A modality such as ACT/DBT may teach you new ways of approaching these symptoms, including acceptance that they may not change. 

* One way of thinking about mental wellness is by picturing a stool with many legs. Let's say some of the legs are labeled *Psychotherapy,* *Pills,* *People,* *Physical Health,* *Purpose.* A stool needs three legs to stand firm (more is better). So let's say someone goes to therapy but they're not medicated (if they need to be), has few social connections, has poor physical health, and has no goals/guidance...well it's going to be a wobbly stool. Strengthening the other legs is going to give someone the best foundation for therapy to be effective. Again I don't know how these factors may be playing out in your life.

* As you noted, a certain percentage of people report not having clinical improvement. [There are a whole host of factors that influence this](https://www.anxietycentre.com/therapy/15-reasons-why-some-people-dont-find-therapy-helpful/#:~:text=A%20person%20who%20is%20a,faster%20progress%20than%20he%20is.). It may be worth a read to see if you may be facing some of these barriers with your therapy work. 

* Lastly, you mention seeing ""5-6 specialists."" I don't know if you're referring to therapists or medical providers, so I will assume the former. One of the single biggest indicators of therapeutic success is the client/therapist relationship. This is called the [Therapeutic Alliance](https://therapymeetsnumbers.com/the-therapeutic-alliance/) and it is extremely important. If you have changed therapists 5-6 times over the last 5 years, it makes sense why you feel like your progress is slow. 

So with all these different factors, I think therapy can still work for you! If you're able to identify some potential barriers (such as poor therapeutic alliance), prioritize a therapist who ""fits"" you vs. a specific therapy modality, and work to improve some of the other legs of your mental wellness stool I think you'll get some good mileage.",Tickets2ride,18kglq1

24,"I told a psychiatrist ( year 2013) that I had problems keeping focus and lacked energy. I think about millions of possibilities in a whole year and I can’t focus on one. 

He then asked me 3 questions 
And one was : what do you think about when i say the word “Red”, and I said “blood”, like the blood of my brother when I saw him get shot when I was 10. 

Just that answer alone he wanted to prescribe me anti psychosis medication. 

What I was actually suffering from was a spine injury back in 2009 and I JUST had TWELVE (set of 6) spinal steroid injections in the span of ONE month, given muscle relaxers (blocks pain reception) and MAN I HAVEN’T FELT BETTER IN A VERY FREAKING LONG TIME. Still have some pain (pain that isn’t there but it’s by memory of how it felt, discomfort BUT NOT PAIN where I would cry sometimes thinking that my spine would fail one day.) 


I don’t know what you’re going through but be careful and I would suggest an MRI scan of your brain to see if there are any abnormalities, but you’ll have to go to a physician and tell them that you hit your head really hard and you feel that you have a concussion ( say blacked out dizziness, fainting) to get a referral. 

Anyways, I also was given adderall by my previous girlfriend who was studying to be a pharmacist (those people with white coats at the pharmacy? Yeah those are actually DOCTORS, yeah, I didn’t know that either before dating her) and there was no pain and extreme focus, I was on my computer and wrote a pre lawsuit letter to a company that paid me $4,000 the next day. (NO JOKE)
My thesis is that adderall created an extraordinary amount of energy and my body not only had energy to heal but to also run my brain at full speed. It sucks people abuse this drug, it’s AMAZING !!!!!

Man sometimes I think I should of stuck to Med school but I think of ways all the time to either get honorary degrees or make a massive impact on the way we use and understand medicine. 

Anti psychosis medication limits the amount of either dopamine or norepinephrine. Both of which will make you pretty much SLOWS your brain down.

This year I made an appointment with a different doctor in a new clinic and she is LOVELY. Sometimes she'll call just because she wants to check in and make sure I'm doing on. I look forward to her calls now. She set me up with a full physical assessment, started me on a low dose of SSRI until I saw the phychiatrist she referred me to. She's also put me in contact with local metal health services too.

The roots of RTT are drawn from areas of traditional psychotherapy (such as gestalt), CBT, positive suggestion therapy, parts therapy, inner child work and mindfulness. What makes it super powerful is that the process is done under hypnosis. RTT is a highly personalized approach that helps you to reframe any negative beliefs, values, habits and emotions – many of which you may have carried with you since childhood. By giving you the potential to alter the way you think and put an end to negative self-talk, you can approach life in a positive way and move forward, liberated from the presenting problem. ""*

Therapists typically are in their 20s and did a min wage job, went to college, and became a therapist

They know absolutely nothing because therapy is a fake science, its like talking to a high schooler

Your average therapeutic advice can be summed up as ""Act like a stereotypical adult, eg eat healthy, exercise, go outside, talk to people, be nice, be honest, be responsible"" etc

The worst part is that your diagnosis will follow you for life and prevent you from joining many careers, and also most therapists work with a psychiatrist to sell drugs to sad people",,osu9jw

However, from my experience it’s really difficult to actually enforce this. I actively tried to have my mum sectioned because she was a serious risk to me and herself and I was 19 at the time and trying to study and look after her and stop her from killing her self but each time she was assessed they said she didn’t pose enough of a risk so was let home again.

however I also did CBT before I did EMDR because my therapist thought that starting with EMDR first could be to much for me to handle at the time. 

In my opinion, it's best to find a method of therapy or combination of therapy and medicaton that works for you. This can be differend depending on the individual. That is why I included that last part about finding an other therapist if the first one does not work out.

from your post it sounds like you had some bad experiances with multiple therapist and other healthcare profesinals.

We can’t hospitalize people for self-harming or because they used to feel suicidal. We also can’t keep people in the hospital for very long. After only a few days, the person has the right to a court hearing to fight against their commitment, and the judge will only keep the person in the hospital after that hearing if the psychiatrist has made a very, very compelling case that the person will likely die if they are released.

I want to offer you a solution because I believe there’s a reason why medications might not be working forever.

Life is temporary, and God wants us to know that we shouldn't be dependent on these medications. There’s a reason why meditating often at a church helps. You need something different, a whole new lifestyle change, and to know your purpose. Islam has all of that.

Everything you’re going through, all the pain you’re enduring, can be solved by submitting to Allah.

I saw a different mental health nurse, at the start of the year, and they said I had strong personality traits, when I explained I find it hard to regulate my emotions. 
I went to see my GP, explained to them how much I am struggling, (at least I thought I did) and they made me an app for MH nurse, that’s when she told me I just had to deal with it/get over it. 
I don’t know how to explain to people, I’m starting to want to have a physical ailment so people realise there is something wrong. All I keep getting told is to do CBT but I honestly don’t find it useful, as I have pass trauma and different things, childhood neglect, narcissist mother, abusive partner, mentally abusive partner….the list goes on.

At best, it’s a process that helps you have better awareness of the relationships between what you think, how you feel, what you believe and what you do. It’s pretty structured and very effective. 

The plea deal was probably done figuring if you had therapy, what you learned in therapy would make you more cognizant of whatever lead up to the choices that got you to that point and you’d be better equipped to make different choices in the future.

7,"So, I am not a legal expert and whatever the situation is or isn’t, I know I don’t know, don’t need to and don’t want to know enough details to give any insight for that. 

However, the answer to the last part is no. You don’t just get out of jail without a lot of extra stuff. Parole is basically what happens. I suggest you ask your lawyer what it might look like for you so you can make an informed decision. 

Jail in and of itself - also not great. In Jail your whole schedule including whether you can eat, go outside or sleep is dictated by someone else. Same with who you room with. Guess where the toilet is. 

Long story short: CBT is a decent option, whether it helps or not is up to you, but it won’t hurt. It teaches you a lot about how to manage yourself without telling you what to think or do. Jail is an option for you, but personal beliefs and biases about therapy may be influencing your judgement about what jail vs therapy looks like.
