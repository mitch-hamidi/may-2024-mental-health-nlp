1,It doesnt just start or stop working. It takes time,Lahooooouzzerr_669,101qrai
2,"I just want to make a quick disclaimer to any other readers that I am not anti therapy, it can work great IF in the correct one. 

Iâ€™ve been in therapy for years, CBT, talking therapies you name it . My one before this (MBT) was working and there was change. I was changed therapies(to another MBT) except all of my information given is written in reports and shared with multiple institutions, surprisingly I donâ€™t have a choice due to my dv situation. Any information I share; even if way in the past is used to make assumptions about how I may parent in the future and then I am treated as if I am already doing that; despite being assessed as a fit parent, who hasnâ€™t done anything within my childâ€™s life to cause concern. This therapy is beginning to feel like a punishment due to abuse I suffered and did not react to. 

This particular therapy unfortunately isnâ€™t helping.",justhereinitlol,101qrai

1,"MBT is a pretty evidence based treatment (im trained in it myself). But what are you looking for, ideally?",Eviljaffacake,lbpj03
2,"Unbelievable..sorry to hear this. I feel as though the mht are against me atm,so anything they do upsets me. For instance they swapped phone numbers on the day of my assessment,said they would phone on a withheld number,then rang me on a landline?",livewire2001,lbpj03
3,"I'm not opposed to MBT in itself, I just don't think it's the right time (or alternatively I don't fully understand it). I need to talk to someone about past issues I am having trouble processing, as I feel I can't move forward and work on my interpersonal relationships until I can process what's happened in the past.

I'm training to be a counsellor (or at least I'm having a MH/pandemic break now) and I've been struggling to move on without processing my past in a safe therapeutic space.",lawraa,lbpj03
4,"Worth discussing this with those involved.

But what I usually say is that the past and present tend to go hand in hand when it comes with management of trauma, and MBT could address this.

Good luck!",Eviljaffacake,lbpj03

Talk to your loved ones! Maybe write this rant in a more eloquent written letter and give it to your girlfriend. 
Buy self-help books, write a journal 

You are clearly in a fucking bad place, the you right now is hurting you and the people arround you! 

I really hope you'll get better in the end! 
If you need help with your ED buy a book that is based on a more biochemical basis. Those books helped me better to understand the reaction of the body then the normal self-help books.

I wish you all the best and the resolution yo work on yourself ",bascoa,84zjz0

2,"Thank you for your reply :]
im currently waiting to start MBT which will be 18 months to 2 years of therpy. Im in the uk and ive been discharged by the NHS MH services and referred to the personality disorder service. MH service feel nothing they offer can help so its a case of waiting for the MBT. private therapist isnt an option unfortunately. I talk to my girlfriend about this stuff and i dont feel my family are an option. well i do talk to my older sister a bit but she doesnt really understand a lot and she is always busy so its difficult anyway. Ive never actually thought about self help books, thats something i shall look into. I wish i could get into doing a journal, writing my thoughts down has helped in the past. My concentration is rubbish, i get sidetracked so easily. its like drawing, i used to love drawing and it was a good distraction but i cannot focus enough on just drawing, it has to be perfect or i feel frustration creeping in and i give up. i should give a journal a go.",Krychex,84zjz0
3,"Thanks for your reply, I am a bit slow responding but life, yknow? Taken years to get the diagnosis I have and years of confusion. Youâ€™ll get to a point where you can talk, itâ€™ll happen. Rolling with the punches? Iâ€™m trying to not self harm! I jest, of course. Sometimes it gets too tiring and I donâ€™t wanna keep going but I am definitely at a point where I know I have to jump at the therapy Iâ€™m offered. I feel like Iâ€™m proper rambling now so I shall finish with thanks and best of luck for you moving forward :) ",Krychex,84zjz0
