0,How prevalent is your childhood trauma in your life today?,"Maybe it’s affecting you, and you don’t realize?

1,All trauma is trauma!,"**All trauma is trauma.**  


To the brain, anything that is traumatic, or causes hurt or pain, is trauma.  


There is no gauge to say how severe a trauma is.  


Don't invalidate your trauma just because you think that it is not as severe as someone else's trauma. It doesn't work like that.  


All trauma is valid. All trauma is trauma.  


There are so many different types of trauma.  


Emotional neglect with a parent working too much during your childhood.  
Physically abused by a parent.  


Both examples above are trauma to the brain.  


But .. regardless of the trauma, you are not broken. You deserve the same amount of love, joy and happiness as everyone else. And you can get it.  


Stop telling yourself that you are not whole, that you're not worthy and drserving. Tell yourself the opposite and maybe you start to finally believe it.  


Maybe you were emotionally abused or physically abused .. and you have been telling yourself every since that you don't deserve love and affection. And now? .. you believe it right? This is your story. Well, change the story. Identify the story that you've been telling yourself, find the lies in the story .. and make up a new one, a truthful one. One where you are deserving of everything you want and more.",1619524678.0,False,472,42,Amyshesgotthis,None,mzmt4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mzmt4k/all_trauma_is_trauma/
2,How could childhood trauma and physical trauma manifest in adulthood,"When I(33m) was 2 years old my parents divorced. Both remarried by the time I was 3. By 3.5 years old, my mom gave birth to my half sister. From that point on, I have always felt like an afterthought. My half sister always got more toys than me, she got to go more places, and do more fun things. When we moved into another house, I got a really small bedroom-almost the size of a closet and my sister go the big bed room. There was always more pictures of her displayed than of me. So when I was 9 years old, I moved to my dad’s house. I lived with my dad, stepmom and stepbrother. It didn’t take long for me to figure out that the same thing was going to be happening at my dad’s. My stepbrother was obviously my stepmoms favorite. She always got him stuff, let him do pretty much anything he wanted, gave him money to go out and do things that I wasn’t allowed to do. My dad saw how unfairly I was being treated but he never stood up for me. I felt all alone. 

I should also mention that When I was 7 I had a severe head injury. I fell off of the roof of a parked truck and hit the back of my head on the blacktop driveway. My parents didn’t take me to the hospital until about a week later when I kept getting nosebleeds and throwing up. I was near death before my parents took me to the hospital. I ended up having to get flown in a helicopter from a small hospital to the children’s hospital. My brain had 3 hematomas, a blood clot, and severe bruising all on my frontal lobe, as well as a fractured skull. Luckily, my brain stopped swelling before surgery was needed.  

With that being said, how could this stuff manifest in my adult life? Is there any type of treatment for this? I feel as though my emotional regulation is regressing. I struggle with relationships, friendships, family, and work. I am the common denominator.

4,Am I actually trauma dumping/trauma bonding? ,"I was at a get together with friends and we were all drunk. I was trying to find a photo on my phone when I ran into a photo of my bf who committed suicide several years ago and it stopped me in my tracks and when they looked at my phone I tried to laugh it off and said ""sorry, ran into my bf who killed himself"" and immediately my friend declared ""trauma bonding moment!"" Twice. Is the one joke actually me trying to do this? My other friend group and I have made mutual humor about it bc they know it helps me normalize/lighten the subject (idk if that's weird, the joke r not making fun of him or that it happened, more so just glossing over it? Idk if that makes sense?). I guess I just whipped out the wrong joke with the wrong group? The girl I said it to chuckled with me and I proceeded to find the picture I was looking for. She was unphased but my friend was upset. This isn't the first time she's declared me vaguely mentioning my struggle with mental health ( I genuinely only said I was not doing well mentally and needed to talk about it to someone and that I was actively seeking therapy and she told me I should keep it to myself and journal about it) or mentioning my parents love is severely conditional, without any details. I feel like I am starting to hate her but I think I'm most likely in the wrong. But her shutting me down and telling me to keep things to myself and telling people I trauma dump is upsetting me.

6,How do you “let go” of trauma/your past? ,"I always see people saying to truly heal trauma or even heal anxiety you need to “let go”. I can guess that they mean like don’t let it effect your life massively but i just don’t understand how to do that or work towards that. 

I have pretty severe trauma and i also have agoraphobia, BPD and panic disorder as a result, i’ve done almost a decade of therapy (before during and after my trauma) and im also taking medication. I still seem to have my past looming over me always despite feeling like im relatively healed/over it, it’s always there and still gets in the way often. 

I know there’s no quick way to heal this kind of thing but i genuinely don’t really know any skills on how to manage this stuff if im being honest, a lot of my recovery focus has been on my anxiety rather than my trauma as it was the most pressing issue up until very recently. I know especially with my BPD diagnosis im never truly going to be “normal” but i do want to be the best version of myself i can be *despite* my diagnosis!

9,What are some trauma responses that you only realized after growing up?,"For me:  
1.Freeze response:  
When someone shouts at me, I become speechless. It feels like I turn into stone, thoughts swirling in my mind, but my mouth is glued shut, and my limbs are stiff and unable to move. Usually, the other person would command me more angrily, ""Speak up!"" Later, I realized this was the freeze response at play.  
2.Habitual apologies:  
I constantly apologize for various trivial matters. If I'm particularly anxious, I'll repeat apologies over and over again. Even when told to stop apologizing, I reflexively apologize again. This habitual apology behavior makes me constantly reflect on my faults, even those that aren't mine, and often leads me to doubt myself.  
3.Fear of seeking help:  
Even in difficult situations, I find it hard to ask others for help and always bear everything alone. I used to think it was because I was too independent and strong.

10,How to deal with trauma that’s not really trauma?,"I’m realizing that most of my MH struggles are due to ferociously trying to avoid ending up like my parents. 

IMO their life is chaotic and sad and I don’t want it. The short version is that my mom has chronic physical and mental health issues that she won’t get proper help for so she can’t fully function and my dad just says everything is fine when it’s not, and they just don’t handle things that life throws at them [and TBF life has thrown them a lot] and so it’s like everything they have or do is broken or a hassle in some way. Their relationship is nonexistent. They’re just roommates. And everything is just a series of difficulties. 

Growing up, I was the oldest and I think I internalized all the struggles of never having enough money for anything, mom being unwell, housework and maintenance not being managed, and just a constant low hum of stress in the background all of the time. 

But that’s it. I don’t have any real trauma. No one abused me, no one hurt me, no one lied to me, we always had food to eat, a roof over our heads, and clothes to wear. I wasn’t emotionally abused either. My parents were good and loving and they tried. So hard. 

But now that I’m married, 32, and have a baby and a home, etc., I’ve developed this weird obsession with productivity, maintaining our home, making enough money… basically anything that I feel would keep my life from turning out like my parents’. I always feel like I’m one failure away from slipping into the abyss of struggle and not being able to get out. 

I’m well aware that therapy can help with this, please don’t flood me with comments suggesting that. I know. I’ve done 12 weeks of counseling for PPD previously and I’m considering getting more but I don’t have health coverage that will pay for it (long story— please no advice on that front either). 

But what I would like comments on is if there’s a name for this trauma-that’s-not-trauma, and if there are any good books or practices, or tips or anything that might help in the meantime while I try to figure out hopefully returning to therapy. 

Thanks in advance. 🩷

11,What would you consider trauma?,"For reference, friend and I are both queer.

Recently, my friend said they've been traumatized by their old classmates joking around with the word gay as an bad thing. When I asked about it, the friend said that their classmates never bullied them and never said homo to or around my friend.
From my perspective, homophobia is a trauma when you're either bullied because of it or when people around you, like friends or family, beat into your head how to be ""normal"" and that ""homosexuality is bad.""
I thought at first that it didn't sound very traumatizing.

""People around me have also been somewhat homophobic, and I've never seen it as trauma"" - of course that doesn't mean I should undermine my friend's experience or tell them it's nothing if it's a big deal to them.

But then I thought, what is the definition of trauma? Have I used the word too loosely when there are people out here who are actually traumatized?
I've used it sporadically in relation to my upbringing with bullying at school, and emotional abuse at home, but were my experiences too light compared to what trauma actually is?

Hope you're doing well. Have a nice day.

17,is this trauma? what is trauma?,"just recently, like midseptember, i came out of what i've been calling a traumatic situation. but there is a lot of doubt involved. i've heard all the stuff about not blaming oneself, but my situation really feels different

sparing the details, if there was an ""abuser"" and an ""abused"" in my situation, i think i was the abuser. it turned people's heads, made them think worse of me, harmed my reputation, and if i'd met that version of me as a stranger, i would shun me

a good person reality checked me hard, and my world fell apart around me, my identity was torn down, and i'm in the process of rebuilding it.

the abrupt change of mind and abject disgust at myself and my actions are what weighs on my mind, and won't go away. i am haunted by my recent memories. i've stashed away old objects, stopped listening to certain songs. anything that reminds me of the stretch of time from midseptember to 2 summers prior is off limits. i've got a skeleton in my closet, and i want to go back in time and change it, but i can't, so i'm trying to forget instead.

i go on a long rant like this one in my head every day. i think really nasty things about the one i consider the victim, like i will never come back, i never want to see them again, i wish i could forget i ever knew them. i wish this person the best. i'm just so so sorry they ever came to know me, and i'm sorry for the years of unpacking they're gonna have to do.

in my defense, i am a weird sheltered antisocial previously-traumatized barely-adult who has no clue how to be something other than an alien. i always think i should have known better, but also how could i have known? i did not act out of malice, or out of depravity. i acted out of steadfast delusion. it disgusts me, thoroughly. i want to burn the past. but where is the line between delusion and depravity? abused children often become abusers. when are they no longer excusable? i fear that if i had been left unchecked longer, i would have done much more harm, unspeakable harm. i thank every star in the sky that people checked me on my bullshit.

anyway, this has turned into a rambly vent post. i didn't mean for it to get like that. here's the point: i was weird and bad and very irresponsible for a year. it hurt the other person and also me by extension. i think about it every day. i feel like a monster, some memories are off-limits, and the thought of interpersonal closeness repulses me like it never has before. any insight at all is appreciated",1701070261.0,False,1,0,doallwithoutdoing,None,184xfbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/184xfbk/is_this_trauma_what_is_trauma/

26,Childhood trauma,"The usual story here, used to get bullied as a kid. I suppose I might had mildly androgenic looks as a boy and also being from a rural area didn't help either. Thankfully was not abused sexually in a physical way but the whole gawking from my own gender folks and sexual innuendos did leave a mark on my personality at large. Consequently, I turned out to be an introvert and chose a profession that would guarantee I wouldn't leave my house very often.  
Now the problem I face is the way I react to different situations as an adult. I think I have a good personality (funny (for the first few interactions), do work out often, have a good physique and above-average looks) but I don't let people get very close to me. The usual pattern goes something like this, I meet new people, give them a good first impression, they try to get close, my childhood trauma kicks in and I straight up ghost them or feel repulsed/threatened by their presence. I feel uncomfortable making eye contact and getting in close contact with the male gender. I hate sharing my personal space with anyone, this sometimes stands true for even my blood relatives. I feel like I have erected so many invisible barriers around myself that I might soon become super unapproachable.  
This behavioral pattern is hindering so much progress in my life that it's depressing. I don't want to open up about my childhood trauma to anyone. I'm going to get married soon, and I feel like this might affect my marriage. But, I'm not sure about it, because I only feel hostility from my gender.  
To my friends and family, I'm a perfectly functional person but this brewing feeling inside me sometimes eats me from inside out.

Ever since I was maybe five (5) years old, ive been a very big day dreamer. Even when I was a child, the day dreams would be very graphic; people I cared about getting hurt/tortured in every way you could possibly think of. It started with people I knew in real life, and I knew I never wanted any of these things to happen to these people in real life, but seeing them suffer in my head has always been the only thing that I can think of before I fall asleep.

As I got older, this habit started to consume me. I know im going to sound like a horrible person for admitting this, but please note that, again, I do not wish any of these actions on anyone in real life. I eventually stopped daydreaming about IRLs and began to hyper fixate on celebrities/content creators. I would study how these people/characters think, and break them over and over again. I would fixate for hours on these people being tortured, r worded, id capitalize on their vulnerable mental state.

It feels like I am addicted to intrusive thoughts, and I dont know how to stop, or get help. I don’t know what to do. i’m sixteen (16), and these graphic daydreams are causing me to slip up in school, and watching constant distress and destruction constantly play in my head is starting to really take a toll on my mental state. Im struggling to stay productive, it feels impossible to keep these thoughts out of my head. 

Im pretty sure this started as a coping mechanism. I used to take advantage of it, and use the fictional suffering to attempt to minimize my own, or allow the characters in my head to carry out my intrusive thoughts so I wouldn’t have to, yet I could still see a visual consequence that I longed for. 

I know this is very unorganized, and if anyone is reading this, I apologize for that. If anyone knows anything at all that can help me stop daydreaming, please help me.

28,Invalidation as trauma response????,"Im really curious about this but cant find any materials on it. So to paint a picture, I grew up in poverty not just no-food poverty, i would say extreme and traumatic poverty. Didnt have supportive parents and we made it out alive (my siblings and I) by working real-hard to fill in the gaps of all the normal things we should have but didnt have--house, parents, utilities, food, list goes on. So we kinda have a different meaning when we say the words ""surviving"" and ""poverty"". 

I read a lot of books and psych on  trauma and healing to internally get out of the things I've experienced. BUT I still have yet to understand this:  
when someone (its worse if someone close like my partner) would talk about their version of poverty-- the kind where they didnt had food to eat every now and then and bills to bills situation of a somewhat poor to middle-class family-- I end up invalidating them. internally, I also feel this rift of annoyance like ""this person has no fucking clue what he/she is talking about"". I don't want it but it's there and uncontrolled. sometimes it gets to me and i end up poking on their pain. If the topic was about ""i would rather choose to be born poor and make my way to wealth than handed a silver platter"" or when they start talking about how poor they were before and explaining why only for me to realize the poor they are painting are the things i wanted when i was young, it just make me irk. 

I feel like its wrong and I am invalidating them when I do this so i hold off my tongue. Even if i hold off my tongue, I end up unconciously downsizing their experience and i dont want that.

31,Family trauma pain.,"My grandmother raised me pretty much due to my mom making bad decisions.  To where I'd go see her at this motel & remember seeing her get grabbed by the hair, face slammed into sink.  Remember him using me to manipulate her, Remember other things i don't want to. 
She met my step dad & had my sister. Dad got job offer so we moved states also cause my moms ex would keep finding her. 
We move out here, grandma retires & moves out here to help us.  I have horrid memories of my grandma crying about her pension checks/ money going missing... I'd try telling my grandma the little white lies my mother would tell but It'd always cause conflict and arguments.  
My mom kept my grandma isolated & maniplated until she died. 
My mother had a TBI due to her domestic violent relationship.  She was very sick but due to her hurting me with lies growing up it was hard to believe what was true and what wasnt.. it was an emotionally abusive household with severe mental health issues... 
I was a difficult child. Instead of getting me therapy i got pulled out of school in 6th grade. My ""home schooling"" led to me being told i was to difficult to wake up in the mornings.. my education lacked for years.  During that time i had other traumatic stuff accure but.. my issue with getting into a high school was getting in with 0 middle school credits.  I got an internship found an alternative school & graduated within 2 years.  I got in a 4 year relationship.  Ive always just wanted my own person. I realize now how disconnected i was with my family... all i focused on was my girlfriend.  Who helped me get my first job & driver's license. 
Long story short. 
I was heartbroken for a long time aftr that. Well, 2021 my long time friend me and another friend went to a rave. They were both coked up and drunk. I didnt do much during that time so i just was high af. 
My friend many times would try to get with me. Shed do the most for me, check up on me, reassure me. Make me laugh... she'd say hanging with me would help her not think about coke. Yet id ignore her to just focus arguing with my ex ... 
Welll at this rave my other friend got super drunk so we decided to leave.  She drove us back to her place... she drove fine... we got back we vibed she confessed her feelings, i said i had to leave cause i work early. She begged said shed drive me in the morning.  I said we'd talk when she's sober& left.  Texted her when i got home she tried calling me but i hate talking on the phone so i ignored it..fell asleep. Woke up to 4 missed calls from her. Went to work got the call from her ex that she overdosed.  
Next day i worked at 3pm. An officer called me in to talk to me since i was one of the last people to see her alive so i was VERY emotional.  
Got to work ( i worked at Mcdonalds lol 6 years fuk them. ) DIDNT clock in, tried notifying MULTIPLE managers that i need to talk to them. I stayed 3 hours WORKING in the back, balling my eyes out. Coworker said hed refer the message cause he thinks i should breathe &leave. I go in next day they said i walked off the job.. i go to the main office they said i need to talk to store supervisor.  THATS ANOTHER WHOLE FUCKED UP TRAUMA STORY M C D O N A L D S but anyway. I barley found out my mom claimed unemployment as me & didnt tell me plus stole that years taxes. 
Id always fight with my grandma due to her being so defensive over my mom. Shed always worry about my mom over herself when id see how my mom would treat/lie to her... my grandma passed away & my mom died a month later. 

Two weeks ago.
Then i found out the abuser of my mom was my FATHER 

My mom stole my grandmas retirement money, stimulus's and so much more... i have no family besides my sister. I had to make gofundmes for the cremations even. 
Im skipping so many details that are also so damn painful but man... for example i went to bank of America to open an account... fraud activity popped up. They asked if i knew who ""my moms name"" was. 
I blame myself for not knowing what elder abuse was  cause now im alone and in debt and I DONT KNOW SHIT :(  Got mail from IRS saying i owe 1500 now too just im so overwhelmed and my birthday is the 20th of this month. When my friend passed it was the 10th (today)  of this month. 
Just HAPPY BIRTHDAY MEEE . 
I wanna manifest the good. Im so tired of pain / worry...

32,Is this trauma?,"o, I have a thing about bullying. like asshole characters being assholes. Be it from real life or fiction. Mostly fiction for now.





So when I see one, I just get this very uncomfortable feeling in me that usually turns violent. At least in my inner thoughts. It raises my anxiety up as I see a character like that, especially since I'm an avid reader.





I don't really want to describe what exactly comes to my mind, but they are violent. And I easily get ticked off. More so if it's emotional bullying.  Sometimes I can't help but physically \_tick\_ as well...



And yes, I was bullied once. But the emotional kind at least. If it weren't for the fact that I'm reclusive and rarely see myself out in a public setting I don't think I would have lasted this long honestly. I may have other issues as well like easily breaking under pressure and my instant reaction to it is selfharm... But that's besides the main point of this post maybe?

33,Trauma made me question sexuality,"I (23 F) was abused physically and emotionally abused as kid, by mostly girls/women. After I graduated, Covid hit and that’s when I started feeling low, lonely and lost sense of purpose. I even had suicidal and self harm thoughts.

I found myself attracted to women, and desperate for an emotional connection and physical comfort. When I told my new therapist about me questioning sexuality, she told me to think why that might be since her approach is all about analysis. I came to a realization that the fact trauma was caused by women; nurses who tied me to the bed when I was in psych ward, students who bullied me, teachers who didn’t protect me and my mother who didn’t hug me enough as a child might be a factor that made me question sexuality as a way to cope.

I hope I’ll someday recover. For now, I’ll take my time to find myself, and enjoy life as it is. I’m sharing my story because I know someone out there is struggling, and to remind them they’re not alone in their journey of healing.

I'm so tired and this behavior builds up resentment when it's not reciprocated with appreciation, but really, it's my own doing.

A bunch of things contributed to this - parents with unmanaged mental health and substance abuse issues, verbal and physical abuse, love feeling conditional to my achievements, the pressure that society (particularly from the 80's and 90's) placed on girls in particular.

50,Parentification Trauma Help,"Hello!

Today I seek advice on a deep topic for me. I am a 21(M) and throughout my childhood/adolescent years, I have been subject to very strong parentification of my two younger siblings. This is due to my parents being addicts and pretty much absent.

(Parentification defined: When a children is brought in to the role of parenting someone prematurely)

CPS (at the time) labeled me as a severe parentification cause due to my stepping up to provide and care for my siblings

I come to seek advice because I feel like I have suffered from this experience. I am introverted/closed, have a lot of general and social anxiety, and suffer from a lack of intimate relationships which I believe all 3 were caused by the parentification. 

On a good note, My siblings and I live together, our parents recovered and we have a stable life.

I have heard of people trying therapies out or getting anxiety diagnosed and treated but have no clue where to start with either of those options. if any of you have dealt with this or have advice on this matter, I would love to hear it and apply it.

I swear I don't want to be like my parents ever. But without realizing it, I've started treating my younger sibling the same way my parents treated me. It makes me feel terrible. I've cried myself to sleep after yelling at them without meaning to. I wish I could say sorry, but in my family, we don't talk about our feelings. I've been trying hard to control my anger, but it's tough.

For 7 years I've lived with my best friend who had sexsomnia and when it happened I didn't really feel traumatized, most of the nights he did this I found a way to prevent him from actually touching me, but there have been a few fights and sometimes he would wake up and push me back so hard and go back to his bed, curl up and cry himself to sleep. I wasn't angry or frightened or what, he was my best friend and roommate and everyday living with him was so cool I'd forgive what his sleeping version of himself would do. I never considered this like abuse until very recently.

I don't live with him anymore and this didn't happened since 4 years ago now, but everytime I think of him there are the roughest memories popping automatically.  Recently I had a specific memory that came back to surface I had completely forgotten, and since then I think of it everyday And I don't want to sleep close to him ever again. If I have no choice to sleep in a room next to this I'll find it hard to sleep and have nightmares.

I don't want to think of him like this anymore, we still go out and have activities together. I never felt traumatized but it seems my brain slightly is however. I just have automatic annoying thoughts.

Do you think it's worth seeing a therapist for this ? Is it possible that my trauma is being repressed and maybe someday I could just collapse ? I'm quite confused



PS : cutting ties with him is not an option

54,Do I have trauma?,"So I've been fighting to get ADHD meds for years without much success, late last year I got to a new psych clinic that seemed to actually care to help me, they all but promised me they won't abandon me and they'll help.

I felt like the nightmare is over at last... And then I consented to them seeing my medical files which indicate several comorbidies.

I go there and I'm told a firm ""never"", I broke down and lost it completely, without meds I have just about no hope for the future, I remember next to nothing from the talk other than the fact that I felt the most extreme mental pain I have ever felt.

The fallout from that... Is immense, I no longer trust any healthcare professional, I feel uneasy and uncomfortable around doctors, I cry and break down whenever i attempt to relive that moment, I have woken up at night in tears because I dreamt of it...

What the fuck is going on with me, I was just denied adhd pills, can that really cause this? 

I felt betrayed and hurt in perhaps the worst way possible for me currently, I felt like they cared... instead they told me to fuck off and just get a caretaker or something.

Reason I ask; I remember when I was 15 I had a family friend/teacher that would give me advice and just general support or fun conversation. One time they gave me their personal contact info and told me that they’ve been struggling, we’re switching jobs, but wanted me to have a way to contact them. I responded over email thanking them for their support, that I was sad to hear they had to switch jobs. I told them a story of when I was being bullied, and used to push me around physically at school. But that this person gave me a safe space to go and helped me get through that. I told them I empathized and believe they deserve the best. That dealing with rough moments I felt in the same boat. And then I returned to positive convo. It was the *only* time I really shared details and then on I mostly maintained completely positive updates. Or at the least say “yeah sorry I’m dealing with family stuff.” I would also stay silent irl because I like to listen to others.

I’m also not strong for simply just not killing myself, every time I hear that shit it’s always from someone who has no idea what it’s actually like to be suicidal 100% of the time. I *want* to kill myself, there’s no part of life that I enjoy or that I feel is worth sticking around for and yet I still can’t bring myself to *actually* do it.

I guess that to me, hearing that shit is just a reminder that no one fucking gets it, like 99% of people will just never understand and so they say stupid shit trying to be helpful and don’t realise they’re only really telling you how alone you really are. There’s nothing fucking strong about a man who’s terrified of everyone, who’s constantly suicidal but is too afraid to act on it, and who will never even get to see his own adult body not covered in deep self-harm scars.

64,Struggling with speaking after trauma ,"I'm a 26-year-old woman who's always had some social anxiety, but I used to be able to manage it and communicate without issues. However, after facing significant trauma last year and losing six close friends, my ability to socialize has drastically decreased. Now, I mainly go to work and then straight home, with little social interaction outside of that. 

Lately, speaking has become physically difficult for me. It feels like I've lost the natural ability to move my mouth and lips when I talk. It just feels so difficult to be able to physically make those oral motor movements. I'm constantly aware of how my mouth looks when I speak, and producing words feels awkward and forced. This issue seems to be worsening with people I'm not comfortable around, though it varies even with those I am comfortable with.

On top of this, I've been diagnosed with being on the autism spectrum, OCD (with intrusive thoughts), ADHD, and PTSD within the past year. I was already diagnosed with BPD 2 years ago but I have been in therapy every single week since then and as of right now my triggers and symptoms are manageable. I believe the lack of social interaction, compounded by my recent trauma and diagnoses, has caused a regression in my speech abilities. It's surprising and challenging, especially since I've been relatively high-functioning and was only diagnosed with autism later in life.

Now, I find myself overthinking every aspect of speech, something that seems to come effortlessly to others. At times, it feels nearly impossible.

Does anyone have advice or has anyone gone through something similar? How do you manage or improve speech and social interaction under these circumstances?",1709851689.0,False,3,3,Equivalent_Ad_739,None,1b97yma,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1b97yma/struggling_with_speaking_after_trauma/

Then, when I was still studying mechatronics and had an apprenticeship/internship at a startup right when the COVID-19 pandemic started. They trusted me but I really let them down.
During that time and after I failed many, I failed myself, I've tried to come back and fix my life but it always falls back to a chaotic state.
I have a certain passion for piano performance but then stuff happens and I'm left without my tools and I go through forgetting all that I learned or relearned for months or years.
I struggle with depression and insomnia too, and I've been on and off antidepressants, but my life always ends up spiraling down and I'm left feeling as a waste of economical resources, since I can't sustain myself. And with the piano situation and losing everything I love it feels like I die every year or sometimes even more times a year.
Besides the core of my family, who never understood how I felt or what I liked and just loved me, I don't have any close relations and it's exhausting to live through every new day.
I'd really like to get to a time where I have enough money not to live, and maybe getting rid of my chemical imbalances forever and never to experience those deaths again. I often fantasize after all these heavy years with just dying and part of me wants a solution and I acknowledge it's a tough challenge after everything not to be a magnet for disaster.

I started recording conversations with other people cause I thought there was something wrong with my voice and I tried fixing it accordingly by speaking unnaturally quiet and deep. I still hated my voice even after that, so I refocused on something else.

I started filtering what I was saying, decided I would never say anything filler-like which resulted in my behaviour once again being unnatural. I don't speak a lot, people tell me to talk more, so now I spoke even less, I am also not very expressive, so this made me sound like a robot.

I woke up from these behavioural patterns after the summer holidays ended and I had to return to normal task-filled life, I messed this up by neglecting my sleep and drinking higher doses of caffeine which resulted in my anxiety going over the roof to the point where I could barely function. I cut caffeine and started sleeping better after months, so I did fix that and now I am alright, my discomfort was caused by these two factors which I understand, but I don't get why I behaved the way I did during summer.

I’ve been dealing with really severe DPDR, shallow processing, blank mind, anhedonia… things like that for quite a while now.  I spend a lot of mental energy trying to just accept it for what it is.  

But I sometimes get this weird feeling, when I’m trying to figure out why I’m so sick, that God is punishing me for being gay.  

The logical half of me knows this can’t be true, but the idea sneaks into my head every now and then anyway.  Along with many other voices from when I was first trying to understand and accept my sexuality that told me it was “just a phase” or that “this isn’t the path for you” .. even times when people have told me before that I don’t “look gay”

Like it’s a weird thing… I don’t think God hates gay people (if there even is one at all), but I feel sometimes like I’m being punished in specific because I’m straying from the path God set for me to take specifically and being gay wasn’t on that path.

I’ll say again that logically I don’t think this is true at all.  I’m not even sure if I’d call myself religious.  I wish I could forget about the concept entirely… of a God that punishes or a world where any deity would see being gay as a sin.

I tend to over intellectualize my thoughts and emotions so I'm going to try and keep the quick and not spend forever typing it out, sorry if there is typos.
I ( F28) recently started therapy and got diagnosed with PTSD after dealing with anxiety and panic attacks most of my adult life. This diagnosis did not come as a suprise to me. 

My father was was an emotionally abusive alcoholic who took his own life via self inflicted gunshot when I was 9yo. Despite his issues I loved my father very much and was very much a ""daddies girl.""  Most of his emotional abuse was aimed at my mother and older brother. I was in the home at the time he took his life and have blips of memory, but the bad visuals are not something I can remember. I also have other chunks of memory from childhood missing. I spent most of my teenage years retraumatizing myself and suffering other traumas that typically happen when the sole provider of a family is lost. I spent much of my early 20s working really hard to create a stable life,  trying to heal,  and telling myself I had ""dealt with it."" 

I am now in my late 20s. I have what im convinced is the worlds most supportive partner (29M) and father to our two beautiful children(6M with special needs, 2F.) I am dealing with almost constant anxiety, hypervigilance, sleeping issues, internal rage,  and panic attacks, and lack of focus... 

I have worked so hard to create a beautiful life out of what was a pretty shitty childhood and I just want to be able to be a present, authentic mother and partner who feels sure of herself. I am exhausted. Hence the seeking of professional help. 

Has anyone been through the process of healing past trauma that they don't remember? Is recovering these memories absolutely neccessary? I am currently reading 'The Body Keeps the Score'  and hearing about people experiencing flashbacks has me absolutely terrified. I have very intense nightmares but they are pretty abstract. I want to heal so badly but I am so, so scared of making myself worse off than I am now. I don't want to remember.

81,Potential Childhood Trauma - Is this Valid?,"This contains topics of eating disorders, child abuse, prolonged dissociation, and more mental health topics

I've struggled a lot with my mental health and have been in therapy on and off for the past four years and have been going consistently for a while now.  I recently have been reflecting a lot on my relationship with my mom and was wondering if this experience is enough to count as traumatizing, or if anyone can relate.

A bit of a disclaimer: I know for a fact that my parents love me and are trying their best.  My mom was abused, physically and emotionally, by her mother and has never gotten help for the trauma she endured.  Because of that, she never had a good example of what a good mother should be, so I don't entirely blame her for all of this, but she's still caused a lot of issues for me in my life.

Okay, now to actually get to the point.  I am going to divide this by section for organization.

EARLY CHILDHOOD  
My mom has always had a short temper.  I remember when I was a kid being a little scared of her.  She would never do anything, just yell, but it would sometimes be over tiny things.  Mistakes I hadn't even realized I had made.  Very rarely did I misbehave or disobey her intentionally, yet I got yelled at a lot.

ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE  
It got worse in middle school.  She became very obsessed with my academic performance.  I was worried to get anything lower than an A on assignments, tests, and other schoolwork.  If I did, she would say it was because I wasn't putting enough effort in, even though I would cry from the stress from studying for hours on end.  High school is when it got a lot worse.  I had a decently big friend group in late middle school, but due to various circumstances (people moving away, people becoming toxic, etc), had very few friends at school starting high school.  I thankfully had just started doing theatre at a local youth theatre, and was loving it.  It was the thing that kept me going.  Even though I never expressed this to my mom, she knew this.  Yet, apparently my grades started slipping freshman year of high school.  I had all A's (mostly A+'s), so I am not even sure how, but my mom was unhappy with my academic performance and regularly threatened to pull me out of theatre.  She said that she just wanted me to try my best, but when I explained that I *was*, she didn't believe me.

EATING AND BODY IMAGE  
Around this time also started her comments about my body.  At the time, I was probably about 4'11 and weighted 110 pounds?  That's my best guess.  I was a size 4 in dresses.  But when it came time for Prom (my school was small, so Prom was for all of high school), my mom commented about how I ""should"" be a smaller size, specifically a 0 or maybe a 2.  My mom struggled with anorexia when she was around my age (I am 20 now).  She has physically recovered, but definitely not emotionally.  She is now a bit overweight, and is very insecure about it.  She has made comments about her body in front of me since I was fairly young.  Anyways, the comments about my body started getting more frequent.  I was gaining weight (still very healthy though), which is normal at that age.  I remember the summer before sophomore year, I found out I was going to need surgery on both of my ankles.  She told me that I should start working on losing weight in advance since I would be ""sitting around"" a lot.  I tried, but I have a very low metabolism, making it very hard for me to lose weight.  I continued gaining weight throughout high school.  By junior year, I absolutely hated my body.  I was a healthy weight, 5'1 and approximately 125 lbs.  I thought I was overweight due to my mom's comments and body dysmorphia.  She started telling me that I should motivate myself to lose weight by putting pictures of cute clothes that I couldn't wear (because they would be unflattering) on my mirror (for context: I was still fairly skinny, and definitely a healthy weight at this point).  I have continued to gain weight since then and am now slightly overweight.  I regularly engage in disordered eating habits now (working on getting better though!) and have found her rewarding me for ""trying to be healthy.""  She also would call me lazy, blaming my weight gain on that.  I remember one specific time at a restaurant we were told it would be a few minutes for a table, so I sat down on the provided bench.  She instantly started talking about how lazy I was, how I ""was so lazy \[I\] couldn't even stand for a few minutes.""

TRYING TO FIND FAULTS  
I have felt for a long time that my mom has *tried* to find faults in me.  Especially in high school.  My mom likes shopping a lot, and sometimes she would wake me up in the morning on a weekend to tell me that we were going to spend the day shopping.  I usually got some nice stuff out of it, so please note that I am not trying to sound ungrateful.  Every one of these days, without fail, my mom would get mad at me for something.  One time she told me I ""didn't care about her"" because when she asked me where I wanted to eat, I didn't say the place she suggested (because they had no food I liked, which she knew).  Apparently, it was the only thing that sounded good to her.  We ended up not even getting dinner.  I think she made me something later that night, but I don't really remember (I was probably about 11?).  It was stuff like this constantly.  I felt like I could never do anything right.  After a while, I noticed that I always felt like I was going into ""autopilot"" on these days.  It really scared me at the time, but I have since learned that it's dissociation.  My dissociation has gotten significantly worse, and I am now, on some level, dissociated more often than not.

Anyways, she also would get REALLY upset with my cleaning sometimes.  My mom is a VERY tidy person.  She hates clutter.  I have ADHD (undiagnosed until I was 17, right at the end of high school) and have always struggled with keeping a neat room.  She would sometimes tell me to clean my room, but it would take me hours because I would get distracted.  She would get really mad.  There was one time that I had started laundry but had forgotten to switch loads, and she was extremely mad at me.  I remember her yelling at me, saying that I didn't care about her or anything she did for me.  She said I was ungrateful and that I didn't love her.  I tried to apologize, but she said I was faking it.  I started crying and then she yelled at me for crying.  This was a semi-regular occurrence.  Another time, when she yelled at me for something very similar, my dad tried to calm her down a bit and I overheard her tell him that, if he talked to me, I was going to start crying so that I could be the ""victim.""  From that day on, I made efforts not cry in front of my parents during stuff like that.  (For context: I was a HUGE crier for most of my life.  Every emotion was expressed through tears, so me crying was not a necessarily surprising or significant thing.  I now rarely cry, feeling genuinely unable to even when I am really emotionally distressed).  I cannot tell you the amount of letters I have drafted to my parents apologizing for being a terrible daughter on those nights.  I would cry as I apologized for making their lives harder and for being a disappointment.  I never gave them to them, though, knowing my mom would probably think it was a manipulation tactic.  In late high school, I started desperately wishing I had never been born because I felt like I made their lives worse.  She also told me right before college that ""\[my\] roommates were going to hate me"" because I wasn't neat enough, knowing that I was terrified of my roommates not liking me.  She apologized for that comment quickly, but it still sticks with me even now.

When I was a senior in high school, I joined the Cheer team and had to get a physical exam at the doctor's.  At the appointment, they had me fill out a mental health questionnaire.  I panicked a bit, and decided to answer semi-honestly (my goal was to not completely lie, but not admit the severity of what I was experiencing, as I had gone through great lengths to hide my mental health issues from everyone).  This was unsuccessful, though, and they still said that I should see a counselor.  They proceeded to read my answers aloud and ask for confirmation that that was my opinion... with my mom in the room.  There was a question about feeling like a disappointment to your family or something, and I said that I agreed.  In the car after the appointment, my mom proceeded to get mad at me, particularly regarding that question.  I have always done well in school and have been considered a responsible, hard-working, and high-achieving person.  I knew my mom was proud of my accomplishments.  She would tell her friends about them and praise me for them.  She proceeded to say something along the lines of ""You think we're not proud of you?  I don't know what more we can do to show you.""  I tried to explain that it wasn't her fault, that it was a ""me"" thing, but she wasn't hearing it.  She proceeded to blame my issues on my phone.

Sometimes my mom just... kind of insults me?  If she doesn't like my outfit she'll go ""oh interesting,"" when I make a change to my appearance and express that it makes me happy (such as a haircut) she will mention how she ""liked my \[former hair\] more"", and other things like that.  They would always be unprompted.  This went on for years and she knew it made me insecure.  One day, I finally asked her to stop doing that.  I asked that if she had a negative opinion about something, especially my appearance, if she could not mention it unless I asked for her opinion.  She proceeded to say that ""I get offended by everything that is not explicitly a compliment"" and ""I guess \[she's\] not allowed to have opinions anymore"".  She did end up apologizing for this, but it stuck with me.  It made me nervous to confront her about anything in the future.

ANYWAYS that was super super long, thank you for anyone who actually took the time to read all of that.  I wanted to clarify that I actually have a somewhat decent relationship with my mom.  For every bad memory there is, there's a good one.  We have a lot of common interests and have fun together a lot.  I know she loves me and doesn't mean to hurt me, but it doesn't change the fact that she does.  This is always there, nagging at me.  It's gotten a LOT better since I have been at college, but I still notice a lot of it affecting me now.  Is this enough to qualify as trauma?  And can anyone relate?

Edit: Treating Adult Survivors of Emotional Abuse and Neglect: Component-Based Psychotherapy, Hopper et al, 2019, page 5  


The thing is, this is a rather comprehensive list and I relate to nothing here. Even if I stretch the facts, the worse I can get is my parents were a little helicopter and were more demanding as far as grades than most of my colegues at school. But it is a hell of an unfair stretch. Still, the fact remains that it is pretty clear I have trauma symptoms. I am very insecure, have a very imature emotional development, have no skill on setting boundries, have a major rejection sensitive dysphoria, and I am the one that got it easy. My brother clearly suffers from CPTSD, again with no traumatic event whatsoever. I have good and clear memories of my childhood, most of them real, a fairly large number of false memories of completely benign nature. My impression is my brother only got so worse because he did so much therapy, but clearly I have no scientific basis for that, just the general impression that we started more or less the same and this would be the only major difference. Anyone knows other cases like this? Anyone knows if this is common? Most important, anyone knows of possible ways to get out of the mess?

100,manifestations of trauma,"i have manifestations of trauma that affect my daily life and i didn’t want to believe it. i recently got cognitive testing done and the memory loss and confusion i’ve been experiencing for years seems to be from trauma, my cognitive abilities, memory and processing speed tested to be completely fine. i’ve gotten cardiac assessments because of my tachycardia but my heart is perfectly fine, always being in a physical stress response has been affecting my heart rate and resting heart rate.

this is gonna sound really bad but a part of me hoped there was something wrong with my physical body as the alternative is that trauma has caused these symptoms and more. to me that feels so violating and it makes me feel sick. i can feel all this weight in my body, like this over abundance of energy yet im exhausted.

i don’t know where to go from here? the amount of psychological support i need is too expensive and unavailable for me to access and my mental health continues to get worse and i continue to lose my grip on reality and i feel so angry that people can just do the things they did to me, at the time i was a child, and not even blink an eye at it.

if you are experiencing anything like this im sorry, it’s more than unfair and no one should treat a child so badly that they have to live life anything like this.",1702641152.0,False,2,0,loaf413,None,18iyec2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/18iyec2/manifestations_of_trauma/
101,The trauma does not control me. ,"Bit of context: 

When I was a lotto girl (from age 5 - 16) I was starved by my step mum. Yes she fed me BUT it was constantly beans on toast which I told her day in day out I hate. I even said I’ll have just toast but that was “a faff”. She told me that I’d learn to like it (never did and still hate them). That or we’d get a pizza, there was 3 of us. My sister (eldest) would get 3 slices, brother (middle) would get 2 and I’d be left with 1. We weren’t allowed drinks past 8PM, to the point I was drinking out of the dogs water bowl so I didn’t get caught. 

At 16 I moved in with my mum (she left when I was 3 and came back). There I then WOULDNT eat because I was scared to. Wouldn’t drink because I was afraid of being shouted at. Etc. 

I was eating the tiniest things such as a handful of grapes. It then turned into me using my pocket money to ram myself full of chocolate and hide the remains of it. I was 16 and weighed 6.5 stone. No one cared or understood how bad that was. 

I’m now 19, moved in with my partner of 2 years. Finally got a good relationship with food (still struggle sometimes but it’s a lot better). I also found my love for cheffing so I’m a commie chef with my partner being a head chef, I’ve got a little one on the way and I’m currently on a mission to retry the foods that scared me. 

I made soft boiled eggs this morning and I actually really liked them!!😊

The closest thing I can compare this to is trauma bonding.

103,I have a fear of intimacy and rejection trauma. A lot of trauma. How do I get over it mentally and physically.,"I need advice on a fear of intimacy problem. And a lack of self worth because of rejection traumas

Also 21 male if age and life experience is a thing you consider 

For context you can look at my profile, when I met a girl in r dating advice.

I thought about it the past days and I realised, because of past trauma from girls rejecting me, my head was full with.

 ( she is taller then me she probably doesn't like me )

(I shouldn't risk it I like this person and don't want to ruin the relationship)

( We are probably too different she has I dinamic life and I don't)

I just realised she wanted to kiss me, and I accidentally rejected her, because I wanted to tell her something.

Forgot her number because I was given fake profiles or even just ghosted.

One time a girl just grabbed my phone gave me her profile and ghosted me I don't know why no words

I am usually a good judge of character and don't really like a lot of people for different reasons the moments like this week where I meet this special someone really hits hard

I don't really have any dating experience never kissed or done more (It doesn't really bother me I don't really care)

But it does contribute when I like someone having anxiety

All the girls I like where either taken and the ones that liked me I rejected causing this sort of not missing out but what if feeling

I have a lot of regrets because of that but because of this realisation I don't really regret meeting that girl she helped me even if I don't ever see her again she was just nice

104,I feel like my trauma’s aren’t traumatic enough,"Hey, sorry for the weird title. I just need to vent a little.
So I’ve been working on my mental health for a while now and I feel like I’ve been making progress. One of my problems however, is that every time I want to open up to people I feel like I’m just nagging about something thats not even that bad.
I made a realization about myself recently, that I hate getting the silent treatment because it literally makes me feel the most alone. 
It makes me want to hurt myself, 
and sometimes I do.
But the point is that I feel like I’m going through all of this out of privilege. The privilege of never been abused physically or sexually. That it could’ve been so much worse but it never got that far.
I wonder how other people deal with these thoughts, other’s who’ve been in a lot more danger as a kid or have a much severe case of CPTSD than mine. I wonder if the severity of their traumas makes their feelings valid.
I just feel like I’m overreacting. Like it wasn’t bad at all, I’m just making it too big for myself.
I’m mature enough to realize that this is just me projecting my abusers’ thought patterns, but I still can’t help it.

106,Trust issues and childhood trauma (advice?),"For context my parents are the root of these issues. They’re both manipulative, narcissistic, alcoholic, and lack emotionally intelligence. I lived with my mother for the most part of my life and felt so unwanted as a child. She provided for me as a caretaker but definitely not emotionally as a mother or any parent should. I’ve always felt like a burden to everyone and have always tried to make my presence smaller. All of my childhood trauma from not only both my parents but my surrounding family from both sides led to me  having low self esteem, trust issues, bottled in my emotions for years, and have terrible coping mechanisms. So I struggle a lot with processing emotions and communicating my feelings to others. 

So I’ve been seeing my therapist for about a year now and the thing is I’m in college and I go to school and live with my best friends. I’ve been friends with these girls since elementary/middle school. They’re very good friends of mine, some of my only actual friends I would say. In therapy we are working on emotions and my therapist asked me who do I talk to when I’m not in her office. To which I answer no one. I know it’s a problem because like I said I bottle everything in and when I do reach my breaking point it’s a complete shit show a disaster to say the least. I’m trying to work on that but it’s so hard to trust people, I even have a hard time trusting some of my only friends that have been nothing but good to me. I have never once told them anything about my childhood trauma, my shitty parents, my mental health, etc. I joke about it but I haven’t never fully spoken about anything and actually laid my feelings out on the table. 

My therapist told me that I should start small and in a safe space with people that I feel loved by. Which would be my friends, but I’m having such a hard time trying to figure out how to even go about it and tell them what’s going on. I know I’m going to burst into tears and I have a thing where I don’t like people to see me cry. I feel weak when other people see me cry. They’ve only seen me cry a few times in the many years we have been friends and one instance was involuntary because I was drunk. Other than that I have never once opened up to them about my true feelings or let them see me so vulnerable. I’m so scared to let them see that side of me. I don’t know why I think that they’ll hate me or not want to be friends with me. But I know that they’re not like that at all. My friends are good to me and they care, but something in my brain tells me differently. It’s so fucked. 

How can I even begin to tell the people I trust the most in my life about what is going on? If I can’t tell my friends who I feel safe around and loved by, how will I be able to talk about my feelings and stand up for myself with strangers or other people that I’m not super close to. Hell, even my family??? How would I even start that conversation?

108,Is this Sibling Abuse / Trauma?,"Trigger: Physical violence, abuse

Sorry this is a little long 

When I was younger, my sibling was very very aggressive. It started when I was 6/7, so when they were first starting preschool and ended after they got medicated + diagnosed autistic + stopped talking to them when I was 17. I'm 20 now, they're 17.  Before school days they would often scream, cry, hit, and sometimes curse at my parents for trying to make them go to school as I was waiting for the bus. This made me late sometimes and was an embarrassment. Sometimes it was daily and I went to school like everything was normal. I thought it was normal. During play if they got angry they would hit and scratch (which sometimes drew blood they had very long nails). I would have to defuse the situation, they would get told to go into their room where they would proceed to stomp as loud as they could and slam the door, or I had to run. If i ran I would run into my room and lock it behind me. They would bang and scream at my door trying to get me. If they got to me before my door was locked I would have to push to keep it closed or hold my doorknob. They would get sent to their room and scream and cry loudly while I tried to self soothe and cry quietly by myself. I stopped coming out of my room to play when I was 10.

When I was 13, I moved downstairs. This room didn't have any locks on the door and breaking into my room to get me still happened. I had to hold it closed. Sometimes this happened with friends over. During some particularly bad instances I got cornered and had to hit to get them away from me. I've only hit them a couple of times and it was always self defense. They hit me with a cup which obviously stung like a b, and I think they knew because they threatened me with it when I said something they didn't like. They've chased me around and attempted to choke me/ suffocate me on my bed. I was able to kick them off. I am so thankful I am older and stronger.

I think I'm what people call a glass child? I was the 'perfect kid' and never got in trouble, got good grades, never asked for what I needed, barely asked for help, etc all because my parents struggled with my sibling. They still do take most of my parents attention and recourses and I get most of the attention I need from people online. I take care of myself. I remember looking up sibling abuse when I was younger and there was no actual criteria or experiences written online so I just thought every sibling relationship was like this until I started talking to others. Most of it was diminished as just normal sibling fights. Even still, maybe it's not as bad as I make it out to be.

I am constantly annoyed and angry at my sibling. I don't want to be related to them. I jump and struggle to keep myself grounded when people scream, slam things (especially doors) and fight. I struggle in relationships and have a disorganized attachment style.

For those of you that are readers, how do you handle reading really good books with characters you identify with that then go through hard times that essentially remind you of your trauma? I find myself both.. almost craving that emotional experience since I feel so cold normally but also being like.. retraumatized or at least stuck ruminating on things later. Like I feel stuck being retrospective in a way that I do think is helpful, but also harmful some times. It's like I just empathize with the characters too much. A lot of the times, it's even just empathizing with the characters once they have been so beaten down they are broken. \^\^; It's not necessarily how they got there. In the stories of course, they tend to have a come back and these feel almost healing to me. It gives me hope almost and makes me feel things I hadn't felt in a long time again. At the same time though, it can plunge me into some pretty nasty depression too.

121,Is this emotional abuse and trauma?,"I think that my family is toxic or has become since my father acquired a brain injury working as a senior electrical engineer. I am 26 years old, and just finished graduating as a RN. I have been trying to be understanding from various points of views and consider the trauma and hardships that each of my family members is experiencing, often putting myself last. My father is disabled and its difficult for him to control his emotions and extremely impulsive. My mother has an unhealthy obsession with money and materialistic things that she craves to escape the reality we live in. My brother is sadistic and displaying narc traits, he stays home and plays video games. My sister has severe mental and physical health problems and cptsd. I have been trying non-stop to provide rational and sense to them, telling them right from wrong. My sister had developed a bad addiction to benzos that went on for years and just last year after finishing my placement I addressed this and her co-dependency. I think out of all of my family members, my sister hurts me the most. Towards the end of 2023, I was with her even whilst completing my unpaid placement trying to support her, even jeopardising my own completition of my degree. I was there for her as best as I could, and stayed quiet when she argued with me late at night after coming home from placement. Took her to emergency, and stayed and when she wanted to leave we left. I was doing my best to be there for her, whilst also trying to take care of my dad's things and mum. Because they do not realize the value of money, I spent weeks trying to find out what they were doing and turns out my father considering his cognitive deficiencies, was giving money to strangers using his retirement income and making these plans that made no sense. Eg. I had to drive them to have a look at this land that was 4 hours away from civilisation, and with my father telling me that he has plans of building a medical centre. I stopped this from happening, and took the deposit money away, and explained to this elderly man who also seemed to have impaired capacity to make sound decisions that my father does not have a sound mind to be making a 700000 decision and it was not happening. I begged my mum to return back to my country for the time being as this was a bad timing for my sister. Both of my parents refused. I begged them to be cautious of how much they were spending, I tried sitting down calmly and explaining it to them, I tried drawing every method you could think of before it came to yelling and throwing things out of anger. I've held and coped everything from 3 people, and the worst has been my sister who I have given all of the money to and tried to maintain contact just to get news from her.  During my parents being back at home, my sister immediately fled and I helped her. I had to stay because of my dog, and I did, also was the fact that I obviously had nowhere to go and not in the financial position to be even considering moving elsewhere. The lack of understanding for one another and the continuing emotional and mental abuse really pushed me to the edge. My parents placing money over anything or anyone and my father alone placing strangers in front of his children, is beyond my comprehension.

128,Please can someone explain what trauma is? (Possible TW),"I'm so confused rn.

I've been seeing a therapist recently, and she says I've got trauma due to my anxiety disorder impacting me severely + my parent's divorce.

For context, here's the things she says makes it 'trauma':

1. I'm constantly on edge, can't relax anywhere, having loads of panic attacks, immediately wary of anyone I don't know, etc.
2. Apologising profusely and thinking everything's my fault.
3. Going silent and sort of freezing when people argue.
4. In a similar vein as No. 3, having a panic attack when people raise their voices/have an argument.

I could list more stuff, but you get the idea.

However, I'm really struggling to understand this, because I was under the impression that 'trauma' is a result of an actually serious situation, like war or rape, etc.

I've had a perfectly normal, middle-class upbringing.

I don't have trauma, right?

I don't want to wrongly think that I do and take away from people who actually have it and struggle.

Oh and on top of that I have ADHD which was diagnosed early on but no one cared.  I only add this because I've never shared it with anyone and figured it would be better insight as to why I have the issues I'm struggling with.

135,Trauma from being the abuser,"I know it sounds ridiculous - but I was abusive to my sister and I live with the guilt and the pain every single day. 

I grew up in a messy household, where people scream at each other instead of talking like normal people. It was normal for us to get hit all the time - mom was physically abusive and was very controlling. Dad was alcoholic and addicted to gambling. Growing up, my only goal was to do what mom wants,  or else I’d get a beating. Despite that, I know in my heart she loves us. When I asked her why she does it, she says her mother does the same and it’s discipline. 

I consider myself as a decent person. I love animals, and I love people deeply. I would easily die for family or my dogs. I am generous and very giving. Yet, I’m abusive. At least to my younger sister. 

My younger sister was born when I was maybe around 12 years old. My mom had her with another man, and she was introduced to us as my cousin’s daughter. I felt the instant connection and loved her from the first time I saw her. At first, I was kind to her, like I am to everyone, especially siblings and relatives. But my mom and my cousin were abusive to her. They would hurt her over petty things, scream at her all the time telling her she’s worth nothing. I felt so bad for her and felt so helpless I wanted to say something but was scared of my mom too. 

Over the years, I started being abusive to her too. I would scream at her, tell her all kinds of abusive words, and physically hurt her like pulling her hair, kicking her, hitting her with anything. It’s almost like I get so angry sometimes that I couldn’t control myself. As I was hurting her, I would feel remorse and guilt and shame, and pain and hatred for myself. Yet, that didn’t stop me from hurting her over and over again.. for so many years. 

It’s not always hurting though. There are times when I would show her I love her, and tell her even. But I know it doesn’t mean a thing. How could you hurt someone you love? Poor girl grew up thinking she was my cousins’s, then found out she’s my sister, yet mom doesn’t like her and was so mean to her. 

This abuse continued for years - and only stopped when my mom decided to send her away and have her live in the province with a relative as a punishment for having friends that were not “good”. I love her so much and was sad, but was also relieved that she’ll be away from us, from people who’s supposed to love her yet abused her. 

As soon as she’s away, I heard she started having more friends and being more like her own person, not a persona my mom forced onto her, or us. But I know she must be traumatized by what we did to her. She must be wondering why we did what we did and said what we said. 

Every single day I live with the guilt and pain. Everythign triggers the memory of me hurting her, and each time I remember, I want to end myself. I cant find it in me to be happy in life because I feel like I don’t deserve it. I don’t deserve happiness for doing what I did. I don’t understand why I did it either. I just know I get so angry sometimes that I cant contain it. 

My sister still sends me messages sometimes and tells me she misses me and she looks up to me. It breaks my heart. This poor soul was probably never showed love yet she still looks up to me? This makes me feel all kinds of things. Guilt. Shame. Hatred. Sadness. Confusion..

I am 30 now and don’t have a good relationship with my mother. I hate her for what she did to us. To my sister especially. I hate her for being controlling and manipulative, but I also hate myself for hating her. How could I? She’s my mother. I have just accepted the fact that even if I don’t get happiness, it’s probably just payment for what I did years ago. Even then, it will never be enough. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest. Im just really confused and angry at myself for even feeling this way. I feel like I don’t even have the right to feel sad and pain, because after all I was an abuser. 

My only wish is for my sister to be happy and not be haunted by those years - although I think it’s not likely for her not be affected by what she went through. I wish I could sell my soul to the devil just to ensure that she lives a happy life, surrounded by people she loves and people who love her.",1704769810.0,False,1,0,Appropriate-Bid-7685,None,1924fku,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1924fku/trauma_from_being_the_abuser/

But despite not going through any traumatic events, I've always felt a little ""off"" in a bad way. Like, mentally, I felt like I had some kind of a problem, but I just couldn't tell what.

143,How can I stop feeling competitive with others’ trauma,"I feel really ashamed and guilty about this, and I know it makes me a pretty awful person, so please don’t judge me too much, I am trying to improve on this.

The other day, I found out that the guy I’ve started dating has a mum who’s had cancer twice. I’ve struggled with mental health for years, but the last few months I’ve been feeling almost cured. And then this one little thing has sent me back to square one - I have this pit of dread in my chest, I feel sick, I can’t focus, I feel suicidal / like hurting myself, I actually feel like I’m losing my mind, the feeling is consuming me I feel like I can’t function. And it’s just because the idea of someone else having struggled with something triggers me so bad. It makes me feel like I HAVE to prove that I have struggled as well. I’m constantly trying to justify my struggles, and as soon as I find out that someone has had it worse I lose my shit. I feel like I have to find a way in which I’ve had it worse. I even fantasise about awful things happening to me, and finding a way to make them happen, so I would feel like I deserve to struggle, and so that I would be the one who’s had it worse. It’s so stupid, like my logical mind knows it’s ridiculous, and honestly disgusting that I would almost envy someone for almost losing their mum, like how much of a shit person do you have to be. I hate myself so so much for it. But I just can’t help it, I want so badly to get rid of it but I can’t, I’ve been trying for years and I thought I might’ve gotten over it, but it seems not. 

For reference, I had some issues, mostly from the age of about 13 (19 now), with a variety of different people being emotionally manipulative (a lot of emotional blackmail and threats / being made fully responsible for peoples’ severe mental health issues from a young age / gaslighting e.g into thinking I’d be raped & abused / etc.), but all of these people were just close friends, not family or partners, so it seems silly to have let it affect me this badly, like I wouldn’t class it as trauma, it was just upsetting at the time. But I have to assume that these feelings are resulting from that. Which feels a bit pathetic but oh well.

I really want it to work out with this guy, and I don’t want me not being able to handle my triggers to ruin it. I also know that there’s a chance of this making me toxic - I feel so guilty saying this, but I know that if something happened like his mum getting cancer again, I know that would make me freak out so bad and I would struggle to be there for him like I should be. 

If anyone can relate it would make me feel so much better, and if anyone knows how to get rid of this feeling it would be much appreciated. 

Edit: Should probably have made clear that I would never actually act on these impulses by saying something stupid and unsympathetic, or offloading on someone or something, I can keep it under control in that sense.

145,Are these related to possible trauma?,"Context: Underage, M,
I struggle to have lasting relationships with girls, those who would do anything for me and loved me, I may vent or come off as weird sometimes and talk bad to them when they start liking me. Only after they have left do I realize that I self sabotage myself, I don’t trust very easily.
I also have a problem with needing to be perfect, which coupled with my ADHD makes me set high expectations which are frequently not met making me feel like i’m a loser, which influences my mind daily.
When I am alone I also think someone is after me and at night I fear that someone may break in.
I have problems with self confidence which result in me putting on a narcissistic persona which ruins the relationships that may get built. (SH warning) I have had cut, stabbed myself and OD on benzo + alcohol. I would do anything to go back in time to restore some relationships I had fucked up.
I hardly feel “happy” I live mainly in the past and the future, only focusing on the present limited times. I mainly think about how to make my expectations come true and procrastinate on them.

146,Recovering from trauma and severe depression,"I had the need to post this because I'm feeling stronger and happier than never today. I am a CSA survivor and I had severe issues with depression, anxiety and ptsd. You can hear my history in another post I made in this sub.

Last week was my lowest point ever. I spent the whole week having panic attacks and flashbacks of abuse at all time(work, home etc.), but now I just managed to calm down and analyze the situation. I made a mental schedule of everything I want to change and the most important: I convinced myself that what happened was never my fault and I can recover control of myself and it depends only on me. 

To anyone struggling with similar questions, it's important to know you can't change past, but future you can for sure. The way you're feeling today doesen't determine how you'll feel tomorrow. It takes time and not gonna lie, changes hurt, but are necessary.

If I would describe how it feels to have hope after being abused, I would say it's like a part of HPatDH I read in my teenage, when Harry is being carried through an horde of dementors but the conscience of being alive and having the opportunity of facing Voldemort is stronger than them, despite being many and him being fully aware they are there.",1703217278.0,False,1,3,Natanael329,None,18o5ufu,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/18o5ufu/recovering_from_trauma_and_severe_depression/
147,Overcoming motorbike crash trauma,"F29 - medications daily - sertraline, amitriptylene, propranalol 

I had a motorbike accident a month ago, long  story short, it was my fault, lost control of the bike, hit two cars and slid down road. I have a broken collarbone and severe bruising / swelling on legs. I don’t remember anything in between losing control and then trying to get up. I am slowly healing. 

Some nights I can’t sleep because I can’t believe it happened to me, I’ve never had a crash before. I know I should feel lucky to be alive but I just feel guilt and embarrassment. I have flashbacks of the crash and the day in hospital. I can’t remember most of it but apparently this is my brain protecting me. Some days I don’t even think about it and some nights I don’t sleep at all. I don’t really have anyone to talk to that has also been in a serious accident like mine. I have very supportive family around me but no one really gets it.

I remember thinking I’m about crash, I remember closing my eyes and then waking up on the road, I just feel horrible thinking that I just closed my eyes and didn’t try to stop? All of the witnesses said they saw my bike wobbling and I must have hit something on the road. But I feel like what if I just gave up in that moment and thought this is it? 

It’s really scary. I could have died that day and I feel somewhat guilty or afraid that I survived, it’s hard to explain.

152,Past Traumas & Guilt Trap | Give Suggestions ,"Hey,
I believe that I too face the same issue. Here is what I have realised.

1. My past life trama. My parents are all good and great, but sometimes I do feel that I am navie. It's not because I am not mature, it's because of the social conditioning I grew up in.

2. I went to an elite school in my childhood, everything went right till my first grade. Then it started, gaslighting, ignoring and making me feel as the wrong doer when I wasn't.

That broke my self-esteem and I was too innocent to understand the people around me.

3. I am male and one of my classmate *pushed* the ideas of NSFW at my grade 3. I was too innocent to understand it and developed an wrong POV.

4. By my 7-8 grade I realised the environment and all the cunningness and changed myself.

5. But by my 10th Grade, I was into NSFW because of the damage the other person has made, which further developed into sexting.

6. I got out of it at times, everything seems perfect and fine and I would have overcome it. But to be drawn back to it into the deep pitfall.

7. I do struggle with this, since it's not my fault. I didn't develop the wrong POV at the first place. Someone else did.

8. Recently, someone in public transport mis-behaved with me. I told them to stop but they didn't. I wasn't even able to tell the incharge as the person was of incharge was female.

All these insecurities and past traumas built an guilt trap into me.

9. My classmate now in University, most of them talk NSFW as if it's the coolest thing to do. Again, it kindles my past traumas.

10. This lead me to do sexting again with more regrard and guilt in end.

153,Coping with trauma,"I hate using the word ""victim"" because I feel like it reduces me to some kind of stereotype, but I feel like when I'm corralled into a situation where I feel blackmailed or forced that it just fills me with this irrational rage and then depression and helplessness.

This is anything from someone oblivious passing in front of me and forcing me to slam on my brakes to a landlord telling that if I want him to fix something on his property, I have to pay for it (even though the problem was preexisting), to a work manager telling me that in return for confiding in him that someone on the team isn't working their tickets, upper management has elected to terminate my employment.

When I write it out, it sounds completely ridiculous, like I'm someone who feels like all landlords are the problem or that corporations are the reason I don't have a house yet. 

But it's not like that for me.

How do adults handle being bullied? Or being treated like they don't deserve a civilized amount of consideration? Like you're not enough to be treated like an equal because it's easier for the other party to make you feel molested rather than looking at it objectively and doing the right thing.

I'm hoping to find some useful advice here, even if it is the Internet.

154,Is this a trauma response or am I dramatic?,"I had a breakdown yesterday and today about getting a root canal tomorrow (maybe, the dentist won't know for sure until they start working on my teeth). The part I'm most worried about is the shots, I have a bad history when it comes to shots, especially at the dentist. Some more context is that I have autism and very sensitive. I also have a vasovagal response and have fainted many times when it came to shots, piercings, and especially blood draws (I most likely to faint the second the needle goes in for blood draws). I am also sensitive to lather and foam (makes me gag) so you can imagine brushing my teeth was hell for nearly 20 years, I got diagnosed at 19.

I had to get cavities filled in three times and each time was horrible. The first time when I was 16/17 I was told that it was not a shot (after I told them I was a faint risk) and just a spray and that they would give me nitrous oxide, but they waited ten minutes after stopping the gas and I felt everything. I'm sure I cried but luckily didn't faint. The next time, I had to argue with the dentist, who told me that I was an adult and when they gave it to me, I still felt a lot of pain, and when I told they could not give me anymore due to my size (I am a small person).  The third time, I was told that they don't offer it to adults and I didn't feel like arguing. I ended up fainting and the first thing I hear is 'oh her chart is flagged as a faint risk'. They didn't even look at my chart before giving me the shots.

Moving on to the one tomorrow, this is a new dentist and they seem much better than the last few. They said no problem for the gas, which is a relief, but I'm still scared. I had a really bad breakdown yesterday and when the dentist called again today, I had to leave work early because I'm still crying on and off 5 hours later. I thought I was scared of getting a root canal, but I think I'm more scared of the shots.

158,Childhood trauma getting triggered in my personal life,"I have grown up in a surrounding where a lot of anxious thinking was involved. Almost all the conversations were filled with trust issues, anxious perceptions on perfectly normal people, overthinked decisions etc. This was not something that I had within me but in the people, mostly adults around me. I was always wise enough to filter out all of these negativity and keep my life vibrating at a different frequency from them, at the same time accepting them for who they are and for their thinking capacity. My sibling and I have an amazing bond and that’s the main reason we were able to separate our spirituality from what was going on around us. Because of this atmosphere and what we have been witnessing, we both got educated a lot on how people’s thinking work. That’s through self research, talking etc. 

But little did I know, no matter how much I understood, my thinking pattern would go downhill in a similar path once I get into a relationship. I always had this tiny fear of me unknowingly applying those negative content in my life. But since I was aware of why things are the way they are, I was pretty confident that I would be able to handle it. But seems like I’m not fully in control of my mind even though I understand everything logically. I’m very sad and moody most of the time due to my assumptions on situations, how I look at things at the first glance, how I apply these on the people I love and trust the most. Most importantly, I feel very bad to look at my partner through a dark anxiety filled filter. It has almost become a daily struggle.

159,How do you get over trauma with no root cause?,"Literally since I can remember, I've struggled with intense physical symptoms of anxiety which lead to loss of appetite, and when the anxiety is particularly intense, I dry heave and vomit. My parents viewed it as me simply refusing to eat and didn't seek medical or psychological help. I would be forced to eat or be physically disciplined if I threw up. I would vomit almost everything, including foods I enjoyed, which made things difficult and led to a lot of anxiety around food in general. Despite this,I was able to eat regularly enough if they were “safe foods”, which I was used to eating. Attending boarding school at age 8, alleviated pressure as there were routine foods and I wasn’t forced to eat but the issue still continued.  
  
Today, my main struggle centres on restaurants and formal dining.They trigger me because restaurants meant more anger from my parents, more embarrassment for me, and an audience for what I was going through. Over time, my parents developed strategies for me like eating on an empty stomach, having water to wash down the food, and knowing beforehand where the bathrooms and exits are which helped and which I still use today.  
  
Despite managing to hide or control my nausea and vomiting most of the time, these strategies haven't fully resolved my issue. My main problem today arises with dating. Dating puts my anxiety at 100 which leads to my coping mechanisms being ineffective. I end up dry heaving even on an empty stomach. This is incredibly embarrassing and dysregulating. SO, I avoid dating altogether.  
  
My counsellor and I have tried to uncover the root cause of my issue, but without any success. By ""root,"" I mean the instance that initiated this whole problem. I tried to recall childhood memories but I simply can't recall the root; this is the only life I've known. I feel utterly powerless. My guess is that my brain linked food to anxiety due to early experiences, but it's only a guess. My parents haven't provided answers, leaving me guessing. I genuinely don’t know if I had a physical illness that turned mental or what. Any insight would be appreciated.  
  
Thanks for reading this  
  
Side Note: This behaviour isn’t linked with my body image, and I believe it is purely a result of anxiety.  
  
TLDR:  
I've dealt with intense anxiety symptoms since childhood, including losing my appetite and vomiting, especially in stressful situations like formal dining. This stems from childhood experiences where my parents forced me to eat and punished me for vomiting. These issues persist into adulthood, particularly affecting my dating life, as I struggle with intense physical symptoms during dates. Despite seeking counselling, we haven't been able to identify the root cause. I believe it's purely anxiety-related, unrelated to body image. Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated.

But when I am busy, working toward something like exams, projects, etc, or before my period comes, I get flashbacks of the past events, lose motivation for everything like showering, brushing teeth, and so on.

162,Depressed and anxiety from childhood trauma,"How do you get over emotional problems from childhood with mom? I'm feeling stressed and anxiety, have negative thought whenever she comes visit..

I'm 32F, living in the U.S and my mom is from Asia. My dad passed away when I was young. 
So you know Asian strict parents, they love us in their own way, but sometimes it's a little too much that leaving wounds even if we're adult. 

For example: 
- My mom barely talk to me when I was a kid/ teenager because she's too busy with work and leave me with my nanny
- My mom is super controlling when im in my teens: no dress up, no friends, no hang out with anyone. Literally im so alone and miserable on my teenager because of no friend, super low self esteem and just go to school and go home. I barely talk to anyone and people think that I have some kind of mental problem. 
- My mom has her favorite child (my elder brother) and always compliment him in front of people and it makes me feel invisible and not good enough . Until i'm 18, because my brother moved to the U.S away from her and I started to get her attention
- When I was a kid, she constantly snapped me if I do something not in her right way, no explanation! 
Even if it's something silly.. like I always remember she told me to put my toothpaste exactly the way she does (vertically). And I asked why can't I put it horizontally and she snapped: bitch just do what I said! 
- She always mentioned about how man is bad, all man cheated and tell story about cheating lying blah blah and tell me to watch out: you don't know your partner until they go to the grave 🫠
- Other stuffs like: no private room, no hugging, no apology cuz mom is always right (her excuse is she was borned before me) 


As a result, I developed a lot of issues. 
- Social anxiety, i don't like to make friends and feel like there's no need to have friends because mom also has no friends. She said people come to you when you have money and leave/ disrespect when you're poor. She just seek advices from old people. 
- I don't feel empathy for people and hardly express my emotions from years of being quiet and not expressing myself. I was numb and showing no facial expression when a friend lost a dog, or a roomate cry, or even when my husband surprised me on birthday, all I said was: who did this cake, it looks weird 🤣 
- Have an urge to do things my way, agaisnt my mom when she comes visit, i also don't let her go into my room because idk maybe it's the boundaries I never had. 
- When she's around I don't like my brother, I don't like him to be succeed because I feel like I want to be the spotlight not the shadow
- Affect my dating life: I was super control, jealous and always think about they are gonna cheat on me. Constantly need attention and affection

I feel like I must be fucked up or go crazy if I did not have some time in college that allowed me to stay away from her for 3 years and did whatever I wanted to do as a teenager, and married to my husband now. 
He actually being patient and give me the attention I need. Listen to my problem. For 3 years of marrying to him, I act like a kid when there's only 2 of us : huggin, cuddling, talk in a cute baby voice, express my thought, do things I love. I also started to develop feeling and emotions more when we adopt pets. I'm trying to heal myself and make good progress. 

However, whenever mom comes visit , she makes me feel uncomfortable and started to have negative thought again. Especially she told me to be careful with marriage because you never know your men until they go to the grave. I cried a lot after that behind her back. I feel like my husband is the only person that allow me to be myself and help me heal. And my mom doesn't see that. And other things just make me remember my childhood that hurts so bad. I still cry when I mention it to my husband. 

I couldn't tell her all these things because i would be ungrateful when she raised us as a single mom when she was young, and she's too stubborn to change. Whenever I started to say anything she will raise her voice and kinda get mad and say things like: imagine you raised 3 kids alone blah blah so that I won't say anything back. And I also love her so it's like a dilemma

The thing is I’m very well aware that this ‘falling in love’ thing with him was a trauma bond(daddy issues) I work so hard to heal and forgive past (early childhood) And it has been almost 8 months since we broke up. I have another boyfriend which I love. But I keep thinking about him it just still hurts me. I still miss him as well but I definitely don’t want him back to my life. The obsession or whatever I had for him feels like love but on the other hand I know it was the trauma bond. Knowing his truth as a whole and stilling loving him is crazy to me. I’m blaming my father after I feel the pain on my chest every time as well for a second. Like literally I just wanna heal and focus on my bf only. Why the hell is he still in my mind ? Helppp

167,How to deal with childhood trauma?,"Hello, firstly I apologize if there's any bad grammar.

15m bullying victim here. For the majority of my life I've been incredibly socially awkward and afraid of talking to people, the entirety of primary school (in my country around ages 7-15) I had basically no friends (mostly my own fault due to the aforementionted social awkwardness) and been bullied for no apparent reason that I recall. No one aside from my family and one close friend was ever really kind to me or wanted to talk to me, and now that I'm in technical school I changed my entire personality so that I would not have to relive the nightmare of being alone.

However, now that I've made some friends I constantly have feelings that when people are kind to me, they do so just to make fun of me, and everytime I try to brush off these thoughts, they keep coming back up. I also developed feelings of ''never being enough'' and I cannot escape the thoughts that keep telling me that I am pathetic and no matter how much I try to improve (diet, training, appearance, style, personality), it will bring no effect.

Worst of all, I still cannot stave of the social awkwardness and I'm still afraid of talking to new people, hoping that they approach me first.

What is there that I can do to become more confident and actually be able to talk to people?",1700958421.0,False,3,2,Ronguex,None,183xvp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/183xvp7/how_to_deal_with_childhood_trauma/
168,Need someone to listen - sudden trauma response,"So, this is so mundane but somehow triggered me. I bought some heatless curlers (the satin ones where you pin your hair and then curl the hair around the satin and sleep in it over night). Anyway, you're meant to tie your hair at the bottom in a scrunchie but well...I couldn't do it. Just wasn't working out. 

All of a sudden, after trying for an hour, my mind was like ""You can't do it because you're stupid"". Then I thought about how I only learned to tie my hair in a ponytail when I was 20 years old. 

For background, I had leukemia at 5-8 years old so lost all my hair. In primary school, I got asked a lot if I was a boy because I was bold (even though I was wearing dresses lol) and obviously missed out on this critical time of knowing how to style hair. Anyway, when I got older, I had short haircuts. Only in the past 7 years has my hair been at a length where it can be tied up, styled, etc. And now I can't do it. 

Anyway, after a panic attack and some crying, I'm now in a state of being super fragile and keep crying even though I'm not hypoventilating anymore.

170,Is this a trauma response,"I used to wear chokers. Actually weirdly a lot. In middle school, and it didn't irritated me as much it did today. 

I used to get bullied in middle school for lots of reasons, most of the same graders hated me and bullied me. But there was one main person who started it all, let's call him A. In sixth grade, A choked me. Like straight up slammed me to a wall and choked me with only one hand, that action took my by surprise and that moment i just laughed and said ""what will you gain by this?"". I was not scared of him, i know that for sure. After that, in seventh grade similar thing happened again, this time in the classroom near bunch of people + teacher. That one scared me more. And i panicked more than normal, no one did anything and teacher didn't took action. 

After these things, now I'm 18, i can't wear turtleneck sweaters and chokers. No matter how loose they are, if it's touching my neck, i feel panicked and i can't breathe properly. The sensation is not similar to choking, it's more like when you try to speak but there's something blocking you from it, like when you cry. And it's so irritating. It's same when i wear hoodies. I wear it and hoodie part it heavier it pulls the neckline closer to my neck, again making me feel panicked.

Its just a thought i've had as i've been struggling dealing with loss of a potential relationship. I am struggling to get over them. There wasn't any abuse that i'm aware of. Sometimes you need an outside perspective. We started talking at work, things were going well. Even gave him my number. He talked to me some personal stuff on the first phone call. Got in the wrong crowd that sort of thing. Some drug taking in the past. I did a lot of research, and thought this was a risk i was willing to take. 

He suddenly started getting distant and distracted.  (Im seeing it more now that I'm looking back) Cut off all contact with me. I think he was taking again, and been to rehab as his phone was off for the long time.

 Fast forward 4 months i got in contact again. Stupidly we never spoke about what had happened, my fault aswell. We had been speaking like ""old times"" for a few weeks. All was going well again, or so i thought. He lost his job and it all happened again. We haven't spoken since. 

The problem now is i can't stop thinking about him. How is he? where is he? is he ok? And if he gets in contact i probably will talk again, if I don't get in contact first of course 😔.

174,Painful OCD Headache Trauma Scars,"Hi, I have been dealing with something that seems like a mumble jumble of things and I have search Google and the web far and wide and have barely came to any real conclusion as to what I have. I literally suffer every day the pain is mild to extremely severe and it has made me so depressed and ashamed of my appearance. 

Because of the pain I endure and my thoughts and just random times the pain comes out of no where. I have these scars on my forehead. I feel completely and utterly ugly and was sadly suicidal a few months ago because of the pain. However, I believe in Jesus and I do not want to die. I want to die after a happy beautiful life on Earth. My condition makes literally no to yes, it does make sense. In that aspect I truly feel like I am dealing with tension headache’s, OCD, rumination, terrible terrible pain, PTSD, anxiety generalized disorder, and probably much more. This is self diagnosed. 

I really want to meet a therapist and get brain scans to finally figure out how to stop the goodness awful pain and the scars and find out what I have. I live in America and you should know how the healthcare system works here sadly. I have low income insurance and found out how to contact therapist, I contacted four via E-mail and sadly none have responded. I sent this about two weeks ago. If anyone has any tips or has similar experiences please comment. I want to feel better, like I’m not alone and that I will eventually heal and be super joyful and alive again. Helping others too. 

As for my OCD, the thought of abrupt change feels so out of place. Like, is it really me feeling this way . . ? But, it really feels like me. Even if it causes me pain and extreme discomfort. I have very inappropriate thoughts and when I ignore them the pain gets really bad. For some odd reason when I reassure myself with my thoughts and feelings. It somehow helps, but it doesn’t obviously last. To keep doing this every time I am in pain is atrocious. Hopefully a therapist is among the comments and can give me some professional advice and insight as to what you think this is. Truly this is horrible. I wish this upon no one.

175,Repressed childhood trauma? I have no idea,"Hello. I think I’ve posted here once before but I’m not a regular here. 

My question is kind of layered and weird but I definitely feel like I need help. I’ve been going through a pretty hard break up lately and it has caused me to interrogate why I interact with the world and people the way that I do. It’s also become clear to me that I am incapable of showing love for people in a healthy way, and it instead manifests as me trying to make sure they don’t leave me. 

Anyway I was talking to a therapist and also some friends about the situation and some of my friends seem to think I have some sort of repressed childhood trauma in my brain that I haven’t dealt with. I was trying to tell people about my upbringing but it quickly became clear that I can’t really remember anything about my upbringing aside from 5 or 6 core memories (which are all bad and like imprinted on my brain). My memory from birth until like after high school is just extremely bad. There are things that I know were happening to me (verbal and emotional abuse, rare physical abuse, one instance of sexual assault) but I can’t help but think that there’s something I’m repressing or not remembering at this point because my memory is so bad. 

I know I was a child of an extremely messy divorce, I know I was verbally abused and emotionally neglected but it just feels like there’s something else. Some kind of thing that has just been deleted or something. 

Idk, this is all probably incoherent but I guess what I’m asking is what can I do to try and remember so I can heal and form meaningful and healthy relationships with people? The way I interact with the world and people has been so affected by this that I have lost almost everyone and I just can’t live like this anymore.

But at that time i guess they thought i was stupid and couldn’t tell. But anyways ofc i’d leave the room after knowing they were doing that. Other times they’d lay on the same couch and have a blanket over them. One specific time, my mum was facing me and my step dad who was “pretending to be asleep” was laid next to her but covered by the blanket. And all i remember is asking if my mum was okay and why she wasn’t speaking and my step dad saying “leave mum alone, she’s sleeping” yet her eyes were open and she had kind of a blank stare but just wasn’t looking at me. And honestly just the way she was looking scares me and grosses me out for some reason but now being 19 i know something sexual was happening and for some reason it just comes to mind every now and again and seriously frustrates me because of how gross it was for them to be doing that while i was in the same room. I just see my mum’s face in the back of my head and it seriously does freak me out and i get seriously disgusted by it too. It also makes me feel angry towards my step dad for acting like he wasn’t doing shit. He didn’t know my mums eyes were open either since he was covered so that’s why he tried to make the excuse she was sleeping. I can’t mention it because this was a long time ago, i just want them to apologise i guess but i know that cant happen cos why would they.And i’d feel too awkward talking about that one situation. Also there’s certain porn videos i cant watch either because of this and it immediately turns me off. Idk what i want but i just wanted to know if me feeling like this is normal?

180,"My life crashed down around me, how can I rebuild after deep trauma?","Hey everyone, I am hoping that by coming here I can find some insight into how to pull myself out of this rut I found myself in.  
  
As a back story, I was married, I have three kids, I was the executive director of a non profit in a big city, I had a large social circle, friends and things to do, and I was quite happy and content with my life. I wasn't wealthy, but I was happy and thats all the monetary gain I needed. Fast forward to 5 years ago, my spouse grew bored and started doing some off the wall things like spending days or weeks away from the home with me having to figure out how to work and take care of the kids. Eventually I found out she was dating another man and asked her to work to resolve it with me or leave. She chose to leave.  
  
I held onto the non profit for a year before finally giving it up, but my mental health has been horrid with no little improvement over the last four years. I have been in 5 relationships in that time, all failed and I blame myself. I am not mentally capable of facilitating a romantic relationship in a healthy way, so I realized I need to just step back and work on myself which is why I'm here.  
  
I have a regular job now, I work a 9-5 which is nice because there is structure. I am not longer disciplined enough to run my own schedule. Perhaps there is just no motivation. I have almost no social circle and for some reason blame my looks. I may not be the prettiest man, but people liked me back then   
I don't understand why they'd have a problem with me now. I go to work and struggle to carry a conversation. I often find myself trying to escape the conversation while at the same time craving the interaction. It's weird. I want to have friends, I want to talk to people, but a friend will call and I avoid the call, I don't pick up.   
  
I forced myself to go to karaoke last night at a local bar and invited some of my friends. Every single one declined. So I sat there by myself wondering what was wrong with me.  
  
I don't believe in myself at all and I think that is the core of the issue. I see myself as a failure. I think people are judging my ugly face and don't want to be friends with me. I feel like a loser. I feel completely alone. I don't get out much because I have my three kids (7, 13, and 14 yo) full time. I want to rekindle my friendships with my old friends but I reach out and they don't seem interested or they don't message me back at all. I want to try and make new friends, but the thought of creating something new terrifies me.   
  
I want to return to the social creature I used to be. I want to be able to carry a conversation and build a deep relationship with ANYONE, even just one person, but I can't. I'm crippled by fear. I get up and leave when someone comes into the break room and it's just us two. I live in this nightmare that I Want to be close to someone, but can't.  
  
How do I rebuild confidence? How can I once again believe in myself? Has anyone experienced this, what can I do?  
  
TLDR:  
My life fell apart when my wife left me and my kids four years ago, and my social life and self confidence have been in shambles and I'm trying to rebuild but don't know where to start and am asking for help from this community to help me get back on my feet and be able to at least carry a conversation without feeling like I'm not worth someone else's time.

185,Bullying Trauma,"\*\*Sorry if I didn't made some things clear and if I made grammatical mistakes. English is not my mother tongue\*\*

  
I was bullied from around 2nd or 3rd grade, both physically and mentally, until the end of middle school (8th grade). After finishing middle school, I attended a high school where none of my bullies went.  
In 4th grade, I had heart surgery and was absent from school for nearly 3 months. When I returned, the physical bullying reduced, though it didn't completely stop. However, the mental bullying continued. Instead of being physically beaten with kicks and punches, I occasionally received slaps over the head.  
The primary reason the physical bullying decreased was because people pitied me. I never liked that pity or being looked down upon because of my heart surgery, although I did appreciate the fact that I wasn't physically abused as much anymore.  
At the beginning of high school, I tried to make friends and connections, but the bullying I experienced had left me with severe trauma. Whenever I stepped foot into school, I felt as though I suddenly became autistic. The school environment made me feel scared and anxious, causing me to act extremely weird. I struggled to maintain conversations. Additionally, I should mention that I can't seem to remember most of my childhood, particularly memories involving school. This is a response to the trauma I experienced.  
Due to the fear and anxiety, I often experience stomachaches, which I've discovered is a symptom of anxiety. When I'm at school, I constantly feel the urge to use the bathroom, and as a result, I frequently go. Unfortunately, my classmates, and sometimes even teachers, insult or laugh at me because of this excessive bathroom usage.  
As a coping mechanism, I started to eat less because if I didn't eat, I wouldn't need to use the bathroom as often. I usually only eat when I get home from school.  
Now that I have graduated from 9th grade and it's summer break, during the last 3 months of school, my classmates didn't even acknowledge my existence. This was primarily because I tried to form relationships with them, but I failed miserably. After some time, I stopped attempting to make connections, yet they continued to make fun of me and insult me for about a month before eventually forgetting about me entirely.  
Before my classmates started ignoring me, I was subjected to some bullying by them. One kid even put a knife to my neck in a joking manner, although he didn't intend to harm me. Strangely, I wasn't even affected by it. I thought to myself, ""Cut me, I deserve it."" This is another thing I want to mention: when insulted or made fun of by my current classmates, or even when experiencing extreme fear and anxiety with stomachaches, I think to myself, ""Whatever, I deserve it.""

186,Childhood Head Trauma and Mental Processing.,"When I was three years old I was involved in a terrible car wreak with my mother. She pulled out in front of a large pickup truck and it plowed right into the passengers side door which is where I was located at. My mother told me after she came back to her senses, she noticed that I wasn’t moving, and there was blood running out of my ears. She continued to explain that when paramedics arrived, they had to perform CPR on me. I started breathing again but I was still unconscious. Apparently I was in a coma for a few days and during this time my mother was using tweezers to pull pieces of glass that were buried into my scalp! Anyways I eventually woke up and everyone was back to being happy, everyone except me that is. See the reason why I’m sharing this is because I am not what you would call “the sharpest tool in the shed” I have a mild speech impediment and I’m a super slow learner.  Im physically slow as well, like a slug or some shit. A lot of people think I’m stoned when they first meet me actually lol
Another problem I have is that when people talk to me, their words are like scrambled up?
My mind goes blank a lot to and sometimes it’s just really difficult for me to think clearly.
I finally asked my mom if I suffered any brain damage from the wreck years ago and she said the doctors checked for that and they didn’t see anything wrong?
I got another checkup done when I was like 17 but still didn’t find anything?

All in all I’m just trying to figure out if I’m just a dumbass or if this car wreck caused my brain to be somewhat impaired? I mean I’ve got my high school diploma and associates degree and I’m a federal employee so I can’t be that stupid right? Idk sometimes I do feel like the biggest fucking idiot on the planet. 
I also need to mention that I suffer from anxiety and depression. I know that can affect the way a person thinks. People tell me I’m smart but I just really feel like they’re just being nice and telling me what they think I want to hear!

187,"What constitutes as trauma, and how can I accept it?","I'm making this post cuz my gf was trying to tell me that certain things from my past are indeed trauma, but I am still sceptical. I don't promote toxic masculinity at all but I am still very stuck in the way of thinking of ""If you didn't go to war or have a near death experience that wasn't self inflicted, or have an abusive father, then you don't have trauma""  
  
This came up because my mom caught me with porn (i'm 19). I opened my laptop to show her something and BOOM, incognito tab I forgot to close. Sure, no big deal, happens to everyone. Mom didn't seem too fazed, but she did make the effort to tell me that if she were my gf that she would break up with me. But after apologizing and heading to my room, I started shaking and having a full on panic attack, crying and everything. The same happened to me when I was 12. Just comming into puberty and discovering my sexuality. My parents caught me and I was given hell. They made it a point to make me as ashamed of what I did as possible, degrading me and making it seem like a taboo. And the cherry on top was I was under almost constant surveilance. No more closed doors, constant updates on where I was and a permanent link on all my devices to my parents phones so that they could monitor anything I did. This went on until I was 16. It was those memories that caused me to have my little breakdown, but I still don't see that as trauma. I was just a stupid kid looking at tiddies. How can that be traumatic?  
Another important point to mention are my 2 past suicide attempts. Not much to say there, pretty self explanitory. but now whenever someone mentions that someone self harmed, or commited suicide, suddenly the urge to kill myself comes over me again. But still, I don't see that as trauma. It's all self inflicted, that can't be trauma.  
  
But yet, my gf is trying to tell me that these points mentioned above are infact trauma, but I just can't accept it.  
So I wanted to ask, what IS trauma really? And can stuff like this be trauma?  
I was never really taught how to handle my emotions at all (not even allowed to see a therapist because it makes me look like a problem child). So I thought i'd ask here.

Basically as far as I remember I didn’t have much if any post-trauma effects until I lived with my mum again for a year. It’s been about a year since and I’m trying to recover from the trauma it left on me. However I keep remembering randomly more and more things from my childhood that have been traumatic for me and are affecting me now. I think before I was just thinking that it was due to the trauma of living with her a year ago. However I keep remembering things from my childhood when I used to live with my mum in the past and the things she did and I went through which is somewhat similar to what I went through when I lived with her a year ago. But from what I’ve figured out so far it was definitely much worse than my more recent trauma from her.

192,TW!!! Trauma and Art…,"As a warning, this post contains mentions of grooming, rape and sexual trauma, and suicidal ideation.

If any of what is described above is triggering, I would stop reading now.


I decided to post this here because I feel this post may come across as trauma dumping, and most art subreddits aren’t really specialized in mental health and trauma. But, I would like advice from fellow mentally ill/trauma survivor artists, if that’s okay. I didn’t really know what to tag this so much apologies. If I posted this in the incorrect subreddit, I will delete and post it in the most appropriate sub.

I’ve been an artist for a very long time, but just recently got back into doing art after around a one year hiatus.

I was at my most creative and talented when I was in-and-out of the mental hospital, and being actively groomed and sexually abused. I was producing multiple drawings left and right. After I got put on antipsychotics and raped, my inspiration started dying. I was producing less and less.

 Give or take about a year now, I’m in the adult world, been processing the trauma I’ve endured, working a lot, dissociating for long periods of time, falling into delusion, going through the mental health system again, and just generally in survival mode trying to scrape by. I haven’t done art in a while and now I’m trying to get back into it.

I love the idea of being an artist again, but feel pressured to produce the same quality of art I did a year ago (because I am basically programmed to set unrealistic expectations for myself at this point) and sometimes accidentally associate producing art with the trauma I’ve endured. I also am having major blocks and am finding it hard to produce anything.

Any advice of any sort is welcomed. I’m sure I’m not alone in this and would find any advice regarding these struggles helpful.

I am an mental health tech, and my job is to basically be a glorified babysitter for special needs kids. I'm good at my job, but something last night makes me start shaking when I think about it. 

One of my clients scares me. I don't know her exact problem, but her father told me that her mother had done dope and drank alcohol when she was pregnant with her. 

This girl was throwing a tantrum after we left a pet store. She insisted that she held cats (which we couldn't because covid.) First she whined, then she cried, then she snapped. I had to call her mother, and we stayed on the phone with her to get her to leave the pet store, literally one step at a time. 

When we got to the car, she began *screaming* at the top of her lungs that she wanted my tablet to play games on. I wouldn't let her, because she already threatened to break it. This lasted for twenty minutes. I drove with her, another client, and my shadower(new hire in training), to the highway. The girl suddenly stopped screaming, unbuckled herself, and got up next to me while I was driving 70mph. She leaned against me, and told me that I was ugly, had no friends, deserved to die, and would kill me if I let her. She began reaching for the wheel all slowly and dramatically like she was going to yank it into the oncoming traffic from my left side. The shadower yanked her back, but she kept lunging for the wheel, trying to make us crash into the other cars. I eventually pulled over on the side of the highway and called her mom. The girl then opened the car door and tried to run out into the field, saying that she was going to get us in trouble for losing her. We dragged her back into the car, and put on the child lock. She didn't like that, and tried to fight us once we got settled again. When her mom finally came, she started acting all nice, denying everything that happened. She took the child home, and we took the other client home.

I forgive this girl, because she has a mental illness and couldn't control herself. Yet, I can't stop shaking, and I couldn't sleep that night because I kept dreaming about deadly car crashes. Car crashes are one of my biggest fears, I cant help but feel terrified when I even think about getting in one. I get genuinely scared when I picture her in my mind, and deep down I want her dead. 

I will have to see her again, only time I will be prepared. How do I get over this fear that causes me to black out, start trembling, and cant form words correctly?

I'm finding myself being able to look back a bit more objectively and now I'm wondering ...was I in a trauma bond?? I'm curious what people think...

Beginning of our relationship she was very heavy with the affection and tbf we were both quick with the ""I love you""s and we were very physical and typical honeymoon stage...then slowly and surely she started to be more and more mean and quite distant. Little snappy comments that would range from belittling my opinion on something to full blown 'having a go at me' in public. I would constantly feel like I was walking on Egg Shells never knowing how she'd react to anything I'd say or do. However these occurrences were often followed by her being physically affectionate towards me...very much 'her doing stuff for me'. I'd find myself staying for the occasional good stuff and 'living with' the way she treated me until she eventually ended it herself after what ended up being a 2 year relationship.

What do people think?? I've only read a bit on trauma bonds but now I can take a step back it sounds a bit similar??

200,My childhood trauma and my questions on the effects of it.,"I hate to admit it, but I’m a victim of childhood trauma; that being emotional abuse, neglect, and physical abuse. It was only roughly four years ago where I started accepting that the things I had been through were wrong and by normalising it for so long, all the emotions and feelings of loneliness have caught up to me. 

I’ve never told anyone the ins and outs of my life and I deeply think it’s because I developed so many survival traits from my traumatic childhood, resulting in me being incredibly independent and embarrassed to ask for help or have others feel pity for me.. but now, being eighteen and realising how poor my mental health is from it, I have so many questions and things I want to say since I’ve bottled it up for so long.

First, I’m an immigrant in the UK. Was not born here, my sister wasn’t born here, and neither were my parents. I moved when I was 3. This might seem random, but I strongly think it plays a large role in my trauma since it means I grew up with parents who were socialised in different ways. They’re Eastern European. I hate myself for having a feeling of understanding as to why they are the way they are, but then I remind myself that just because some things may be normalised in their countries, it does not mean it is right. We lived in a one bedroom flat for ten years, me and my sister sharing a room, and in those ten years, that house became haunted with memories that I wish I could erase. My whole family was abusive to one another. My dad abused my mum, my mum abused my dad, my mum abused me and my sister, and my dad rarely, only once, abused me and my sister. I have horrible flashbacks of the abuse I witnessed. My mum choking my sister on Christmas Day, my dad punching my mum leaving her with a busted lip, my dad punching my sister and giving her a nosebleed, running away into the bathroom and locking myself in there whilst my mum chased me with a belt and threatened me, protecting myself with duvet covers so the belt wouldn’t hurt me as much, my mum pulling me and my sister by the ears and hair, my mum hitting my dad with rolling pins and hangers, my mum breaking hangers from how hard she hit us all, my dad pushing my mum up against the wall with his fist up to her face, my mum throwing everything off the shelves in mine and my sisters room and chucking our clothes out the draw whilst she stood there with a belt and forced us to clean it all up. There’s so much more but the list is long enough already. Unfortunately, by being emotionally abused aswell and belittled by being told no one will believe me and no one will ever love me, I underestimate how severe the things I’ve been through are and always wonder if they really are that bad or if it is normal. 

Now that there is a small understanding of the physical abuse. We can move on to the part where my mum reported my dad to the police for domestic abuse and I wasn’t able to see him for several months. I remember the hurt I felt seeing my dad being put in handcuffs. Although my dad wasn’t the best person, I strongly believe my mum was worse. I felt bad for my mum, don’t get me wrong, but I developed an even stronger anger towards her when she reported because she did that to protect herself, but it was fine for her abuse towards us all? I was 11 when this happened and this was the first time I self harmed and started writing long paragraphs about my wish to die. Eleven. I remember my mum always crying to me about my dad and the abuse he inflicted, and, by being so young and being an empath, I always stood by her side even through the hurt and pain and bruises I had on my body from her. She never understood. I KNOW my mum has mental health issues, I’m leaning towards BPD, anger issues and probably others, but she doesn’t believe in mental health. Same with my dad.

For others who have suffered similarly, I have several questions as I’m trying to understand myself more and understand how my trauma has effected me since I’ve never spoken to anyone about this stuff and at this extent.

1. Is it normal to still feel sorry for your parents and the stuff they’ve been through?
If it was just me and my sister who were abused, I definitely would not be thinking this, but considering everyone in my household are victims, I feel sorry for us all. My sister doesn’t. My sister is a bigger person than me (emotionally) and is very aware of the rights and wrongs. This makes me feel scared of myself and the person I am. Should I be feeling guilty for my parents? I’m worried that, as I do, it will mean I am going to grow up and be like them.. my biggest fear.

2. Can I form a relationship without telling my partner about my trauma?
I’m so inflicted on whether my future relationships will work out if I don’t tell them, or if I can go without it. I already really struggle with relationships since I can’t form emotional connections and am very insecure and as my mum used to tell me no one will ever love me, it has caught up to me in my teenage years and I shut down and feel very insecure and truly believe the person I am seeing does not actually like me.

3. Is the only way I can heal by cutting my whole family out my life?
I want to heal. It’s my biggest wish. I’m so unwell mentally and I feel like I have a hurricane in my brain every day. But I’m still in contact with my family which links back to my empathy and feeling guilt for them. I doubt they wished of a life like this just as much as I never wished for this life and, if anything, would rather stop living than constantly have memories of my life. When I’m angry at my parents, I bring up what they have done to me and my sister, but they always always always deny it and say it never happened, making me feel insane but, since me and my sister have grown up, we have briefly spoken about it and have comforted eachother with not feeling insane and that what happened, happened. So. Do I cut them out and start a new life and heal but forever hold a sense of guilt, or do I live with the memories, suffer, yet brighten my parents lives with the idea that at least their children didn’t leave them. I just feel so guilty because they left their countries to try give us a better life.

I have so many more questions and rants about my life, but I’m aware this is already severely long. I haven’t written this to gain sympathy, it’s more so a rant since I’m anonymous on here, and also a hope that someone will reply and help me with my questions.

201,Struggling with the purpose of suffering and trauma,"I am a child abuse survivor. 

It's been more than 13 years since I escaped my home and I am 30 this year.

I have mostly moved on. I have built a fairly good life: decent income, an excellent partner, roof above my head...

But obviously the some effects of my abuse still linger. I mean I guess it is unrealistic to expect two decades of abuse to not leave a lasting mark. 

Given all this, I am constantly dissatisfied with life's lack of meaning specifically in the context of abuse and trauma. I guess I have made peace with the fact that my father will not face any kind of retribution, divine or legal, for all that he did to me and my sister. He is still out there acting as though we abandoned him as he got older. And the Indian society really laps up the narrative of the west-influenced children abandoning their parents instead of caring for them. And I guess my father conveniently ""missed out"" parts of the story like when he inflict huge burn wounds on my mother's hands with an ironbox or the part where he made her lick her curry off the toilet floor because it was ""too salty"". 

But whenever my father's mistakes come back to haunt my life, I am constantly wondering what it all meant or atleast what it all was for. I am unable to accept that something so cruel and something so devastating could happen to me and it could affect my life so much and yet it would be so utterly pointless.

I mean what can I really do now. I can't change the past and I can't just forget it as it still impacts me to this day. 

So what is the point of it all? To make me stronger? No, I don't want to believe that this should happen to anyone for any purpose including making them strong. To maybe ensure that I break the cycle with my kids? I don't want to traumatise my kid with that kind of overbearing purpose. Let them be what they want to be instead of being the purpose of my pain.

Trust me, most stories we are told about pain and suffering is just BS to help others to cope with the fact that life can be undeservely cruel. Not for the victim, but for society. ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger"". BS, you were already strong. ""No pain, no gain"" Again BS, there is no gain from pain. Just trauma. ""Pour your suffering into your art"". And learn that no one gives a shit. No one wants to heard about your sadness because they are dealing with their own sadness. And most absurd one: ""God gives the toughest battles to his strongest soldiers"". Lol, why? 

I am struggling with the senselessness of it all. 

Someone recently suggested forgiving my father. It enraged me. My anger and my hate towards him is the only punishment I can deal him. I don't want to free him of that. Not that he himself feels burdened by that at all, lol. 

So what's the point? Is life so cruel that it can throw abuse on to a child as a joke? I guess I know the answer is yes, but I am struggling to accept it.",1706471021.0,False,1,0,liberaltilltheend,None,1adb539,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1adb539/struggling_with_the_purpose_of_suffering_and/
202,How do I heal from lifelong trauma?,"I guess I should explain a bit more off the title-

It’s been about three months since I got out of my last relationship, and it was a good one, my longest (3 years). The signs were apparent when things ended but I didn’t want to believe them, I never do. When things finally ended she kept telling me she wanted to be friends but I warned her that wasn’t going to work no matter how badly either of us wanted that because of how I eventually act out. And I did, as expected-

It started with trying to win her back, then I started coming up with excuses to see her, then eventually she got sick of it and we had to block each other. I wasn’t surprised because this happens every relationship and I have 0 control over the flood of emotions.

Now this leads here. Since then, I’ve been consistently searching for someone new. Meeting people in classes, tinder, parties, the works, but I get so attached so easily it scares them all off. And my friends and family keep telling me to work on myself and learn to love myself. There lies the problem.

The problem is I DO love myself. I’m literally my favorite person. I think I have a great life, I have great opportunities and I wouldn’t change a thing. So it annoys me when someone says I don’t. My issues stems from the fact that ever since I was a toddler (I’m not exaggerating, though I don’t feel comfortable sharing why that is) I’ve always felt alone and relationships are the only outlet from the depression. How am I supposed to heal from something I’ve had for my entire life?

204,"Reliving my Childhood trauma, advice wanted","TL:DR; If you don't want to read the entire post, skip to ""The symptoms:"" which are at the bottom of this post. That is there part where i descibe what i seek advice on.  
I'm also not a native English speaker which is why i have a somewhat difficult time explaining some things in my post.  


Hi r/mentalhealth i'm writing here since I don't know where to turn with this topic. If this is not fitting to be posted here and there is a better place to post it, please post a link to the subreddit.

The advice i'm looking for is how to describe and potentially identify the symptoms i recently experienced in relation to reliving my childhood trauma as i'm currently going to a therapist and trauma from my past is what we are going to focus on in my next appointment.

The Trauma:  
This all took place back in the early days of the internet, circa 2003-2005. By that time i think i was 9 or 10 years old.   
back then I used to frequent a Swedish site called [Hamsterpaj.net](https://Hamsterpaj.net) which used to host a lot of flash games and flash videos. On this day I had found a new game in where you guide your mouse through a maze that gets gradually more difficult the further into the game you go.  
By now i think Anyone who frequented the internet back in mid to late 2000s know exactly what im talking about.  
I got to level 2 and failed a couple of times at the start, but once i manage to get a good portion in on the level the maze would be much narrower and harder to navigate. Once i got this far i leaned very close to the screen and tried my best to beat the level. But ofc i failed as the game was designed for this purpose.  
A goulish black and white baby face popps up on my screen and a scream blasting at full volume echoes out the speakers.  
I remember Pinching my eyes shut and covering my ears as hard as i could while this scream kept blasting through my speakers.  
I do not turn of the game or turn of the speakers on parents pc. I remember walking out of the room still having my ears tightly covered. In the room next to the pc was my mother and brother who both could hear the PC loud and clearly. And i swear, had you been outside of our house you would still have heard the scream from the game, although very feintly.  
I vividly remember my mother having to go in to the PC room and turn this game of, after which she comforts me while i sit on our TV Sofa and crying.

As surprising as this might sound, this was not the infamous maze mouse game with the exorcist at the end. Although i would stumble upon that and the ""car"" commercial jump scare sometime later in my childhood. For anyone curious, the game on hamsterpaj was not named anything like ""scary mouse game"" as that would have been to obvious. whatever its name was I don't remember.

Present day:  
Its been about 20 years since the incident with the mouse game and i had forgotten about it. But in a mere coincidence i had started looking into old flash websites on the way back machine when i remembered hamsterpaj and all the fun games and flashes i had seen on there as a kid. Flashes such as xiao xiao was on there, though called ""Fight 2"" for some reason.  
But given it was a very specific site that only Swedish people visited back in the day, i did not have high hopes of it actually being archived. But oh man was i wrong.  
From what i found on the way back machine, A LOT of hamsterpajs olden days, for some reason, had been archived. And going through the flash animations on there, which to my surprise, almost everyone of them still works. I find a name under the category of games called ""Kluriga spel"". The games name in question was ""Invisibility"".  
That name in this category made my stomach sink. The memory of the trauma i experience all those years ago popped back into my memory.  
This game however was not the one i stumbled upon as a kid. It was a mouse game, a difficult one at that, but no jumpscare was in it. I was so sure that this had to be the one that i downloaded the flash and decompiled it in search of this one image. But it was not there. I was somewhat relived that this was not the game that traumatized me. But at the same time, now i had to find the actual game.  
You see, my thought was that by seeing this image again or even the game again as a adult and approach it with caution. Maybe i could get some realazation or overcome this trauma by seeing it in controlled enviorment?  
In the past i have actually had this approach before. But everytime i tried to look for this game, all i could find was the exorcist one, which had been much more infamous.   
But on this day, in less then 1 hour after seeing the title ""Invisibility"", i found the game that traumatized me as a kid. I did not even have to start the game or look at the title of. Because on  the site that i found the game   
([http://www.jumpscaregames.com/play/scary-pop-up/japanese-scary-maze.html](http://www.jumpscaregames.com/play/scary-pop-up/japanese-scary-maze.html))  
They have the jumpscare image right bellow the actual game. When I saw this image I instantly knew that i had found what i was looking for.  


Reliving the trauma:  
First things first. I knew that if i would try and approach this in a controlled manor i would have to do the following:  
\*Completely mute my sound. Speakers disconnected and headphones turned of.  
\*""Play"" the game by seeing as little as possible of the jump scare.  
With sound muted and the game taking up maybe an inch of my screen in diameter i started to play it.  
And just as i remember. Loosing at the start of level 2 will not trigger the jump scare. But once i got to the end of the level i looked away and lost on purpose.  
And there it was. Looking back on my screen, the face that traumatized me as a kid was pullsating. I even remeber in vivid detail that choppy animation of the face growing and shrinking.  
I turned of the game almost imidiatly after seeing this again.  


The symptoms:  
This is what i'm seeking advice on.  
For an hour or so after ""emulating"" the trauma by seeing just the animation of and the actual jumpscare, my stomach was physically hurting. I don't know to exactly describe the feeling but il try my best.  
The pain was sitting in the middle to lower part of my stomach. It was not a sharp sensation like when you get a cramp after running for to long. It felt more like something was just sitting there taking up space as it hurt. Maybe a dull sensation? I did not feel bloated so it was not that.  
My throat started hurting as well. the pain was seated around and bellow my adams apple i belive. This pain i could only feel however when i was breathing in. This pain was dull as well but it kind of resemble that feeling you get in your throat when you are out of breath from exercise and can taste blood in your mouth even though no blood is there.  
My eyes where lightly burning aswell and i wiped away some tears, but this sensation went away much faster then the others.  
These 2 pains would keep going until I feel asleep a bit later in the night, so it was not a full day ordeal, more so maybe 1-2 hours.  


So given my desciption of the symptoms, is there anything that instantly comes to mind? Or a better way of describing what i felt like a category. Like if i told someone i felt panic or anxiety, something that could convey what i felt explained a bit more straight forward.  


Lastly i want to tell you all that this is infact a throw away account. The reason for this is that now one has taken me seriously when i tell them about my trauma, even when i was a kid. I have however been picked on for telling this and been called a pussy for the way i reacted, hence i don't want to this to be associated with me.",1700056194.0,False,1,0,MobileMasterpiece797,None,17vu181,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/17vu181/reliving_my_childhood_trauma_advice_wanted/
205,Why your trauma is a blessing in disguise,"I had a pretty shit early life. Severe trauma from as early as 8-9 years old which destroyed all confidence. Imagine the damage being addicted to p*rnography causes before you've even hit puberty.

One thing you learn quickly: if you don't carry yourself with respect, you're going to be trampled over like a doormat - or in my case, used as a punch bag. 

While that all ended after high school, the damage remained. I won't go into too much detail but I have made a post in the past about the hell this created for me later in life. 

Without exaggeration, most people would have taken their own lives given what I had gone through, and the only reason I'm still here is because every attempt made seemed to fail. 

**Yet...**

Every second I suffered - heartbreaks, open body surgery, severe depression & anxiety, beatings... the whole lot

**I would not change for the world.**


When you clear out all the emotions that built up over the years and remained trapped within your system... while building yourself through trials, continually conquer and improve the areas in which you are weak...

**You start becoming that person you thought wasn't even possible.**


This archetype is the homeless man who became a millionaire. The heroin addict who conquered his demons and helped others heal. The refugee who started from nothing and become one of the greatest fighters alive. 



**When you begin reverse engineering the thoughts and feelings you were made to believe about yourself, you discover who you truly are.**

By no means is it going to be easy. It will require a lot of crying, writing, and doing things that right now, you may not even know are possible to heal from. It will take courage.

But it will also be the **greatest journey you ever embark upon** that doesn't end until your very last breath. 


**My testimony is this:**

Trauma is the most painful yet greatest teacher you could possibly experience, but **until you unlock and let go of the feelings that are trapped within, they will continue to destroy your life** as you waste your days chasing hits of dopamine to mask the pain. 

If you're willing to pursue externalising the trauma and integrating your shadow as the compass that guides your life, you may just find precisely all the answers you are looking for.

206,How Do You Not Let Past Trauma Affect Your Life?,"Hi! A little backstory, when I was in college I experienced a traumatic event which resulted me cutting ties with a huge group of friends and dropping out of college. I’ve been in therapy ever since then (~6ish years) working on everything thing else but the trauma I’ve felt. Despite the progress I’ve made, I still feel like whenever I go into my sessions I always stray away from the topic. I’ve tried before with a previous therapist but I don’t think we worked well with each other. Overall I’ve came to terms that as a result of the trauma, it’s been extremely difficult for me to make friends and trust people. 

I thought I was “protecting my peace” for the longest time but now that I’m looking at my life from a different angle I’m starting to think I just got accustomed to isolating myself. Currently I’m with an amazing partner who has a huge friend group and every time I’m around them I feel.. weird? I’m not sure if it’s me being triggered but I literally feel like I shut down and feel super anxious and like I wanna run away. It’s super important to my partner that I go to hangouts and make an effort to talk to his friends but I feel like every time I try I just remember all the pain I felt from my ex friends.

Does anyone have any advice or tips on how to manage this feeling I get? Even knowing that there’s someone who understand how I’m feeling would be helpful. I feel so devestated and angry with myself that even after so much time I still feel like this. I’m worried it’ll mess up not only the relationship with my partner but the few friends I have as well.",1708716608.0,False,4,1,Spicylemon_,None,1ay9d20,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ay9d20/how_do_you_not_let_past_trauma_affect_your_life/
207,Having trouble connecting with reality from trauma. need help,"Okay. So be prepared for a paragraph or so of my summed up life. WORTH THE READ
When I was a small child my dad was a hard worker and I had a good mother. At this time you don't realize that things are traumatizing. I did get whipped but not beat. It was more of emotional trauma. We were church goers and I was constantly in fear of going to hell for small white lies and I thought God was always watching me. (Now I am upset to say but I don't know what to believe because honestly I think we just die.)

I was a little chunky as a child and I would get questioned by my mother about how much I was eating at my mamaws... constantly... and when I would attend bday parties with my friends my parents would tell their parents not to give me more than one piece of pizza or one hot dog ect.... I grew a insecure ego and by the time I was in middle school I hated myself and was scared to talk to anyone because I didn't know what they would think, I was barely eating and developed eating disorder by the time highschool came.I would take laxatives and eat a small thing to poop out after wards. I also developed anxiety bad, I would hide in the bathroom at lunch if my friend wasn't there and I barely talked to anyone.

Around the age of highschool my mother and father were having problems my mom had became addicted to pain killers and my parents separated. I can remember to this day my dad saying he didn't want us and she could keep us. (My sisters and I)
I was 15. 
Shortly after I met a guy that was 16 he was also really shy. We became a relationship I switched schools, was more out there and was on the track team and well I got pregnant he became abusive (physically) the mental started before hand. With this one I did take up for myself a few times.
This was a big deal in court with my parents and I got blamed for ruining everything and my dad said he didn't want anything to do with the baby. He later apologized.
Right before my daughter was born I was tricked my my childs father's mother into signing 50/50 papers and we've dealt with him to this day it's been 9yrs 
He has been physically abusive with my daughter ive filed several dvps nothing gets done.
I know my story is every where and I'm sorry I am in a rush but, back to when I had my duagher at 16-
My childs father cheated on me that night and we separated for good because I just didn't want her around anything like that.
 Fast frw to age 17.. I am living with my grandmother at this point because my mom is on drugs, my dad hates me and my childs father is a problem.
My ""cousin"" invites me to drink one night with his friends and they leave I get raped.
Go to the hospital do swabs and kits.
Move from there into a place with one of my gay friends because my ""cousin"" refused to and nothing gets done.
I get a job at the hospital after I move in with my friend everything going decent for me and my child.
One day we see a boy that one of my cousins knew that was bisexual and we hook him and my friend up. My friend wasn't that interested in him. So this guy ends up befriending me since my friend and him didn't work out. 
My mental health is taking a toll at this time and I lose my job because I wasn't showing up to work. 
I start hanging out with the guy my friend initially hooked up with. 
A yr later this guy tells me he's in love with me and I thought that he was just gay. 
Well we get together because honestly I wanted someone I could trust,I thought who more than my bff.
Well, we are together for about a yr and he's really jealous over me and protective. He doesn't want me speaking to any guy I'm like okay well he loves me, blah blah you think I'd know by now.
Anyways he cheats on me with his ex and I find out I'm pregnant shortly later. We continue the relationship while I try to void that but he starts hitting me and chasing me and just being abusive and my daughter had came down stairs and told her dad. Her dad ""being no better"" went and filed something on me and yet they took that into consideration and I had to go through this fake happy relationship forever. By this time my 2nd was born and we have moved to a different home. I get cheated on 7 times by my ""bff"" hit on and just absolutely disrespected. And all of this is a dark secret because can't let system know whats going on with me. I am currently trying to leave and get my things together but it's scary.

210,Are intrusive/unwanted/trauma thoughts a symptom mental health disorder?,"Quite often I cannot fall asleep because my mind is racing with memories of traumatizing events and lead to very bad, I would even say dangerous, intrusive thoughts. It’s so bad that I cannot fall asleep on a regular basis. I basically HAVE TO go 36-48 hours with zero sleep before I’m tired enough to crash without bad thoughts. And the lack of sleep causes severe mood swings. When I am fully rested, I’m a very happy person, until I lay down to sleep. Then all the sudden memories of bad things that have happened play back in my mind and I get really angry or depressed and restless and have to watch a movie or scroll TikTok or something to get the thoughts out of my head. Sometimes the lack of sleep combined with the memories can lead to severe fight or flight panic attacks. 

Is this PTSD, or like bi polar or something? I’m not sure how to deal with it and the lack of sleep just destroys my quality of life. I used to smoke weed for this but cannot control how much I’m smoking and I end up stoned from the second I wake to the second I pass out, and it doesn’t fully help the intrusive thoughts or memories, and it makes me lazy and paranoid and unmotivated and gain weight, so I quit smoking entirely about two months ago. 

What do I do? Like I said, if I could just go to sleep these things are manageable in my daily life. But the lack of sleep is starting to really get to me at this point. Do I need medication or a sleep aid? ",1708808302.0,False,1,1,OlManJenkins_93,None,1az56mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1az56mf/are_intrusiveunwantedtrauma_thoughts_a_symptom/
211,Living with unresolved childhood trauma gives you super powers (SuperTrauma),"Since this is being hard to start lets just start with my childhood.

I was a mistake. Always wear protection or you will get a fucker like me.  To cut it short my mother and father were fwb and they made me (hi hi sex). My dad had also a rough childhood and has bad traumas from it so he has a god complex now even thought his feet smell like shit. When my mom said she does not want to marry him(likes not smelly feet) he went boom and wanted revenge. He saw revenge in me and there everything starts. My physical needs were barely meet since i was just a tool and other stuff like emotional neglect and what not bla bla just to make my mother fell the worst way possible without a care in the world about me. With my mother it was parenthesization . She was venting to me how hard it was on her what my father was doing. Basically i was the parent. There was no redemption arc(except when he picked me up on his shoulders so my mom would be jealous and i intentionally shit myself hi hi) so because of all that i dont recognize my emotions, trust issues, lie, manipulate, have troubles with relationships, cant form romantic relationships at all, anger issues etc.

Cons of being raised this way:

not important/not interesting

Pros:

Spider sense. Yes i have ebay spider sense. Being manipulate all the time since being born makes you not trust anybody ad to that being scared of everything that can maybe hurt you emotionally. i can sense lies or danger from miles away

Rage buff. This is one of defense mode quirks. Plus 10 pain tolerance Plus 8 body strength Plus 15 voice strength Plus 5 looking scary 

Sociopath buff. Again defense mode quirks. Plus 20 manipulation Plus 0 empathy Plus 0 emotion

Superman resistance kind of. Not physical but mental. Never fell gross. I can tell you my mom is a hoe go sell my body eat dog shit of the floor and then go home to kiss my mom on the cheek. 

Emotional neglect power. Now this is op. Nobody can hurt your feelings since you never show them and even if you want to show them remember you cant recognize them.

Girlfriend bonds. How can a girl cheat on you if you cant even get into a relationship even if you want.

And the best one yet The Alcohol Expert or TAE. Since you num your pain in cigarettes, alcohol etc. You are an expert even at age of 16

213,[Moderator Approved] [REPOST] Research investigating childhood trauma and self-concept clarity,"\*\*UPDATE  
This a repost from around 5 weeks ago. I'm reposting to let you know the study will be closing end of the day on Monday 1st April, so if you want to have your experience captured in the findings, please take part while you still have time.

We have reached the minimum number of participants needed for data analysis, which is incredible! I am so grateful to all those who have given up their time to complete this study! The more datasets we have, the more reliable the findings will be, the more representative the data will be of the UK wide population, and the more confident we can be in the conclusions drawn. Please see all the information below. Huge thank you to all of you!  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


Hi everyone,

  
My name is Melanie Taylor and I'm a trainee clinical psychologist at Lancaster University in the UK.  
I'm doing a research project for my doctorate thesis investigating the relationship between childhood trauma and self-concept clarity (that is, having a clear sense of who you are as a person). I'm also looking to see how self-defining memories play a role.

  
**Who can take part?**

Participants must be:

* UK residents
* Fluent in English
* At least 21 years old  


AND identify as having experienced at least one traumatic event before 18 years of age.  
An event which is traumatic includes any experience which you found very stressful, frightening or distressing.  
This may have involved:

* Experiencing or witnessing aggression, violence, emotional or sexual abuse
* Experiencing or witnessing accident or injury
* Experiencing illness or someone close to you experiencing illness
* Loss or bereavement
* Parental separation
* Experiencing bullying
* Natural disaster
* Living through and/or escaping conflict

This list is not full - you may have experienced something else which you found traumatic.  


**What does the study involve?**  
The study is entirely online and takes about 10-15 mins to complete. If you decide to take part, you will be asked to type out a childhood memory in a paragraph, and complete three questionnaires. Please type the memory out in the text box if you are able to.  
You are free to withdraw at any time without penalty or having to give a reason.

# [Click here to go to the study.](https://bit.ly/48eE9vJ)

  
Please make sure you read all the information and instructions fully and carefully before taking part.  
I will end recruitment in April 2024. Once it is ready, I will share a summary of the findings on this post, and also on my X and instagram research pages u/Melanie_ClinPsy.

  
I'm also hoping to publish the findings in an academic peer reviewed journal, and that it will help influence further research into understanding the psychological impact of experiencing childhood trauma.

  
Thank you so much to everyone for your support, I'm incredibly grateful for your time!

214,Advice for upcoming class and workplace trauma PTSD,"Hi!

I am extremely excited to be attending a training course soon that I've been wanting to take for 5 years.

I just got admitted and someone from my previous team is in the class.  Its a small class of less than 50 students and will involve lots of small group work. 

This person is unfortunately both the direct and indirect source of an enormous amount of workplace trauma and PTSD from my previous job.  So much so that I had a visceral reaction to seeing their name on the roster.  I've spent a lot of time since leaving that position getting to a better place, learning where triggers were, and working through trauma.  I've known for a few weeks now about their presence in the class and all I feel is sick and dread.  One of my friends is even in the class, and this is all I can think about.

This person is a major reason why I left - and I'd been in my role a long time.

I'm worried this is going to continue to override my ability to focus on anything else.  Also I'm worried I won't feel comfortable sharing anything in the class in their presence, and that I will find many things they share to be triggering.

Summary: My girl suffered some pretty serious Trauma when she was young. Family experienced sexual abuse and violence etc. 

She gets triggered often because she has a reaction to a loud noise or just overall gets angry (in traffic or whatever). I try to talk to her, talk her out of the funk she often gets in, but she just wants to be alone, sometimes 1-2 days at a time. I have a habit of engaging her and trying to walk her through it and help her understand that  everything is ok, with no success. When she is in a funk it goes with her everywhere. She can’t talk to someone without it being obvious she’s having an issue with something. It can be quite embarrassing at times. 

I need some help/advice on how to cope with my partners mental illness. We have been to a physician and her treatment is 4K plus. 

Myself, I think it’s super annoying. I want to help but she wants no help, but if I leave her alone it almost justifies it for her, when most of it isn’t accurate and becomes overblown.

220,I don't know what's happening? Do I have trauma?,"Okay, I've been to a psychiatric hospital 4 times, and now it's really getting to me for some reason. 

One second I'm fine, then I randomly get these images in my head of what everything looked like, specifically in the one I went to three out of the four times.

Nothing really bad even happened there, I went voluntarily because I felt unsafe, I never experienced anything too bad while I was there, but I just can't get it all out of my head.

I wish I knew what was going on. It's affected me a little before, but right now it's basically burned into my subconscious. I just don't want to think about it, but I can't stop thinking about it.

It wasn't that bad, I was mostly just there, and then I got out. End of story.

It could be because I'm approaching the one year anniversary of my second stay. Back in October it was the one year anniversary of my first stay, and I ended up going back. Maybe my brain just associates this time of year as ""feel shitty"" time.

It's not even specific memories, I just randomly get images in my head of what it looked like. Like the group room, or the common area, or the bedrooms.

I hate this, I had a panic attack 10 minutes before an audition because of it. That really messed up my performance. It went sort of okay anyways, but I can't let this keep happening.

221,"coping with anxiety and trauma, I think I'm becoming an alcoholic.","Hi, I'm 21 in my last year of college (studying CS), I have a very rough childhood, abusive father both physically and emotionally, and an even worse time in my teenage years, it was terrible, something terrible happened to me and my family in 2018-2020 that was traumatic and I don't think I ever recovered from it, I never had a normal social life since I was a kid, school was hell, it was basically trying to survive school then coming back home and trying to survive my dad, interacting with him is like walking in a mine field, you can't expect what will set him off, its literally the dumbest things ever, just being a kid angered him, everything I did as a kid made him so angry that basically my existence was so aggravating to him and I didn't do anything wrong, I just stopped talking as a result, I was getting good grades but I was bullied harshly which angered him even more because he saw me as a ""weak nerd"" so he would beat me up so I can ""man up"", school was bad too, my grades suffered over the years I had issues with teachers and I had issues with every student they would gang up and bully me because I was extremely quiet again as a result to getting the shit beat out of me every time I talked since the age of 6 I think.



as a result now at 21 I'm always on edge, panicking, paranoid, always on the lookout for something, its like I'm chronically on fight or flight mode, always stressed and nervous, unable to socialize due to the fear of rejection, I only went on one date and got ghosted, that's the only experience with women I ever had, and I don't think I will have better experiences in the near future.



I have the social skills of a potato, I'm very self aware and very self conscious, I can't and I don't leave my room 90% of the time, I can't go to the gym unless its almost empty, I'm unable to make relationships, I wasted my college years in mentally ill struggling to do anything and now I have a 2.5 GPA, I can pump it up to 3.2 I think, only if I get straight As every single semester, I have 3 left, I have failed.



I do freelance web development now which pays me well, much more than the average college student but still, overall I'm a failure, and I can't cope with the feelings of be being like this, I can't cope with the shit memories, I can't cope with anything, I'm extremely sensitive I hyper fixate on small social interactions and label them as negative, I isolate myself as a result, I'm feeling like my chest is being crushed and I want to genuinely die or get so rich that I'm able to live alone without going out, I recently started drinking, previously I couldn't because of my parents (no privacy whatsoever they used to spy on me while showering to make sure I wasn't masturbating or smoking, they used to search my devices, my room, and spy on me on the phone) and when I got to college I tried it once and stopped out of fear because I started liking alcohol a little too much.



it got to the point where thinking about drinking alcohol was gave me the same feeling of liking someone or having a crush on someone, and as a result I stopped drinking, but recently it became apparent to me that I can't function without something that suppresses the horrible feelings that I'm encountering, its either Xanax or alcohol because I can't function in this state, I can't study, I can't work, I can't leave my room, I can't do anything.",1710882382.0,False,0,0,_extremely_smart_,None,1bivbrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1bivbrl/coping_with_anxiety_and_trauma_i_think_im/
222,why do I have relatively trauma-based mental illnesses if I had a really privileged childhood?,"Other than being a child of immigrants, with only my parents w me (which I speculate may have impacted my socialization as a child), I literally have no reason to have an eating disorder or be bipolar etc. My parents were always wonderful role models, and while I didn’t ever really have close friends, no one bullied me traumatically. And ive been so privileged to not experience anything traumatic  in my childhood before my MI developed so I’m just like ???

It’s so stupid honestly. Like I really want to switch my brain off bc there’s no reason I should be this screwed up with absolutely no reason.

223,Dealing with Previous Workplace Trauma,"I've been through and am still going through a lot in my life overall. I have several medical issues including Multiple Sclerosis. The biggest issue I'm dealing with is handling all the trauma I've gotten from my last job. It's very lengthly, but I'll do my best to summarize, but it's still long. 

I also want to note I've attempted with getting talk therapy in the past and had a really bad experience. I was juggled between 3-4 different people as they continuously called in sick, quit, or forgot they had an appointment. This was over a different issue as well.

I have worked two different positions in two hospitals owned by the same company. The first was admissions and they overwhelmed me and had me doing several different positions even when the entire department knew of my medical issues. I was constantly stressed and my 2nd boss (first one quit not too long after hiring me) was extremely rude and unprofessional. I was in a union and they stood up for me several times. She even made a fake paper for me to sign saying I was refusing to work overtime. She eventually found something to get me wrote up for with HR after I had expressed numerous times I was being pulled in too many directions to focusing on what I needed to do. She would also publicly humiliate me. This was constant. I would hide in the bathroom the farthest away on my break to calm down every day every break. This went on for a year.

I switched to the next position after my boss had held me the longest she could. Everything seem to be better until after 6 months. I did my best to get along with everyone but the main group I was in was terrible. Constantly and I mean constantly talking about people. It was so bad all I knew was to do was to be silent because I didn't want to be alone or not helped when I came across a work issue. It kept escalating until they were severely bullying a coworker (who is just the definition of kindness). HR was notified numerous times by numerous people and nothing ever happened. Then that coworker went on medical leave. Out of respect for my friend I won't go into what happened. Just know it was heartbreaking. 

Then the bullying started to spread to a new department my boss took over. Fighting constantly. All the time. You couldn't focus it was so bad. Understaffing as well with my ""boss who is just another coworker we can talk to"". Nothing ever got better. Then more job responsibilities got thrown on me. I naturally got close to the newest person because she was training me on her job. Then the bullying went to me as well. Silence at lunch. Ignoring me. Making comments that were specific to me without saying my name. The worst part is that any clinic or other department hated working with them because they knew how awful they were. 

The new department girl had went to HR numerous times. They did an investigation and I was brought in. Said everything and I felt great for the first time in a long time. I refused to sign anything. They finished the investigation and said one of the terrible people ""was a nice lady"". More people complain. Nothing happened. I was coming home angry or crying. Then I couldn't walk. I went to work on the last day I ever went and almost fell 3 times before getting to my desk. I called my dr and got to see her that same day. Told my boss I had to go (which I had expressed to her I was going numb several times and nothing was done) and she was ok with it. Also her assistant (who was nothing but kind) quit as well and said she had enough. 

(Want to mention to my boss is no saint. She had HR have a meeting with my entire department after just me and her having a meeting. I was upset over everything and needed a day off. She told HR I yelled at her and called her names and just so many lies. They came up and she screamed and yelled and did everything except call me out personally. She said everything we talked about privately to everyone. I was firm, but not yelling and I don't curse when I met with her).

Got put on FMLA and at the end found out it wasn't a relapse, but just stress exacerbation.  I had seen several dr with various issues and they all said stress. Psoriasis? Stress. Foot pain (after an Xray and MRI) stress. Everything was because of dealing with this. I did go back to get my stuff after my MRI (because I knew I was done) and just going into that office threw me into a panic attack. I'll never forget when I went in there was no ""hellos"" or ""how are you"" just stares really quick and back to the computer monitor. Going into that hospital for medicine is a nightmare. I love everyone in that hospital and they are so great, but just the thought of seeing them terrifies me. Just even looking down the corridor to my office sends me into a panic.

My biggest issue is the flashbacks with the events that happened. Or just remembering how I felt. A lot I left out because this is already long. I'm doing so much better, but this is just consuming so much of my life and I do my best to move on, but I just can't. I've also told my primary dr about my depression from it and find it hard to just enjoy hobbies I use to love (working on this). The smallest bit of justice is that my father is good friends with a member of the medical board for the hospital and he talked to him. He immediately called for a meeting that happened earlier today (expressing just my story). My other friend who went through the worst was so happy just to hear it happened.

224,Is this a trauma response??,"I recently started questioning if it is normal to feel the way I do, and I don't know if it is. Let me begin by saying my Dad is the sweetest man ever, he loves me like a normal father and daughter and has given me everything and more in life. He would be devastated if he knew how I felt, and I truly know he would never do anything weird to me but...

  
\- I get absolutely squeamish and my skin crawls whenever he touches me, e.g. holding my hand, hugging me, or putting his arm around my shoulder. There is nothing I hate more than that, and I don't know why. I'm not like this with others. 

  
\- I feel so uncomfortable around him when I'm in a bikini (e.g. on a family beach day). I hate knowing that he has eyes and can see my body, even though it isn't in a weird way.

  
\- He walked into my room not long ago without knocking and I had just come out of the shower and was fully naked. He instantly walked out but I just wanted to cry so bad after that. I felt disgusted and violated that he'd seen me like that, even though he didn't mean to. 

  
\- My dad used to smack my butt when I was really little, in a playful and innocent way. I never saw anything wrong with it. Until one day he did it (I think I was around 12-13, I can't really remember) and I told him ""Dad, stop, I'm too old for you to be doing that now"", and I just remember him getting so pissed off at me for ""making it seem like that"", but he never did it again after. I thought it was normal for dads to do that until I searched on reddit, and everyone says it is not normal.

  
\- I was SA'd at 15 not by a family member, and I don't know if that is what causes me to feel this way, but I just don't understand why it would make me feel this towards my dad?

  
Overall, I don't think its just my dad I feel this way to. I think it's towards any male family member, but of course my dad is the only one I live with and therefore I don't experience physical contact with other males in my family. I never considered Sexual Assault in my childhood because I remember having a perfect childhood, no abuse, loving parents, great family; and maybe that was the case. But what is this unexplainable squeamish feeling I have and is it normal? What if my brain blocked out these events from my childhood, and how will I know if something happened or not?

225,Need Advice on Helping Girlfriend With Past Sexual Trauma (and dealing with it myself),"To start, I’m sorry about the huge message.

Me (29M White) and my girlfriend (23F East Asian) have been dating for a little more than a year and a half and have been living together for a little more than the past year. (Races do come into this some so I’ve included them). I know that moving in that fast is crazy, it wasn’t really an official move in she just came home from a vacation and was staying at my place and we just slowly moved more and more of her stuff over. She still has her own place.

Issue:
I’ve been having a lot of issues with the lack of physical intimacy in our relationship. At first it was great she matched my energy on everything and it was some of the best sex I’ve ever had. Since I’ve met her I really have considered her one of the most beautiful girls I’ve ever met.

The thing is she has some serious sexual trauma… her parents would have sex in the same bed as her in her early teens when they thought that she was sleeping and she learned the protection response of just pretending to be asleep/freezing up and pretending not to be there.

Then that was continued in college when she got her first boyfriend who would force himself on her when her saying no or even covering her parts he’d keep going… I think she stayed with him out of like a sense of duty (this is what you’re supposed to do with a boyfriend) but she was not ready and she says the year and a half they were together she had consensual sex with him once…

I believe all of this has lead to her having this self proclaimed inverse relationship between physical intimacy and emotional intimacy. So the closer she gets to me the more her trauma kicks in on the physical side… so we went from not knowing eachother very well and having an amazing physical relationship to having a meaningful emotional relationship but a painful physical relationship for both of us…

It’s not just disinterest, it’s almost a revulsion… like it’s gross to her and even past that her brain just can’t handle it… like there’s been times I’ve tried initiating something and I’ll touch her and she’ll just start laughing maniacally… and it’s not just sex it’s also like making out or just passionate kisses… I get passionate kisses occasionally when I do something good… I feel like a dog just waiting for a treat of just passion 😅

I’m embarrassed to say it but the lack of physical intimacy drives me crazy… I start to get more irritable and my eyes start wandering when I’m at the gym or elsewhere wondering about the other girls around… I don’t want to be I really do love her, but my needs just aren’t being met…

She’ll try to make it better she’ll jerk me off to try to make things better and she seems to be ok with that as long as she’s not involved… sometimes she’ll even pretend that she wants sex because she knows that’s what I really want and I’m sad to say as starved as I am for physical intimacy I get talked into it almost every time even though I think it hurts her mentally and physically because she like tightens up so much because of the stress about it… then I feel kindof better because of the sex but then also horrible for hurting her… but at this point for sexual stuff involving both of us penetrative and non penetrative is down to around once every 4-6 weeks and it’s driving me crazy!!

And it’s so tough with her being as attractive as she is… I feel like one of my ways of showing how attractive she is is physical intimacy, but also I don’t want to make moves on that and hurt her… so I’m like driven towards her but also I feel like a monster for wanting those things… sometimes I get turned on and I’m just like I’ve gotta get out of here and I’ll go play video games or something just to disconnect and try to ignore my attraction to her… then she doesn’t feel attractive and I’m so messed up and confused on everything and it hurts…

On her side she like has these fantasy’s and stuff, but she’s terrified of doing any of that with me… and she’s like maybe if it were with someone I don’t know… some of it is she wants to be seen as a gui bow bow (probably butchered that spelling) or good girl to someone like me she’s getting serious with… but I don’t want that… I want her good girl side and her bad girl side… And also it hurts so much to know that she wants these things but her mind has turned to it being disgusting to do that with me…

I’ve had many talks with her about it but it kindof turns into a you don’t think I’m enough. We can have all these amazing things going for us but you’re going to throw that away just because of sex… and if we go deep on things she goes into trauma response mode and will just go to sleep. If we try to have the talk somewhere she needs to be standing up she’ll practically pass out…

Her parents are very traditional Asian and are very much under the burry that shit mentality about mental health and don’t support her going to a therapist. At one point she told me she was afraid of being disowned if she went to a therapist… I know they care for her but it’s in a very controlling very don’t stop pretending everything is fine sort of way…

At one point I got us setup at a couples therapist that way it was on my insurance and didn’t trace back to her in any way, but she wouldn’t bring up any of the trauma stuff. She focused more on the maybe she just need to sleep with more people side and take care of those curiosities… To which I tell her I really don’t want to break up, but if we need to break up so you can explore stuff that’s fine, I just can’t guarantee I’m going to be here when she gets through her exploratory phase and unless she deals with this trauma I don’t want to put myself back into that same scenario… and then it just goes back to the she doesn’t want to break up either.

As a side note she did have solo sessions with the therapist so she didn’t have to worry about be being there.

There are a lot of amazing parts of our relationship. It’s just this seems to be torpedoing a lot of it for me and it’s gotten to the point where my friends are worrying about me and how it’s affecting me…

I try to work with her on trying to get her help or figuring this out, but the shutting down is making it very difficult and with her issues with therapists I don’t think we can get her the professional help that this situation needs…

I just need advice on how to help her and help us before we fall apart… sorry for the wall of text…",1715366271.0,False,1,2,Technical_Horror_741,None,1cowpa5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cowpa5/need_advice_on_helping_girlfriend_with_past/

227,Is trauma the reason I have little emotions as an adult?,"I'm a 23F who has a very difficult time naturally socializing with people. Whether it's co-workers or family— I never laugh at what everyone else is laughing at. I'm always faking a smile and feigning interest. I'm always a bit bored and tired during gatherings. I often don't even have thoughts or natural replies when people speak to me, I just nod and smile.

It's really difficult to see my co-workers chatting, smiling and giggling about things while I just stand there unrelating. I feel like an extreme outlier. 

However, when I'm alone with my boyfriend of 9 years, I am like a ray of goofiness and happiness. I talk nonstop about any and everything. We make each other laugh constantly and I honestly can barely talk to him without a smile (not exaggerating). I am a flood of positive emotions. However, if another person enters the room I instantly go quiet and almost disassociate. 

I feel like these intense changes in my emotions isn't normal.

I'm not sure why I am like this, but I did go through pretty intense trauma as a teenager. My single mother was heavily disabled starting when I was 12. I had to take care of her and it was hard for the both of us. She committed suicide when I was 16 in the room over with a gun. I saw her there and had to call the police. I've been living with my boyfriend and his family ever since and he is my best friend and rock. I had a big support system and I believe I healed fairly well. 

In recent years the last of my immediate family (older brother and grandma) both died rather abruptly as well.

I can't help but wonder if my extreme difficultly in socializing comes from that trauma. I desperately yearn to be normal and to laugh, joke and talk at family gatherings.
