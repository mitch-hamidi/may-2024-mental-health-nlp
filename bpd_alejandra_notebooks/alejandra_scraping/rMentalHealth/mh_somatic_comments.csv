0,"This is the first time I have seen someone so accurately describe my situation. 

(May be trigger warnings in the 1st 2 paragraphs)

For me, it got to the point that my somatic OCD tries to sabotage every positive experience there is. For example, when I‚Äôm watching a show that I love and a really good part is about to come on, my mind shatters all attention off the screen and focuses on wanting me to re arrange something in the desk that might not be perfectly in place, so I lose a lot of the authentic enjoyment from the scene/show sometimes. Even when I completely ignore it and let the thought pass, it still puts my mind in a state of unease where I can‚Äôt focus/enjoy the show for those moments

It even started affecting my speech now which I never thought would happen. Now when I‚Äôm trying to articulate something properly in a conversion,  my mind gets scared by the thought of messing up my words and I lose my train of thought mid convo which makes me sound inarticulate. The scariest realisation to me was that ocd can actually mess up my performance especially when it matters (because that‚Äôs when you care the most so it‚Äôs a feeding ground for OCD) which makes it much harder to accept. But I learned I‚Äôll have to accept and be ok with performance dips to truly overcome it.

In terms of the focus, I had the same situation, and I was just accepting of the fact that I may not be able to read or absorb text as fast as I‚Äôd like because of ocd interference and was fully ok with that. Now it rarely shows up

I believe the only way to deal with this is to accept anything and everything it throws, no matter how difficult, and be ok with living like that for the rest of your life

Feel free to ask anything about this",kingmystic17,15dtdds
1,"Hey I‚Äôm just seeing this, thanks so much for the reply! Im glad we can relate, it‚Äôs very grounding, and I‚Äôm very happy to announce that I‚Äôm doing MUCH better since I made this post, but my ocd has moved onto something elseüòÖ recently hit a new low where ocd has made me unable to enjoy any of my hobbies whihc has threw me into a very deep depressive mood, but I‚Äôm getting better there too. I can‚Äôt believe how creative ocd can be. So I‚Äôm still in a pretty crappy place just not nearly as bad. I‚Äôve been sticking with erp! Like you said, you just have to let it happen, accept this ‚Äúnew life‚Äù. 
Also, everything you described here I experience just in a different way. Ocd fears about being unable to enjoy things, and having difficulty articulating speech and thought process while trying to talk with people. It feels so tragic. But you know what‚Ä¶apart of me is almost thankful for this excruciating experience, because the reality is that we have a disorder. Obsessive compulsive disorder. This disorder is going to be with us for the rest of our lives, and saying or thinking things like ‚ÄúI wish things could be the way they were before‚Äù loses its meaning once you realize that ocd can show you the most dreadful horrid fears at any given point in your life. So I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs showing me now, because I feel so much better equipped to deal with whatever it may show me in the future. I mean it really struck me down this past month, debilitated me, got me to a place that I could never imagine getting better in on my own. But dammit I‚Äôm doing it! It‚Äôs not perfect and regression is to be expected, but I‚Äôve come a long way. I hope this is encouraging üòÖ.",ahuman996,15dtdds

0,The Somatic Nervous System is built up of various nerve systems that correlate mostly to skeletal muscles and skin. It allows for reflexes and contractions. If someone has a disorder that affects this system then that‚Äôs indeed what it would be called. There is a psychiatrist disorder that also uses the word Somatic which goes by Somatization disorder. This involves an unnaturally severe effect from a physical ailment or a perceived physical ailment. Doctors are unable to substantiate all of the symptoms and the patient will usually go years with the same set of complaints. Given many people have chronic pain it is hard to differentiate between what the individual is perceiving and the realty. It‚Äôs verified once everything checks out as clear or there is an underlining issue but it can‚Äôt be causing all of the issues the patient states. There will also be a history of them experiencing said issue or set of issues for years with no further substantiative evidence of their claims. The Disorder is treated by a psychiatrist while an issue with the somatic system is treated by the respected specialist. This is highly oversimplified but I don‚Äôt have a lot of time to elaborate right now. ,,8n1i2m

0,My experience was very good compared to others. I think it depends on the other people like patients in there majority but the nurses can be a little extra sometimes. If you need it you really need to focus on yourself fr it‚Äôs usually worth it even if it feels bad during or after,Dragonfly_TAP,1c602al
1,"Most of my experiences were negative in the moment, but positive overall. The main purpose of inpatient is actually just stabilisation‚Äîat least, that's what it's like here. They focus on getting you to a point where you are no longer a danger to yourself and/or others. They may also emphasise long-term care, but making you feel better *enough* is what they aim for, not making you feel *good.*

I can't guarantee that you will feel better after discharge. It is true that many people have felt worse after discharge, and I was also abused during my stays. 

But I think what you can bank on is the patients being more caring than you'd expect. Yes, there can be a lot of violence, particularly if you are in a male ward. Female wards tend to be calmer, but it's still not uncommon for there to be fights. Mixed sex wards seem to be the most stable, in my opinion. Also, sometimes they separate people who are more likely to be aggressive into a separate unit. I have experience with all types because I am transgender and psychotic (most hospitals I went to grouped psychotic patients with aggressive patients), and regardless of where I was, I've always got support from the other patients. The staff may not care if you're in a crisis (although there are definitely some that do), but the patients almost certainly will. 

There was someone who had a service dog who coincidentally was trained for a condition I had, and she let her comfort and try to pull me out of the attack. Another time, I was having a psychotic episode, and a patient stayed up all night to talk to me, even though later she said she had no idea what I was saying. 

As for good staff stories, I had a nurse comfort me while I was catatonic before she administered my medicine. Another time, a tech stayed with me for literal hours just comforting me while I was having a flashback. 

There is one hospital I went to that was a 100% good experience. This was the hospital that I had the flashback in and the tech comforted me. Not only did they allow you to go out of your room at any time, they had a 24/7 snack bar and didn't even have fences when we went outside. When my family visited, I had an anxiety attack and they escorted me back to the unit, comforting me and reassuring me that I wasn't obligated to see them and I was not inconveniencing them. The group therapy was also very good, and the unit was kept clean. 

So, yes, it's very common that inpatient is a terrible experience, but it's not unheard of that it could be a good one as well, or at the very least, useful. 

I'm sorry to hear you have to go and I understand it is scary. I hate going inpatient every time, and I have been inpatient more times than I can remember. I can't make any promises to you, but I hope you get the help and support you need.

Edit: Spelling.",TheJackdaws,1c602al
2,"I had a fairly decent experience for what it was. It didn't feel great because of the circumstances that led me to that point. But the actual hospital itself wasn't terrible (besides the constant misdiagnosis of BPD in the ER). Were there aggressive patients? Ya. But you'll find that with any psych hospital because it comes with that territory. If someone does get in your face, report it to staff and try to not piss the patient off further if you can. If it gets really bad, it's completely appropriate to set boundaries and walk away from the situation.

Staff wasn't too bad. Granted, I wasn't a problematic patient and was easy to deal with. Though, I work in healthcare so I know what not to do. I never ran into a major issue or conflict with staff. 

Do I have bad memories from my stay? Absolutely I do. That's mostly because I was miserable due to my circumstance and wanting to kill myself nonstop. I will say that it's definitely a thing where you come out different than when you came in. It does change you. Whether it's for the better or worse depends on what make of it.",throw0OO0away,1c602al
3,"I had a good experience myself. I checked myself in willingly because I was worried I‚Äôd hurt myself and my therapist recommended it as they could get me started on meds immediately as opposed to having to wait for an appointment with the psychiatrist. 

I was in a mixed ward for adults.  They weren‚Äôt full at the time so I didn‚Äôt have to share a room.  We didn‚Äôt have anyone violent there as they had a separate area for those who were a little more unstable.  All the nurses were very nice and understanding. They did daily check ins with you individually so you can express to them your concerns or just how you are feeling in general.  

We could ask the nurses for snacks if we got hungry and the snack bar wasn‚Äôt out.  

The patients that were there with me were all very nice.  We had a younger crowd so there was a lot of energy.  When I left we were getting some older folks and the tone was definitely quieter.  I still think of the people I met there and wonder how they are doing.

1,"Your doctor has no reason to lie to you or give you a false diagnosis. That being said, if you don‚Äôt trust this doctor, it‚Äôs perfectly fine for you to talk to another. For your Zyprexa, the primary indication is schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but there are many off-label indications such as anxiety, nausea and insomnia. 

Being a psychiatrist is part art and part science. Your doctor is recommending a drug they believe will relieve as many symptoms as possible. We get referred to psychiatrists because there are many many drugs out there and they know the interactions and side effects better than other doctors. 

A lot of times it takes a couple weeks for your body to get used to the medication. It‚Äôs very common to have side effects. You can talk to a pharmacist or your doctor about what to expect. Very important though is to talk to your doctor if your side effects are too severe; you often need to taper off medications so you don‚Äôt have violent mood swings or withdrawal symptoms. 

If you have questions, don‚Äôt be shy about talking to a doctor or a nurse. Remember you are paying them for care. If you don‚Äôt understand something, have questions or don‚Äôt feel comfortable, let them know.",AnotherEpicFail,17a3tow

1,"I think I lived inside a void of anxiety all of 2020 because of COVID, so I sympathize. I too had a triggering time period before COVID where everyone in my family took turns getting really sick. When COVID happened I was \*not ready\* to deal with it.

Anyways, I thought I'd share this technique I have for dealing with triggers. It's a journal entry where I go through questions that help me process the event.

Here are the prompts:

- Date

- What happened? (stick to objective facts here)

- How did you feel? (emotionally, physically)

- What did you think? (you can write about assumptions you had about other people or judgements)

- What did you do? (describe any confrontation or lack of)

- What was your fantasy? (write about your ideal confrontation, including how the other people would respond)

- What was the trigger? (try to distill it down to a sentence)

- What are your thoughts on the trigger?

- What is the earliest memory (in childhood) of this trigger upsetting you?

You could add another one, like ""If you could travel back in time to your younger self, what would you say or do to protect yourself or help you manage the traumatic event?""

I think a visualization exercise could help here too. The key is to really sit with your feelings in order to move through them. An exercise I try sometimes when I deal with anxiety or fear in particular is telling myself ""it's okay if \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ happens."" Of course it's clearly NOT ok, but through the act of repeating it, I force myself through the connected emotions.

If you try any of this, let me know how it goes. Best of luck.",-63-,1cwx8rk

A Yale medical journal says that the best things for avoiding relapse from addiction are relaxation with traditional Asian methods and cognitive therapy.

The Asian method with the best evidence is slow breathing. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min in the early morning and at bedtime is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.

1,"You can always go to the doctor if it's possible. It's always good to do a check up just in case. 

But all of these also sound like regular somatic symptoms. 

When I have anxiety attack I will depersonalize and derealize which make me feel dizzy, foggy and tired. I can also get nauseous as well. 

When I get huge panic attack, I will actually feel chest pain for the next few days and even sometimes be sore and feel like I have the flu days after the actual attack (I call them panic flus). Anxiety is rough on your body, especially when you experience acute episode, and it's absolutely normal to feel it physically. 

Do you think about hydrating enough? I know I lose my appetite a lot and eating/drinking/taking care of my basic needs fall off the wagon sharply when I'm in a bad headspace. Dehydration can definitely contribute to headaches, head pressure, tiredness and nausea. 

Drinking really cold or flavored water can also help with your anxiety, because it's super grounding. I like to chew on an ice cube because I have sensitive gums and the slight pain helps me focus.",Selfconscioustheater,18y4002
2,Is it normal to experience these symptoms even on days when I am not feeling overly anxious or depressed about anything?,nathanbgerman,18y4002
3,"It's not because you don't feel emotionally anxious or depressed that you aren't. Somatic symptoms may be a way for your body to express these troubles even though you don't feel anxiety emotionally. 

Picture a bottle of water. For most people who do not have anxiety disorders, or troubles, this bottle is relatively empty. They can bottle it up, give it a good shake, and there's space for it to go. 

More stressors happens, and it fills, but there's still space.

Yours, on the daily, is 100% full. This is when you don't feel anxious or depressed. It's not overflowing, but there's no space either. If you close it up and try to shake it, there's no space for it to go. If this is your baseline, it is entirely normal to feel somatic symptoms. And when something happens that triggers more anxiety or a depressive episodes, you have no space to absorb it. So your bottle overflows and you emotionally feel the hit on top of your somatic symptoms.",Selfconscioustheater,18y4002

0,"Trauma is difficult to deal with and there's not exactly any one way to deal with it that works for everybody, but the two primary categories for dealing with it are to run from it or to fight it. On the run from it side there's hoping your mind blocks everything and never opens up the can of worms again, trying to remain as relaxed as possible, avoiding any potential triggers, ""faking it til you make it"", helping other people with their problems instead of facing your own, and a bunch of other methods that I can't think of right off the top of my head, but I know they exist. This tends to be the camp that I stay in, but it's also often seen as the ""unhealthy"" way of dealing. On the other side (the fight side) you process your emotions, talk through everything with your therapist, do a bit of research into why you have the stress reactions you do, and replace any negative reactions you have with positive coping mechanisms and attitudes. There's also a bit of room to engage in both styles of dealing with trauma to resolve it, but honestly dealing with problems seems like a lot of effort and I'm significantly less interested in that personally than I am in integrating my issues into myself and using the least healthy methods I can find to deal with my issues, so I don't have much information on how to achieve the second style of dealing with trauma.",SwordoftheRevelation,gk19sw
1,"I had the same. We had no idea. I was seeing a neurologist because I would start stuttering, then go into a stupor and hit the ground, unable to move or talk. All while I had these splitting migraines. After 2 years of testing and medications, he just labeled them as complex migraines. I had hallucinations, severe dissociative episodes, overwhelming thoughts to run away. I finally got diagnosed with Dissociative PTSD during a severe mental breakdown as they stated that I most likely had been suffering with it since a child due to the symptoms I had been showing and were surprised no one had caught it. With the right combination of medications and treatments, I was able to keep them at bay. I still get headaches (I am not longer in treatment or medications, trying to get back in), but, I now focus on my body cues rather then the headaches. I do my best to not focus on the headache itself but rather what it is trying to tell me. Normally, I'm getting too stressed and I need to step away and cool off before I have an episode. You just need to learn your your triggers and body cues and learn your plan of action. Migraines hurt, the suck ass. Yet, when linked with mental disorders, they are actually trying to tell you something. Next migraine. Look around. Try and figure out why it is happening.",DeadWolffiey,gk19sw

4,"It doesn't have to be just dissociative related. Any type of trauma or mental disorder can cause your body to not act properly. For example, I was severely abused as a child, and for some odd reason, that has caused my body to not have normal periods (once every 6-9 months without birth control). They checked everything out multiple times and nothing is wrong physically... Yet, mental illness, especially trauma, changes how your body produces certain chemicals and hormones. Just like your migraines. Physically, nothing is actually wrong. Your body is just responding chemically to something that is emotional. You can block out your emotions, yet, you will still have those reactions.

Panic disorder often responds to self-help. In fact, Handbook of Self-Help Therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that of all the disorders, panic disorder is the one that‚Äôs most responsive to self-help. 

Details here - self-help and standard treatments

There's a really good YouTube channel - Asperger's from the Inside.

If you go to Metapsychology, you can read a psychologist's review of Dr Steve Ilardi's book (""a splendid book""). He's the therapist and researcher who headed the Univ of Kansas lifestyle-depression project.

Relaxation eases the symptoms of depression.

The easiest way to calm down is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min in the early morning and at bedtime is a therapy. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently through the nose, 6 seconds each.

A good habit - respond to moments of stress by breathing slowly.

I'd look into diet too if I were you. I have some similiar symptoms (not the exact same ofc but ye) and I have a gluten intolerance as well as 30 other intolerances. Never knew in my life but it might've been contributing. For me it's not changed much yet but I know for others diet change and knowing what sets your gut off might help balance things out.

I dunno about shrooms, might make it better or worse?

Most sources I read say good things for mental and physical health from shrooms so once the ssri is done I want to see if I can just, clear some cobwebs so to speak. Maybe reconnect with some spirituality :p 

Pms wise - we'll, may be a little better for you without b.c but...unless you have you're ovaries removed or something,  not alot will help AFAIK.

Outside of that: a true restorative yoga class (one with all the props and long holds) can be really beneficial to relaxation and the nervous system and that can be really nourishing and balancing for a lot of people. Mushrooms personally have taught me some amazing life lessons and shifted my world perspective, so I think plant medicine can be really powerful and impactful.

I'm just that these things can help when your mind is so frazzled you can't think straight.

Therapy will take time.

When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads. There's two ways to get rid of those thoughts.  
   
One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel OK. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each.  
When you're calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens. In a stressful situation, think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent.  
   
Don't make mountains out of molehills.  
   
When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better.  
   
Also, replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes.  
  
The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication.  
Don't overlook stress management - it can help even with very bad anxiety.

Talk, talk to everyone you love and let them be your guiding hand whenever you hit those lows. Have faith in yourself and try to look at the positives of life hereafter whenever you do something, no matter how trivial it is.

I'm not invalidating that you truly miss your ex, but reading between the lines it seems to me that you're also in need of someone to rely on and help you, which could mean that you're anxious attached, which means that you maybe suffer more when lonely and look for validation and help in others.

It's like a ""I'm not ok, you're ok"" mindset that controls the emotions and behaviour of the anxiously attached.

2) Reattribute the obsessive thoughts to a brain malfunction called OCD.

0,"Beautiful description of a terrifying experience. I was about 10 years old when I suddenly found myself sitting awake on my bed, Mom and Dad next to me trying to calm me down. I had had a nightmare, and couldn't quite shake it off yet. And I was still yelling ""wood and water"" over and over. Even though I was already awake, I would focus on the closet doors of my room and could still see them swelling infinitely. Everything was swelling around me, as had happened in my dream. Everything was overboarding itself due to its mere material existence. Over the years I can still remember the sensation, and sometimes think of it as an experience of unconventional dimensions of reality. Thank you for sharing.",paleRedSkin,9di2x3
1,"I have definitely experienced a number of things you are describing since childhood. I would cycle between feeling absolutely huge, actually in my case it was more swollen, and then very thin and twig like. I would also have this sense of weird time where things felt fast and slow and it's disturbing to experience. The sound is the worst, it sounds like all the molecules are screaming at me in some alien like fashion. 

I have these attacks a lot less frequently but the time dilation and the sound still happen more often.  I've never been able to find an explanation for it and people have a hard time grasping what I am talking about when I try to describe it.",pharaohess,9di2x3
2,"Woah. I get that this is a terrifying experience, but at the same time, this seems absolutely amazing. Not ""good"" amazing, but ""amazed"", ""awestruck"" amazing. It almost seems like you start to transcend into a fourth dimension and are suddenly conscious of the limitations of 3D that none of us can even comprehend (same sort of cramped terror one might get if they were shoved into a two dimensional plane).

While i have never taken it, i have been fascinated by DMT trips and what they might mean. These trips can also be terrifying for those unprepared for what is to come. It almost sounds like you are forcibly shoved into a similar experience, albeit much less psychedelic. I am still unconvinced that DMT is entirely in the mind, since there have been experiments that say otherwise: with two isolated subjects simultaneously tripping and having corroborating and consistent experiences despite having never even met before.",jcinto23,9di2x3
3,"Thank you for sharing this. 

I don't think my experiences are the same thing, mostly because there was no terror associated... Though there was a feeling of panic. 

I would start to notice that my hands felt abnormally large, like Mickey mouse hands. And when I touched my teeth together it was like they were huge and somehow more sensitive. Not painful just, idk more aware of my jaw closing and my top teeth coming into contact with the bottom ones. Like my mouth was as big as a football stadium and could feel that big sensation.  

Then my thoughts would go from normal to frantic. Like I'd think ""I wonder what time it is"" and the voice thinking it wouldn't be calm and normal, it would be like someone freaking out. Every single thought. Freaking out lady in my head. But the thoughts weren't different in content than usual, just screaming and panicked in tone. 

I would eventually start to feel that feeling of time moving painfully slowly while at the same time feeling like my body was working on fast forward. But I'd look down at my hands and they wouldn't be moving any differently, so that was really disorienting.

This got to happen less and less as I got older. I'm 36 now and I can't remember the last time it happened. This is the first time I've talked about it as these words don't adequately explain the experience and I feel like no one will understand what I'm trying to say. Nice to have the chance to maybe be understood, thank you. 

Edit: just looked it up and holy crap, maybe that is what I was experiencing even though I wasn't afraid during it. From wiki  
>The person affected by Alice in Wonderland Syndrome may also lose the¬†sense of time, a problem similar to the lack of spatial perspective. In other words, time seems to pass very slowly, akin to an¬†LSD¬†experience. The lack of time, and space, perspective leads to a distorted¬†sense of velocity. For example, one could be inching along ever so slowly in reality, yet it would seem as if one were sprinting uncontrollably along a moving walkway, leading to severe, overwhelming disorientation.¬†

I feel like that can be similar again but with different kinds of effects on visual perception. I only ask as that is the closest I could possibly relate to this experience and sleep paralysis is absolutely terrifying so I can only imagine AIWS must be really hard to deal with.

13,"Your writing is damn perfect to describe the experience, goddamn. I haven't had nearly as rough of a bunch of experiences as you have, thankfully. It's downright incredible to read accounts from someone else who's experiences something like I have, thought with what seems like a lot more intensity.

I had attacks from (as far as I remember) 9ish-12, and have some mild residuals now, but haven't had the full-blown version since 12. It didn't shake me quite so badly after a few years, and they never went back-to-back, thankfully. It's been burned into my memory since, here we go:

The hard/edge feeling is accurate for me, it's sorta like everything between the edges of contact between myself and the bed/blanket felt flat and just a uniform pressure rather than a texture, and the edges themselves are highlighted/oversensitive. If I'm still looking around at all, edges stand out from objects, highlighted and artifacting slightly, things don't look 2D but they look oddly thin in depth without losing perspective. The height of the ceiling or the distance to the far wall become...variable, normal at once glance and 50' away on another. Ceiling lights would glitch this once in a while, my brain knew what size it was supposed to look like, and tried to adapt a '50 feet = 5 feet' logic, this just made me dizzy so I avoided it.

Time as my body perceived it slows, physical feedback from the bed/air fades off, but mentally it's a whirlwind. I remember the ambient noise getting sucked away, replaced by a soft static-ish hiss. There was a fast feeling of deep, primal dread (where I could usually tell I wasn't just falling asleep funny) and of being forcefully sucked/backflipping through the bed itself by some incredible force. I still don't like rollercoasters that do certain motions because of that.

Maybe 1/5 times, at this point, I could mentally trash and struggle enough to get out of it (if I could get one toe to twitch and give a new touch response, I was free), and fall asleep afterwards fine, but usually not.

The feeling of force/flipping turned into acceleration, like being shoved along an infinite, wide track and gradually approaching lightspeed. Felt real enough that my chest/abs refused to breathe normally, shorter gaspy breaths. The audio parts started kicking in a bit after I got 'launched' from the bed. Random, short yelps or yells, sometimes clips from my memory, sometimes a word or two, and always stuff in either a harsh or a pleading tone. They'd get louder as the speed picked up, more urgent and aggressive, turned into some hellish symphony of head-filling screaming fights without discernible words, all feeling like they were aimed square at me. Still feeling like falling backwards at 0.8c through this bit, both volume and speed rising.

This usually lasted from 3-5 min or so to this point, and varied a bit afterwards. Most often, thanks to being in an apartment, a bang/thud from a door closing would register through this at some point, sounding like it was very far away but louder and boomier than the clusterfuck. Sometimes, my parents would notice and wake me. Either of these resulted in a 2000mph-to-0 snap back into my own head (the feeling of being back inside your own, solid skull is a weird one), body feeling fading back in, and the yelling fading quickly back into a hiss then gone. I remember several times where it just melded the feeling of the bed and ambient noise back in over top of the cacophony, which makes a quiet room seem like it's ear-splittingly loud.

In either case, that spacial deformity stuck around for a few minutes after snapping back, the floor seemed a long fall away, the door a hundred feet away but 50 feet tall. My hand in front of my face would be normal, but at arm's length kept reporting that it was possibly gigantic. The primal dread fades off, but the anxiety didn't.

Once, I remember riding through the effect, mentally bracing against whatever the hell this experience was (I was 12 and tired of it kicking my ass). The falling/acceleration feeling kept climbing after 5 min (I'm fairly sure no person has felt this level of speed in reality before), the yelling ascending to a stream of hundreds of angry, hostile sounds overlapping to where only the peaks stuck out. The screaming stopped (but not at all once), the speed didn't change, but its scale no longer mattered, because the space I felt I was floating in was infinite. I suppose outer space is the only comparable thing, just infinite black nothingness in every direction with zero perceived 'end' anywhere. I got pretty panicked about whether or not I had somehow left my body doing this, since this was a bit different. The return to the bed was a hard jolt that time,  I twitched in a way that felt like I fell into the mattress from a short distance up, but without leaving it. It wasn't the last attack, but the only one I ever had go that far.

As for the residual stuff... thankfully really mild. The spacial effect happens randomly in certain conditions (looking darker to better lit space, not much motion, and I'm tired but staying up). Edges seem a bit 'harder' along with the effect, but there's no warning to it otherwise. If I'm looking into the hallway from my desk, it'll seem 10' away then 100'  then 10' again as I look at it, keeping perspective/relative distances of things at distance unaffected. Someone standing in the doorway would be 5', then 50' tall according to what my brain is trying to tell me. This lasts for between 30 seconds or so to a few minutes, and can happen repeatedly in one night. I've gotten a bit used to it in that I can carry on a conversation while it happens, losing focus for a second as I force my brain to accept normal scale a few times.",Orange_C,9di2x3
14,"I saw this the other day and saved it but only just got round to replying.
I used to get this as a child, also mostly when I had a temperature and it was almost exclusively when I was In bed (although I would get the weird shouting in my head sometimes in the shower too later in life - I kind of feel it now weirdly just reading this)

I fully get how it would be traumatising and I‚Äôm kind of surprised it didn‚Äôt traumatise me, unless I‚Äôve just forgotten that. I have a vague recollection of feeling alone and trapped but I wouldn‚Äôt say I felt scared or anxious and if anything I would talk it up to people about how cool it was to feel my hands getting bigger and smaller.

I also used to get nightmares when I was ill, I‚Äôd be in a weird environment of cumuli coloured hills and mounds and I‚Äôd feel myself getting trapped in the valleys with the walls looming over me and the weird loud and incoherent voice shouting at me. 

It really is a strange condition and I was glad I was able to find out what it was years ago, I am surprised it hasn‚Äôt affected me more than it has, unless I haven‚Äôt realised yet.

Just last night I woke up and my head felt like it was in overdrive, no real thoughts in particular but there was some feeling whirring around and making me restless and uncomfortable. I‚Äôm wondering if this is part of it too and that is probably the symptom that has stuck with me most as I‚Äôve got older, although it is still rare that it happens 

Would love to see any links to articles or studies about this if you have found anything interesting yourself ",,9di2x3
15,"Hi all!  And hello Tiger Widow :)  Thanks to everybody who shared their stories!  Count me among those that experience this strange phenomenon.    
I thought I would offer my story because I had some really fascinating things happen to me as my comfort with the sensations evolved over time.  I'll try to keep it short and to the point.  


I can't recall exactly when the symptoms began, it must have been 8 years old or so.  Typical manifestation to what many here have already said; terrifying sensations of being impossibly large and impossibly small at the same time.  The impossible part was an important descriptor because part of the panic I felt as a child was in the sense that what simply could NOT be, actually was, though it felt so wrong.  In addition to the bodily sensations, environmental feedback, intense bad dreams, sleep walking and talking... I had the strong internal visual of what I called a ""black ball"" (my mother said I'd be speaking of it while sleeping quite often). All this occurred for me at the same time in my young life, an otherwise normal and healthy life in a happy home.  Eventually, after some months of trouble while adults shrugged their shoulders at what descriptions I could add to my parents observations, the sensations eased and I had regular sleeps again.  


Frequently over the years the sensations would return, mostly when I was tired, to varying degrees of intensity, sometimes overwhelming, as it was at first, but sometime slightly less so.  What I noticed was that I was becoming more comfortable with it.  As a teenager I even began to invoke it intentionally to see how 'deep' I could get with it.  There was a definite increase in it's intensity if I could focus on it and relax into it.     
I understand that part might sound a little crazy for some of you, being that overall it was a very unpleasant sensation.  I totally get that... I can only say that for me, once I stopped resisting the sensations, it meshed well enough with my psyche and wasn't SO foreign perhaps because of the vivid and occasionally quite odd dreams I had been having as a kid.   Perhaps worth mentioning is that I have been a very active dreamer through my life and able to have lucid dreams from an early age and such.  I suspect that there are correlations between this and AIWS.  


Here's the part I thought important to add to the conversation: Time goes on and as a young man in my twenties  (I'm 42 now) I was still able to invoke the sense of stillness that comes with the size perception distortion and other hard to describe sensory feedback - sometimes it would still come on it's own, mostly as I lay in bed ready for sleep.   One winter night, I lay in bed suffering terribly with a bad infection in both ears.  I was very feverish and as often happens for me when I am exhausted and feverish my mind got stuck in a sort of a loop.  Does this happen to anyone else?  It can be such a nightmare... a repeating thought or feeling, over and over, throughout the night only changing a little here and there... quite the test of sanity for a person already feeling quite sick.     
So!  This night, as I lay drifting into my feverish sleep the Alice symptoms settled strongly into place and this sensation became what my mind looped into.  Over and over through the night, like some kind of sense mantra, my mind stayed fixed on this feeling.  It was very intense, to a new level and I even began to perceive the 'black ball' that my mom said I used to fearfully talk about.  As the night wore on, this black ball became more of a focus and I could see it more and more clearly or I approached it closer and closer.  Eventually, still looped into the AIWS sensation, I could actually see that the black ball was an immensely large knot, tied into itself like a monkeyfist with no ends showing.  


I realize this gets a bit far out there but bear with me.  I am an otherwise normal person... haha  


I had a very strong impulse to get closer to the knot, to untie it perhaps but as I got 'nearer' to it I could feel that it was impossible to do so.  Here I felt a forced coming together with the black ball, with this knot, and as I felt myself enter into a sort of overlapping with it, however cheesy or fantastic it sounds, I gained a new perspective that automatically led to a simultaneous bonding with it and an untying of myself.    
The sensation that followed is harder to describe.  I sensed something feminine, and the certainty that all the answers to whatever question that exists were here, in this place where the knot once was.  As reassuring as this feeling was, as beautiful and transcendent, it didn't last very long... I could feel that my self was unable to occupy this space, got scared and retracted post haste.  I pulled back from it, sensing the knot again as I withdrew, got outta bed and wandered the house for a few minutes, still totally feverish, feeling the AIWS symptoms subsiding and not perfectly clear on my sense of self.  It all came back to me in short order.  


I realize that must sound hokey to some.  I'm out of free time to share for the moment.  I can say a bit more about it so perhaps I'll pop back in a while and see if anyone has bothered to read through and wants me to continue.     


Thanks again Tiger Widow!

  
",TheCuriousApathy,9di2x3
16,"Well said. I've had these experiences in some form or another. The feeling of everything being so far away, the room, my hands, every object elongated and zoomed out. The rushy feeling of reality moving faster then comprehension. The bombardment of many voices speaking all at once. And Yes, it was much more intense during fevers. I remember feeling like I was going mad during times when I was sick. My mind overwhelmed with some unknown rush of stimuli  that couldn't be vocalized or described to any sensible accuracy. It was usually in the dark for me but there were times I had to turn the light on to try to get the episodes to subside or feel some kind if physical normalcy. ",cosmicdreams34,9di2x3
17,"That sounds like a fairly similar state of perception. If I can provide some insight into what you experienced regarding what I've learned about my condition:

What you're describing sounds like Macropsia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macropsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macropsia)) which is one of the components of an attack of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. It can effect different senses, touch, sight, hearing, and seems to be something to do with a breakdown in a proper gauging of proportionality.

There's an area of your brain that's called the TPO-C, which is the crossroad of temporooccipital, parietooccipital, and temporoparietal junctions (TOJ, POJ, and TPJ). TPO-C is where visual and somatosensory information are integrated to generate the inner and external representation of self. An episode of micropsia in children being tested with AIWS has revealed contemporary hypoactivation in occipital lobe and hyperactivation in the right superior parietal cortex.

Think of it as an extremely strange form of epilepsy - type - occurance that interferes with the brains ability to integrate visual, audible and somatosensory input. This area of the brain seems, at least anecdotally, to under certain conditions have some form of small misfiring in otherwise normal people. There seems to be widespread accounts of people experiencing one or two moments of this as children. It's possible then that quite a significant portion of people have experienced, fleetingly at least, some aspect of the symptoms AIWS sufferers experience episodically. It sounds like this could be what happened to you.

Again, this is more likely to occur in childhood (and also seems to be largely triggered around the sleep onset stage) as it's much less prevalent in adults, even for those that had previously experienced many episodes in childhood. I've had maybe 3 (lets say 2 and a half) episodes in the past 11 years. though more than I could care to remember between childhood and mid-late adolescence.

But if that gives you some insight into how it functions, I hope that's maybe given you some clarity on that. Of course I could be wrong but that's what sense I can make of what your experience sounds like.",Tiger_Widow,9di2x3
18,"It's amazing how many others in the AIWS communities I've found that have exactly the same experience as this. As was my story too. Spending, well, 25 years now (beginning at 6, I'm now 31) having great difficulty explaining the nature of this thing to others, and trying to get some answers. Never getting any. And finally being bought into contact with this not very well understood neurological condition. And suddenly having a whole set of people knowing exactly what I'm talking about. And a load of literature explaining what's actually happening.

You should maybe look into Alice in Wonderland Syndrome yourself. It's commonly cited that this is massively under-diagnosed due to the nature of how it works, how little known the condition is, and how difficult it is to bridge that gap for people that experience these kinds of weird symptoms.

There are various kinds of things that can trigger this stuff. Migrains are a predominant factor, as are forms of temporal lobe epilepsy, or viral infections. Often though it appears on it's own and fades away as sufferers get older. It's not that well understood really, other than there's a definite set of criteria that are symptomatic of the syndrome and diagnosis is generally predicated on the account of the sufferer's description of their episodes.",Tiger_Widow,9di2x3
19,You have reached two cuil.,jcinto23,9di2x3
20,"Well I've done different psychedelics in my heyday and I can definitely say that this is very different to that. It comes from a different 'place' entirely. What's happening at the technical level during an episode is a malfunction in the ability to properly integrate visual-spatial and somatosensory information in the TPO-C region of the brain.

The experience is essentially the internal subjective manifestation of a breakdown in the minds proper ability to integrate spacial temporal somatic visual etc information into a unified comprehension of reality. So everything becomes paradoxical, infinitely big and small, fast and slow, loud and quiet, soft and hard e.t.c. It becomes both at once and neither. It's very discombobulated and honestly, terrifying. The room doesn't go anywhere, things don't physically change, but your veritable *understanding* of how things fit together, and your core level *sense* of how things are, alters in an extremely difficult to handle and very dizzying and panic inducing way.

There's no merit to be had from the experience. It may seem awe-some as it were, and I appreciate that sentiment. but a better description for it would be *completely overwhelming,* not in any way that you could gain any value from it after the fact. It is very much like entering some kind of twisted hell dimension. The words I used to describe the situation are still not properly adequate to really represent what it's actually like to have an episode. But they are the closest I can manage at least to attempt to convey what it's like. The experience itself is, as with life, actually a fluid continuum of sense of self and surroundings, all-be-it one that shifts, during an episode, into an incredibly scary mode of being. My writing above attempts to describe that experience through description metaphor and allegory, but it is not those things.

I have through the years actually gone through many of those sophistic musings about what the nature of the experience must be coming from, and it's been, I suppose, daunting, to carry around those possibilities as to what's been happening to me (and something to which I've inevitably ended up cycling through the mental health system trying to answer, possible co-morbidity notwithstanding, but that's another story). So honestly it's been a massive saving grace to find out that it's as simple as a misfiring of certain areas of the brain. I'm ok with that, it's far easier to deal with than the kind of set up's I alluded to in my opening paragraph in the OP.",Tiger_Widow,9di2x3
21,"Thank you so much for coming forwards with that and sharing your experiences too. As for the panic <-> terror. I think these types of semantics can be largely subjective. I personally found my experiences to be terrifying, but other accounts range from no to low anxiety, to moderate to severe panic to extreme. It's different for different people, and I suppose largely to do with the ability for the experiencer to emotionally handle the nature of the episodes.

As I've mentioned in other replies AIWS is commonly considered to be widely under-diagnosed due to it being largely unknown in the medical literature. It's a very niche and under discussed condition that may actually have afflicted many more people than has been officially quantified.

There is a large spectrum of sensory distortions and abnormalities that fall under the umbrella of possible experiencers of AIWS episodes, see here -> [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4909520/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4909520/)

It can manifest in various ways for each person and the combination of elements varies widely between individuals, though there is a distinct set of criteria that underpins the range of symptom combinations.

A lot of what you've described not only rings true to my experiences as a child, but fits this general category too. Think of ""AIWS"" as a *way of understanding the weirdness*.  A **syndrome** is simply a set of medical signs and symptoms that are correlated with each other. So *Alice in wonderland - Syndrome.* Is a way of medically quantifying the accounts of people that have this specific kind of weird, mind bending episodes.

Maybe you would also like to look through the google group to see if any of the other accounts ring any bells for you. -> [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/alice-in-wonderland-syndrome](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/alice-in-wonderland-syndrome)

I'm glad my post has hit home for you with something you've probably had a lot of trouble processing and placing over the years (I'm certainly very familiar with that notion), and I hope, if you choose to look into the literature some more you may find some answers there too. It's personally been very healing for me to find out this is what's been going on. That there's a name for it and others that have gone through the same e.t.c.",Tiger_Widow,9di2x3
22,">Then my thoughts would go from normal to frantic. Like I'd think ""I  wonder what time it is"" and the voice thinking it wouldn't be calm and  normal, it would be like someone freaking out. Every single thought.  Freaking out ~~lady~~ boy in my head. But the thoughts weren't different in  content than usual, just screaming and panicked in tone.

I also have to point out that along with your description of time weirding out, the above quote so accurately describes my internal headspace during an episode. I've noticed too that it was different from just ""being panicked"" There were times in my teens where I could keep myself *relatively* calm during a freakout, but one of the prominent factors of it was my head was doing this weird frantic thing that you describe here. It wasn't really associated with my sense of fear or panic at all, it was more of a switch into this manic mental state. The way you describe it here explains it well.

So thank you for sharing that with me too.",Tiger_Widow,9di2x3

24,"Thanks, I really appreciate your sentiment, and thank you for you kind words :)  


I hope in some small way this can go to help someone else out, because the worst part about it for me has been not knowing what it was and why it was happening for so many years. If there are others out there that are in the same boat, maybe if they come across this it'll give them the same lifeline I received.  


Because I really wouldn't want anyone else to go through what I did on their own as well.",Tiger_Widow,9di2x3
25,"Thankyou for you kind words, and yes! These episodes can be extremely intense. It is a very unusual thing, that complete lack of a sense of how much time has passed, because it literally feels like forever in some horribly direct sense. And it can take a while to get your head round only a few minutes having gone by.

I also have vivid memories of crying at my mum that she was shouting/being loud or otherwise sounding like she was really frightened. 

It is indeed an incredibly weird experience, and I'm only glad that I've been able to discover the name of this beast, so to speak, and to find others that have gone through the same sort of set of symptoms. There's something very healing in that, because up until very recently, I thought this only happened to me.

It's been especially healing in being able to quantify all the aspects of it properly through the medical literature and accounts of other's experiences and developing a proper set of conceptual tools to begin unpacking those extremely disorientating experiences.

I'm glad you've been able to relate to my depiction. For me it's very much been like finding a really important piece to a puzzle of a really confusing part of my life experience. So it's all a healing process. :)",Tiger_Widow,9di2x3
26,"Thankyou, I'm glad it helped!",Tiger_Widow,9di2x3
27,"Honestly not at all. Everything about the experience is absolutely terrifying. There's something about it that taps right into the core of the amygdala. Sheer unadulterated terror. At least for me. I know others that experience the symptoms can variate on how anxiety inducing it can be, from not at all, to mild, to devastatingly terrifying. It's something to do with which parts of the brain is triggered, or so I've read. Sadly I'm on the latter part of the spectrum. So it's never been anything but incredibly difficult to handle. For years it was misdiagnosed as panic attacks (much to my protestation that It wasn't panic attacks). for me, panic is so intrinsically interwoven with the onset and episode that it would be impossible for me to garner anything positive from the attacks. And when I say panic, I mean the most potent form of panic. Fear for you life, sanity, desperation type of panic. Overwhelming waves of nauseating terror and something you really have to fight to keep from completely overtaking you while an episode is happening. It's honestly not something I'd wish on anyone and can be very exhausting.

If they never happened ever again and I forgot all about them, I would be very happy about that, and I'm hoping such a thing occurs eventually. It's been quite a while since my last blip, shall we say. I haven't had a full blown attack in over a decade, and only 3 sort of *wobbles* over the past long while, I'm hoping it's very much behind me by now. People with AIWS tend to grow out of the majour episode stage of things, and it seems to be the case with me. But I still frequently get momentary blips of things not fitting together properly for an instant, but that's really nothing in comparison to the kind of attacks I had in my younger years.

&#x200B;",Tiger_Widow,9di2x3
28,"To be honest this sounds different to AIWS. seeing people that aren't there isn't one of the symptoms here. This is more to do with a discombobulation of the sense of time, scale and proportionality in the visual, somatosensory etc domains.",Tiger_Widow,9di2x3
29,"Yeah it seems from the literature that it's quite common in a general context to happen, to varying degrees, to people in a transient manner. Usually in childhood and often during fever. Once or twice type of thing. I've read that it's possible that about 30% of the population have experienced some form of AIWS like episode at least once. It's very close in nature to the delirium state.  


And yes, it's not nice to have it recur periodically out of the blue, when you're watching tv, playing the computer, reading a book or, more often than not, trying to fall asleep. I'm actually very relieved that you grow out of it. Before I found that out I've been going about with a palpable sense of apprehension about when it might next occur, though in a way I could never quite verbalize or conceptualize properly to myself. It has over the years become quite intrinsic to certain phobias I have about certain textural, audible or visual propertional relations between things. If people speak too quickly all of a sudden, or I touch something too thin, like a headphone wire, I get pangs of anxiety and for a moment feel a glimpse of it again, mistaking the sensation to be another onset.  


Luckily It hasn't actually happened now for a long time, barring a few minor particularly strong 'blips'. the most recent of which actually triggered me to go back to therapy. But that's another story!",Tiger_Widow,9di2x3
30,"Funnily enough. I used to get sleep paralysis around the same time the AIWS episodes were at their most frequent, about age 9 or 10. So that's quite interesting you bring that up.

During your panic attacks did you experience any: 

palisomesthesia: (http://inhn.org/cn/home/cordoba-unit/education/carlos-morra-and-ernst-franzek-psychopathological-symptoms/palisomesthesia.html)

Quick Motion Phenomenon: (http://hallucinations.enacademic.com/1610/quick-motion_phenomenon)

Or any form of dysmetropsia https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dysmetropsia

And would you conclude that the panic attacks bought about these experiences, or would you say that the experiences bought about the panic? That is to say, do you think you were panicking because things were going weird, or that you were panicking, and things were also going weird? In respect to order of causality?

I'm interested in this, because for years I was told what happened to me was ""panic attacks"" and for a long while that's what I thought they were, until I had a bought of *actual* panic attacks and realised that they were almost completely bodily sensory / a totally different type of attack, and not nearly as vividly so perceptually altering like these other episodes had always been. though obviously panic was so central to the stuff in general, it wasn't until I was particularly introspective about it all that I managed to notice that distinction.

So I'm interested in probing your experiences a bit more.",Tiger_Widow,9di2x3
31,"**Macropsia**

Macropsia (also known as megalopia) is a neurological condition affecting human visual perception, in which objects within an affected section of the visual field appear larger than normal, causing the person to feel smaller than they actually are.  Macropsia, along with its opposite condition, micropsia, can be categorized under dysmetropsia.  Macropsia is related to other conditions dealing with visual perception, such as aniseikonia and Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS, also known as Todd's syndrome).  Macropsia has a wide range of causes, from prescription and illicit drugs, to migraines and (rarely) complex partial epilepsy, and to different retinal conditions, such as epiretinal membrane.

41,"Well the last time I went there, all be it for less than a minute, and it didn't go full spectrum either, was about 5 months ago. It was late at night, I was tired and also hung over and the memory of it popped into my mind out of the blue and suddenly it was happening again. I got incredibly freaked out but actually managed to force myself out of it. Before that was about 5 years ago, again while trying to sleep and still fairly drunk from a night out. I felt it come over me, but managed to keep myself relatively calm and ride it out as I tried to fall asleep. The time before that was about 11 years ago on a train, which was another episode that lasted no more than a minute or two.

None of these were as intense as the kind of attacks I got in adolescence though. And at its peak I was having maybe 1 or 2 a week. So it still reappears sometimes, almost as if to remind me that it's something that can happen. Though it's incredibly rare these days.

I do very often get momentary blips though, as though it happens for one instant and then it's gone before I've even fully realised. Certain feelings and textures and scenes also trigger it a little bit and I have to quickly change my focus. That kind of stuff is sort of normal for me now though.

If it still happens I would definitely speak to a mental health professional about it. Full scale hallucination can be indicative of some pretty serious conditions.

Though again, if it were simply the particularly overactive imagination of a child and it was more that you were imagining them to be there rather than literally seeing corporeal manifestations, and it's not been a proper cause for concern of yours, then I would try not to worry too much about it.",Tiger_Widow,9di2x3

2,"A lot of people seem to think that the only reason people self harm is to feel something. At least, from what I‚Äôve seen. They think that we just want to feel something.

As much as that can be true, I don‚Äôt relate to it. I feel a lot of things. 

I self harm because I am overstimulated. I am feeling too many emotions at once. I am overwhelmed and I need to center on one thing. My brain will be going at a mile a minute and I need to slow it down. It calms me down usually. It literally feels like my emotions are under my skin and my cutting it open, it lets them out. It immediately calms me and leaves me feeling hollow and tired, but not pent up and absolutely losing it. 

I think it might be the difference between cutting from anxiety/ADHD and cutting from depression. Depression‚Äôs more likely to leave you feeling emotionless. I just feel too much. 

Side note, something else you may like want to remember for your project is that not all self harm is cutting. I cut myself with a knife but there are other things I and other people do that are not widely known about. It‚Äôs mostly because they don‚Äôt fit into the romanticized idea of cutting. (A beautiful girl with a razor to her wrist and running mascara.) A lot of things still qualify as self harm. They‚Äôre just as serious as cutting but are often thought of as lesser. Personally I sometimes bang my head against the wall. I also constantly pick at my skin. Mostly at acne, but I also pick at scabs or really anything I can get my nails into. I‚Äôve left huge craters in my skin from this. These are both forms of self harm. Other forms I‚Äôve heard of people doing: Burning, poking oneself with needles, and scratching or biting oneself.

For me it's a lack of an ability to deal with emotions. Sometimes I'm really mad at myself, angry, frustrated. I don't really like my personality and I tend to blame myself for my mistakes. 
Sometimes these thoughts concentrate, it's too much of them at once and I release stress by hitting myself. I unload stress, plus I have a sense of ""justice"", because I punish myself for my actions. At the time when my head buzzes with hatred, it's difficult to stay calm, and I feel I strong need to make it stop.
After I feel pain and stress out, I'm left with a feeling of calm, like the moment after the storm. It's quiet in my brain.

So any sources of powerful damage will overpower any emotional pain. A sharp cut produces a powerful and instant amount of pain. The brain will instinctually focus all attention on that source of damage.

That's why people with mental health issues sometimes cut themselves. Because their to the point where the emotional pain can't be endured any longer. So they inflicted damage on themselves to have a brake from the real pain.",bloomer62,d7gg8o

It's good you know that you have things that you can be thankful for, but to say that there's nothing that should be bothering you is a fundamentally incorrect way of going about mental issues. What you should be worried about is how to manage the issues - even if those issues include the fact that you're seemingly getting panic attacks for no reason. 


Medication is definitely an option - it's a good way to manage your hormones. But it's good to keep in mind that it's easy to go overboard. Sometimes you can lose yourself to them.


Mindset wise, it's very helpful to think towards the future. It's hard for some people to grasp it, but the fact of the matter is that life should always be lived in the present and future; you're never going to be able to get the time you've spent (whether good or bad) back. Life is meant to be spent with purpose. If you want to do something, then grab onto that and take it as far as your ambition allows you to. 


That being said, try to think logically. Turning to alcohol or smoking is not a good way to manage your emotions. It's beneficial only in the short term, and almost always makes things worse. Also, suicide should not be a way out. The world (as well as other people), while very shitty at times, has much more good to offer than what you've experienced thus far.

I hope you find comfort in these words. 
I cannot honestly imagine what you are going through.  It's terrifying when all these things just show up randomly at once, and extremely overwhelming. I really do understand and i'm sending you full love and support and i'll sincerely be praying with you. So please take time to yourself and reach out to loved one, reach out to calming and Comforting company, whether it is someone, and be sure that many many people care about you because i am sure you're a great person and i know for sure that you have to have impacted someone's life positively at some point (whoever showed up in your mighg right now must be a great example i guess) , or a pet, and i'm sure animals can sense pain and will try to help. Lastly, i am asking that you do not act on anything that your brain tells you before thinking ' is this a good idea ' if the answer is yes, do proceed, if it's no reach out for someone as soon as possible and please please please do not think about giving up and keep looking for joy in the little things. 'Little things matter, little things make life a happier place '. 
Stay safe, please be okay.
Much love, support and prayers. 
And to anyone who might be struggling, you are not alone, i feel your pain, we're all fighting for a better life and we will do our best to not give up and win our fight,  and do not be scared or worried or ashamed of seeking help, you already are great for surviving this long.

0,"A psychosis can vary greatly from person to person. But in most cases I know of, after a few weeks when medicamentation kicks in, those symptoms like delusions go away completely. My mother for instance had 3 psychosis already, and she returned back to normal every time. Also I had a psychosis myself, and returned back to normal after two weeks of being institutionalised. Usually it takes a little bit longer though, but after a month or so, the meds should kick in.

A personality disorder would be something that doesn't just suddenly appear, with your wife it looks really much more like a psychosis as far as I can tell.
My mother also always hated my father when she was psychotic, where I on the other hand would just fall in love girls I barely knew. My point is, this illness fucks not only with your thoughts and behaviour but also with your feelings.
Also the fact that she was depressed before this is typical for a psychosis, and was also the case with me.
So from my experience, and I was very far away, convinced of being god or jesus or something and even wilder things, being a rambling madmen, it is very much possible that your wife returns back to normal rather quick, it's just that the medicamentation always needs about a month to do it's trick.

I can also recommend you schizophrenia.com where you will also find a forum especially for family members or husbands like you, where you can ask all your questions and will find support from people who go trough the same thing.

But in my experience, things can turn out pretty well, but me and my mother both work together with psychiatrists and take our medicamentation regulary, that's a big thing when fighting with this illness, and not everyone with this problem I know does that. 

After she gets released from the hospital she probably has to take medicamentation for a few years, but if she does that, she will most probably be able to lead a pretty normal life. ",kloti,u5c6e
1,"Speaking from personal experience, antipsychotics can help quite a bit. I had false resentment, impatience, and paranoia towards some of my family by the time I was put in the mental hospital but by the time I got out I was much better.

2,"UPDATE:
She was released two weeks ago, after a three week stay.  MDs had a tough time getting her symptoms under control.  Our life and marriage is wrecked, we both want out.  I am trying my hardest to help her land on her feet, but she resents me so much for having a hand in getting her forced help that she's unwilling to work with me.  She was still very sick when she was released, but the big delusional stuff has subsided.  Recovery is a long road, and she does not want my help.  ",TreyIsAJedi,u5c6e

1,"My brother is actually quite similar I know it's not him though it's the years of laziness, substance abuse, and parents doing anything for him. Honestly, I don't hate him at all I feel bad for him because I know what he could be. But I don't think you are an asshole family or not if does those things I wouldn't feel sympathy",Otherwise-Pen-6509,q3orv1
2,"I don't blame you, but I do think you have to ask yourself, why you don't want to be responsible for him, exactly?  


Is it because you fear he will hurt your life? Your immediate family's life? Do you feel he is dangerous? I'm not saying that, because I think you're an asshole, but I think you haven't been clear why you don't want to. Is this about being uncomfortable or is this about someone  really ruining your life?????? Is this about a resentment of a person you struggle to understand or is this about resentment of yourself not being a better person that you feel you should be? Are you really mad him...or yourself for leaving????  


I also think you have to ask yourself about what your parents want/expect from you and if they respect/accept you for not wanting too? That is, if you care about them (which you seem to, or you wouldn't resent your brother for what you feel he has done to them).  


I understand resenting someone who doesn't let you exist or let you try to live a better life, but if he has something or has experienced something that isn't entirely his fault (and you know this), then it's not really fair to blame ""him"" for something he can't control or others haven't been able to better help him manage; and if you're in a position where you have outlets/friends, and are financially stable, then really how much do you think he can take away from you, if he is the one that doesn't have those things???  


The only thing I will say is that there could be a missed opportunity here for both of you to grow, because you may be able to help him better than your parents did and/or set different boundaries to change the dynamic which could also be beneficial to him/you.  


I don't think it's your responsibility per say, unless your parents really expected it from you, but there is a reason you wanted to call attention to it. You are bothered by it or are looking for validation to make a decision one way or another.  


But please note, I'm no expert, I'm just giving my opinion based on what I am presuming to know based on what you wrote.",TheOtherMe4,q3orv1
3,"I say I hate him but I do love him kind of. I love who he was. I love that he is funny and charming and cares about animals‚Äî- but it doesn‚Äôt matter when all he ever does is yell at me about all the pain he‚Äôs in ( absolutely pain somatization)  and that he doesn‚Äôt have a job or children.  And that I don‚Äôt understand and that he should just kill himself.   The best is when he calls my parents, in their 70s, at 2 am complaining that his teeth hurt and then tells me he was lonely so what else was he supposed to do?  He‚Äôs awful.

4,"What do you envision happening when your parents are gone? That‚Äôs part of our crisis. He relies on them completely.  I will not take that on. Not even a little. I feel like as they get older and he realizes they will be gone more of a borderline personality disorder is being revealed. At least his behavior is exactly like that. Do you think you would resent him more if he started to characterize you as ‚Äú you are all I‚Äôve got!‚Äù I just want to scream‚Äî ‚ÄúI was never there. I left 35 years ago. As soon as I could to get away from the dynamic.   ‚Äú. Am I responsible for him even though I did everything to get away?  I‚Äôve never in my life asked him for anything. How can he demand that I become responsible for him? ‚Äú can you call me more often so I can complain about how awful everything is and tell you life is unfair because you are the polar opposite.‚Äù No, I can‚Äôt. But I feel like such a jerk.",Errr789,q3orv1

6,"I think a major problem is his intrusiveness, and that my parents expect me to have as few boundaries with him as they do.  He calls them in the middle of the night to complain. They will tell him he shouldn‚Äôt do that to me  because I have a job and kids ( he has done this.) I say - wait‚Äî- even if I weren‚Äôt working with no kids it‚Äôs NOT ok to call me in the middle of the night to complain.  I‚Äôm not mad at myself for leaving, but i am that I don‚Äôt want him to re-enter my life.  It‚Äôs even crap like there has been a history of accusations ( twice) from women‚Äî not sexual assault but more like showing up repeatedly when he‚Äôs been told to go away.  My mom‚Äôs take was that they were ‚Äú manipulative bad women.‚Äù  Mine is WTF?  We make excuses for creepy behavior? 

He has financial stability from our parents, has vacations with them paid for, college degree paid for,  cash psychiatric payments, car paid for, is on disability, and they established a trust fund for him and bought him a house.  My parents never earned more than 90k between the two of them but made smart investments after 1995.  They had no money when I went to college so I got financial aid and loans and then paid for my doctorate completely with loans. And now they want to move down here with him, and Part of it is to force him into my life.  They want to see me and the kids, but I know part of it is for me to take over for them with him.  They are pissed when I say he can‚Äôt just show up at my house. I just want him to stay away from me.   I know of nothing traumatic that has ever happened to him. I think my parents are at a loss to deal with his manipulation.  And I can‚Äôt listen to his complaints that his life is awful and our parent‚Äôs don‚Äôt want to pay for experimental medical treatments for 10,000 etc.  oh, and he complains that I‚Äôm ‚Äú going to be just like mom.‚Äù  Yeah, no. I would never tolerate you‚Ä¶  

I spend most of my day with scared people who have often received or are afraid of receiving terrible news.  It‚Äôs hard to listen to his complaints, and watch my parents break themselves over him. 

I‚Äôm sure that you are right that there is a lot of potential growth but I just don‚Äôt want any growth if it means spending time with him. He got my parents. I gave enough.",Errr789,q3orv1
7,"Ok, well I'm not sure is there much more to say, because your last paragraph seems to conclude how you feel and seems to imply you have already made a decision.  


It's really not fair to bait people into a conversation just so you can validate your reasons, without really considering why you have these feelings/where they are really coming from. I'm not saying I don't appreciate you explaining, but you are doing it from a pretty bias place. And I don't think you can go deeper until you let go of some of your animosity, which don't get me wrong, I KNOW is not easy to do---but you are the one that is hurting or you wouldn't be here writing about it.  


It's your right if you don't want someone in your life---but it sounds like you will be hurting your parents too, since they are the ones that want to move themselves/your brother closer to you and that  might be what this is really about: hurting your parents.",TheOtherMe4,q3orv1

1,"Wow this is a lot of different resources! It was a bit overwhelming and a slap in the face to read, so I advice others to see it like you should only take in what suits you. For example meditation is a no go for me. It only opened flashbacks and retraumatized me. (It's not recommended to do without supervision for a reason) Same with weed /, cannabis etc, opens my flashbacks and retraumatize me.

However reading books like Peter Levin's books,
And help apps / work sheets, regular exercise, cool showers, acupuncture / self massage works very well for me, as well as trauma focused yoga (There's specific yoga  for that if you search on YouTube)

I'm curious how the EMDR app works? And how much it costs? I don't afford expensive apps but it depends how much they help. I found EMDR therapy to work extremely well on me but for economical reasons I only had a few sessions. 


Art therapy was also great for me. And I have noticed that it's my type of meditation now at home, to colour, draw, paint. It makes me grounded and safe. 
There's colour apps, there's colour books. I have both. I also have painting material online and irl so when I need to do art, it's all easy accessed. 

There's a physical boundary practice I learned once that also helps me. Where you lay on the floor /couch /bed and do a movement with an arm or a leg and then you say stop and stop the movement. You can do this on pairs too where someone moves your arm or leg and then you say stop and they stop. 

If someone likes animals I seriously reccommend finding a way to interact with animals as often as possible. I follow all animal subs. They crowd my feed and make me warm safe and smiling. I take care of dogs I visit people with animals as often I can. Heck I even go outside my apartment building just to see if a neighbor cat is outside.  They tend to hang around the neighborhood and I give them my pets and love! 


In terms of help online. The best mental app I have ever come across is ""Youper"" I used it while it was for free for 3 years and wow it helped me more than ever. It costs now since they've updated it, if you afford it I couldn't reccommend any mental health app more. I consider paying to stay on there. That's how good it is. You should check out the trailer on youtube to get an idea of why I love it so much.",Queen-of-meme,wuqxle

3,"Thank you for taking the time to read this and it is true that not everything on this list is going to work well for everyone, this post is just a toolbox and people can pick what works for them. 

The EMDR apps that I listed are for free, or they were last I checked. I use the phone app for cold baths combined with breathwork sometimes and this combo has helped. The desktop app I listed has a number of settings to adjust the EMDR experience. There isn't guided therapy/meditations that come with these apps but combining them with EMDR self therapy resources could be an option. 

I have done a few physical boundary exercises as well, I've not heard of Youper though, I will look into this. 

You are right about meditation, it does pose those risks for some people, as does mindfulness ironically. Mindfulness can be a double edge sword, Trauma-Sensitive Mindfulness is a book that discusses this: 

[https://www.amazon.com/Trauma-Sensitive-Mindfulness-Practices-Transformative-Healing/dp/0393709787](https://www.amazon.com/Trauma-Sensitive-Mindfulness-Practices-Transformative-Healing/dp/0393709787)

1,"Hi. You can doubt your therapist diagnosis if that doesn‚Äôt feel right. Ask them more information, and share your doubts, ask them why they thought about ocd instead of gad. I‚Äôm not a professional but maybe it‚Äôs a bit of both, maybe it‚Äôs none of them. 
From what you wrote i too thought about ocd (but again I am NOT a therapist, i just read stuff). Idk just try to comunicate your doubts, and hopefully they will get solved.

For panic attacks, what I found helpful in my personal experience, is to drink (I‚Äôm forced to stop breathing in order to drink) and cold things (grounding) like holding ice. Sometimes I start describing stuff out loud, like what it‚Äôs my room, or how does the plushie at the end of my bed look like, in details; it helps to distract me.

1,"I have similar circumstances. I too am experiencing something similar to your situation. I just wanted to drop a note to say ‚Äúyou are not alone in this.‚Äù My circumstances are a result of a chronic physical condition as well. 

I recently started to set goals for myself the night before each day.  It‚Äôs challenging when you have lack of motivation, however it gives me a map of something good/beneficial for the next day without having to spend mental energy on it then.

I have also started taking a cold shower for 10 min right when I wake up. No pc, no phone, and no electronics for the first 2 hours of my day. I use at least 30min of that to meditate.

I‚Äôve only been doing these things for about 2 months and have started to have a better outlook.

Another thing you might try is reach out in your community and look for cool activities to do outside in your area. I used to be big into stargazing and found some really good spots for this by just asking. Again it‚Äôs tough to get going but once I‚Äôm there under the open sky I find I enjoy it.

It sounds terrible",Accomplished_Run_825,pvkezq
2,"1-2.1, unfortunately that isn‚Äôt abnormal in my experience. I would never have been able to navigate the system of trauma treatment while actively suffering that intensely, it‚Äôs been years of one on one psychology that got me to a point I‚Äôm resilient enough to deal with the incompetent and harsh staff. I‚Äôve been accidentally billed $300+ out of the blue and had to fight the charges, I was running 1 minute behind for group and told by staff to not bother coming in. I had to jump in an Uber and run in a panic and then the group didn‚Äôt start until 5 minutes after I got there anyway. The long invasive question sessions with no aftercare are common, and the DBT group was so frustrating and patronising to me I felt I was being gaslit, I was learning nothing and as it‚Äôs about learning to control your moods and judgements it was a cycle of I feel this is so ridiculous and unhelpful but maybe that just means I‚Äôm REALLY ill - but it wasn‚Äôt me it was the therapy. I moved to schema therapy at the same place and it‚Äôs much better, but I was waiting without support for months. I‚Äôm not sure which country you‚Äôre in but yeah, very difficult. In terms of 5. though I was pushed on to seroquel and had a really bad reaction by a shitty psychiatrist who then told me to only take it if I ‚Äúreally need it‚Äù - I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable under her care when I needed to go into inpatient because of this, I was scared I‚Äôd be sedated by her and she was against my use of CBD oil. 
My current psychiatrist was so alarmed when he heard and told me my reaction sounded like serotonin syndrome or something else deadly. 

So in my experience psychiatrists pushing sedation is worth leaving, but shitty staff and triggering procedure is pretty standard and I was only able to navigate it when really ill with the help of a carer. Hope that helps.

I know a lot of people don‚Äôt have the luxury of a carer to help when things get difficult but if you do I highly recommend turning to them whenever you‚Äôre dealing with staff, you‚Äôre there to get help and shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with the staff nonsense and that might be the only way to get through it in early stages of treatment until you build more resilience.",smartie-,pvkezq

1,"Great resources and information. Thanks for sharing.

I took a peak at your book recommendations and I agree, your C-PTSD books are spot on; I‚Äôve read all of them myself and I highly recommend them also.

You mention having executive dysfunction/ADHD and mentioned Gabor Mat√©‚Äôs book: ‚ÄúScattered Minds‚Äù but you‚Äôve never read it yourself. It‚Äôs one of the best books I‚Äôve read on ADHD and I don‚Äôt recall him ever saying ADHD doesn‚Äôt exist. If it didn‚Äôt exist, he wouldn‚Äôt have written the book. He also states many times that he has a diagnoses of ADHD, as does all 3 of his children. 
If you liked his other book: ‚ÄúWhen the body says no‚Äù, you will likely really like this one. I don‚Äôt very often read books twice, but this one I plan to. 

Like yourself, I have spent years in personal development, recovery and therapy, and you‚Äôre right, there are definitely a ton of resources.  
Based on the books you‚Äôve already read and recommended, you might really like: ‚ÄúLove Warrior‚Äù by Glennon Doyle Melton.
Another book is: Healing the shame that binds you. It‚Äôs a bit old school but I did find some of it very eye opening and based on your c-ptsd books, you‚Äôd probably find it really helpful also. 

I noticed we also follow the holistic psychologist. She‚Äôs great. Can‚Äôt wait to read her new book. 

Some of your recommendations are already on my list of books to read (Radical acceptance); I love your taste in books :)

Scattered Minds is actually the first book I read by Gabor Mate. He doesn't say it doesn't exist, but that it byproduct of attachment issues, basically. 

I'll look into the books you mentioned and I definitely have high hopes for the Holistic Psycholgist's book. I hope it will be that one guide to the healing path.

4,"Thanks for commenting! I wrote this instead of working, so it's good to hear that someone actually got value out of it.",maafna,kmc192
5,"Would love to follow you!

I‚Äôve said for years that ADHD is definitely a trauma response and everything that Mate said about it in relation to attachment lined up with how it is for me. 

One of the interesting parts about it was, before I read his book, a couple weeks before that, I came to the realization (through my therapist) that I was avoiding being present. Because when I‚Äôm present, I would feel my authenticity, and when there‚Äôs the limiting belief about the negative ways I feel about myself, of course I don‚Äôt want to be present. 
It was really eye opening for me because that realization connected all the dots to why I‚Äôm the way I am and why I‚Äôve made the decisions in life that I‚Äôve made. It‚Äôs like the limiting belief created a fork in the road and I went the other way. And when you have confirmation bias, looking to affirm this limiting belief, every time I‚Äôm at a fork in the road where that limiting belief comes up, I take the other road... so when I realized this, it‚Äôs like I realized all of these things are connected; by this road that goes right back to when the limiting belief started. And it all goes back to attachment for me. 

I checked out some of your other posts in your profile and we have a lot in common and you‚Äôve come a long ways. If you ever want to chat more in depth about your journey of healing, I‚Äôm down. Could be very insightful. Or we could just chat about the books we are reading, because we like the same books :)",Suspicious-Carpet157,kmc192
6,"My ADHD is definitely tied to my inability to be present. I am always in my thoughts. Trying to meditate stresses me out even more.

I'm feeling low because I feel that no matter how much progress I make, maybe I'm still a bundle of trauma responses and will always be? I'm trying to learn to be present but I am also extremely resistant to it.

1,"I can tell you some self-help things but I'm not saying necessarily that these are all you need. Treating a serious case of depression with nothing but self-help is risky.  
  
Taking things in baby steps - very important. This is the key to motivation and motivation is the key to recovery.  
  
Just 20 min of brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much.  
  
This is a motivation trick that's been used in behavior modification programs since the 1930s. If a task seems like it's too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time, and start with something really, really easy.   
  
You can even use the baby steps principle for having fun. If you're not getting any enjoyment out of things, here's something that people here have said is helpful with that problem. Look all over and do a complete inventory. You should be able to find at least one or two things you like, such as your favorite music or movie. If there's just one movie you like, watch it once or twice. Then, find movies that are like it in some way - with similar story or the same actor. Keep adding to your entertainment supply to give it variety.  
  
If you're thinking about professional help, treatment usually begins by seeing the GP, who can give you a referral. I mention referral because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you'd want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day, any symptoms you might have such as change in appetite or sleep, and things in your life affecting how you feel.  
  
If you're depressed, I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.  
  
Video, below - details about self-help based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression - nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise, and social support, also traditional Asian methods.

2,"It could be depression, and it might also be a mild panic attack that you‚Äôre experiencing. The constricted feeling coupled with the inability to even force yourself to do what you want is the clue there. 

So, try this: set a schedule for the next day of what you want to do and a time. Make it just 20 minutes of the activity. 

Write it down by hand and put the paper where you can see it when you wake up. 

When you go to sleep, envision yourself doing the task and make the positive feelings come. Tell yourself out loud how much you‚Äôre looking forward to the 20 minute activity. 

Then go to sleep. 

When you wake up, tell yourself how excited you are to be doing the activity at 2:00 or whenever it is. 

When the time comes, set a timer and work for the time allotted. If the constrained feeling comes, simply acknowledging it and breathing through it until the timer goes off. 

If you can‚Äôt work, don‚Äôt fret or worry, just sit there and remember the last time you did this and enjoyed it so much. **this counts as the work!**

At the end of 20 minutes, stop **even if you‚Äôre enjoying yourself!! Even if you‚Äôre really into it!!**

Congratulate yourself on doing what you did and reminding yourself you can do more later. Then get yourself a cookie or something yummy (seriously). 

Then don‚Äôt do any more of that work until the next day. 

Follow this plan daily and you‚Äôll be building trust in yourself and begin to overwrite the wiring that‚Äôs somehow short circuiting your plans. 

Every small step helps move you forward.",TuTuMuch,vtjmlm

0,"On the whole, I agree with what you're saying. My pain and dysfunction has been handed down to me through generations of denied and miscommunicated emotions. 
I was today old when I realized that what I thought was happiness was actually just stress. As a child, in stressful situations, I was told how exciting things were and wasn't this fun? I was told I should be enjoying this experience but I was never informed that the feeling I was actually experiencing was stress. So I spent my whole life chasing down things that made me stressed and uncomfortable. I didn't focus on the things that made me calm and happy because I had learned that what I was doing was being complacent and that I had to be doing things that I disliked to be happy.

Having spent most of my life with all my feelings invalidated from multiple sources, yeah I got depression and anxiety. It has taken me a long time to build the stability I've needed to feel safe; the validation I've needed to feel loved; and find the life that I've actually always wanted but was told that I didn't because it's not conventionally ""right"". I believed that I could not be happy because the things that I was told would make me happy did not. I believed I could not be happy because I had learned all the wrong names for emotions. 

All the advice I got that was supposed to ""put me ahead"" in life has actually just put me behind. There's no shortcut or secret formula to happiness because not everyone's happiness is the same. Each person has to learn for themselves what that is to them.",ForsakenDragonfly8,brqn55
1,"Beautifully stated, and a wonderful insight. There is no way for others to determine or dictate what will make you happy or whole. I think the best any of us can do is go after those things that are in alignment with how we want to feel. There may be very few sign posts for this but with time, and attention to detail with regard to self, I feel wholeness is achievable.

One piece of advice I‚Äôve received time and time again is that if something makes you feel uncertain or unsure, then you owe it to yourself to investigate it. On the margin, engaging with life, and limiting restriction itself, may very well be the road to happiness. 

Thank you again for sharing such a wonderful thought from experience. I‚Äôm sure anyone who reads it will find it resonates with them.",MichaelOlan,brqn55
0,"Well, you are definitely not alone. I was starting to think you sounded like me in a way, only my mother was an addict who died when I was 8 and had 6 kids she could never care for. Was a kind soul though. 
The only friend I have in my small town, had the same feelings towards her mother. Let's call this girl Joan, and her mother Cecile. Cecile's delusions were drug induced but would wake Joan up through her teenage years with notions of insects crawling on her and people watching her. Joan was sick sick SICK of it. She had a baby (same time as me) and told Cecile she was too tired for her to visit her only granddaughter, Joan was always angry with her behaviour, her choices. Cecile died from those said choices about a year ago. Joan feels remorse that her mother never got to meet the baby, but... It is the past. 
I understand where you're coming from. I've never been in the same situation, but I've witnessed it first hand. I've been in personal relationships with the same sort of circumstances. 
Your home is your safe place, that's where you go to be you. I know from myself that whenever I was in a situation where I couldn't grow as a person anymore, or felt as though I wasn't appreciated or respected, I knew I had to leave. I had to get through the discomfort and fear of change and just, do it... Start something, anything for myself. I'm 23 and female as well. I've lived with 3 people across the country of Canada. The first 2 I had to leave due to unfair and painful circumstances. 
Everyone deserves to have a place where they feel safe, respected, out of the line of criticism. Your mother may not understand that the things she says to you and the way she acts is offensive and embarrassing. If it's what a person has grown to know, how can they know anything different?
Maybe talking about it with her, under the wing of a specialist, a therapist, a person who sees it from an outside, professional view, could put new things into perspective?",carnalapathy,5d9uyy

4,"This heavily depends on where you live, the setting they work in and the disorder/population they specialize in. 

Where I live, almost all psychiatrists in private practice also have a postgraduate in psychotherapy and do offer therapy. The ones in private practice who aren't psychotherapists, usually are either neuropsychiatrists (in title or de facto) or forensic psychiatrists who specialize in providing expert assessments for courts or insurances. 

It's different for psychiatrists in general or psychiatric hospitals/ treatment centres, though. Many psychiatrists on psychiatric wards in general hospitals don't offer therapy. Which is logical because the purpose of those wards is to stabilise the patients and refer them to further treatment if necessary, and because they also often deal with somatic illnesses on the ward (when they are family doctor level, like putting in stitches, diagnosing a flue,...). Psychiatrists on dementia wards or other wards with a heavy somatic component, like ECT, psychotic disorders, etc. also don't tend to offer therapy. They are already preoccupied with the many, many somatic symptoms, side effects, interactions and have therapists and psychologists on staff who can do therapy.

This is so called insight type of therapy, therapist could be challenging you or record the session (sound and picture) and this is not for me. I also would be affraid that since it is very time restricted I will get attached to therapist and the therapy would be over before the attachement would be resolved. I think trauma therapy should be much gentle and is about safety (also in your body) and not insight. I know tons about myslef and it has not helped me to feel better. Obviously this is me and only my opinion but I would advice you to ask your therapist who they plan to help you, have they worked with ptsd before, how they make sure you are not retraumatising yourself, do they work somatically and could incorporate those Interventions so you can learn to rely on this and not meds?

0,"I have misophonia too, including movement triggers.

I know the severity of my symptoms is linked to how generally anxious I'm feeling. If I'm happy and healthy I can deal with mouth noises and such, but if I'm way stressed out I can't deal. Misophonia SUCKS, but if you are going to be in a relationship *bring it up to the forefront quickly*. If your partner can't deal, don't be their partner, find someone who can accomodate you. Be willing to accomodate their issues in return. 

With that in mind, I think focusing on relieving stress may mitigate your symptoms. Keep your base strong (nutrition/exercise/socialization/sleep/productivity) to keep your mind at its most capable. If you're socially anxious, learning to be more assertive may help, making you less stressed (expressing your needs will do that) and so more able to handle triggers. [Here's social anxiety resources.](http://www.socialanxietysupport.com/)

Exposure therapy seems to be the only way to get over it, and I'm not sure if there are therapists working with misophonia this way. But the method is pretty much - be around the trigger, relax as much as possible, try to accept it and let the sound happen and not tense up against it. Practice that over and over and over to rewire your brain to not have the awful response it once did. Mindfulness meditation can help your mind get better at directing attention and accepting reality. (I like the book The Mindful Geek for a secular approach)

God I wish misophonia sufferers had more help available, or wider acceptance, like in the workplace or classroom. Sometimes the only way to deal is to have earplugs/headphones. It's definitely a physical wiring issue in the brain, an arbitrary mistake and not something we learn over time.

There's a clue here, it could be related to early relational trauma and accumulated, adaptive responses. Any known trauma in your childhood or background? Are you in therapy? 

I did various kinds of therapy for years and found the most effective and permanently changing process has been one involving [somatic experiencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_Experiencing), and a [somatic psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_psychology) approach (in similar territory as /u/StegosaurusArtCritic's comments).
