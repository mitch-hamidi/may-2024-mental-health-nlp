2,Is it necessary to take medication on every episode?,"Hey, I was diagnosed around 1 year ago and there are a lot of things that my family does in my crisis moments that just feels like it's making things worse.
Like if idk something has triggered me so bad that I start crying or hyperventilating and my mum will force me to take strong medication to fall asleep for hours, but the way that she doesn't even help me, try to calm me or talk to me and just forces me to drug myself and threaten to send me to a hospital if i deny the medication just really makes me even more anxious.
I don't know if it's necessary to get to that point so soon instead of waiting and talking to me.
I really try to explain it to my mother so she can help me and we can understand it better but it just confuses me so much because I don't know any other bpd my age or even in my town and I really need some help understanding all of this, there are still a lot of things that I don't understand about myself or my condition but this is my main concern right now.
Do all BPD anxious episodes need to be managed through medication? Because it really gets me more anxious ...

3,advice/medication side effects,"hi,

i feel a little silly(?) if that’s the right word, maybe embarrassed but i just met with my local community mental health team assessor today for the first time. after 15 years of being messed about, let down etc she actually listened to me and said she doesn’t diagnose but she said i can tell this isn’t clinical depression and your symptoms seem to suggest EUPD(the word she used), and said she thinks the doctor is going to prescribe mood stabilisers, so i’m wondering what are the side effects like for any mood stabiliser? just to prepare myself. 

also, does anyone have any advice on how to come with finally getting that diagnosis? just to add, i’ve had many GPs suggest i probably have BPD but they never actually referred me on to get this support/actual diagnosis 

thank you and i appreciate any advice/comments

4,Interesting interaction with medical professional - UK NHS,"
I was in seeing a mental health professional today. 

I've tried cbt several times and I've never ""completed"" it some of the times there were internal errors, some times I moved out of the area and sometimes I was the issue and found cbt so harmful to myself I had to stop for the good of my health. 

I have been asking for dbt for years now but because I'm ""not in an active crisis"" they won't refer me to it. I was seeking help yet again today and the medical professional likened the fact I haven't ""completed"" cbt to ""not completing a dose of antibiotics"" and that leaving the ""dose unfinished means it can never help, so we don't actually know if cbt doesn't help"" they said this was ""tough love"" and  referred me bakc to a psychologist which I'm grateful for, however I'm worried I'm just going to be given cbt again and not have my worries listened to.
Does anyone have any insight or similar experiences with this? I'm in the UK specifically going through NHS Scotland. 

I'm trying to get better so I don't fuck up yet another relationship after stumbling across the nicest and most understanding human. He doesn't deserve the bs bpd can bring and I've done my best healing and understanding my bpd on my own but I struggle still with abandonment.

5,How to cope with separation from fp and the sudden stop from taking medication (very venty but mainly seeking advice or support,"Posting on a throwaway bc paranoia 

Me (M19) and my Fp (M20) have been in a serious romantic relationship for quite a while, we both have bpd and he’s being evaluated for possible schizophrenia, we’ve both been open about our mental health and since the beginning, we’ve been open about our mutual fps on each other and due to it, our separation anxiety. Due to recent events which I won’t go into specifics to in attempts to keep this post as short as possible, my Fp was sent to the psychward for about a week or so, he had to give up his phone just about two hours ago and I’ve been at a total loss, I don’t know what to do with myself and I can’t stop crying, I don’t know how he is, how he’s doing, what he’s doing, nothing. We are long distance due to college starting in a few months so I cannot visit him, he wrote down my number before they drove him to facility so he wouldn’t forget it but it’s likely they won’t let him call me anytime soon. I’m in contact with his mom but our conversations have been limited and I am at a total loss.

I’ve tried distracting myself but there’s nothing i can do, i have no friends to rely on, I have no enjoyment for anything anymore, watching videos and playing games leave me with nothing, I feel a sense of emptiness so deep that it’s crippling, I don’t know what to do. He’s my support system, he’s my everything and without him I have nothing and I am nothing, I have awful thoughts and memories that I try to fend away but i cannot, nothing helps and I’m hurting. I am an artist, I have art I owe that I must work on but I can’t get myself to do anything, my hands are hurting, I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I can’t think or I think too much, I still can’t tell.

The worst part of it all is that I was forced to stop taking my medication suddenly after taking it consistently everyday since April. For some context, i started having an allergic reaction yesterday, mainly just hives, I still don’t know what from, today the hives were still here even after I spent the day yesterday taking allergy relief and lathering myself up In anti itch shit that really didn’t help much. I went to the doctor today once they started to swell, initially I suspected my medication because I didn’t eat or do anything out of the ordinary (i don’t go outside) but after being seen by the doctor and had blood taken, he ruled it out and I fainted, had a panic attack, had some stuff injected in me and all that good shit. I called my psychiatrist right afterwards for good measure and she was unable to speak with me since she was with another patient but her receptionist contacted me after speaking with her and I was informed to stop taking my medication all together until we could speak. 

My next appointment was meant to be June 3rd but I am considering calling in tomorrow and arranging a sooner appointment or something because I feel like I’m losing my goddamn mind(

I just feel like I have no direction right now and I miss him so badly im hurting physically and I don’t know when illl be able to finally hear from him again, I only have him, I have no one else, if he’s gone, im done for.

7,Self-medication,"I'm doing pretty well on the whole with managing my emotions, not acting out, etc, etc.  Except for my one dark little secret:  I smoke rather a lot of weed.

I'm not advocating for using any type of drugs or alcohol.  I know all the reasons we aren't supposed to do it.  

I don't use it to control my emotions, though.  I use to to manage my *thoughts*.  I feel like there are many little versions of me in my head at any given time.  I know this is fairly normal.  But they're all chattering, chattering, chattering all at once.  And they like to throw things at me like reminding me of the existence of people and things I'd rather forget.

This is an analogy, by the way, I'm not completely whacko.  I know all those ""voices"" are me.  I just feel so helpless to them sometimes.

And when I smoke weed, most of them quiet down.  Especially the ones that fly in and tell me things like ""your ex was right to treat you like shit"" and ""no one really loves you and no one ever will.""  They shut up.  All that's left is the louder ""voices"" that I actually feel in control of.

11,"Medication withdrawal - feeling the urge to self harm for the first time in years, any tips on getting through that aren't straight up denial?","So like a week ago I stopped taking Zoloft 150mg. It was making me feel incredibly empty, detached, and not like myself... like I guess it helped me get through depressive episodes and emotional pain but the way it did that was really unpleasant, I felt like an imposter in my own life? Idk. Like I couldn't cry about something for longer than a few seconds because the emotions would just dissipate. I also couldn't find joy for long either tho because I felt so flat. 

Anyway! The full force of my emotions is hitting me again, and I feel like I've lost all of the progress I made pre-Zoloft. Back to feeling like a gaping wound. Everything is making me cry and mentally hate myself. So far I've tried pushing the negative thoughts/feelings to the side and faking feeling okay but that is not working and is lowkey driving me crazy. Not to mention dealing with pregnancy hormones on top of it. I feel like I'm just waiting for my husband to yell at me or kick me out or leave me for someone else.

The urge to cut/stab/punch myself is really really strong and hard to resist. And honestly in my right mind I'd know how to deal but I'm feeling so worthless, like I need someone else to tell me what I should do bcuz ""I"" won't listen to myself... idk if that makes sense.

12,I’ve Been So Much Happier Lately,"I’ve spent most of my life coping and making poor decisions for myself. I’ve spent so many years wanting to, ya know, end my suffering. 

I was diagnosed with BPD/OCD 2 years ago. I was devastated with the BPD diagnosis due to the low chances of being able to get help. Therapists are hard for us to find. Some of us are medication resistant. Truly, I’ve never had a medication or therapist that could help me. 

Then I met my current psychiatrist. After meeting me a few times she asked me if I had ever also considered an ADHD diagnosis on top of the OCD/BPD. I told her I had thought about it considering my son, my mother, and my youngest sister have been diagnosed with ADHD. She evaluated me. And low 
and behold, we added that to the list of things “wrong” with me. 

So, she started me on medication. Life changing is an understatement. I know my symptoms are unique to others due to the multiple complex disorders I have. So, this will not be everyone’s experience. But the medication has not just alleviated adhd specific symptoms, but my BPD/OCD symptoms have greatly subsided. I don’t wake up every day wishing I didn’t. 

My impulse control is better. I’m a happier, more attentive mother and partner. I handle my stressful life situations better without my brain automatically going straight to “must die.” 

Guys, I don’t really have many people to talk to that would understand what a relief this has been. I know you guys live with the constant pain and recklessness so you understand what a dark, hopeless mindset we tend to stay in. 

Today, the weather is beautiful. I’m feeling good inside my body. I feel beautiful again. I feel human. I appreciate the oxygen in the air and the blue of the sky. I applied my self tan. I’m shopping for Easter baskets for the kids (not Christian, just for fun). I’m finishing projects. I’m moving up at work. I have debt and bills and serious life stress and trauma. But I’m grateful for the moment. 

I hope everyone here can find a way to feel peace. I’m sending everyone vibes of healing and abundance and peace. If you read this far, thank you for allowing me to safely post my moment of brightness in my life. Ive never felt pure happiness before now. I’m grateful for this.

23,how do i stop these constant intrusive thought cycles ?,"I am 23 years old and have been diagnosed with BPD from a very young age, which i always found odd because such diagnoses are not usually given out that early. Besides the point after lots of therapy and lots of different medication I decided medication was not for me and using my skills/ maturing and growing would supplement. I absolutely hate the way medication makes me feel and I was very open to trying tons of different options from tons of different psychiatrists. Throughout all this time it’s just been years and years of absolute insanity I went through serious verbal emotional and sometimes physical abuse from my father when I was little developed a self harm and literal heroin addiction which after years and years I was able to knock. I was in a horrid relationship with a 30 year old grown man with BPD when i was 19 that was horrid but i was petrified to lose my cats ( which he ended up stealing anyways) But I finally mustard up the courage to leave. After that I really started diving into my healing, setting boundaries staying active and with purpose doing hobbies instead of going out to the bars so much. It was all starting to clear up for me and I was no longer a sad shell of a person with constant insane thoughts controlling my brain and perception. I have now began a new relationship with another undiagnosed man w BPD ( his family is holistic but his mother and sister have told me it runs in family and he definitely has it) way closer to my age range actually enjoys the things I enjoy I love him so much and it’s truly been so fun and showed me what I deserve in a partnership! BUT he has never seen any medication or therapy and has severe episodes that do always include extreme verbal abuse and sometimes extreme physical abuse. Because of these episodes I have started having mine again, which makes me uneasy as it has been a long longggg time since i’ve had a violent raging self harming BPD episode and it scares me and makes me feel gross about my self. So with all that context this morning we had a very big discussion about how his episodes are causing me to digress and im feeling more and more mentally i’ll every day. He has agreed to make changes and be a more active communicator. But i just have this sinking feeling that no matter how it goes all the hurt has piled up too much and my brain won’t let me forget all the lies and hurtful words and abuse.

25,How to tell between splitting/senseless anger vs anger that makes total sense?,"Idk if I'm wording this right, English isn't my first language so bear with me.

So for context, me and my partner are both diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder, so we have a hard time admitting our faults when we fight, or just being patient with each other. We both have abusive traits in the relationship and I'm not proud of that.

But I got ZERO mental health knowledge, so I don't really know how to tell when I'm wrong for screaming, contradicting, ignoring, being angry at my partner and when I'm right for doing so (as in: he did something that will spite an angry response in ANYONE). 

Yesterday, his sister brought us some chinese fried rice since its my favorite food with some fries. We're Costarrican, so this isn't everyday food btw, this shits special.
As it was cold, and my boyfriend didn't show any interest in it since it ""looked weird"", I started cleaning HIS familys house, doing some leftover dishes, wiping the tables, cleaning the floors a little... so I could peacefully sit and eat the fried rice. I mean, I'm getting a little treat from his sister, might as well treat her by cleaning their house.
I was finishing everything up, I even air fried the fries separately so they wouldnt taste like microwave... and surprise, my boyfriend is now besides me, looking at the food with hungry eyes...... I thought to myself: ""Nah, he wouldn't eat the fries, he just ate a bunch of food..."". I washed a last dish and I turn and boom, one fry left on the plate. I caught him red handed.
I would've broken up with him for this. Like, dissapeared forever, for a bunch of fries... 

I was so angry, I wanted to scream, I felt a pressure in my chest, my eyes were crying before i even processed whatever happened... I wanted to die over some fries. And this happens all. the. time. over a thousand other things... 
I ended up angry for an hour or two until I stopped being mad and I asked him to say sorry to me because he clearly saw how much it hurt me... but its such a stupid thing, why am I even treating someone poorly over these stupid reasons???? What can I do?? How do I tell when I should be mad or when not to be mad, especially when I'm angry with my partner over past things that genuinely matter and hurt me? Even if i supposedly forgave him, I still bring those thoughts forth when we fight!!

Should I medicate?!?! Seriously. I dont know if it could work and I'm scared of medication making me lose my sparkle :/ ",1715016112.0,False,3,4,X4NDERE,None,1clondn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1clondn/how_to_tell_between_splittingsenseless_anger_vs/
26,Anxiety is ruining my life :(,"I literally don’t know how else to be. I am constantly overthinking and panicking and worrying and being indecisive and stressing out and I work 2 part time jobs so i never had be time to truly relax or have a proper day off. One of my jobs is something I’ve been wanting to do for years so I am so grateful for the opportunity but I am really struggling with the workload/time organisation and it’s making me work into the early hours of the morning 

My partner is getting really frustrated with me because I am always stressed and while I understand I just feel like he’s angry at me for feeling my feelings. When I try to talk about it he gets annoyed at me and tells me I need to do something about it and I agree but it’s so much easier said than done. 

I don’t really have any friends and I’ve not had time for social / fun stuff in a while (basically this year so far) and I feel like I have nobody. I don’t speak to most of my family and the ones that I do have are also busy. My mum is also sick right now (she just had an operation and we’re waiting to hear if she has cancer) and my dog is also old and sick and I’ve been looking after everyone.

I would love to just take a break from everything and get away by myself, I honestly can’t stand my life the way it is and i feel like I just annoy everyone around me because of my anxiety. 

I always feel like everyone is annoyed at me and like I’m not allllwed to feel the way I do and it makes me spiral and think I’m being stupid for even worrying but I also can’t help it

I have previously tried to get help from GP, been on different medications since I was 12 (I’m 25 now) and nothing had really helped. I pay for a private therapist that I see every 2 weeks and I enjoy the sessions but feel I can’t actually put the stuff we talk about into practise. I just feel like I’m a wrong human being. 

I feel like I’ve lost my personality as well, I don’t feel fun and I feel like I don’t have anything exciting to report ever

28,How can I help myself?,"First I want to apologize for the long post that you're about to read but I'm really losing my sanity at this point.

I (f 21) was dating a guy (20) for about two months, he was a virgin and I was his first ever , everything was going so so well , we are very compatible and I really liked him a lot and still do like him , he also liked me a lot , until..

Before we had sex for the first and last time ever he had talked to me about STDs and I told him that he has nothing to worry about because I have never had an STD , so two weeks later we have unprotected sex , and it was really really good , ten days later he started experiencing some symptoms like a burning sensation when he pees , white or clear discharge, his penis was red and swollen, and he was going crazy and he was very very anxious and scared (rightfully so) he went to a doctor and the doctor told him that it's probably gonorrhea and he told him to start with the medication that he prescribed to him after he got a test , the test came back negative, and I also did all the STDs tests and all of them came back negative as well . (For the record we are syrians and we live in syria , so we are very tight on money and the whole process of going to doctors and taking all the std tests was very dangerous because any kind of sexual activity before marriage is not okay here) .

This guy is now convinced that I gave him something and he doesn't want anything to do with me anymore, and he keeps calling me reckless (which I know I am I was diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago but my parents refused to believe it and didn't get me medication or treatment) .

My problem is that I was also too ignorant to believe it (because mental health is not really a thing in Syria) and now I feel like I desperately want him to stay in my life because I didn't do anything wrong, and I feel like my world is collapsing, and I know that I need to go to therapy and get treatment but I don't have any money, therapy is very expensive here and I don't know how to cope anymore, I truly saw something in him , and I feel like shit for losing him as a friend and as a lover , I didn't want things to go that way at all , and I don't know what to do.",1715932579.0,False,1,0,Unfair_Solution_2317,None,1ctzrvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ctzrvj/how_can_i_help_myself/

34,Just blew up and fucked things up ,"Would go to the normal BPD sub but I was banned for a no good reason. 
So basically I have BPD, ADHD, and some other things. I am not medicated for the ADHD due to my psychiatrist being a piece of shit. Today I looked at my grades (I’m in college) and I’m failing two of my classes because I’m unable to focus and get work done, I procrastinate a lot and I put my boyfriend above everything because he’s my ‘favorite person’. I am so fed up with being misunderstood and not listened to by my psychiatrist and I’m feeling incredibly impulsive, like criminally impulsive if you get what I’m getting at. I am so angry. I blew up on my mom and boyfriend and I’m at work right now so they are not with me but I was spamming them with texts and calls telling them I’m going to do something impulsive or hurt myself. My boyfriend is now mad at me and won’t talk to me because I scared him which is totally reasonable. I know I’m a bad person sometimes. But I am just so angry that they won’t put me on a stimulant to help me. I had anorexia but I’ve been in recovery for a year now and my eating disorder therapist cleared me for a stimulant but my psychiatrist won’t talk to her and she keeps putting me on diff meds like lithium and qelbree. I never took the lithium because I’ve been on too many mood stabilizers and anti psychotics and I don’t wanna turn into a zombie again. I’m not taking the qelbree because it’s not a stimulant. I’ve taken adderal before, and it helped so much. I would only take it on school days though because I like being frenzied when I’m sewing or working on my creative stuff. I don’t know what to do anymore, it feels like my world is crashing down around me and I’m starting to get those minor hallucinations and my mom said that I’m acting deranged right now. Which I think I am because of the things I said. I Can be so mean when i go thru episodes like this and I say some really fucked up shit. I just can’t keep living like this. Does anyone experience the same thing? Have any suggestions? Should I just continue to self medicate? I feel like I’m going crazy. Trust me the texts I sent were very very bad. I feel so guilty now. I want to punish myself. But I’ve made it so far (I used to self harm daily and had many attempts but I’ve been clean from those for a year now) I can’t fall back into those habits.

36,I just realized how my maniac episodes are nowadays when I thought i didn't have any for a long time,"I've been diagnosed with BPD about 5 years ago and tbh the medication, therapy and working my self-control issues helped me get a lot better, but today I realized that every time I start talking about stupid or crazy things that I am aware that I am not going to do, but I portrait them to the people around me as if they were an actual possibility (like today when I was telling my brother how I could form a cult without a problem at 25) is that I am actually having a manic episode (like I went on and on for like 3 hours straight of how I would be able to form a fucking cult/my own nation, yeah super delulu ik) and on one hand I am afraid to tell my psychiatrist and worry him, making him medicate me even more (or worse, lock me) but on the other hand I'm relieved to know that my BPD manifests my manic episodes in this way instead of in a violent or really self-destructive way, I mean I know it's not right but it's better that it just me bluffing about doing crazy shit while being 100% aware that I'm not talking seriously than actually believing that as a reality or having any kind of reaction that hurts people or myself in any way. Although, what satisfies my ""craving for chaos"" is making people think that I am dead serious, I am aware that it is actually a joke, but it amuses me to see the reaction of the others. Is it wrong? Should I talk to my psychiatrist, even if I'm afraid of the consequences this may cause? If I'm not doing real harm to anyone, maybe there's no need to talk about it. Like, on one side I want to tell people that I don't really think like that and that it's just my way of coping so they don't worry but that would take away the whole point of it/ what's satisfying this internal urgency that I have and in the other side, perhaps by not having this coping mechanism I may develop another one that is really harmful/problematic/self-destructive. But at the same time I don't want them to worry but that reaction is what makes this coping mechanism work and cover whatever it has to cover, so that it fulfills its function. 

Like i want to talk about it with someone but I'm afraid that this will change the way they perceive me (in case it's a friend)/ it will no longer generate that reaction that ""entertains"" my need for chaos (in case it's my brother or family)/ leads me to have a more severe diagnosis or one that generates consequences when trying to fix something that, in the end, doesn't harm anyone (if I tell my psychiatrist) or generates a new coping mechanism that does lead me to do something bad to satisfy my need for ""adrenaline"" (in case my psychiatrist cures this one somehow).

I don't like ""living in peace"", I don't know how to do it, it bores me, and for now this is the healthiest way I can maintain a normal life and not do something stupid just to feel some rush.

Should I keep it to myself or talk about it with someone? For now, the person who I feel that could understand it better, give me an objective opinion and not judge me, would be my psychiatrist, BUT he is also the one who could generate the worst ""consequences"" for me In case he finds out, also, I was the only patient he actually enjoyed talking to and just had some issues but wasn't really crazy. I think this would really change that and if I tell him our sessions won't be like ""opening up to a friend"" anymore and it might become like any other medical appointment, which I don't want to bc i felt really safe talking to him and we made a lot of progress this way...

47,I sleep 14 hours a day and I am exhausted constantly ,"I would sleep more but I will my way through it.  I used to have a medical cannabis card in Montana but a shitty living situation forced me to move to my mom's in Utah, then a week after that I had a psychotic episode and called a crisis line where they pink sheeted me at an ER and I freaked out and ran away from the nurse and accidentally broke a door, then went to jail and now I'm out awaiting trial and will most likely be put on probation so I won't be able to apply for a card in this state due to that.  I was recommended lithium by a therapist in the past and have an appointment with a doctor to see if I can get a prescription but it isn't until next week.  I feel like absolute garbage all the time and can't find joy in anything (and to the anti weed people, no it's not withdrawal I quit cold turkey January 25th and you don't get withdrawal from cannabis past 5 days).  No matter what activities I do I can't feel happy and have vivid nightmares about my past every night without fail.  I try to be healthy and have been eating healthy food and working out 6 days a week (just moderate ppl though not overtraining) so I don't think it's a physical issue.  I have tried so many herbal supplements and my mother's trazodone (which I stopped after 4 days because I couldn't even walk 20ft) and all of them just make me even more tired.

48,Advice seeking diagnosis?,"Asking because my mother strongly believe I have ADHD and or bipolar. The ADHD bit most likely true, awaiting diagnosis. I don't believe I have bipolar though. After researching the reasoning for my black and white thinking and tip of a hat mood swings, I think it's almost identical to symptoms of BPD. I am just unsure of what to do about it because I think I may need medication and definitely therapy. Unfortunately my doctor's a fucking quack and I can't talk to anyone when I'm actually in the midst of my feelings so when I'm actually able to call up, I just get asked do you want to end your own life right now, or harm yourself. The answer WILL be no because I'm not feeling that way at the times I'm able to call, I explain that it switches at a tip of a hat and is completely uncontrollable sometimes. So they say okay that's good call back when you do. WHICH I FUCKING CAN'T WHEN I FEEL THAT WAY! WHICH I EXPLAIN! Yet the answer is call back when you feel like that. I don't know what to do. I'm worried I may be a danger to myself and he just brushes it off. My mother has even sent MANY angry emails saying can you listen to my son please and it's always the same. It's only getting worse.

51,I am on the verge of giving up on life and i need help.,"I (24 female) have been diagnosed with bpd 2 years ago. I’ve gone through lots of therapy and lots of medications but it feels like no matter how hard i try i always go back to my older self the minute i am triggered. I feel stressed and tired of life and i feel so alone. I work a full time job while attending university (studying engineering) at the same time and its been so hard on me. I am all alone in life which means i had to work and figure things on my own since i was 16 years old and i am so exhausted. I am trying to do better and be a better person, friend and partner but its like i am the most despicable person to them so i don’t blame anyone for abandoning me but it’s so hard one me cuz i am trying and i don’t want to be that person but i cant. 

It feels like I’ve hit rock bottom and my life is a mess. I am on academic probation due to my declining gpa and grades even though i am trying my best i am attending every class doing everything on time studying well before every exam but i seem to be doing something wrong cuz my grades don’t reflect that. My job isn’t going that well it’s so stressful and triggering and i am overworking myself cuz I can’t lose it or i will be homeless with my university tuition, rent, bills etc…., My house is a total mess its disgusting  i am so embarrassed to show it to anyone its the worse it has ever got though i live in a tiny space. 

My relationship with my partner isn’t going that well and i am mainly the reason why. He supported me more than anyone in my life and been there for me through everything but when it comes to mental illnesses he doesn’t really understand what i am going through and keeps trying to encourage me in the wrong way with things that work for normal people or for him not for someone who is suffering from crippling anxiety and depression as well as bpd. Though he is trying to change his views.

And i need help cuz i can’t do this anymore and i want to give up i see no hope for future the harder i try the worse it gets and though i love my partner more than life and is the i only person in my life, he is better off without me i hurt him so much that I can’t even forgive myself anymore though he worked through it all with me. I cant do this life anymore i have nothing to look forward to and honestly don’t want anything. 

Also, I struggled with self harm, alcoholism, and drug abuse but i worked through all that but these days the only thing on my mind is to just get black out drunk though I’ve been sober for a year. And its so hard to battle my urges.

. November 22nd partner and father of unborn child was deported
.  November 28th found out I had gestational diabetes

* to note.. my fiance is my FP... we don't talk much right now as he is busy getting his life back to ""normal""

The most recent boundary/ feeling I expressed was feeling objectifed bc it seemed/ seems like all he cares about is being intimate but that's really it. Well right before the holidays [Christmas] I had an appointment ye ol shrink and got bumped up from emd [ episodic mood disorder] to straight up BPD [ sib cat. Quiet or discouraged] which after talking to the doctor and some people ik who also have this, that there's not much meds can really do to ""get rid of it"" and I've told this to my bf and said I'm going to up my appointments. He essentially flipped out on me bc according to him, I need meds bc he went to school for nurse stuff [failed whatever is before RN due poor life choices]. During his explanation he aggressively flipped over his coffee table and broke several candles while say "" honestly I could get drunk and go to any bar and get whoever I want"" which I'll admit still hurts...

54,Just found out my whole life would have been different if i did not have BPD. Or dealt with it better.,"To start off all the major decisions were not rational but emotional. The biggest one being a career, i could have been a doctor, an enginner or anything, i actually got into good engineering colleges and did the steps fpr applying to medical college.... what did i become, a designer, fr i wasn't even good at sketching, just someone really average.

My relationships, my friendships everything was different of my highly emotional behaviour, splits, manipulation, obsessiveness and everything.......

Even choosing a job is irrational, even as a designer, i left the job that i was really good at, where i felt i was at the top, the fucking top. Getting paid the top. I left it, why, it was fucking stable.... ahhhh for fucks sake, this is not normal. 

I'm in a job that pays like 10 times less, different field, and why???, just because its challenging for me........ why? Why? WHY?

Getting into relationships is hard, maintainjng them is more hard, hooking up is more hard, everything just ends me up in a fucking void.

I keep thinking of me without BPD, taking rational decisions, having a better life... for real, if i had made a rational decision at any one of these fucking points in my life,  i would have been so far succesful, in career or in relationships.

57,How do you handle conflicting diagnoses from different doctors?,"Ugh I've always thought my psychiatrist was kind of shit, he apparently worships Reagan and only spends like 10 minutes a session with me and keeps asking me if I'm religious and when am I going back to church??? (Left the church years ago having been raised in it and never looked back)

I hate that he doesn't advertise himself as Christian focused but does this to his patients. Anyway... my lovely psychiatrist left and I was handed over to a new one in her office a long time ago. And I feel too over it to care. He gives me my meds, I want to take them at this dose, he agrees whatever. 


But a legitimate psychologist (my therapist) who I find to be very sane, thoughtful, caring, and intelligent has recently diagnosed me with Borderline. I brought this to my psychiatrist of 10ish years and was met with the standard, ""you dont have that, those patients are very hard to deal with, you're very easy to deal with, you dont want that."" I think it's relevant that I'm relatively quiet, with high social anxiety, avoidant, and a  high-functioning variant of Borderline, meaning I can hold a steady full-time office job and a relationship of a couple years. But it's the first in my life longer than 3 months where he isn't abusive. And it really only started being functional after I restarted medications, which I've quit cold turkey several times in my life during depressive episodes.

Ok, first of all, as if I chose to have this disorder. Second, does having BPD necessitate breaking down in front of the psychiatrist and telling him to fucking hurt himself or something?? Does it necessitate a history of alcoholism or inpatient or cutting?  Has he spent more than ten minutes with me in a session in this whole year? Did he give any thought to the diagnosis other than to say ""well, I don't want to deal with another one, so I'm going to deny that's even possible and hope things stay the same""

Like wtf man is it because you think I have a dumb female therapist, Mr. Christian Republican know-it-all? She is a licensed psychologist who has been practicing for decades and has also treated borderlines before. Ofc, he didn't care to find that out, just hurried me out of his virtual office. Fucking making bank off being lazy and careless with patients like me. 

So idk if it's even a conflicting diagnosis, because he seemed not to even look into it or even want to acknowledge it. But my therapist has diagnosed me and we started going through DBT. 

I want to know if any of you have dealt with having your reality questioned by doctors, and how common it really is to be misdiagnosed with BPD, maybe if you really had something else going on. 

I've only heard that it's common to be misdiagnosed with bipolar, but in my case my mood swings are very clearly shorter and attributed to triggering events, I'm def not bipolar. My past diagnoses are complex PTSD, GAD, panic disorder with OCD features, and some mild depressive episodes. 

Anyway, what are your experiences with misdiagnoses?

59,Advice -,"I don't know how to start this. I need some guidance and perhaps support, but I feel I have completely fucked up my life. Rewind two years ago; I was living in a metropolitan area and working for a company that appeared to have a great trajectory and opportunities for travel. I had a tribe of friends that were smart, supportive and loving. Unfortunately, I did come out of a turbulent breakup, unleashing my most severe BPD symptoms. I moved back to my hometown to continue working remotely, a blessing in normal circumstances. From there, things started spiralling; I was in a messy family dynamic, including being around a very mentally ill family member who came to live with us. His verbal abuse and mean nature were triggering. I could go on about his mental health and the domino effects it causes my nuclear family and me.  

Compiled with the massive change to my living situation, I was triggered by my parents and their shortcomings and their current living situation, making me feel completely insecure in my ability to thrive. 

I was isolated physically and remotely, using marijuana as a coping mechanism. I didn't have the same support system withdrawing from loved ones and cutting people off for no good reason. Until recently, it felt like I was completely broken inside, being held together with an eggshell-like body embracing me in some physical normality. I have since been on better medications and feel like a whole person, not using marijuana and eating regularly but lacking a routine. 

In January, I was let go from my job due to covid and the lack of revenue. My rejection sensitivity went off, and I withdrew and did not collect my last paycheque from work and have not worked since or collected social assistance. I am broke. I had built up my credit and savings until then, I could kind of live off my savings. I didn't think I could find a job, feeling like I should have thrived in a better position by now, and now I feel like I fucked myself over in every way. I've cut off all of my tribe of friends, not working, and feel fucking lost. 

I know I need to reach out to my old employer, apologize, collect my last pay cheque, try and get social security, continue applying for jobs and reach out and apologize to friends in the hope I can build my life back up. But I don't know if any of that is possible.

60,Dating app advice,"I recently came across a guy on a dating app whom I went on a couple dates with in 2015. (I'm very good with remembering faces!) At that time in my life, I was incredibly dysregulated and undiagnosed/untreated, and was using sex and substances as coping/connection.

Out of curiosity, I looked back at our texts. Apparently, we sexted A LOT and, also apparently, had sex once or twice. (I have very poor recall of this time.) We ended things after he stopped responding and I got prickly and confronted him. He apologized and told me I was ""amazing and beautiful,"" and that I deserve honesty. He said he gotten sick, and during that time he realized that he wants a relationship, which at the time I said I did not want. I got mad and texted something snide, and he did not respond. I totally get it. Again, dysregulation.

Now in 2023, I am looking for a relationship. I'm medicated, in therapy, and actively working on getting my life together. I remember liking him, and would be interested in seeing him again.

Part of my BPD means that I get SO excited about someone, and then do Too Much.

My question is, would it be weird if I texted him again, after 8 years, to say that I saw him on the app and would be down to reconnect if he is? Is that Too Much?

63,I left because of fear and love,"I thought that I had recovered pretty well through therapy and medication but once I found myself having romantic feelings for someone again, I started to spiral and have outbursts. I just ended things after a year and a half because I’d rather end on good terms than burn everything to the ground. In no way did my partner deserve the kind of treatment I would give when I’d split or when the rage got the best of me. It’s breaking me apart to let go but I cannot keep going forward knowing that I am hurting my favorite human in the world, the person I’m supposed to cherish and protect. I was never physically abusive but I was dismissive and recently I had actually raised my voice, yelling at the poor person because I was drowning in my own emotions. I didn’t want to end things but I had to push them away to save them from me. I’d rather be alone than to keep hurting them and they would rather be alone than to keep being abused by me, which is entirely understandable because I know that my actions are in fact abusive. I love them so much but I feel like my love is volatile because the more I care, the worse I become. I just want to be able to love without poisoning the other person. I’ve tried so hard to do and be better but it seems fruitless. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just feel broken and like I’m meant to be alone because I’m too much for even me, so how is anyone else supposed to weather the storm? I’ve never been so well loved or taken care of and it’s almost everything I’ve wanted but I kept demanding more, kept finding things to be disgruntled about, and would be set off by the most insignificant things. We never had a defined relationship and that always stirred insecurities but my behavior didn’t help to create any confidence in the bond. I know they were trying so hard to meet my needs but my list kept growing or unresolved things kept coming up. I just want to be soft, to be loved, to feel safe but it seems like I am a poison to myself and everyone around me because I am filled with so much rage and grief. It has nowhere to go. I can’t keep doing this to people who try to love me and I’m so afraid of being alone forever but it doesn’t stop. I’m suffocating.

64,Not a good day ,"My mom started using the fact that I'm in bail (previous post explains why but before you immediately assume I'm the worst it was for accidently breaking a door at a hospital.  Nothing violent/sexual) to scare me all the time saying she regrets helping me out ""my friends say I shouldn't have"" (ftr my mom's ""friends"" are all her Mormon relatives who hate me for having long hair etc) and she kept saying I was a loser for not working when I DO have a job and it was my day off.  Even though it was my day off I was working on a level design project which, while in the form of a mod, is something I'm using to eventually use as a kind of resume but she wouldn't understand and thought I was just being lazy.  Then I freaked out and punched through the dry wall and went for a drive with my dogs.  Then my mom asked me to come back home.  My hand is super bruised which surprises me because when I was in jail I would punch the shit out of a concrete wall and it never bruised.

I know everyone's experience is different but even though I've been officially diagnosed it just feels wrong to say I have it after hearing other people's history and experience with it.

66,BPD w/ SUD,"1. I was diagnosed with BPD back in 2021 at the age of 32.
2. Tried to join a 52 week program on dialectical behavior therapy. The program was twice a week once for group & once for individual therapy. However, you had to be accepted into the program and at that time due to substance abuse, they felt the money spent (self pay) and active SUD I would not be a good candidate for their program. 
3. After that I found myself thinking well if I can’t even makes it into DBP then how the heck will their be any improvements. So fuck it! 
4. I have found been self isolating since given the news and not really put much into place with the expedition of medication management and meet with my psychiatrist once a month. 
5. I have not found self isolating to be such a bad thing till recently. Also, at the time mid Covid pandemic, and I submerged myself into continuing to grow my real estate brokerage. Business has been great! However, self love self care and therapy went to the back burner. In the meantime SUD has progressed. 
6. I am looking for a treatment center that has a detox and residential program that offers more of a deep dive into DBT but also allows for an hour or so each day before or after group to use my phone and computer. Dropping off the face of the earth when you are a small business owner is nearly impossible. Who is going to pay for the health insurance to stay in treatment? Often times the treatment is out of network or self pay so money needs to still come in. I have employees that are counting on me and their families. 
7. In my search for this type of facility it’s been very difficult some have been willing to accommodate but it’s going to be 4 in my search for this type of facility it’s been very difficult some have been willing to accommodate but it’s going to be $40,000 to $50,000 - others it’s an absolutely hard no - or they might offer the work accommodation but little or zero focus on DBT. 

Any suggestions on facilities to consider?

I can barely stand to go to work because of all the triggers causing panic attacks.  When I'm home all I can think about is the best way to end everything.

I go to every thereopy sessions, do my journal, follow my breathing techniques, and follow my meds to a tee.  

I feel like I'm getting nowhere and more and wore out.  I think more about how I can get legally high with OTC so I can a few minutes of joy.  Or where  I can comfortably open my wrists and feel the life leave me and float to sleep.  

I don't want to go back to the hospital because the nurses refused to give me the medications I needed to survive. I have physical conditions outside BPD but they treated me like shit until I filed a complaint.  Oddly enough they sent me home the next day.

68,Struggling a bit with a breakup and overall hard life.,"Edit: I’m sorry for not responding to the comments; I deeply appreciate the support.  I’ve been really trying not to panic over my situation and working on not being homeless.  I know that I cannot support myself financially because of my mental illness, and my mental illness + trauma (from not just the breakup but a LOT of other things back to back over the last two years) cannot get better with the looming threat of homelessness and lack of proper medical attention.   I’ve just sorta been unhinged for days now.  But I’m still here. 



There’s a lot to unpack and if I went into details, this post would be really long and probably unappealing to read (because of length).

I don’t have very many friends and I don’t have any family at all.  My partner broke up with me a few days ago (they had left me at the exact same time last year as well in a way that was extremely traumatic).  

I’m really doing my best to work through my feelings but I only see a therapist once a month and have been back on medication for about two month due to insurance bullshit. 

I don’t want to call a suicide hotline; but I really need someone to talk to, or just check in with me.  Being alone is scary but it really is amplified when you have no skills as an adult and no family.

My second time posting about this because I don’t know what else to do with myself, this is killing me and at the very least it helps to vent, i have no one to vent to or to speak to, shouting into the void doesn’t help, crying about it doesn’t help, so I might as well talk about it on here. Ive had some lovely people respond to me on BPD subreddits here and I appreciate their support and advice much more than I can express, so if you were one of those people, thank you.

Its been 23 hours since I (M19) last spoke to my fp (M20) after he was sent to the psych ward for what will likely be a week or so, I know at face value it does not seem like a long time but these hours have been torture. We both have BPD and mutual fps on each other, before all of this, we were together 24/7, it sounds like an exaggeration but one look at our call logs and you’d be mistaken. We were constantly on the phone, if not calling, texting or on video-chat (I am unable to visit him due to college.) We are completely open with each other, we sleep together, eat together, bathe together, It’s really hard to separate. This is the first time we’ve had to officially separate for longer than an hour or two, this is killing me.

I’ve tried to distract myself but I have nothing else to do but cry and feel empty and lonely, this has only proved to me that I have no one else but him, I am completely and utterly alone, I’ve tried to reach out to an old friend who was like a brother to me but despite being online, I have received no response, it almost feels like a slap to the face, after being there for him every single time he needed me, I can’t have a single time he returns the favor, I am alone, no one gives a fuck out of me, I wish I could just end this all but I know I can’t, I promised him I wouldn’t do anything but I can feel myself shaking, I’m desperate for something or someone to realize that I’m at my fucking breaking point, i just want someone to prove they care, i want someone to ask me if I’m ok for once, i want to do something else but sleep and cry, I’m fucking tired, I’m so fucking sad and so fucking angry amd so fucking empty.

On a different note, i spoke to my psychiatrist and she said i could go back on my medication since the hives that I mentioned in my last post were likely from stress so at least I’m not unmedicated now.

72,(TW) Bpd x bpd relationship. Advice?,"Hi. I never use reddit and just made this account like 10 mins ago so please excuse if I'm not really doing this right. And sorry for the length I've added a ""TLDR"" at the end (is that how you do it?)
TW Substance abuse, Institutions, Suicidal Ideation, Psychosis, Police Brutality, Eating Disorders (possible other tw I forgot to mention)
I am F20 dating someone with bpd M24. We have known each other a year now (started relationship April 2023 then both didnt talk for 3 months May 2023-Sep 2023 because we both went to rehab in different places) and honestly the way we met kinda.. will raise some red flags for some people but honestly I am not looking for anyone to comment on that aspect. We met in a psych ward in April 2023. Both at super low points. I was in a severe manic/psychotic episode as I also struggle with bipolar disorder. I had stayed up for 4 nights straight and maybe eaten 2 meals during that time. When I got there I weighed under 100 pounds. I was having delusions and convinced myself I had alters. I had no idea that the guy I was with was giving me weed that was laced with benzos. He also had laid hands on me and cheated during the relationship as well. I didnt even find out I tested positive for the benzos until a while later. The psychward I went to was absolutaly disgusting and also didn't tell me I had very abnormal blood levels and forced psych meds down my throat. I don't even think it was the right time to start those meds with my weight and health issues and substances in my body. It was pretty much medical abuse. And it was my second ever time, besides when I was 16, going to a mental hospital. My boyfriend, on the other hand, was considered a ""frequent flyer."" He struggled with lots of substance abuse and suicidal thoughts. I would find out later that he admitted himself this time because he was feeling awful about not having his old FP. When I first saw him, he mentioned having BPD in a group therapy and explaining how it was affecting him. My ears perked up listening to him. He was just a great talker, vulnerable, and accountable for himself. I don't remember a lot from when we first met because of all the different things going on with my brain, but I talked to him by passing him a note (I think the note may have been about the staff at the psych ward.) We both began talking the whole time we were there after that. There was absolutely no activities, the staff treated us like utter garbage, and we both were too restless to just sit around all day. We would talk ""walks"" down the hallways just talking. About everything. There was so much chemistry. He somehow knew how exactly to calm me down. We both knew how to make eachother laugh. He was optimistic, despite how awful different circumstances he had were. Way more optimistic than me. He pointed out a big photo on the wall of a colorful wave and said to pretend we were taking a walk on the beach together.  We also did have one activity room we would go in maybe once out of the whole week that had a piano and some playing cards. I played Heart and Soul as a duet with him. We somehow made that awful situation we were in into something enjoyable. As days passed, he started opening up about how he had a charge of battery on an officer. Basically, he was in the same mental hospital we were in at the time, and he was having an episode. He is a black man with tattoos, so everyone just treated him as if he was dangerous and aggressive before he even got to any point like that. I don't know exactly what happened, but they didn't attempt to deescalate at all. A police officer came over to slam him against the wall and tell him ""you'd be better off dead."" He then spit in the officers direction. And that's it. He didn't hit him or attempt to hit him.  Because of covid, that action he took is considered battery against a police officer, and he was looking at a minimum of 10 years in prison for it. The case is still ongoing as we speak. He's doing a mental health diversion to get the felony off his record, and he's trying to get the case dropped. If the case is dropped, he plans to sue. So basically, everything has been extremely stressful for both of us the entire time we have known each other. But we connect so well. I have never felt so much love and passion for someone. After the mental hospital, we hung out for weeks. We did smoke a lot of weed together and both of us started getting worse mentally. I got sent to psych 2 more times after the first time and then got transferred to residential on the 3rd time. The 3rd time I went was because I went to his house, had severe psychosis, and he had to call the police on me. We weren't really together for quite a few months and I even broke off talking to him because I needed to recover. Then, I reached out again in September. We both relapsed, and I would see him once a week so my use was weekly and his was daily. He lives with his mother who has a medical card and gives him free weed. Now, we both are over 2 weeks sober and plan to stay that way. But the relationship had gotten tense and strained. We don't use escapism for our feelings anymore. We even quit nicotine. We started eating healthy, exercising, and finding ourselves. But it's so hard. I know people say two sick people can't get better together, but I just want to prove them wrong. I want us to be healthy. So many things make us insecure. We are both terrified of losing each other. We both want to get out of our triggering households together. But we both struggle with things. I'm going back to regular talk therapy and he's about to start his therapy too. I even want to do couples therapy. But money is a huge issue. He couldn't work for the entire time we have been together. I've only had a part-time retail job that pays 13 an hour. He's been mad that I'm working way more and seeing him less. I'm trying to explain that I'm doing this for us. It hurts him because he wants to be a caretaker and he wants to be the breadwinner. But realistically, I'm the one who can work rn. And I'm even struggling with that as well because I got in a car accident in an Uber and my back is messed up. The pain is making me constantly irritated. Please. I know a lot of people might say this doesn't seem like it's possible it could work, but I want some optimism. Me and him both want it to work and are willing to do anything we possibly can to make it work. Any advice is so appreciated. Thank you.

I feel weirdly happy here sometimes, it's far away its in the woods I feel hidden from the world and safe from bailiffs but sometimes I miss having a private garden, being able to do my washing indoors, not having to interact with neighbours, living in a house that doesn't get freezing cold at night and boiling hot during the day. I've tried to make a go of things on Tumblr but I guess I don't click with gen zers on there so most of the time I get blocked or ignored for absolutely no reason 😕 I try to be friendly and not reblog things that sound OTT but I guess it doesnt work, this girl who was my sort of FP (who also has BPD) seems to hate me because she's convinced I made a blog that was similar to hers she's also been getting friendly with another girl who she equally didn't like who made a fan blog similar to hers yet she's completely blanking me the whole thing feels sooooo school yard tbh. 

My family can't be bothered to see each other and they're not especially close they're all alcoholic narcissists, me and my sister sort of get on but despite her being my carer and getting money for it she's sort of pulled the rug out from under me the last couple of years to focus on writing and making candles as well as furthering her popularity on social media and I can't help but feel a bit sore over it I guess like for example tomorrow I really needed to see the doctor to talk about my weight and my facial hair (I suspect I have PCOS) as well as discussing the possibility of going on better medication but I can't get there because I don't drive and I live literally 20 mins away from everything even a supermarket so I can't even get a bus.

I've been trying to focus on making my caravan nice and wanting to do computer art of pictures of me and my boyfriend of all the festivals and holidays we've been to but everytime I look at these pictures of me I feel so depressed at how much I hate the way I look 😭.

76,I can’t believe I’m doing this,"TRIGGER WARNING: suicide, self harm and all that bad mental health stuff. (Sorry if I did that wrong). 

Hi redditors. I’ve never posted before. Thanks for reading and responding if you choose to do so. I’m sorry if the following triggers you or if you are struggling with the same brand of futile terrible I am. 

I’m at a point in my life where I’ve struggled so much and for so long that I’m just exhausted. I’m not angry or bitter or sad anymore; I just want it to be over. I’m tired of being confused all the time, completely disconnected from this thing called ‘life’ everyone seems to be switched into. I’m tired of being panicky and depressed and anxious all at the same time, almost all the time. Im tired of being at the mercy of my insane mood swings where I'm experiencing overlapping interchanges of all these conflicting emotions all day long. I'm tired of crying so often that it feels like my brain is going to explode in my own head and my eyes will just cease to function properly. I’m tired of being dismissed when I say I’m unwell (psychiatrist included) because ‘I’m doing so well’ - I don’t even know what this means or how you could conclude that from someone whose chronically unemployed, can’t finish uni or even leave the house or make eye contact with people without panicking. I feel like an absolute rotting turd most of the time despite what I’m putting out there (which feels to me like a shit show but to other people for some reasons seems completely normal).

People seem to consistently make this crazy assumption that I’m ‘intelligent and capable’ for some reason and therefore I don’t need help. They couldn’t be more wrong. I can’t accomplish basic tasks because I’m emotionally all over the place all the time and trying to do basic human things like pick what to wear in the morning sends me into shame spirals, suicidal thoughts and urges to self harm. I have no control over my emotions or impulses, I’m constantly floating away from my body and nothing feels real. I’m incapable of accepting any kind of affection or goodwill from others without completely self destructing and I don’t want to burden others so my relationships are nonexistent. 

I’ve dealt with thoughts, feelings, urges and attempts of suicide my entire life. Its pretty much always been a terrifying backup in the back of my mind ever since I can remember as a safety plan to escape the torture of life where I can always feel exactly how close I am to death. Some days feel a magnetism to it but a strong resolve to resist. Other days, I’m basically hanging on by a thread and not telling anyone so they don’t come and take me from my home against my will again. 

I just want the freedom to be able to make this decision on my own. I did not give consent to be born, and I don’t think it’s ethical to keep someone alive against their will when they are suffering chronically and there isn’t a solution. 

I just feel like there’s no way out. I don’t respond to medications and suffer from such severe side effects that my psychiatrist refuses to prescribe any more drugs. My old psychiatrist had me on 5 different meds and I was equally bad, maybe worse, but in a completely different way. Those who have had adverse reactions to medications will understand this. Being mentally ill or being on psychiatric medication is like choosing if you want death by drowning or self-immolation.

I do DBT group therapy, see a psychologist and psychiatrist but I still feel like absolute shit. Everyone seems to be going through the motions, ticking all the boxes, but I just feel like nothing has really shifted. No amount of bandaids is going to help me when I’m walking around absolutely raw with no fucking skin on my body. It’s excruciating to just be alive but because it’s not visible, and it’s a slow death, nobody cares and the state ‘has a responsibility’ to keep you alive. In my experience, everyone is all sad when someone kills them selves, but also calls them selfish because they’ve left so much pain in their wake. Being passed around a mental health care system that can’t really help you, is insanely expensive and practically useless makes me miss the days when I didn’t seek help, suffered in silence but could at least hold on to the hope that there was a possibility of getting better if I had the right help. Now I know that’s not even an option. 

I’m just doomed to relive this cycle of extreme pain, possible suicide, absurdity, exhaustion, sheer terror, panic attacks, extreme mood swings, paranoia, catatonia, confusion, dissociation, spontaneous stuttering, paralysis and fatigue, where I can’t seem to express myself clearly no matter how hard I try or connect with other people. 

I am incapable of feeling positive emotions. No matter how hard I try, I just can’t stop the anxiety, panic, negativity, paranoia and depression from seeping in. I fear my emotions, I fear my thoughts and the things in life I can’t control that are going to hurt me so I just live in a constant state of sheer paralysis, frozen in fear and bracing myself for impact.

The only thing that’s keeping me alive is the thought that my sister will have to deal with the trauma of my suicide. But it also seems like it should be unethical to keep a person in this much chronic pain alive. I can feel my body deteriorating, my mind is basically scrambled eggs at this point, and I feel like I’m at the mercy of an emotionally handicapped body that I have zero control over. I keep harming myself and those around me. I just want to die with a little bit of dignity but there doesn’t seem to be a way out.

Life seems to be one trauma after the next, and continued reluctant attempts to help myself that only end up in things getting worse. I was not made for this world. I wasn’t supposed to be here. Please let me go. I don’t want to hurt anyone but I’m so tired now. Please tell me this will all be over soon.",1596368916.0,False,11,7,sarahthehumanperson,None,i2asxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/i2asxt/i_cant_believe_im_doing_this/

80,Chaos,"(Tw: talk of suicide attempts, assault and breakups)

Hey everyone so I posted about a week and a half ago on some of these subreddits about my polyamorous relationship and had been looking for advice, I appreciated all the comments but I thought I should update on the events that played out.

So Friday of one of the weeks (my timelines a little blurry) I was laying in bed with my live in partner and he hyped me up to go on an adventure with him and despite having been fine laying in bed all day I got excited and started to get ready for our adventure.. midway through he told me that our two partners who had been having complaints about me needed him there by 5 pm (2.5 hours away from the current time but he had agreed to hang out til 9 pm) I expressed my disappointment and how uncomfortable it made me feeling left out and feeling abandoned.. (I added this part in because I'm trying to get everything in and forgot to add this part it was also part of why I wanted to talk written below)

I communicated my discomfort with my live in partner about the polycule and explained how I didn't feel like 2 of the others really understood me so I explained that I'd like all 5 of us to sit down and have a conversation (for the benefit of this story we have partner A and B that live together, Partner C that lives with me and partner D that lives alone but is best friends as well with partner B) 

C explained to A and B that I was uncomfortable and would like to have a sit down to talk about things because as it stood I felt unheard, judged and uncomfortable in our situation and I had spoke to him that night about it on the phone and I thought I was finally getting through to some extent..

I met up with C the next day and found out that he slept with B that night (this was the first time and he had also kissed her) this hurt my feelings a lot because I felt so unheard and disrespected so I needed to take a whole step back from the situation so I left our groups for the time being, blocked both A and B and I had a panic attack where I called my best friend because he told me out in public so I was literally sobbing and hyperventilating in public.. I had no problem with the fact that they slept together but just how disrespectful it was as I did my best to communicate my feelings.. I asked C to tell A and B I needed space and just couldn't right now.

After spending most of the night in a conversation with C where I was having a break down and my best friend sat there to be a bystander to make sure neither of us did anything dumb C ended up getting A and B to pick him up and breaking up with me.

The next day when I woke up and had calmed down and had been communicating lots with D between then and the morning both D and C told me I shouldn't message A and B but I felt bad for abruptly leaving and wanted to express I was sorry and explain my side of the story.. 

A mostly kept quiet and just sent me a link to a mental health place but said he didn't want to talk to me which was fine I respected that and I did not reply afterwards.

B however went off on a huge rant about how I apparently have been abusing C for 4 years and he has Stockholm and all this stuff and then told me to disappear.. for that day it really really got in my head and I found everything unbearable my brain hyper fixated so I shut off my location on everything and went to get medication and I wrote a note with no ill will or hard feelings to anyone inside just letting people know I always loved them and that I was sorry I had to do this.. I had blocked B on some social media but then she started going off texting me unprompted making it go into my head harder..

I had been messaging D all day and he could tell I was not alright and I took a lot of medication after a while and asked if he was scared to die.. I felt extremely alone.. word got out to everyone and my best friend rushed to my house and C got A and B to drive him to my house.

B came into my house and tried to lunge at me, I had to slam the door to separate us as I'm a passafist and don't like conflict and I was very confused why she was trying to attack me after telling me to disappear and telling me I had no redeeming qualities..

Once she left the house I came out and realized my phone was gone so I went upstairs and opened the front door to ask C if he had my phone and B was closed by and lunged at me again, again I made a barrier by slamming the door and things are a blur but I think I hit her with the door because I remember once I opened it again A got in my face but he didn't touch me so I can at least respect that.. 

C did have my phone so I had went outside to get it from him and I was standing near him and like balling my eyes out and my best friend showed up, B attacked me again but this time I had no wall to put between us she was grabbing and pulling me but a cop had shown up and saw it and he shoved her away from me and told her to go to her car.. I was urged to press charges but I have chose not to do this because I just want peace not violence.. I'm exahusted..

Once in the hospital they went through the normal steps of poison control and all that I won't go into too much detail but my best friend stayed with me til really late at night (she has a child and her brother isn't old enough to watch him for too long) 

The next day I spoke to the psychologist who deemed me not a threat to myself and let me leave but she has put me on a waiting list for a DBT program and I was already waiting on a counselling appointment on the 10th so she was happy with that. She told me she believes I did my best by stepping back from a situation that had triggered a lot of emotions so I didn't blow up and that I also made the steps to resolve the issue afterwards and she told me that I can't control how others react to what I say.. she's right but it's still hard..

Since then I have had 0 contact with A and B, C has visited a couple of times and I've been doing my best.. D and I message every single day and he's visited over night once and has also had a long phone call with me.. he's been my biggest support and every time I see or talk to C it feels suffocating.. I can feel his disinterest and it hurts.. anyways I just guess I wanted to give an update so I didn't leave anyone hanging since I know there's replies I hadn't gotten to because everything happened so fast.. anyways I'm single now and trying to find some kind of motivation to live.. I want to be motivated but as it stands breathing is even exhausting and I'm only living because other people don't want me to die and I know that's no way to live.",1712535842.0,False,5,1,PsychoLittleKitten,None,1byk0yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1byk0yj/chaos/

82,Trigger advice.,"I would like some help. My main trigger is my ex partner. We were together for 6 years. We have 2 kids together. We split up because our relationship got insanely toxic. We would have killed each other. 
I still have to deal with her obviously because we have kids together. I suspect that she has anti-social personality disorder as she is incapable of accepting any responsibility for any wrong doings. 
Every time we speak, i feel myself escalating to the point where i explode into a full bpd rage meltdown. I don't want this to happen anymore.

83,How do you deal with tense environments?,"I’m kind of an empath and deal with my emotions and others emotions (tone of voice, body language, and so on) differently than those around me. I’ve read a lot of things on how others feel the same or have the same problems as me but I don’t see a lot on how to deal with it. 

I just recently started working in an office that’s high stress and tense most of the time. (I really needed the money)

This type of environment puts a lot of stress on me and I don’t really know how to take their tense and aggressive energy and not be offended or cowardly towards them.

84,trying to be a happy adult,"As a quick question, what do you guys do to cope with bpd or heal from traumas? Especially without a therapist or medication 

I actually had therapy and meds since I was 13/14 years old, till I was 20 last year I stopped using my parents insurance because I completely distanced myself from my family and honestly everyone all my friends from the past because they all just were shit to me. 

After I left rehab when I was 17, I still had my bpd symptoms but I experienced a weird like 2 years just not feeling real. I don't remember much of that but I just really dissociated all the time. 

I started having friends again, smoking more heavily, did risky things more than ever. I even tried almost not even wanting to think about the past, I wanted to reconnect with my family a bit. But pretty much every single of those people ended up really hurting me. There's so much that was happening. My life honestly felt like hell to me, and it hurt my soul that growing up I've always thought about how the hurt seems to only get worse and worse. And here I am wanting to just be okay, start living independently. But my family doesn't give a fuck to admit their mistakes, these friends are all fake, people think I'm weird. I still get anxiety at work hoping customers don't notice or say anything about my arms covered in scars. 

But I'm so tired of suffering from my past wounds I want to just get rid of but why does the pain stay? I know I'll have to struggle with my mental illness, and just try to maintain it. I barely managed to get an insurance but so far it hasn't helped, I hate when these things list places that don't accept them!

Can someone please share me what the first steps are towards making better coping mechanisms? I am so lost, and I don't know any people who have BPD too. I just want to cognitively and emotionally have a better response to feeling stressed or overwhelmed instead of doing to same things over and over again that hurt me.

86,So Stuck RN,"I have had periods of being very well emotionally regulated, mostly when I am modeling good behaviors/actions for others. What ultimately happens is I am so focused on others that I forget to tend to myself. I’ve had a few bottoms. One came during the plague with social isolation. I then got a WFH job and social engagements got super hard for me. Looking back I can almost see my self completely unwind. Stop going to gym, stop journaling, stop meditating, stopped taking showers, changing clothes, brushing teeth, then stopped taking my medications bc if I take the ADHD meds I feel locked inside my head and almost paralyzed on the outside. By this time my head had 8 different trains of thought on 6 tracks and at least one wants me to unsubscribe from life and they constantly whirl around up there. I asked for accommodations from my company and they then found a reason to fire me (Top sales rep, most customer compliments) and I tail spun. 

So I swore I would unsubscribe from life before giving up my 325ft studio apartment (bc it was mine and I paid for it all by myself) and move back in with my parents. Soooo…..my brother let me crash with him. My head was so dark and so mean to me that getting out of bed seemed impossible. Sublet the studio to someone who is trashing it and also wants to sleep with me. (Uggggg)

So now, I have done EMDR, ART, DBT, CBT and I’m therapy and have a psych and I’m still in this rut where I JUST DONT CARE ABOUT MYSELF AT ALL ANYMORE. It’s like the spark or fire went out. I can’t seem to find it. Brother was paying for top tier therapy and now it’s been downgraded to better help. He’s upset he’s not getting a return on investment bc I haven’t been able to be more regulated for the last 2 years. 

I’ve gained over 100lbs in 2 years thanks to gastroparesis from Weygovi/Ozempic/Rybelsus. 

I now have a bedroom that I operate out of and while my brother can be super encouraging and supportive, lately I only hear what I’m doing bad/wrong.

Now dad has had heart issues, step sis going thru divorce from a narcissist - she has two kids 4/9 and she’s a flight attendant with her own Truman’s manifesting in such dysfunction rn. (Which is effecting the kids)

I can show up for my dad and step sis and my niece and nephew and lately, I put the very disassociated mask on where I’m modeling good behaviors, showering, changing clothes, doing laundry, doing sisters dishes and laundry and going to doctor appointments. Did I make my psych appt this month…nope. Dad in hospital. 

When those duties/obligations end…..I deflate back into a dark hole who doesn’t really care if I see tomorrow. 

2018-2022 I racked up over 30k in debt, so there’s a bankruptcy that gets to happen, and I’ve asked multiple people to be my body double so I can sit down and get the information I need so I can file it. Currently, if I go back to work, one of my more aggressive lenders will get a judgement and garnish my wages. It’s so traumatizing for me that I did this to myself that I don’t feel safe doing it alone. 

I filed for disability bc it’s actually proving that me acting as the Geico duck in the boat plugging all the multiple holes (my family’s needs) is enough to be a full time job and I have adhd, ptsd, BPD, anxiety, agoraphobia, social anxiety. I don’t have clothes that fit. So I have mostly pajamas. I hate going in public and won’t do social things. And I’m so dysregulated rn that I couldn’t imagine working part or full time doing anything. 

I don’t know how or when we crossed that tipping line of full heartedly believing that my life is worthless. I don’t matter, I don’t want to be here, and have made certain promises to not do the thing I really want to do while parents are alive, or in family’s house. (This is one area where black and white thinking is helping me.) I care more about NOT inflicting trauma on my family than I care about myself.

I very much wish that I felt/believed/desired like I was capable of going back to giving a fuck, and taking my meds, and showering and looking forward to working out, wanting to be social, enjoying life rather than I have XYZ task that drains my batteries and takes all my spoons so now I need 4 days to recharge. It’s exhausting. 

I cannot seem to create and keep a routine bc nothing is routine. I’m pulled to take care of the kids or dad has new appts nearly every week. I’ve lost enjoyment and fulfillment in the things that used to make me happy like painting or singing. 

Everything hurts, every muscle aches. I don’t feel like stretching helps.

I find that I am seeing or aware of every flaw of my body and limitations since gaining all this weight. I could go on and on.

I’m getting frustrated at my limitations and when the frustration hits I’m not able to positively spin it to find a way to overcome it, the frustration is too loud and draining and before I can even acknowledge it and catch it to try to reframe it, my batteries are dead. 

I don’t know where to start or what to do first. I assume it’s one little thing to the next. I just don’t know how to do it when i genuinely don’t want to be here and don’t care. I am truly stuck. Like stuck stuck. 

Anyone with any experience with this apathy and stuckness, I’d really like some help from people who have been where i am and found a way to care again.

I live in the US and our mental health resources are limited and sorely underfunded and my family doesn’t have the resources to put me in a nice place for 90 days that would force me to have a routine.

87,"BPD, CPTSD, Bipolar 2","Sorry for this long rant, trying to make sense of my broken life and needed to share with others who might be more understanding about what I’m going through, with my mental illness.

How do you find yourself again after being so lost? Grasping for hope, I want to change my life. Tired of living this low life. My boyfriend and I broke up 9 months ago, he was my FP. I did a lot to damage our relationship and engaged in a lot of self sabotaging. He’s at fault too, for things in the relationship. We broke up I slept with someone and got pregnant. Sadly I’ve been dealing with a lot of guilt and shame about the situation. I want so badly to reconnect and reconcile our broken relationship. I’ve been in an incredibly lonely and depressed state. I miss the good parts of our relationship and certainly do not want to go back to the dysfunctional state our relationship ended up being. Throughout the relationship I self medicated and numbed my feelings with weed and alcohol, I let it cloud everything. With being pregnant I’ve become sober, and I’m trying to deal and correct my behaviors. I’ve been seeing the psychiatrist to get a proper diagnosis and a treatment plan, seeking out therapy. I heavily rely on others to make me feel whole, or I just isolate until it’s absolutely crippling. I’m 7 months pregnant now and I’m confused by everything, baby daddy isn’t involved and is toxic and probably just as unstable as I am….but I’m doing all things to prepare for the twins. I don’t know if I’m grasping for straws with my ex to fill the void I’m feeling. I’ve done a lot of splitting towards him and caused a lot of unnecessary turmoi. I’m bipolar 2, suffer from CPTSD and BPD. I also am already a single mother to a 12 year old who is extremely fond of my ex. His father isn’t involved in his life and the closest thing he has had to a fatherly figure is my ex. We both miss him greatly. What is your honest take/opinion on my situation, is there hope for us? Or should I just pick up the broken pieces, let go and move forward? My ex has been incredibly patient with me and my Illness but I stayed stuck in denial that I needed help. But being clear headed I see more clearly. Since finding out I was pregnant my ex has expressed that he wants to be there and father my twins, but I’m afraid I’m too late. He moved across the state to be with another woman but at the same time I know I’d he felt it was worth it he would drop everything to be with me….. we both have mad love for each other but so afraid that things can’t and won’t get better, but also hope that things can change and growth will come, despite our setbacks.",1688445912.0,False,1,0,Old-Meet-1322,None,14q52w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/14q52w4/bpd_cptsd_bipolar_2/

91,Impulsive behavior triggered by feelings of inadequacy and abandonment,"I'm just so messed up. I kinda need to rant right now because I'm feeling like a piece of shit. I like people but I push them away. I even love people but I push them away. I really like someone special and I keep pushing them away. I am not feeling appreciated enough and I don't think they're interested in me the same way as they were before. It's all very confusing to me. I've known them for almost a month. I think. And of course my feelings quickly went from ""hm, I don't trust you"" to ""I want to spend the rest of my life with you"" and now to ""I hate you so much it hurts my soul"".

I'm exhausted. I hate feeling like this. I'm in therapy. I'm taking my medication. I'm cutting off harmful people. I'm trying my best at creating a better life for myself. I'm sleeping well. Eating fairly well. But I'm stuck. Stuck in this fear of never finding someone who won't leave me. But with this fear comes me being overbearing, annoying, needy. Which leads to me being abandoned either way since I let my addiction show. Yes, I guess I get addicted to people I love. And/or like a lot. Maybe it's not the end of the world to feel that way if you don't act on it. But I do.

I'm destroying this new relationship now, stripping it away piece by piece. All the love and care will disappear. My hate will overtake and then loneliness will show it's ugly face again.

I did a lot of work to just a healthier version of myself and stop using my own failure to spite my family--I got on medication, exercised, went to a DBT group for 6 months etc. I was going to uni and doing exceptionally well but when covid hit I was kicked out of my dorm and had to come back home.

Home is already triggering for me and slowly but surely my old patterns came back. Here's my issue: I WANT to do better by exercising, eating well, being connected and what not but for some reason I do NOT want my mom to see this.

I feel like she is constantly watching me and calculating my behavior. I can sometimes be paranoid but I do know that when she most actively cares for me is when I am at my worst. I do NOT want that kind of attention right now, but I'm having such a hard time just taking care of myself while she is around.

93,Advice on how to help a significant other with BPD,"Hello everyone,

I decided to go to reddit on this particular topic. I know everyone is different and it won’t exactly be the same, but I am trying to be a very supportive gf for my bf who struggles with BPD. He’s been diagnosed early on, does not take any medication for it either. It’s his choice, and I’m not against that at all. Why I’m here is because I personally don’t have BPD or am really close with anyone who has it other than him. I don’t really know how to help or be supportive for him. It’s been really really hard for him lately. He’s been struggling very very hard with his self image. As well as doing compulsive harmful acts. His stress levels have been so high. In terms of the stress, I’ve been trying to give him massages, and cute things like that to help him just relax. Sometimes though, I don’t know what to do when he’s angry about something you wouldn’t really expect. He’ll give a lot of emotion. When he calms down he apologizes. I just want to know what I can do, to help him more or be here for him. I love him so much and don’t want to see him suffering. I don’t want him to feel like he’s alone, and that all he has is himself always. I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. Just let me know and I will delete and search on further.

94,"Does anyone else feel like their past actions inhibit themselves from ever being a good person? (tw// hyper sexuality, sa)","Let me explain. In the past before DBT and medication  (about 2 years ago) I was a very hyper sexual person. I would hook up constantly, and would behave in manipulative ways to have my partners stay with me because I hated being alone. I feel as though my actions in the past were not as consensual as I thought they were, and it makes me want to disappear any time I think about it. To clarify, I have never forced myself onto someone or ignored someone saying “no”, but I know that I have behaved sexually manipulative in the past and acted based on what I assumed my partners wanted instead of asking them. I hate this about myself. I realize that this behaviour was inexcusable and I have not been able to be intimate with anyone in over a year, because I feel so much shame and guilt for how I have behaved and want to avoid sex altogether. I first confessed these feelings to my psychiatrist who reassured me that this was common especially amidst the metoo movement and whatnot, but I still feel crushed by this. I no longer have the sense of hyper sexuality I had in the past. If anything I feel completely turned off by the thought of having sex with someone. I want to be a good person. I want to be able to say that I am a good person but I feel like I will never be able to atone for my past or that I am irredeemable as a person because I have potentially hurt people in the past. No one ever said anything to me but I know now that I was behaving in a way that had potential to hurt people. Has anyone else ever felt this way?

FP: I think there’s more context to that
 And I wish you would’ve just talked to me about it.

Me: Well I thought u didn’t want me there so I didn’t think to text u.

FP: We were stopping by quick and I wanted to leave and we only stayed because Abby was coming to pick Brooke up and I do like hanging out with you I didn’t tell anyone to ignore you.I think recently everytime we hang out though you end up getting mad at me and I get so confused and I was just frustrated that day and I’m sorry.

Me: I’m sorry I guess I’m an frustrating person to be around I don’t want to make u feel like that I don’t mean to do it on perpouse 
I don’t want u to think I’m a toxic person bc I’m getting that vibe.

FP: I don’t think you’re toxic and I don’t think you’re a frustrating person to be around at all. I just sometimes get confused what I did wrong or how I can help like if we are joking around and then you get mad at me I just don’t know what to do

I feel like a bad friend 

Me:

Bc of when I get in a bad mood.I don’t mean to always make u feel bad everytime we hang out.

FP: That’s not true 
Don’t feel that way please.
In those moment I just want to help because I care about you and want to understand what’s wrong you know.

Me:  Ok I have been trying really hard to change bc ik that if i keep acting like that ppl won’t like me.

Me: Ok good I’m really glad we had this conversation bc I really love you I don’t want to loose u bc ur one of the coolest pepeople I know and I don’t want u to ever think I DOTN like u when I am distant bc I’m just trying to stop myself from making me say something that I will regret 
Sometimes when I don’t take my medication I act abnormal.

FP: I understand

I’m never really truly mad at you 
If it looks like I anger it’s really just hurt in a way and I want things to be okay .

Me: Okay and I should probably go back to thearpy to fix myself 

FP: You don’t need to be fixed. 
That isn’t what I want you to feel like.

Me: No I do bc I’m immature and don’t take care of my mental disorder like I should and it will come crashing down on me
 thought u we’re never gonna like me again and I just panicked I’m really sorry
I won’t do it again

FP: no of course not

Me: ok good.

96,"I am ADHD, he is BPD (EUPD)","Long time lurker, first time poster.

So, ADHD is predominately diagnosed as a male condition but I am an adult, 32 year old woman, diagnosed with full spectrum ADHD! Whoop whoop! Energy for days! Bipolar Disorder (BPD/EUPD) is mainly diagnosed in women. However, my ex partner, 33 year old guy, has been diagnosed as EUPD. He feels everything! No matter how much I google I can’t seem to find any other couples that have had this dynamic. So, dear redditors, I call upon you to help me figure out whether or not this could be a healthy partnership should we both learn to appreciate the other?

We broke up in September 2019 due to financial problems and discovering he had addictions. So, that’s where the money went?!?! His behaviour became aggressive and me not fully grasping socially awkward situations probably aggravated him. No excuse for his behaviour, but equally I am extremely difficult to live with. Before September we were what I call the perfect couple. Holidaying with the kids, supportive of each other’s careers and he was extremely caring when it came to my ADHD (he was not diagnosed till after the relationship ended). Plus our sex life was out of this world!!! Like seriously, it was like a drug itself, being as it appears both impulsive in nature. 

So, we broke it off after some pretty serious arguments. Great, we can all move on with our lives!?!! Nope!!! Thing is, all that time before was PERFECT! Like I have never experienced! But being the stubborn cow I am I wasn’t about to tell him that. Then he messaged on Christmas and has been messaging a lot since then. Updates on his diagnosis, his medication and how he wants to date again. 

The question is, can an ADHDian and a BPDian have a healthy, happy relationship? And how is there such an attraction between two people with these traits? Please fellow redditors, I need advice!!!",1579294096.0,False,5,3,DianaPrinceTheOrigin,None,eq688o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/eq688o/i_am_adhd_he_is_bpd_eupd/
97,Not sure how to navigate,"This is my first time posting in here, kinda nervous ngl. Sorry in advance that this is so long..

I (f28) met my person (f23) almost a year & a half ago. I’m diagnosed & unmedicated severe BPD for the past 6ish years. When we first met, we both communicated very well about how we were & what we feel our ups/downs are. About 6mos in, I started having symptoms of a BPD split bc of a situation in which I attempted to let her in on my grief (something I guard ferociously) & it wasn’t perceived. At that time, it seemed as if she didn’t care about me the way I’d been believing she did up until then. That initiated my split & to be completely honest, I cannot even begin to list or explain the things that I was feeling. I just was feeling as though she was completely against me & didn’t understand why she stayed around. I was drowning in the moment that caused the split & got stuck in that spiral. While she, on the other hand, was pushing & pushing for me to meet her needs in the present moments. (Theres things & moments that I’m leaving out for the sake of trying not to make this post way longer). In December (2 days before her birthday), I was told something that was along the lines of her cheating on me that dated back to the summer. This set me off even more & when I brought it to her attention, she seemed as though it wasn’t important enough to take upon herself to rectify. That made me feel like there’s some truth to the information, which I still haven’t been able to let go of. In January she moved out & back with her family in an attempt to put space so we can get better. In my opinion, it was working up until mid-Feb when she came to me about a personal medical situation that threw me for a loop especially seeing how we’d been intimate & I was being made aware of it just over a month after she moved. I was feeling very much so like just as we were going to be able to close the door on one thing, another door of bs opens up. I started feeling overwhelmed again & I didn’t feel like I had any support from her because she was worried about why I wasn’t giving her what she wanted/needed from me in the moment. I tried explaining that I was having a hard time processing everything (I process from the past to the present, not the present to the past so it’s basically like everything in the present is on pause while I go thru the past to identify different things). At the end of February/beginning of March, I reached out to an ex due to the fact that I’d noticed similarities between that relationship & this one that I wanted to correctly identify so I could change it in the present. That led to her & I spending about a week or so together with her spending the nights here. On the day that the ex was leaving, my person came in & saw her standing in my room while I was in bed freshly showered & had just taken my robe off to lay down (so it looked way worse than it was). That led to a long night of me explaining the BPD split, the reason I reached out to my ex in the first place, as well as the lies I’d told to keep it from being found out. I admitted it was super impulsive & I didn’t think at all before doing it, as well as not taking into account how it’d look or be perceived by anyone else. I told her it could be fixed & we could get better but it’d take a lot of work to do so simply bc I’m now in a space where I realize I let my BPD get way out of control. I was in my own shit storm for 8mos at that point & I have a lot of work to do to repair this relationship that’s been broken for about 5 of those 8. The next couple of weeks was kinda hard, there were some uncomfortable conversations but I did my best & explained as much as I could. I started changing my behavior as well. Last week there was a night she’d come over to spend time with me & asked to see the text messages between my ex & I, in which I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that due to the sensitivity of the conversations (they were majorly centered around my grief & my feelings/emotions during the first two years of it prior to the breakup). It’s not that I don’t want her to know now, I just feel like there’s steps that need to be taken before that due to the fact that up until this moment, the only time my grief has been brought up is during an argument about something else. She never asks me about it, and to me it doesn’t make sense to allow her into that part of myself without her ever even trying to talk about it with me. She’s now said to me that she started seeing someone, and is done trying to pressure me to open up to her. I’ve been doing CBT/DBT, as well as the BPD workbook by Dr. Fox all on my own to be able to get better for myself as well as the betterment of our relationship. I’m stuck feeling like I’m not being given a chance to actually open myself completely up to expose myself to the person that I want nothing less than forever with. I texted her this morning asking if we could talk in person because I need to be able to convey this to her. I’m just not sure how to go about it at all - what do I say or not say, what options there are to hold myself to, and more importantly if she can be the support I need to get us on the same page again so we can move forward. Does anyone have any suggestions on what things to touch on and what to leave alone? I really want us to seek couples therapy to bridge the gap that we’ve wedged.

Two hospital visits from that I met a guy who helped me get out of my rut , we lived together for 3 years with his support I finished nursing school and am currently a nurse. I ended up leaving him two years ago and had a streak of extremely unsuccessful relationships with very damaging people with warning signs so bright it took immense denial to stay in them. This last one really did a number on me and now it's over .. He left .. After all that lol. Now I'm trying to get over it, deal with feelings of depression but most of all my extremely deep feelings of loneliness, and insecurity. I've decided I need to start healing myself , started taking zyprexa ( which I have been on and off due to its SE of tiredness and drowsyness) . Zyprexa in particular BC it helps me eat , I have this obsession that if I gain 15 pounds everything will work out. I'm very thin I'm 5'2 90 lbs. I've been chain smoking a pack a day for a month. My issue is tha I'm not enough for myself, as damaging as my relationships had been it took a relationship for me to become motivated and feel better, alone I seem to be incapable but I must try. I came to this group today hoping to find that motivation here to help me stop smoking which btw metabolizes zyprexa faster and I'm

99,Will I ever love myself?,"About 5 years ago I broke! I tried to go to sleep forever! I somehow lost all.ability to cope with my emotions. Though I have always been intense emotionally I was always able to ""function!"" but it became impossible! I was diagnosed with severe  depression and mild anxiety. We have tried every medication under the sun for depression.  About 2 years ago I again couldnt deal with the thought of having one more day! I was diagnosed with having Borderline personality disorder!! Once I actually received this diagnosis everything made sense. I could look back and see that I had this my whole life. I could make sense of feeling outside, I didn't feel so disgusted with myself for they way i used to hurt myself. I felt a glimmer of hope that now the healing can begin we have found the true problem. In these two years I have never been worse. I couldn't except that there was no magical pill to make me an adult again. I have closed off almost all communication from the world. I only leave my house when I have Dr appointments and only if my mother drives me (pretty pathetic) I have a nephew I only met twice and another maybe a handful of times. I have another niece and nephew that had me before I broke and now wonder where there favorite aunty has went. I can't stand to see my family all I see is pain and disappointment. All I see is their distrust that I won't kill myself. So I shut away. I can look in the mirror my view is so dark and distorted. I just want my life back. I have these people trying to help and everyone says the same thing. Only once I love myself can I find out where I belong and what I was meant to be. Only then can o find happiness. But all I have is hopelessness and an extreme hate for myself. I don't hate much I hate rapist and murders and people who hurt children or elders bit nothing is as and as the hate I have for me!! I am finally taking steps to get help. I start a group therapy program this week. I want to be realistic with my goals to avoid disappointing my family and myself once again. So really will I ever love myself? Or is this distorted view here for a lifetime? Can I have BPD and find happiness? Or is hopelessness all I will know?

100,"Need relationship advice, trying to have a healthy relationship but also dealing with BPD symptoms. Can you ever trust your intuition?","A little background on me: I'm a 28 year old female diagnosed BPD about a year ago. Not currently on any medication or undergoing any therapy (cost prohibitive unfortunately) but I am trying to be more aware of my symptoms and deal with them using DBT skills. 

My past romantic relationships have been very tumultuous. I have a lot of issues with self esteem so I tend to hold onto relationships for a lot longer than I should and tolerate a lot of things that I shouldn't (e.g. lack of commitment after long periods, cheating) because I'm trying to avoid being abandoned/prove my self worth. Splitting is also a huge issue for me and I can be very impulsive.

I recently met someone through a dating app and we have been seeing each other for a little over 2 months. We regularly go on dates, he texts me every day, and we talk on the phone frequently. He speaks favorably of our time together, is affectionate in actions and in communication, and we talk regularly about future plans. 

In typical BPD fashion, I got attached very quick but am now constantly looking for a sign that he's going to reject me. I again experience splitting, although I only share these thoughts with the few friends who know about my diagnosis (in other words, I've never lashed out at this person for any perceived slights).

If these things were the end of the story I would just continue to practice DBT skills and try not to react emotionally. However, I decided to do some investigating and he is still on updating/using the dating app where we met. I know that to someone without BPD issues, it was be silly to assume he would have deleted the app only 2 months after meeting me, especially after us having never had a conversation about exclusively dating. However, it's very triggering for me and makes me feel betrayed and rejected. I obsess over it and it causes me a lot of anxiety.

What I'm wanting to know is how to best handle this situation. Do I bring up the idea of exclusively dating? Do I  try to let the relationship play out organically and do my best to control my behaviors like I do in other aspects of my life?",1461308331.0,False,6,2,bpdanon88,None,4fxclm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/4fxclm/need_relationship_advice_trying_to_have_a_healthy/
101,I need help,"Hello everyone,

I'm reaching out for help because my BPD is lately becoming more severe (I had a relatively calm period for a year). I see a therapist and a trained social worker once a week for some time already, I'm also on quite high dosage of psychiatric medication at the moment (to the point it negatively affects my performance).

There are huge improvements on my ability to handle intense emotions, lately however, they grew to the point I'm worn-out and they've become too strong for me to cope with. I seek help but it doesn't make me better for long. On Monday, I'll have an appointment with my psychiatrist and I consider getting sectioned. 

The reason to it is my relationship. We've been together for 16 months and now I found out that his perhaps closest friend I know personally, is a girl he once had feelings for before we started dating and supposingly stopped as we'd become a couple. I knew about it and asked about it during our relationship, however he said it was someone I've never met and he doesn't talk to anymore. 

I know he loves me, he deals with my BPD that causes him a lot of stress and we talked it all through several times. I just can't stop feeling betrayed by the lie, no matter how much I rationalise. It took me so long to develop trust to him but now it's all broken. He's willing to break the friendship, he agreed on followings my boundaries that now I've decided to set. 

It's not the only time he would lie to me, when it comes to his female friends. He knows how it worries me. I don't have any proof or reason to think he'd cheat. It's also that lately I've come to realise how hard I try and push myself in the relationship and I see in many ways he doesn't appreciate it enouch and doesn't really try himself. Now he's promised he's going to change it when I told him how I feel. 

My emotions just won't stop being too extreme, my mood swings unpredictably and rapidly, I feel hurt and betrayed and I don't know how to cope with my feelings. For a few hours I feel it's not that bad, that it's my fault and it feels as if I could easily solve it, then I go extremely down as see my boyfriend as he were Judas and overthink without being able to put myself in ease anyhow. 

Please, I need to talk to someone who struggles with BPD too and can relate to those extreme, improper to the situation emotions. Please, I want to know what others do to make it bearable, to handle it without damaging the relationship or getting admitted to the mental clinic (as it happened to me many times). I consider sectioning as the last option.",1556209652.0,False,3,1,Ironical80slut,None,bhanhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/bhanhn/i_need_help/
102,I don't know why I have BPD,"this is very long and i dont expect anyone to read it, its basically a breakdown of my life and how i went from a good little christian kid to whatever the fuck is going on with my life now
my bpd confuses me. I've always joked that I've was born with a broken heart because during my childhood, I can't really remember anything traumatic happening to me and I had a good home life, yet I loved sad music and I remember being very young, like 3-4 and praying to God (I was just raised religious and I am a trans man and those things did not mix well even though I didn't realize my gender identity was the cause of a lot of unrecognized dysphoria that I thought was just due to the fact that I was chubby until I was a Junior in high school) to take me to heaven now whenever I got yelled at. In middle school I always felt left out and inadequate. In high school, I was not popular and was never once pursued romantically or had reciprocated feelings for any of my classmates. And although I wasn't bullied, my roommate (religious boarding school)freshman often snuck out of our room to go hang out with our other friend and I remember spending nights crying and wondering why I wasn't enough for her. I started experiencing depressive episodes during the winter and during my sophomore year I tried to seek help because it wasn't going away during the spring this time and was met with a ""you seem fine you've got that real Jesus joy in your heart"". and then junior year I went into a depressive episode that hasn't really seemed to lift completely to this day. I cut myself daily and isolated myself a lot and started gaining weight, something that I hated because I was already overweight and hated my body. I remember praying and crying and wondering why I was feeling like this and why this was happening to me. I viewed myself as lazy, worthless, unloveable, and a complete failure at the ripe age of 17. I lost my faith, my ambitions, everything. I also realized that I was bisexual and trans and this further worsened the depression because I knew my parents would not approve. I was hiding everything from them and trying to hold myself together and ""cure"" myself by using a horrible system of cutting myself for not completing chores/homework that I needed to complete but had 0 motivation or energy to do. I wanted to take my life, but before I could work up the nerve to I opened up to my parents about how I was feeling about everything about the LGBT stuff. they got me an online Christian counselor who helped but I was still dealing with the LGBT aspects of my issues because I was afraid of being kicked out of my school or being sent to conversion therapy. I knew I couldn't deny these aspects of my identity because I knew they were things that I couldn't change, the problem was that every single person in my life was, although most not aggressively, homophobic and transphobic. I saw a light of sorts at the end of the tunnel at graduation, and I figured if I could just make it out of high school and shatter the glass ceiling on my current life, then everything would be better. Senior year I took Lexapro and it didn't really seem to help, but I continued to take it. Unfortunately I gained more weight because of binge eating and was around 240lbs, not that much but I was easily one of the largest people in my school. I had an online girlfriend who told me she loved me and then later said she never meant it when we broke up. I started smoking cigarettes and weed and spent a lot of my time alone because half of the time when I tried to hang out with anyone I felt like I didn't really belong. I felt like a lot like I was on the outside of my own life and looking in. At this point I was also very bad and still am at taking care of myself, which I am very embarrassed about and am working on. I didn't shower as much as I should, I woke up with only 5 minutes to get to class, and really just kind of blundered through life because I was using all my energy on just keeping myself alive. Finally, I graduated, and things looked like they were getting better. I came out to my parents, and my previous good relationship with them tanked. things were weird, they acted like I was this whole new person but I still felt like I was just me. This hurt because of the obvious disapproval of the true me, in identity and opinions and personal values. this is still a source of contention with my dad mostly but I've learned to just tolerate his unacceptance of my gender identity. I felt alone and ostracized in my own house and college was the way I finally began to branch out into the real world. I met my best friend, began smoking weed daily which I think has proven mostly beneficial to me but I will not deny this may be problematic as well. I hung out with my new friend and then her friends who have become most of my current social circle daily and was never in the house. I took a break from college which turned into dropping out because I was changing career paths and found my passion in dog grooming, which was great. as I worked and had money to spend though, problems began arising. at this point I had started to feel somewhat out of control of myself, staying up too late before working in the morning, starting to do party drugs occasionally like Ecstasy, ect. while at home feeling like I was stuck in the past. I noticed that when I was out with my friends and living my own life, I was happy and although erratic and overly sensitive to feeling the need to belong and be inlcluded in everything, but as soon as i stepped foot through the door of my house i could feel my mood start to tank. I only even slept on nights when i worked in the morning. I felt the need to be able to do everything with my new friends and keep up, and i deeply needed them to like me. I was still unhappy with my weight, although beginning to like my appearance as i was able to present as my true gender. I am a hopeless romantic and have always wanted to settle down and get married. I had a lot of trouble finding love and felt unnattractive and undesirable. I also spent my money impulsively and was often broke and struggled to make it through a week on a part time paycheck. Because i spent so much time away from home and didn't have much money, I often skipped meals in favor of a pack of cigs or whatever random thing i was focused on. Because i was eating less and stiffled my appetite with cigarettes, i started to notice a loss of weight. I have never been athletic and especially now since i ran myself ragged constantly socializing or working, I've never consistently worked out or really seen any weight loss. So I started to skip meals on purpose occasionally and not just to save money. I desperately wanted to be skinny, something I've never been. It didnt get to be a problem until later when i really started to drop weight. First though, in late 2018 I met my current boyfriend and although it's only been about a year and a half, I'm certain he's the love of my life, and he feels the same. However, with all good things there are problems. He had a rough childhood and because of it has a lot of very difficult mental problems himself. At this point, i had stopped taking my meds after beginning walbutrin to combat how dull lexapro made me feel emotionally at times. I didnt like how irritable it made me and i barely remembered to take my meds anyways, and i was feeling elated with a new relationship and thought it was a good idea. i don't regret it because although i spiralled into a depression enough to admit myself to a hospital for a short while. They diagnosed me with bipolar 2 which didnt really seem to fit right since the hospital seemed to diagnose everyone with some kind of bipolar disorder and gave everyone abilify, the worst medication i have ever taken. Meanwhile, my boyfriend, B, was going through one of the worst mental health years of his life, and I tried to support him the best that I could. I definitely tended to ignore my own needs to help his objectively much more serious issues. I was also doing more drugs and just got a promotion from bather to groomer and had to transfer to a new store. I was very close to my coworkers at my first store but i didnt fit in with the other salon workers at the new location. I was feeling very out of touch with my social circle and extremely stressed out. Then one day, B had a very bad dissociative episode and didn't recognize me. I felt completely useless and pointless, especially since that morning I had also slept through my alarm for work; again. I remeber bursting into tears before getting my best friend, who i now lived with, to comfort B because I all I could think to do run. I then left the house and got into my car fall apart. I noticed Bs nightmare medication and zoloft, and without a second thought downed the entire bottle of prazosin and drove to a park. I then swallowed a handful of zoloft for good measure before i got a call from my best friend. When i got back to the house (god knows how i didnt wreck my car because i was definitely starting to feel the effects) They knew what was up immediately and then I was hospitalized for a second time, only a month after the first visit. Before my first hospital visit, I discovered one of my worst vices: cocaine. While i enjoyed other drugs, not counting weed, I didn't really care to seek them out on my own. But i fell in love with coke. i loved the way it made me feel physically, and finally the persistent exhaustion of being alive lifted and i felt like i could actually focus on something long enough to accomplish it. I was a nasty habit that gave me panic attacks, made me somehow even broker, and by the end of it I had gone from 240lbs to 160lbs since it made not eating even easier. I was also even more tired and irritated constantly. Thankfully my best friend had dealt with an eating disorder in highschool and called me out and helped me start eating better again. And then B and I tried meth. It was amazing, but it was also the fucking worst. We only did it twice, and the first time I personally only had a long, irritating comedown, but B dissociated so hard he thought he was 16 again for 3 days. The next time we did it i started to see things and have panic attacks at the thought of having to go to work in the morning. I called into work and that day we broke up because I wanted to get clean and he didn't. The next day we talked when we were clear headed we got back together, him now ready to quit too. I'm incredibly lucky that we got out when we did from meth because it would have destroyed us. Its something i still fear that I'll relapse into again, even though i dont really miss it except when I'm feeling especially dead inside. I told my mom about my drug use and this prompted a visit to a new psychiatrist who diagnosed me with BPD. It's nice to finally find a diagnosis that seemed to actually fit. I'm doing better right now, relatively. I found a medication that actually works, thank god for trileptal, B and I are mostly sober, the hardest thing we do now is acid every now and then, and we still smoke, just probably too much now. I've started DBT but had to stop because i got a new job and it didn't fit into my schedule, but now im on job number 3 of 2020 and its much more loosely scheduled so i can actually focus on my mental health for once in my life.
Anyways, the question I wanted to ask is I don't understand still why I have BPD. Everyone talks about how childhood trauama can ""cause"" it, and I know depression runs in the family, but not BPD. I come from a stable home where I was loved, although not really accepted but that wasn't until later on after my mental health started tanking. I feel guilty about it, and I can't help but think that I took a start for a good life and just shit all over it. I feel like such a family disappointment and I feel like im going to be stuck on this random, emotional rollercoaster forever and I'll just continue to destroy every good thing in my life. If i could pinpoint it to anything, I would think my roommate in freshman year sneaking out of our room might have been the start of the extreme fear of abandonment, but that seems like such a stupid, not traumatic or abusive at all thing to have caused me to go from who I was before, someone i can barely even remember what they were even like in terms of personality, to the dumpster fire ive become. Maybe theres some repressed memory of something happening to me, because I get asked if I was ever sexually assualted a lot, but I have no memory of anything like that ever happening and while I don't have a problem having sex mentally my body just doesn't seem to react that well to anyone other than myself. Maybe my brain chemistry is just that fucked that sometime as simple as a friend hanging out with someone else sometimes set it off. I just want to get to the root of the issue, any insight or if y'all also just want to spill your entire life story onto the internet feel free and I'll listen to you. Take care guys
tldr: I dont remember any trauma or abuse during childhood that would spark the BPD and I fear I may have some repressed memory or something, and I want to know why I have BPD so i can get better.",1589249403.0,False,4,6,dickfag69420,None,gi1w9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/gi1w9f/i_dont_know_why_i_have_bpd/
103,help?,"i know you guys aren’t qualified to diagnose me. but from your experience of living with bpd, could you please tell me if i’d meet the criteria for a diagnosis as i list my experiences and examples with the criteria standards. 

i also want to point out that i am currently isolated because i feel more comfortable within myself when i don’t have people in my life. 

1. Consistent feelings of emptiness- i don’t feel like a human being, i feel like an alien who is just existing most of the time. there is a sense of just feeling numb and nothing almost. if i could explain it, it just feels like there is a black hole inside of me and i don’t feel anything. 

2. Persistent and unstable self-image
i have never known who i am because of how often my mind changes. sometimes if i make up my mind about something, but i see someone arguing against my opinion, i’ll kind of rethink my opinion and side with them and tell myself i was wrong and they’re right. i feel like all i am is components of people’s personality and styles that i’ve stolen. for example, my career choices change a lot and very drastically. one minute i want to go into law and the next i see someone who works in the medical field and i begin to research the steps i’d need to take in order to do the same job as them. mind you, this would be a person online who i don’t even know, but i just like their content and i want their life. i also struggle with my own dress styles, for example; my ex had a sister who wore a lot of jewellery, so i went and bought the same jewellery and eventually adopted the same style as her, i would copy her music tastes and listen to the artists i knew she listened to and i could never understand why i did this. but since reading about bpd, i have acknowledged that i struggle have no sense of self. I will also mimick characters and their traits after watching a show, for example, i started to watch killing eve and then i would speak in a russian accent like Villanelle. I mimick Lorelai Gilmore a lot in terms of her humour and talking pace. 

3. Intensely unstable relationships
this is the first time i’ve been alone. i hate feeling lonely but love to be alone nowadays. i have been dating since 13 and i’ve been totally single with no male attention for almost a year. every relationship has been chaotic and i’ve been described as ‘unpredictable’ because my moods do not stay the same rarely ever, especially in romantic relationships, in terms of the constant arguments, being totally unable to believe what people say and trusting them, constant breakups, paranoid and anxious thoughts, such as believing they are cheating on me. i even go as far as stalking their social media accounts and creating a false story in my head about my partner and someone who they have on social media, and of course i believe the story although i don’t really have strong evidence to prove my case, and my behaviour shifts completely, i go from talking normally to my partner to being blunt and sarcastic which causes an argument. i also struggle with how i think about my partner and in all of my relationships, i have often ‘fallen in love’and felt like a happy little child with them, and feeling like this is a fairytale kind of love, to randomly hating them and wanting nothing to do with them. and the cycle continues. 

4. Repetitive suicidal thoughts, threats, gestures, or behaviors
i have always been attached to suicide. it never leaves my mind. i’ve been this way for so long. i constantly have the thought of killing
myself in my mind, but i do not want to die. i catch myself saying ‘i wanna die’ all the time and most times its for a silly reason, like me dropping my drink and it spilling everywhere. i have come close to suicide only twice. the first one i couldn’t find any pills to OD on, and the second time it was as if my reality became distorted. i had just finished arguing with my partner and was extremely upset by it and everything stopped and felt like a movie as i stepped past the yellow warning line near the train tracks. and suddenly it was as if everyone’s voice came swooning back in and it felt like i was back into reality. its not like i want to die, but i do at the same time. i plan my suicide and think about executing it at least twice a day. 

5. Energetic effort to avoid abandonment (imaginary or real)
in relationships yes. i have always tried to catch my partner out ‘cheating’ (ie. stalking their social media frequently checking for potential girls they could be speaking too and then piecing together a story that seems factual) so i can anticipate and prepare ahead. I have begged partners to stay, even if they’ve cheated, because i don’t want them to leave and i’d rather be in pain with them than without them. I continued to go back to my abuser because the thought of not having him broke my heart because i didn’t know who i was without him or what my life would be like. i have even let my abuser sexually assault me out of fear that he’d leave. i have stood in front of door ways to enable my partner to leave after telling him i wanted him to go, but i didn’t really want him to. 

6. Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling temperament
my anger has always been bad. i was an angry child and i was kicked out of school for fighting. now that im isolated, i don’t get angry a lot. i just struggle with the irritable feelings and anything can irritate me so fast, like the sound of people breathing or chewing sounds. sometimes when i hear my family speak i just get super irritated and can feel my body temp raising. 
in relationships, when something they do or say triggers me i get angry and i say things i don’t mean, throw things at them, and have tried to fight and had to be restrained. but attempts to fight is a rare occurrence. when i failed one of my exams, i was very upset and angry about it and i started to say things very irrational, i wouldn’t like to repeat what i said because i am still feeling guilty about it 

7. Sudden mood swings and emotional instability that can last hours or days
i’m very emotional and unpredictable. i will be in a pool of my own tears and ill cry for hours for no reason and then after i just won’t feel anything, but as soon as i see my siblings, i feel okay and somewhat happy? 
in relationships, i would be out with a partner feeling happy and suddenly i was irritated and just wanted to go home and not see them again. 
in relationships, i have found that i have had many conversations with a partner, normal conversations where i would basically treat them better than royalty and would do absolutely anything for them to suddenly feeling as if id be better off without them and how they don’t deserve me and i hate them and never want anything to do with them again, eventually to snapping out of it and feeling like i love them again.
 i was in college and had a meltdown in the bathrooms because i didn’t feel like i fit in. throughout college, i would just get outbursts where i had to cry uncontrollably, but afterwards i would feel okay. 
i find it quite hard to pin point my emotions so i guess i should start keeping a mood journal? 

8. Severe dissociative symptoms and paranoid delusions related to temporary stressors
When stressed, i isolate and withdraw from life itself. i dont attend education, dont speak to anyone and dont eat because i am too overwhelmed with the stress to deal with people. i just sleep. but when i am stressed and attempt to go outside, it is chaos. i just want to die and everyone that even looks at me i believe is going to follow me or harm me so i must move away otherwise its going to happen. my latest stress was caused by me spending money and not having enough to pay for the things that really matter, so i became stressed and tried to attend uni to ‘get some air’ but i didn’t attend my lectures i just sat in my toilets and cried for an hour and found myself in the middle of london walking around like a lost child. i do not remember how i got there. i just was. 
and when stressed and anxious about things like my cats, i feel the need to stay up all night monitoring my cats because i felt something was wrong with them so i had to be awake ‘just incase.’ i slept when i knew other members in my home were awake. 
when im stressed or upset and im outside, i feel like nothing is real and im almost unaware of my surroundings, and id just stare into thin air. people have seen me do this before and have told me it was as if i wasn’t present.   

9. At least 2 impulsive behaviors (for example: reckless driving, overeating, overspending, substance abuse, or sex)
Only overspending. 

I have been experiencing all of this since i was around 14/15. I am 20 now. 

For those who have this disorder, could you please help me because i am confused and don’t know whether i would qualify for a diagnosis or if it is just depression and unhealed trauma. I am planning on booking a doctors appointment soon 
but i am currently trying to battle the nerves because my mind is telling me im probably making it all up.",1710762488.0,False,2,2,Previous_Ad_7926,None,1bhorrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bhorrm/help/
104,"Friend(25M) of my flatmate(27M and me(24F) keeps making advances and suggestions at being sexual with me, I came close to kicking him out several times.","OK so this weekend was Friend's chance to show that he could behave himself and he totally fucked up.

**Tl:dr - male friend going through relationship issues, alongside potential sex addiction, tries to make out with me/get sexual/convince me to follow suit giving excuses etc.**

A little history on first time (cliff notes): me, flatmate, Friend and GF have dinner together in my flat. Dinner/chatting/messing around and being silly moves onto some drinking and a game of spin the bottle. Dares started off too extreme and were mostly sexy or sexual in some way so as game progressed, things just got more and more out of control. There was a lot of tension between me and Friend (I admit I find him attractive but him being with GF vastly outweighs any notion of me disrupting that with malicious intent). Tension also between me and GF as we're both also Bi. So everyone was being touchy/cuddly with everyone. 
*important note to remember* ALL NIGHT at any time something sexual occurred between Friend or GF with either me or flatmate, consent was ALWAYS asked for and given before amything went ahead and if anyone didn't agree or feel comfortable, the idea was changed to suit.

Flatmate gets tired so me, Friend and GF go back to their house so as not to disturb the rest of the night. Back to their's, all still drunk and on some MDMA at this point. They both start on speed once at their house, whilst continuing to drink, I start to slow down, mainly smoking weed and having drinks more slowly, enjoying the night rounding off. Friend keeps being sexual and kissing me whenever GF isn't in the room, telling me to initiate/convince GF into a 3some. She seems to give consent for Friend to go ahead with me but doesn't want to get into things, becomes very off, wanders off, sees a couple of things me and Friend did at some point. I notice that she had disappeared to the bathroom roughly 20mins ago after saying she was going to the loo once returning from a walk. I go to check on her, discover her on bathroom floor, blood everywhere and slice across her wrist/hand.

Not seen spoken to either since getting dropped home after helping Friend keep her stable until medics arrived, took her to AnE, he followed some time after, not before making FURTHER advances on me after maybe 2 hours of his GF slicing her arm because he craves physical comfort and validation and his instinct is to get it sexually. Because of a history and mental health struggles of her own (obvs), GF doesnt have sex with Friend on a majority.

SO, as mentioned, this was his chance to make it right. It had been a weird evening all around, a lot had happened in under 12 hours and he has apologised several times. I was willing to move on. Flatmate had met him and other friends for some drinks, flatmate ended up being assisted home by Friend and someone else (lets call him Guy) so he could start to sober a bit but not have to stop socialising. Everything fine until, as suspected, Friend asks to speak to me privately to give me an update on GF (I am the only one other than couple of their family members that know what she did and all events) and their general relationship. Didnt mind this happening so we went into my room as this is the only place for privacy when guests are over. He starts talking, apologises again for our last interaction, although still making statements saying how he doesnt regret it, only the consequences that its caused. He goes to give me a hug which I allowed (im cuddly in general with friends), and he tries to kiss me again.

OK shameful confession, I kissed him back for about 1 maybe 2 seconds before pushing him away and telling him that was the last he was every gonna get, trying to play it off jokingly hoping he would leave it there and back off but he holds onto me and tries again and I have to actually push him and firmly tell him no, reminding him that he was in my house. He also asked, when i went to use my bathroom (i have an en suite), if he could watch, and then if he could listen after being told no (We're open when it come to talking about sexual things as a friend group, no kink shaming people). Leading to me running the tap during all other trips to the loo that night. IN MY OWN FLAT. 

Anyway, I made us move into the front room/kitchen to avoid further advances in a shared space. At some point I went to go an put some shorts on so I could show Guy the tattoos I have on my legs and friend took it that I was purposefully showing myself off, taunting him, eliciting looks from me telling him to fuck off. Further down the line all 5 of us were sat on the sofa, arms round each other, having a moment as you do with friends when you've had a drink and its nearing the end, Friends hand found my arm and kept rubbing it behind flatmates head, thankfully he noticed and, being fully aware of the situation, intervened to save me from awkwardly removing myself.

Several times throughout the night and morning I had to threaten him with him with being kicked out, each time he instantly apologises and backs off. I know he isnt an arsehole as a person but every time he gets drunk (and he was blackout drunk but on coke so holding it together and not staggering all over the place) any and all self control and will power he has vanishes. He isnt aggressive or loud, but he gets emotionally vulnerable and will seek out physical comfort and validation anywhere he can find it. Each time he tried something he would be trying to convince me, ""just one come one, i can feel this tension between us"", even went he left, i walked him to the door, he asked for a hug and i said no, i had to grab his hand as he reached to pull me in.

Flatmate works with Friend and has passed on the message that he is no longer allowed in the flat whenever he's had a drink or is on anything else, which he has openly agreed to. Im just so angry at him and I have told him that he needs to pick a day to come over so that I can have it out with him and he can apologise to me. No response, so i asked flatmate this morning to give him a subtle reminder at work today. I am not letting this go.

105,Should I stay in my messy relationship?,"I've been diagnosed with BPD since I was 17 (I'm 24 now) and I've done a lot of different therapies for it. I thought I was getting better for the longest time because I thought I had my emotions and everything under control, especially in relationships. I've been seeing my boyfriend for roughly 2 years and I've noticed I've completely went off the rails. Any sense of emotional stability I've had before has completed disappeared. 2 years ago I was holding down a stable and really good paying job for 3 years and I think they liked me considering they trained me in every department and would always complement my work. I also had lots of friends and was very social, I even had friends that I was friends with for 9 years (there would be a few years in between where we wouldn't talk because of them moving or just different life pathways but always found our way back to each other). I also was in university and bought a car from the dealership and my credit score was really amazing too. I really felt like my life has direction at that point. That was until my dad got his second DUI and went into rehab and came out of rehab doing meth and completely flipping out. That's when I met my boyfriend. It was such a a rough time for me, I had to talk to the cops a lot and get a restraining order against my dad for awhile. My boyfriend was unlike anyone else I dated, he didn't try and force me to have sex and I waited awhile before hooking up with him, and even before we had hooked up he was there to support me through everything! I was so appreciative and really fell in love because I thought he was so compassionate. He had recently went through a break up so I had a sneaking suspicion I was a rebound and I just wanted to know where he and him stood. He promised me I wasn't a rebound and he hadn't talked to his ex for a few months. My BPD started flairing up and I went through his phone (I'm sorry I know it's bad but I developed this bad habit from my last ex being with him for a whole year and trusting him but seeing millions of girls messaging him till I finally had a hunch and checked and was mortified, I just didn't want to waste my time again) I found text messages between his friend and him saying that if he hooked up with me he'd basically be tunnel brothers with all his buddies (which is far from true, he thought I hooked up with both his friends but I only hooked up with his one other friend once when I was blackout at a party and I didn't even really want it to happen) it hurt my feelings to feel like he was talking about me like that to his friends and kinda made me feel like a whore. I ended up flipping and waking him up with a garbage bag full of his stuff and sent him home. We ended up talking it out and we started hanging again. But then whenever he got drunk, he'd call me his ex's name, and he called her and said he loved her and missed her. I was devastated once again, but now I felt like an easy rebound whore. So we once again fought and he convinced me it wasn't that way, just to go and hook up with her the one night I asked for space (he is extremely codependent). I was pissed and tried to convince myself I was done with him. But I'm stupid so I forgave him, I think I only did that because of all the trauma I was going through with my dad, I really wanted someone to be there for me and hold me and tell me everything was okay. He was back at my place again for awhile and then he disappeared to his ex's place for a whole week and swore on his life he didn't hook up with her and was just there to support her through a rough time (he only recently told me they did actually hook up). I spent the whole week crying at work and just being miserable. He begged me to stay with him and I did, which is something I've never done before. I've never ever ever let someone disrespect me like this before, but I felt so low and vulnerable. We were together for awhile after all that and it was so hard for me to not want to abandon him at any fight we had. We fought a lot and were pretty miserable together. I was really trying to break things off but he kept claiming he really wanted to be with me. He hooked up with a new girl he met and was hanging with secretly behind my back at his friends place for a month or two. What made me really mad is I would let him drive my car over there while I was at work and I bought an Xbox for him to use at my place and he was playing games with her while I was at work. Anyways he hooks up with her and she has BPD too. So off the hop she started tracking his location and everything, so he came clean to me about it and told me she was crazy and regrets doing it. I told him that he should just be with her and just leave me alone. She ended up needing help and he convinced me to go pick her up and help her get drugs. She ends up getting me and him into doing those drugs (we've done it before and were completely sober, just have a hard time saying no when it's right in front of me). We all ended up going on a 7 day bender and by the end of it I was all alone and the most mentally fucked I've ever been. They ended up dating. For a whole month he kept pressuring me to come over and give me drugs to drive them around and he even pressured me into a threesome. I only did it because I'm stupid and just did kinda want to be high and see him. They were absolutely vile to me while I was there and I finally got the back bone to block them and sober up. She would make millions of tiktoks about how she fucked him in the bed beside me to put me in my place and how she wants to beat me up now that I didn't want to be their bitch. She even threatened to send a whole gang of people to my house if I didn't send her money at one point. I was nothing but nice to her, swear on my life! She wanted to put me in my place because I warned her that he can be cheaty and to watch out! And she claimed I was trying to break them up. She still to this day posts about me and it's been a year since him and her were last together. Anyways, I was dating someone and doing shitty but alright. Sober, university drop out, bluey watching, chain smoking, loser on medical leave from work. My ex got me up and I dropped everything to meet up with him and to hear how shit his life was without me (hopefully) and it was. He GOT HER PREGNANT!!! And was absolutely MISERABLE! I was rolling. I wanted to laugh in his face and go back to eating cupcakes and watching bluey buuuutttt I self sabotaged my life and decided I wanted revenge on the girl for being a dick to me so I broke up with my boyfriend ( I held him back anyways, he deserves way better then a dumpster fire like me) and I hooked up with him while she was pregnant and behind her back and threw it in her face and then laughed at the tiktoks of her balling her eyes. I know I'm horrible, I really wasn't thinking right, I was kinda off the rails and sick of feeling like everyone gets to shit on me and have no repercussions, if I could go back in time I would have never met up with him. I didn't want to get back together but I ended up hooking up with him long enough that we did (the sex is the best I've ever had for some reason and he really makes me feel safe because of being there for the stuff with my dad). Getting back together with him made all my friends drop me, they were already mad at me for being too depressed and reclused for awhile.I was an ass to him though, constantly mad about him even being with a girl that was so cruel to other girls like that (even though I kinda was cruel to her by taking him back for revenge for all the shit she did to me). We were once again miserable together but I had quite my other job and now we were miserable and broke. my mom got us a job together and we started to work and save up for an apartment (I'm good at saving, he blew my money and his). I ended up having to borrow the money from my grandma for first and last ($3000, which I still have to pay her back for) I was also the only one allowed on the lease because of my good credit score and before we moved in, while I was working over time, he was looking at the girls onlyfans. Turns out he used his first paycheck to subscribe and look at her shit. It was a big blow up fight and he told me he only wanted to see if she was posting their videos they made together. We already had the apartment lined up so I forgave him and told him to just be honest with me and to never do it again. By that point I was so angry and resentful towards him, I was miserable everyday. He refused to cuddle with me or be affectionate with me at all or even have sex with me. I started becoming an angry violent alcoholic and we started to go at each other. I fucked his teeth up and he left me all bruised up. Our apartment was disgusting, he never helped me clean or cook or do laundry, he just played videogames and ignored me. He also brought his dog that he got with him and that girl together to our apartment and it wasn't house trained so it peed on everything. The dog peed on the couch I bought so much that I had to pay to throw it out. It peed on my Tv remote, laptop, bed and pillows, like literally everything. I dislike dogs because my parents would get aggressive rescues when I was a child that would attack me and I grew up to find them loud, obnoxious, and gross. I was the only one cleaning up after his dog. I found him on onlyfans again buying a bunch of girls content when he couldn't pay his phone bill that was in my name since he had no credit to get a new phone ( I got him a brand new phone and a phone plan), and he was even short on rent most of the time. He literally would beg them to meet up and everything. I was officially numb and done. I tried for a whole week to break up with him sobbing and begging for me not too, he begged me to give him one more month and I agreed. But then his dad died. I was such a a cunt to him though when his dad was dying because of the onlyfans stuff and I dislike dogs and his mom has 13 dogs and her house is covered in piss, shit, dirt, and dog hair. The dogs literally pee on everything. So I tried to support him from a distance, even though I drove him to the hospital and made sure to buy his dad blanket and slippers and soup when he couldn't eat the hospital food. But when it came time for us to wait out his death at his mom's place, I really didn't want to be there for him. I wanted to be able to come during the day but then spend the night at my parents place which was 10 minutes away. But he made me stay and we fought a lot. After his dad past, since we took so much time to take care of him we ended up losing our jobs. I instantly applied for welfare to make sure we could still pay rent, he on the other hand didn't. So I had to borrow money from my mom to pay his half of the rent. I also had to start going to the food bank and he refused to come with me even though I was anxious. I had to make him apply for welfare to help me because he refused to let me have my friends move in for us to be able to pay rent. Eventually I had enough and broke up with him and instantly hopped into a new relationship. I spent the whole month away from him anxious and feeling like shit, he was absolutely miserable and missed me and called me crying everyday. I ended up finding out I was pregnant with his kid (break up sex 🙄) and so I got back together with him and ended up  misscarry on Valentine's day, which was not my worst Valentines day lmao. But since getting back together he's made major improvements and swears on his life he wants to spend the rest of his life with me and I hates himself everyday for what he did to me. He has made major improvements but now I'm so broken and fucked up, I've become just like him when he was treating me like garbage. We had to move into his mom's place since my dad started doing meth again and I have another restraining order against my dad. I just feel triggered constantly at his mom's place. So should I even bother staying with him at this point? He has changed a lot, but now I'm extremely toxic and miserable. I don't know anymore if I'm dumb for believing him still and if I should just get a backbone and leave for good?",1714374244.0,False,1,5,constellationcapra,None,1cfsqxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1cfsqxh/should_i_stay_in_my_messy_relationship/
106,Canadian mental health's week,"This week is Canadian mental health’s week.

I cannot remain silent. I have witnessed so many prejudices related to different mental illnesses. And I have been victim myself of some prejudices related to my mental illness.

I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and I have an eating disorder (ED). 

I am trying really hard to recover from my eating disorder. It has been a year since I am in therapy and take medication. Even though I am on the path of recovery, I am still sick. My day-to-day existence is still challenging. I have been victim of many misconceptions people have about my disease. Today, I want to break those misconceptions. 

First of all, I have gone to my family doctor before my eating disorder went out of control. I’ve told my doctor I was worried about the relationship I had with food. I’ve told her that every time I felt angry, sad or anxious about something, I ate. I’ve told her that I often got up at night to eat things I didn’t allow myself to eat at daytime. I’ve told her that I was sometimes craving for junk food. I’ve told her that I was often eating so much that I felt a pain in my stomach. I’ve also told her that I was constantly checking my weight because I was worried that I was weighing more than my friends. Those are the common symptoms of an eating disorder. My doctor didn’t take me seriously. She didn’t consider my eating behaviors as a problem. Actually, she told me it was quite common among teenagers to like junk food and to eat “too much”. 

For a couple of years, back in high school, my eating behaviors remain the same. I was stealing money from my mother’s purse to buy junk food. I was hiding food in places where my mother could not find it such as my room’s closet. I had drawers filled with wrappers. 

Then, it got worse. Two years ago, I had convinced myself that I had some kind of virus and that I couldn’t digest food anymore. For a week, I had stopped eating. My close ones were worried but they didn’t question my behavior because I had convinced them I had a virus. When I started to eat again, food disgusted me so much that I felt like I couldn’t keep it: I had to throw it all away. And that is what I started to do.  At first, I told my parents that I was throwing up because of the virus. But, it kept getting worse. I could barely eat with them. And when I did, I ate a ridiculously small amount of food. I was throwing up after each meal. And I had started to skip meals. In a matter of a few months, I had lost a lot a weight (something like 25 pounds). At one point, I couldn’t concentrate at school anymore. I was feeling weak. I was feeling anxious around others. At that time, all I wished for was to disappear completely. I told my parents I needed to go to therapy. I knew something was wrong but I didn’t know what it was. My first therapist diagnosed me with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), related to a sexual assault I had been victim of a couple of years before.  Then, I was diagnosed with Depression. Then, I was diagnosed with social anxiety. Then, they found out I had an eating disorder: I was diagnosed with bulimia nervosa. Finally, after a suicide attempt and a stay at the hospital, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). 

I have found it really difficult to hear about the final diagnosis because I knew that this one was accurate. When my therapist first described to me the symptoms of BPD, all I could think was: «It is me. It is all me. Is it all that I am? Am I a disease?» For those of you who don’t know much about BPD, there are nine specific symptoms to this illness but you only need to have five of them to be diagnosed with it. First of all, BPDs fear abandonment. That’s why BPDs make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. Because of that fear of abandonment, BPDs have unstable relationships. BPDs relationships are often intense and short-lived. Also, BPDs have unstable self-image. BPDs may feel good about themselves for a short period of time and then hate themselves. BPDs often don’t know their needs and desires. They may change values, goals, and even sexual identity. Because of their unclear self-image, BPDs engage in impulsive or self-destructive behaviors such as self-harm, risky sex, alcohol or drug abuse, binge eating. Those self-destructive behaviors can lead to suicidal behavior. BPDs also have intense emotional swings. They are described as hypersensitive. In fact, Marsha Linehan, the psychologist whom invented Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), which is now used to treat people with BPD, says: 
“People with BPD are like people with third degree burns over 90% of their bodies. Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement.” BPDs also experiences chronic feelings of emptiness due to their unstable self-image and their lack of self-confidence. BPDs can also struggle with intense anger and can have trouble controlling it. More frequently, BPDs direct their anger towards them. Finally, BPDs can experience episodes of paranoia where they feel suspicious about other’s motives and out of touch with reality.  That feeling can lead to out of body’s experiences. 

After I was diagnosed with BPD, I knew I had to tell my close ones. The impact of the symptoms on my life was so important: I could not pretend that they did not exist anymore. My therapist had warned me that the reactions to my diagnosis could be quite inadequate due to all the misconceptions people have about mental illnesses. Unfortunately, people often see BPD’s desperate calls for help as attention seeking. For example, that is often the way people feel about self-harm and suicidal behavior. Another common misconception is that people think that all BPD sufferers are extroverts. People think all BPDs express their intense emotions at the exact moment they feel them. In fact, some of us keep a lot of those emotions to ourselves. Sometimes, it is because we are not sure how to express those feelings. Sometimes, it is because we don’t even know how we feel: there are so many emotions trapped inside of us that ask to be released.  If you know someone suffering from BPD or from any other mental illness, you have to know there is no magic way to cure for those illnesses. The person who suffers from a mental illness has to be ready to recover and that feeling can only come from her. There is nothing you can do except stand by her side while she is trying her best to recover.  

I hope that my statement will help to demystify BPD and Bulimia Nervosa among some of you. And, I hope that those of you who suffer from any mental illness will feel less lonely. I also hope it will encourage you to speak up to stop the stigmatization of mental illnesses.
