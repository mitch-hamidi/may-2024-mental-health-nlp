DBT is simply about radical acceptance. Such a disappointingly simple but difficult goal. It doesn't cost 40k to work with it. 

If you need a detox program you can find one.",BettySwollocks45,18vug3n

>continue being intimate, and living together and working on our mental health but as ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù

r/codependency. I feel he's using you at that point, for his own sense of security and control. He's done ""future faking"", to make you believe things will change, but... He also doesn't include you in his personal future.

Seems like on your end there's a choice to work on your mental health, even though it will probably hurt both of you to move on, or ""work on"" accepting an unsatisfactory and unpredictable relationship with no real future.",TranZeitgeist,hf0i15
1,"What you‚Äôre saying makes sense and I appreciate you taking the time to try to help me. I also really appreciate that you kinda put my options into two clear concise boxes kinda. I guess now my brain is just trying to warp this information any way that I can into finding a way to have both things‚Äî a way to work on my mental health and have this person around but... yeah it‚Äôs confusing. I do feel a bit used in a way or just like this whole dynamic is toxic. I wish there was a way for he and I to solve this with therapy or to work through all this together but... I suppose that‚Äôs probably impossible and my brain just hoping for something that can‚Äôt exist. I may be having trouble accepting reality right now. I‚Äôm also having a difficult time because I‚Äôm trying to not view everything so black/white. 

I‚Äôll give what you said a think and really consider those two options. I know the obvious answer is to choose myself. This just feels impossible. Seriously thank you for your response. It makes me feel less alone.",Creepazoid1,hf0i15
0,There are workbooks on amazon you can do at home. It's a really good start at introducing some of the ideas in dialectical behavioural therapy. I'm doing The Dialectical Behaviour Therapy Skills Workbook. It's a step in the right direction! You get out what you put in,fluffypinkblonde,c8ccfy
