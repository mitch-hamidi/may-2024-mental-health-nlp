1,Boyfriend (28) doesn’t believe my (F24) mental health diagnosis,We have been together for 7 years and we both struggle with depression anxiety etc so there is history on both sides. Recently I got diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and I felt like it was a correct diagnosis. When I told him he obviously still loves and cares for me the same but he doesn’t agree and thinks that I am just searching for a diagnosis.

2,mental breakdown and trip of a lifetime,"hi all, i've been on a pretty crazy roller-coaster this week.  
yesterday(6/14) i was diagnosed BPD after 'waking up' from psychosis on monday. i've known i was BPD for years but wasn't ready to accept it. it's worth noting i was aware i had been misdiagnosed / treated for bipolar last year, i didnt just decide i have bpd  
i had a crisis appointment with a psychiatrist i've been seeing for a few months- where i confessed every symptom i've been experiencing starting from childhood (i know shes not a therapist, i just gave her facts)  
she recommended more water, sleep and food.  
oh and to take more zinc- i never felt so misunderstood in my entire life. maybe that would be solid advice if i weren't leaving the country for the first time today (6/15). she recomended i cancel my trip due to my breakdown.  
anyways. im not sure what advice im looking for, i suppose anything  
how did you deal with your diagnosis? have you ever been far away from home during a crisis?   
this trip will be life changing for me in a few different ways now.

3,My college teacher used my mental health and my diagnosis of BPD against me.,"I passed college 2nd top grade of my class. Went on to on the job training, where my teacher who was never their accused me of some things, I was really confused by what they accused me of because I never knew what they were talking about. They then said they didnt think i was safe to he their due to mental health issues they noticed. They made me cry because any time a grown man yells at me I can't help but to cry, and he made me tell him my mental health diagnoses. He then went on a spheel about them, said I could go on sick leave or he'd have me kicked out of the program, so I felt obligated to go on sick leave. He completely destroyed me with what he said about me, I quit my job, and relapsed back to drinking alcohol everyday, went to a very dark place. Since then I went to the best PTSD/ addictions program in the country, and I returned to the college and am going to do the  on the job training and work term again. But I need to make sure I don't end up with that man as a supervising teacher. I'm scared of him, how should I bring it up to the college? And who should I talk to about my mental worries. I'm still mentally struggling with a lot of things (PTSD, eating disorder, anxiety, BPD, addiction).

6,How to maintain a relationship with my bio mom while working on my mental health?,"Hi so i'm (20F) am living with my biological mom for the past 2 years, I don't have a job, I'm trying to sign up for therapy, do everything I can so I can get on my feet again, but my family aren't that supportive especially my bio mom. I was taken when I was 3, we used to visit a lot growing up but over time I stopped answering her calls for a reason even I don't know. I was diagnosed when i was 19 and now I'm almost 21 but I've always been like this even as a kid. My bio mom doesn't see that but my adopted parents do and they did everything the could (granted they didn't have a lot of knowledge of how to handle adopting kids) I always thought for the longest time the reason I'm like this was because I wasn't with my bio family but now that I know how my Bio mom is, I realized that maybe I shouldn't have left my parents house.

Ever since moving here, I've been yelled at for things I cant control such as crying over her jokes. She's said things like ""I hate crybabies"" ""I cant handle girls, I hoped you were a boy"" she's never physically affectionate, no hugs, kisses, I cant even lay next to her in her bed when I'm sad. She tries to make it seem like I'm an awful daughter. She calls me a bitch more than she says my name. I ran away once because I couldn't handle it anymore and then when I came back I told her how my friend let me stay with his mom, how I spent the whole time with them and she cried with me even tho she speaks spanish and I don't. She's hugged me kissed my forehead more times than my mom has in my lifetime. gave me clothes, let me sleep on her bed while she took the floor, basically everything a mom does for her kids. I then told her how I felt like I deserved to sleep on the streets but they didn't want me to and were worried about me. Her response was ""you deserved to sleep on the streets for acting like a bitch"" The whole argument she's talking about was bc I had $7 and I wasn't sure if I wanted to give it to her because she's an alcoholic and she wanted to buy beer and I kept telling her idk it's all I have left and to her it wasn't the answer she was looking for. She kept asking and I kept saying the same thing, its the last of my money but it's my social security money and I like to save the little amount I have for myself for the next month (I get less than $100 a month) and it turned into me being ungrateful, disrespectful, making her look stupid and my biggest trigger is yelling, she knows this and was yelling an inch away from my face and I was terrified I was shaking and crying and closing my eyes and she said ""why you scared? I never hit you whoever told you that is a liar, you're such a pussy"" ""youre so much bigger than me and stronger"" She also brought my bio dad into it who I haven't seen in years due to his ongoing struggle with addiction and it scared me because I love him more than anything, he's my favorite person always have been. It was unfair because he's not stable, he doesn't know what's going on with me because he wants to keep me away from all that for my safety. Oh, not to mention, my step sister (12) agrees with my mom that I'm disrespectful, I hate her how I don't deserve her ect. I get she's a kid so I don't hold it against her but it really does make me feel like I'm the problem

It was like a snowball effect, anyways, I've been thinking of calling my parents and telling them but I'm scared on how they will take it because my mom is my bio mom's half sister and she loves us both and has seen me on my horrible days and she might agree with my bio mom. I keep on wanting to ask to come home but to me, it feels like everyone hates me and doesnt want me around and it's getting to the point where I wanna end everything. Is this something that i can overcome or is this really a bad situation? I'm trying to get counseling but it'll take a couple months and I'm trying to find an alternative to living here but I know that stress will end up killing me.

9,Should I leave or help a person with mental disorder?,"Someone that I love, suffered from a serious mental disorder, both BPD and DID. At this state, I don't know if I should go help him or not as they is no cure for this disorder but giving him endless of support is very important. We did have a strong connection between us. 
The problem is if I go help him to face this together, you don't know what will happen in the future. Uhmm I don't know how should I put my words in this. 

For now, I am still thinking if I should leave him or not but of course that's the most selfish decisions ever to be made. Yeah, you know why, because loving someone with mental disorder takes a lot of efforts. 

At the same time, I can't forgive myself the fact that he warned me about his illness two years ago but I just ignored it. (I'm sorry for my ignorance in understanding mental disorder) 

But I love him. He did left me hanging 7 years ago, and opened up to me about his illness just recently. He told me he couldn't tell me about it because he didn't want me to suffer with him and better for me to leave him.

13,Canadian mental health's week,"This week is Canadian mental health’s week.

I cannot remain silent. I have witnessed so many prejudices related to different mental illnesses. And I have been victim myself of some prejudices related to my mental illness.

I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and I have an eating disorder (ED). 

I am trying really hard to recover from my eating disorder. It has been a year since I am in therapy and take medication. Even though I am on the path of recovery, I am still sick. My day-to-day existence is still challenging. I have been victim of many misconceptions people have about my disease. Today, I want to break those misconceptions. 

First of all, I have gone to my family doctor before my eating disorder went out of control. I’ve told my doctor I was worried about the relationship I had with food. I’ve told her that every time I felt angry, sad or anxious about something, I ate. I’ve told her that I often got up at night to eat things I didn’t allow myself to eat at daytime. I’ve told her that I was sometimes craving for junk food. I’ve told her that I was often eating so much that I felt a pain in my stomach. I’ve also told her that I was constantly checking my weight because I was worried that I was weighing more than my friends. Those are the common symptoms of an eating disorder. My doctor didn’t take me seriously. She didn’t consider my eating behaviors as a problem. Actually, she told me it was quite common among teenagers to like junk food and to eat “too much”. 

For a couple of years, back in high school, my eating behaviors remain the same. I was stealing money from my mother’s purse to buy junk food. I was hiding food in places where my mother could not find it such as my room’s closet. I had drawers filled with wrappers. 

Then, it got worse. Two years ago, I had convinced myself that I had some kind of virus and that I couldn’t digest food anymore. For a week, I had stopped eating. My close ones were worried but they didn’t question my behavior because I had convinced them I had a virus. When I started to eat again, food disgusted me so much that I felt like I couldn’t keep it: I had to throw it all away. And that is what I started to do.  At first, I told my parents that I was throwing up because of the virus. But, it kept getting worse. I could barely eat with them. And when I did, I ate a ridiculously small amount of food. I was throwing up after each meal. And I had started to skip meals. In a matter of a few months, I had lost a lot a weight (something like 25 pounds). At one point, I couldn’t concentrate at school anymore. I was feeling weak. I was feeling anxious around others. At that time, all I wished for was to disappear completely. I told my parents I needed to go to therapy. I knew something was wrong but I didn’t know what it was. My first therapist diagnosed me with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), related to a sexual assault I had been victim of a couple of years before.  Then, I was diagnosed with Depression. Then, I was diagnosed with social anxiety. Then, they found out I had an eating disorder: I was diagnosed with bulimia nervosa. Finally, after a suicide attempt and a stay at the hospital, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). 

I have found it really difficult to hear about the final diagnosis because I knew that this one was accurate. When my therapist first described to me the symptoms of BPD, all I could think was: «It is me. It is all me. Is it all that I am? Am I a disease?» For those of you who don’t know much about BPD, there are nine specific symptoms to this illness but you only need to have five of them to be diagnosed with it. First of all, BPDs fear abandonment. That’s why BPDs make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. Because of that fear of abandonment, BPDs have unstable relationships. BPDs relationships are often intense and short-lived. Also, BPDs have unstable self-image. BPDs may feel good about themselves for a short period of time and then hate themselves. BPDs often don’t know their needs and desires. They may change values, goals, and even sexual identity. Because of their unclear self-image, BPDs engage in impulsive or self-destructive behaviors such as self-harm, risky sex, alcohol or drug abuse, binge eating. Those self-destructive behaviors can lead to suicidal behavior. BPDs also have intense emotional swings. They are described as hypersensitive. In fact, Marsha Linehan, the psychologist whom invented Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), which is now used to treat people with BPD, says: 
“People with BPD are like people with third degree burns over 90% of their bodies. Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement.” BPDs also experiences chronic feelings of emptiness due to their unstable self-image and their lack of self-confidence. BPDs can also struggle with intense anger and can have trouble controlling it. More frequently, BPDs direct their anger towards them. Finally, BPDs can experience episodes of paranoia where they feel suspicious about other’s motives and out of touch with reality.  That feeling can lead to out of body’s experiences. 

After I was diagnosed with BPD, I knew I had to tell my close ones. The impact of the symptoms on my life was so important: I could not pretend that they did not exist anymore. My therapist had warned me that the reactions to my diagnosis could be quite inadequate due to all the misconceptions people have about mental illnesses. Unfortunately, people often see BPD’s desperate calls for help as attention seeking. For example, that is often the way people feel about self-harm and suicidal behavior. Another common misconception is that people think that all BPD sufferers are extroverts. People think all BPDs express their intense emotions at the exact moment they feel them. In fact, some of us keep a lot of those emotions to ourselves. Sometimes, it is because we are not sure how to express those feelings. Sometimes, it is because we don’t even know how we feel: there are so many emotions trapped inside of us that ask to be released.  If you know someone suffering from BPD or from any other mental illness, you have to know there is no magic way to cure for those illnesses. The person who suffers from a mental illness has to be ready to recover and that feeling can only come from her. There is nothing you can do except stand by her side while she is trying her best to recover.  

I hope that my statement will help to demystify BPD and Bulimia Nervosa among some of you. And, I hope that those of you who suffer from any mental illness will feel less lonely. I also hope it will encourage you to speak up to stop the stigmatization of mental illnesses.

24,bpd spiral after old trauma reminder?,"ok to start off i've never really posted on reddit let alone posted about something so personal but right now i feel desperate and so helpless. i don't know what else to do other than reach out to others that have felt similarly or been in similar situations. i (18f) have not been diagnosed with bpd officially but have talked about it with multiple therapists/psychiatrists before age 18. where i live, they do not diagnose people under the age of 18 with mental illness other than depression&anxiety at most of the mental health facilities. i struggled from age 11 til now trying to find an answer of jus ""what's wrong wit me"".  even now it's like all signs point to the diagnosis and discussing coping mechanisms but it's always, ""it could be something else tho"" i was always told that because i was so young, n because i was a girl that it could basically be anything from simply jus depression to ""over exaggerated hormones"" but always leaving wit the same question n no answers. i recently got into a serious relationship w my partner not even 2 years ago. and i sometimes wonder how he even still sticks around. then i wonder when he'll finally jus get tired of it n it already seems like he is. i feel so difficult. i feel annoying. an it feels like i have no control over any of it. like as soon as i get a little tiny grip of my emotions i completely lose my grasp on how to cope mentally to jus function thru the day. im a regular ass mexican female in a regular ass mexican family that will never truly understand how deep mental illness goes. i want love and understanding. i jus want someone to feel as compassionate about me as i feel about them but then i remember, i always feel i don't deserve it. i feel unworthy of it. my emotions feel so intense that i almost jus can't handle it i miss being numb to shit most the time. i don't know who to go to anymore or where to turn n i don't want to resort back to old ways of feeling better. i was doing so much better. then old triggers from the past bring back everything x100.",1699725360.0,False,7,1,analisyag,None,17szsas,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/17szsas/bpd_spiral_after_old_trauma_reminder/
25,Mom makes it about her,"Both my biological parents have severe mental illnesses. I was bound to end up with them too. I was adopted by my bio dad’s parents who ended up emotionally abusing most of my adolescent years. I was told my whole life by my adopted parents that my bio mom was an evil person who never loved me and my bio dad loved me so much. As I got older I found out that it was the opposite. But because of all my childhood trauma and genetics I ended up with bpd, bipolar 1, anxiety and c-ptsd. I recently was able to move out of my adopted parents home and move across country to be with my bio mom. I’ve been here for over two months and it’s been a big lifestyle change. With my adopted parents I was given the most expensive things and taken on lots of vacations. Now with my mom we are living in government housing for the mentally ill. And recently our apartment got a massive flood from heavy rains. In the two months I’ve been here I haven’t had much issue with my mental health. But the stress of moving across country into government assisted housing and then the flood, my mental state has declined a bit. When I woke up this morning I wasn’t in a good headspace so I stayed in my room because I didn’t want to snap at my mom or my 4 year old sister. I finally got up at 11:30am and my mom wouldn’t say a word to me. Then it was time to go get my sister from preschool and I always go with to get her so I was getting dressed and my mom told me I wasn’t allowed to go and to go back to my room until dinner and not interact with my sister tonight. When she got back from getting my sister she came in and started yelling at me for not getting up this morning. I tried to explain to her that I didn’t want to snap at her or my sister and she went off on me saying that’s she’s stressed too and that I need to get over it. I feel guilty for not getting up this morning but in over 2 months not once have I needed to take some time alone to keep myself from breaking.

29,How do I date as a girl with BPD?,"I am a 23(f) dealing with relationship anxiety. I dont know how to date and Im scared i might end up alone because I feel like I’m broken and mentally unstable. For context, I was diagnosed with BPD and CPTSD at an early age due to r*pe and physical and psychological trauma inflicted on me by my parents. Due to this, i developed an anxiety attachment style which has been destructive for my mental health. I have tried going to therapy but I’ve been turned down because they dont believe my story and I honestly dont blame them. So every-time i got into a new relationship, i try to please my then mans in every way possible… be it unlimited excess to my body, running me over or just plain mistreatment, I would accept it because I didn’t wanna lose the guy. And because I’m curvy built, a lot of men are attracted to me physically but never have I met a guy who was willing to get to know me on a personal level. It got so bad that I hated any guy who complimented me with sexual annotations like “hey s*xy” or “hey curvy” and just generally hated anything to do with s*x. It always broke me whenever they left. Now currently I’m seeing a guy 27(M) who seems genuinely interested in me. But my stupid brain keeps telling me he is gonna leave me eventually. I have communicated how I felt like about the whole situation and he seemed to have understood my situation. We have gone out several times and it’s great but somehow i feel like communication has slowly decreased. Im scared that maybe its because I haven’t slept with him or anything and I honestly dont know what to do. I began acting indifferent and he sat me down and asked me why I’m acting like I dont care anymore when deep down i do but i don’t know how to communicate my feelings.

30,(TW) Bpd x bpd relationship. Advice?,"Hi. I never use reddit and just made this account like 10 mins ago so please excuse if I'm not really doing this right. And sorry for the length I've added a ""TLDR"" at the end (is that how you do it?)
TW Substance abuse, Institutions, Suicidal Ideation, Psychosis, Police Brutality, Eating Disorders (possible other tw I forgot to mention)
I am F20 dating someone with bpd M24. We have known each other a year now (started relationship April 2023 then both didnt talk for 3 months May 2023-Sep 2023 because we both went to rehab in different places) and honestly the way we met kinda.. will raise some red flags for some people but honestly I am not looking for anyone to comment on that aspect. We met in a psych ward in April 2023. Both at super low points. I was in a severe manic/psychotic episode as I also struggle with bipolar disorder. I had stayed up for 4 nights straight and maybe eaten 2 meals during that time. When I got there I weighed under 100 pounds. I was having delusions and convinced myself I had alters. I had no idea that the guy I was with was giving me weed that was laced with benzos. He also had laid hands on me and cheated during the relationship as well. I didnt even find out I tested positive for the benzos until a while later. The psychward I went to was absolutaly disgusting and also didn't tell me I had very abnormal blood levels and forced psych meds down my throat. I don't even think it was the right time to start those meds with my weight and health issues and substances in my body. It was pretty much medical abuse. And it was my second ever time, besides when I was 16, going to a mental hospital. My boyfriend, on the other hand, was considered a ""frequent flyer."" He struggled with lots of substance abuse and suicidal thoughts. I would find out later that he admitted himself this time because he was feeling awful about not having his old FP. When I first saw him, he mentioned having BPD in a group therapy and explaining how it was affecting him. My ears perked up listening to him. He was just a great talker, vulnerable, and accountable for himself. I don't remember a lot from when we first met because of all the different things going on with my brain, but I talked to him by passing him a note (I think the note may have been about the staff at the psych ward.) We both began talking the whole time we were there after that. There was absolutely no activities, the staff treated us like utter garbage, and we both were too restless to just sit around all day. We would talk ""walks"" down the hallways just talking. About everything. There was so much chemistry. He somehow knew how exactly to calm me down. We both knew how to make eachother laugh. He was optimistic, despite how awful different circumstances he had were. Way more optimistic than me. He pointed out a big photo on the wall of a colorful wave and said to pretend we were taking a walk on the beach together.  We also did have one activity room we would go in maybe once out of the whole week that had a piano and some playing cards. I played Heart and Soul as a duet with him. We somehow made that awful situation we were in into something enjoyable. As days passed, he started opening up about how he had a charge of battery on an officer. Basically, he was in the same mental hospital we were in at the time, and he was having an episode. He is a black man with tattoos, so everyone just treated him as if he was dangerous and aggressive before he even got to any point like that. I don't know exactly what happened, but they didn't attempt to deescalate at all. A police officer came over to slam him against the wall and tell him ""you'd be better off dead."" He then spit in the officers direction. And that's it. He didn't hit him or attempt to hit him.  Because of covid, that action he took is considered battery against a police officer, and he was looking at a minimum of 10 years in prison for it. The case is still ongoing as we speak. He's doing a mental health diversion to get the felony off his record, and he's trying to get the case dropped. If the case is dropped, he plans to sue. So basically, everything has been extremely stressful for both of us the entire time we have known each other. But we connect so well. I have never felt so much love and passion for someone. After the mental hospital, we hung out for weeks. We did smoke a lot of weed together and both of us started getting worse mentally. I got sent to psych 2 more times after the first time and then got transferred to residential on the 3rd time. The 3rd time I went was because I went to his house, had severe psychosis, and he had to call the police on me. We weren't really together for quite a few months and I even broke off talking to him because I needed to recover. Then, I reached out again in September. We both relapsed, and I would see him once a week so my use was weekly and his was daily. He lives with his mother who has a medical card and gives him free weed. Now, we both are over 2 weeks sober and plan to stay that way. But the relationship had gotten tense and strained. We don't use escapism for our feelings anymore. We even quit nicotine. We started eating healthy, exercising, and finding ourselves. But it's so hard. I know people say two sick people can't get better together, but I just want to prove them wrong. I want us to be healthy. So many things make us insecure. We are both terrified of losing each other. We both want to get out of our triggering households together. But we both struggle with things. I'm going back to regular talk therapy and he's about to start his therapy too. I even want to do couples therapy. But money is a huge issue. He couldn't work for the entire time we have been together. I've only had a part-time retail job that pays 13 an hour. He's been mad that I'm working way more and seeing him less. I'm trying to explain that I'm doing this for us. It hurts him because he wants to be a caretaker and he wants to be the breadwinner. But realistically, I'm the one who can work rn. And I'm even struggling with that as well because I got in a car accident in an Uber and my back is messed up. The pain is making me constantly irritated. Please. I know a lot of people might say this doesn't seem like it's possible it could work, but I want some optimism. Me and him both want it to work and are willing to do anything we possibly can to make it work. Any advice is so appreciated. Thank you.

I have tried my best to explain the situation and tried desperately to not be too much with my mental health, which he knew about and said he understood and that he would reassure me when needed. However, since then he has been quite distant. Leaving me on seen, barely talking to me and what's worse is that my abandonment issues are heavily triggered by his new found romantic interest. 

He also struggles with his mental health and I've been feeling like i have became nothing more than a grey cloud over his head and an insufferable burden.

","I know this post is very long but please take the time to read, I really need ur opinions and help on this one🥺🙏🙏

I (20f) and my partner (26m) have been waiting to get married for 6months now, we have been together for 4 years now, engaged for 1. I struggle with bpd but we found this out during the relationship. During our whole relationship it has been rough, when I met him I was very young and had just came out of a very abusive relationship (when I say just it was probably nearly a year later) and was still recovering, he knew this and we made it work anyway. It was great for a while, I started really feeling better with my mental health. Then I got assaulted by one of his friends. ( It's a long story but I won't get into it now) Obviously my mental health degraded after that and I was in and out of hospital and that is when they figured out I had bpd. It was a horrible time in my life and to me felt like forever. Right when all of this was happening COVID hit, my bf lost his house bc his roommates left unexpectedly bc of COVID and he couldn't afford it anymore. So I was still living with my parents at the time and I was SOOO ill that my parents agreed to my bf moving in with us as he was helping so much with my mental health. The plan was always to leave and move in with eachother but life sucks as you all may know. We saved enough money to leave together and work on the other side of world with his dad, we were there for 3 months but to put it short his dad fucked us over and then Brexit happened ( I'm British) so I was not allowed to work basically anywhere and had to leave. So we came back to my parents and decided to get married as we had previously been engaged for a year anyway so we could build the life together that we wanted. So that would have been 6 months since we came back and decided to do all of this, I spent a lot of money on paperwork and got very stressed about it. In this period of time our relationship was under a lot of stress and pressure and let's just say that my bf ""cracked"", I am very patient with him given how patient he was with me and how much he helped me with everything, but I can only put up with so much. He has been shouting at me and calling me names every day for maybe 8 months. So eventually we got to a point where we could finally get married and go away together but because of his behaviour I am not well enough to go now, I had to quit my job due to panic attacks coming back. Had a trip to the hospital and now back on meds and I am physically ill from my anxiety (vomiting, nauseous, not sleeping) We had a very long chat and for obvious reasons have cancelled the marriage because I am not well enough to leave yet and because of how toxic everything has become, he says that he behaved this way because of stress and is very sorry about the whole situation. He wants to stay here for a few months (I don't know how comfortable I am with that) and save up money so that he can leave on his own ( he hadn't been working since we came back which really bugs me) and I have to stay with my parents where they can look after me and I can get the help I need with the psychologist bc where we want to go I will have no insurance or right to it and I NEED it right now. His plan is to work and study at the same time while he is there and then go to uni and after uni come and get me. Which to me seems like a silly plan, I can make a year work but not 4 years. Also I feel like after everything happened it's not really the same anymore between us (I really do love him but it's all a bit too much) I just feel a bit in shock with all of this bc it all happened very fast and suddenly I am now trying to figure out my life. I am 20 with very little work experience and little to no education (I am very intelligent but could not do these things due to panic disorder) I have 0 friends, I only have my mum and dad and we have very little money. I want to move away but it seems nearly impossible on my own and I just feel a bit defeated by this whole situation. Obviously I think being on my own and focusing on my mental health and getting a job that works for me would be the best thing for me rn, but obviously bc of my bpd I am terrified of being alone and it's already hard as it is bc I have no social life apart from him and it been like that for so long that I don't really know where to start. I just don't really know what to do in this situation, he seems to think that if he leaves and does all of this he can make it work between us, but I am not so sure.

38,Am I really that bad?,"This has been the week from hell and all because of my shitty job.

 For reference, I am an introvert and pretty quiet—even my BPD is quiet. I usually only speak when I'm spoken to.  I don't have any particular interests in striking up conversations with other people because I find it physically and mentally exhausting. Furthermore, I don't think I'd have much in common with others.

 I sense that my boss dislikes my personality.  During a meeting she said— in front of everyone—that I have a ""dark aura"". It made me feel uneasy. I didn't think I bothered people by simply not talking a lot. 

She even questioned my coworker and asked if we speak and what they think of me; she says I'm a ""gloomy person.""

40,Hyper fixed on BPD and panicking if I have it ):,"I’ve struggled with mental health my whole life. Depression, and anxiety and self esteem issues. I’ve also always been a sensitive person. I grew up with an emotionally absent dad, who neglected me with basic affection and love aside from providing for me physically, and an emotionally unstable mother who would rarely get physical and throw things, get angry and triggered easily. My parents caught CONSTANTLY. That is all I know. Anyways, I tend to Google things, especially lately because I’ve really been struggling with my mental health the past 4 years. I’ve heard of BPD (borderline personality disorder). I know the symptoms / traits, and so as you can imagined while googling, and watching videos, I notice that I line up with a lot. I’m emotional, I can get triggered easily, when I am in a relationship, I always need reassurance, and am scared they’ll ending leave me, etc. but doesn’t everyone not want their partner leaving them? I can definitely be emotional - like I said, I’ve always been sensitive, am hard on myself, am insecure and scared of judgment, anxious all of the time, struggle with handling a lot of stressors, I have self esteem issues, and I overthink like NON OTHER in general. Im just always in my head is how I can describe it. Im VERY self aware at least. Anyways - the fact that I see traits lining up, scares the absolute SHIT out of me. If I have it, I feel like I will end up being alone for the rest of my life, and be so doomed because people with BPD struggle in marriages / relationships, I’m so scared if I have kids, it would be passed down to them, and I would have negative effects on them, what if I’m not taken seriously, people are scared of me, I turn into my mother, etc etc. what if what if what if is just running through my mind.

I am extremely self aware and have been made aware of how fu king terrible I make everyone feel. And I want to do better for others bit feel others aren’t willing to do better on my behalf as well..

(Side note: A  pillow got rudely tossed over at me to make room for other roommate on couch and its like you can also carry the pillow and not toss it over as if nobody was already sitting on the other side it literally makes me
feel like shit when things are pushed over at me as such. as it would make the other roommate feel same if the pillow had been tossed at them. which IT NEVER WOULD BE TOSSED AT THEM BECASUE for what ever reason respecting them is easier than respecting my mentally ill ass. Even though its similar conflict and situations daily but I’m feeling like I’m the fucking problem constantly.

 And now they peering over at me while I type like. Look at back at your own work. I’m being healthy and not engaging and instead talking to you all.

for any of that. I dont know if I even necessarily blame others either. I’m just tired of always feeing like an after thought. And then everyone being all you make the atmosphere of the room so weird try and like not be so mentally ill outwardly m’kay.)

I'm a 23F, and my boyfriend is a 39M. 
I have BPD, bipolar and all that ""wonderful"" stuff. Anyways, as someone with BPD, I have major mood swings at the drop of a pin. When my boyfriend and I get into arguments, we just kind of give eachother space, and time to think. 

Well, recently my boyfriend and I got into an argument. I just started a new really mentally exhausting job, and already was feeling stressed. Well that stressed turned into depression and I told him I wasn't feeling great mentally. Anyways, he gave me a little attitude later that night, and I had had it. I was done. Over. I left and texted him that I was planning on sticking a towel in my exhaust and let my car run. 

He showed up to where I was and asked what I was doing. I told him I was overwhelmed and wanted everything to end. 
Instead of staying there asking me if he could help, or even show any sort of support. He left. He fucking left. 
I felt hurt, lost, crushed, everything. I hated that feeling. 

I called him later on to tell him once again why I wanted to do that, and how I was feeling. Instead of being helpful, he screamed at me, blaming me because I left first, and he thought he was showing up to his dead girlfriend. 

I understand I shouldn't have told him I was going to kill myself, but at the moment. I felt like I had no choice. I wanted to end it all.

48,VENT // 2023 is Crazy and I'm trying to be strong,"TW: ED

So this year it was awful. I moved, got my car broken into the second day. A day before my birthday I got into a horrible car accident (wrecked both cars). Someone new entered my life. My new coworker ""C"". She is a bit of a emotional and mental burden, I can especially say that now.  That said C and I get along well, but inside I am writhing in pain and fear. Working with her is a bit mentally draining, she is a diva and also can be overwhelming during our shared shift. Not much of a team worker. She is an explosive manipulative (maybe victim complex/ narcissistic) character, and just recently she got my hours cut at work (too much detail to type, but am in the process of figuring out how to get my work hours back and communicate to my boss about this). 

 Throughout all of this I have tried very hard to stay calm and move accordingly. DBT helped a lot through all this. Never would I have thought as an adult I can have moments where I'm proud of myself. Definitely a long complicated dark journey. 

However through all this, my ED came back. I'm trying to be self aware on how to cope with this. Yes I'm going through alot, but also I feel a large feel that I am dissociating most of the time. Days feel like a blur, if its not ED, I found myself drinking and smoking. Like its always something self sabotaging. Ik this is common with BPD. And I'm working to try to slow that cycle to try to put my own needs first.

I also recently got into a situation ship which is slowly moving into a relationship. There is a lot of nervousness about it, I am trying to navigate as well. I can feel the stages of Obsessive neediness, Withdrawing and withholding, and Escalating devaluation coming in. I don't know how to navigate that and its scary. I have never been successful with it as well. I'm also scared he became my FP with all of this shit going on. I want someone to just tell me what to do tbh, but ik thats also really hard. 

I want to explode and ruin/end all my surrounding relationships. I am also financially struggling and going to even more with the shit ""C"" pulled. I know a mental spiral is coming. I don't want it to. Any advice or guidance?

I'm not sure if this is going to make any sense, but maybe it will. Whenever I have a bpd flare up with someone else involved - typically someone who I believe is mad at me and hates me - I tend to disappear for awhile and wallow in self pity, and it's weirdly comforting? And while I'm just sitting there hating myself and trying to distance myself from the person who I'm convinced is disgusted with me, they will eventually come back and say they're sorry for something they did that hurt my feelings, but I'll kind of ""milk it out"" so to speak, and get this strange satisfaction or high from being upset and having strong mental and physical feelings? There's also a part of me that milks this out to make the other person feel bad which I know is probably very manipulative, but it's satisfying in a way. It's very hard to explain and I'm honestly unsure if anyone gets what I mean or has experienced this.

The answer WILL be no because I'm not feeling that way at the times I'm able to call, I explain that it switches at a tip of a hat and is completely uncontrollable sometimes. So they say okay that's good call back when you do. WHICH I FUCKING CAN'T WHEN I FEEL THAT WAY! WHICH I EXPLAIN! Yet the answer is call back when you feel like that. I don't know what to do.

53,Asperger’s & BPD in a Relationship?,"okay so I haven’t posted on here before and this is kinda nerve wracking, but I wanted to ask if anyone has any experience being in a relationship with someone who has Asperger’s? 

I have BPD (24 F) and my partner (23 M) has Asperger’s. We have been together for 3 years. I really enjoy when we are both on the same wave length - we have similar hobbies and interests and can get into fun deep conversations about things. 

The thing is, is that I feel very much emotionally abandoned a lot of the time. I feel like he doesn’t think like how I think (because he literally doesn’t) and I struggle because he just does what he feels in any given moment. His facial expressions can be very neutral too which to me feels like he hates me (I have tried to not assume this and ask if he is okay etc, but I can’t help it when he looks raging sometimes) 

Recently we’ve been having a few arguments regarding mental health. I don’t feel he is accommodating to me a lot of the time, and I do so much for him. I cook and clean and do things that I know would make him happy before he’s even thought of it. I am hypervigilant and want to do everything I can to make him happy. However as I get older, I realise that my needs always go unmet. I never feel cared for or looked after and I want him to provide that. Anytime I bring it up it turns into an argument about how I don’t understand his mental health struggles and then I go off the rails because I just feel like he’s not listening to me and that I’m literally doing everything in my power to make a nice life for us. And then it turns into an argument about how I am crazy and can’t control my anger etc. I always end up apologising and we just ignore it. 

It’s hard to know what to do. I love him, but I don’t want to like through another year of feeling uncared for. 

I also struggle to know if it is my bpd acting up or if I am actually being rational. Any help would be great thank yo",1696611774.0,False,2,3,Tiny_Lime5707,None,171hqaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/171hqaj/aspergers_bpd_in_a_relationship/

55,I subconsciously forgive the people who have hurt me ,"I think this is mostly because my memory has gone to shit. But i don’t hold grudges, i can’t hold grudges even if i wanted to. My parents for example, the biggest thing my parents have done to hurt me is lie to me about my biological dad, created a whole fake scrapbook to keep up with the lies, with false dates and names. I would not have found out the truth if The biological father (who i don’t have in my life because i chose not to) hadn’t found me and told me the truth himself. My parents made this all about them, my mom made excuses for herself and my dad felt betrayed and ignored me for weeks when the truth came out, he expected an apology from me. I never had a good relationship with my dad, i thought i hated him he was always angry at everyone, he was verbally abusive and strict af, i couldnt breathe around him. My mom stopped defending me because he would just yell at her and then she would yell at me saying she would never defend me again. Every terrible argument i had with my parents ended with me telling myself “remember this feeling remember how hurt you are-remember their words dont forgive them for this” But i always forgive even without an apology. I moved out almost 2 years ago and i feel safer, im not used to arguing and being yelled at anymore, but now ive become more sensitive to everything, i still see my parents from time to time and when they yell or bicker with me in the slightest i cry and i kind of start to tweak out. They look at me like im crazy and tell me i dont know how to handle discipline i dont need to cry over everything. I dont want to fucking cry but i cant help it and knowing that im making a fool of myself just bawling my eyes out makes me more angry with myself and my reaction to things. My mom has put me in mental hospitals just because she didnt know what to do with me anymore. After my first and only attempt to take my life she became reliant on mental hospitals to just take me away whenever things got bad. And that brought more trauma, so mucb happened to me in those places and she swore it was meant to help me. Then i was in a residential treatment center for 2 months, i had to live there, i didnt see the outside world at all. Thats when i got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and thats when i started to hate myself more. 
Theres so much i could say this isnt even half, now all i will ever be is my trauma its made me into such a complex person and i cant deal with myself anymore. I dont feel a strong love for my parents, i could move to a city far away and never talk to my entire family ever again and i would be fine, except my little siblings ofc id miss them. No matter what i can forgive my parents which is without saying because they’re all i have. But even past boyfriends , past friends who have destroyed me i can still talk to them because i dont remember the hurt i felt only the action, and i do forget sometimes, so people take advantage of that, the people in my life know that they can walk all over me and i wont hold it against them for too long.

But when my brother was here he started confessing to me all these horrible things he has done, and one being that he used to poison my mom when he was younger cause she was so mean to him he says but he also mentioned that he used to hurt little animals so that way the animals would rely on him to fix them, he is 42 years old but has this petty mentality and if you do him wrong, he’s gonna get his revenge but make it more spicier than it should be. But I’m having a hard time with accepting the treatment I went through as a child the treatment I endured growing up, it’s not so much anything I did or have done where the guilt or shame is stemming from but it’s the way I was brought up, it’s the other peoples shame and guilt that has been stowed upon me from my own family. The people that were supposed to be close to me. After getting this bpd diagnosis I am finally having clarity over my life but I’m realizing that I need to let of things in the past, I need to build a relationship with myself, I want to fall in love with myself before I bring anyone else into my life, this diagnosis doesn’t define but it gives me a answer to why I am the way I am, but how I can help myself and build myself up to be that person I want be around, to be the change that I want to see in this world. Just because you have bpd it doesn’t mean you have to continue on with behaviors that you don’t like about yourself. Become aware of it and find a healthier solution to cope to express myself but implementing the solutions that are very uncomfortable to me because I didn’t like the person I was but now, now lol I’ve come so far an doing the inner work is paying off but I still have a very long way to go and quitting isn’t a option. Yes I have my meltdowns today was one of those days but I think what sparked it was having this crazy dream about my dad who isn’t here anymore and he passed away 6 years on April 22, 2018 an I to have this dream that I had, where I was being shown past memories of myself and where I’ve would’ve staying in abusing relationships an choose them because I want them to love me, I want them to stay, in this dream I choose myself on 3 different occasions with my dad an 2 of my exs, I choose myself and I walked away from all of these people with no hesitations. It makes me feel good that I’m able to see my hard work pay off. But also I just walked away from a codependent relationship in February so I am doing the things! I am trying to be the authentic version of myself but love myself during this time as well. I just wanted to share cause I don’t have anyone else to share it with. I really enjoy being alone now. It’s my peace for the first time in a very long time. ",1713941935.0,False,4,0,Usual-South-6520,None,1cbrtzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1cbrtzr/family_members/
64,Emotional outbursts,"Hi guys, I’m new in here and need help. I have come a long way in healing myself and trying to cope with my BPD. Recently my irritability has gotten worse and worse where I got so upset about my friends dog eating my shoe that I took it out on my friend in the middle of Walmart.. I felt so guilty afterward and felt like I wanted to end everything;  this friend is also my FP. They’ve done so much for me and I just want them to feel happy again but it’s hard to do that while I’m struggling so bad. I feel like I ruin everything and feel so empty. My depression and SH is getting out of hand as well and I’m sharing this with my care team but I bottle it up while I’m not with friends. I’m getting to the point where I don’t want to try anymore and I’m afraid that’ll make me lose my friendships and lose my relationships with my mom again. Some symptoms I’ve been having is isolating, extreme irritability, constant feeling of loneliness, intense emotions, trying to shut people out and taking it out on myself through my ED and other harmful coping mechanisms. My therapist is trying to do child work with me and at this point it’s doing more harm than good for my mental state.

65,advice/medication side effects,"hi,

i feel a little silly(?) if that’s the right word, maybe embarrassed but i just met with my local community mental health team assessor today for the first time. after 15 years of being messed about, let down etc she actually listened to me and said she doesn’t diagnose but she said i can tell this isn’t clinical depression and your symptoms seem to suggest EUPD(the word she used), and said she thinks the doctor is going to prescribe mood stabilisers, so i’m wondering what are the side effects like for any mood stabiliser? just to prepare myself. 

also, does anyone have any advice on how to come with finally getting that diagnosis? just to add, i’ve had many GPs suggest i probably have BPD but they never actually referred me on to get this support/actual diagnosis 

thank you and i appreciate any advice/comments

81,Struggling to deal with dreams vs current reality.,"For context, I’m in a very happy, very stable relationship with my fiancé and we have a lovely child together.
Sorry this is long but the context is vital to the problem.

However, before I was with my fiancé, I was in a very intense relationship with a friend, when the relationship ended we hung out a little for a couple months but then started a fwb type thing, I still very obviously at the time had feelings for him and we broke it off again, few months later and I was falling for my now fiancé but I was pretty mentally unstable and restarted the fwb arrangement with my ex (this time without feelings involved) after two weeks I realised that I was ready for a relationship and hey presto I’m here today. My ex and I hung out a couple more times after I got with my now fiancé but it dwindled and I haven’t seen him in well over 2 years now.


Now onto my actual problem, we were really good friends and I often find myself missing that bond, for example last night I had a dream we met up again and we shared a lovely hug. But every time I dream of him or think about him, it haunts me for the ENTIRE day and sometimes longer! 

I know that I’m probably just seeking that same sort of friendship and not just his friendship specifically but I’m honestly sick of basically dissociating every time he exists in my mind. 

When I’m like this I just want to sleep all the time and live in this ideal world where everything is nice and everyone gets along and even though I’ve got this lovely life, I sometimes just feel like it’s not real.

88,Looking for reason(s) to live,"Hi, 38F here. I was diagnosed with quiet BPD last year, also have a history of OCD, PTSD, generalized anxiety, and depression. I’m high functioning but have been going through a major bout of depression for about the past month. Feelings of emptiness and desire to die are pervasive and began around age 4-5. I go to therapy weekly and treat my symptoms with daily MMJ and occasional psilocybin.

In my latest therapy session, it was suggested that I need to find motivation to live based on “permanence”. My therapist and I both recognize that, while the structure of daily activities gets me through the day most times, I still lack an overall goal/reason to prevent me from ending my life prematurely. When asked what type of reason I might find, she said that it is up to me to discover that and I am experiencing a mental block to finding out what my purpose is, for lack of a better word. Have any of you out there been able to find a real reason to live beyond career goals, raising a family, or financial milestones? I want to learn to cope with this better but I’m really at a loss here. 

For reference, I’m financially secure, have a supportive family and plenty of friends, no desire to have children, and a complicated situationship that admittedly causes most of my acute issues with BPD.

89,Behaviour I can’t figure out,"I do this thing to my partner where I try to tell them what they are or what they should be thinking. I’ll tell them I treat them great, they should be grateful etc and anyone would be lucky to be with me but then I will somehow counteract it then with something I say.
My partner will say it’s almost like transference, I’ll say various insensitive things, it’s not like i’m shouting or being mean but i’m totally unaware that i’m doing it in the moment. 
My partner will try to explain what i’m doing but struggles and gets confused in the moment.
I’ll make excuses for the behaviour like “it was just banter I didn’t think it would upset you” 

I’m really trying to figure out why I do it and identify what i’m doing/what it could be but i’m struggling with it. I feel a huge intense amount of guilt for it and it’s very scary not even being aware of this behaviour when i’m doing it. 
I’m thinking maybe it’s some weird way of me coping, creating my own reality etc.
During these moments I’ll feel like i’m the one that’s been done wrong not the other way around or that I haven’t done anything wrong so it can be very confusing for me. 
My partner says I do it more/when i’m not doing so good mentally and she’s the only person I do it to. Neither of us can figure it out.

Does anybody know what this behaviour could be and where it’s potentially coming from? I’d like to eradicate this behaviour as I really do want to be a good person and not hurt the person I love the most.",1711027682.0,False,4,3,arienoftheram,None,1bk6iv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bk6iv3/behaviour_i_cant_figure_out/
90,Attempting to date after a year of isolation,"I paused my life last year, I reached my lowest and couldn't handle anything. Left my job, avoided all men, broke bonds with a lot of good friends and last month also ended things with my FP/bestfriend of six years. I have been in complete isolation for a year now after diagnosed with BPD. 

I have PCOS as well and I can see some improvement only now, I'm slowly coming out of my shell and meeting new people, attending events. I feel extremely lonely and scared to give people a chance again, fully aware I may ruin everything because of my obsessive needs to over give and get hurt. 

I'm also liking a man I met at the gym, we are from different countries, I'm from a conservative family so I see no future. He doesn't have a job, but claims to have one in his dad's business. He's 28 and I'm 26. He follows Tate and pages like hoodville on Instagram. But he's sweet to me, consistent, and is looking for something long term, believes in marriage and wants children. 

Am i getting played. I don't know If I'm ready to handle such things. It really affected my entire mental and physical health last time. I haven't hugged anyone in a year ... And I can't even dare to do anything casual. I need an extremely stable and understanding partner, will I survive.. will I get hurt..

91,Trauma Dream,"So I'm sure most of you know BPD and trauma are linked. I have PTSD from a number of things throughout my life, and as a consequence I get nightmares. They're always awful, my body somehow manages to make me actually feel pain during them, and they always play out in the same dark and smoky cinematic way. 

Last night I had one, but this one was new. Long story short I had a dream I had a mental breakdown, impulsively cheated on my fiance and then killed myself by hurling myself repeatedly into a brick wall in my office. 

I woke up in tears, yelling and shaking. My head hurt and I felt like I was going to vomit. That all to familiar ""I am a monster and need to hide my mental illness"" fear came up and I was so racked with guilt. 

The thing is my mental health hasn't been bad perse. I have BPD so its never great, but it wasn't awful. 

I have been so stoic all day, I feel like I might start disassociating at any moment, and my guilt is eating me alive. Cheating on the love of my life who has been here to support me through everything and then killing myself... I just can't.

95,"How do I stop an addiction to a toxic person without breaking down entirely again?
","
I've always had relationships that made me go ""insane"", awfully high highs and low lows and never understood why am I like that, until I was finally diagnosed a few months ago.

However I'm still waiting for therapy and can't seem to manage myself properly.

I had a toxic relationship as always and it seemed to give me the highest highs so far - what he says, the sex we had, just overall his energy, it was all a huge fixation for me and the source of euphoria. When it went downhill I hit the lowest lows in my life and that's a big thing considering that I've been mentally ill since childhood and have other diagnoses as well.

I was usually good at not expressing my reactions towards other people, they just ruin me. So in this situation I have someone who's hurt me deeply and who has been  for the past months a source of basically anguish I would say.

However now he's back and acting all nice and I'm all euphoric again. Life makes sense and I feel alive and everything feels so good and easy. When he was gone it was all just dark and I felt either  like I don't exist or shouldn't exist.

I know it can't last and I'm gonna crash down so hard again. But I can't afford to have that happen again. My uni and work has suffered because of the breakdown I had over the first breakup and if that happens again I'm so so screwed. I don't have access to my psychiatrist as I'm in a foreign land and I'm waiting still for online therapy. I'm alone here and if I crash down I'm just alone in the void.

I'm so happy now but in the back of my mind  I know im doomed.

How do I untangle this without being on rock bottom again? I know we don't have a future I'm just hopelessly addicted.

96,scared ive ruined the love of my life,"hi, i’m seeking support and advice for my situation right now because i feel extremely lost and don’t know where to go from here

for about a year now i had been together with who i considered to be the love of my life. and i can tell it’s not just me being obsessed and idealistic like i usually am, i finally found someone who i can truly trust and love wholly and purely and they just feel like home. i admit that like all relationships there are things to work on, especially as we’re both just in our early 20’s, but i’ve noticed recently that even with the endless love and understanding they give me as well as absolutely no reason to not trust them, i am still extremely anxious and insecure and jealous to no end, and ironically it’s been getting worse the closer i feel to them

i’ve been realizing especially with how great things had been in our relationship that i really do need to work on my trauma, bpd, and similar mental health issues, and well the guilt from still feeling the way i do all came to a head recently and i ended up splitting on them bad one night, and it fully dawned on me that i just am not healed or stable enough to carry on like this.

so now i’m here, single again, and feeling awful because i had never been with such an amazing person in such a safe relationship. and while they promised they would wait for me to work on myself, i’m scared for my life that i’ve ruined my chances with them and i’ll never get to be with them again. i don’t know where to go from here and i don’t know how to deal with this fear of losing them forever, as well as now having to cope with the lack of contact and love and attention from them (contact is not on the table because it just makes me panic harder)

97,I regret opening up,"This is a long one sorry i just felt i had to explain everything and give full context.

To start off, ive been very open with my work (bosses and colleagues) that i do have mental health issues the main issue being bpd. 
However, at work ive always seemed to act fine as i mirror happier peoples emotions to appear more approachable as i work in the health sector with patients.
My issue started 4 days ago on Saturday night, my works Christmas party. Weeks if not months before hand 7 of us agreed to meet at work before we headed out as we was closed for the weekend as it would be cheaper fo us to share the cost of a mini bus than to all buy taxis individually, and all agreed to meet at 5.
 Whilst getting ready 2 pulled out, 1 saying she wasnt coming to the entire event  1 decided she wanted to meet us there. Then, minutes later 2 more said they was going to be extremely late and may or may not meet us there  leaving me and 2 others to meet at work. Which was fine the 3 of us ordered food and had 1 drink while hyping ourselves us to meet up with the 2 other practices my bosses own for the joint Christmas party. 7 pm rolls around and the 2 extremely late colleages turn up and we all head out 30 minutes to our destination. 
The 5 of us walk in, our bosses their wives and the other practices staff was already there who we all where very unfamiliar with. Most of us instantly got weird vibes from them and we tried not to let this ruin out night. 
After a few pre drinks at this bar, we all head across the road for our meal and evening entertainment. We sat down at our table and all most instantly, i felt a complete shift in my mood and i was almost instantly in a state of paranoia and anger.
Over the course of the meal 2 of my closes work friends (the ones who met me at work) knew something was wrong and pulled me aside multiple times but i couldn't explain how i was feeling as at the time i didnt quite understand. After trying to have this conversation for atleast 30 minutes we head back to our table have a drink and try and mingle with some of our other work colleges from other pratices. During this, a women from my pratice asked me a questions (which i cant disclose as its even longer than this to explain) and that sent me into deeper paranoia and anger and im having to try hold face the entire night. I leave about an hour after.
The next 2 day i still in this ""episode"" and now having awful panic attacks but wrap my head around what it was that i was feeling. 
Then tuesdsy (today) if my first fay back to work after this. I go in even through i really didnt want to. I hold face i mirror emotions and im doing okay. I start work and im working with my bosses wife and she also saw that i was 'not myself' Saturday and asked if i was feeling better. I explained to her that i was suffering with my mental health quite badly and im unsure what triggered it but im trying to work through it. She asked me if i wanted to talk about it. I wanted to explain my thoughts to her as she is my bosses wife, senior member of staff and thought she would be one of the best people to speak to.
So i told her how i felt.
I told her that i felt as if someone had walked into the restaurant, set off a bomb and i was the only person that survived, but in top of that i was still able to see and speak to everyone who died. I said it was a mixture of scared an paranoid that we was going to die,  the shock, anger and greif that everyone had just died infront of me ( the restaurant was packed had easily 200/300 other people in there) and confusion to why i could see and talk to everyone as if nothing happened. That i was walking and licing in some sort of daze that every negative emotion wass heighten, that i was scared for my life and i felt like i had to watch everyones move because i couldnt trust anyone as they could be the killer.
The look on her face, i knew instantly then that i regretted even opening my mouth. She looked confused but also as if i was a monster.
I dont know if i will ever live past this day and forget that look i got.
Am i a monster?
Am i juat unwell?
I dont know how i feel on top of all this.
Am i over reacting?
Am i still in a state of paranoia?",1703031457.0,False,8,9,AdditionalArcher4756,None,18mguqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/18mguqh/i_regret_opening_up/
98,Splitting with favourite person and intense emotions.,"Hello to anyone reading this.
I was diagnosed with BPD and depression in 2021.
My dad passed away in 2013 and he was physically and verbally abusive to my mum but was very loving and caring towards me.
I was in a relationship with a guy who turned out to be physically and abusive to me as well so I had broken up and got into another relationship in 2022.
With this new guy, I felt much better mentally and started gaining weight. Everything was ok but I cheated on him after 18days of being in a relationship so I felt very guilty and bad about myself and confessed after 6 months to open up and be honest. It was once and I regretted and repented a lot and never did anything like that again.
But I found out that he cheated on me too after 3 months I confessed to him. He had a fake account too where he was sexting and complimenting girls anonymously.
Long story short, I forgave him and tried to move on with everything and accept whatever it is and stay happy with him because I really love him.

Things have been hard for me because I split a lot and I wish I was different, thought differently.
I live with a single mum and I have been trying my best to do well in my studies and so far my studies are going good but I am so tensed because of the things that have been happening in my life rn.
I miss my dad too cause I never spoke to him due to anxiety.
I regret a lot of things and wish things were different.

About a year ago, I dated a guy named Tim. It was a rocky relationship and I cannot claim that I was the only victim. We weren’t good for each other and I am willing to acknowledge my fault.

On the other hand, every few months or so Tim will contact me again after he dumped me. The first time he messaged me for me to delete a photo of us on my facebook. Which I had ignored due to the fact he is posting terrible things about me online calling me all sorts of names, etc. I eventually deleted it after he berated and dmed me some more just so I could keep the peace. The second time he dmed me, it was apologizing for everything he has done and asking for reconciliation. I wasn’t moved on and was thrilled he asked for a redo. A week later he had suddenly went cold, after I thought everything was alright. There were no arguments. He continued to spread rumors about me and ruin my reputation at the school we went to together, and I had made the decision to continue online.
It’s been about a half a year since then and we have been no contact. Recently, Tim had gotten expelled from school due to trafficking. Today, I had gotten a strange text saying “I miss you”. I assumed it was my friend playing a joke so I resumed saying it back, and so forth. I asked who it was and he said “You know who. do you still think of me?”. I had decided to not respond for a while and continue to say “why did you do everything you did?”. He replied with “I thought it was the right thing to do. I'll be better this time.

101,Has anyone ever taken the DES assessment while receiving therapy?,"Recently, I’ve experienced a severe mental breakdown - to cut a long story short, the experience resulted in several hospitalisations and taking time off work for 2 and a half month to the present date. 

The aftermath of this was me receiving a care coordinator and psychologist, who have decided that given my recent experiences, they want to do an ‘extended assessment’ to clarify my diagnosis. I have been diagnosed with BPD for close to 3 years now and when initially diagnosed, I did not have to take the DES assessment. 

DES stands for Dissociative Experiences Scale, which is essentially a test of 28 questions relating to dissociative tendencies that you rate between 0-100% based on the regularity of your experience with the posed scenario. 

This is not anything I have ever been asked to do before, and I am unsure if this is a typical part of a BPD diagnosis. I have made peace with my diagnosis and being presented with the DES has sky rocketed my anxiety that it might not have been right all along. 

The last thing I want to do is send myself down the rabbit hole by googling to try and find any form of clarity on this, and I would be immensely grateful if anyone could shed any input on this or if they have any experience (personal or not) with the DES assessment.

102,I think I've destroyed my relationship with the only person in my life that really gave a shit about me.,"I don't want to go into our full history, it's long and also obviously personal. We both struggle with our mental health and seem to clash when it comes to communication. For years I've tried to tell him how I feel, nip hurt feelings In the bud and talk them out, but it never happens. 

Best I can describe his communication style is avoidant which is honestly probably the worst for someone with BPD. When we have problems he just never says anything about it and acts like whatever it is never happened. we've been together and known each other for a really long time so of course some major issues and hurdles have cropped up throughout the years, but since he's been unwilling to we've never talked any of it through, and I can't live like that. 

The past couple of years my anger and resentment from all that never was addressed has been building over until now where it's reached maximum boiling point. He even told me that he thinks I'm not a good person sometimes, and hearing that felt like total despair. I literally just curled up In the fetal position and cried, then sleeping pilled myself to sleep. 

The thing is I don't even think he's wrong. I'm hard on myself. Extremely hard on myself, and I think I am hard on everyone around me. I can't stop thinking that I'm so irreversibly fucked up and horrible. Now I see every mistake I've ever made with him even as I continue to make them. 

I don't know what I'm expecting writing this, I know it isn't interesting to read and probably nothing anyone would have any feedback about. I want to at least get a hold of myself and stop being bitter and lashing out. It isn't an excuse, but I don't even know how to be better than what I am. 

And I know as I am I'm not fit to have any type of relationship. Not just romantic but I shouldn't and, well don't have, friendships and I have fractured relationships with family. I used to think the trouble with family relationships was because my family members have their own mental health stuff going on, but I mean what I say when I say I'm not fit for any type of relationship with other people. 

My partner is a good person unlike me and very loyal and caring. I think he's reached his breaking point because of how I am. I don't want to hurt him anymore. It's like a punch to the stomach to see him tired, hurt, and unhappy. Which is how he looks more than not the past year. so I'm going to end things and the way he was talking to me last night (the first time he's really opened up in forever) sounds like that's what he wants anyway. 

He was saying things like ""this is why it won't work out between us"" basically already calling the relationship dead. Really saw him as such a pure soul and I've gone and done the opposite of what I set out to do. Because in the beginning I was all about doing anything and everything I could to make him happy. 

The crazy thing is that he only started to actually love me when these attempts stopped. 

Maybe spending life alone isn't as terrifying as Ive always imagined. Maybe this is just how it's supposed to be for me.

(not really a dog person don't understand them much) Well his response was to stop taking care of him while he's at work then.

106,My boyfriend broke up with because I kept having episodes and I know it’s my fault. ,"Me and my (ex)boyfriend have been together on and off for about a year now. We’ve had amazing times together and I’ve been working (not so hard) on my mental health. Recently I’ve stopped going to therapy because my therapist is very old (I’m 20f) and doesn’t really understand me. I feel like I can’t be honest with her because of that. Anyways. The other day we were having a really good week and decided to see each other on Sunday, we woke up early, went to the Perot Museum in Dallas, went out to lunch, had some fun in a hotel room and then it was time to go home. Well when we got back to my parents house (we don’t live together but that’s a whole other story) my mom had given me the garage code so o could go inside and relax as I had work the next morning (I ended up calling off due to the emotional state I was in) but it didn’t work. No matter what code I tried, how hard or soft I pushed- nothing worked. At this point I was so frustrated I couldn’t take it anymore and started going into an episode. I called my mom and started crying saying it wasn’t working then getting very angry and wanting to leave. My (ex)boyfriend started getting a little worried and said that he needs to take some space and he thinks it’s the best idea for him to go home as my parents would be back soon. I ran after him and stopped him from getting in the car. We had an argument and I kicked his front bumper and his front drivers door (I didn’t leave ANY dents or scratches) which made him freak out more. I stood in front of his car when he tried to leave and begged him to get out of the car which he ended up doing just to give me a hug. I screamed at him as he drove away. I don’t know why I’m like this. I don’t know why I was born like this. My heart is in a million pieces right now and I’m so lost.

107,I am not a monster,"I am slipping away into a very dark place. I am so scared. \
Me and my partner have been together for nearly 2 years. I love him to death. He has his own mental issues and I have mine. We’ve both done wrong to each other and I’ve learned to admit mine and I apologize sincerely to him. \
I am trying to hard to improve, sorry if this post is all over the place I am a mess at the moment.\
So basically he told me he joined a reddit support group for loved ones with bpd. I was so happy to hear that because I thought he was trying to see the world trough my eyes and look for support. \
And then I looked up said subreddit and I cannot shake this panic. That place is not a support group, unless you are leaving/planing to leave someone in your life with bpd. \
Now that is what’s got me spiralling. I cannot lose him, he means the world to me and I just want to get better for myself, so I can do right by him. \
He hardly believes me and I am so scared he will finally ditch me after reading through that sub. \
Please, I need some support. I am not a monster, I don’t want to cause him pain. \
There’s so much more to it than I am able to write now I feel so detached from everything. I just want to be loved. I never wished to have this trauma inflicted upon me by my abusive parents, I just need to be loved. \
My thoughts are so warped I am so lost and so afraid of what I might do, I need him to see I am not a villain, I am sick, but I am seeking help. I cannot cope with this life any further if I lose this connection I have. \
I am so scared, he joined that sub with the best intentions and now I am terrified he will just accept his life is better without me and go through with a breakup. \
I know I am capable of so much more. I just need someone to stay, I am so alone, so tired of fighting to be loved and understood. I hate this illness so much, I don’t know what to do, I guess I am just looking for some support here. Thank you if you read through this.

109,how do i have a normal relationship?,"So sorry this is a bit long but if anyone can give me any advice I'd appreciate it!
For some context - I have BPD and my boyfriend does not. He has some other mental health struggles but they infrequently cause any tension or issues in our relationship and none are personality disorders.
I started dating my boyfriend about 8 months ago and this is the healthiest/most stable partner I've ever had. 
In all of my previous relationships, conflict was always resolved in unhealthy ways like screaming or ghosting, and the relationships tended to be very intense and short-lived. Unfortunately, a lot of those behaviors and tendencies are still hardwired in me.
In this relationship, almost all the issues we have are caused or worsened by me escalating things out of instinct/habit.
I tend to get insecure about his feelings towards me, usually triggered by small things like a shift in tone or a perceived lack of interest, and I vaguely ask for constant reassurance (things like “Do you still want to be with me, do you still love me” etc). When his answer isn't perceived as “good enough” to me I lash out and accuse him of not caring about or loving me.
I’ve gotten him to the point where he feels like nothing he can say is good enough for me and as a result, he’s stopped putting as much effort into his reassurance, unintentionally worsening the situation.
I don’t know how to stop needing so much reassurance, or lashing out when I don’t get it. Asking as frequently as I do is coming off as accusatory and the last thing I want to do is lead him to believe he’s doing something wrong when I ask to be reassured, it’s nothing he’s done it's just my own thought process freaking me out. 
I’m currently in DBT therapy but it’s an incredibly slow process and I’m worried that he won’t be able to put up with the way I act for much longer. He’s always relatively calm, patient, and forgiving with me but I pull the same thing over and over and I feel like I'm pushing him farther away each time when all I want is to make sure we’re still close.",1713339248.0,False,3,1,Weird-Pepper8335,None,1c63vle,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1c63vle/how_do_i_have_a_normal_relationship/
110,Advice -,"I don't know how to start this. I need some guidance and perhaps support, but I feel I have completely fucked up my life. Rewind two years ago; I was living in a metropolitan area and working for a company that appeared to have a great trajectory and opportunities for travel. I had a tribe of friends that were smart, supportive and loving. Unfortunately, I did come out of a turbulent breakup, unleashing my most severe BPD symptoms. I moved back to my hometown to continue working remotely, a blessing in normal circumstances. From there, things started spiralling; I was in a messy family dynamic, including being around a very mentally ill family member who came to live with us. His verbal abuse and mean nature were triggering. I could go on about his mental health and the domino effects it causes my nuclear family and me.  

Compiled with the massive change to my living situation, I was triggered by my parents and their shortcomings and their current living situation, making me feel completely insecure in my ability to thrive. 

I was isolated physically and remotely, using marijuana as a coping mechanism. I didn't have the same support system withdrawing from loved ones and cutting people off for no good reason. Until recently, it felt like I was completely broken inside, being held together with an eggshell-like body embracing me in some physical normality. I have since been on better medications and feel like a whole person, not using marijuana and eating regularly but lacking a routine. 

In January, I was let go from my job due to covid and the lack of revenue. My rejection sensitivity went off, and I withdrew and did not collect my last paycheque from work and have not worked since or collected social assistance. I am broke. I had built up my credit and savings until then, I could kind of live off my savings. I didn't think I could find a job, feeling like I should have thrived in a better position by now, and now I feel like I fucked myself over in every way. I've cut off all of my tribe of friends, not working, and feel fucking lost. 

I know I need to reach out to my old employer, apologize, collect my last pay cheque, try and get social security, continue applying for jobs and reach out and apologize to friends in the hope I can build my life back up. But I don't know if any of that is possible.

112,Argument with my fp help,"My bf (25m) and I (21f) had an argument about an expired disney subscription. I asked him what happened to it and his immediate response was “you didn’t pay for it and I reminded you but you still didn’t so I gave up” I got really upset and sad because he immediately blamed me and I payed for disney plus all his stuff (accidentally) on apple for months which was a lot of money so what he said is not even true. When I got upset he got even more angry at me and said I keep getting stuck on one thing and basically made my reaction seem out of the blue and like I was overreacting. This kept going for a while with him just screaming at me and me trying to defend myself and saying it’s basically gaslighting until finally he came at me for my mental health and said “here we go again with you crying, you always do this”. 
I’m so confused and hurt by this and I don’t even know if it’s my fault or if I’m actually just overreacting. I don’t think it’s okay to blame me and put me down when I payed for disney plus all his stuff for months.

But I knew it was going to be horrible like every other time. 
They do 5 hour sessions and for some reason I just dissociate after the 3 hour mark and completely shut down and end up having a panic attack after not too long, that ends up with me locking myself in the bathroom to avoid the music, talking, dice sounds etc. I feel like throwing up and hurting myself and dying all at the same time.

I just need to vent, to maybe find others who can't handle ""fun"" events. It just hurts so fucking much because I want to be involved and I love my friends and stuff. But then I just break down and mentally and even physically can't handle it. Literally no matter what I do, no matter how many breaks they give me.

I just feel like a scared child that wants to go home. A baby that needs to be treated as fragile or else ill break. Which isn't wrong. It just fucking kills me deep down that thats what I am.

114,Not really sure how to proceed,"Long story short, I’ve been seeing this therapist for a few months. She’s nice but she comes off as kind of a ditz and crosses boundaries. As an example, our first session: At the end of the meeting, she said that she usually closes with a hug but I don’t have to if it crosses my boundaries. Well I told her I love hugs and so we did. My mental health has slowly been on the decline as of late and I’ve been splitting a lot on my boyfriend. I’m really in need of support and have therapy every Tuesday at 3pm. Well these past couple sessions, while we normally meet in person, she’s told me she’s had to travel for meetings, so we will have to do telehealth, which is okay and I’m willing to do that. She just sent me an email, granted it’s enough time for me to shift around my plans, to let me know that she isn’t going to be able to make our meeting but we can reschedule for later on in the week or for three weeks out, because she had to change her travel plans. Then she summated by saying “I wasn’t sure about my decision but I’m so glad I made it.” I’m not sure why but that sounded incredibly selfish to me and made me really upset. I did not have a good holiday, I had a long day of dysregulation, splitting and sleeping to cope with deeply embedded feelings from complex ptsd. So…I’ve about had it with this therapist and I’m wondering if I need to find a new one. Feel free to ask me to elaborate.

We’ve been doing this dance for about 4 years now and have gone to couples therapy before I learned of my bpd symptoms. 

As a solution to all this he wants us to be broken up, for me to accept that, but for us to continue being intimate, and living together and working on our mental health but as “best friends”.

120,Needing support,"Hello!
This is my first post ever on Reddit. I need support from people who also have BPD. 

I am 22f and I was properly diagnosed with BPD last year although I suspected it for a long time. I always had troubles with impulsivity, deppresion and emotional Control. Last year I fully realize how bad I am even though I was in therapy for almost two years at this time. It started when my boyfriend broke up with me. I Had a relationship before but this was first more long term. We were living together for couple months. 

I am acknowlegding that we had problems on his side, but I was more impulsive abusive and awful, because my mental Health was awful. I just got out from my parents house, was adjusting to new work, new city and was dealing with relative that Had dementia and unfourtunally died at the end of 2021. I am not saying this to demish what I did which included intensive splitting, arguing, trying to keep it through being FwB even though it was hurting us both etc. This land me in group therapy which I couldn't handle, because I really had a hard time hearing critism and taking full accountability for what I did. 

My question is does anybody else deal with a guilt after being abusive partner or is afraid of repeating the pattern? If so does it get easier and can you fully recover from it and be a good partner?

I am in New relationship since March this year and I am just afraid. Especially that It is long distance.. I don't want to hurt anybody else or myself. The guilt is sometimes overwhelming.

121,How to tell between splitting/senseless anger vs anger that makes total sense?,"Idk if I'm wording this right, English isn't my first language so bear with me.

So for context, me and my partner are both diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder, so we have a hard time admitting our faults when we fight, or just being patient with each other. We both have abusive traits in the relationship and I'm not proud of that.

But I got ZERO mental health knowledge, so I don't really know how to tell when I'm wrong for screaming, contradicting, ignoring, being angry at my partner and when I'm right for doing so (as in: he did something that will spite an angry response in ANYONE). 

Yesterday, his sister brought us some chinese fried rice since its my favorite food with some fries. We're Costarrican, so this isn't everyday food btw, this shits special.
As it was cold, and my boyfriend didn't show any interest in it since it ""looked weird"", I started cleaning HIS familys house, doing some leftover dishes, wiping the tables, cleaning the floors a little... so I could peacefully sit and eat the fried rice. I mean, I'm getting a little treat from his sister, might as well treat her by cleaning their house.
I was finishing everything up, I even air fried the fries separately so they wouldnt taste like microwave... and surprise, my boyfriend is now besides me, looking at the food with hungry eyes...... I thought to myself: ""Nah, he wouldn't eat the fries, he just ate a bunch of food..."". I washed a last dish and I turn and boom, one fry left on the plate. I caught him red handed.
I would've broken up with him for this. Like, dissapeared forever, for a bunch of fries... 

I was so angry, I wanted to scream, I felt a pressure in my chest, my eyes were crying before i even processed whatever happened... I wanted to die over some fries. And this happens all. the. time. over a thousand other things... 
I ended up angry for an hour or two until I stopped being mad and I asked him to say sorry to me because he clearly saw how much it hurt me... but its such a stupid thing, why am I even treating someone poorly over these stupid reasons???? What can I do?? How do I tell when I should be mad or when not to be mad, especially when I'm angry with my partner over past things that genuinely matter and hurt me? Even if i supposedly forgave him, I still bring those thoughts forth when we fight!!

I received my diagnosis, I started to work on myself, I had a job that paid well that I somewhat liked, am engaged to the sweetest man I've ever met, and am moving into a new house.

Yesterday I was fired from my job. I've never been fired before andy work ethic has always been one of my best achievements. Suddenly, the thing I was most proud of doing for myself was taken from me. My fiance is doing his best to convince me that it'll all be okay. I've been sending in job applications and I already had a temporary job in the works that starts on August 12th.

But then it got a bit creepy / flirty . And I probably let it go on longer than it should. Also, he was married and had just had a baby! 

Long story short, I left that job , continued to message him for a few months then cut it off cause I knew deep down it wasn't right. 

However I know find myself missing talking to him cause I realise how alone I feel and that I actually have no one to talk to. 

But I know now he's in a better place mentally than when we were talking and I think I worked out that he was just using me to flirt with cause he'd just had a baby and I don't think he was getting the attention from his wife. And obviously he doesn't need me now.

I've tried cbt several times and I've never ""completed"" it some of the times there were internal errors, some times I moved out of the area and sometimes I was the issue and found cbt so harmful to myself I had to stop for the good of my health. 

I have been asking for dbt for years now but because I'm ""not in an active crisis"" they won't refer me to it. I was seeking help yet again today and the medical professional likened the fact I haven't ""completed"" cbt to ""not completing a dose of antibiotics"" and that leaving the ""dose unfinished means it can never help, so we don't actually know if cbt doesn't help"" they said this was ""tough love"" and  referred me bakc to a psychologist which I'm grateful for, however I'm worried I'm just going to be given cbt again and not have my worries listened to.
Does anyone have any insight or similar experiences with this? I'm in the UK specifically going through NHS Scotland. 

I'm trying to get better so I don't fuck up yet another relationship after stumbling across the nicest and most understanding human. He doesn't deserve the bs bpd can bring and I've done my best healing and understanding my bpd on my own but I struggle still with abandonment.

125,How can I help myself?,"First I want to apologize for the long post that you're about to read but I'm really losing my sanity at this point.

I (f 21) was dating a guy (20) for about two months, he was a virgin and I was his first ever , everything was going so so well , we are very compatible and I really liked him a lot and still do like him , he also liked me a lot , until..

Before we had sex for the first and last time ever he had talked to me about STDs and I told him that he has nothing to worry about because I have never had an STD , so two weeks later we have unprotected sex , and it was really really good , ten days later he started experiencing some symptoms like a burning sensation when he pees , white or clear discharge, his penis was red and swollen, and he was going crazy and he was very very anxious and scared (rightfully so) he went to a doctor and the doctor told him that it's probably gonorrhea and he told him to start with the medication that he prescribed to him after he got a test , the test came back negative, and I also did all the STDs tests and all of them came back negative as well . (For the record we are syrians and we live in syria , so we are very tight on money and the whole process of going to doctors and taking all the std tests was very dangerous because any kind of sexual activity before marriage is not okay here) .

This guy is now convinced that I gave him something and he doesn't want anything to do with me anymore, and he keeps calling me reckless (which I know I am I was diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago but my parents refused to believe it and didn't get me medication or treatment) .

My problem is that I was also too ignorant to believe it (because mental health is not really a thing in Syria) and now I feel like I desperately want him to stay in my life because I didn't do anything wrong, and I feel like my world is collapsing, and I know that I need to go to therapy and get treatment but I don't have any money, therapy is very expensive here and I don't know how to cope anymore, I truly saw something in him , and I feel like shit for losing him as a friend and as a lover , I didn't want things to go that way at all , and I don't know what to do.",1715932579.0,False,1,0,Unfair_Solution_2317,None,1ctzrvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ctzrvj/how_can_i_help_myself/
126,Struggling to survive,"If anyone has come kind advice or support that would be appreciated. 1:57am
I'm 18 and struggles with bpd and starting a few days ago, I've sunken into a battle of self sabotaging once again. The week before , I was doing really really well. I'm not sure what happened. I mean my mindset was well. But I've been sick for a long time, mentally and physically. I feel like my body is going to just going to deteriorate into nothing. January, I was 118lbs, that was a big deal for me because before that I had also fell into an anorexic depression but was able to recover enough. The first time it happened, I fell from 126 to 106lbs. I was able to recover and made it to 118lbs, but then then fell again ever lower to 94 last time I checked.(maybe a month ago) I don't think I could get on a scale anymore. I'm horrified to see the number because I know it's probably lower. I've tried to get help. 2 months ago I was referred to a gyno for missing 2 periods. The appointment was supposed to be yesterday but got canceled. I was also just recently moved to a new therapist at mental health too so I had to go 2 and a half weeks without mental health and I only had about 5 sessions since I started. I have an appointment today, but I don't think I'll be able to make it. It's at 1:15 and the only one who could drive me is my boyfriend, but he promised his sister he'd babysit at 1:30, and I forgot to remind him about my appointment. (Plus I had a self sabotage episode yesterday about my gyno appointment being canceled I said I wasn't going to any other appointments, including mental health. but I think I said I didn't mean it and would think about it, but I honestly don't remember, I forget so much all the time now and I don't know why) but I thought about it and decided I wanted to go, mostly to cry to my therapist about feeling so horrible and disgusted with my unhealthy self. I feel like I'm stuck. I want to get better and I feel like I'm trying as hard as I can. It's hard. I can't control my mental health all the time, but I feel like I should have at least been able to control my physical health enough, looking back on this year so far, I though I was surviving, but lately when I look at myself, and how I feel, I feel like I'm dying.

127,"My parents keep telling me they hope i off myself, I might as well do it","I am a 22 years old female. I’ve been independent as i could be since i turned 18. I have a job + i am in college and basically do everything on my own so i am not a burden or anything. I’ve been diagnosed with Bpd, severe anxiety and depression 2 years ago and I’ve been regularly seeing a therapist and trying my best to overcome my trauma. 

Since i was a little girl as little as 5-6 years old, my mom always talked about how she wanted to abort me but couldn’t and how she wished she never had me. Through years of emotional and physical abuse, i tried to hang on to the glimpse of love and care she had for me but to no avail. I tried to build a relationship with her even when i became an adult, i tried my absolute best to show her it doesn’t have to be that way and we could be very close to each other and how despite everything i still loved her and for a while it was working, we became sort of best friends. 

Then she has these episodes where she suddenly gets back to her old abusive ways. These last couple of months she has been worse in terms of how she abuses me. Every time i see her or talk to her she tells me how she just wishes I die or get murdered and she wishes she can do it herself choking me and watching the life drain out of me and she gave me so much details on how she would love to do it, or for me to off myself and make it easier on her. I’ve been more anxious and panicking a lot more lately and it doesn’t help that i am under a lot of stress working a full time job and managing university at the same time my schedule is almost 80 hours a week and i just can’t handle it all, i might as well just make her wishes come true and just off myself. The only reason why i can’t do it is because i have friends in my life that are literally my family and my whole support system and I can’t put them in the position of losing me but man i have no hope for any future in all my years I’ve been mentally ill and it never got better or easier.

128,Major misunderstanding with therapist,"I am not really sure if this is the correct thread and hope this post make sense. F 28 and previously i reached out to my therapist when i had a breakdown and on the weekend. My therapist doesn't work on weekends.. If it is not an ""true emergency ""    then i can not reach out. I learned this the hard way and set clear boundaries since then. It is very hard for me with my  mental health diagnosis . 

Yesterday we had a phone session and my therapist had plans to go away for the holiday's. Last night i was writing my notes/list for my future therapy apts. It was very late at night and i unfortunately sent them to her. It was an honest mistake. The words of the  email ilude to the ideal of hurting onself. I can see how the email came off that way . I had no intention of feeling this way and i had no idea i even sent that email to her. I woke up to emails, text and missed calls from my therapist.  I called her immediately as i woke up and  i said im okay and I kept apologizing.  She was going away on her trip today so she hung up quickly after i said i was okay and it was not meant for her. I feel so bad and i know that my therapist will probably have a huge talk with me when we meet in the new year. She then sent me another email tonight with  crisis information and stated that if it not a ""true emergency ""to cal that crisis info. She obviously had to send that email to back herself up which is totally understandable.  

The email she sent ""  I
will have my phone available for true emergencies only so that I can have my own self-care to be a great therapist for my clients when I return. ""

 I am at fault and should be more careful next time. I guess i will just write my notes not on emails.... that was my stupidy. I been feeling guilty all day and will probably roomnating until our session.

129,Invalidating my BPD and experiences. Is this common/normal,"So I just recently got medically diagnosed with borderline a few months ago. I also recently found this sub (as well as BPD memes) and I can relate to quite a few of the things I see but I always feel like it's wrong saying I have these issues. I know I'm stigmatizing and generalizing here, but even though I do have my problems it's not too the point I can't hold a job (at least I think. Maybe my BPD has gotten worse and I just haven't discovered yet, I have an interview next week). But to be direct, there are also some things I can't relate with. I know everyone's experience is different but even though I've been officially diagnosed it just feels wrong to say I have it after hearing other people's history and experience with it. Is this also a common thing for people with BPD? Am I alone in these thoughts?

130,Struggling a bit with a breakup and overall hard life.,"Edit: I’m sorry for not responding to the comments; I deeply appreciate the support.  I’ve been really trying not to panic over my situation and working on not being homeless.  I know that I cannot support myself financially because of my mental illness, and my mental illness + trauma (from not just the breakup but a LOT of other things back to back over the last two years) cannot get better with the looming threat of homelessness and lack of proper medical attention.   I’ve just sorta been unhinged for days now.  But I’m still here. 



There’s a lot to unpack and if I went into details, this post would be really long and probably unappealing to read (because of length).

I don’t have very many friends and I don’t have any family at all.  My partner broke up with me a few days ago (they had left me at the exact same time last year as well in a way that was extremely traumatic).  

I’m really doing my best to work through my feelings but I only see a therapist once a month and have been back on medication for about two month due to insurance bullshit. 

I don’t want to call a suicide hotline; but I really need someone to talk to, or just check in with me.  Being alone is scary but it really is amplified when you have no skills as an adult and no family.

131,Coping skills for intense emotional pain when feeling abandoned?,"TL;DR: What are some coping skills that you’ve found helpful or therapy techniques or things your therapist or someone has said which are helpful when your FP is going through a rough time and you’re afraid of being abandoned even though you logically don’t think they want to leave you? I’m especially looking for skills I can do anywhere, like while at my retail job or driving. 

My FP has talked to me more since having a death in her family but she still goes quiet fairly often for mental health reasons because her energy for being social gets low. I know she is struggling with her mental health too including some pretty severe issues and she recently reassured me very nicely that she’s always glad to reassure me and deep down I do believe her and believe she doesn’t plan on leaving. It’s just that she hasn’t talked to me AS MUCH as before and when she does talk to me after accidentally doing something that makes me feel abandoned, it’s been taking more reassurance from her to get me to feel confident again. 

Believing deep down she doesn’t want to leave doesn’t stop me from feeling like she is going to drift away from me too just like everyone else I have ever known has done, even though I know logically that her silence is no reflection on how she feels about me and entirely related to her trying to cope with her own issues. 

It hurts me though when she mentions any of her other friends because I feel like she likes them more than me so especially with feeling abandoned already it just makes me feel worse if she talks to me and talks to them. I’ve been hurting so bad lately because I am terrified of her leaving even though logically I think she truly cares and wants to stay but I can’t make myself believe that so I’ve been feeling so overwhelmed and freaking out a lot about this lately. 

Any helpful tips or coping skills I can do on my own? I just asked her for reassurance the other day and I don’t want to do it again already. Besides I want to get better at validating myself instead of always having to ask. 

The last thing I want to do is make her feel burdened by trying to take care of not only her own mental health but mine as well. I really really care about her and I want to do everything I can to avoid being toxic to her in any way. 

Thanks!

Edit: My current coping mechanisms are things like writing or making art about how I feel, trying to get physically comfortable with soft blankets or wearing comforting clothes, daydreaming, or trying to distract myself by cleaning or doing other activities. I also have urges to self harm but I try to do the other things instead to cope.",1593392689.0,False,5,5,pizza4569,None,hhqd1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/hhqd1s/coping_skills_for_intense_emotional_pain_when/

134,My apartment is disgusting and I don’t know where to start,"This is literally my first post on Reddit because I don’t know where to turn. I was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago and I didn’t even know what it was until I got the diagnosis and it does make a lot of sense. Ive been in therapy a lot and gotten psychiatric care as well. 

I’ve always been a pretty messy person. Not in a disgusting way or unsanitary but recently it’s gotten bad. I had kept my studio somewhat decent until my now ex girlfriend and I broke up two weeks ago and I’ve spiraled ever since. With the holidays, my mental health goes in the trash and my apartment was starting to get messy but I just let it build because I couldn’t muster up the energy to clean it. I worked and if I wasn’t working, I was sleeping or binge drinking. Now, I have fruit flies all over the place and it was kind of my wake up call to start cleaning. I have dominos boxes everywhere, McDonald’s bags, clothes and I haven’t done dishes in over two months. Random trash and there’s barely places to walk. I know it’s disgusting and I really want to change things for myself. I know the task is going to be daunting and I have no idea where to start. Even doing dishes takes me awhile because my sink doesn’t have a disposal and I don’t have a dishwasher. So I guess I’m looking for tips on how to get all this done. 

How do I get rid of fruit flies besides obviously throwing away everything attracting them? Do they go away on their own, are traps enough after the house is clean, or do I need a professional? What’s a good way to build a healthy habit of actually keeping the place clean? It’s so bad that I don’t even have people over because of how embarrassed I am. I think the fruit flies have probably been here for two weeks and I’ve been drinking to get through the days and haven’t paid much attention to them, but I’ve been getting sober and more aware of the state I’m living in and desperate to change things. I also cannot afford professional cleaning, they quoted me $480 after a phone call.

135,"an online FP, what do i do?","I have not been diagnosed with BDP but I'm quite sure I have it, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was around 14 years old.

So basically I have a FP (favourite person),  he's one of my online friends, and they've been my FP for a while, at first I thought I liked him but soon realized it's just an obsession. I wanna be with him 24/7 and especially talking to him in VC. He does know that I have BDP because I keep feeding him information about how I feel (for example, I'm jealous of you and X being together most of the time), to him 24/7 and I always second-guess him (you must have snitched to X because you guys are so much closer!), and he seems pretty annoyed with it. He told me it is fine to vent and it was too much. I think it was too much too and I don't want him to be angry at me because I will literally cry if he shows any signs of him being angry, I know it's mentally draining for him but I can't control myself to not tell him. Jealousy is the worst problem I have to deal with, it makes me anxious and sometimes angry, or sometimes I will just burst out crying. It makes me anxious when he's talking with other people and extra angry and sad if he's talking to someone one-on-one, which he rarely talks to me in a VC but sometimes I just wanna hear his voice. I always stalk him 24/7 to see if he's doing something with his friends and I would also stalk his friends if they are both online on discord, if they are both online I would assume that they must be talking to each other and having fun, which makes me more anxious, why would he want to spend time with a mentally broken and a boring human-being? I have way too many expectations for him (he's gonna text me anytime sooon~ I'm waiting!) (He will understand me 100%) (He will comfy me If I say this to him)

Soon I realize that this is getting more unhealthy and unhealthy day by day and I want to do something about it but I'm so helpless,  I'm literally experiencing stomach pain because of anxiety, If this goes on, I'll be at my limits soon. I don't know what to do, every time I talk about this with him I just end up pushing him further and further, and I feel like I overshare too much. He's such a precious and fun person to hang out with and he's kinda understanding too, I don't wanna lose him as a friend. I don't want us to end up blocking each other,  I wanna change, What can I do, or what mindset do I need to have in order to make this a healthy friendship?",1649136213.0,False,8,2,lemoni32,None,twni7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/twni7w/an_online_fp_what_do_i_do/
136,"""Traumatized"" by my worst BPD spiral and breakdown
","First of all, I want to say I know the word trauma is thrown around a lot and here I'm not using it to make a claim I fit the diagnostic criteria for it, just using it in lack of a better descriptor so please don't come for me about that - I'm aware it's likely not the correct usage, just can't think of a better one currently and I think it gets the point across.

This fall and winter I had the worst spiral and breakdown of my entire life, related to a toxic relationship with a FP that also has their share of mental health issues and addictions.

I ended up breaking it off and I moved to another country afterward, which was planned anyway before.

The relationship was ended but we still had contact and it was of course all ups and downs, BUT. My current issue seems to be more with what has already happened rather than what it is now.

I get what I can call ""flashbacks"" of what happened between us, how I felt, how my mind interpreted it at the time, and it just sets me back for the moment, feeling empty and terrifried and in so much pain, again. When I can center myself in the present moment I'm very much aware of the progress I've made, of how this person really doesn't have a place in the life I'm trying to maintain and while my thoughts and feelings aren't ""good"" or even close to normal, they're not unmanageable or terryfing.

When I get a ""flashback"", it feels like I fall into the abyss again and it hurts so bad it makes me bend over at moments. If I didn't know I had BPD, I'd think I was having a heart attack. All the feelings are back and I can't stop my mind from very rapidly producing the ""BPD thoughts"" that devalue myself and life itself to absurdity even though an hour ago I would be more or less stable and thinking in a more balanced way.

I'm supposed to move back to the city where I lived, where it all happened, and it would be a very good choice for me in all aspects of life, however - I'm terryfied of it. I panic when I think about having to go back. Because I know I'll have to pass the places related to all these events during my episode and it makes me feel like it's gonna be twisting the metaphorical knife in my chest that I can't seem to pull out.

What seems to be my problem is not suffering for this person in particular, I feel like what hurts me now is this whole series of events that had me breaking down and having the strongest psychiatric intervention of my life. This period of my life that lasted a few months feels like hell, like I've been sucked into another dimension where out of everything in my life ever, it's only the pain and fear that exists.

I don't even know what would be the right term for what I'm experiencing and have no clue what kind of help to seek for it.

137,having an FP on discord and it's miserable,"Alright, here's the whole story, there's this one guy I met through games and we started talking in discord, he's the first guy who would give me so much attention and he used to kinda long for me (not sure if it was because I'm a top player at the game we both played), I liked it, I become more attached to him when time goes on, but he stops giving me that much attention and I really long for the attention and affection he used to give me and my obsession with him became worse and worse. I told him that I have BDP and he is my favourite person and I keep venting my feelings to him to the point where he's super annoyed but I can't control myself not oversharing, I'm so sick of myself. I felt like our friendship started crumbling that moment I keep oversharing. One of the biggest problem I have to deal with is jealousy, there is one friend he would always play with and talk to, they stay up very late to play games with each other, and my FP never really stay up to talk to me and find excuses to leave early and just don't bother talking me, they seem so close that can be never touched, and the one friend always trying to ruin my image in front of my FP, gossip about me, flexing to me how close they are, I stalk my FP 24/7 and when I know he's playing with that one friend, my heart and stomach starts hurting, I would cry, having the urge to hit something. I mean I get it, that friend is interesting and stuff while I'm boring and annoying. Everyone would've chose him as their closest friend. I don't know if this is good but I have accepted that we are not the closest anymore like we used to be and I don't have the right to be jealous of anything. I'm tired, I'm so done.

My friendships never last, something always happens. I always end up getting hurt. But because this happens so much to me i start to wonder if im the problem, maybe i have a victim complex? Do i get bored of people and purposely ruin things? I think its the way i react to things. If someone does something that upsets me a flip switches and i now see this person as the worst, i have a bad habit of saying things out of anger even things i dont mean, in my mind i hope i havent lost this person forever, but i do i end up losing them forever. Theres so much wrong with me. All my boyfriends have ended up blocking me and actually hating me. Ive been single for 8 months now and ive gotten worse at making friends and finding a partner. Ive had “talking stages” but its been difficult- for context ive talked to 3 different guys and i keep fucking it up, i wont reply anymore, ill be distant or rude,one guy i kept ghosting and he just apologizes cause he thinks he did something wrong and comes back to me but i feel like i was forcing myself to like him. And i have been honest with these guys, i tell them im battling a lot mentally and im sorry for being this way, but damn if you’re pretty enough a guy doesnt care if you treat him like shit… Anyways i did come to the realization that maybe im just not ready to date anyone and i should stop initiating things im not ready for to avoid hurting people. But now i think ive actually fallen in love with this girl, shes all i think about when i wake up and before i go to sleep, i keep reading the letter she wrote to me, listening to songs that make me think of her, she knows i love her but knows im not ready for anything right now. I cant help but wonder if my brain is playing tricks on me, clearly i cannot trust my own emotions. Am i actually in love or by next week will i find something to dislike about her, or will i convince myself im horrible and deserve nothing and i should just be left alone. But something is telling me this is different, i havent felt this way about a person in so long, it doesnt feel forced its more like i cant help but loving her, but im scared of hurting her. She knows everything about me and i expressed to her how i feel like i would ruin our friendship and i dont ever wanna lose her if we were to get romantically involved and then things get more complicated with me. But i know how patient she is and she would take care of me. She would be so good for me but i cant say i would be good for her. I would love her but im scared of what id do whenever i switch.

What he does is that he can ignore me for weeks or stop replying in the middle of a conversation, or leave me on read - which pisses me off. 

I never did the same to him. I never doit to anyone because it’s just bad tone. 

But when I don’t reply to him right away he gets mad at me. 

In the past he would make “jokes” about “training me” or “punishing” me for not giving him enough attention just because I was on the phone with someone but he wanted to call me right then and there. 

I just don’t f* get it. How ridiculous is this?

This time he texted me at 2AM and got pissed off that I didn’t reply - ignored me for a week hitting me up with “hey baby” today. I asked him what I did wrong and he said “what are you talking about” then he said he was upset that I didn’t reply to him that day and that it was a week ago and he is beyond that. I told him once again that I was drunk it was 2AM I didn’t see his message and I went to bed soon after. I told him that I never ignored him yet he is the one that could disappear for weeks yet he gets pissed off if I don’t reply to him right away. Guess what he did? He left me on read once again and now I’m just furious. 
 
Another guy that I used to be very close with started doing the same thing to me just cause he got pissed off i didn’t wish him a happy birthday. He never did that before. And it pisses me off. He’s been doing it for months now. 

Why is it that when you treat people well they start treating you like trash?

Do I gotta start acting the same way just to be respected? What am I doing wrong? Why does everyone treat me like this? Am I too nice of a person?

I do not know if I want an advice or if I’m just venting. I already tried cutting him off but then my mental just crashed during autumn I was alone and I had no one to talk to pretty much

141,Recently diagnosed,"So I was recently diagnosed with bpd and I’m having a real tough time dealing with it. 

I used to be a really social person who loved hanging out with others, and since I go to a boarding school there’s always a way to socialise with others, but the past two weeks after getting my diagnose I’ve been isolating myself from literally everyone except my fp. I’ve been out of my room a total of 5 hours these past 37 hours, and I feel like absolute shite at the same time as I feel empty and nothingness.

I also have trouble with my fp, as they have their own mental illness and struggle with dealing with my bpd. Sometimes when we argue they say they don’t deserve being treated *this* way and leave me for a couple of hours, which is the absolute worst thing because of my fear of abandonment. When they come back they act like nothing happened, but I still think they hate me and are gonna leave me completely this time. It is absolutely exhausting every time they walk out, and even though I understand that they walk out because I’m being too much and I’ve told them so, they are so absolute cold when they’re annoyed. I don’t understand how to deal with having an fp, let alone one without their own mental issues.

Any type of advice and support is welcomed, I don’t know anyone else with this disorder and everytime I try to describe it to someone w/out bpd they say they relate and it feels... off and invalidating",1574573446.0,False,5,0,gynecologay,None,e0ue42,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/e0ue42/recently_diagnosed/
142,FINALLY getting my diagnosis assessment and im scared of fucking it up,"Backstory: 24 years old, ive long known that there was something different about me, I grew up with a tough childhood, as did most if not all the people in this group. Finally went to the doctor sometime in my late teens and got diagnosed with depression and anxiety, the classic -.- im not saying that wasn't and still isn't true now but even back then, I knew that it was deeper than that. Since the age of roughly 15 I suspected BPD(now called EUPD), Attachment disorder or aspergers (now known as part of ASD)
That put me onto a natural interest in mental health and different disorders, the varying types of anxiety and personality disorders etc. This interest and build of knowledge also helped me immensly when it came to dealing with my mums own mental health crashes, my dads alcoholism and in turn, his eventual passing 6 years ago, my grandad 2 months later and my nan about a year after that. Life's just great, ain't it *insert eye roll here for full effect*

Cut back to the here and now, after several counsellors, different GP's, years worth of personal research and honestly just trying to find someone to believe me that it isn't just depression that I've been carrying around since I was like 4.

Well. Its finally happening!!!! I've got a video call apppintment happening in less than 3 weeks and I am so glad to finally be getting some answers and get on a track to treatments. I'm going to be tested for EUPD, CPTSD and she'll give me a brief screening for autism and if there is anything that comes from that I'll be redirected.

However, I am CRAP when it comes to actually explaining my symptoms and behaviours and thought patterns, things that have happened to me in the past, reactions I had to events or people when something happened etc... 
I'm going to preface the interview by telling her that I'm not very good with this sort of thing, especially as its going to be a video chat and not in person so I won't be able to gauge her reactions. Basically im terrified of messing up my chance to learn whats up with me by downplaying things or not wording things right.

Does anyone have any tips for diagnosis interviews, how to make sure you remember everything they will want to know about?? What kind of questions will they ask??

He tries his best with me because he understands I have mental health issues but I can’t deal with this anymore.

144,I think i’m spiraling.,"TW: TRAUMA, DEATH, S_!C!DE 

so me (18F) has bpd incorporated with bipolar 1 symptoms (my psychiatrist told me that and i’ve literally never heard of that), i’ve been keeping a relationship for maybe about 6-7 months. which is amazing for me but i’m seriously struggling mentally with myself. i’ve been having ptsd flashbacks of my deceased grandmother (i was very very close with her and saw her dead as a ‘vegetable’) so i have difficulty with shit because life’s no fun when you get a vivid visual of someone you love dead with their eyes open. i have been dropping weight recently because food looks like her corpse and i can’t eat it because it feels disgusting and wrong. i was friends with my bf (18M) for 2 years prior to dating and opened up to him and so he knows me fairly well. i try to turn to him for support maybe last minute when i’m already about to explode with pent up emotions but i don’t know if he just actually doesn’t really understand or if he’s choosing to not even try to understand. but i’ve been feeling unwanted. genuinely by everyone and it’s been a feeling for a while but people will sometimes say a remark that fuels it and really kinda hurts. i feel like what i do is wrong no matter how much i try to do right. i want to express this to my boyfriend but i don’t want him to think that i’m unsatisfied with him or something, i feel like i should say something because i’ve been having s_!c!dal ideations kinda? like whenever i do something wrong i immediately feel like taking my life is a good solution/option.. but i don’t want to die.. i just want it to stop so i can be normal and okay, at least just as a mask so that i’m able to deal with it myself behind closed doors. i know i should probably say something to my healthcare professionals but i don’t want the mention of hospitalization to pop up since it’s awful here and does more harm than good. i don’t have anyone that shares the same diagnoses with me that is actually rational and logical. so i have no one i can personally ask. i’m sorry if none of what i typed makes sense maybe but i seriously need someone to talk to that understands

But I keep running into the worst guys and I’m sat here like : what is so wrong with me that I attract these ppl? Realistically it’s bc I have no type and I pick up the first guy that shows me attention , regardless of his personality or looks and how compatible they are to mine. Recently I met a guy who’s a dream he’s literally a person I can actually see myself with beyond the lens of my obsessive mental illness. He does things for me that nobody ever has b4, his sense of humor is amazing he’s hot , I don’t rlly need to explain it . Point is he’s intent on not being exclusive (taxi cab theory anybody?) and I feel like a dickhead waiting around for him.  I’ve tried to distance myself bc I know I’m unhealthily obsessed with him but he just won’t let me, he’s a “talk it out” type of person . I had ONE rule , ONE FUCKING RULE and it’s so shockingly easy: Don’t sleep with my friends. And guess what? He tried to fuck my friend , THEN invited me to HER party ?? Said she was SOOOOO cool. Worst part? I may b a bit off but I have amazing pattern recognition so he chose the girl that I KNEW he would out of all my friends :)) All this in combo with the fact he always shows up with new hickeys or scratches that IK I didn’t do. I know I have BPD and I know I’m not well but that’s messed up right? Like fucking my friend to my face when u know it would upset me and telling me you’re talking to her regularly when you said I was the only one you talk to like this .  I should cut it off but it feels harsh to him bc it’s very new but he doesn’t understand that I’m not entirely doing it out of rage- he really doesn’t wanna be with me even if he thinks he does bc I’m not gonna be a good gf now that I don’t trust him . I think I should make a list of my real type like what I actually want, get off the dating apps and start learning how to be single and happy. How do I stop putting myself in these situations??

Sadly, on a regular basis the sub gets posts from disgruntled ex's, people looking for a disorder to blame instead of accepting that someone they know has acted like an arsehole towards them, and people who have no idea about what BPD is apart from a vague motion that we are all manipulative, nasty, crazy people. 

Questions such as ""Are people with BPD all evil?"", ""Does my ex/friend/child/partner have BPD?"" and  ""How can I get over being abused by someone with BPD?"" are not helpful and only add to the stigma around this condition.

BPD is a mental illness. It's treatable, but hard to deal with. It is not a comfort blanket for you to cast over any situation where anyone has ever hurt you.

149,I need tips,"So I (25f) have been with my partner for the past two years. I was upfront and honest about my mental illnesses (Obviously BPD being one) from the beginning and about the fact that I had been in therapy most of my life. I've done a lot of work to try to get to a point to where I could somewhat control my emotions, ourbursts, as well as maintaining a job, my hygiene, friendships, etc.


Things changed when a few things happened that really hurt the trust in our relationship. I'd not been in love with someone for a few years before him, and when I fell, obviously I fell hard. I was extremely secure before it happened. So when this trust was broken, I began a course of losing control daily.


I began doing the things. Constantly asking if he still loved me. If he was cheating on me. If he fancied other women. I started getting so deeply obsessed with trying to find connections that may or may not have been there. Some of it is still hazy to me. I started taking care of myself less and less. Snapping at him and immediately registering any shift in his mood as his declaration of calling it quits for us. Granted some things I ended up being right about, but they maybe they really were not THAT big of issues?


Anyways, obviously this has put a huge strain on our relationship. I want to give him credit where it's due and say he has tried here and there to reassure me, especially when things initially went down, and somewhat tried to rebuild that trust. But finally admitted how hard it is to want to rebuild that trust, and give that reassurance, when I myself am constantly overthinking and constantly needing reassurance multiple times a day, for days at a time. 


This post isn't to complain about him, or get an opinion on whether or not either of us are treating the other fairly. We have had multiple conversations with great communication confirming we both want to make things work in the end, so I am also not wanting people to decide whether we should stay together or not. I will not speak for him, but I will say I truly want to do at least everything I can as my part in making it work as I know how frustrating and exhausting it is to live with this inside my own mind, and can't imagine how frustrating and exhausting it must be for a partner.


Anyway, my main goal in writing this is to ask if anyone at all has any advice to help snap me out of when I am ""splitting"". How to get back to reasoning with myself before reacting. How to think critically, rather than overthink every word or action. I've been able to overcome my lack of personal hygiene and have gotten back into taking care of myself physically. But after digging myself so far back into this hole, I am struggling with how to navigate getting back out and reclaiming my functionality when it comes to living with my own brain.

152,what do I do when I hurt the person I care about the most,"Recently the other half and I have been having some issues and it all blew to a head the other night. he's been in a bad mental state and has been shutting me out, and I never handle that well. he said some scary things, saying he was going to kill himself and that nothing mattered. then last night he went for a walk and didn't text me I thought, and I just panicked. I was convinced that I was going to find him in a ditch after walking into traffic. after driving around looking for him, having a full on break down and splitting on him back and forth he finally told me where he was.

When I got to the place he wouldn't talk to me, or say anything, just occasionally texting his grandma who I assume was going to pick him up because he said he was spending the night ""out here"". I was angry and scared and I kept on asking him if this was the end and if I was going to see him tomorrow. He snapped and yelled at me and we started arguing, him accusing me of only caring about myself and that I wasn't the only thing that mattered.

Eventually he went to run away from him and I chased after him. He's faster and more athletic than me so I pushed him (we were in grass) to get him to fall down so he wouldn't get too far away from me. We argued again, he seemed like he was holding himself back from getting physical. He said I only cared about myself again and I was just so angry that I hit him in the back. I regretted it instantly, especially because that wasn't the first time someone he loved got violent with him.

He asked if I felt like a man. I said no. He asked if I felt better now. I said no. The anger was gone and I just felt shame and regret. He said I was just like everyone else, and he was right. I was supposed to be there for him and keep him safe and I fucking hit him. I've never done anything like that before, I didn't even think I was capable of that.

I told him I was sorry and that I loved him before I left. I'm so angry at myself. He probably just needed space and I know that he gets like this sometimes. But I couldn't leave him alone, I was too scared and emotional and this time I destroyed the best relationship I could hope for and hurt the person I cared about the most. I hate myself so much and I don't know what to do. I really really just wish I was dead and I low-key attempted last night but it wasn't even close to doing any real damage.

I don't know what I'll do without him and I don't even blame him for not wanting to be with me anymore, and part of me thinks that maybe I should leave him even if he wants to be with me.

Me (M19) and my Fp (M20) have been in a serious romantic relationship for quite a while, we both have bpd and he’s being evaluated for possible schizophrenia, we’ve both been open about our mental health and since the beginning, we’ve been open about our mutual fps on each other and due to it, our separation anxiety. Due to recent events which I won’t go into specifics to in attempts to keep this post as short as possible, my Fp was sent to the psychward for about a week or so, he had to give up his phone just about two hours ago and I’ve been at a total loss, I don’t know what to do with myself and I can’t stop crying, I don’t know how he is, how he’s doing, what he’s doing, nothing. We are long distance due to college starting in a few months so I cannot visit him, he wrote down my number before they drove him to facility so he wouldn’t forget it but it’s likely they won’t let him call me anytime soon. I’m in contact with his mom but our conversations have been limited and I am at a total loss.

I’ve tried distracting myself but there’s nothing i can do, i have no friends to rely on, I have no enjoyment for anything anymore, watching videos and playing games leave me with nothing, I feel a sense of emptiness so deep that it’s crippling, I don’t know what to do. He’s my support system, he’s my everything and without him I have nothing and I am nothing, I have awful thoughts and memories that I try to fend away but i cannot, nothing helps and I’m hurting. I am an artist, I have art I owe that I must work on but I can’t get myself to do anything, my hands are hurting, I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I can’t think or I think too much, I still can’t tell.

The worst part of it all is that I was forced to stop taking my medication suddenly after taking it consistently everyday since April. For some context, i started having an allergic reaction yesterday, mainly just hives, I still don’t know what from, today the hives were still here even after I spent the day yesterday taking allergy relief and lathering myself up In anti itch shit that really didn’t help much. I went to the doctor today once they started to swell, initially I suspected my medication because I didn’t eat or do anything out of the ordinary (i don’t go outside) but after being seen by the doctor and had blood taken, he ruled it out and I fainted, had a panic attack, had some stuff injected in me and all that good shit. I called my psychiatrist right afterwards for good measure and she was unable to speak with me since she was with another patient but her receptionist contacted me after speaking with her and I was informed to stop taking my medication all together until we could speak. 

My next appointment was meant to be June 3rd but I am considering calling in tomorrow and arranging a sooner appointment or something because I feel like I’m losing my goddamn mind(

I just feel like I have no direction right now and I miss him so badly im hurting physically and I don’t know when illl be able to finally hear from him again, I only have him, I have no one else, if he’s gone, im done for.

he was saying stuff like he had been miserable before he met me and i made him happy, that he wasn't going to khs because i was there. then what went wrong after that was when we were being intimate, he told me he loved me, when we had really not known each other for very long before that. that's when i kind of noped out and distanced myself. when we were talking about it he said that he feels like he used me and fucked with my feelings. that's when i cut it off because i was hurt and didn't want that to happen to me again

so then later he had a panic attack and said he needed an ambulance. i was confused and he told me that i made him feel better and now i was leaving he felt so much worse again. I don't judge him for anything and i know he can't control it.
later after this he got dissociative amnesia and completely forgot everything that happened. i was completely wiped from his memory as a defense mechanism.

this is when i really fucked up, because i kept talking to him. at first i only said the good things that happened; he said that was okay and we agreed to be friends.
after this i thought that he was stable again so i told him more about what happened, and that i felt hurt, violated and stupid. he went back into crisis.
I did what I could; I called another ambulance, checked in at his, talked him through it and offered to do anything I could to help.
though he ended up telling me that this was my fault. I’d been bedridden and very consumed by guilt after this. it's really triggered my own mental health issues

One of my personal values is that I don’t think that is is anyone’s fault, unless that person was abusive. And I’m so, so worried that what I did was fucked up, and potentially slightly emotionally abusive, it reminds me of when I was abused emotionally by my ex fp of 3 years. He told me he was vulnerable and didn’t want to know what went wrong. I selfishly told him anyway…

This was about a week and a half ago. We actually only knew each other for a few days. But I know for sure that this person is my new FP.

The call went fine and the person didn’t do anything wrong but I couldn’t stop thinking about how terrible I am, how I talk to much, how embarrassing I am, how no one can stand me, my own husband ect and I’m so tired of making a fool out of myself. I’m tired of existing and failing. After dinner I asked my husband to take my son with him and get us some ice cream, I wanted to be alone.. you get the point. I know it sounds pathetic but I thought that was my only chance and if I didn’t do it then I would keep suffering and things have not ever got better, I don’t want to live in pain anymore.

TW: idk if I’m allowed to talk about the details this is my first post on here. But here it goes- I grabbed my husbands hand *** and loaded it. Finished up my note that’s been sitting in my phone for a while and put it up to my head. I then got scared and couldn’t do it. Thinking of SI is one thing (sounds easy enough, sounds like a release) but in the actual moment I was actually scared of the pain. Finally I heard my husband pull back up the house so I quickly put everything back up. I went out like everything was normal and he went to where the stuff was and said “WHY WERE YOU MESSING WITH MY STUFF” I said I wasn’t and he called me a child and said “wow now I can’t even keep these in the house” he unloaded them all. I he kept verbally harassing me. I put my son to bed and slept in our guest room and he hasn’t talked to me since. 

Now I feel so embarrassed and alone. He makes me feel pathetic. I know I am. I’m barely hanging on and no one seems to care. I have told my mother and close people how bad it is and they said “sorry maybe you should get on meds “ I’ve been on soo many different types of meds my whole life and it was a nightmare, felt like I was living in a shell. 

Anyways, I guess I needed to let it out. Maybe talk to someone who is going through the same.",1700236522.0,False,4,3,ZealousidealLet4898,None,17xi547,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/17xi547/last_night_i_almost_ended_things_tw_si_and_su/
157,Finally found the perfect partner but....,"So I'm in the what I can already tell is going to be the best relationship I've ever been in. We are both 27 years old, (gay) and we both have never connected with anyone else like this. He know about my bpd, is INCREDIBLY supportive, and we know we don't need ver want to leave each other. We have been doing the long distance thing, only separated by a 2ish hour drive from each other, and see each other every weekend because of our schedules. The distance has been teaching me patience, and has only made the times when we see each other more valuable to the both of us. For the first time in years, maybe even my life, I have found someone who pushes me to be my best self, and wants what's best for me. Let me reiterate: we have no interest in looking for anyone else, we both have found all of the puzzle pieces that we were both missing in our lives. And for me, I finally feel emotionally and mentally mature enough in my journey with BPD to feel this is what we want. 

I've been doing really good so far, no sabotage, no mood swings, and no arguments. Of course I expect these issues in time, as no relationship is perfect without fighting and misunderstanding. That's not exactly the problem. My anxiety is over the roof, because I started making changes in my life that were for the better (and those started before and after I met him) but they are good changws. I quit smoking nicotine, pot, been going to the gym, eating healthy, and fixing my finances. Really good changes have been made. And a lot of it is because we dream of a future together. I've never been with someone who has been this intensely supportive, it was the one thing I was missing in all previous relationships.

With that being said, I feel some of the old symptoms I felt like I've overcome creep again. I'm very clingy, and the distance can make that hard. Sometimes I don't hear back from him for a while (he works graves, and goes to school). I know he's not cheating, and to be honest that's not what stresses me, it's just that I don't hear from him like we first did in the relationship. The honeymoon phase is probably ending, so things aren't probably as climactic like they were in the beginning. I understand all this, yet I feel overwhelmed that I'm going ruin things because of my extreme anxiety, and over analyzation of the small things. I know he's not going anywhere, and I'm not going anywhere.

I guess what I'm asking for is some advice. Who else has hard times not always hearing back from their partner? Does anyone else have issues when you don't hear things back in the times you usually do? What do you guys do to cope or calm yourselves down from irrational thinking? It's seriously becoming the death of me, even when I know things are just fine and peachy, I can t help but overthink and miss him all the time.

Also, is this something that I can safely try to explain to him? He wants me to always feel comfortable talking to him about anything, and I feel I'd find some comfort on letting him know that I need lots of reassurance, but obviously I don't want to push him to hard or scare him. I really feel like I've found my forever partner, and I just want to take this the smart and safe way to a successful relationship.",1706935473.0,False,6,2,BodybuilderLoose9437,None,1ahnvwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ahnvwl/finally_found_the_perfect_partner_but/
158,I am on the verge of giving up on life and i need help.,"I (24 female) have been diagnosed with bpd 2 years ago. I’ve gone through lots of therapy and lots of medications but it feels like no matter how hard i try i always go back to my older self the minute i am triggered. I feel stressed and tired of life and i feel so alone. I work a full time job while attending university (studying engineering) at the same time and its been so hard on me. I am all alone in life which means i had to work and figure things on my own since i was 16 years old and i am so exhausted. I am trying to do better and be a better person, friend and partner but its like i am the most despicable person to them so i don’t blame anyone for abandoning me but it’s so hard one me cuz i am trying and i don’t want to be that person but i cant. 

It feels like I’ve hit rock bottom and my life is a mess. I am on academic probation due to my declining gpa and grades even though i am trying my best i am attending every class doing everything on time studying well before every exam but i seem to be doing something wrong cuz my grades don’t reflect that. My job isn’t going that well it’s so stressful and triggering and i am overworking myself cuz I can’t lose it or i will be homeless with my university tuition, rent, bills etc…., My house is a total mess its disgusting  i am so embarrassed to show it to anyone its the worse it has ever got though i live in a tiny space. 

My relationship with my partner isn’t going that well and i am mainly the reason why. He supported me more than anyone in my life and been there for me through everything but when it comes to mental illnesses he doesn’t really understand what i am going through and keeps trying to encourage me in the wrong way with things that work for normal people or for him not for someone who is suffering from crippling anxiety and depression as well as bpd. Though he is trying to change his views.

And i need help cuz i can’t do this anymore and i want to give up i see no hope for future the harder i try the worse it gets and though i love my partner more than life and is the i only person in my life, he is better off without me i hurt him so much that I can’t even forgive myself anymore though he worked through it all with me. I cant do this life anymore i have nothing to look forward to and honestly don’t want anything. 

Also, I struggled with self harm, alcoholism, and drug abuse but i worked through all that but these days the only thing on my mind is to just get black out drunk though I’ve been sober for a year. And its so hard to battle my urges. 

If you have any advices or experiences please share with me cuz it feels like i get a virtual hug when i talk to people who understand things and going through the same things i am going through.",1699861215.0,False,4,1,Informal-Loan3063,None,17u5m67,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/17u5m67/i_am_on_the_verge_of_giving_up_on_life_and_i_need/
159,Struggling with being lied to,"(TW) . 


When my husband and I met. I expressed that due to my being a recovering addict. That a big part of my step by step process to recovery is to not be with anyone who uses. It’s just a major trigger for me (not just because of my sobriety but because of a very abusive relationship I was in). So dating someone who is recovering as well is just something I mentally am not ready for. My now husband was involved in a lifestyle that had led me to believe he may be using drugs. I asked him about it to which he swore up and down he’d never have done. That from his childhood. He just grew to an understanding drugs are life destroying  and he’d never touch them. (His parents were addicts) I  told him good because I can’t enter a relationship with you if you’re newly sober, using etc. I’m not stable enough on my own sobriety journey to do so. (I explained more in depth but it’s a very touchy and trigger subject for me to talk about) Well. Fast forward. We’re now newly weds and he comes to me with a confession. That he lied to me and was in fact only 2 weeks sober when we met. He told me he didn’t tell me because he didn’t want to lose me. But at the time of the conversation we had only just met, we hadn’t even began dating yet. There have been multiple situations in our relationship where I felt like he may be doing drugs. But because he said he’s never touched them. I ignored my gut feelings and moved past them. This feels catastrophic to me. Like it’s the end of the relationship. There are other factors as well. But being lied to is always been my biggest problem when it comes to people. Once I’ve been lied to. I cut ties. But it isn’t that simple as we’ve just gotten married.. I feel very trapped and hurt. It feels like he’s intentionally waited until we got married to drop this on me. Especially bc he’s become so open about it all as if he’s been that way the whole relationship. I’m constantly having to tell him I’m not comfortable with the conversation as it is very triggering. But he just doesn’t seem to get it. Ultimately I feel like my choice was taken from me. If I had known I would’ve gladly remained in his life as his friend. But I wouldn’t have dated him. Let alone married him.  Which makes me feel like a horrible person for saying. But I expressed that to him when we met and he chose to withhold the fact he’s recovering from me as a response. He said he didn’t know how to tell me after I said I wouldn’t date him and that he didn’t want to lose me either and just be friends. I feel like I don’t know him anymore.

160,"I(25F) told my mum I want to talk tomorrow but I have no idea what I even want to say - Confront my emotional neglect or just go NC?? T.w. neglect, self harm, OD","Thanks in advance to anyone that reads and responds x 

Tl;dr - HAE confronted their parent/s about the damage they've caused, how did you do it and how did it go?? 

I know that this is probably going to be a fruitless exercise and I will more than likely walk away feeling x10 worse than I did going into it but something within me wants to try before I go back home to my flat the day after. 

Bit of backstory: I've been staying with my mum and stepdad since Dec. 19th and up until boxing day, things had been going pretty well. Since boxing day I've been totally ignored and all the feelings of emotional abuse and neglect that I've worked/still working so hard to overcome from childhood came rushing back with a vengeance. Ive spent several nights in tears, at least 2 evenings/nights wanting to self harm again, one night spent lightly self harming and ive reached the limit to what I am willing to put up with from her. 

Now I've tried several times to talk to my mum about the way I feel about how she acts and treats me, sometimes she seems to change for a few weeks before something inevitably angers her and she goes right back to her old narcissistic, emotionally immature ways. 

My older sister went non contact with her and moved away several years ago and I have been considering going non contact for the last couple years but something in me is holding onto hope that one day I will get through to her. 

I know many of you will say that it is pointless, that people like this dont change but I wouldn't forgive myself if I just went NC without trying one last time. The biggest problem I'm having though is that I have no frickin idea how on earth to begin this conversation. I know the gist of what I want to say to her but im scared she'll do the usual and just get defensive and angry for me essentially pointing out all the things she's done wrong as a parent. The inner child in me is screaming to be validated and to hear her say that she is sorry and if im honest, I am screaming at myself the same things. I understand that I need to be able to heal myself and shouldn't rely on her to do this in order for me to move on but no matter how hard I try (and I am really fucking trying) I cant seem to let the idea go. I'm pretty sure that this is because there are times when things between us are good and we can laugh together and talk like normal people without me feeling like im on edge just being in the same room as her. However, most of the time I feel like im either stuck in ""Freeze mode"" (the 4 F's) any time she talks to me, or one of the others (I can go into ""Fight mode"" very quickly because of my BPD which tend to just make any situation worse) 

Now, middle of last year I ended up in hospital a couple nights because of an OD and after that I feel like my mum started to take my mental health slightly more seriously because I told her that she was a lot to blame for how I had been feeling. I also recieved two diagnosis' last year of C-PTSD and BPD. This isn't something I feel my mum takes very seriously and this is one thing I know I want to talk to her about. 

Things my mum likes to do during these convos in the past include but aren't limited to:
- say I should move on and let things go
- gets angry/sarcastic/defensive
- starts playing the victim

161,"I'm in a deep hole, and it's not my fault.","My mom didn't pay any of the rent in a flat the city arranged for us. Since she's still raising 2 kids and work only 3/4 times, the court deemed her unable to pay up, so now I will have to pick up the bill.

But I don't want to, I Fucking don't want to and don't have to.

She broke me mentally and socially.
 I've been babysitting her kids since I turned 7, every day, I wasn't allowed to go out on my own more than twice per month.

She never cared for me, never went to parents-teachers meetings, never thought of helping me with homework.

Whenever I went to her and asked for help because I was getting bullied she brushed it off with ""then change yourself if you don't fit in"" 

She never did anything when my deadbeat father was beating me, with belts, spoons, cables, broom handles, kicks, punches. Not a word I heard. I don't actually remember if she hugged me.

I couldn't ask her to appoint a doctor for me. Whenever I was sick she'd wait until I get better or I couldn't get out of the bed. 

She never cared for my dental health, never bought me a toothbrush, toothpaste or a floss.

When I had a rotten tooth she waited for 3 weeks to appoint me with a dentist, and only after the pain was so intense I had severe delirium and tried to kill myself, but it was too late and I had to undergo an emergency tooth extraction, and even then she was hesitant to pay $20 for an anesthesia shot. 

She'd never buy me new clothes, only after my old ones were to small she would go to a thrift store and buy me some 2nd hand old clothes. 

When I said in school that I don't think I'm good up the dome (a saying in my country), they appointed me to a psychiatrist, she was hesitant, missed the first term, after I got another term she went with me once. After the meeting doctor said that I show symptoms of ADHD, depression and possible BPD. After that she told me to ""act normal and shut up about our problems in school"" because she won't be going to the shrink with me. 

I never asked for things like a PC, smartphone, a bike or a fucking allowance.

I could go on and on about how she fucked me up, but when I turned a legal age I went to work, every day after the school I was working 5 to 12 at local McDonald's to bring some money and support the family. And I did support her, gave her enough to cover the rent, paid the electricity bills, bought her new furniture, new fridge, new shower cabin, whenever one of my siblings needed something I was the first to whip out my wallet. 

And now I was sentenced to pay a Fucking debt of almost $10000 because this Fucking bitch never cared for anything but booze and drugs! 

I don't have that kind of money, I don't know where to find it, I don't know what to do. I thought I was finally free of her when I moved out, but no. She had to do me dirty one last time. 

I Fucking hate her. 

It is a vent but I hope someone might help me and tell me what to do. 

This whole thing has turned me into an aggressive asshole, I've pushed everyone away and whenever someone says something on the street to me I just yell ""fuck off"" or go straight to a brawl.

162,trying to be a happy adult,"As a quick question, what do you guys do to cope with bpd or heal from traumas? Especially without a therapist or medication 

I actually had therapy and meds since I was 13/14 years old, till I was 20 last year I stopped using my parents insurance because I completely distanced myself from my family and honestly everyone all my friends from the past because they all just were shit to me. 

After I left rehab when I was 17, I still had my bpd symptoms but I experienced a weird like 2 years just not feeling real. I don't remember much of that but I just really dissociated all the time. 

I started having friends again, smoking more heavily, did risky things more than ever. I even tried almost not even wanting to think about the past, I wanted to reconnect with my family a bit. But pretty much every single of those people ended up really hurting me. There's so much that was happening. My life honestly felt like hell to me, and it hurt my soul that growing up I've always thought about how the hurt seems to only get worse and worse. And here I am wanting to just be okay, start living independently. But my family doesn't give a fuck to admit their mistakes, these friends are all fake, people think I'm weird. I still get anxiety at work hoping customers don't notice or say anything about my arms covered in scars. 

But I'm so tired of suffering from my past wounds I want to just get rid of but why does the pain stay? I know I'll have to struggle with my mental illness, and just try to maintain it. I barely managed to get an insurance but so far it hasn't helped, I hate when these things list places that don't accept them!

it simply made my whole mood go dark and twisted. and this brings me memories of my time together with this ex friend, and how i often felt this exact same way many times. i guess it’s jealousy that comes from fear of abandonment. and now i seem to wonder my thoughts into “see, this is why you can’t have friends, just ditch them nicely and be alone again, it’s better for everyone”. i do therapy and i take my meds daily, and im not in love with the guy, this happens with anyone i try to get close and have a friendship, also i have a bf. its like i cant handle a person im close to having other people that they are close to. i feel at a loss.",1662500879.0,False,7,1,arecatsminerals,None,x7mvqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/x7mvqe/just_venting_and_trying_to_understand/

UK ONLY PLS need help getting diagnosed for my BPD 

background:
I’m turning to help from you guys because I have nowhere else to get advice from on this . So I’ve struggled with MH since 2013 (age 13) - thought to have severe mood/emotional problems and anxiety , start visiting the GP being turned away constantly/promised referrals which fell through/put on years of waiting lists 
After a self harming incident in 2015 age 15) in which my mother finds out about, she books me an appointment with priv sector psychologist who mentions the possibility of bpd but still classified me as having depression.
See a few more doctors 2016-18 still trying to get referrals for an assessment at least and the day before I go to uni (2018) I finally had my assessment appointment booked in for then!!!
AND THEY CANCELLED IT ON THE DAY
(due to staffing reasons?!!!!!!!)
heartbroken I go to uni terrified 
Due to situational factors I don’t attempt to access mh resources at uni till October (2019).After  an a&e  visit after an attempt, a referral made to an ADULT assessment team was made by my GP. 
after a phone call a few days later (so exciting at this point) they say they’ll contact me for an appointment in 2-3 weeks however it is now March (6 months later basically) and nothing .... 
I spoke to a guidance counsellor at my uni and she said I need to hassle my gp which just isn’t gunna do anything at this point 

I’d just really appreciate if someone in the UK could please please please tell me how on Earth I’m able to get a proper diagnosis for my bpd?  I understand under 18 services are limited and more difficult - in an adult now and I really need to be diagnosed like I just NEED to know I need it confirmed by a doctor not by others telling me and my own research.

What do I do now , obvs quarantine is preventing all this but I need a plan for when this is over :( 

Where do I go ? What do I say ? 
I feel SO lost and deserted - it’s been 6 years I’ve been struggling with bpd symptoms, 2 attempts , 6 occasions of self harm and yet no one will help me

168,how do i stop these constant intrusive thought cycles ?,"I am 23 years old and have been diagnosed with BPD from a very young age, which i always found odd because such diagnoses are not usually given out that early. Besides the point after lots of therapy and lots of different medication I decided medication was not for me and using my skills/ maturing and growing would supplement. I absolutely hate the way medication makes me feel and I was very open to trying tons of different options from tons of different psychiatrists. Throughout all this time it’s just been years and years of absolute insanity I went through serious verbal emotional and sometimes physical abuse from my father when I was little developed a self harm and literal heroin addiction which after years and years I was able to knock. I was in a horrid relationship with a 30 year old grown man with BPD when i was 19 that was horrid but i was petrified to lose my cats ( which he ended up stealing anyways) But I finally mustard up the courage to leave. After that I really started diving into my healing, setting boundaries staying active and with purpose doing hobbies instead of going out to the bars so much. It was all starting to clear up for me and I was no longer a sad shell of a person with constant insane thoughts controlling my brain and perception. I have now began a new relationship with another undiagnosed man w BPD ( his family is holistic but his mother and sister have told me it runs in family and he definitely has it) way closer to my age range actually enjoys the things I enjoy I love him so much and it’s truly been so fun and showed me what I deserve in a partnership! BUT he has never seen any medication or therapy and has severe episodes that do always include extreme verbal abuse and sometimes extreme physical abuse. Because of these episodes I have started having mine again, which makes me uneasy as it has been a long longggg time since i’ve had a violent raging self harming BPD episode and it scares me and makes me feel gross about my self. So with all that context this morning we had a very big discussion about how his episodes are causing me to digress and im feeling more and more mentally i’ll every day. He has agreed to make changes and be a more active communicator. But i just have this sinking feeling that no matter how it goes all the hurt has piled up too much and my brain won’t let me forget all the lies and hurtful words and abuse. It also makes me wonder if people with BPD are just destined to be alone my mom always frowns upon me dating even though ive only had 2 boyfriends my whole life. I’m just scared that the thoughts in my head are going to consume me all my life until  i can’t live with it and i don’t know how to make them stop I feel very hopeless but I also know how to cope and start getting back to a place of productive healing i’m just weary of having to constantly talk myself of the ledge for my whole life.

169,Dating someone with BPD,"Hi guys I’m after some advice and guidance. 
I (F44) have recently started dating a guy (45) who has BPD. We have known each other for years. He was very open about his BPD from the start and explained how sometimes he would push people away, how he would become distant and over think things and other traits that he wanted me to be aware of. We get on really well and we seem to be on the same page regarding our feelings for each other and what we want.

170,Disclaimer: Long Post <3,"⚠️PSA:⚠️
There’s no such thing as being behind in life or being behind in society…the only things along those lines that are real are social constructs, societal bias and comformity, generational trauma, closed-mindedness, desperation for validation from other people, the illusion of superiority in the form of unnecessary, unwanted, and unasked for judgement, the fear the government specifically designs to control the people to get more money and power, peer pressure, and unhealthy perfectionism. Don’t be a sheep, allow yourself to be a unique, beautifully imperfect human…life has no set schedule or manual, so stop comparing yourself to others. Don’t be afraid to be different or go against the societal/social norm. Learn to be okay with being controversial, and unlearn society’s unrealistic standards. You’re uniquely you. It’s not your job to keep everyone else happy. However it is your job to keep your peace and to do what’s best for your life, your plans, and your mental health…even if it upsets people. You’re worth it. Stop caring about what other people think of you and other people’s opinions…they’re just that, opinions. It’s time to stop fearing other people, they’re only human, just like you, with their own flaws and challenges and personal hells to go through. If something doesn’t affect you, just shut up about it and don’t butt into other people’s business. It’s not your life, it’s theirs, and you’re not them. And to incorrectly assume you know exactly what someone might be going through or what it’ll take to cut them into one of society’s boring, sheep, conformist cookies, is just so wrong and sad and pathetic on so many levels. Again, you’re not them, you’re not in their mind, you’re not in their situation, so shut up about things you know nothing about, doesn’t matter if they’re friends or family. It’ll just make things worse if you judge and assume. And things you say literally have the ability to stick with people and rewire their brains and change their brain chemistry, so don’t be the reason people start thinking that they’re not enough or even the reason they start considering unaliving themself. Be the opposite. Perfection doesn’t and will never exist, no matter what society says. Fuck society and their unrealistic, engineered standards. Don’t add to society’s toxicity, half of them don’t deserve the time of day. Your imperfections are beautiful. Additonally, always try to spread love, positivity, understanding, unconditional support, and empathy wherever and whenever you can, you never know what someone else might be going through and you could even be the person to restore their faith in humanity 💖

I’m proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself too, even for the baby steps. Some progress is better than no progress at all, ignore the haters and don’t let them put you back to square one…and don’t let them make you even think that you’re back at square one when they’re not you and don’t have your mind or your experiences, it’s not their life, and they have no right to judge your progress, especially when I know half of your progress most people are too blind to see…I see your progress, and you’re doing absolutely amazing 😊

171,Advice on how to manage symptoms without professional help?,"This post might be a bit long so sorry in advance. tldr; I have no access to MH services and need advice on managing my symptoms. 

For a bit of background, I've had issues with anger and lashing out as long as I can remember. My other symptoms started to display between the ages of 13 and 16 and have progressively got worse as I've gotten older. I live in the UK and was with CAMHS while in college, my CAMHS worker said that she was pretty much certain I have BPD, but because I was 17 she couldn't officially diagnose me due to guidelines (something about puberty and hormones causing the symptoms, idk). My sessions were first thing on a Friday morning but as I progressed in college I needed to spend all my time on campus and couldn't go to my appointments anymore, and was discharged.

Since then I've not been to any sort of therapy, I went back to my GP at 18 and they put me on anti depressants which did absolutely nothing but made me feel worse and I stopped. I'm now nearing 21 and have been referred to my local mental health services maybe 4 or 5 times since, but nothing has ever come of it, they've just told me to self refer to drug groups/anger management groups despite the fact that I've said multiple times that my drug and anger issues are due to a larger problem, not the sole problem theirselves. I'll admit that I'd sort of given up with it due to being fucked around so many times, but recently my boyfriend got super worried after a breakdown which resulted in me not leaving my room for 6 days, bearly eating, crying near constantly and lashing out when he came to check on me because I took him not spending all 6 days with me as him not caring about me. After I'd regained my senses, I agreed to give getting help another go, and sent in an online form to the local services describing all my symptoms, explained that I've been told by CAMHS I've probably got BPD but couldn't be diagnosed at the time, and wanted help for that. 

Well this was at the beginning of March, and obviously with everything going on now, I doubt I'm going to get any help until this has all blown over.
I can feel myself slipping back into old habits, getting stupidly impulsive, saying nasty things without thinking, my moods won't stay consistent for more than an hour at a time and I'm getting increasingly paranoid that my boyfriend, housemates, family, basically everyone hates me and wants me dead. I really don't know how to handle this anymore, part of me knows I'm being ridiculous but it feels like the sane part of me is locked in a room watching the mental part of me take control and ruin every aspect of my life.

For those of you better adjusted than I am, how do you cope with these things, and generally for anyone, how do you manage your symptoms without access to proper psychological help? I feel like a massive burden to my boyfriend and can't go on much longer than this.",1585871847.0,False,4,3,snmrespnnjllyfsh,None,ftxj8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/ftxj8c/advice_on_how_to_manage_symptoms_without/

173,I can’t believe I’m doing this,"TRIGGER WARNING: suicide, self harm and all that bad mental health stuff. (Sorry if I did that wrong). 

Hi redditors. I’ve never posted before. Thanks for reading and responding if you choose to do so. I’m sorry if the following triggers you or if you are struggling with the same brand of futile terrible I am. 

I’m at a point in my life where I’ve struggled so much and for so long that I’m just exhausted. I’m not angry or bitter or sad anymore; I just want it to be over. I’m tired of being confused all the time, completely disconnected from this thing called ‘life’ everyone seems to be switched into. I’m tired of being panicky and depressed and anxious all at the same time, almost all the time. Im tired of being at the mercy of my insane mood swings where I'm experiencing overlapping interchanges of all these conflicting emotions all day long. I'm tired of crying so often that it feels like my brain is going to explode in my own head and my eyes will just cease to function properly. I’m tired of being dismissed when I say I’m unwell (psychiatrist included) because ‘I’m doing so well’ - I don’t even know what this means or how you could conclude that from someone whose chronically unemployed, can’t finish uni or even leave the house or make eye contact with people without panicking. I feel like an absolute rotting turd most of the time despite what I’m putting out there (which feels to me like a shit show but to other people for some reasons seems completely normal).

People seem to consistently make this crazy assumption that I’m ‘intelligent and capable’ for some reason and therefore I don’t need help. They couldn’t be more wrong. I can’t accomplish basic tasks because I’m emotionally all over the place all the time and trying to do basic human things like pick what to wear in the morning sends me into shame spirals, suicidal thoughts and urges to self harm. I have no control over my emotions or impulses, I’m constantly floating away from my body and nothing feels real. I’m incapable of accepting any kind of affection or goodwill from others without completely self destructing and I don’t want to burden others so my relationships are nonexistent. 

I’ve dealt with thoughts, feelings, urges and attempts of suicide my entire life. Its pretty much always been a terrifying backup in the back of my mind ever since I can remember as a safety plan to escape the torture of life where I can always feel exactly how close I am to death. Some days feel a magnetism to it but a strong resolve to resist. Other days, I’m basically hanging on by a thread and not telling anyone so they don’t come and take me from my home against my will again. 

I just want the freedom to be able to make this decision on my own. I did not give consent to be born, and I don’t think it’s ethical to keep someone alive against their will when they are suffering chronically and there isn’t a solution. 

I just feel like there’s no way out. I don’t respond to medications and suffer from such severe side effects that my psychiatrist refuses to prescribe any more drugs. My old psychiatrist had me on 5 different meds and I was equally bad, maybe worse, but in a completely different way. Those who have had adverse reactions to medications will understand this. Being mentally ill or being on psychiatric medication is like choosing if you want death by drowning or self-immolation.

I do DBT group therapy, see a psychologist and psychiatrist but I still feel like absolute shit. Everyone seems to be going through the motions, ticking all the boxes, but I just feel like nothing has really shifted. No amount of bandaids is going to help me when I’m walking around absolutely raw with no fucking skin on my body. It’s excruciating to just be alive but because it’s not visible, and it’s a slow death, nobody cares and the state ‘has a responsibility’ to keep you alive. In my experience, everyone is all sad when someone kills them selves, but also calls them selfish because they’ve left so much pain in their wake. Being passed around a mental health care system that can’t really help you, is insanely expensive and practically useless makes me miss the days when I didn’t seek help, suffered in silence but could at least hold on to the hope that there was a possibility of getting better if I had the right help. Now I know that’s not even an option. 

I’m just doomed to relive this cycle of extreme pain, possible suicide, absurdity, exhaustion, sheer terror, panic attacks, extreme mood swings, paranoia, catatonia, confusion, dissociation, spontaneous stuttering, paralysis and fatigue, where I can’t seem to express myself clearly no matter how hard I try or connect with other people. 

I am incapable of feeling positive emotions. No matter how hard I try, I just can’t stop the anxiety, panic, negativity, paranoia and depression from seeping in. I fear my emotions, I fear my thoughts and the things in life I can’t control that are going to hurt me so I just live in a constant state of sheer paralysis, frozen in fear and bracing myself for impact.

The only thing that’s keeping me alive is the thought that my sister will have to deal with the trauma of my suicide. But it also seems like it should be unethical to keep a person in this much chronic pain alive. I can feel my body deteriorating, my mind is basically scrambled eggs at this point, and I feel like I’m at the mercy of an emotionally handicapped body that I have zero control over. I keep harming myself and those around me. I just want to die with a little bit of dignity but there doesn’t seem to be a way out.

Life seems to be one trauma after the next, and continued reluctant attempts to help myself that only end up in things getting worse. I was not made for this world. I wasn’t supposed to be here. Please let me go. I don’t want to hurt anyone but I’m so tired now.

174,"I am ADHD, he is BPD (EUPD)","Long time lurker, first time poster.

So, ADHD is predominately diagnosed as a male condition but I am an adult, 32 year old woman, diagnosed with full spectrum ADHD! Whoop whoop! Energy for days! Bipolar Disorder (BPD/EUPD) is mainly diagnosed in women. However, my ex partner, 33 year old guy, has been diagnosed as EUPD. He feels everything! No matter how much I google I can’t seem to find any other couples that have had this dynamic. So, dear redditors, I call upon you to help me figure out whether or not this could be a healthy partnership should we both learn to appreciate the other?

We broke up in September 2019 due to financial problems and discovering he had addictions. So, that’s where the money went?!?! His behaviour became aggressive and me not fully grasping socially awkward situations probably aggravated him. No excuse for his behaviour, but equally I am extremely difficult to live with. Before September we were what I call the perfect couple. Holidaying with the kids, supportive of each other’s careers and he was extremely caring when it came to my ADHD (he was not diagnosed till after the relationship ended). Plus our sex life was out of this world!!! Like seriously, it was like a drug itself, being as it appears both impulsive in nature. 

So, we broke it off after some pretty serious arguments. Great, we can all move on with our lives!?!! Nope!!! Thing is, all that time before was PERFECT! Like I have never experienced! But being the stubborn cow I am I wasn’t about to tell him that. Then he messaged on Christmas and has been messaging a lot since then. Updates on his diagnosis, his medication and how he wants to date again. 

The question is, can an ADHDian and a BPDian have a healthy, happy relationship? And how is there such an attraction between two people with these traits?

176,"BPD, CPTSD, Bipolar 2","Sorry for this long rant, trying to make sense of my broken life and needed to share with others who might be more understanding about what I’m going through, with my mental illness.

How do you find yourself again after being so lost? Grasping for hope, I want to change my life. Tired of living this low life. My boyfriend and I broke up 9 months ago, he was my FP. I did a lot to damage our relationship and engaged in a lot of self sabotaging. He’s at fault too, for things in the relationship. We broke up I slept with someone and got pregnant. Sadly I’ve been dealing with a lot of guilt and shame about the situation. I want so badly to reconnect and reconcile our broken relationship. I’ve been in an incredibly lonely and depressed state. I miss the good parts of our relationship and certainly do not want to go back to the dysfunctional state our relationship ended up being. Throughout the relationship I self medicated and numbed my feelings with weed and alcohol, I let it cloud everything. With being pregnant I’ve become sober, and I’m trying to deal and correct my behaviors. I’ve been seeing the psychiatrist to get a proper diagnosis and a treatment plan, seeking out therapy. I heavily rely on others to make me feel whole, or I just isolate until it’s absolutely crippling. I’m 7 months pregnant now and I’m confused by everything, baby daddy isn’t involved and is toxic and probably just as unstable as I am….but I’m doing all things to prepare for the twins. I don’t know if I’m grasping for straws with my ex to fill the void I’m feeling. I’ve done a lot of splitting towards him and caused a lot of unnecessary turmoi. I’m bipolar 2, suffer from CPTSD and BPD. I also am already a single mother to a 12 year old who is extremely fond of my ex. His father isn’t involved in his life and the closest thing he has had to a fatherly figure is my ex. We both miss him greatly. What is your honest take/opinion on my situation, is there hope for us? Or should I just pick up the broken pieces, let go and move forward? My ex has been incredibly patient with me and my Illness but I stayed stuck in denial that I needed help. But being clear headed I see more clearly. Since finding out I was pregnant my ex has expressed that he wants to be there and father my twins, but I’m afraid I’m too late. He moved across the state to be with another woman but at the same time I know I’d he felt it was worth it he would drop everything to be with me….. we both have mad love for each other but so afraid that things can’t and won’t get better, but also hope that things can change and growth will come, despite our setbacks.",1688445912.0,False,1,0,Old-Meet-1322,None,14q52w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/14q52w4/bpd_cptsd_bipolar_2/

I cannot tell them anything or show any emotion without them undermining mine or making fun of me. Its probably because they are hard people who probably never had their feelings/thoughts validated but it still stings every time. Many people talk about how abusive their ethnic parents are online and i hate how its just considered normal. Like why cant they solve their own issues before they become parents. Am I wrong for wanting to be away from them? My dad is the most rediculous person i know. About 3 years ago he got arrested for domestic abuse and had to leave my house. Due to this I only see him about 1 time every couple of weeks. He had the nerve to ask my siblings why i never reach out to him. I was shocked that he would even ask that considering he is the grown adult and i was a busy high school student at the time. To him, providing financially is all that matters and even if he could he barely kept his promises to help me learn to drive/buy me a car. I never press him to buy anything for me.

182,Success and Struggles,"I really just needed to talk about things with others that may be able to relate.

Some BG:

So, I've had mental health issues as long as I can really remember. I was in and out of psych hospitals and treatment from my mid-teens until present (now almost 36). I am diagnosed with both MDD and BPD, and while things have improved a lot since I was younger, things are still a struggle a lot of the time. I'm learning that I'll never really react to the world as someone who's more 'neurotypical', and that's okay. I instead need to learn how to be more effective in managing how I deal with the ways I experience my world. I hope that makes sense.

Anyway, I have not been able to work for a long time now. I have a huge issue with being able to consistently get up and out of bed and in to work. After enough of that, well you get fired. And after losing enough jobs, you just kinda say it's not for you. :/

Well, after years  of not working outside the home, I had my first day of sorta work yesterday. I say sorta cus it's more of a side gig type thing my husband got me at his job. I'll go in on Saturdays, with my husband, and help out.

It was nerve wracking. It keyed me up for hours before and after. (I didn't sleep Friday, went in to work Sat, got home Saturday night and slept for like 4 hours, and now I'm awake again. FML) I had to be around people I only sort of know, and I don't really leave the house, like at all. I was scared of screwing up, and looking incompetent, and reflecting badly on my husband. I was afraid of talking to much (which I do when I'm nervous) I'm still not sure if everyone liked me or was faking it.

184,i feel trapped ,"‼‼PLEASE READ‼‼I have BPD and the person i'm in a situationship with also has BPD and we are sort of heading into a relationship with exclusivity but we haven't labelled it yet, but we argue frequently over small stuff and it's so mentally draining. Anyways what i wanted to say is, my ex was/is abusive and she was able to hide it so so well (even to this day i'm still not convinced she abused me but most of my closest friends in my life have been trying to drill it into my head), i'm just seeing a bit of a pattern with my current 'partner' and i feel trapped. I'm 18 and a lesbian so there's a lot of stuff that makes me feel giddy inside like how we have a shared playlist on spotify etc. I understand BPD but i don't think that can excuse their behaviour towards me, i keep saying that since i don't react that way then why do they react that way but of course we are all individual with our own opinions and feelings, i just feel like me having BPD also gets pushed under the rug and when their friends (who are also my friends now) come to me about something that happened with them and how i need to communicate and stuff, they are always a lot harsher to me but seem to step on egg shells around them. They have broken the one boundary i set (i have no boundaries or standards due to being a very passive and forgiving person) which was to not kiss my friends (lesbian circle is insane) and they did just that last month... 3 times (same person), the first time was okay ish since i didn't specifically set that boundary but the second time they split on me and did it in front of me (this was when i set the boundary clearly) and then the third time they did it and their excuse was to get back at me because they thought i was also kissing other people but i wasn't and the person they kissed was on pingers (supposed love drug) i'm still slowly forgiving them for it. Whenever we do argue, i always end up apologising for reacting (even when i rightfully reacted how a normal person would) and they only seem to apologise when it makes them look like a good person. I'm just worried about looking like the bad guy when i am friends with their friends and i have gotten closer to them and vice versa. Im scared if i end things i will lose the friendships i got from being with his person. I also don't think i can leave since i am so emotionally attached it really freaks me out. Also when we argue, it's never been me starting (except for the time they kissed my friend), it's always been them getting defensive and then it ends up becoming an argument. Ah i don't know i really like this person but it feels embarrassing that i would be getting into my next relationship with a potential abuser/narcissist AGAIN. Now i'm stressing that maybe i'm the problem. I think i have been able to tame my BPD but i don't think my 'partner' has and it is just so draining, because they are SO nice and sweet in person, it's just over text and it really freaks me out. For example (i could keep talking about this) today/yesterday they left me on opened on instagram, which isn't objectively a big deal but because of my BPD i get scared that if they don't like my message or respond then that means they are mad at me, so i said to them in a jokey way ""MATE STOP AIRING ME ON HERE ARGH LIKE THE MESSAGE OR SMTH PLZ 😭"" they respond ""BRUH I DIDNT NOTICE"" I respond ""🤓 you've done it so many times STOP IT"" they respond ""what the fuck it literally doesn't matter"" in response i did leave them on read/open. They also continue to dismiss my feelings on something. I really need advice. Im not sure if i can cut them off completely because we also have shared friends and i just worry that they will be on my 'partners' side and not mine (im not trying to imply there are sides but since they are closer to my 'partner' they would probably have that bias) and i don't want their friends to message me about it. Also needed to add when i say that they did something that hurt my feelings they straight away get defensive rather than thinking about my feelings and how to comfort me and reassure me. AND they were the one who told me my ex was abusing me (this was before we got into a situationship and were still just friends) kinda funny how that is.",1711890224.0,False,3,1,nanamisbreedingkink,None,1bs9y14,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bs9y14/i_feel_trapped/

186,A borderline expat in China - no access to resources.,"Hello,

I'm in full rage mode right now... I snapped in a karaoke bar. I perceived rejection from those around me and also a girl that i have been seeing. It was a bizarre and profound reaction. I quickly excused myself and took a taxi home, without anyone noticing that something was wrong with me. 

I'm 3 weeks clean from Alcohol -  something that I had been using in excess to cope. I'm proud of myself for this. Tonight, I almost drank - but I used a less maladaptive coping technique, instead.

I really feel like i'm at the tipping point. I'm dealing with all this unceasing emotional pain, solo. Mental health isn't really talked about over here and is highly stigmatized.

How can i get better... alone? Are there some good online resources that you can recommend? Maybe I can torrent some DBT videos.?

187,Any tips to relax insecurities and overthinking?,"Hello! 

I’m having some issues lately in my relationship (obviously lol) and it’s got to the point where I really need to start helping myself because I cannot put much more on him without him exploding. He doesn’t deserve the constant screaming and then apologising over and over, and I really don’t want to lose such a special relationship. I’m going to do the healthy things, booked an appointment with a new therapist, have started running, made myself some routines and decided to make plans to see and talk with friends more (I live alone so as you can imagine the impending doom of abandonment is increased somewhat).

However I really need some tips on how to not overthink everything to do with my boyfriends feelings towards me. It’s like a cycle, I will read into something minor, like for example a word said in a slightly different tone, or a pause before answering a question I have, and I will think about it until I reach the conclusion that it’s because he’s falling out of love with me/wants to leave me/hates me etc etc. I then get scared and angry and have a meltdown or episode whatever you’d rather call it, which then leads to the enforcing of the fear that my mental illness will push him away. Even when we make up and I apologise and he says it’s okay, I  feel like he’s keeping it from me that he wants to leave. I know this is extremely paranoid/crazy behaviour but we all have BPD don’t we so I’m guessing people will understand? I just can’t believe that he loves me/wants me/fancies me.. no faith in myself in the slightest.

Anyway if anyone has any useful tips for not overthinking these things, trusting that your partner loves you and trusting that you are enough, that would be great! :)",1592231108.0,False,11,7,jmoondra,None,h9hcrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/h9hcrm/any_tips_to_relax_insecurities_and_overthinking/
188,"Medication withdrawal - feeling the urge to self harm for the first time in years, any tips on getting through that aren't straight up denial?","So like a week ago I stopped taking Zoloft 150mg. It was making me feel incredibly empty, detached, and not like myself... like I guess it helped me get through depressive episodes and emotional pain but the way it did that was really unpleasant, I felt like an imposter in my own life? Idk. Like I couldn't cry about something for longer than a few seconds because the emotions would just dissipate. I also couldn't find joy for long either tho because I felt so flat. 

Anyway! The full force of my emotions is hitting me again, and I feel like I've lost all of the progress I made pre-Zoloft. Back to feeling like a gaping wound. Everything is making me cry and mentally hate myself. So far I've tried pushing the negative thoughts/feelings to the side and faking feeling okay but that is not working and is lowkey driving me crazy. Not to mention dealing with pregnancy hormones on top of it. I feel like I'm just waiting for my husband to yell at me or kick me out or leave me for someone else. It was only after talking to him I realized that's completely ridiculous but the feeling won't go away. Gross self hatred and worthlessness feelings. I need to get out of my head and this mindset. The urge to cut/stab/punch myself is really really strong and hard to resist. And honestly in my right mind I'd know how to deal but I'm feeling so worthless, like I need someone else to tell me what I should do bcuz ""I"" won't listen to myself... idk if that makes sense.

190,How to cope with my friend not talking to me,"I’m a 26/F and I recently went on holiday with a group of young women for my friend’s 27th birthday to Amsterdam. The trip was extremely hard for me as I really struggled to manage my BPD during the trip and I have PMDD and I was on my period during the trip. I struggled to manage my BPD as I felt really bored due to being the only non-smoker on the trip and all they wanted to do was smoke weed for the whole time and they weren’t interested in doing any tourist stuff.

The first day was extremely difficult as I took an edible and it led me to having panic attacks as I began to hallucinate and I felt disconnected from my surroundings. I was also hearing extremely scary stuff and I’ve never felt so afraid in my life. My friend whose birthday it was didn’t even ask if I was okay and was extremely uncaring. My friends told me the next day that she was actually on her phone ordering food, whilst I was having panic attacks. This happened the day before her birthday and one of our mutual friends stayed with me at the hotel, whilst the rest of those on the trip went to a pre-booked museum.

On the last day of the trip, which was the day after my friend’s birthday, myself and my friend got into a minor disagreement as the waiter overcharged me for my food at the restaurant and the waiter recommended that she transfers me the money as she still needed to pay for her food. She said she didn’t want to as she didn’t want to pay an extra £6 that was remaining on the bill (even though I paid over £300 to go to Amsterdam for her birthday). She was hesitating to send me the money and her friends started being cold to me and saying “she said she’s going to give you the money”. Her and her friends left the restaurant and I broke down crying and said to our mutual friends, who were with me, that I really want to go home.

I really didn’t want to go on the trip as mutual friends have travelled with her and it has damaged their relationship due to her character, but she booked the trip on her credit card without our consent and we had to pay her back for each of our trip. So, I felt like I had no choice, but to go. 

When we were travelling back, we spoke on the plane and she offered to shared a cab home with me, but I got a train to save money. I didn’t speak to her for a week as I needed time to recover from the trip and I had a flu. A week later, I asked if she wants to go to the gym and she said she was sleeping and didn’t see my message and said she might go the next day. The next day, I asked if she wants to go to the gym and called her. She didn’t respond to my message or call me back. I thought she was going through something unrelated to me, and I told our mutual friend and she said that my friend is upset with me because I was crying on her trip and they missed the museum because of when I was having panic attacks and because of the disagreement at the meal.

I felt annoyed as I found her very inconsiderate as she knows I have BPD and PMDD, but as we have mutual friends, I decided to message her to apologise about how I was on her birthday trip and I explained that I was struggling with my mental health during the trip. She said she’s out and will respond the next day, which she didn’t. So, I went to her house to talk to her, but she wasn’t in. The day after (yesterday) I went to her house again to talk, but she wasn’t in again. I messaged her this time and told her I went to her house to talk, but she wasn’t in and asked if she is free to talk today. It’s been almost 24 hours and she hasn’t responded. So, I decided to just leave it now, but I’m feeling really anxious as I HATE upsetting people as it makes me feel rejected and really anxious. 

How can I deal with the feelings of anxiety, rejection and abandonment? It’s my birthday in less than a week and I can’t stop thinking about my friend not talking to me as I feel so rejected and anxious.",1707070053.0,False,3,1,Logical_Blueberry262,None,1aiu60j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1aiu60j/how_to_cope_with_my_friend_not_talking_to_me/
191,Violated,"I have posted in here before,  it's about my fp. I learned a valuable lesson about bpd and that's you have to be very careful who you tell this too. People will use it against you. 

In the end she made it a point to let me know that she didn't believe me. That she lied and played games around me because she thought I was telling her this for attention. At some point I had stopped talking to this person and she wrote me an email that she studied it and watched videos about it,  that she believes me. I can talk to her for support etc...

I tried to be her friend but everything was dismissive from her. Then one day I needed her help really badly as I was arrested because some dude over stepped his boundaries. She completely dissed me,  she had no compassion at all,  she was just cold and dismissive. She ended up blocking me, which hurt me.  It triggered me really badly. usually the triggers last for the day or whatever but this felt different. I even had a moment where I called her phone to scream obscenities into her answering machine. I wanted to do all kinds of evil sht to her for the way she just dismissed me. It was very painful. I'm lucky it was just the phone, I probably would've ended up locked up for the rest of my life if i had seen her. 

She's gone now. 

I've moved on from that situation and I'm sobering from the funk, I'm coming out the fog,  I'm getting to see this person from the outside in.  She was never my friend or ally. She was making fun of me and screwing with me throughout this whole ordeal. 

That's very painful. 

I've been sad over it. 

Like this person told me I can trust her and in the end she was there trolling me the whole time. 

It was all a lie. 

The worst part is that she is the one I'm confiding into about this bpd, about my pain. To know that all of it was fake, that I was just a sport to her,  her family and her friends. That she was using me so they can have a laugh,  too know that nobody at that table even had compassion or empathy,  that's painful. How do you laugh at someone who has mental health problems? 

I was going through a crisis at some point and she's telling me that her and her family are laughing at me. She make sure to mention family because I keep my distance from mines to protect them from me. She mentions this to hurt me, to show off that she has people who love her and that I'm alone. She has this guy friend who she keeps sending after me through emails to hurl insults at me and mock me. 

I didn't really realize until now but this person has violated me. Violated my trust and it has broken me so hard,  I'm not sure I can even really manage it. 

This one person has made me so closed up to the world, even more that I realize. 

I used to have a boss who used to tell me to keep honest people honest. I didn't really realize until now that he really meant that a lot of people are just pretending to be honest,  to be good people and they're not. This person is the personification of that. She was just laughing at my pain

There is so much pain. I have to keep it all inside of me, all this pain, all this rage. 

I know I'm not the worst story out there, like it could've been worst and I understand that I want to be strong for everyone but I'm tired, tired of having to be strong,  pretend like everything is OK.

I don't expect them to understand bpd but they don't even try. Some ways I act they attack me for rather than try to understand and then ill get comments like 'oh yeah I forgot your bpd' and I'm like this is a serious mental illness that I suffer with on a daily basis and yet everyone brushes it off and forgets I'm even suffering. Due to my depression and destructive behaviour I spend a lot of time hiding away in my bed and I started putting on some weight which I'm fully aware of and my boyfriend's being very mean about it. I don't know I just feel like im walking around suffering so much and no one sees it no one is there to help. Even my therapist has noticed the toxicity of the people around me and I know people will say ' sit down and talk to them about it, help them understand' I have already tried that multiple times and they all act like they know better and know what's best for me. My therapist has offered to have them come in and he can explain everything and they refuse. They do care about me but they are so caught up in themselves they don't get it and I'm at a loss.

193,I think I'm just overthinking...,"The last month and a half my husband and I have been alone. My mom took our daughter (my step daughter) to go visit family. The first half or our child free summer was okay. We went out to do things and were able to actually be alone. The last few weeks have been really lonely for me. He's becoming more distant and I feel like he's hiding something...

In April we suffered a tragedy. Our daughter was born still and it has really messed me up mentally. I've tried to talk to him and tried to feel more of a connection. But he just seems impassive when I try to talk to him. Uninterested in spending time with me. I feel alone. While he plays games and just ignores me and his responsibilities. I'll ask him to help with something and he will put it off for as long as he can. 

I'm afraid he's ignoring me because he's tired of being with me. I'm depressed from the death of my baby. I'm suffering in silence because he doesn't want to talk to me about it. I thought this wasn't going to break us. Now I'm afraid he will want to find someone else. Or he already has. I'm scared he doesn't want me anymore. Because I'm broken. I gained weight from the pregnancy and my body is ruined. My mind is ruined. I'm ruined. 

It's not enough for me to have had a terrible childhood. Terrible life altogether...I have to lose my child, and I'll probably lose my family too....I don't know what to do.

194,Talking with my work/coworkers about my BPD,"Hey ya'll,

Last year I got diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. It has been quite the road having discussions with my family and friends. At first, some of my friends reacted as ""That puts all the pieces of the puzzle together. I'm glad you explained."" Others don't seem to want to take the time to REALLY understand what having BPD means and how it can positively or negativity effect a relationship. My family on the other hand, completely denied me.. for months, just about a year. I can still hear my dad swallow his pride when we have conversations but he is coming around. 

Anyway I do have some trauma with sharing my experiences with BPD because I have had to defend my own disorder at a time when I was already feeling guilty for even sharing or denying it myself. 

I understand that sharing my own personal experiences would be helpful for my coworkers but honestly, they are not all safe people for me to open up to, so I want to be technical with what I share. I really want to have them understand what having a relationship or in their case, working with someone who has BPD can be like. 

I know I want to mention to them that I have repressed trauma that will come up randomly and result in, wherever I am or whatever I am doing I have to leave and go process however that may look. (Usually for me its having multiple mental break downs until I feel better.) 

Has anyone ever gone through this process before?

For the habit tracker just simply tracking your habits. Nothing too fancy, or something that has a lot of features that distracts you from your main purpose.

196,I don't know why I have BPD,"this is very long and i dont expect anyone to read it, its basically a breakdown of my life and how i went from a good little christian kid to whatever the fuck is going on with my life now
my bpd confuses me. I've always joked that I've was born with a broken heart because during my childhood, I can't really remember anything traumatic happening to me and I had a good home life, yet I loved sad music and I remember being very young, like 3-4 and praying to God (I was just raised religious and I am a trans man and those things did not mix well even though I didn't realize my gender identity was the cause of a lot of unrecognized dysphoria that I thought was just due to the fact that I was chubby until I was a Junior in high school) to take me to heaven now whenever I got yelled at. In middle school I always felt left out and inadequate. In high school, I was not popular and was never once pursued romantically or had reciprocated feelings for any of my classmates. And although I wasn't bullied, my roommate (religious boarding school)freshman often snuck out of our room to go hang out with our other friend and I remember spending nights crying and wondering why I wasn't enough for her. I started experiencing depressive episodes during the winter and during my sophomore year I tried to seek help because it wasn't going away during the spring this time and was met with a ""you seem fine you've got that real Jesus joy in your heart"". and then junior year I went into a depressive episode that hasn't really seemed to lift completely to this day. I cut myself daily and isolated myself a lot and started gaining weight, something that I hated because I was already overweight and hated my body. I remember praying and crying and wondering why I was feeling like this and why this was happening to me. I viewed myself as lazy, worthless, unloveable, and a complete failure at the ripe age of 17. I lost my faith, my ambitions, everything. I also realized that I was bisexual and trans and this further worsened the depression because I knew my parents would not approve. I was hiding everything from them and trying to hold myself together and ""cure"" myself by using a horrible system of cutting myself for not completing chores/homework that I needed to complete but had 0 motivation or energy to do. I wanted to take my life, but before I could work up the nerve to I opened up to my parents about how I was feeling about everything about the LGBT stuff. they got me an online Christian counselor who helped but I was still dealing with the LGBT aspects of my issues because I was afraid of being kicked out of my school or being sent to conversion therapy. I knew I couldn't deny these aspects of my identity because I knew they were things that I couldn't change, the problem was that every single person in my life was, although most not aggressively, homophobic and transphobic. I saw a light of sorts at the end of the tunnel at graduation, and I figured if I could just make it out of high school and shatter the glass ceiling on my current life, then everything would be better. Senior year I took Lexapro and it didn't really seem to help, but I continued to take it. Unfortunately I gained more weight because of binge eating and was around 240lbs, not that much but I was easily one of the largest people in my school. I had an online girlfriend who told me she loved me and then later said she never meant it when we broke up. I started smoking cigarettes and weed and spent a lot of my time alone because half of the time when I tried to hang out with anyone I felt like I didn't really belong. I felt like a lot like I was on the outside of my own life and looking in. At this point I was also very bad and still am at taking care of myself, which I am very embarrassed about and am working on. I didn't shower as much as I should, I woke up with only 5 minutes to get to class, and really just kind of blundered through life because I was using all my energy on just keeping myself alive. Finally, I graduated, and things looked like they were getting better. I came out to my parents, and my previous good relationship with them tanked. things were weird, they acted like I was this whole new person but I still felt like I was just me. This hurt because of the obvious disapproval of the true me, in identity and opinions and personal values. this is still a source of contention with my dad mostly but I've learned to just tolerate his unacceptance of my gender identity. I felt alone and ostracized in my own house and college was the way I finally began to branch out into the real world. I met my best friend, began smoking weed daily which I think has proven mostly beneficial to me but I will not deny this may be problematic as well. I hung out with my new friend and then her friends who have become most of my current social circle daily and was never in the house. I took a break from college which turned into dropping out because I was changing career paths and found my passion in dog grooming, which was great. as I worked and had money to spend though, problems began arising. at this point I had started to feel somewhat out of control of myself, staying up too late before working in the morning, starting to do party drugs occasionally like Ecstasy, ect. while at home feeling like I was stuck in the past. I noticed that when I was out with my friends and living my own life, I was happy and although erratic and overly sensitive to feeling the need to belong and be inlcluded in everything, but as soon as i stepped foot through the door of my house i could feel my mood start to tank. I only even slept on nights when i worked in the morning. I felt the need to be able to do everything with my new friends and keep up, and i deeply needed them to like me. I was still unhappy with my weight, although beginning to like my appearance as i was able to present as my true gender. I am a hopeless romantic and have always wanted to settle down and get married. I had a lot of trouble finding love and felt unnattractive and undesirable. I also spent my money impulsively and was often broke and struggled to make it through a week on a part time paycheck. Because i spent so much time away from home and didn't have much money, I often skipped meals in favor of a pack of cigs or whatever random thing i was focused on. Because i was eating less and stiffled my appetite with cigarettes, i started to notice a loss of weight. I have never been athletic and especially now since i ran myself ragged constantly socializing or working, I've never consistently worked out or really seen any weight loss. So I started to skip meals on purpose occasionally and not just to save money. I desperately wanted to be skinny, something I've never been. It didnt get to be a problem until later when i really started to drop weight. First though, in late 2018 I met my current boyfriend and although it's only been about a year and a half, I'm certain he's the love of my life, and he feels the same. However, with all good things there are problems. He had a rough childhood and because of it has a lot of very difficult mental problems himself. At this point, i had stopped taking my meds after beginning walbutrin to combat how dull lexapro made me feel emotionally at times. I didnt like how irritable it made me and i barely remembered to take my meds anyways, and i was feeling elated with a new relationship and thought it was a good idea. i don't regret it because although i spiralled into a depression enough to admit myself to a hospital for a short while. They diagnosed me with bipolar 2 which didnt really seem to fit right since the hospital seemed to diagnose everyone with some kind of bipolar disorder and gave everyone abilify, the worst medication i have ever taken. Meanwhile, my boyfriend, B, was going through one of the worst mental health years of his life, and I tried to support him the best that I could. I definitely tended to ignore my own needs to help his objectively much more serious issues. I was also doing more drugs and just got a promotion from bather to groomer and had to transfer to a new store. I was very close to my coworkers at my first store but i didnt fit in with the other salon workers at the new location. I was feeling very out of touch with my social circle and extremely stressed out. Then one day, B had a very bad dissociative episode and didn't recognize me. I felt completely useless and pointless, especially since that morning I had also slept through my alarm for work; again. I remeber bursting into tears before getting my best friend, who i now lived with, to comfort B because I all I could think to do run. I then left the house and got into my car fall apart. I noticed Bs nightmare medication and zoloft, and without a second thought downed the entire bottle of prazosin and drove to a park. I then swallowed a handful of zoloft for good measure before i got a call from my best friend. When i got back to the house (god knows how i didnt wreck my car because i was definitely starting to feel the effects) They knew what was up immediately and then I was hospitalized for a second time, only a month after the first visit. Before my first hospital visit, I discovered one of my worst vices: cocaine. While i enjoyed other drugs, not counting weed, I didn't really care to seek them out on my own. But i fell in love with coke. i loved the way it made me feel physically, and finally the persistent exhaustion of being alive lifted and i felt like i could actually focus on something long enough to accomplish it. I was a nasty habit that gave me panic attacks, made me somehow even broker, and by the end of it I had gone from 240lbs to 160lbs since it made not eating even easier. I was also even more tired and irritated constantly. Thankfully my best friend had dealt with an eating disorder in highschool and called me out and helped me start eating better again. And then B and I tried meth. It was amazing, but it was also the fucking worst. We only did it twice, and the first time I personally only had a long, irritating comedown, but B dissociated so hard he thought he was 16 again for 3 days. The next time we did it i started to see things and have panic attacks at the thought of having to go to work in the morning. I called into work and that day we broke up because I wanted to get clean and he didn't. The next day we talked when we were clear headed we got back together, him now ready to quit too. I'm incredibly lucky that we got out when we did from meth because it would have destroyed us. Its something i still fear that I'll relapse into again, even though i dont really miss it except when I'm feeling especially dead inside. I told my mom about my drug use and this prompted a visit to a new psychiatrist who diagnosed me with BPD. It's nice to finally find a diagnosis that seemed to actually fit. I'm doing better right now, relatively. I found a medication that actually works, thank god for trileptal, B and I are mostly sober, the hardest thing we do now is acid every now and then, and we still smoke, just probably too much now. I've started DBT but had to stop because i got a new job and it didn't fit into my schedule, but now im on job number 3 of 2020 and its much more loosely scheduled so i can actually focus on my mental health for once in my life.
Anyways, the question I wanted to ask is I don't understand still why I have BPD. Everyone talks about how childhood trauama can ""cause"" it, and I know depression runs in the family, but not BPD. I come from a stable home where I was loved, although not really accepted but that wasn't until later on after my mental health started tanking. I feel guilty about it, and I can't help but think that I took a start for a good life and just shit all over it. I feel like such a family disappointment and I feel like im going to be stuck on this random, emotional rollercoaster forever and I'll just continue to destroy every good thing in my life. If i could pinpoint it to anything, I would think my roommate in freshman year sneaking out of our room might have been the start of the extreme fear of abandonment, but that seems like such a stupid, not traumatic or abusive at all thing to have caused me to go from who I was before, someone i can barely even remember what they were even like in terms of personality, to the dumpster fire ive become. Maybe theres some repressed memory of something happening to me, because I get asked if I was ever sexually assualted a lot, but I have no memory of anything like that ever happening and while I don't have a problem having sex mentally my body just doesn't seem to react that well to anyone other than myself. Maybe my brain chemistry is just that fucked that sometime as simple as a friend hanging out with someone else sometimes set it off. I just want to get to the root of the issue, any insight or if y'all also just want to spill your entire life story onto the internet feel free and I'll listen to you. Take care guys
tldr: I dont remember any trauma or abuse during childhood that would spark the BPD and I fear I may have some repressed memory or something, and I want to know why I have BPD so i can get better.",1589249403.0,False,3,6,dickfag69420,None,gi1w9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/gi1w9f/i_dont_know_why_i_have_bpd/

198,"Abandonment, too scary and heart breaking","&#x200B;

kn I have been diagnosed with BPD since 3 years now. (I am 21). Abusive parents, abandonment issues, bullied at school, I have ADHD and OCD too. But as the fool I am, I thought someone will still stay with me. I don't think that is ever possible now. Last year, my parents told me how my sexual harrassment means nothing to them as it is not rape. I was shattered. Took an overdose of tranqs and cut myself. I never expected my parents to be nice, but I hoped they would be, and then this happened. That last bit of hope died inside of me. My then boyfriend didnt give 2 shits about it. I was depressed and asked him to just sit with me so I can study, he blatantly refused. He also abused me verbally. Told me he has to spoonfeed me and that I am nothing without him. He was my best friend for an year and then we dated for 1.75 years. He abandoned me when I needed him the most. I broke up with him. Additionally he was a nightmare for someone with OCD. And I decided not to date again as with all the issues I have, I didnt expect someone would stay.

&#x200B;

Then came my current bf, a completely different person. We fell in love. Things were going great. I moved to a different continent 1.5 months ago for an internship. I am here for 1.5 more. Things got bad. One day I was restless and irritated and tired and frustrated. He was trying to make some arrangements for us to watch something together on a video call. I was suggesting something else and he wouldnt listen. My anger got a hold of me and I started throwing stuff around. He got scared. We had conversations about it and he was not at all fine mentally by me throwing stuff angrily as he felt I would have thrown stuff at him too if we were together in person (there are reasons for his fear, it is not irrational) couple days later i split on him. And then i apologised. And he said the apology is sudden and he can't believe I am sorry. I tried convincing him it was legit and at one point i said ""i have bpd, i change"". next day he sent me articles on splitting. he said he  doesnt know how to handle this. (before all this he was pretty exhausted due to recurring fights between us) He said he doesnt  even  know if he *can,* handle this. Which i completely understand, it is not easy. i dont expect anyone to ever handle me. 

&#x200B;

Then things changed drastically. He has some serious issue at his home. He really cant focus on anything else right now He still texts me. He still asks about my therapy and how I am. But things between us are sensitive now and I dont see him coming back. I dont expect he will, i just wish, and hope, and want, and need him to come back. He is all i can think of. I believe I deserve this abandonment. I am damaged beyond repair and expecting someone will stay with me is far-fetched. No one will stay with me. I am hard to be with. And he is not coming back as he will be exhausted af.

&#x200B;

I have regular suicidal thoughts. I dont act on them tho, it is a discussion him and me had, and no one of us will act on those thoughts. But they are persistent. I get depressed randomly. I get stuck in ADHD Paralysis. I wish I had someone by my side. Atleast to talk to. I feel lonely and abandoned and stranded. I dont have a single clue as to what I should do next. I am waiting for the 1.5 months to pass and I can meet him. But i dont think he will come back to me, and I dont think I can face that situation.",1687404568.0,False,2,0,veeee2002,None,14fs4o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/14fs4o0/abandonment_too_scary_and_heart_breaking/
199,Never Give Up,"A lot of people post about relationships and wondering if it's possible. Some of you may remember my posts and comments about mine with my wife of 12yrs. before losing her to cancer. Once I lost her, I was depressed for almost 2yrs. Anniversary of her passing is next Thursday the 31st. 

When I started coming back to myself I decided to try dating again. A friend of 3yrs admitted feels for me and one night we started dating. Didn't last long. Turned out I was only a temporary thing, and she's an addict so I found out. Not that the addiction is a problem for me, if she wanted to get clean. I'd help her through it. But after we broke up I swore I'm single for rest of my life and stopped looking. 

Fast forward few months and friends needed a place to go. They asked if they're roommate can come to. So I begrudgingly said yes. As they moved in me and the roommate started to get to know each other, compared life stories and mental issues, and we just clicked. Neither one of us were actively looking but love brought us together. 

In the few weeks we've been together she's pulled me out of my depression, pushing me to get my business back where it was prior to my depression hitting, and has me so happy that I don't really feel the need to talk about JoAnne anymore. I will forever love JoAnne, but as one of our mutual friends put it, she would want me to be happy not lonely and depressed. And Angel has reminded me what it feels like to be happy and loved. 

I did tell her about my issues, triggers, etc. She did witness a mini-episode already, and is fine with it. 

Now, really the only time I bring up JoAnne is when we're replacing something that was hers in the house or moving something that was hers elsewhere (furniture, wind chimes, things like that). Though she says she doesn't mind my talking about her since I lost her, it wasn't a breakup. 

I'm getting off track with this post now. 🤣 Point being, BPD or not we can love in our own way and can be loved. I had real, true love with JoAnne and now I have it again with Angel. And I really do believe Angel is an angel because she's so calming and happy. When I'm feeling stressed and an episode coming on, all I need to do is look at her and I can't help but to smile and I slowly calm down. 

Granted it's a new relationship and we're in the ""honeymoon"" phase so to speak, both of us want it to last and we've promised each other that no matter what we'll talk through anything and everything as it comes up. 

And being with her is even teaching me new things about myself in a way. She's half blind (lost an eye years ago so one eye is a fake eye) and she's legally deaf (literally can't hear unless her hearing aids are in). So I need to be more patient with communicating with her then I have had to be with anyone else. 

I've been thanking her everyday for coming into my life. I don't know how to put it into words but we just clicked from the day we met. 

Never feel you can't love or be loved. Communication is key. As long as your open with your partner, and they with you, you can make it work. If you're single, my advice is stop being hard on yourself and trying hard to look for it. Love will find you when and where you least expect it. And when it finds you, grab hold of it and don't let it go. Communicate and be honest with your partner and let them know that no matter what they can do the same with you. Don't worry about scaring them off, if they love you then honesty and trust will keep them around and make your relationship stronger. But if in fear, you don't talk about certain things or try to hide certain things (triggers, episodes, etc) it can make things rocky as they won't understand. 

Building a strong relationship depends upon both parties being completely open and honest and trusting with the other no matter what it is.",1693098429.0,False,5,0,RedConradcom,None,162cg30,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/162cg30/never_give_up/
200,Am I a bad person?,"
I’m sorry if this post comes off as if I’m just putting my problems on all of you but really I just don’t know what to do and I’m actually really scared 

I feel as if I’m a bad person because of my mental illness, its like I can feel it getting worse and worse I’m very self aware of my thoughts and emotions but there so Intense.

Anger is like rage 
Sadness is like grief 
Joy is like being on cloud 9 

But all of that can just change in matters of seconds and it’s so scary, my gf the woman I know is the love of my life she’s so amazing and great she tries her best but why dose my heart and brain feel so betrayed and hurt like she’s gonna leave me or she’s cheating on me or just has the worst intentions ever I sometimes ask her if she’s gonna do these things and she says no with a very concerned tone. tbh I don’t know if I believe if she is or not she says she’s not and that she never will but…I don’t believe a word she says which isn’t good at all.


I’ve been manipulated and assaulted by friends and family and the memories of that are tattooed on me (metaphorically)as a constant reminder that they happened, I’m always negative even when I try to be positive it’s like I can never see the light of things always the dark. I can tell how someone is by the way they act and there body language, my gf also has bipolar and OCD and I’m a big help In Comforting her and giving her solutions to her compulsions and rapid thoughts or if she just has a bad day.  

But when I need comfort she kinda just stares at me and doesn’t say anything and I get so angry at that like I just wish she can just help me and make the feelings and intense emotional thoughts just go away. But that’s not her job and Ik she doesn’t have the power to do that she once told me I was kinda negative and it affects her because she’s so positive and upbeat and I’m not I’m just realistic and I think that’s valid. lately I haven’t been telling her how I feel or what’s been happening, I have a bad struggle with eating I used to weight about 298 when I graduated high school in 2022 I lost 100 pounds since then but because I would starve myself constantly I never actually put any work into it. I weight 220 3 weeks ago now I weigh 198 today she’s been noticing how sick I look and how exhausted I am but I tell her not to worry but she always dose, I don’t deserve her before I met her I was a nobody that didn’t care about themselves or others but when I met her I was so motivated to go to therapy and finally try to fight and try, she’s so smart and she’s gonna do great things but I feel as if I’m getting the way of that. I read about BPD And saw peoples that had partners with it and the things they said about them and the things the person did. I don’t wanna be like that and I don’t want to treat her like that either I would rather die.

I’m sorry if most of this doesn’t make sense I have a very hard time putting how I feel into words especially if I have to type it out 

Sometimes at night I’ll be in my room and just think about everything I’ve been through or whatever my thoughts are telling me in that moment, I sometimes wanna say them out loud to people idk ig cause I hate the fact that I’m the only that knows about it and want some comfort and understanding that sounds terrible when I say out loud, it’s really lonely and sometimes madding. I’m not violent I’ve never gotten into a fight or purposely wanted to hurt someone whenever me and my gf get into a fight I wanna talk about it and work it through, sometimes I slip up and am just a total asshole and my hypersexual tendencies make it so hard to just feel calm. sometimes she’s not in the mood and I just wanna touch or snuggle and she loves the attention from me but I can tell it can be too much and I just hate and feel so disgusted with myself I don’t wanna feel that and it’s made me hate sex and my body even more, I’m not In control and I wake up every morning into a panic attack it really hurts some mornings but ig take it day by day right.

201,i'm new here and would like to be of some support :),"Hi I was told this sub is a bit better than the other and not full of self-diagnosis's (spelling?). I'm just here to give everyone some positivity and be of support if people need it.
I was diagnosed 3 years ago at 22 but probably suffered since 15, I really struggled with the UK mental health service and my parents took me into private health care due to the severity of one of my suicide attempts and feeling at a loss when it came to support. 
It's now been 2 years since going through therapy and I'm approaching my 25th birthday, I honestly didn't think I'd make it here, I was set on destroying myself. I haven't self harmed or attempted suicide since, in my darkest days I was hospitalised at least once a week. I still struggle with my emotions but it's no way near on the scale that I used to struggle. I've cut down on my alcohol intake and drugs are a thing of the past. I've been in a full time job and found out what I want to do. I still don't have many friends, still finding it hard to form relationships, and I still feel like my boyfriend will leave me for whatever reasons I can conjur up. But it's getting better. I'm not here to brag or get 'karma' I've been thinking about my BPD more recently and wanted to see if I could help others.

202,I'm thinking that motherhood is probably a bad idea,"I've pretty much always assumed/expected I'd have a husband and kids.  I would like to have that family with love and security and laughs and support.

However, after having had my diagnosis now for a year, I'm seriously wondering whether it wouldn't be better that I *don't* have kids.

I'm just about 33, very, very single, unemployed, poor, and still working this BPD thing out.  Realistically, it'll be about a year or so (maybe longer) before I complete further therapy, and a further while to get stuff like employment and housing (I currently rent a room in someone's flat) sorted out.  

If I was to find someone who would be able to handle my BPDness, just the nature of the disorder would make me very skeptical that they even were serious.  

I'm terrified that I would fuck my kids up, mentally.  Besides BPD, there are a few other genetic things that I seem to have inherited that I wouldn't want to pass on.  

Adoption is there, but I feel very, very strongly that if I am to have kids, I want them to be ""mine"".  I know that's selfish and awful, but I know that I would have issues with adoption.

So yeah.  If I'm to have kids, they have to be mine, but I'd fuck them up royally, and who would even mate with me anyway?  Plus, being older as a mum...  not great.

Should I?  Shouldn't I?  I don't know.

203,"BPD, memory issue related question","Hello everyone. If anyone knows anything about psychology, how the brain works, or anything about BPD in general any suggestions or answers would be very helpful!! So I don't normally post stuff about my mental health issues (unless I'm just in a really bad way and I have no where else to vent but social media, then I'll do that but otherwise I won't post) but I thought it would be a good idea to post my question here. I was diagnosed w/ it about 3 years ago I would say and I've had it ever since and my mom, therapist, and psychiatrist have been starting to think I've had this for a while. But for the past 2-3 years esp this year, it's been getting harder and harder to remember things. For ex this esp happens a lot w/ anything school or college related. Last fall semester I was bran new to college it was my freshman year. I had 4 classes I was taking all that were morning and lasted throughout late afternoon. I would get the syllabus I read over it. But I believe it was on the first Friday of the first week I already had a quiz but it was over the syllabus. I had read the syllabus and I knew there was a test but I wasn't sure what info would be on the test. So I read it over that night and that morning when I got into class before it started. But when it came to the test, the test had questions on it and I couldn't remember anything at all. This is just one example. Later that semester I got a planner so I could write my assignments down. And I did write them down I even went to my accessibility counselor to come up w/ a plan for writing things down and I would go in every Monday once a week to write the assignments and/or tests/quizzes for that week or if I had any papers do. I would write these down but when the test/quiz came up I didn't remember until my professor had mentioned it in class about two days, sometimes it would even be the day before the test and then I would have to spend all the rest of the day studying, or all the rest of the days I had left to study and because I spend so much time typing up flash cards on this online website called Quizlet, and I didn't know what info would be on the test either and we had to use the info from the power points which were somewhere between 20--50 slides on each PowerPoint. And this took me all afternoon and even way late into the evening to type up so I barley had enough time to study. I even pulled 2 all nighters in a row one week. And then because I didn't have that much time to study I barley remembered the info for the test/quiz the next day. My question is, does anyone in this page have BPD and have you experienced problems like this? Or does anyone experience bad memory problems in general? Did you ever overcome it? If so what did you do to fix it, or at least relieve some stress off of this issue? I ended up having to drop out of the fall semester classes cause I got to stressed about it.

204,Is it wrong if i identify with BPD even if i didn't get diagnosed with it? i genuinely feel like i have BPD," 

In 2017 i got a psych assessment when i was barely 18 years old, they concluded i had OCD withNPD/BPD traits, they decided to not diagnose me with BPD/NPD because of my level of impairment. I however know that i have BPD because of the symptoms i have displayed since i was a kid and primarily since i was 17, which is the age where it became gradually worse, and now at age 21 has reached a tipping point.

i Have a childhood diagnosis of Intellectual Disability, and recently (yesterday) they brought up the idea of possible Autism Spectrum Disorder, and many times have said they didn't think i had BPD, however i am still reluctant to accept the idea i don't have a personality disorder.

Over the course of 3 years and self diagnosis, BPD has been the core of my identity. I have felt humiliated and excessively obsessive when i tell people i only have ''traits'' as i feel it severely invalidates my trauma and the pain i face everyday.

I have told people online/offline that i have BPD, and i seem embedded in my rigid delusion that i genuinely have this disorder, I feel as if the psychiatric system has let me down and has not provided accurate results because i am a male, and because of my disability. I was referred to a dual disability/mental health hospital as an outpatient for a 2nd assessment and will receive a diagnosis in 2 weeks, however BPD still seems unlikely to them.

The reason i relate to BPD so much is because of the behaviors i have, i can relate to ''BPD feels like having 3rd degree burns'', and i basically struggle with substance abuse, self harm, anger which is often irrational, and i don't know who or what i am as a person, and i have severe abandonment issues, i also experience extreme irritability over the smallest of things and will split on someone, from all good to all bad, rejection sensitivity, getting attached to people and wanting to marry them after a day, i've also struggled with thoughts of violence, homicide, arson, and grandiose beliefs. You can see my comment history and outbursts on reddit.

My psychiatrist told me that this time i will receive accurate results, and that he and his other 3 colleagues who are psychiatrists are working extensively to give me the diagnosis they see fitting",1588650131.0,False,1,2,babyboi1998,None,gdqhxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/gdqhxy/is_it_wrong_if_i_identify_with_bpd_even_if_i/
205,Organization/time management/focus skills for BPD???,"Hello everyone. Based on my title does anyone know any good skills for any of those? I'm starting my college classes back up again and I decided to take 1 class instead of what I was doing last fall semester which was 4. I first went into college as a full time student taking 4 classes all on campus. A little bit on my educational/mental health background. I have **anxiety, generalized anxiety** (idk if that's the same thing as just anxiety) **ADD, BPD, VCFS**, and because of VCFS I have a few learning disabilities. I was on IEP classes for math and english starting from 3rd grade on. I dropped the english IEP class in *7th grade* but continued on w/ the math IEP class all the way throughout highschool. So I've always struggled w/ math, esp when it comes to reading and figuring out word math problems. I also have issues w/ reading long and complicated things. For example I had to read a book in my sophomore year called Killing Kennedy. I don't remember how many chapters it was but the book I just looked up was 336 pgs long and the chapters felt like at least anywhere from 20-50 pages long. I think some were even a little longer than that. So not only was it really long, it had words I didn't understand so I would constantly have to look them up to figure out what it means in case it was on a test/quiz, and I would also have to annotate in the book (they always made annotating so confusing, esp in that class) and there was so much descriptive words so it made it hard to read because there was a lot of words that you had to memorize for the test. By words, I don't mean every word of course, more so on the lines of memorizing specific dates, names, etc..... 

&#x200B;

 So w/ the learning disabilities I mentioned above you can imagine how hard that was for me. And that was just one class I remember from my sophomore year of highschool. This was like this for me my first year of college, which is this year. I got into college expecting that there would be a lot of work. But my expectations were much lower than what my sched was going to look like. So when it was around the 5 week mark of school I was extremely stressed because I had been staying up late at night, so late sometimes it would be 4 at the latest and that week I had pulled 2 all nighters studying for a test. Of course I don't believe these were actually all nighters but they were all nighters for me because I hadn't done that before. What I do for studying for tests is I use Quizlet which is a website (now an app on the iPad) that you can type in flashcards and it creates flashcard sets for you where you can learn/study, play matching games w/ your sets, it'll even create tests for you as well. So I spend most of my time doing that because this is my first year of college, I have no idea what to study. I remember emailing my teacher one time about what to study for the test and he just said to study the powerpoint slides he had on the website that he posted in which didn't help much at all because there weren't any specific sections. So I ended up spending all day in the library typing up flashcards, and didn't even finish because I had one paper to write and one paper to correct. So I finished the paper and went to the writing lab so that they could help me proofread my essay. So I was so exhausted by the end of that week, that I told myself I was just going to take a week off and I hadn't even finished all my assignments for that week I believe I was a little bit behind as well so I emailed my teachers about what I was stressed about and they gave me extensions on stuff I was behind on and stuff I hadn't turned in which was extremely nice of them because I had heard from my mom that was pretty unheard of that they were being generous like that. I know if I had been at a regular college (and I go to a community college) they probably would've given half off of credit since it was late/not turned in. Well by the end of that week, still haven't finished everything and I had to catch up from all the work I had missed from that week off and I was still pretty stressed. a couple of months went by and I was just falling more behind, and more assignments hadn't gotten done or had been turned in so I decided to email my counselor and I told her I had to drop out. So I had to get a letter from my psychiatrist and therapist saying that I had to drop out and to please give me an excuse due to my mental illnesses something like that. And what was going on between that time I was back after that week off, and the time I emailed my counselor I had gotten depressed and my anxiety had gotten worse and my BPD target issues were getting in the way as well and were becoming a distraction which was a huge part of why I was falling behind in the first place. 

&#x200B;

So my main point being from all this, for one I need a new study strategy. I remember my therapist, counselor (from school), and my mom were all saying to write down just the important stuff on the powerpoint slides and print the powerpoint slides out so you can write on it. They said to underline the stuff that the professor has said multiple times in a row, or throughout class, or if they say it'll be on a test/exam/quiz later on the week. I have a question about this one. Has this worked for any of you who are in college at the moment, or were in college? I feel like this might work, and I did try it once, but I would sometimes forget to print the powerpoint slides out and I believe I had Adobe Acrobat which you could write on PDF documents, so I guess I could've used that but at the time I didn't know what that was for. I had heard of the program but I didn't know what you could use it for. Has anyone tried this idea? Has it worked for them? Or have you used a similar idea? I need a new method for studying for tests/quizzes/exams and esp exams because the exams I usually have are at least 50 questions but most of them are either worded funny to where they don't make sense, or I just can't remember (mostly cause I stayed up late that night before studying & typing in quizlet sets) I also have a question about organization for college. I had 4 classes as I mentioned above. I kept 4 binders. I would keep them at home, I would also have a folder, which I called a take home folder just like back in grade school but this time for college. For notes I would write them down in my notebook that I had if my computer wasn't dead otherwise I would type my notes. For me typing my notes or typing anything really helps my thoughts flow smoothly so it helps me figure out what I'm typing down and it also makes the process faster. When I write I feel like I get stuck and also I write w/ a lot of pressure esp if it's a lot to write down and when it's a powerpoint I know their going to skip ahead and I don't want to slow the class down so I tend to write pretty fast and my wrist/hand/fingers get really cramped up. But my interpersonal communications teacher was saying it was better to write notes than type for memory. Which I've actually been told that a lot but I still continue to type. Does anyone relate to this? If so what did you do to figure this out? I think another problem I had was my distractions and target behaviors getting in the way. And for those who don't know what a target behavior is, it's a DBT term and it means that it's basically an unhealthy coping mechanism. At least that's how I think of it I'm not sure of the correct definition. So when that would get in the way, I would spend hours doing that. I won't say exactly what my target behavior was, although it does happen to do something w/ my phone. But I would spend all day, or whenever my break was that I had set for my break time from my work and I would spend all that time plus after the time when my break was supposed to end. And because my sleep sched was already off from the beginning before college I would take naps during the day because my eyes and body would be exhausted from my bad sleep sched.  So when I was on my phone my eyes would eventually get tired and I would fall asleep and my naps usually last quite a few hours. Once again I ask does anyone relate to this? Maybe not the specific target issue but at least the distractions of mental health issues getting in the way of your work? And how did you solve your issues or what ideas did you come up w/? I believe these are all the questions I had. If I come up w/ anymore I'll edit this of course but if anyone has any advice I'd love to hear it.

207,Feeling hopeless...,"I have been struggling with BPD my whole life and when I become a part of an intimate relationship with a girl it becomes uncontrollable. I used to think I only experienced it in relationships because of how constant and consistent it is. But since I started seeing a counselor this past December (when I have the money, which ends up being every other week or sometimes every 2 weeks) I have noticed that I do show symptoms of BPD outside of intimate relationships, with my mother especially, but it is mild compared to what happens while in an intimate relationship. I was abused emotionally and mentally by my dad. He is a completely (COMPLETELY) different man now, but he really fucked me up growing up. I have absolutely horrible stories of physical and emotional abuse. I also thought that my dad just hated me or was ashamed of me. As I got older I realized his dad was absent most of his life and it caused him to feel like his feelings weren’t validated so he would split very intensely. Some days he would be a great role model and love me and treat me right. Other days he would hit me and throw me around for waking him up from a nap. I also realized my mom shows signs of bpd. Her dad used to get high and beat the shit out of her which lead her to meeting my dad and getting pregnant at 16. She gets incredibly jealous over people in my dads life and also split very intensely. I am currently dating a girl going on 7 months. Some days are incredible. I don’t overreact, I don’t split, etc.. other days, I can be so cruel... it is better than it was in some ways, in others, not so much. I can control a lot of the triggers now and have dealt with things that used to make me intensely jealous. But every other week I have a break down where I split so badly and can’t stop the rush of thoughts in my head and it’s absolute torture. I have NEVER hit he or have been physically abusive. EVER. And that will never happen. But after a BPD episode, I can only imagine that this shitty absolutely worthless feeling I have for myself is the same exact feeling I would have if that were to happen. I am losing hope of overcoming this and am really scared. Is there anything you guys have tried or helpful methods you can share with me?

208,BPD and ignorant family,"Hi all ! First time posting in this group. I just need to vent to a community that will understand. 

I was diagnosed with BPD in early March, so I’m still trying to get a handle on things. I have been unable to access counselling due to the pandemic so with the help of my husband and two very close friends we have been able to educate ourselves a little more about BPD. The only people who don’t understand or care are my family. Mainly my mum, older sister and twin sister. 

To cut a long story short me and my husband have been trying for a baby for 6 years and unfortunately I’ve suffered a couple of miscarriages. This absolutely broke me mentally. 

My twin, who I am usually quite close with despite her ignorance of my illness, has just found out she is pregnant. (My older sister video called us the end of last year to tell us all she was pregnant and my twin called me after as she knew I was upset about it and even said that it was tacky and insensitive how she told us) however today, my twin told us all in a video group chat about her pregnancy. 

I did not react how they wanted me to react. I left the video call without saying congratulations because I didn’t want them to see me upset and give me a hard tome about it. This was still the case, the video chat must’ve turned bitchy because my mum started texting and so my husband called her to explain. She spent around 10/15 minutes complaining about me and saying that I’m “out off order, that I’m shutting my family out, and that I need to get over it (those exact words)...” obviously more was said but for the sake of my sanity I won’t be writing it all out. 

I’m crushed, I left a VM on my mums phone as she refused to speak to me, I took the phone off my husband to try and explain but she hung up. 

The only person that’s really tried to communicate and reach out was my older sister but that wasn’t without her own options on the situation. I’ve attempted to apologise to everyone but this hasn’t received any type of response. 

Just really at a loss. I’m completely crushed and I don’t understand why they just don’t get it. It’s bad enough having a twin that I’m always in “competition” with and I tell her everything, it’s worse having a family who just doesn’t get it... or wants to understand",1591561155.0,False,3,1,JustStack1990,None,gyjm8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/gyjm8f/bpd_and_ignorant_family/
209,FRUSTRATION STATION,"Hey all. Thanks for having me here. 

I'm (27 FtM) struggling to prioritize in my life. Having finally gotten some self awareness on the borderline patterns of attachment, obsession, and trying to break out of this cycle of centering my life around unattainable or unavailable people, living in fantasy worlds, being super self absorbed, venting and only talking to people when I want attention, validation etc. that is keeping me from moving forward, gaining skills, etc. Everyone is so frustrated with me and I have had to come to terms with being emotionally abusive/neglectful to my ex, neglectful at my jobs and of my pets and self. 

It feels very awkward and unnatural and forced to try to be consistent in friendship, my habits, life. I never have had serious addictions besides social media and other peoples approval. 

Im exhausted. But I know I do have habits and can form new ones because I definitely have bad ones like laying in bed all morning or spending a lot of time in my head. 
Its just that every single day my mood is different even on mood stabilizers and I'm used to doing what I feel like impulsively based on mood, or what I'm forced to do. Which is a surefire way to spin out of control or feel hopeless. I need to develop my OWN locus of control and discipline and its just shitty that my moods are the enemy when they so badly crave validation after decades of gaslighting and being blamed for their intensity and destructive power. 

Im wondering for those who are actively recovering...what has really really helped you out of old coping mechanisms? What were you able to commit to?

I am PDA autistic and have ADHD or bipolar, still waiting on a psych evaluation, but one of my biggest struggles is finding something to be consistent with that doesn't end up trashed by demand avoidance or getting bored/splitting on it. 

Every kind of routine or demand outside of my fixations ends up feeling like swallowing pills or pinching your nose to eat something nasty until I just stop. 

 Everyone says to fight depression, meditate find hobbies and get outside yourself find something to do for others, exercise. 
But I legitimately feel my habits and mental copes are like gravity or a black hole and getting out of them or making changes in life exhausts me and I collapse back into them. 

I guess this is just what recovery is like. But I've tried Codependents Anonymous, talk therapy, astrology, divination, meds (except ADHD meds about to start those), being more social, creative expression. At the end of the day my brain always finds a way to invalidate destroy or get convinced that thing ""isn't it."" The only thing I come back to is taking pictures on my phone (never organized) and writing long rants on the internet. Im so bored of my SELF. And analyzing myself and recounting my past trauma.. everyone else seems to somehow find something to do, or to love, or commit to,, even when we have the same diagnosis and experiences. 
Ughhhhhhhhhh. 

Is it really possible to form an identity and learn how to commit? 

I'm so tired from fighting myself. 

It feels like a normal life is just within reach if I could follow the steps (apply for jobs, show up to jobs, budget the money, move put of home state, take care of my body, cook and eat, have a creative routine, go on a run, care for my pet, evaluate which relationships are good to have around, spend time in nature, set boundaries, learn time management, learn emotional regulation) so I can get to a place where I feel stable enough to really connect with others and not sabotage everything or get hurt because I picked someone wrong.

 But those steps feel so impossible when I keep proving to myself over and over that I will not stick with anything, I will sabotage everything, and every single day I have a new idea about my next big project or career path or what ever. 

How do you build trust with yourself or anyone else without consistent effort? 
The only way I feel motivated is to get a FP or romantic interests approval, or extreme outside pressure and fear of punishment. 

Im just so frustrated I could scream for days. 

Does it get better? And how! Does DBT help with this? 

Consistency is literally the key to unlocking life, and I feel like someone tossed it into a vat of concrete Im supposed to chip away at with my fingernails.

210,So Stuck RN,"I have had periods of being very well emotionally regulated, mostly when I am modeling good behaviors/actions for others. What ultimately happens is I am so focused on others that I forget to tend to myself. I’ve had a few bottoms. One came during the plague with social isolation. I then got a WFH job and social engagements got super hard for me. Looking back I can almost see my self completely unwind. Stop going to gym, stop journaling, stop meditating, stopped taking showers, changing clothes, brushing teeth, then stopped taking my medications bc if I take the ADHD meds I feel locked inside my head and almost paralyzed on the outside. By this time my head had 8 different trains of thought on 6 tracks and at least one wants me to unsubscribe from life and they constantly whirl around up there. I asked for accommodations from my company and they then found a reason to fire me (Top sales rep, most customer compliments) and I tail spun. 

So I swore I would unsubscribe from life before giving up my 325ft studio apartment (bc it was mine and I paid for it all by myself) and move back in with my parents. Soooo…..my brother let me crash with him. My head was so dark and so mean to me that getting out of bed seemed impossible. Sublet the studio to someone who is trashing it and also wants to sleep with me. (Uggggg)

So now, I have done EMDR, ART, DBT, CBT and I’m therapy and have a psych and I’m still in this rut where I JUST DONT CARE ABOUT MYSELF AT ALL ANYMORE. It’s like the spark or fire went out. I can’t seem to find it. Brother was paying for top tier therapy and now it’s been downgraded to better help. He’s upset he’s not getting a return on investment bc I haven’t been able to be more regulated for the last 2 years. 

I’ve gained over 100lbs in 2 years thanks to gastroparesis from Weygovi/Ozempic/Rybelsus. 

I now have a bedroom that I operate out of and while my brother can be super encouraging and supportive, lately I only hear what I’m doing bad/wrong.

Now dad has had heart issues, step sis going thru divorce from a narcissist - she has two kids 4/9 and she’s a flight attendant with her own Truman’s manifesting in such dysfunction rn. (Which is effecting the kids)

I can show up for my dad and step sis and my niece and nephew and lately, I put the very disassociated mask on where I’m modeling good behaviors, showering, changing clothes, doing laundry, doing sisters dishes and laundry and going to doctor appointments. Did I make my psych appt this month…nope. Dad in hospital. 

When those duties/obligations end…..I deflate back into a dark hole who doesn’t really care if I see tomorrow. 

2018-2022 I racked up over 30k in debt, so there’s a bankruptcy that gets to happen, and I’ve asked multiple people to be my body double so I can sit down and get the information I need so I can file it. Currently, if I go back to work, one of my more aggressive lenders will get a judgement and garnish my wages. It’s so traumatizing for me that I did this to myself that I don’t feel safe doing it alone. 

I filed for disability bc it’s actually proving that me acting as the Geico duck in the boat plugging all the multiple holes (my family’s needs) is enough to be a full time job and I have adhd, ptsd, BPD, anxiety, agoraphobia, social anxiety. I don’t have clothes that fit. So I have mostly pajamas. I hate going in public and won’t do social things. And I’m so dysregulated rn that I couldn’t imagine working part or full time doing anything. 

I don’t know how or when we crossed that tipping line of full heartedly believing that my life is worthless. I don’t matter, I don’t want to be here, and have made certain promises to not do the thing I really want to do while parents are alive, or in family’s house. (This is one area where black and white thinking is helping me.) I care more about NOT inflicting trauma on my family than I care about myself.

I very much wish that I felt/believed/desired like I was capable of going back to giving a fuck, and taking my meds, and showering and looking forward to working out, wanting to be social, enjoying life rather than I have XYZ task that drains my batteries and takes all my spoons so now I need 4 days to recharge. It’s exhausting. 

I cannot seem to create and keep a routine bc nothing is routine. I’m pulled to take care of the kids or dad has new appts nearly every week. I’ve lost enjoyment and fulfillment in the things that used to make me happy like painting or singing. 

Everything hurts, every muscle aches. I don’t feel like stretching helps.

I find that I am seeing or aware of every flaw of my body and limitations since gaining all this weight. I could go on and on.

I’m getting frustrated at my limitations and when the frustration hits I’m not able to positively spin it to find a way to overcome it, the frustration is too loud and draining and before I can even acknowledge it and catch it to try to reframe it, my batteries are dead. 

I don’t know where to start or what to do first. I assume it’s one little thing to the next. I just don’t know how to do it when i genuinely don’t want to be here and don’t care. I am truly stuck. Like stuck stuck. 

Anyone with any experience with this apathy and stuckness, I’d really like some help from people who have been where i am and found a way to care again.

I live in the US and our mental health resources are limited and sorely underfunded and my family doesn’t have the resources to put me in a nice place for 90 days that would force me to have a routine.

211,Chaos,"(Tw: talk of suicide attempts, assault and breakups)

Hey everyone so I posted about a week and a half ago on some of these subreddits about my polyamorous relationship and had been looking for advice, I appreciated all the comments but I thought I should update on the events that played out.

So Friday of one of the weeks (my timelines a little blurry) I was laying in bed with my live in partner and he hyped me up to go on an adventure with him and despite having been fine laying in bed all day I got excited and started to get ready for our adventure.. midway through he told me that our two partners who had been having complaints about me needed him there by 5 pm (2.5 hours away from the current time but he had agreed to hang out til 9 pm) I expressed my disappointment and how uncomfortable it made me feeling left out and feeling abandoned.. (I added this part in because I'm trying to get everything in and forgot to add this part it was also part of why I wanted to talk written below)

I communicated my discomfort with my live in partner about the polycule and explained how I didn't feel like 2 of the others really understood me so I explained that I'd like all 5 of us to sit down and have a conversation (for the benefit of this story we have partner A and B that live together, Partner C that lives with me and partner D that lives alone but is best friends as well with partner B) 

C explained to A and B that I was uncomfortable and would like to have a sit down to talk about things because as it stood I felt unheard, judged and uncomfortable in our situation and I had spoke to him that night about it on the phone and I thought I was finally getting through to some extent..

I met up with C the next day and found out that he slept with B that night (this was the first time and he had also kissed her) this hurt my feelings a lot because I felt so unheard and disrespected so I needed to take a whole step back from the situation so I left our groups for the time being, blocked both A and B and I had a panic attack where I called my best friend because he told me out in public so I was literally sobbing and hyperventilating in public.. I had no problem with the fact that they slept together but just how disrespectful it was as I did my best to communicate my feelings.. I asked C to tell A and B I needed space and just couldn't right now.

After spending most of the night in a conversation with C where I was having a break down and my best friend sat there to be a bystander to make sure neither of us did anything dumb C ended up getting A and B to pick him up and breaking up with me.

The next day when I woke up and had calmed down and had been communicating lots with D between then and the morning both D and C told me I shouldn't message A and B but I felt bad for abruptly leaving and wanted to express I was sorry and explain my side of the story.. 

A mostly kept quiet and just sent me a link to a mental health place but said he didn't want to talk to me which was fine I respected that and I did not reply afterwards.

B however went off on a huge rant about how I apparently have been abusing C for 4 years and he has Stockholm and all this stuff and then told me to disappear.. for that day it really really got in my head and I found everything unbearable my brain hyper fixated so I shut off my location on everything and went to get medication and I wrote a note with no ill will or hard feelings to anyone inside just letting people know I always loved them and that I was sorry I had to do this.. I had blocked B on some social media but then she started going off texting me unprompted making it go into my head harder..

I had been messaging D all day and he could tell I was not alright and I took a lot of medication after a while and asked if he was scared to die.. I felt extremely alone.. word got out to everyone and my best friend rushed to my house and C got A and B to drive him to my house.

B came into my house and tried to lunge at me, I had to slam the door to separate us as I'm a passafist and don't like conflict and I was very confused why she was trying to attack me after telling me to disappear and telling me I had no redeeming qualities..

Once she left the house I came out and realized my phone was gone so I went upstairs and opened the front door to ask C if he had my phone and B was closed by and lunged at me again, again I made a barrier by slamming the door and things are a blur but I think I hit her with the door because I remember once I opened it again A got in my face but he didn't touch me so I can at least respect that.. 

C did have my phone so I had went outside to get it from him and I was standing near him and like balling my eyes out and my best friend showed up, B attacked me again but this time I had no wall to put between us she was grabbing and pulling me but a cop had shown up and saw it and he shoved her away from me and told her to go to her car.. I was urged to press charges but I have chose not to do this because I just want peace not violence.. I'm exahusted..

Once in the hospital they went through the normal steps of poison control and all that I won't go into too much detail but my best friend stayed with me til really late at night (she has a child and her brother isn't old enough to watch him for too long) 

The next day I spoke to the psychologist who deemed me not a threat to myself and let me leave but she has put me on a waiting list for a DBT program and I was already waiting on a counselling appointment on the 10th so she was happy with that. She told me she believes I did my best by stepping back from a situation that had triggered a lot of emotions so I didn't blow up and that I also made the steps to resolve the issue afterwards and she told me that I can't control how others react to what I say.. she's right but it's still hard..

Since then I have had 0 contact with A and B, C has visited a couple of times and I've been doing my best.. D and I message every single day and he's visited over night once and has also had a long phone call with me.. he's been my biggest support and every time I see or talk to C it feels suffocating.. I can feel his disinterest and it hurts.. anyways I just guess I wanted to give an update so I didn't leave anyone hanging since I know there's replies I hadn't gotten to because everything happened so fast.. anyways I'm single now and trying to find some kind of motivation to live.. I want to be motivated but as it stands breathing is even exhausting and I'm only living because other people don't want me to die and I know that's no way to live.",1712535842.0,False,5,1,PsychoLittleKitten,None,1byk0yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1byk0yj/chaos/
212,I need help,"Hello everyone,

I'm reaching out for help because my BPD is lately becoming more severe (I had a relatively calm period for a year). I see a therapist and a trained social worker once a week for some time already, I'm also on quite high dosage of psychiatric medication at the moment (to the point it negatively affects my performance).

There are huge improvements on my ability to handle intense emotions, lately however, they grew to the point I'm worn-out and they've become too strong for me to cope with. I seek help but it doesn't make me better for long. On Monday, I'll have an appointment with my psychiatrist and I consider getting sectioned. 

The reason to it is my relationship. We've been together for 16 months and now I found out that his perhaps closest friend I know personally, is a girl he once had feelings for before we started dating and supposingly stopped as we'd become a couple. I knew about it and asked about it during our relationship, however he said it was someone I've never met and he doesn't talk to anymore. 

I know he loves me, he deals with my BPD that causes him a lot of stress and we talked it all through several times. I just can't stop feeling betrayed by the lie, no matter how much I rationalise. It took me so long to develop trust to him but now it's all broken. He's willing to break the friendship, he agreed on followings my boundaries that now I've decided to set. 

It's not the only time he would lie to me, when it comes to his female friends. He knows how it worries me. I don't have any proof or reason to think he'd cheat. It's also that lately I've come to realise how hard I try and push myself in the relationship and I see in many ways he doesn't appreciate it enouch and doesn't really try himself. Now he's promised he's going to change it when I told him how I feel. 

My emotions just won't stop being too extreme, my mood swings unpredictably and rapidly, I feel hurt and betrayed and I don't know how to cope with my feelings. For a few hours I feel it's not that bad, that it's my fault and it feels as if I could easily solve it, then I go extremely down as see my boyfriend as he were Judas and overthink without being able to put myself in ease anyhow. 

Please, I need to talk to someone who struggles with BPD too and can relate to those extreme, improper to the situation emotions. Please, I want to know what others do to make it bearable, to handle it without damaging the relationship or getting admitted to the mental clinic (as it happened to me many times). I consider sectioning as the last option.",1556209652.0,False,3,1,Ironical80slut,None,bhanhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/bhanhn/i_need_help/
213,How can I get over an ugly breakup?,"I fell in love with my ex early June, we were madly in love, I moved in after two weeks. Arguments over shitty stuff started to appear, mostly from me. Whenever I didn’t get what I wanted, I threatened to break up or commit suicide, more than 10 times till he couldn’t handle my abusive, manipulated behaviors anymore. We broke up late September. He packed my stuff and kicked me out of his apartment. I went through hell, missed him every day, hated myself every seconds. I then diagnosed with BPD, it explained all what happened. After 3 weeks of having therapy, I saw him again and asked if we could have another chance, he agreed. We were in love again, heaven was real to me. After a week or so, patterned thoughts and behaviors came back, again. He was so patient with me, he was there for me most of the time, he comforted me as much as he could. One day, when he was horny and wanted to put fingers in my butthole, I said no because anal sex is not my thing (he tried it before and I ABSOLUTELY fucking hate this), he still did it until I had tears in my eyes. Yeah, sexual assault. I have PTSD since then, including hallucinations. He was begging me for forgiveness, I said yes because I love him so damn much. Sadly, I couldn’t get over it. Whenever we argued, I threatened to call the police cause I cannot handle this shit anymore. I’m scared of men somehow. He said if I reported, he would lose everything. 5 days ago, when I was out with a friend, he locked me out with any signs, he messaged me saying that we were breaking up, he was going away, that he packed me stuff and I could get it back in the next 3 days. I couldn’t breathe AT ALL, I was in a terrifying panic attack, my heart shattered into dust. He blocked my number, Facebook, removed my shared Disney+ account, he just disappeared. The second nightmare came to me, even worse than the one in September cause this happened all of sudden, I wasn’t prepared for this. I also found out that the last week we were together, he tried to gather evidence showing my love for him (kissing pictures of us), I know he will use them against me if I’m gonna report his act. It hurts me like shit cause I don’t wanna hurt my loved one. I could imagine now I’m an enemy to him. BPD turns me into an abuser, I have to deal with this every day. I still want him back but it’s too late, he said he never wants to see me again. He is now having BPD as well, along with ADHD and GAD he already had. I realized we both have mental illnesses, his would trigger mine all the time and vice versa. He cries a lot, hits his head, screams and punches wall. I know it’s time to let everything go but I’m still obsessed with the thought of having him back once again. This is ridiculous, we both hurt each other so much, we are abusers. Should I report him or not? I’m confused, tired, I miss him every minutes. Love and hate at the same time is the worst thing to have in this world. I couldn’t sleep since he assaulted me and after the breakup, I cannot eat, I look horrible. I just want peace, just peace. What should I do?",1577771599.0,False,2,5,pandabear2809,None,ehyqyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/ehyqyk/how_can_i_get_over_an_ugly_breakup/
214,Venting," 

Im sitting here writing to myself again. Everything is falling apart. I feel weaker than ever. I feel like my mom hates me. She said that I am a shame to my father who abandoned me and that she has done nothing as a mother. I have never felt so much pain in my life. I sobbed like a toddler in front of her. Because she knows that I blame myself for my father leaving me. She knows how much I fear abandonment. So for her to confirm that even my abusive and alcoholic father would be ashamed of me hurt more than anything could ever. She said “look at you, I did nothing.”She feels like she failed as a mother and in result of that I am a failure of a daughter. We failed each other. after I told her how I felt and opened up to my struggles she didn’t respond to anything I said and only made an issue out of the fact that if anyone were to find out about what’s going on all the blame would be put onto her. While I opened up to her about my bpd diagnosis and how I feel on a daily basis she was only concerned about how it would make her look as a mother. She says every-time I have a breakdown its the same story and same excuses. Which is true because none of these issues have ever been truly addressed and worked on. I can sit here and provide reasons as to why but it would sound like excuses and manipulation so I give up. I failed and I am a shame just like my father to her. She says my father still controls me and its true. I just don’t know how to stop it. I want to get help but all outpatient treatment options have several week/month waitlists, and although I have signed up for them I feel like I don’t have that time. She wants change immediately. She wants me to go cold turkey and suddenly change my life around to happiness and butterflies. Because if other people can do it so can I. But I just don’t believe that. No matter how much I try I just cannot. 

She thinks that I purposely do things to disrespect her (smoking weed). I know that smoking weed is destructive, it is my addiction. She believes that addiction is a choice. She kept saying if I wanted to change I would. To her it is simple. She does not understand the complexity of my mind and the things it makes me do. She believes that I am purposely manipulative. She thinks I don’t want to put in any effort. She thinks I am choosing to be a victim but she doesn’t understand that trauma traps the person in a victim mindset. That a person with untreated trauma is constant living in the exact state of the time of trauma. They are stuck reliving the trauma if it is untreated. She doesn’t understand how it affects the brain. She doesn’t understand that not everyone is the same. That just because she was able to deal with all of her trauma (that was  much worse than mine) doesn’t mean that I can do the same. I am not the same as her, but she expects me to be. She doesn’t understand that my thought processes are corrupted and that in order for me to regain control of it I NEED therapy, I need to learn how to unlearn and rewire my brain to adopt healthy coping mechanisms and thought processes. She doesn’t believe that therapy can help you help yourself. She believes its all a business and that people use mental illness diagnosis as an excuse for their bad behaviour. She keeps telling me to help myself but I literally cannot do it on my own. She keeps telling me to do the same thing over and over again expecting a different outcome. Dealing with my trauma alone will never work. I can accept that but she cannot. 

I am sick and she doesn’t understand that. Because she is angry at me and angry at herself. Angry at me because she thinks I don’t want to put in any effort and angry at herself for creating a child like me. 

I feel alone. And I feel like all of my negative thoughts about myself were confirmed by her. Because I don’t think that people understand to what degree people with BPD hate themselves. The self hate is debilitating and constant. Ever since I can remember I have absolutely hated everything about my being. And when you don’t care for yourself, you make decisions that reflect that. The self destruction I engage in is not intended to hurt others it is only intended to hurt myself, because I feel worthy of hurt and pain. When I am in these long periods of numbness it is true I lose my sense of empathy. All sense of any emotion. And it causes me to hurt her. Because I am unable to even consider her feelings. I am sick and I hate it. I hate what I do.

I understand her anger because it is the same way I feel about myself. I just wish she could understand me. I wish we could break the wall in-between us. But every time she says things out of anger it makes me want to build the wall higher and stronger.",1652030374.0,False,14,7,ImpossibleBicycle249,None,ul6h66,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/ul6h66/venting/
215,GRR and WOO,"Hi all, 

Just want to vent about some unprofessional ladies at the bank and how good it felt to realize i managed my emotions successfully today.

I'm a late bloomer and have never had this kind of success since diagnosis over a decade ago. (It was possible sooner, but the time is now.) 

P. S. This is real hope to me and there's no one else to share it with, so thank you for any support. Also, it made me feel all sorts of positive, so i wanted to share that with you guys to make more real hope.. Hopefully.. 

Didn't hurt myself, explode, or smash stuff to dissipate my suffering this time and am still okay 7 hours later.. 

Like for real.. Not buried-down-deep okay, but weight-lifted, fire-put-out, truly resolved okay. 
 
Today in the bank i overheard a lady suspiciously say that ""she was hungry."" 

Sounds stupid, i know.

So i turned and caught a customer, a thin white lady, go quiet while smirking and a bank employee quickly whip around so her back was to me. 

I'm the only chonky monky around, (My likeness https://imgur.com/a/qcx5aor) it wasn't near food time and i shouldn't have been able to hear from where i was standing.. The only sense it made, was she was being unprofessional and it PISSED me off. 

Then, after getting to the teller and politely asking for help, she frikked with my head by boggling her words until my mind spun and literally went blank. 

Now I was ANGRY and trapped. 

She kept acting like i wasn't being clear and it felt like she was hoping to see me explode. (No explosion, but I did say ""i hate this bank"" maybe not so under my breath on the way out?) 
 
That's part of my vent. I'm really upset by people who can tell someone is mentally ill or has an impediment and messes with them anyway. 

My thoughts were transfixed on those women acting like high-school girls in suits, getting paid to insult me!  

Emotions were wiling, wrecking my fine day. I *needed* to scream/fight/cry/hate myself out of the hurt;  FUUU*************! 

Got back in the car. Parked at the next shop and just breathed so hard and deep, whilst laden with pain and hurt. My anger was justified; i was seething. (It used to end in me swear-walking up the road.) 

But i got to talking in my head, which eventually lead to saying how angry and hurt i felt by those people's behaviour. 

Then all these alternative, forgiving reasons for their BS popped in my head and there was an intermission of angry, self argument about it.

But then actual reason came from that and helped me realise the teller had used *word-salad*, which is why i felt out of whack, and the other employee must have been abusing her ""sales charm"".. 

Before coming to germs with that, i was ""weak, stupid and same old me again"" mixed with ""same effen world with the same effen A hole B words!"" 

It was a relief to be able to name it instead of blame it. 

For the first time, instead of the day being poisioned, leaving me suffering inside for 8+ hours, it only took like 40min or so for the hurt, anger, guilt and resentment, to be accepted and dealt with. I got 2 pangs later on; where the memory usually comes back and builds up emotion until i explode.. But I'm ACTUALLY still fine. 

Those ladies treated me unfairly. I felt unable to stand up for myself, yet did the best i could actually do. 

All i want to know now is how to turn all that emo into a killer revenge body instead 😂

Update: Kerfuffle at pizza shop tonight. Almost cracked a bolt bc of everything that happened today. However today also helped me handle the situation better. Still have to work on seriousness though. Made me more aware of how old emotions try to latch onto new ones. ✌️Also, share any thoughts, i do want your attention and to hear what you have to say if you want.",1589867442.0,False,8,2,angrychickentitties,None,gmiqat,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/gmiqat/grr_and_woo/
216,"Moving out soon, many questions","Posted this in one other group. Hoping posting in two, someone can help out:  Hello everyone. So there is obviously a big change in my life and by the title, I'm moving out soon w my bf. He is thank god very understanding of this condition, told him which type of EDS I have and we've of course made accommodations as to what I could do around the house to help out. I told him it's most likely that I won't be getting a job any time soon after I move out because of this, and also we (as in doctors/the us) won't know how long covid will last and because of me having a weak immune system from having surgery, I just don't trust anyone or anywhere to be safe for me to be going out, letting alone getting a job. There's this factor plus the fact that I did have a couple of jobs my junior year, one was what was supposed to be a trial run, the other an actual job. I managed to pass the interview but they only kept me for 3 days total. And while they paid me for those 3 days, the manager for my kennel crew, (it was a dog adoption place at the mall, really didn't think it was going to be bad, but thoughts were ofc otherwise,) and the kennel person told me that the manager of the store said my work was ""crappy and not good enough"" to be apart of the team so they let me go. And my mom and I figured that before I got hired it was prob best not to say anything about my hEDS or any of my other physical/mental health problems, but we've learned I prob should say something about it in the future. So there was this incident w jobs in the past the other one was supposed to be a trial one and this was in the beginning stages of my parents (mostly my mom and I) figuring out i had BPD (borderline personality disorder). So that disorder itself just makes your mood swings much much higher than everyone elses. For ex lets say the normal scale of everyone's negative moods, and this could be any neg mood, is 1=10, mines 100-1000 this sounds like an exaggeration, but if you've heard or read anything about BPD you would know this isn't because me and others like me experience all neg moods, even positive/happy moods in extreme. So because of this the day of my trial run for my first job, which once again I was even able to pass the interview, and I had just broken up w my first ever bf (now ex, but best friends currently) and because I knew this wasn't his fault for him leaving me (the gen reason was because it had to do w his ex pushing him to leave for him in order to see his son, which turns out later he found out wasn't his at all,) and because of this, devastated ofc, crying the whole day, crying all night before, was the latest i had ever stayed up at the time. And so because i was just so messed up the next day and the day before the trial run the manager of the kennel had me do a couple of things just to see how things were, my body was extremely sore, the most sore I had prob ever been since I had quit dance. Which was huge because I had quit dance in 2014, and this was the year in 2016. Anyways, because of this decided not to do the trial run, ofc I didn't explain too much of my situation. Told her was in bad pain from the day before both men/phys exhausted, (although this was true) and that I couldn't make it to the run. So w all this being said and I did explain every bit to my bf of what happened w my job history he said I could just do some things around the house. The biggest thing he said he would ask me to do was the laundry and then besides that I could just do small chores which I thought was very generous of him. Ofc being me, I felt bad at first that he was making all the money for the house and even though I had been explained by my mom and dad that many couples one works and the other stays at home doing small household chores and they turn out just fine, but I still felt bad. Later, which is present day I don't feel as bad, but I do wonder, w me having hEDS, and being in pain now what seems to be everyday some days ofc worse than others, but it's hard for me to even do things for myself. Is there anyone in this group (which I'm sure there is,) that has moved out recently, and has my type of EDS, my question being that what have you had to prepare for, what things have you had to adjust even after discussing w your partner (if moved in w someone,) and what are some tips or things I need to look out for? I'm looking for all answers, no matter how long I'm willing to read them and respond.

217,"Friend(25M) of my flatmate(27M and me(24F) keeps making advances and suggestions at being sexual with me, I came close to kicking him out several times.","OK so this weekend was Friend's chance to show that he could behave himself and he totally fucked up.

**Tl:dr - male friend going through relationship issues, alongside potential sex addiction, tries to make out with me/get sexual/convince me to follow suit giving excuses etc.**

A little history on first time (cliff notes): me, flatmate, Friend and GF have dinner together in my flat. Dinner/chatting/messing around and being silly moves onto some drinking and a game of spin the bottle. Dares started off too extreme and were mostly sexy or sexual in some way so as game progressed, things just got more and more out of control. There was a lot of tension between me and Friend (I admit I find him attractive but him being with GF vastly outweighs any notion of me disrupting that with malicious intent). Tension also between me and GF as we're both also Bi. So everyone was being touchy/cuddly with everyone. 
*important note to remember* ALL NIGHT at any time something sexual occurred between Friend or GF with either me or flatmate, consent was ALWAYS asked for and given before amything went ahead and if anyone didn't agree or feel comfortable, the idea was changed to suit.

Flatmate gets tired so me, Friend and GF go back to their house so as not to disturb the rest of the night. Back to their's, all still drunk and on some MDMA at this point. They both start on speed once at their house, whilst continuing to drink, I start to slow down, mainly smoking weed and having drinks more slowly, enjoying the night rounding off. Friend keeps being sexual and kissing me whenever GF isn't in the room, telling me to initiate/convince GF into a 3some. She seems to give consent for Friend to go ahead with me but doesn't want to get into things, becomes very off, wanders off, sees a couple of things me and Friend did at some point. I notice that she had disappeared to the bathroom roughly 20mins ago after saying she was going to the loo once returning from a walk. I go to check on her, discover her on bathroom floor, blood everywhere and slice across her wrist/hand.

Not seen spoken to either since getting dropped home after helping Friend keep her stable until medics arrived, took her to AnE, he followed some time after, not before making FURTHER advances on me after maybe 2 hours of his GF slicing her arm because he craves physical comfort and validation and his instinct is to get it sexually. Because of a history and mental health struggles of her own (obvs), GF doesnt have sex with Friend on a majority.

SO, as mentioned, this was his chance to make it right. It had been a weird evening all around, a lot had happened in under 12 hours and he has apologised several times. I was willing to move on. Flatmate had met him and other friends for some drinks, flatmate ended up being assisted home by Friend and someone else (lets call him Guy) so he could start to sober a bit but not have to stop socialising. Everything fine until, as suspected, Friend asks to speak to me privately to give me an update on GF (I am the only one other than couple of their family members that know what she did and all events) and their general relationship. Didnt mind this happening so we went into my room as this is the only place for privacy when guests are over. He starts talking, apologises again for our last interaction, although still making statements saying how he doesnt regret it, only the consequences that its caused. He goes to give me a hug which I allowed (im cuddly in general with friends), and he tries to kiss me again.

OK shameful confession, I kissed him back for about 1 maybe 2 seconds before pushing him away and telling him that was the last he was every gonna get, trying to play it off jokingly hoping he would leave it there and back off but he holds onto me and tries again and I have to actually push him and firmly tell him no, reminding him that he was in my house. He also asked, when i went to use my bathroom (i have an en suite), if he could watch, and then if he could listen after being told no (We're open when it come to talking about sexual things as a friend group, no kink shaming people). Leading to me running the tap during all other trips to the loo that night. IN MY OWN FLAT. 

Anyway, I made us move into the front room/kitchen to avoid further advances in a shared space. At some point I went to go an put some shorts on so I could show Guy the tattoos I have on my legs and friend took it that I was purposefully showing myself off, taunting him, eliciting looks from me telling him to fuck off. Further down the line all 5 of us were sat on the sofa, arms round each other, having a moment as you do with friends when you've had a drink and its nearing the end, Friends hand found my arm and kept rubbing it behind flatmates head, thankfully he noticed and, being fully aware of the situation, intervened to save me from awkwardly removing myself.

Several times throughout the night and morning I had to threaten him with him with being kicked out, each time he instantly apologises and backs off. I know he isnt an arsehole as a person but every time he gets drunk (and he was blackout drunk but on coke so holding it together and not staggering all over the place) any and all self control and will power he has vanishes. He isnt aggressive or loud, but he gets emotionally vulnerable and will seek out physical comfort and validation anywhere he can find it. Each time he tried something he would be trying to convince me, ""just one come one, i can feel this tension between us"", even went he left, i walked him to the door, he asked for a hug and i said no, i had to grab his hand as he reached to pull me in.

Flatmate works with Friend and has passed on the message that he is no longer allowed in the flat whenever he's had a drink or is on anything else, which he has openly agreed to. Im just so angry at him and I have told him that he needs to pick a day to come over so that I can have it out with him and he can apologise to me. No response, so i asked flatmate this morning to give him a subtle reminder at work today. I am not letting this go.

218,Should I stay in my messy relationship?,"I've been diagnosed with BPD since I was 17 (I'm 24 now) and I've done a lot of different therapies for it. I thought I was getting better for the longest time because I thought I had my emotions and everything under control, especially in relationships. I've been seeing my boyfriend for roughly 2 years and I've noticed I've completely went off the rails. Any sense of emotional stability I've had before has completed disappeared. 2 years ago I was holding down a stable and really good paying job for 3 years and I think they liked me considering they trained me in every department and would always complement my work. I also had lots of friends and was very social, I even had friends that I was friends with for 9 years (there would be a few years in between where we wouldn't talk because of them moving or just different life pathways but always found our way back to each other). I also was in university and bought a car from the dealership and my credit score was really amazing too. I really felt like my life has direction at that point. That was until my dad got his second DUI and went into rehab and came out of rehab doing meth and completely flipping out. That's when I met my boyfriend. It was such a a rough time for me, I had to talk to the cops a lot and get a restraining order against my dad for awhile. My boyfriend was unlike anyone else I dated, he didn't try and force me to have sex and I waited awhile before hooking up with him, and even before we had hooked up he was there to support me through everything! I was so appreciative and really fell in love because I thought he was so compassionate. He had recently went through a break up so I had a sneaking suspicion I was a rebound and I just wanted to know where he and him stood. He promised me I wasn't a rebound and he hadn't talked to his ex for a few months. My BPD started flairing up and I went through his phone (I'm sorry I know it's bad but I developed this bad habit from my last ex being with him for a whole year and trusting him but seeing millions of girls messaging him till I finally had a hunch and checked and was mortified, I just didn't want to waste my time again) I found text messages between his friend and him saying that if he hooked up with me he'd basically be tunnel brothers with all his buddies (which is far from true, he thought I hooked up with both his friends but I only hooked up with his one other friend once when I was blackout at a party and I didn't even really want it to happen) it hurt my feelings to feel like he was talking about me like that to his friends and kinda made me feel like a whore. I ended up flipping and waking him up with a garbage bag full of his stuff and sent him home. We ended up talking it out and we started hanging again. But then whenever he got drunk, he'd call me his ex's name, and he called her and said he loved her and missed her. I was devastated once again, but now I felt like an easy rebound whore. So we once again fought and he convinced me it wasn't that way, just to go and hook up with her the one night I asked for space (he is extremely codependent). I was pissed and tried to convince myself I was done with him. But I'm stupid so I forgave him, I think I only did that because of all the trauma I was going through with my dad, I really wanted someone to be there for me and hold me and tell me everything was okay. He was back at my place again for awhile and then he disappeared to his ex's place for a whole week and swore on his life he didn't hook up with her and was just there to support her through a rough time (he only recently told me they did actually hook up). I spent the whole week crying at work and just being miserable. He begged me to stay with him and I did, which is something I've never done before. I've never ever ever let someone disrespect me like this before, but I felt so low and vulnerable. We were together for awhile after all that and it was so hard for me to not want to abandon him at any fight we had. We fought a lot and were pretty miserable together. I was really trying to break things off but he kept claiming he really wanted to be with me. He hooked up with a new girl he met and was hanging with secretly behind my back at his friends place for a month or two. What made me really mad is I would let him drive my car over there while I was at work and I bought an Xbox for him to use at my place and he was playing games with her while I was at work. Anyways he hooks up with her and she has BPD too. So off the hop she started tracking his location and everything, so he came clean to me about it and told me she was crazy and regrets doing it. I told him that he should just be with her and just leave me alone. She ended up needing help and he convinced me to go pick her up and help her get drugs. She ends up getting me and him into doing those drugs (we've done it before and were completely sober, just have a hard time saying no when it's right in front of me). We all ended up going on a 7 day bender and by the end of it I was all alone and the most mentally fucked I've ever been. They ended up dating. For a whole month he kept pressuring me to come over and give me drugs to drive them around and he even pressured me into a threesome. I only did it because I'm stupid and just did kinda want to be high and see him. They were absolutely vile to me while I was there and I finally got the back bone to block them and sober up. She would make millions of tiktoks about how she fucked him in the bed beside me to put me in my place and how she wants to beat me up now that I didn't want to be their bitch. She even threatened to send a whole gang of people to my house if I didn't send her money at one point. I was nothing but nice to her, swear on my life! She wanted to put me in my place because I warned her that he can be cheaty and to watch out! And she claimed I was trying to break them up. She still to this day posts about me and it's been a year since him and her were last together. Anyways, I was dating someone and doing shitty but alright. Sober, university drop out, bluey watching, chain smoking, loser on medical leave from work. My ex got me up and I dropped everything to meet up with him and to hear how shit his life was without me (hopefully) and it was. He GOT HER PREGNANT!!! And was absolutely MISERABLE! I was rolling. I wanted to laugh in his face and go back to eating cupcakes and watching bluey buuuutttt I self sabotaged my life and decided I wanted revenge on the girl for being a dick to me so I broke up with my boyfriend ( I held him back anyways, he deserves way better then a dumpster fire like me) and I hooked up with him while she was pregnant and behind her back and threw it in her face and then laughed at the tiktoks of her balling her eyes. I know I'm horrible, I really wasn't thinking right, I was kinda off the rails and sick of feeling like everyone gets to shit on me and have no repercussions, if I could go back in time I would have never met up with him. I didn't want to get back together but I ended up hooking up with him long enough that we did (the sex is the best I've ever had for some reason and he really makes me feel safe because of being there for the stuff with my dad). Getting back together with him made all my friends drop me, they were already mad at me for being too depressed and reclused for awhile.I was an ass to him though, constantly mad about him even being with a girl that was so cruel to other girls like that (even though I kinda was cruel to her by taking him back for revenge for all the shit she did to me). We were once again miserable together but I had quite my other job and now we were miserable and broke. my mom got us a job together and we started to work and save up for an apartment (I'm good at saving, he blew my money and his). I ended up having to borrow the money from my grandma for first and last ($3000, which I still have to pay her back for) I was also the only one allowed on the lease because of my good credit score and before we moved in, while I was working over time, he was looking at the girls onlyfans. Turns out he used his first paycheck to subscribe and look at her shit. It was a big blow up fight and he told me he only wanted to see if she was posting their videos they made together. We already had the apartment lined up so I forgave him and told him to just be honest with me and to never do it again. By that point I was so angry and resentful towards him, I was miserable everyday. He refused to cuddle with me or be affectionate with me at all or even have sex with me. I started becoming an angry violent alcoholic and we started to go at each other. I fucked his teeth up and he left me all bruised up. Our apartment was disgusting, he never helped me clean or cook or do laundry, he just played videogames and ignored me. He also brought his dog that he got with him and that girl together to our apartment and it wasn't house trained so it peed on everything. The dog peed on the couch I bought so much that I had to pay to throw it out. It peed on my Tv remote, laptop, bed and pillows, like literally everything. I dislike dogs because my parents would get aggressive rescues when I was a child that would attack me and I grew up to find them loud, obnoxious, and gross. I was the only one cleaning up after his dog. I found him on onlyfans again buying a bunch of girls content when he couldn't pay his phone bill that was in my name since he had no credit to get a new phone ( I got him a brand new phone and a phone plan), and he was even short on rent most of the time. He literally would beg them to meet up and everything. I was officially numb and done. I tried for a whole week to break up with him sobbing and begging for me not too, he begged me to give him one more month and I agreed. But then his dad died. I was such a a cunt to him though when his dad was dying because of the onlyfans stuff and I dislike dogs and his mom has 13 dogs and her house is covered in piss, shit, dirt, and dog hair. The dogs literally pee on everything. So I tried to support him from a distance, even though I drove him to the hospital and made sure to buy his dad blanket and slippers and soup when he couldn't eat the hospital food. But when it came time for us to wait out his death at his mom's place, I really didn't want to be there for him. I wanted to be able to come during the day but then spend the night at my parents place which was 10 minutes away. But he made me stay and we fought a lot. After his dad past, since we took so much time to take care of him we ended up losing our jobs. I instantly applied for welfare to make sure we could still pay rent, he on the other hand didn't. So I had to borrow money from my mom to pay his half of the rent. I also had to start going to the food bank and he refused to come with me even though I was anxious. I had to make him apply for welfare to help me because he refused to let me have my friends move in for us to be able to pay rent. Eventually I had enough and broke up with him and instantly hopped into a new relationship. I spent the whole month away from him anxious and feeling like shit, he was absolutely miserable and missed me and called me crying everyday. I ended up finding out I was pregnant with his kid (break up sex 🙄) and so I got back together with him and ended up  misscarry on Valentine's day, which was not my worst Valentines day lmao. But since getting back together he's made major improvements and swears on his life he wants to spend the rest of his life with me and I hates himself everyday for what he did to me. He has made major improvements but now I'm so broken and fucked up, I've become just like him when he was treating me like garbage. We had to move into his mom's place since my dad started doing meth again and I have another restraining order against my dad. I just feel triggered constantly at his mom's place. So should I even bother staying with him at this point? He has changed a lot, but now I'm extremely toxic and miserable. I don't know anymore if I'm dumb for believing him still and if I should just get a backbone and leave for good?",1714374244.0,False,1,5,constellationcapra,None,1cfsqxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1cfsqxh/should_i_stay_in_my_messy_relationship/
219,What should i live for !?,"My life is a miss 
My family is extremely dysfunctional 
My mom doesn’t care about me or my sister she prefer my brothers on us although they are very rude and very unworthy of her love and care they take her money and call her bad words like you a hoe and thats why your daughters are hoes .. 
my father cares about nothing but money, mom and dad keeps fighting all the time and never get to result..
My sister is selfish, envious and has a need to proof herself as the powerful the most respected person and she really doesn’t respect anyone but demand respect from people 
My brothers the eldest is a lazy, full of himself psychotic, close minded mama boy who is 37 y/o but still needs mammy to do things for him. His trying to be controlling over us, he has no respect for dad and keeps filling dad’s head with bad things so we can’t get on with our lives  like getting married for example he made dad believe that me and my sister are bitcheis and that why dad is very strict with us no friends no malls no getting with the family no internet with out provisions and if anyone look into my brother phone will find nudity, pictures of porn stars, women of all ages, nationalities just there in his phone on his lock screen homepage i mean come on really!???? 
The middle one is married left us cuz he can’t stand shit any more from mom and dad. He is greedy, hypocrite , selfish and he does everything according to his wife he has to saying over her and that’s why she kept him from visiting us or bringing his baby boy to visit us i have a nephew that I have met yet and his already 3 y/o 
My youngest brother is a pervert who tried to rape me one who has a mental problem with anyone he must respect or answer for, he only thinks about food and fuck and he really is ruining his future because no matter what we advise him with he doesn’t listen he waste his money on weed and then get in trouble for not paying for school and rent 

My social life is a disaster.. i have no close friends.. even the ones I spend two years studying with and we were inseparable they don’t get in touch with me cause they are busy with their lives and really no want to care for anyone else any more 

My relationship with my boyfriend is not getting better he doesn’t care about what I say and then keeps doing the things that bothers me because according to him it’s not a big deal 

Myself i hate myself.. i hate how i make me feel annoying unloved unworthy unwanted.. i want to just die .. or live alone .. or just stuck I distance and dreams away from this miserable life 

I just want someone to care for me like i care for people.. to respect me like I respect people and their beliefs their thoughts their opinions.. most importantly their feelings.. someone who loves so much that they notice the little things like I do for the ones i love .. I notice that one of my friends in work like to drink Turkish coffee every morning with milk and hazelnut so every morning i pass the coffee shop i buy it for her .. and so many times we were together and i order the same thing she keeps calling me and ask me for what i want .. like really sometimes it doesn’t take love to notice just a little bit of attention.. I noticed that my boyfriend lost his bracelet and I ordered a new one for him with the same style and color.. but for me i literally said that i want a bag from DKNY I even pictured it and sent it to him like what do you think.. but he didn’t take the hint.. one time I craved those chocolate strawberries from Godiva and he told me that he would get for me and until now he didn’t it’s been 3 months .. 

Why !? Why do i care for people too much that I give all the love and all the devotion for them but when I need that love attention and care im faced with denial and annoyed faces and the famous repeated line “ stop faking it to get attention “ or “there is nothing wrong with you you are the one that’s making you ill” 
Like why I should be strong all the time and never ask for care or attention!? Why would be faking!? Like how the hell did i fake a 38c degree on an thermometer that I used right in-front of their eyes!??? How did I fake it when I’m sad and trying to cut myself!?? How did i fake it when i am over loaded from work and it’s making me tiered and sleepy!? How am i just fake it!?  
That’s why I never show sickness, tiredness or needing anyone to emotionally support me 
I do it for myself i fake people that loves me that hugs me that just with me when I feel down and depressed.. so if i am the one that be everything in my life.. then why should i be with people why should live among them ..!?? 
What should i live for !?? ",1529786441.0,False,1,0,BBbb-1992,None,8tcs9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/8tcs9w/what_should_i_live_for/
