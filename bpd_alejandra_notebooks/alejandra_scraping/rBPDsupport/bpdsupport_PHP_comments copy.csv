Look into low cost therapy. Start with absolute honesty and see where it gets you.Â Â ",No_Savings7114,1cqnayc

3,"Thanks, I should receive a raise in the summer and then be able to afford insurance, so maybe something I can do in the meantime?",OCthuggin,1cqnayc
4,"[I found this one with a couple numbers](https://www.ochealthinfo.com/services-programs/mental-health-crisis-recovery/crisis-services/crisis-phone-numbers) 

And [this one](https://mhaorangeny.com/get-help/24-hour-crisis-services/crisis-call-center.html) 

Iâ€™m not from the US so Iâ€™m not sure how helpful theyâ€™ll be but I will keep looking.",jaycakes30,1cqnayc
5,"Figure out the things that are fucking you over the worst. Pick *one* thing and work on it until you're feeling a bit better. Then pick another and work on it without fucking up the first thing. Start with the basics. You eating right? Sleeping at night? Brushing your teeth? Wearing clean clothes? Getting sun and water? Sober-ish?Â 




You got a library card? You can get books online. Try ""the power of habit"" and anything about DBT. There's free workbooks you can Google too.Â 


YouTube is free too. Also, see if there's a group near you that's free to join.Â ",No_Savings7114,1cqnayc
6,Thank you so much I appreciate your help.,OCthuggin,1cqnayc
7,"This is more what I was looking for. Thank you so much for the no nonsense response. I think going back to basics would help a little bit and yeah to answer your question I am not doing any of those. So, Ive got my work cut out for me.",OCthuggin,1cqnayc
8,Thatâ€™s okay ðŸ’•,jaycakes30,1cqnayc
9,"Yup.Â 


Like I said: *one* thing. Stick with one thing you want to fix, whatever the important thing is, for about two months or so before moving on to the next thing. Don't try and redo every damn problem all at once, that's how you fail and get discouraged and decide everything is shit.Â 




Set yourself up for success, not failure.Â ",No_Savings7114,1cqnayc
