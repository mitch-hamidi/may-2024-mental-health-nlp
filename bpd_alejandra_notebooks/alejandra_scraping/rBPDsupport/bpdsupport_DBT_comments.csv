0,"There is nothing to be anxious about. DBT isn't complex, it's the singular concept of radical acceptance with some CBT thrown in. It's effective at highlighting your thoughts/behaviours/responses and challenges you to develop and practice new ones.

The most difficult part of DBT is realising just how maladaptive your behaviours are.

Good lucküòò",BettySwollocks45,197kvsx

0,"Sorry to hear that. But I am going to be honest with you. Now is the time to validate yourself. Sometimes no one will but you. So here is what you can validate. You made the effort to find help for yourself. You got out of bed. You may have even made yourself breakfast. Start with validating the little things. 

Another thing is cope ahead. Think of all of the possibilities (like the bad therapist) and what you might do if you run into bad situations and how you might cope with them well. If someone invalidates you then validate yourself and remember you're worth it. If the price is too high try again or ask if they are willing to meet in the middle. 

If it comes down to it reddit has r/dbtselfhelp with so many resources and worksheets to practice. And you can always continue your search another day after a cup of hot cocoa or an activity that soothes you.

We require people that actually desire us not who we let our brain think is the one. I‚Äôm not sure if I needed to actually feel the heartbreak I‚Äôm feeling to snap out of it and realize that I am sometimes the cause of my failed relationships or more so the BPD talks are the reasons I let that consume me on top of not loving myself I see that it leads me to seek validation from others that aren‚Äôt even on my level.

I run my fingers down it and take note of any marks, any holes, the different colours and how they blend. I will hold it in my hand and feel how it feels against each finger, how big is it?

1,"Honestly starting meds was the best decision I ever made! I‚Äôm on Seroquel and Lithium, but find what works for you. I started out on these and these just happen to work best. Now, I still struggle with my BPD symptoms like mood swings, but they at a level I can control. That‚Äôs the goal - Management. I used to struggle a lot of suicidal tendencies, impulsive behavior and such but again, these are now thoughts that I sometimes have, but am able to control due to my medication. The medication gives me time to react and think about my decisions before I act on them. Before? I used to act then figure what the hell I needed to do to clean up the mess I made lol. I mention my struggles because I want you to know medication isn‚Äôt an end all be all, but it is 100% something I recommend to everyone considering getting on them especially pairing meds with DPT and CBT. It‚Äôs very helpful in the recovery process.

If you need help paying for meds, I do too, look at using apps like blinkhealth, goodRX, Cost Plus drugs, and even CVS has a discount card for medication. These services provide discounted prices for prescription medications. I‚Äôve used all of them. 

Also, this is a bit of advice you didn‚Äôt ask for but from a person with BPD to another. Staying off of social media has given my life a whole new meaning.

7,"I'd suggest looking into DBT and CBT techniques, as well as grounding exercises. They can be super useful for managing stress and emotions.

The thing that actually helped me while practicing CBT and DBT is keeping myself busy, especially with the right and most beneficial things:

Consider trying out different hobbbies, even if you think you might lose interest in them later on. You can always try something new.

Try working out, or just joining classes like Pilates or spinning once a week at first .

Something i can also suggest is taking free online courses on topics that pique your curiosity can be incredibly rewarding and can be added to your CV.

One thing i do personally is that I make it a point to research any topic that catches my attention or that I'm not well-informed about. It could be as simple as looking up word definitions or diving into a whole study on a planet i once heard about in a tiktok video .

And when it comes to doing things solo, I recommend giving it a shot. Eating out alone can be a surprisingly enjoyable experience.

Pet sitting can also be a nice experience.

0,"Hi! I'm new here too and also new to reddit in general. So I hope I'm not doing something wrong with this reply but I'd like to give advice as someone who was diagnosed around 2 years ago. (F20) 
 For starters, theres lots of stigma around this disorder. I've been through residential, iop, and php, (if you dont know these are inpatient/outpatient treatment centers, or what's considered ""rehab,"" where you live there and go to group everyday, possibly with Sundays off, for 3-6 hours a day. You stay in these facilities on average for 1 month) and even the professionals there can get nasty even upon hearing the diagnosis. (Ex. I was already diagnosed before entering, and each facility immediately refused my diagnosis, and then were disgusted after doing assessments/noticing symptoms and behaviors) With that being said, it's going to hurt while you're doing research and you come across people who make us out to be monsters. I still encourage you to do a lot of research. I would encourage most people to do some form of treatment. (I understand that money can be an issue I owe 7k to treatment centers even with my good insurance.) One thing I did when I was first diagnosed was I bought the DBT skills workbook. Professionals will say meds are only half the battle. For me, they are none of the battle because I was on 20+ different ones during treatment and I just don't currently feel like that's my way of going about it. Also important: Bpd CAN go in remission. I notice people acting like their bpd will be crisis level forever. It really doesn't have to be that way. I'm not completely better by any means, but I've for sure improved since I found out I had it. This is starting to get long so lmk if I can help anymore!

I am 99% sure that I won't tell me future employer or co-workers about my diagnosis, because I feel like there is so much stigma around BPD. I don't want anyone to see me as an unfit teacher. I think that it is perfectly fine to keep your diagnosis to yourself as long as you can do your job. My advice is that if you are struggling so much that you can't handle your work, then you should maybe take a break and try to work on your mental health. I did a year of DBT, and it really made a difference. I don't know how long the waiting list for DBT is, but maybe you could ask your doctor about an estimate? Then you can decide if you can keep going or if you have to take a break. You can always pick up teaching when you are in a better state of mind!

1,"First off, the reason you're withholding information because, for one reason or another, you do not feel safe expressing how you feel. I've had tremendous difficulties expressing ""negative"" emotions such as anger and criticism towards a therapist. It's my experience that these always stem from our past experiences as children. Maybe it was not safe to express these emotions, maybe we were hit, gaslighted, guilt-tripped, shamed, or neglected when it comes to the expression of these emotions. So that's where the root of the problem is and it would be a good place to look for deeper understanding. It's very good that you have identified this problem. Therapy is about compatibility, sometimes changing a therapist helps. Sometimes the gender of the therapist makes a huge difference, we are projecting our relationship with our mother towards a female therapist, and our relationship with our father towards a male therapist. A good therapist is strong and encourages you to openly express your emotions, no matter how strong or ""negative"" (arbitrary label, no emotion is ever wrong or negative). My therapist openly told me not to hold back my anger because she identified that as a child I had to hide my ""bad"" emotions in order to prevent from being further emotionally abandoned by my parents. In a healthy family dynamic, all emotions are allowed to be expressed and relationships are genuine and honest. You need to find a way to recognize your true, forbidden emotions and finding an outlet for them. Often art is great at this.Here are a few resources to support communities:[https://www.facebook.com/groups/372949050115079](https://www.facebook.com/groups/372949050115079)[https://discord.gg/MyMCTq](https://discord.gg/MyMCTq)[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5\_k5mlP0u0Q7C6IYpkPjHA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5_k5mlP0u0Q7C6IYpkPjHA)

He said that every time I‚Äôm experiencing intense emotion I doubt and want to quit therapy. I messaged prior to the session saying I had used phone coaching to my skills group about my urges to quit therapy and he responded saying ‚ÄòI‚Äôm glad you sorted your ambivalence towards therapy cos it makes my job a lot easier - looking forward to seeing you‚Äô and that made me really offended.

0,"short answer: extremely open and frequent conversations about behaviors, a little bit of grace and maturity. 

long answer: I was diagnosed with BPD at 19, but it's been suspected since 16. now I'm married, in a ""normal"" healthy relationship. I no longer meet the DSM 5 requirements. I'm not going to pretend that I don't still really struggle at times, because I do. 

what has helped me the absolute most, is that my husband is smart, and a logical thinker. I entered our relationship telling him that I have BPD, he looked up unbiased information about BPD, read a few studies, joined a Facebook group I was in so he could see how other people with BPD act and feel. another thing in the same vein as seeing and hearing about how people with BPD act, he would come to therapy with me! he actually suggested multiple times ""maybe we should bring this up on your next session?"" or ""could you schedule a session, you're not doing well."" and as hard as that is to hear, if you force yourself through that anger and sadness, and go to the session or make an earlier appointment, you tend to see more results. as people with BPD, we don't normally feel outside of this very moment, so you gotta strike while the iron is hot and what not. 

another thing is being held accountable for your reactions, but not necessarily your thoughts. the way you react to thoughts are solely your responsibility, but the reason why you had the thought in the first place isn't on you. example: early in the relationship I had a flashback to how my ex abused me, and the way I reacted towards him wasn't okay. at the end of the day my husband isn't my abusive ex boyfriend. we can see how that connection is logical, but they have no idea. this is where a little grace comes in. your partner has to be a little lenient ""yes the way you acted wasn't okay, but we talked through it now. I understand a bit better now. next time xyz."" for me personally, making plans on how to do something makes me think about it a lot, it gets ingrained in my head and then when a situation like that happens again, it's one of my first thoughts. 

my last tip that I tell everyone, even if they don't have BPD, is to not ask questions you want a genuine answer to. what if the answer is hurtful, you set yourself up. what if the answer isn't as good as you scripted, you set up those expectations. I'm talking about questions like do you think this person is pretty, what was your first impression of me, what would you do if I died, etc. yes the answer of those are sweet and give us satisfaction but more likely than not you already know what you want the answer to be. you want them to say no that person isn't cute because 9/10 it's someone who looks the exact opposite of you, but you want them to say yes so you have a reason to split. 

it takes a lot from both people. I've spent plenty number of nights sobbing in my husband's lap because he wouldn't let me react the way I normally do, and it feels like a genuine pain, I'm having to sit with those thoughts and feel through them instead of splitting and avoiding the feeling altogether. he has spent many hours secretly upset with my reaction and waiting for me to calm down so he can get reassurance that I still love him. there's going to be fuck ups. you're going to have your feeling hurts, so will your partners. there's going to be days where you feel like you haven't gotten any better but your partner has seen amazing improvement and is so proud of you. just for the love of everything holy, talk to each other. if there needs to be a code word you use as that fire starts, so that you can walk away from the conversation until you're better, so be it! I use the word pomegranate. this is possible and I wish you nothing but luck. I hope you show yourself a little grace in this process as well. no one else could ever imagine how having a disorder that feels like second degree burns over most of your body feels.",kaprioara,1c63vle

4,"Shame is an important part of BPD. You gotta unlearn shame, dont be embarassed from your behaviour just try to understand where it stems from.
Imo it seems like you fear abandonment, got comfortable in the relationship and are testing the limits with your partner. It's a good thing that your partner doesnt react badly, you can still apologize after calming down and explaining why you did that. You need to talk to your partner about how to prevent that, what was the unmet need, what could you do instead of lashing out ? Maybe journaling, some deep breaths, a walk outside, a bit of alone time in another room, cuddling your fave plushie, brushing your hair, it could be anything that help soothing you. Journaling is usually great for BPD because it helps unleash the feelings and reflecting on it ü´∂

2,"It's a traumatising illness. You can have DBT, and for many, it helps manage ideations, emotional distress, emotional outbursts, and many other symptoms. It's not a case if you are cured. As humans, we rise, we fall, and fall many times, getting back up again with some sort of resilience. It's a very misunderstood disorder, and many form inaccurate judgments on bpd, which reinforce shame amongst us who suffer the daily pain and misery of sensitively and disregulated emotions. We only have ourselves to believe that we are not our mental health only. We are much more beyond that. We are deserving of love , compassion, and understanding. If loved ones can not tolerate us at our worst, then that is their choice. You learn the art of knowing that despite the negative traits/symptoms of bpd, it's a double-edged sword, we feel intensely, we love deeply, for we have lots to offer also, we aren't immune to LOVE, to be loved! It's important that we do not believe negative perceptions of us of this disorder that can increase our suffering. We have to create a loving relationship with ourselves. We can not rely on others for that. It is a difficult rd, one that is relentlessly trying, one that makes you feel very alone. Again, we can not rely on others' approval or acceptance. It's the patience, love, care, forgiveness, and  tolerance of ourselves that lesson suffering.

These symptoms sound very much like BPD to me (but I'm not a psychiatrist, of course). You don't have to have every BPD symptom to be correctly diagnosed. 

Even if you don't have BPD, or are on the less severe side of the BPD spectrum, it might be valuable for you to explore treatments for BPD, such as DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy). They could help with the interpersonal difficulties you're dealing with.

It's actually rarer for men to be diagnosed with BPD, so if a trained psychiatrist thinks you have it, might be something to take seriously.

ETA: Also, you can literally change what you think through practice. Meditation changes how you think, for instance.

0,I‚Äôve been diagnosed with Bpd 2 years ago. At that time I didn‚Äôt even know what bpd was but it took me one year of seeing the same psychiatrist and lots and lots of test until i got a diagnosis it‚Äôs definitely a process but it‚Äôs the right direction and it is worth it. My bpd was masked by my depression and severe anxiety which were the initial diagnosis i got from other psychiatrist. Ive been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for 2 years now and i can tell you it gets better. When you get a diagnosis they can help you with means that are specifically tailored to your needs and medication would help if you are considering them. And you don‚Äôt have to tell anyone or choose the right people to talk to about it unless you feel ready to avoid any negativity. I can‚Äôt say you will 100% feel better there are days where i feel like i am exactly the same or even worse and its a journey with lots of ups and downs. but overall it does get better over time and DBT is a great help you should consider.

that being said, your feelings are very valid and I believe I'd feel restless about this too if I were in your place. if it bothers you a bit too much, you can totally ask her, ""hey I've been noticing you feel a bit distant lately and contact seems to have been minimised. it's not much, I just wanted to know if everything's alright with us and you so that I can ease my mind.""",Adwis_jungkook,1aq6opc

""Fully-functional adult"" is a loaded and possibly misleading term.

Here's one of the things I've learned about having BPD. If thought X is causing behavior Y, there's a reason for that, rational or not. It's up to the individual to pick apart what their subconscious is trying to tell them (or maybe get the therapist to help).

Hey, maybe you just need more time to be where you're at, and that's really OK, because you've come a LONG way.

But two years ago you were undiagnosed, and two years isn't really that long to undo the previous thirty something years of the disordered thoughts and patterns of bpd. What progress exactly are you worried about undoing?  That part was unclear to me. 

Just a thought and if I'm off base, thats ok too. 

If you are feeling unsure and stuck, I'd completely suggest more therapy. As far as I know, with bpd you don't just do dbt, be better, and move on with life as a ""normal"" person. Again sorry if I'm misunderstanding your questions.",standarddev,3hg2e9
2,"1: Kudos to you for recovering as far as you have!

Ok, second. I used to really resent and get angry when professionals told me that BPD is a life long illness and you're basically just doing maintenance on it, but I think they're right after years of therapy, intropection, etc blah blah.

To a certain degree, even if you don't meet all of the criteria anymore, it can be assumed that you are wired a certain way. Even if you have learned to manage your emotions, impulses, thoughts and behaviors better, there are still going to be some times where you slip up and act HUMAN. Living with this is kind of like a marathon and less of a sprint. 

Also, recovery is kind of like treating acne. You've got some crap on your face, right? And obviously there is a hormonal imbalance causing the breakout and your pores are clogged. So what do you do? You treat it with medication. And initially, when you start treating it, your face look even WORSE than not using medication, because you are bringing everything out from underneath your skin in order to get rid of it. But after awhile, things start to clear up. Sometimes you'll have breakouts again, but they are fewer and farther between because you are still treating a chronic problem.

FWIW none of those things sound like crutches to me. They sound like healthy, adaptive behaviors.

The skills of emotion regulation, distress tolerance, radical acceptance, self validation etc. may have been taught to them better as children, or may come to them more naturally, or they may just need them less because their emotions and reactions aren't quite so intense... but small victories are worth celebrating.

If they're going to blame you then you deserve better friends.

Diversifying resources is a great way to help wean off that energy we depend on our FP for.

1,"Keep looking for a therapist if you can, it really is super helpful to have a good therapist. I always suggest finding a new therapist if the one you have isn't helping, as well. I went through several but have found one that has helped me make leaps and bounds of improvement. It's worth it. 

I have been in a similar place to you before where I *needed* to be talking to my FP at all times or I'd lose it. Time with your FP can be very addictive and right now you're taking that drug like a junkie. Try to wean yourself off time talking to your FP slowly to prepare for the coming change. Communicate openly with your FP about your plan, why you're doing it, and ask their help with slowly reducing communication time. Find out what kind of communication time you'll have after their job moves back to the office, and make that amount the goal for you to reduce down to. Look for ways to stay occupied when you're not talking to your FP. Maybe think of ways to surprise them when you do get to talk to them next. Perhaps if you're artistically inclined you could work on art as a gift for your FP. 

It's hard, but I believe in you. You'll feel a lot more functional and whole and when you are more independent you will have a more healthy relationship that you can feel extra proud of. 

I'm also in an LDR and it's been hard especially since you can't see your partner in real life but it's really valuable to me to still have a healthy relationship and when I do get to talk to him I have a whole day's worth of events to tell him all about!",sparrowlion,vhwiek

1,"It seems like you are invalidating yourself. The things that happen to you might not be objectively as deep, but as people with BPD our brains are wired differently. We feel emotions much more intensely than everyone else. So whenever a situation brings up difficult emotions, it's not that we overreact, we react in accordance to their intensity. And since for us this intensity is very very high, from the outside it might seem like overreacting.

I know it is difficult, but in these moments, try to pause and truly feel your feelings. Not only in your mind, but your body too. Take a few deep breaths. Where do they come from? What situation made you react this way? Be mindful and accepting of your experience. 

For me, it helps (if there's other people involved) to come back to these moments later and try to distance myself while replaying the scenario. This means, you visualize the situation, step by step, but from a bird's eye perspective, without getting too involved emotionally. See what I do, and what the other person does. In case of BPD it's helpful to drag out the visualization of the situation, since in our case emotions will drag on for a longer time. So even if you and the other person parted ways, see yourself still being angry, while simultaneously imagine them going on about their business not long after the event.

Rumination is also your brain trying to figure out, ""Why did that happen so I can prevent it from happening again,"" especially if it triggers an emotional response. The trick is to not be disappointed it happened, but remember the lesson. If you ignore the lesson, I warn you that the rumination won't stop.

So everytime you're haunted by rumination, just think of the lesson, and the rumination basically stops almost immediately. The emotional response doesn't always go away, but you can make the rumination go away.

Ex. Whenever I seen a picture of my ex, it would make me crazy. Then I'd remember the lesson that looking at a picture of her was like taking a bad drug or that our relationship was like a bad drug. Once I remember that, my brain stops bugging me about it.",,gx18fh

Also, if your family know about your problems, is there a way of explaining to them that you will need some time by yourself or just you and your SO? Are there enough places in the house for you both to be able to relax away from people? If not, have you scouted out places nearby - coffee shops or nice walks, maybe - so that you can get some alone time or time together away from everyone else?

For what it's worth (and I know it's so much easier said than done), fat shaming is a horrible thing and people who do it aren't worth worrying about anyway because they're most likely arseholes.

0,i Can totally relate to this. It's like I don't want to be happy around my parents. I want them to see me being miserable at all times and want them to know that it is their fault. It is so very fucking self defeating. Having shitty parents does strange things to you.,jane_avril,hkwlor

3,"If you have a good relationship with your mom now, maybe you can do some things together? 

  I'm not sure what kind of exercises you do but workout videos or dance videos on YouTube can be fun to do and you don't really think about exercising but having fun.  If you have a smart TV there should be a YouTube on there or your smart phone should be able to screencast on a TV. 

  Or maybe a bike ride together? 

It's rough but avoiding telling someone how you feel can build up so I guess maybe tell her directly how you feel?   I'm kind of going through a similar situation and telling her how I felt made me feel a little better just to say it out loud to her (even though she ignored me). 

  Or put in headphones and just focus on the music when you're doing something for yourself. 

   I know things are easier said than done but just saying things out loud and finding a way to keep you focused on yourself can really help.

1,"For me, it helped to have a diagnosis because I always knew something was very wrong with me but didn't have the vocabulary to describe the terrifying happenings of my brain. However, for the most part, a lot of therapy for mental illnesses is all very similar and uses similar techniques. Even neurotypical people respond well and have better lives when learning DBT techniques and mindfulness, for example. You might hear people mention the DBT workbook by Marsha Linehan. Whether you get diagnosed or not, I reccomend trying it out, because it has some good skills in it for basically anyone and is very helpful for people with DBT specifically. Mindfulness meditation is also very helpful, although keep in in mid that you don't have to meditate to be mindful. It can be a practice you have as you go about your idea. It's a state of mind, and can be very elusive, but it's easier to start with meditations. Body scans are especially good provided you don't have chronic pain. Hope this helps! Remember, you're the same person you always were, and there are many people with BPD who go on to love happy lives. In fact, some psychologists think that BOD may be an unborn sensitivity to others emotions and actions that can be a skill when you develop it in a positive environment. There's a possibility that the reason it effects people negatively is because they may never be taught to use it in positive ways or because they experience trauma that ""activates"" it in a negative way. There are positives to any mental illness, even though they don't outweigh the negative parts. In people with BPD, we tend to be more creative, sensitive, and empathetic, although it's different for everyone.

Suicidal ideation sucks balls, as does being suicidal in general. Can you discuss starting DBT with your therapist? CBT is fine enough and might be able to help you a bit, but DBT is the one designed specifically for BPD.

1,"Hi so i understand being reluctant to start therapy again especially if you do that thing where you tell your therapist what you think they want to hear (been there). If you are in dbt therapy though, you will fill out a card each day with things like emotions and actions, so your therapist can go over that and you will be less likely to forget what's happened and you guys have real concrete things to talk about. That was scary for me at first, having a record of all my maladaptive coping behaviors but it has actually helped bring to the forefront things I  really need to work on and started showing patterns of why I do the things I do. 

I've been in therapy since I was thirteen and I feel like dbt has been great so far because it is so focused on what is happening now and concrete strategies to use going forward, as opposed to just talking about my past and hoping the therapist likes me. ",standarddev,3gjjkx

1,"BPD is a sadly stigmatized disorder, and it's disappointing that professional bias is a real thing.

If you're struggling with PTSD symptoms like flashbacks and dissociation, EMDR could be a highly effective treatment. One challenge in treating BPD for someone who has post trauma responses is ""staying present"" during treatment; trauma therapy like EMDR usually includes practicing skills specifically to help that.",TranZeitgeist,fu914t
2,"Usually for people with BPD the best course of action is to do DBT and get to a stable place and then do EDMR or other trauma work if its applicable (it sounds like it is). DBT is kinda like crisis management skills so you can tolerate the every day, and once you get that under control it's much easier to work on the less fun stuff. Doing any kind of work with trauma isn't something you want to start if you aren't at a stable place because it's a really difficult process and it can bring up old wounds and make you worse before it makes you better. You want to be able to cope with that before you bring it all up. 

I'm sorry that your therapists are being difficult. It's so frustrating how stigmatized BPD is unfortunatley. I don't know if your diagnosis is already officially on your file, if it's not, it may be prudent to delay mentioning BPD until a few sessions into treatment. Therapists without much  experience often have stereotyped images of a disaster client when they hear borderline. And honestly it may be best to look for a therapist without such views. As much as it sucks to be turned away by therapists, if someone thinks they wont be able to treat you properly, them not treating you is in your best interest.   

If you can, look for a therapist that does DBT because more than likely they will be willing and used to dealing with patients with BPD. A therapist with a trauma background is also ideal, and they usually go hand in hand.",,fu914t

The treatment helps to stay present and grounded, when sometimes trauma could make us disassociate and anxious.

Forget the thirty years and focus on this year - what is affecting you the most right now? Take that to therapy, take the meds, and try to keep you mind on now. Mindfulness can be helpful with this - there are loads of free resources on YouTube as well as apps like Headspace.

Secondly, it's very difficult (and I would say unethical personally) to put a number on recovery. Different people respond differently to treatment and some people commit to therapy and making changes more than others. You could speak to a different medical professional and get a very different answer. That's not saying that you shouldn't listen to your psych, *you absolutely should follow their advice*, but don't let that number stop you from committing to treatment or give up hope because of it.

4,"First things first, DO NOT let the stigma around this condition get into your head.

Things to avoid:

- A particular subreddit that says it's for the loved ones of people with bpd. It's full of misinformation and anger, mainly from victims of abuse who are (understandably) looking for something to blame. Me mentioning it is going to make you want to go and look for it. Don't. 

- A book called 'walking on eggshells'. Some people find it useful, but I don't think it's helpful to anyone who has just been diagnosed.

- Forums, support threads and YouTube videos made by and for people who have not actually been diagnosed with BPD, or who have no professional qualifications/expertise in BPD. 

Essentially, there is a LOT of BS out there about this condition. Protect yourself and get into the habit of disregarding it. 

Things to seek out:

- Support forums, threads and YouTube videos by people talking about BPD who actually have the disorder or are experts in treating it. 

- Anything by Marsha Linehan and resources for dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT).

- Research showing that BPD is a highly treatable condition - you can get better!

- Resources for complex PTSD - the two conditions often overlap, and if you've experienced abuse or trauma then dealing with this is crucial to recovery. If this feels like you, you may want to consider long-term psychotherapy with a trauma specialist as well as DBT.

- On Instagram, perfectly_borderline and BPDmatters both have great accounts dedicated to positivity around BPD.

- Mindfulness. Apps like Headspace and Calm can help introduce you to this. You will find it hard at first but it can really, really help.

- Self-help books on self esteem and finding yourself, music playlists about loving yourself, affirmations. Working on liking yourself and self-development can really help with issues around lacking a sense of self and feeling like you don't know who you are. Surrounding yourself with positivity can really help lift your mood because we are so easily influenced emotionally.

- Journalling. Get those emotions out. If you're not into writing, try speech to text apps or another creative outlet like art. 

- Creating a crisis plan to share with people close to you. What will you do if you're feeling bad and what are helpful behaviours from others? Are there any alternatives to self-harm/impulsive behaviour/acting out of anger that you can put in place?

- Being kinder to yourself. Recognising that you have a disorder that centres on emotional regulation, what do you need to help with that? Is it not confirming whether you're able to attend social events until the last minute? Is it setting aside a day a week to do nothing, so you can recover from the stress of just being? Is it confirming to friends that you are going to typically be up to half an hour late because you struggle to get out the door and just accepting that? Is it talking to work and organising flexible hours, or working from home, or going part-time? You get the idea. Be nice to you!

0,"The issue I would focus on first is your emotional outbursts. When you‚Äôre having them over thinking your partner is going to leave, it‚Äôs essentially a self-fulfilling prophecy. I‚Äôd ask your therapist for more info on this first. I highly recommend DBT. 

When you start to feel insecure, check the facts. Is it reasonable to yell and scream over a short pause before they answer a question? In reality, all it means is they are thinking about how to answer. Try opposite action- when you have the urge to be nasty to your partner, do something loving for them instead. 

If you can‚Äôt fight off the intense emotional response, have an action plan to stop yourself from having a full blown episode. 
1. Put ice on your forehead, stand and lean over with your head on the kitchen counter and take deep breaths, with your exhale longer than your inhale.

I would also suggest starting with distress tolerance and emotional regulation. Once you are able to control the extreme emotions a little better, learning about interpersonal effectiveness was a big help for me. 

If you are new to DBT, give it a chance. The developer of DBT had BPD and because she was one of us, I tend to listen a little more.

I can't spend my life trying to convince someone I'm doing better or am changing. I can't spend my life apolozing for every fiber of my being. As long as I'm working to move on and be ""Better"" than that's all I really can do. Maybe one day someone will come along who DOES TRULY WANT ME but for now I gotta focus on myself.

2,"Sorry but your BPD emotions are real and valid.

That's the difficult thing about BPD, you can't just draw a line with all the BPD stuff on one side and the 'normal' stuff on the other.

It's possible to be self aware enough to know that you're over-reacting but it honestly makes no difference to how you actually feel/react.

Only a long course of therapy can help give you a semblance of control.",saint_maria,3nvwpd
3,"All emotions are real, valid, and reactions to the environment around you. 

What DBT or similar therapies can do for you is inform you when those emotions are coming from a place of truth that aligns with deeper-set values, and when they are urging you towards a place of avoidance or other negative coping behaviors. 

Bringing together a logical approach to your long-term wants and needs AND your current emotions is called Wise Mind, and it's one of the hardest skills in DBT to master. ",AnnieBananny,3nvwpd
4,"I often ask myself the exact same thing and I can never really completely tell.

 I don't think I was truly in love with my first ""real"" partner (let's call him AW)- I think he was more just someone to distract myself from being lonely. Whenever he was gone, I wasn't down because I missed him specifically, it was just the general feeling of being alone that I hated.

With my subsequent partner (let's call him RC), the love just felt so pure and right. I don't know how else to articulate it. I wasn't anxious, angry or jealous when he left- sure I was upset, but deep down I was glad that he found a better match for him. It might be worth noting that this person was the only one who seemed to be completely accepting of my diagnosis and wasn't weirded out by it in the slightest. Overall, I didn't feel threatened or shitty whenever RC (true love) would leave.

Re impulses- try asking yourself, ""what reaction am I trying to get out of this person/situation"" or ""what reaction WILL I get out of this person/situation"" and imagine the situation unfolding. I find that helps me a lot. Every now and again I'll let my impulse slip and say/do something completely horrible (this is actually how every single one of my relationship breakups have been triggered) but the more you practice, you'll get used to it. 

Lastly- write and think about it just like what you're doing here on reddit!

I feel like that's a part of DBT (I don't know if it's in CBT as well) that all people could use. And I feel like that's a part of DBT that's so hard to come to grips with. It's like I used to ask myself, why *shouldn't* I defend myself with tooth and nail, since I can? Since I'm equipped to really tear someone apart, if I feel like they are tearing me apart? At the end of the day, though, it's really more about avoiding escalation for your own sake. Avoiding that battle, because it isn't as important as how *you* feel later when you're washing the dishes. Or showering. That battle will only stay with you for the long run if you let yourself activate those angry, bitter emotions.

Until I did DBT, I never really understood that saying sorry is more for your personal benefit than anyone else's. It's not a bargaining chip, it's a way to ask for forgiveness that acknowledges that you made a mistake, so you can honor your personal views and admit that mistake is not part of them.

0,">What do you think, is it BPD that‚Äôs causing me to act this way.

Seems likely to me. It's hard to say to what degree you might be blaming your illness. But the symptoms you describe are typical and seem quite high-functioning.

It's understandable that your behavior might regress as you get closer to marrying your fianc√©. The increased closeness, attachment, intimacy, etc. may be (paradoxically) triggering your fear of abandonment even though you desperately want them in your life.

1,"Accepting/being diagnosed with BPD is the first step in a long journey to recovery.


The next part is figuring out why (usually shitty parents) and how your behaviour is a reflection of and a reaction to your formative years.


Finally, and this takes lots of practice and patience, you can recognise your triggers, understand your reactions, understand that this situation is not the situation that originally formed the trigger and not fly off the handle.


I'm massively simplifying here but you get the gist of it. ",saint_maria,875yi6
2,"I'm not saying you are using it as a crutch to have outbursts, but maybe since you're so self-aware; you could be? 

I would say make sure you're talking everything out with your therapist and be vocal in a positive way about how you feel, like if you're jealous/angry/sad just let him know you feel that way instead of unleashing abuse. I'm sure if you let him know how you feel and why, he'll ease whatever fear you're having. But keep it in mind he can help you short-term but he isn't supposed to be doing this long-term, eventually you need to be able to rationalize it in your head ""this isnt a big deal/ this isn't something i need to yell about/etc"" Keep in mind that any kind of abuse you give him, no matter if you have an illness or not, is not his fault and he shouldn't have to be going through that; so you need to actively work on getting better because it really isn't fair to him (or you of course, but hes the one getting hurt by someone else's actions). From my experiences as the victim, being vocal to pwBPD about how it hurts me, has motivated them to be better and not abuse me as much anymore.

0,"I don't know that either of these 2 points will bring you real comfort but

People with borderline have had physician assisted deaths in countries where that is offered. May be no surprise.

Second is that DBT is designed to recognize that life is not always ""worth living"", and feeling as you described may be a life that's not ""worth living"" (why else would you be desperate for escape?). One point is to focus on that reality and risk , managing to cope with new tools while building the relationships, meaning and habits that can sustain a life you chose.

I can't say why your psych tells you ""you're doing well"", whether it's communication on your part, or perhaps just the limit of their validation and awareness. The fact you were previously on 5 medications at once is a small concern and maybe suggests that wasn't right care for you; in general fewer meds= better recovery for pwBPD. I can't assume you have access to other care providers or treatment programs, but possibly a higher level of care, partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient would fit; or a different treatment approach would be a better match for you. You find the group setting increases your anxiety and emotional avoidance or dissociation?

3,"Hi, Thank you for your thoughtful reply. 

I think my psychiatrist thinks I'm doing well compared to how I am when I'm admitted as an inpatient. I'm not sure that's a very fair benchmark though. I feel like she thinks my current level of suffering is acceptable because it's presenting as an improvement on where I was before. But it's always going up and down and honestly, even with the few moments where my mood is at its best, it's still not worth the remaining 99% of the time which seems to range from extremely difficult to absolutely unbearable.

I wasn't able to leave the house, but now I can sometimes with immense distress and difficulty. I'm still having crazy mood swings that I can barely manage. Just because I'm not aggressively trying to kill myself all the time and dont require constant surveillance doesn't mean I'm doing better enough to be left without help. She's refusing to prescribe any more medications because of the bad reactions I've had but honestly I would try anything at this point, even more bad drug reactions if it meant that this was not the level of normal I would be settling with for the rest of my life. I just feel like as long as I'm not immediately going to kill myself, that seems to be good enough, which seems cruel and disappointing. As things are, I don't know how much longer I can survive like this. 

I cycle through these suicidal loops so often that when I come out, I know I didn't really want to die, I just wanted to know that there was a possibility of a way out.

I don't want to say the cliched line 'I'm sorry you're going through that' which seems to be the standard automated response to someone sharing their pain, because it never makes me feel any better.

We don't need to be going through the exact same thing but just being able to be honest about how terrible things are and meeting in the middle through our mutual suffering is enough. I don't want to minimise how unique your situation is, but I will say that I definitely share a sense that I'm living purely out of obligation to my family and also that it feels pretty much impossible for me to feel any positive emotions, enjoy anything or relax completely without self-judgment, fear or paranoia setting in.

1,"Ok main thing is distraction. I‚Äôll start on the work but because of ADD I‚Äôll have really short attention span esp if it‚Äôs something difficult to read or if I don‚Äôt understand it. So I‚Äôll take a break then I‚Äôll sometimes take a nap because I‚Äôll end up getting tired. So then I‚Äôll end up doing work late at night. And I‚Äôm not sure how to make myself focus. Because if I take breaks I‚Äôll end up making them too long. The other thing I have trouble with is keeping organized. I‚Äôll put stuff where they need to be, but when it goes in my backpack even tho Ik where it is it just gets crumpled up and I‚Äôm not sure why. But there are other times where it‚Äôs about 5-2 mins towards the end of class and I‚Äôll be rushing to pack my things away and I‚Äôll just drop it in my backpack and they also get crumpled up that way. So there‚Äôs the organization in my backpack and then I have trouble with time management. So part of the problem is the nap thing 8 mentioned earlier, and the other thing is I have a lot of trouble following through with things. For example I forget if I stated this on my original post or not but my counselor and I had come up with an entire plan. This is the counselor at my college. She gave me a sheet and it had each day of the week plus the weekend days. And she had me write down every bit of hw info I had plus any upcoming tests/quizzes/exams. So I wrote that down and we blocked out chunks of time to do for each class period. Like we said ‚Äúfrom this time to this time I would work on the hw from English‚Äù and so on. So we did that and that was that. But when I went home here‚Äôs what would happen the entire situation with the long naps would happen, and sometime si wouldn‚Äôt take naps but then if I had a test to study for as I said in my post I would take the time to type out my flash cards and because I‚Äôm a freshman in college I don‚Äôt really know how to study for tests and all of that for college. I didn‚Äôt realize it was different from hs. So I would spend hours sometimes all day and throughout the night typing stuff because there were so much info on the PowerPoint slides and each PowerPoint was about 25-40 sometimes up to 100 slides long and in each of those slides were lots of info so it was hard to pick and chose what to study which is why I spent so much time typing them out instead of studying. And that‚Äôs also partially why I got tired because of staring at the screen for so long and it was getting hard to concentrate cause of that and ofc as I mentioned earlier cause of my ADD. So basically my point is I‚Äôm not sure how to study for my tests so that I can manage that and also finishing my hw from my other classes so I can get it all done in time and still take breaks in between but not taking naps. Well not taking long naps anyways. So I hope this helps. I actually met to send this yesterday but I was pretty busy yesterday evening and all yesterday afternoon.

But she said until my parents and I decide what to do w/ that her and I could come up w/ a plan or some ideas at least and start going from there. And what‚Äôs the 2 min rule? I‚Äôve never heard of that. I‚Äôll take a look at the link you sent me. And I some what did that towards the end of last week. I downloaded this app called Things 3, and it‚Äôs a checklist type of app and I woke well w/ checklists so I thought it was a good idea. I mentioned this to my therapist as well and she told me as long as I keep up w/ it and I don‚Äôt get distracted by planning all sorts of things out, and just coming up w/ one simple checklist, then it should work. Hopefully that made sense lol. And you know, I did try the method you suggested of setting aside a certain time to do hw/study. Idk if I said this in my post or previous reply, it‚Äôs been a couple of days since I‚Äôve seen both, but, when I make a list of things that need to get done and that are priorities eps when it comes to school/college, I make the lists long, and detailed and then I end up getting things complicated which in the end makes me confused and not to mention the fact that I spend hours creating these detailed lists so therefore I never get anything done because I‚Äôm spending my time doing that. And you know I really don‚Äôt think I mean to procrastinate like this,cause my therapist said that‚Äôs a form of procrastination and I do believe that it is, but I don‚Äôt think I do this on purpose. I feel like I‚Äôm almost trying to cover myself up from getting stressed out on my work. This would happen in grade school constantly and this was extremely bad my senior year of hs. And it‚Äôs gotten much worse eps during my fall semester. And this summer I‚Äôm only taking one class, and I thought it was a class that I was going to be interested but I read the class wrong and I thought it was something else so now I‚Äôm less interested in it, but at the same time still slightly interested cause it is an art class and I love art, so anyways, w/ me being less interested it‚Äôs getting harder and harder to focus on doing and completing my work and because I was deciding back and forth whether I wanted to continue w/ this class or not, I got behind on my projects I was supposed to be completing and turning in. And these are pretty simple projects to and like I said considering the fact that it is an art class and I love art, it shouldn‚Äôt be too much of a struggle.

- There are evidence based and effective treatment options for people with BPD. Meaning, the way you‚Äôre feeling and living can be helped. You CAN live a healthier, more stable life. 

- There is a community of people who feel lmk ist like you. All those times you‚Äôve felt like you‚Äôre broken/unfixable/isolated/alien‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not. So many people out there have some of the exact same symptoms/triggers/coping mechanisms as you. You‚Äôre not alone, and these life experiences have been seen by others. We are not doomed.

For me, I caught myself mid-split and was able to stop the cycle I always find myself in. Then, it happened again, but this time I caught myself earlier on. And sure I know I‚Äôll still experience the pain of BPD, but having control over my reactions gives me a lot of hope that I will live on solid ground again (hope that makes sense). 

- Kind of a side note, but since learning that my BOD came from trauma, it‚Äôs been affirming that what I went through was actually not okay, and my reactions and feelings are valid. I‚Äôm bigger than that trauma. And since I lived through that hell, I know I can survive. With therapy (started 2 weeks ago, so I‚Äôm currently riding the high of hope) I can take that strength I was forced to gain and build from there. I really believe people with BPD are much more capable than they can give themselves credit for.",wazzledazzle,uldyu8

Okay either.",RJtheTrashPanda,uldyu8
