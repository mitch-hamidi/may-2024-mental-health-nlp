0,I wanted to share some coping mechanisms,"Hello. Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and these are just suggestions:
Mindfulness Meditation: Taking a few minutes to focus on your breath can help ground you in the present moment and reduce anxiety.
Journaling: Writing down your thoughts and emotions can provide a valuable outlet for self-expression and self-reflection.
Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Techniques: DBT skills, such as emotion regulation and distress tolerance, can be powerful tools for managing intense emotions.
Engage in a Hobby: Find activities you enjoy that allow you to express yourself creatively or provide a sense of accomplishment.
Reach Out for Support: Connect with friends, family, or support groups who understand or are willing to learn about BPD. Sharing your feelings can be therapeutic.
**Remember, it's okay to ask for help and to celebrate small victories. What are some strategies that work for you? Let's share our experiences and support each other in this journey. 💙",1706253473.0,False,11,1,Prestigious_Joke424,None,1abcnxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1abcnxc/i_wanted_to_share_some_coping_mechanisms/
1,i made this free card deck to help me manage my BPD,"hi y'all. i've used the DBT Skills card deck in the past, and found it really useful. I wanted to make something that brought together my favorite elements of DBT (emotion regulation and distress tolerance), plus what i've learned from buddhism.

so i made [this free, printable card deck that i'm calling the Mastery Deck.](https://bit.ly/3HjpwsM) 

it's a combination of Mood, Mindset, and Mantra shifts. 

* The Mood cards are mostly a combination of emotion regulation and distress tolerance tips from dialectical behavioral therapy.
* The Mindset cards are ways to shift your perspective and shore up your sense of self.  
* The Mantra cards are mainly quotes, including several from the wonderful Thich Nhat Hanh.

the deck is meant to be used in any way that serves you: by picking one card daily, or just when you need it, or by shuffling until something resonates.  

this is just V1, so i'd love feedback and for you to share if you like it. <3",1645924382.0,False,50,3,victorywulf,None,t2c8cj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/t2c8cj/i_made_this_free_card_deck_to_help_me_manage_my/
2,BPD w/ SUD,"1. I was diagnosed with BPD back in 2021 at the age of 32.
2. Tried to join a 52 week program on dialectical behavior therapy. The program was twice a week once for group & once for individual therapy. However, you had to be accepted into the program and at that time due to substance abuse, they felt the money spent (self pay) and active SUD I would not be a good candidate for their program. 
3. After that I found myself thinking well if I can’t even makes it into DBP then how the heck will their be any improvements. So fuck it! 
4. I have found been self isolating since given the news and not really put much into place with the expedition of medication management and meet with my psychiatrist once a month. 
5. I have not found self isolating to be such a bad thing till recently. Also, at the time mid Covid pandemic, and I submerged myself into continuing to grow my real estate brokerage. Business has been great! However, self love self care and therapy went to the back burner. In the meantime SUD has progressed. 
6. I am looking for a treatment center that has a detox and residential program that offers more of a deep dive into DBT but also allows for an hour or so each day before or after group to use my phone and computer. Dropping off the face of the earth when you are a small business owner is nearly impossible. Who is going to pay for the health insurance to stay in treatment? Often times the treatment is out of network or self pay so money needs to still come in. I have employees that are counting on me and their families. 
7. In my search for this type of facility it’s been very difficult some have been willing to accommodate but it’s going to be 4 in my search for this type of facility it’s been very difficult some have been willing to accommodate but it’s going to be $40,000 to $50,000 - others it’s an absolutely hard no - or they might offer the work accommodation but little or zero focus on DBT. 

Any suggestions on facilities to consider?

Thanks!",1704106415.0,False,4,1,SpeakmanRE,None,18vug3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/18vug3n/bpd_w_sud/
3,The ole breakup dance,"Soooo I’m here because my partner and I have broken up. He has commitment issues, depression, and anxiety. I just recently was diagnosed with bpd. We care about each other a lot but trigger each other OFTEN. Usually when he will mention some vague future plan and doesn’t include me in it then I’ll get a fear of abandonment and spiral out which then makes him recoil from my clinginess. OR there was a time when he DID try fully committing but then I was suspicious of him/didn’t believe him. We’ve been doing this dance for about 4 years now and have gone to couples therapy before I learned of my bpd symptoms. 

As a solution to all this he wants us to be broken up, for me to accept that, but for us to continue being intimate, and living together and working on our mental health but as “best friends”. I’ve run this past a close friend who doesn’t have BPD and is aware of the black/white thinking that goes with bpd and he reckons this is still waaaay too hard accept even without bpd. I suppose I just wanted some suggestions from all of y’all while I’m waiting to get into some dialectical behavior therapy— ant wisdom you can throw this way would be much appreciated.",1593003231.0,False,2,2,Creepazoid1,None,hf0i15,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/hf0i15/the_ole_breakup_dance/
4,Canadian mental health's week,"This week is Canadian mental health’s week.

I cannot remain silent. I have witnessed so many prejudices related to different mental illnesses. And I have been victim myself of some prejudices related to my mental illness.

I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and I have an eating disorder (ED). 

I am trying really hard to recover from my eating disorder. It has been a year since I am in therapy and take medication. Even though I am on the path of recovery, I am still sick. My day-to-day existence is still challenging. I have been victim of many misconceptions people have about my disease. Today, I want to break those misconceptions. 

First of all, I have gone to my family doctor before my eating disorder went out of control. I’ve told my doctor I was worried about the relationship I had with food. I’ve told her that every time I felt angry, sad or anxious about something, I ate. I’ve told her that I often got up at night to eat things I didn’t allow myself to eat at daytime. I’ve told her that I was sometimes craving for junk food. I’ve told her that I was often eating so much that I felt a pain in my stomach. I’ve also told her that I was constantly checking my weight because I was worried that I was weighing more than my friends. Those are the common symptoms of an eating disorder. My doctor didn’t take me seriously. She didn’t consider my eating behaviors as a problem. Actually, she told me it was quite common among teenagers to like junk food and to eat “too much”. 

For a couple of years, back in high school, my eating behaviors remain the same. I was stealing money from my mother’s purse to buy junk food. I was hiding food in places where my mother could not find it such as my room’s closet. I had drawers filled with wrappers. 

Then, it got worse. Two years ago, I had convinced myself that I had some kind of virus and that I couldn’t digest food anymore. For a week, I had stopped eating. My close ones were worried but they didn’t question my behavior because I had convinced them I had a virus. When I started to eat again, food disgusted me so much that I felt like I couldn’t keep it: I had to throw it all away. And that is what I started to do.  At first, I told my parents that I was throwing up because of the virus. But, it kept getting worse. I could barely eat with them. And when I did, I ate a ridiculously small amount of food. I was throwing up after each meal. And I had started to skip meals. In a matter of a few months, I had lost a lot a weight (something like 25 pounds). At one point, I couldn’t concentrate at school anymore. I was feeling weak. I was feeling anxious around others. At that time, all I wished for was to disappear completely. I told my parents I needed to go to therapy. I knew something was wrong but I didn’t know what it was. My first therapist diagnosed me with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), related to a sexual assault I had been victim of a couple of years before.  Then, I was diagnosed with Depression. Then, I was diagnosed with social anxiety. Then, they found out I had an eating disorder: I was diagnosed with bulimia nervosa. Finally, after a suicide attempt and a stay at the hospital, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). 

I have found it really difficult to hear about the final diagnosis because I knew that this one was accurate. When my therapist first described to me the symptoms of BPD, all I could think was: «It is me. It is all me. Is it all that I am? Am I a disease?» For those of you who don’t know much about BPD, there are nine specific symptoms to this illness but you only need to have five of them to be diagnosed with it. First of all, BPDs fear abandonment. That’s why BPDs make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. Because of that fear of abandonment, BPDs have unstable relationships. BPDs relationships are often intense and short-lived. Also, BPDs have unstable self-image. BPDs may feel good about themselves for a short period of time and then hate themselves. BPDs often don’t know their needs and desires. They may change values, goals, and even sexual identity. Because of their unclear self-image, BPDs engage in impulsive or self-destructive behaviors such as self-harm, risky sex, alcohol or drug abuse, binge eating. Those self-destructive behaviors can lead to suicidal behavior. BPDs also have intense emotional swings. They are described as hypersensitive. In fact, Marsha Linehan, the psychologist whom invented Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), which is now used to treat people with BPD, says: 
“People with BPD are like people with third degree burns over 90% of their bodies. Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement.” BPDs also experiences chronic feelings of emptiness due to their unstable self-image and their lack of self-confidence. BPDs can also struggle with intense anger and can have trouble controlling it. More frequently, BPDs direct their anger towards them. Finally, BPDs can experience episodes of paranoia where they feel suspicious about other’s motives and out of touch with reality.  That feeling can lead to out of body’s experiences. 

After I was diagnosed with BPD, I knew I had to tell my close ones. The impact of the symptoms on my life was so important: I could not pretend that they did not exist anymore. My therapist had warned me that the reactions to my diagnosis could be quite inadequate due to all the misconceptions people have about mental illnesses. Unfortunately, people often see BPD’s desperate calls for help as attention seeking. For example, that is often the way people feel about self-harm and suicidal behavior. Another common misconception is that people think that all BPD sufferers are extroverts. People think all BPDs express their intense emotions at the exact moment they feel them. In fact, some of us keep a lot of those emotions to ourselves. Sometimes, it is because we are not sure how to express those feelings. Sometimes, it is because we don’t even know how we feel: there are so many emotions trapped inside of us that ask to be released.  If you know someone suffering from BPD or from any other mental illness, you have to know there is no magic way to cure for those illnesses. The person who suffers from a mental illness has to be ready to recover and that feeling can only come from her. There is nothing you can do except stand by her side while she is trying her best to recover.  

I hope that my statement will help to demystify BPD and Bulimia Nervosa among some of you. And, I hope that those of you who suffer from any mental illness will feel less lonely. I also hope it will encourage you to speak up to stop the stigmatization of mental illnesses.
