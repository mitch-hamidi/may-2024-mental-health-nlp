It was absolutely hellish and beyond harmful for me, and I'm still dealing with that damage ~2yrs later. The first session was the emotional/mental equivalent of the coke and menthol (might be using the wrong word there) and I slept for around eight hours right after as soon as I finally stopped crying. I was deeply distraught but I was given the heads up regarding how difficult it can be so I just kept pushing myself through it because of my ""if it hurts it must be working"" mentality. It only went downhill from there and I consider myself very lucky that external forces made me unable to keep paying for that therapy. 
It's only now looking back that is very obvious to me that I was being re traumatized without any kind of healing.",Lunnaris,197nw11
1,honestly i never really saw much of a difference. i never experienced what others had explained they experienced during it. my mind would just wander and i’d be day dreaming honestly.,100260,197nw11
2,"I just started mine last week and have my second session this morning. I’ll admit, last week was a bit rough, in that I felt like my emotions were more erratic and I felt less composed than usual. I actually had a panic attack, which I haven’t had in years. But, I suppose that’s to be expected when addressing issues I’ve avoided for most of my life. 

I have gone from one session a week to two with my therapist. One for talk therapy and one for the actual EMDR. I can say that I didn’t start right away with EMDR. I’ve been seeing my therapist for about 10 months and we waited until we both thought I had the necessary tools to deal with. I’m utilizing journaling (pen/paper) more.
That’s just my experience, so far. I’m sure it will be challenging for me, but I don’t want to leave my issues unaddressed. 

I hope you get the information you’re looking for-feel free to pm me if you have any questions. I’ll answer as best I can, not that I’m an expert. Or pm me if you just want to say what a crock ‘O shit life is-we can vent",mymentalhell,197nw11
3,"EMDR is difficult initially because it forces you to relive trauma. If you break through it, you'll realise that it's the only way to recover from it.",BettySwollocks45,197nw11
4,"Same experience. Called the traumas into short term memory (also called remembering them), watched the therapist’s finger for a minute or so, then my mind went straight to, “Give me a break.”

Grimaced at the end, which the therapist interpreted as some breakthrough. “I can see you’re processing something. How do you feel?” “My eyes hurt.” “Anything else?” “€150 poorer.”

Cancelled the second session (with extreme prejudice). Hokum.",barney_muffinberg,197nw11

My goodness what I would give to be one of these oblivious assholes. But that’s not the cards we were dealt. 
I am 40. Just diagnosed I. Last year (but it’s been there forever). Push yourself to talk with mom. Push yourself to be with friends. Isolation is the worst thing u can do I promise u.
As far as therapist. If child work isn’t working. Say it.
See if they do t offer up something else. I’m sure u e heard it but the go to is DBT therapy. But for me the best was EMDR. 
See what happens if therapist won’t budge then u move on. It suuux. But we have to be our own advocates.
This shit is the hardest shit on earth. We both know that. Fight. Fight it.

0,"Find and join a DBT course nearby. There will be something and they usually meet weekly. Anything anyone tells you won't work unless you understand, think, analyse and respond. You can't now because your habits are set, you need to understand that what you do now is reinforced in some way and your emotional responses are too strong to overcome in a reasonable way - if it was easy you'd have changed by now.

Sorry to sound down, but honestly the sooner you reach out for help the sooner you can manage your emotions better.

BPD is real, but hiding behind or blaming BPD for your actions is not productive.",demunted,byq47h
1,"I didn't get better at finding non-destructive coping mechanisms until I did quite a bit of therapy, DBT work, and EMDR. That's not at all to be discouraging, you can make progress with DBT (IMHO) with workbooks from Amazon, etc if you're not yet in a position to go to therapy. My coping / distracting tools today can be as simple as listening to a playlist I made on Spotify of really loud music, to meditation, or even just sitting and breathing a bit. But none of that stuff worked great until I had done some work with DBT and EMDR.",BPD_BHM,byq47h

0,"There a lot you mention I feel the same way and relate when it comes to emotions. I’ve never really felt emotion. Everyday is a battle for me and majority of the day I have no emotion, but to pretend. It’s frustrating and exhausting at times. And I hate myself it seems more and more because of it. Like some curse.",JMaximus85,uucbmy
1,"It's really strange to realize you don't do or feel things in the ""normal"" way. No real advice here but hang in there.",oisin_berry,uucbmy
2,"Same to you bud, I hope one day you will have a control on it and will get easier to deal with. When the moments I do feel emotion, I’ll either be really happy or if something triggers me and I get upset, I get really upset quickly. There is never a middle.",JMaximus85,uucbmy

1,"BPD is a sadly stigmatized disorder, and it's disappointing that professional bias is a real thing.

If you're struggling with PTSD symptoms like flashbacks and dissociation, EMDR could be a highly effective treatment. One challenge in treating BPD for someone who has post trauma responses is ""staying present"" during treatment; trauma therapy like EMDR usually includes practicing skills specifically to help that.",TranZeitgeist,fu914t
2,"Usually for people with BPD the best course of action is to do DBT and get to a stable place and then do EDMR or other trauma work if its applicable (it sounds like it is). DBT is kinda like crisis management skills so you can tolerate the every day, and once you get that under control it's much easier to work on the less fun stuff. Doing any kind of work with trauma isn't something you want to start if you aren't at a stable place because it's a really difficult process and it can bring up old wounds and make you worse before it makes you better. You want to be able to cope with that before you bring it all up. 

I'm sorry that your therapists are being difficult. It's so frustrating how stigmatized BPD is unfortunatley. I don't know if your diagnosis is already officially on your file, if it's not, it may be prudent to delay mentioning BPD until a few sessions into treatment. Therapists without much  experience often have stereotyped images of a disaster client when they hear borderline. And honestly it may be best to look for a therapist without such views. As much as it sucks to be turned away by therapists, if someone thinks they wont be able to treat you properly, them not treating you is in your best interest.   

If you can, look for a therapist that does DBT because more than likely they will be willing and used to dealing with patients with BPD. A therapist with a trauma background is also ideal, and they usually go hand in hand.",,fu914t
3,I just learned what DBT is from someone else so I will be looking into it but because everyone is developing paranoia here in las vegas therapists are stretched thin,Alluringgaze,fu914t
4,Have you done emdr yourself how does it work also how have you managed BPD?,Alluringgaze,fu914t
5,Well I made a deal with my psychiatrist shes gonna hold off on letting anyone know that I have it because of the stigma with therapists. So I wrote this spam blasted to a bunch of therapists all over the internet as a fuck you. I'll post it up on r/BPD,Alluringgaze,fu914t

7,"EMDR is like a kind of exposure therapy. You might spend time practicing ways to lower intense stress and anxiety, like deep breathing exercises and physical skills. The focus is to work with someone in a safe space, with a goal of decreasing how distressing it is to be with whatever thoughts are in your head. The treatment helps to stay present and grounded, when sometimes trauma could make us disassociate and anxious.

I would recommend maybe visiting /r/CPTSD, for more discussion about EMDR.",TranZeitgeist,fu914t
