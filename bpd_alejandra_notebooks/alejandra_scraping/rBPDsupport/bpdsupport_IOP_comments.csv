1,"Thanks <3   
I know things can get better because its happened before, but it feels even worse because now I know things can get \*as\* bad again :'(",hurrahurricane,194xjvx
2,I know! It comes in phases for me. I’m currently in a Rocky relationship rn so my initial thoughts is to just destroy it. Been trying to do a daily routine where I feel more stable of myself; I can at-least control that. Message me if anything.,windontheporch,194xjvx
0,"Sorry to hear you’re struggling so much with such heavy things.

Forgive me but are you sure you’re right for each other? I agree he sounds like he needs therapy too, and to be actively working on himself as well. He also needs to take responsibility for his very real part in the issues with your relationship.

Again sorry to hear about your dad and how much you’re going though 🫂❤️",attimhsa,1ceon7f
0,"Hi! I'm new here too and also new to reddit in general. So I hope I'm not doing something wrong with this reply but I'd like to give advice as someone who was diagnosed around 2 years ago. (F20) 
 For starters, theres lots of stigma around this disorder. I've been through residential, iop, and php, (if you dont know these are inpatient/outpatient treatment centers, or what's considered ""rehab,"" where you live there and go to group everyday, possibly with Sundays off, for 3-6 hours a day. You stay in these facilities on average for 1 month) and even the professionals there can get nasty even upon hearing the diagnosis. (Ex. I was already diagnosed before entering, and each facility immediately refused my diagnosis, and then were disgusted after doing assessments/noticing symptoms and behaviors) With that being said, it's going to hurt while you're doing research and you come across people who make us out to be monsters. I still encourage you to do a lot of research. I would encourage most people to do some form of treatment. (I understand that money can be an issue I owe 7k to treatment centers even with my good insurance.) One thing I did when I was first diagnosed was I bought the DBT skills workbook. Professionals will say meds are only half the battle. For me, they are none of the battle because I was on 20+ different ones during treatment and I just don't currently feel like that's my way of going about it. Also important: Bpd CAN go in remission. I notice people acting like their bpd will be crisis level forever. It really doesn't have to be that way. I'm not completely better by any means, but I've for sure improved since I found out I had it. This is starting to get long so lmk if I can help anymore! (Don't know if there's a limit for this post or if I've broken any rules never use reddit)",bpdrelationshiphelp,1cxrx0s
0,"I have worked through the 12 steps!! In AA, although it can certainly be applicable with BPD too. I am professionally diagnosed. I live in texas sadly, although i would love to do virtual meetings. I have done PHP and IOP.  I would say my BPD is somewhat managed as well. Please message me if youre interested",,fwne8a
