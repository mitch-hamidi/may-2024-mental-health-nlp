0,Interesting interaction with medical professional - UK NHS,"
I was in seeing a mental health professional today. 

I've tried cbt several times and I've never ""completed"" it some of the times there were internal errors, some times I moved out of the area and sometimes I was the issue and found cbt so harmful to myself I had to stop for the good of my health. 

I have been asking for dbt for years now but because I'm ""not in an active crisis"" they won't refer me to it. I was seeking help yet again today and the medical professional likened the fact I haven't ""completed"" cbt to ""not completing a dose of antibiotics"" and that leaving the ""dose unfinished means it can never help, so we don't actually know if cbt doesn't help"" they said this was ""tough love"" and  referred me bakc to a psychologist which I'm grateful for, however I'm worried I'm just going to be given cbt again and not have my worries listened to.
Does anyone have any insight or similar experiences with this? I'm in the UK specifically going through NHS Scotland. 

I'm trying to get better so I don't fuck up yet another relationship after stumbling across the nicest and most understanding human. He doesn't deserve the bs bpd can bring and I've done my best healing and understanding my bpd on my own but I struggle still with abandonment. I've grown to create a good number of self-actualization techniques for most things just not this kind of dynamic and I'm scared ill destroy my relationship.",1689725509.0,False,2,0,Future-Temporary5036,None,153f2t3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/153f2t3/interesting_interaction_with_medical_professional/
1,new chapter new therapist sad to say goodbye,"I have my last therapy session next week.  The last 2 session I been crying . She wants me to update her once a week until I no longer feel the need to. I will miss her and it is not a goodbye , but ""  see you again"" . I am doing a DBT program for my bpd. I do not feel comfortable telling my family any of this. Last time I left the therapist and went backt to her my family was mad.  I also am def not telling them my diagnosis. Only a few people know and I am not close to them anymore. Cbt was not working for me. I know this is the best decision for me. It is 1 - 2 years program and it just scary and frusterating doing it alone. She is the best therapist and went above and beyond. I live at home too . anyways thanks for letting me vent",1714182190.0,False,1,0,Significant_Access_1,None,1ce2p82,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ce2p82/new_chapter_new_therapist_sad_to_say_goodbye/
2,should i go on meds?,"i was diagnosed with bpd a few years ago, i have mostly internal and quieter bpd. my therapist at the time said that there weren't many options of meds for people with bpd, so i mostly focused on dbt and cbt therapy. now, i'm feeling like my bd might be either creating or aiding some sort of depression. i feel very drained, angry, sad, a lot of the time. instead of experiencing euphoria and then episodes, i just feel like my brain is numb, sad and episodes. i smoke weed daily but it tends to make me feel brain dead, so i'd like to get back to smoking only a few times a week, but my feelings just become so unbearable sometimes. should i be looking into meds? considering the time, energy, and cost...",1699143254.0,False,4,11,fairyari,None,17nzkl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/17nzkl3/should_i_go_on_meds/
3,I need tips,"So I (25f) have been with my partner for the past two years. I was upfront and honest about my mental illnesses (Obviously BPD being one) from the beginning and about the fact that I had been in therapy most of my life. I've done a lot of work to try to get to a point to where I could somewhat control my emotions, ourbursts, as well as maintaining a job, my hygiene, friendships, etc.


Things changed when a few things happened that really hurt the trust in our relationship. I'd not been in love with someone for a few years before him, and when I fell, obviously I fell hard. I was extremely secure before it happened. So when this trust was broken, I began a course of losing control daily.


I began doing the things. Constantly asking if he still loved me. If he was cheating on me. If he fancied other women. I started getting so deeply obsessed with trying to find connections that may or may not have been there. Some of it is still hazy to me. I started taking care of myself less and less. Snapping at him and immediately registering any shift in his mood as his declaration of calling it quits for us. Granted some things I ended up being right about, but they maybe they really were not THAT big of issues?


Anyways, obviously this has put a huge strain on our relationship. I want to give him credit where it's due and say he has tried here and there to reassure me, especially when things initially went down, and somewhat tried to rebuild that trust. But finally admitted how hard it is to want to rebuild that trust, and give that reassurance, when I myself am constantly overthinking and constantly needing reassurance multiple times a day, for days at a time. 


This post isn't to complain about him, or get an opinion on whether or not either of us are treating the other fairly. We have had multiple conversations with great communication confirming we both want to make things work in the end, so I am also not wanting people to decide whether we should stay together or not. I will not speak for him, but I will say I truly want to do at least everything I can as my part in making it work as I know how frustrating and exhausting it is to live with this inside my own mind, and can't imagine how frustrating and exhausting it must be for a partner.


Anyway, my main goal in writing this is to ask if anyone at all has any advice to help snap me out of when I am ""splitting"". How to get back to reasoning with myself before reacting. How to think critically, rather than overthink every word or action. I've been able to overcome my lack of personal hygiene and have gotten back into taking care of myself physically. But after digging myself so far back into this hole, I am struggling with how to navigate getting back out and reclaiming my functionality when it comes to living with my own brain. Are there any books that don't make you feel worse?  TIA.",1705378052.0,False,3,2,WoahIssaMe,None,197tivn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/197tivn/i_need_tips/
4,I feel so invalid sometimes,"My symptoms just aren't as intense as they used to be & I manged that on my own. I followed bpd accounts that gave good advice & also have a boyfriend who I know where I stand with which helps a lot. I also know where I stand with my best friends & don't have many other friends to worry about so I'm not a huge wreck like I used to be.

But I feel invalid for it. I feel like I should've needed to go to hospital & DBT or CBT. Of course my symptoms still show a lot but not nearly as much as they used to. I feel like my struggle isn't real.",1595663167.0,False,3,2,doerayisme,None,hxiyik,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/hxiyik/i_feel_so_invalid_sometimes/
5,Just got home from the ER after a very close call and some severe depression. *TRIGGER WARNING*,"Plenty of trigger warnings ahead.



I had a flash back the other night from when I was raped (which is really hard to put that word down, it happened 3 years or so ago and I still can't say it out loud) and I've been extremely out of it since. Dissociating, severe mood swings, suicidal thoughts, the whole shebang. A good friend who's part of my wedding party sent me a big long, guilt filled make-me-feel-like-an-asshole message on Facebook because i had made plans when she wanted to work on goody bags that were her idea and we didn't want to do in the first place. 


Today I ended up cutting pretty badly and ended up in the ER for fear of overdosing. They discharged me and I've got to have someone watch me until my therapy appointment on Tuesday. I'm so out of it. The resident psychiatrist said there wouldn't be any point to admitting me since she believes I was suicidal from stress and just wanting to die because I wanted to escape. I was diagnosed about 3-4 weeks ago while I was in the psych ward for the first time. I need to start DBT but ugh. I just don't know what to do anymore. And I was in a partial hospitalization program for the last two and a half weeks learning CBT skills.",1439682884.0,False,5,4,PiffTheFairyMuffin,None,3h5dc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/3h5dc5/just_got_home_from_the_er_after_a_very_close_call/
6,Not sure how to navigate,"This is my first time posting in here, kinda nervous ngl. Sorry in advance that this is so long..

I (f28) met my person (f23) almost a year & a half ago. I’m diagnosed & unmedicated severe BPD for the past 6ish years. When we first met, we both communicated very well about how we were & what we feel our ups/downs are. About 6mos in, I started having symptoms of a BPD split bc of a situation in which I attempted to let her in on my grief (something I guard ferociously) & it wasn’t perceived. At that time, it seemed as if she didn’t care about me the way I’d been believing she did up until then. That initiated my split & to be completely honest, I cannot even begin to list or explain the things that I was feeling. I just was feeling as though she was completely against me & didn’t understand why she stayed around. I was drowning in the moment that caused the split & got stuck in that spiral. While she, on the other hand, was pushing & pushing for me to meet her needs in the present moments. (Theres things & moments that I’m leaving out for the sake of trying not to make this post way longer). In December (2 days before her birthday), I was told something that was along the lines of her cheating on me that dated back to the summer. This set me off even more & when I brought it to her attention, she seemed as though it wasn’t important enough to take upon herself to rectify. That made me feel like there’s some truth to the information, which I still haven’t been able to let go of. In January she moved out & back with her family in an attempt to put space so we can get better. In my opinion, it was working up until mid-Feb when she came to me about a personal medical situation that threw me for a loop especially seeing how we’d been intimate & I was being made aware of it just over a month after she moved. I was feeling very much so like just as we were going to be able to close the door on one thing, another door of bs opens up. I started feeling overwhelmed again & I didn’t feel like I had any support from her because she was worried about why I wasn’t giving her what she wanted/needed from me in the moment. I tried explaining that I was having a hard time processing everything (I process from the past to the present, not the present to the past so it’s basically like everything in the present is on pause while I go thru the past to identify different things). At the end of February/beginning of March, I reached out to an ex due to the fact that I’d noticed similarities between that relationship & this one that I wanted to correctly identify so I could change it in the present. That led to her & I spending about a week or so together with her spending the nights here. On the day that the ex was leaving, my person came in & saw her standing in my room while I was in bed freshly showered & had just taken my robe off to lay down (so it looked way worse than it was). That led to a long night of me explaining the BPD split, the reason I reached out to my ex in the first place, as well as the lies I’d told to keep it from being found out. I admitted it was super impulsive & I didn’t think at all before doing it, as well as not taking into account how it’d look or be perceived by anyone else. I told her it could be fixed & we could get better but it’d take a lot of work to do so simply bc I’m now in a space where I realize I let my BPD get way out of control. I was in my own shit storm for 8mos at that point & I have a lot of work to do to repair this relationship that’s been broken for about 5 of those 8. The next couple of weeks was kinda hard, there were some uncomfortable conversations but I did my best & explained as much as I could. I started changing my behavior as well. Last week there was a night she’d come over to spend time with me & asked to see the text messages between my ex & I, in which I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that due to the sensitivity of the conversations (they were majorly centered around my grief & my feelings/emotions during the first two years of it prior to the breakup). It’s not that I don’t want her to know now, I just feel like there’s steps that need to be taken before that due to the fact that up until this moment, the only time my grief has been brought up is during an argument about something else. She never asks me about it, and to me it doesn’t make sense to allow her into that part of myself without her ever even trying to talk about it with me. She’s now said to me that she started seeing someone, and is done trying to pressure me to open up to her. I’ve been doing CBT/DBT, as well as the BPD workbook by Dr. Fox all on my own to be able to get better for myself as well as the betterment of our relationship. I’m stuck feeling like I’m not being given a chance to actually open myself completely up to expose myself to the person that I want nothing less than forever with. I texted her this morning asking if we could talk in person because I need to be able to convey this to her. I’m just not sure how to go about it at all - what do I say or not say, what options there are to hold myself to, and more importantly if she can be the support I need to get us on the same page again so we can move forward. Does anyone have any suggestions on what things to touch on and what to leave alone? I really want us to seek couples therapy to bridge the gap that we’ve wedged.

7,So Stuck RN,"I have had periods of being very well emotionally regulated, mostly when I am modeling good behaviors/actions for others. What ultimately happens is I am so focused on others that I forget to tend to myself. I’ve had a few bottoms. One came during the plague with social isolation. I then got a WFH job and social engagements got super hard for me. Looking back I can almost see my self completely unwind. Stop going to gym, stop journaling, stop meditating, stopped taking showers, changing clothes, brushing teeth, then stopped taking my medications bc if I take the ADHD meds I feel locked inside my head and almost paralyzed on the outside. By this time my head had 8 different trains of thought on 6 tracks and at least one wants me to unsubscribe from life and they constantly whirl around up there. I asked for accommodations from my company and they then found a reason to fire me (Top sales rep, most customer compliments) and I tail spun. 

So I swore I would unsubscribe from life before giving up my 325ft studio apartment (bc it was mine and I paid for it all by myself) and move back in with my parents. Soooo…..my brother let me crash with him. My head was so dark and so mean to me that getting out of bed seemed impossible. Sublet the studio to someone who is trashing it and also wants to sleep with me. (Uggggg)

So now, I have done EMDR, ART, DBT, CBT and I’m therapy and have a psych and I’m still in this rut where I JUST DONT CARE ABOUT MYSELF AT ALL ANYMORE. It’s like the spark or fire went out. I can’t seem to find it. Brother was paying for top tier therapy and now it’s been downgraded to better help. He’s upset he’s not getting a return on investment bc I haven’t been able to be more regulated for the last 2 years. 

I’ve gained over 100lbs in 2 years thanks to gastroparesis from Weygovi/Ozempic/Rybelsus. 

I now have a bedroom that I operate out of and while my brother can be super encouraging and supportive, lately I only hear what I’m doing bad/wrong.

Now dad has had heart issues, step sis going thru divorce from a narcissist - she has two kids 4/9 and she’s a flight attendant with her own Truman’s manifesting in such dysfunction rn. (Which is effecting the kids)

I can show up for my dad and step sis and my niece and nephew and lately, I put the very disassociated mask on where I’m modeling good behaviors, showering, changing clothes, doing laundry, doing sisters dishes and laundry and going to doctor appointments. Did I make my psych appt this month…nope. Dad in hospital. 

When those duties/obligations end…..I deflate back into a dark hole who doesn’t really care if I see tomorrow. 

2018-2022 I racked up over 30k in debt, so there’s a bankruptcy that gets to happen, and I’ve asked multiple people to be my body double so I can sit down and get the information I need so I can file it. Currently, if I go back to work, one of my more aggressive lenders will get a judgement and garnish my wages. It’s so traumatizing for me that I did this to myself that I don’t feel safe doing it alone. 

I filed for disability bc it’s actually proving that me acting as the Geico duck in the boat plugging all the multiple holes (my family’s needs) is enough to be a full time job and I have adhd, ptsd, BPD, anxiety, agoraphobia, social anxiety. I don’t have clothes that fit. So I have mostly pajamas. I hate going in public and won’t do social things. And I’m so dysregulated rn that I couldn’t imagine working part or full time doing anything. 

I don’t know how or when we crossed that tipping line of full heartedly believing that my life is worthless. I don’t matter, I don’t want to be here, and have made certain promises to not do the thing I really want to do while parents are alive, or in family’s house. (This is one area where black and white thinking is helping me.) I care more about NOT inflicting trauma on my family than I care about myself.

I very much wish that I felt/believed/desired like I was capable of going back to giving a fuck, and taking my meds, and showering and looking forward to working out, wanting to be social, enjoying life rather than I have XYZ task that drains my batteries and takes all my spoons so now I need 4 days to recharge. It’s exhausting. 

I cannot seem to create and keep a routine bc nothing is routine. I’m pulled to take care of the kids or dad has new appts nearly every week. I’ve lost enjoyment and fulfillment in the things that used to make me happy like painting or singing. 

Everything hurts, every muscle aches. I don’t feel like stretching helps.

I find that I am seeing or aware of every flaw of my body and limitations since gaining all this weight. I could go on and on.

I’m getting frustrated at my limitations and when the frustration hits I’m not able to positively spin it to find a way to overcome it, the frustration is too loud and draining and before I can even acknowledge it and catch it to try to reframe it, my batteries are dead. 

I don’t know where to start or what to do first. I assume it’s one little thing to the next. I just don’t know how to do it when i genuinely don’t want to be here and don’t care. I am truly stuck. Like stuck stuck. 

Anyone with any experience with this apathy and stuckness, I’d really like some help from people who have been where i am and found a way to care again.

I live in the US and our mental health resources are limited and sorely underfunded and my family doesn’t have the resources to put me in a nice place for 90 days that would force me to have a routine. 

Short of inpatient, how to I get unstuck?",1696866984.0,False,2,0,Shaybuttah719,None,173vcg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/173vcg1/so_stuck_rn/
