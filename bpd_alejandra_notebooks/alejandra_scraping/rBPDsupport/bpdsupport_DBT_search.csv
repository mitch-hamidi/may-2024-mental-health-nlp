0,DBT STARTS TOMORROW,"Hello - if the title didn’t give it away, my DBT therapy starts tomorrow and quite frankly, I am absolutely terrified. 

I’m starting with my individual sessions for a few weeks and then I’ll be doing individual (with my thankfully very good psychologist) as well as a group session week. 

I have so many worries and so much anxiety it’s been disrupting my thoughts for weeks and not knowing anyone who’s been though it personally, if anyone can offer and advise on what to expect or share their experience with overcoming the anxiety it would be much appreciated.",1705354980.0,False,7,4,Ghostieeefizz,None,197kvsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/197kvsx/dbt_starts_tomorrow/
1,I can’t afford DBT and I don’t know what to do.,"Hi all,

Hope you’re doing as well as you can today. Remember your best IS good enough.

Long rant to begin with?

I got diagnosed with BPD in November 2023. I was lucky and able to access three months of outpatient treatment through the public hospital. (In Australia for context).

I am middle aged. I have the BPD trait of impulse spending. I wised up to building “wealth” and had a small bit of savings after working on saving for 18 months. I have never owned property, always rented and now my minimum wage doesn’t cover rent (and I’m gracefully living with my elderly / ill father. I don’t know how long he’s got.)

I quit my job (3 weeks before BPD diagnosis) because of my abusive boss and his horrible daughter. They both made my life hell, I was working 12-14 hour days. He threatened all employees (not just me) but the threat of “we’re going to put you in a PIP and terminate you” was too much to bear. I am the extreme of sensitive and cry at the drop of a hat. It’s crap. It had some savings behind me, however, I was unemployed for months and they soon disappeared.

I was bullied as a kid for being poor. I was bullied in high school for being socially awkward / different / gay. I’ve never had a lot of “true” friends, and without my dad, i don’t really have someone to reach out to.

I used to be conventionally attractive and rather healthy in my teens. When I finished high school, I lost my first serious relationship where my BPD symptoms were all over the place. My fault 100%. I sometimes go back and write to apologise to them, but choose not to. It brings up too much.

In university I made many friends and for a good 10 or so years we connected, they were accepting of my quirks, life was ok.

Then COVID happened.

(We know how that panned out. Still panning out.)

I also lost friends because of different life paths and how that stuff goes. No one did any wrong, we just drifted apart.

Then when things got back to some sort of “normal”; I joined a queer affirming church (religion does play a part in my heart, however, I do not condone abuse, murder, exclusion, and extortion in the name of Religion.)

I’ve made some friends there. They all live rather far away and I haven’t been to church since my diagnosis.

I also got a new job in March and I am enjoying it. There are a few downsides, yet only one that irks me.

There is a woman I work with. She is approximately 10 years younger than me. She is one of those “sickly sweet types” (100% me issue, not her issue. I know this.)

So far she has stated:
- Her fiancé has bought her a 170,000 car
- She controls all finances and her fiancés money is put into her account. 
- She had her braces, current car, and all overseas travel paid for by her brother.
- She is about to marry a man who is about to inherit millions of dollars.

She’s definitely a bit of a BS artist; I think we all can be, as life is tough. However, ever since her arrival my BPD has flared up. I am poor. Always have been, always will be if I don’t change my life.

As DBT costs 21,000 AUD + and is often ran during the day (when I’m at work); I cannot access it. 

My executive disfunction is rife too.

I am not close to my siblings as they are generations older and have their own lives. My extended family isn’t close either; my mum was an only child and dad avoided his family due to trauma. I don’t have many friends and I can guarantee I am sh*t at being a friend.

I am so lonely, facing tough times because Australia is only for the rich; and I can’t move countries to try something different. I only work in admin and I suck at crafts (but enjoy them). I enjoy reading too.

If you’ve made it this far, you’re amazing! Thank you for reading my ranting.

My question is: where do I start? I’m terrified of everything and spend every day suffering from s******l idealisation multiple times a day.

6,dbt therapist,"i am overwhelmed with the process of finding a DBT therapist and group during this pandemic, in addition to the usual stressors like affordability.

i just got off the phone with a very skilled, licensed psychologist (was excited about her background, liked what i read about her)

well.

she made the entire call feel really invalidating. sure, i could have done better but it was just your basic beginning phone call, asking about her process and financial structure. does she expect to be talking to well adapted people all the time? this wasn't a job interview, I didn't realize how much I was going to be judged... I was a bit slow to answer questions and was unsure of some things, and she talked over me and had this very holier than thou attitude... eventually steering me away from her therapy.

i feel like such an idiot right now, and I have about 6 more DBT therapists/clinics to call.

I don't want to pursue anymore, I want to just stop right here but I'm so miserable I know I need to keep going but god, this part is challenging, especially when you're at such a low point.

the last thing i wanted this morning was to be invalidated by a therapist. i get enough of that from myself and my overly critical work environment.

14,Need someone to talk to,"I've finally come to terms with my borderline personality disorder, along with other personality disorders that overlap with my borderline (npd, hpd, aspd). And because of that, I'm dealing with severe cognitive dissonance right now from having to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder. I just feel so disconnected from people most of the time. If they don't give me that intensity, or if they don't give me the admiration, attention, and affection l crave, I devalue them. This makes romantic relationships very very painful and unsuccessful. I often dream of material things such as fame, fortune, and success, because I feel as unless I achieve those things in life, nobody will ever love me, because that's how my parents raised me. 

""Mama said: fulfill the prophecy. Be something great: go make a legacy. Manifest destiny, back in the days, we wanted everythingzzz we wanted everything. Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated. All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting""
-Panic! At the Disco.

Because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic or sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would prefer to date a girl. I just can't. The attachment feels too intense and I feel too codependent, and it's just too strong of a feeling for me to handle. 

 I am ashamed of the fact that I'm so freaking selfish, and that I have this idea of a perfect partner in my head and it's all almost as if I just want somebody who is willing to just drop everything and be at my aid it's almost as if I just want somebody to serve me. It's very narcissistic and then when they don't give me the attention that I feel as if I deserve, and when I feel abandoned, I act out against them. I just want someone to unconditionally love me. But unconditional love does not exist. It is just a concept. Everybody wants something. Even the spiritual people who claim they unconditionally love people. They're doing it for themselves. They're doing it for that spiritual high for that connection with a higher power. I never experienced true parental love growing up, ny parents were narciissists too. So I don't believe in it. I almost want a partner to chase me and prove to me that this kind of love exists. I want them to be obsessed with me the way that I obsess over the object of my affection--The ""FP"" that I am idealizing at the moment. That is my definition of love, and its flawed.

I have tried DBT, and it actually makes me worse. I hate how DBT is oversold to people with BPD ---almost everybody that I have spoken to who had BPD who tried it said that it did not work for them. It's just a marketing gimic. 

I want to get better, but I feel hopeless and scared.  I know that I probably need to find a provider who specializes in cluster B. But even though it seems as if those people only seem to interpret us through what they read in books, and there's a lot of misinformation out there on cluster B's 

I also need to work with a therapist who could handle BPD and NPD and ASPD. Usually when I tell a therapist, I've been diagnosed with those things, they run. It's like ""oh, your borderline have you tried DBT?""

""Oh, wait, you're also a narcissist and sociopath? Well, then you're incurable. I'm sorry, but I can't help you at least if you were just a borderline you could try DBT""

 I feel as DBT works for some borderline because they're just borderline. I feel as if it's probably my NPD that makes me not react well to DBT.. People with MPD cannot handle that level of introspection. It literally makes my head explode. 

They don't recommend DBT for NPD. For NPD, you really just need serious talk therapy. Think about it narcissist get talking about themselves it's the most therapeutic thing, the world for somebody with NPD lol.

Either way, I just really need someone to talk to you because I feel very distressed tonight and I've been in a serious BPD episode for the past few weeks and I'm just now coming out of it!! despite by resistance to DBT I still am open to treatment and may even be open to going to a DBT group however, I just don't really know if I would be in a skills based group I feel as if I would be better off in some kind of therapy group, where you could just talk about your feelings and develop support.",1706439534.0,False,6,3,Actual_Pepper8815,None,1ad08fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ad08fd/need_someone_to_talk_to/

I was doing yoga with my mom recently and really practicing mindfulness. As the instructor spoke, she talked about setting our intentions for the day, as well as being aware of our breathing and what we were doing. I found it really helpful to take my mind away from my emotional, disordered thinking and just really focus on the moment: observing my body, describing how the poses made my muscles feel, and trying to be non-judgmental about staring at myself in the mirror for an hour straight :/ It was a challenge, but it was really effective!

2. Tried to join a 52 week program on dialectical behavior therapy. The program was twice a week once for group & once for individual therapy. However, you had to be accepted into the program and at that time due to substance abuse, they felt the money spent (self pay) and active SUD I would not be a good candidate for their program. 
3. After that I found myself thinking well if I can’t even makes it into DBP then how the heck will their be any improvements. So fuck it! 
4. I have found been self isolating since given the news and not really put much into place with the expedition of medication management and meet with my psychiatrist once a month. 
5. I have not found self isolating to be such a bad thing till recently. Also, at the time mid Covid pandemic, and I submerged myself into continuing to grow my real estate brokerage. Business has been great! However, self love self care and therapy went to the back burner. In the meantime SUD has progressed. 
6. I am looking for a treatment center that has a detox and residential program that offers more of a deep dive into DBT but also allows for an hour or so each day before or after group to use my phone and computer. Dropping off the face of the earth when you are a small business owner is nearly impossible. Who is going to pay for the health insurance to stay in treatment?

31,I never wanted to be me.,"I’m 30M and my girlfriend is going to leave me. I’ve tried so hard to be better. I’ve even been doing the mindfulness techniques and DBT exercises and yet today. All she wanted to do was talk about her feelings and I got defensive.

I grew up watching my dad do exactly this and I promised myself I wouldn’t do it. And here I am 30 and on the verge of if not already lost the love of my life because I couldn’t change. I’ve tried so damn hard.

I just want to be normal. As a child I said I’d be a good dad, good partner and not like my dad. And I couldn’t even do that.

I thought I could save us. I thought I could be more but I can’t. I don’t know when but someday I’m going to walk out of that door and no one will see me again. Everyone will hope I’m out there somewhere. My parents will never have to know what really happened to me.

32,I’m new here,"My most recent psych doctor suggested I have BPD, and it honestly lines up with my symptoms. I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around it. I’ve always had the extreme mood changes, and the thing where if someone does something “against” me, I will think of them like an enemy, if that makes sense. I had pretty significant trauma in my childhood and I’ve heard that’s common for this diagnosis. I’m also in recovery from alcoholism and an eating disorder. One good thing about it, is that I switched to DBT in therapy which I like, and have tried new meds like a mood stabilizer in addition to an SSRI, which never worked alone. I’m not as suicidal, like I was for awhile. So there’s progress. I just, I have this overlaying feeling that to my core, I am damaged/broken/unworthy. Like there is something wrong with me. It gets worse when I have to interact with other people, and I feel so awkward and overthink everything. But when I don’t interact with other people, I isolate and the obsessive thoughts of unworthiness gets worse. I’m ranting, I know.

35,Thoughts while traveling ,"I am really looking forward to getting back home, spending some time with friends. 

Have you ever realized how exhausting it is to try and keep up with your favorite person. It’s like imagine if we gave all that love ourselves. I’m working on some DBT today and journaling. You ever think a lot of your relationships were cool because we were the fuel . Like the firey love we give was what kept everything going even though the others didn’t reciprocate in the same manner. 

I spoke with the nicest guy in a coffee shop today and just had the best conversation and it really solidifies that there are genuine and kind people in this world. I have been shutting everyone I know out and experiences with people who possibly truly can care about me as a person or help me a good support and it’s like you turn to yourself and say for what. Why am I setting myself on fire to keep this flame lit for people who are not conducive to long term happiness. 

Super excited for what is to come. It does get better. The right one will love you and not keep you in predator / prey mode. Cheating is not normal and you are good enough for the right person. The right person will want to talk to you, will want to do the things and will just all around be like nothing you have ever experienced before. 

Invest in those that invest in you. Give the time to those that want to be with you. Invest in true experiences.  

I promise you there’s more to life than that little boy who always made you cry 😘

36,i made this free card deck to help me manage my BPD,"hi y'all. i've used the DBT Skills card deck in the past, and found it really useful. I wanted to make something that brought together my favorite elements of DBT (emotion regulation and distress tolerance), plus what i've learned from buddhism.

so i made [this free, printable card deck that i'm calling the Mastery Deck.](https://bit.ly/3HjpwsM) 

it's a combination of Mood, Mindset, and Mantra shifts. 

* The Mood cards are mostly a combination of emotion regulation and distress tolerance tips from dialectical behavioral therapy.
* The Mindset cards are ways to shift your perspective and shore up your sense of self.  
* The Mantra cards are mainly quotes, including several from the wonderful Thich Nhat Hanh.

the deck is meant to be used in any way that serves you: by picking one card daily, or just when you need it, or by shuffling until something resonates.  

this is just V1, so i'd love feedback and for you to share if you like it. <3",1645924382.0,False,48,3,victorywulf,None,t2c8cj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/t2c8cj/i_made_this_free_card_deck_to_help_me_manage_my/

39,Recovering BPD,"
I’m new to this group, but I’m not sure if you all feel similarly. For me BPD takes form in many things but mostly separates into two versions of me: the Rational version and irrational version.

Rational me: wonderful person who is accountable, kind and caring.

Irrational me: impulsive to a fault, and doesn’t realize he’s speaking in mostly black and white thinking, mixed with suicidal, abusive and manipulative actions.

It feels like alone, I’m not as much as a burden but when I’m dating someone seriously for example my current partner of two years. I’ve managed to cause so much trauma to her.

I hate myself almost everyday. Why? I’ve essentially been exactly like how my father was to my mother despite having promised the younger me I’d never. While, I know it’s not my fault I didn’t learn the right coping mechanisms if at all any. I can’t help but feel like it’s me doing it so it’s my fault. I can be great for days and weeks but then an incident brings me back to square one. I always feel like I’m having to push the rock right back up the hill again for it to never reach the top.

Has anyone here had similar behaviours and how did you deal with consistent need for validation out of fear of abandonment. For example, I ask my partner if she’s loves me a ton less now because she’s almost on the verge of leaving and she can’t really tell me it because it’s drastically decreased.

It feels lonesome, I don’t know anyone with BPD and I wish I at least knew one who successfully treated their symptoms to give me hope.

Years of therapy and this year finally found a DBT therapist. Seen him a handful of times but still seems like I’m not fully getting better. I am trying to use my skills more frequently though.

40,advice on how to manage expectations/splitting in therapy,"Hey everyone,

I am looking for help with how to lower my expectations of my therapist and articulate what I need from him after feeling like my therapy has become stagnant. I have once previously voiced how I feel therapy isn't going anywhere asking him to be more directive and strict with me. I've realised I am withholding how I really feel from him or withhold being honest about what's going on for me as worried to be vulnerable but then I build up resentment towards him for not knowing what's going on or being able to help. This is a pattern in all my relationships and causes them to be really turbulent and painful. I am frequently told ""I can't mind read"" or ""nothing is ever good enough for you"" from ex's or family which I know is invalidating but I can see truth in what they say. All of this causes me to get very confused and not know what the truth is.

I have been working with a my therapist for 6 months after moving DBT clinics. It is really frustrating as I now dont do DBT the traditional way of group, coaching and individual all at the same place and instead see my individual therapist privately outside the clinic I do DBT in due to changes in the system. He is the 3rd DBT therapist I have worked with an I have been persistent trying to ride out my feelings of therapy being futile and work out if I am splitting on him. From a logical/rational perspective I understand he knows his stuff having worked as a DBT therapist for over 10 years and has done a mindfulness retreat with Marsha Linehan and frequently goes to trainings overseas. I found him after meeting a girl in a psych admission who said her BPD was in remission due to him and I take anything people say as gospel and immediately left my therapist to try and see him. I don't understand why I idolise people I haven't even met and then when they dont meet those expectations try and look elsewhere. I suppose I want to move to the next stage or address bigger picture stuff but he is hesitant to look at the past/family as it is not really inline with DBT which is focusing on the present and change. I want to get clear on where my therapy is going as I do'nt struggle with problem behaviours daily like I used to however I am frequently having melt downs, blowing up friendships, can't move on from failed toxic relationships or manage any perfjoamcne related stress/be employed.

This is my first post in reddit and am looking to become more involved with the BPD support community so any help in how to do so (commenting, with subs etc) would be appreciated.

She is straight, with a fiancé, and 2 kids…. Well they’re not engaged, but they are about to buy a house together. They have a whole life together, she talks about how much her man has improved her life. How he takes care of the kids and everything. 

Even if I was a man I know I wouldn’t be able to do HALF the things he do 😩😩😩.

But anyway, I visited her page like 20 times today. I saved several of her pictures.

43,How to tell between splitting/senseless anger vs anger that makes total sense?,"Idk if I'm wording this right, English isn't my first language so bear with me.

So for context, me and my partner are both diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder, so we have a hard time admitting our faults when we fight, or just being patient with each other. We both have abusive traits in the relationship and I'm not proud of that.

But I got ZERO mental health knowledge, so I don't really know how to tell when I'm wrong for screaming, contradicting, ignoring, being angry at my partner and when I'm right for doing so (as in: he did something that will spite an angry response in ANYONE). 

Yesterday, his sister brought us some chinese fried rice since its my favorite food with some fries. We're Costarrican, so this isn't everyday food btw, this shits special.
As it was cold, and my boyfriend didn't show any interest in it since it ""looked weird"", I started cleaning HIS familys house, doing some leftover dishes, wiping the tables, cleaning the floors a little... so I could peacefully sit and eat the fried rice. I mean, I'm getting a little treat from his sister, might as well treat her by cleaning their house.
I was finishing everything up, I even air fried the fries separately so they wouldnt taste like microwave... and surprise, my boyfriend is now besides me, looking at the food with hungry eyes...... I thought to myself: ""Nah, he wouldn't eat the fries, he just ate a bunch of food..."". I washed a last dish and I turn and boom, one fry left on the plate. I caught him red handed.
I would've broken up with him for this. Like, dissapeared forever, for a bunch of fries... 

I was so angry, I wanted to scream, I felt a pressure in my chest, my eyes were crying before i even processed whatever happened... I wanted to die over some fries. And this happens all. the. time. over a thousand other things... 
I ended up angry for an hour or two until I stopped being mad and I asked him to say sorry to me because he clearly saw how much it hurt me... but its such a stupid thing, why am I even treating someone poorly over these stupid reasons???? What can I do?? How do I tell when I should be mad or when not to be mad, especially when I'm angry with my partner over past things that genuinely matter and hurt me? Even if i supposedly forgave him, I still bring those thoughts forth when we fight!!

46,how do i have a normal relationship?,"So sorry this is a bit long but if anyone can give me any advice I'd appreciate it!
For some context - I have BPD and my boyfriend does not. He has some other mental health struggles but they infrequently cause any tension or issues in our relationship and none are personality disorders.
I started dating my boyfriend about 8 months ago and this is the healthiest/most stable partner I've ever had. 
In all of my previous relationships, conflict was always resolved in unhealthy ways like screaming or ghosting, and the relationships tended to be very intense and short-lived. Unfortunately, a lot of those behaviors and tendencies are still hardwired in me.
In this relationship, almost all the issues we have are caused or worsened by me escalating things out of instinct/habit.
I tend to get insecure about his feelings towards me, usually triggered by small things like a shift in tone or a perceived lack of interest, and I vaguely ask for constant reassurance (things like “Do you still want to be with me, do you still love me” etc). When his answer isn't perceived as “good enough” to me I lash out and accuse him of not caring about or loving me.
I’ve gotten him to the point where he feels like nothing he can say is good enough for me and as a result, he’s stopped putting as much effort into his reassurance, unintentionally worsening the situation.
I don’t know how to stop needing so much reassurance, or lashing out when I don’t get it. Asking as frequently as I do is coming off as accusatory and the last thing I want to do is lead him to believe he’s doing something wrong when I ask to be reassured, it’s nothing he’s done it's just my own thought process freaking me out. 
I’m currently in DBT therapy but it’s an incredibly slow process and I’m worried that he won’t be able to put up with the way I act for much longer. He’s always relatively calm, patient, and forgiving with me but I pull the same thing over and over and I feel like I'm pushing him farther away each time when all I want is to make sure we’re still close.",1713339248.0,False,3,1,Weird-Pepper8335,None,1c63vle,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1c63vle/how_do_i_have_a_normal_relationship/

49,How to identify how I feel towards someone,"Context: went through a mutual/circumstantial break up of a healthy relationship in January. Moved back to my home state two weeks after. 

I immediately met someone I was fascinated by and from day one struggled to identify how I felt about them and if it was romantic/sexual at all. Met once more and was obsessed and had a crush for the first time in years. Next time we caught up we stayed together and hooked up but I was slightly uncomfortable because I didn’t verbalise physical boundaries properly. Went home obsessed with them. 

I had no reason to text them and spent days thinking of an excuse, but they take 3-7 business days to respond if at all and so waiting for communication left me feeling all types of ways and incredibly dysregulated. 

We saw each other again when I went to the city for first aid training and stayed at their house. I just can’t figure out what I think about them. 

On one hand I’m obsessed and totally fascinated by their way of being, and I ended up enjoying the sex and closeness this time. But I also can’t even decide if I think they’re attractive. I resent how anxious they make me as my need for routine and plans doesn’t fit with their go with the flow nature and I sort of hate them for their poetic arrogance. It might not be arrogance idk. I’m a rigid and practically thinking healthcare worker and they’re a psychotic artist seemingly living off mummy’s money. I don’t know what I want or what I am getting out of this relationship?

I went through my DBT handouts to try to name my emotions and as far as I can tell -
I feel happy about much of the interactions we have.
I feel disgust or contempt about something.
I feel anxious because of the lack of consistency I get from them both in person and with the fact they don’t value texting.
I feel angry. An always thing.
I feel some form of limerence.
And I feel guilt for not understanding how I feel about any of this.

Someone who would always stay a friend at the end of the day no matter what. I thought our bond was so strong and special that it would never break. Tonight it did. The woman he swore I would never need to worry about? His ex wife he swore he would never even call a friend. Tonight he is in a hotel with her and their children at the beach and the deed has most likely already been done. I have been diagnosed bpd and have NEVER trusted someone so much. We have been broken up now since December but lately it’s seemed just too easy for him and last night it was confirmed why. I thought I was going to grow old with this man. My children asked to call him dad. I loved him children so immensely. He swore and swore he would never entertain her in any way and here I am spending all day and night non stop puking from panic attack after panic attack and crying since 5am yesterday. I have children but I can’t function. I also have ocd and I usually go to cutting when I feel this much pain inside of me but I’m been working so hard to quit. Tonight broke me apart. I have zero will or want to live other than my children now. I pictured them holding each other in their hotel room all day and night. And when the sun went down I lost it. I lost all of what I had left to love of myself inside of me. I have his poetry tattood on my shoulder where he used to kiss me when we made love. I had never felt safe and loved during sex before him. All night tonight knowing they were in a hotel together I pictured them making love over and over and so detailed I swore I could hear it. I lost my mind and blew him up so much begging for him to please make it stop for me, that he told me a restraining order has been set in stone. He’s made me begging and voicing my complete betrayal and hurt of him ending up in her arms and having sex with her of all people, just me being utterly insane and unsafe. He’s turned into someone who acts like he never even loved me once. Was never my best fucking friend. Was never so in love with me we could take the world on and feel so good. You guys I feel like since I could not take my life tonight as I so wish I could have, it hurt that much, that I lost all ounce of self worth, dignity, hope, love for myself and just all sense of wanting to carry on for good. I swear I felt the pain get so intense tonight that I felt myself leave my damn body. I’ve never cried this much in my life. I’ve never hurt so much in my whole god damn  much. The amount of betrayal if you guys even knew… it’s all too much overwhelming and all consuming. I was literally screaming out in pain for god to please make the pain stop. That is so anything. He said I need help tonight and he’s right. He hasn’t once acknowledged or even cared about how much this has broken me apart. The only thing he’s done has been to make me feel even shttiwr than myself. I can’t do this. I have zero coping skills and apparently now I’m not a safe person and there’s a restraining order placed against me by someone I swore would be there for me ni matter what. I don’t know where to go from here, I can’t contemplate this is really happening to me and I just have this overwhelming want to rip this tattoo straight off my skin. I know I’m insane. I know I’m worth putting a restraining order on because I’ll blow someone up with texts when I’m hurting. I know I’m completely unlovable but to do this to me? To break me to this point of no return and only make it worse for me? How?! How can he just be ok with doing this to me?! Help me to cope with this please SOMEONE PLEASE HEAR THIS PAIN.

52,Behaviour I can’t figure out,"I do this thing to my partner where I try to tell them what they are or what they should be thinking. I’ll tell them I treat them great, they should be grateful etc and anyone would be lucky to be with me but then I will somehow counteract it then with something I say.
My partner will say it’s almost like transference, I’ll say various insensitive things, it’s not like i’m shouting or being mean but i’m totally unaware that i’m doing it in the moment. 
My partner will try to explain what i’m doing but struggles and gets confused in the moment.
I’ll make excuses for the behaviour like “it was just banter I didn’t think it would upset you” 

I’m really trying to figure out why I do it and identify what i’m doing/what it could be but i’m struggling with it. I feel a huge intense amount of guilt for it and it’s very scary not even being aware of this behaviour when i’m doing it. 
I’m thinking maybe it’s some weird way of me coping, creating my own reality etc.
During these moments I’ll feel like i’m the one that’s been done wrong not the other way around or that I haven’t done anything wrong so it can be very confusing for me. 
My partner says I do it more/when i’m not doing so good mentally and she’s the only person I do it to. Neither of us can figure it out.

53,Im OVER having been cursed with BPD **RANT**,"Seriously Im over having being cursed with BPD...  
Im sick and tired of feeling every emotion at 2000% and especially during a BPD episode feeling so powerful & bulletproof, yet being terrified of myself but not having any sort of control or awareness of this till i reach my ""emotional comedown"" and then have to feel the shame, regret and self hatred over what i said or did  only for the other person who unfortunately was either the trigger or just was in wrong place and time to feel so damn hurt in my words and actions they want nothing to do with me going forward :-(   
  
Im starting to understand the 1 in 10 statistic of us suffers choosing to unalive ourselves - because eventually hurting those closest to us, eventually chips away at the last fragment of our very soul. I am lucky that my greatest fear is death, so personally im safe from that easy route out because if i could i would at this point - my last episode made me lash out hard against my best friend to the point they arent speaking to me currently - whether thats for good - who knows at this point.  
  
And yes before anyone asks - im currently in DBT and are up to the part where both opposites of things arent always left or right but rather they can exist at the same time. Still doesnt help me to regulate my emotions to one where it doesn't leave an extinction level event behind.... im very tempted to skip right to emotional regulation.   
  
Not only did i have to survive Childhood cancer, and dealing with the father figure who raised me that was more than likely the cause of me developing this curse, i also have to live with the consequences of said curse and the loneliness that comes with me personally having BPD.  
Because there is no way in hell im allowing anyone to get into any sort of relationship with me with any slight chance i could split on them and turn the sheer magnitude of my curse toward them - its not fair!

54,Just got diagnosed.,"Hey guys. (Sorry for confusion I’m new here:))
I (24F) am in DBT outpatient treatment. Just finished 3 weeks of the PHP program. And now on IOP. Which is just 3 days a week for 3 hours a day. The PHP program was 9am-3pm Monday through Friday which I felt like I had a purpose and I was doing something. 
Anyways I guess what I need to let you all know is I was diagnosed with GAD and MDD when I was 16-17 after that went down a slippery slope of drugs (literally all of them) until I did acid at 20... and  thought I lost my freaking MIND lol (funny because having bpd you feel that way anyways) 
I always knew I was “off” or something. 
Fast forward 2 and a half years I was sober and fine.. so I thought. 
Here came the panic attacks, depression. Angry outbursts, quitting jobs, threatening to hurt myself. 
I knew I needed help or I was gonna go right back down the same bad road.
I found an (ACT) therapist that I’ve been seeing every Monday give or take for almost 2 years.. I think . I’ve also held down a job for a little over a year. At this job I had a breakdown that sent me to the doctors and that’s how I made it to the treatment center. I said all this to say now I’ve been diagnosed with BPD. .. idk what to do with that. 
Idk who that is but that’s not me. 
I have a loving boyfriend that doesn’t deserve to deal with all these emotions.

57,Interesting interaction with medical professional - UK NHS,"
I was in seeing a mental health professional today. 

I've tried cbt several times and I've never ""completed"" it some of the times there were internal errors, some times I moved out of the area and sometimes I was the issue and found cbt so harmful to myself I had to stop for the good of my health. 

I have been asking for dbt for years now but because I'm ""not in an active crisis"" they won't refer me to it. I was seeking help yet again today and the medical professional likened the fact I haven't ""completed"" cbt to ""not completing a dose of antibiotics"" and that leaving the ""dose unfinished means it can never help, so we don't actually know if cbt doesn't help"" they said this was ""tough love"" and  referred me bakc to a psychologist which I'm grateful for, however I'm worried I'm just going to be given cbt again and not have my worries listened to.
Does anyone have any insight or similar experiences with this? I'm in the UK specifically going through NHS Scotland. 

I'm trying to get better so I don't fuck up yet another relationship after stumbling across the nicest and most understanding human.

60,How common is BPD misdiagnosed? Asking because I was diagnosed a few years back and do not think it was correct,"Hello everyone, 

I am not sure how common my story is, but I think it's more common than I would think.

I was a problem child for a lot of my childhood in school, but began to improve in middle school. I was very bad with people all my life and everyone who meets me ends up disliking me (this is not an exaggeration, this is unfortunately quite literally the case). This caused me to be a very homebound child and I grew very, very attached to my family. I was academically rather successful in HS, but socially the same. College was an unmitigated disaster for me and at the urging of someone I ""saw someone"". The last time I was evaluated was for autism and ADHD in elementary school and was given a clean bill of health, so to speak.

After two days of talking to someone, the psychiatrist said she believed I had BPD. I heard of the condition before, but I was taken aback and after several sessions asked if she stood by her assessment and she said yes. After our sessions ended (I saw her in secret), that was kind of it.

I began reading about BPD more and more and the more I read, the less I saw myself in the condition. Yes, I have huge issues with impulse control and have pretty dire self inflicted issues with my health. I am very clingy to people because of the fact everyone I have ever known has run away from me. I have a limited sense of self, to a certain extent, and have huge problems being alone without anyone with me. 

But otherwise, it just doesnt click all that much. I am not suicidal, I am not driven to make rash sudden decisions that screw up my life, I am not the kind of person who would quit a job just because I want to curse out my boss (I am pretty good at holding my tongue when there is something in it for me). I wouldn't say I have emotional dysregulation. 

This happened a few years ago, and I havent followed up on it, but the problems in my life havent gone away. 

I figure that I have to wrestle with whether or not I was misdiagnosed to make progress on that front. Is it a thing to be misdiagnosed? Is this a condition like ADHD, where it's over applied? I am a guy, if it makes any difference.

61,Hyper fixed on BPD and panicking if I have it ):,"I’ve struggled with mental health my whole life. Depression, and anxiety and self esteem issues. I’ve also always been a sensitive person. I grew up with an emotionally absent dad, who neglected me with basic affection and love aside from providing for me physically, and an emotionally unstable mother who would rarely get physical and throw things, get angry and triggered easily. My parents caught CONSTANTLY. That is all I know. Anyways, I tend to Google things, especially lately because I’ve really been struggling with my mental health the past 4 years. I’ve heard of BPD (borderline personality disorder). I know the symptoms / traits, and so as you can imagined while googling, and watching videos, I notice that I line up with a lot. I’m emotional, I can get triggered easily, when I am in a relationship, I always need reassurance, and am scared they’ll ending leave me, etc. but doesn’t everyone not want their partner leaving them? I can definitely be emotional - like I said, I’ve always been sensitive, am hard on myself, am insecure and scared of judgment, anxious all of the time, struggle with handling a lot of stressors, I have self esteem issues, and I overthink like NON OTHER in general. Im just always in my head is how I can describe it. Im VERY self aware at least. Anyways - the fact that I see traits lining up, scares the absolute SHIT out of me. If I have it, I feel like I will end up being alone for the rest of my life, and be so doomed because people with BPD struggle in marriages / relationships, I’m so scared if I have kids, it would be passed down to them, and I would have negative effects on them, what if I’m not taken seriously, people are scared of me, I turn into my mother, etc etc. what if what if what if is just running through my mind. Nothing really changes about me. I know what I want in my life. I know who I am, what I like, my goals and who is am deep down. So I don’t have identify issues that people with BPD I guess? I can’t stop thinking about if I have it. I heard it’s a terrible thing to have. I heard about DBT, but what if I don’t respond well to it?? What if I suffer for the rest of my life. I know traits over lap with eachother. But idk. So far, I feel like I have it. I have a therapist I just started seeing, and I’m going to bring it up. I’m just so scared. I’m so scared of judgment.

I have experienced really intense emotions since childhood and have been in and out of therapy for years. BPD has been on my radar for years and at the back of my mind I fit the criteria, but I’ve recently been looking into it more and I feel certain I have BPD. 

I’ve recently been through a breakup and have been having intense depressive episodes and really intense angry outbursts. I say awful things to people I love, I tell them I wish they were dead and other horrible things.

A bit more context because the title might be making me sound insane (maybe I am): 

Me and my gf have been dating for some time and it's safe to say l've never felt this happy with anyone else before. But I have my issues and sometimes silly stuff tends to bother me, so I'm wondering if this is one of those: My girlfriend is pansexual. I'm not really the jealous type, but there's this one girl, let's call her Kelly, that just rubs me the wrong way, the thing that calms me is that this girl isn't single either. My gf posts pictures of her close friends all the time and l've never batted an eye before, but just now she posted a random mirror selfie of just Kelly (This is the 2nd or 3rd time she has posted Kelly, they've known each other for 4 months) and wrote 'my girl' over it. The reason this upset me a bit more than it should have is also because she hasn't properly talked to me all day either, then suddenly said she has to sleep and the second we say goodnight she posts this. ...? Should I feel concerned or is this just a normal thing friends do? Should I bring up that it feels sort of weird to me? It's hard to decide because then I would most likely have to say that it's specifically pictures of Kelly that seem strange to me, and I would also have to mention that there's just something I don't like about that girl.",1707863641.0,False,7,2,New_Strawberry_729,None,1aq6opc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1aq6opc/my_20m_gf_19f_is_posting_pics_of_people_on_her/

I am at a loss, there is no hope for me, I get better then I just crash.
Sick of my life, everything was going so great, I was connecting with family, socialising, practicing my DBT skills. Then boom, the paranoia, the sudden reaction of abandonment, trust issues then the rage.
Every skill I have been practicing just vanishes.

I have insulted, yelled and accused my FP of some crappy stuff.

I don't know if it's the Bpd or them, I can't trust anyone, angry with everyone.
Suicidal and I don't want to carry on with therapy, I have nothing, no friends, job or a social life, I am so lost I can't even get into a platonic relationship never mind having a GF.

My life has gone nowhere, I have no kids neighborhood keeps a wide birth of me.

I am just an unpredictable mess.

My thoughts and actions have cost me a lot, now I just don't want to be here at all.

I don't want to kill myself but I don't want help or to live either. I just want to stagnate and rot away. I haven't taken suicide out the equation, I just want to punish and hurt myself as much as possible first. 

I have tried over and over to make a better life for myself and I have nearly succeeded with great friends, money, vacations, but I just ruin it.

Is this some pitty story, not really it's more for myself. I hate living, the moods the inappropriate behaviour, the getting better and failing.
My cousin who was more of a brother killed himself, and I just want to go too.
I just need to build the courage to do so.

In the meantime all I can do is destroy my life, I don't deserve anything good.

I am going to give it a short while before I have made my decision. I have never liked my life.
Abuse after abuse, I should hurt the people that abused and destroyed my life before I go, I want to see them have that look in their eyes that they gave me, that realisation there is nowhere to go or do but put up with the pain. They are going first.

68,Struggling to Relate,"Reading some of the posts here I can’t help but feel a bit like the odd man out. I’ve been formally diagnosed with BPD and managed to come to terms and acknowledge that yes, I might have a spooky scary personality disorder, but reading through this subreddit and what other people who share my diagnosis generally say I’m even starting to question the psychologist who diagnosed me. 

I wouldn’t describe myself as a jealous or possessive person, hell I could probably count the times I’ve felt like that in a romantic context on one hand, which is also why I’m poly (by choice, and very happy with that). 
I still get intensely obsessed with new, shiny people and enter a stage of what I’d describe as lovestruck mania. That usually lasts for a few weeks before I either loose interest completely or calm down a little, but can be reignited as it happened with my current fp. 
In most relationships I’ve been the more distanced one though exactly how I feel about someone can fluctuate heavily, but so far I’ve always done the breaking up in the end (usually because I lost interest in someone or they did too many tiny but wrong things). I think I’m also fairly good at managing the whole fear of abandonment thing or rationalizing my feelings and restraining myself when a small comment makes me want to cry or scream. 
Of course I got plenty of other issues and while I wouldn’t say I’m good at relationships I’m generally reflected enough to force my feelings to conform to what I deem appropriate and minimize the harm for both people. Its a ton of work manually managing and weighing the rationality of every impulse and emotion though.

I guess my question is more a plea for validation because it would suck to go through the whole spiel of getting diagnosed again, but also if that genuinely sounds like another issue I’d like to at least know what people who do have bpd think of it. Maybe for added context I should mention that I’m a 20 year old trans guy (not on T yet though), and while I definitely did grow up with somewhat unstable attachments I’m really close with both my parents now and I know they tried their best (which I know isn’t the case for everyone, not trying to imply that).

73,Partially recovered. Trying to figure out what's next is screwing me up.,"Quick summary. Mid 30s, female. Diagnosed BPD a little under 2 years ago. Long history of, well, everything you'd expect. Went to DBT, learned a lot, got a lot better, but still struggling. 

Several months ago, I had a ""final meeting"" with my therapist where we agreed that I needed time to process what I'd learned so far. 

I think it might be time for me to go back, but I'm not sure. I'm hoping maybe I can get some feedback to help me figure that out, and figure out whether I should see the same therapist or try a new one. 

My therapist was amazing. She explained things to me in a way that I could really understand. She validated my emotions consistently and taught me how to do the same for myself. She has been certified in DBT for many years, and she specializes in BPD.

I feel like I was emotionally a 6 year old child when I started to see her, and she helped me grow considerably. 

Now I feel like it's time for me to learn to stop coddling myself quite so much and become a fully functional adult. 

Problem is, ever since I altered my expectations of myself in that way, I've noticed my symptoms resurfacing. 

I don't *want* to be an emotional child forever. I *want* to move more toward normalcy, but I'm absolutely not willing to undo everything I've done so far.

75,I really really need some help.,"I'm hurting so fucking bad right now. This is my worst nightmare for my BPD and all of me. 

I'm shaking writing this out of pure anxiety and panic so sorry for horrible wording of things. I feel nauseous and dizzy.also paraphrasing coz its complicated with unnecessary details. 

Few days ago I was excited to show my friends something and they responded with a few vague words and it really crushed me and made me feel uncared for. I was sad at the time and was expressing my feelings to another public group about it (not mentioning her, just about my excitedness being annoying to people.)

Yesterday she was upset and hurt when she found out what I said because to her it felt like I was making a targeted attack behind her back. She said I could've just mentioned how she made me feel. 

I didn't want to do that because they always get upset when I ask stuff like ""are you mad at me?"" And ""do you hate me?"" All the time. I didn't know how to win in that scenario. 

I told her that and also that I obviously never meant to upset her and I was never mad, just sad and needed to vent. I was never calling her out or anything. 

She never responded. Its been a day and yea, I have kind of freaked out begging them to respond and just tell me if they are mad at me. I've been sick all day just on my phone waiting for them to respond. 

I didn't fucking mean to make anyone upset but my feelings again ended up hurting someone and now its my fault for causing pain again. And I have to apologise and beg for forgiveness. Again.

But I'm also hurting so bad from this too and I know if I say that they'll say I'm manipulating things and making myself be the victim. But no,im just suffering and in pain and I can't control that

At this point I dont want friends, im so tired of this happening. How do I just... drop friends without them saying im aj asshole. I just can't keep fucking up and hurting people

But her job is slowly migrating back to the office and that means she won't be with her phone during that time. It's apparently just for a week before going back to working from home. I'm not sure how it works; her country / job is really weird and harsh. 

But for context: when she's asleep, or we don't talk much I feel myself slipping. I feel empty. All I can do is wait for her to talk to. It's been like this for over a year. I've completely gone dependent on it and I know that. I don't remember how to be alone with just myself anymore. I get anxious, I get more depressed, I feel guilty for feeling clingy. I'm also not in therapy right now cause my therapist retired and the only one they had to offer me was a middle aged man... and I have trauma with men, so I couldn't do it.

85,VENT // 2023 is Crazy and I'm trying to be strong,"TW: ED

So this year it was awful. I moved, got my car broken into the second day. A day before my birthday I got into a horrible car accident (wrecked both cars). Someone new entered my life. My new coworker ""C"". She is a bit of a emotional and mental burden, I can especially say that now.  That said C and I get along well, but inside I am writhing in pain and fear. Working with her is a bit mentally draining, she is a diva and also can be overwhelming during our shared shift. Not much of a team worker. She is an explosive manipulative (maybe victim complex/ narcissistic) character, and just recently she got my hours cut at work (too much detail to type, but am in the process of figuring out how to get my work hours back and communicate to my boss about this). 

 Throughout all of this I have tried very hard to stay calm and move accordingly. DBT helped a lot through all this. Never would I have thought as an adult I can have moments where I'm proud of myself. Definitely a long complicated dark journey. 

However through all this, my ED came back. I'm trying to be self aware on how to cope with this. Yes I'm going through alot, but also I feel a large feel that I am dissociating most of the time. Days feel like a blur, if its not ED, I found myself drinking and smoking. Like its always something self sabotaging. Ik this is common with BPD. And I'm working to try to slow that cycle to try to put my own needs first.

I also recently got into a situation ship which is slowly moving into a relationship. There is a lot of nervousness about it, I am trying to navigate as well. I can feel the stages of Obsessive neediness, Withdrawing and withholding, and Escalating devaluation coming in. I don't know how to navigate that and its scary. I have never been successful with it as well. I'm also scared he became my FP with all of this shit going on. I want someone to just tell me what to do tbh, but ik thats also really hard. 

I want to explode and ruin/end all my surrounding relationships. I am also financially struggling and going to even more with the shit ""C"" pulled. I know a mental spiral is coming. I don't want it to. Any advice or guidance?

My problem of hyper-fixating on my partner seems to ebb and flow. Sometimes, I feel balanced and our relationship feels healthy.

Right now, the fixation problem has become pretty severe again. These past few days, I continually find myself distressed thinking about my relationship. I worry that I'm being annoying or that my partner doesn't care for me anymore. These worries usually lead to spiking fears that my partner is going to leave me.

I plan to reach out to resume counseling ASAP. I've been working on a DBT skills workbook, in the meantime. I'm wondering, has anyone found any helpful techniques for managing these kinds of thoughts? Are there any distraction methods that are particularly effective for you?

And I feel too over it to care. He gives me my meds, I want to take them at this dose, he agrees whatever. 


But a legitimate psychologist (my therapist) who I find to be very sane, thoughtful, caring, and intelligent has recently diagnosed me with Borderline. I brought this to my psychiatrist of 10ish years and was met with the standard, ""you dont have that, those patients are very hard to deal with, you're very easy to deal with, you dont want that."" I think it's relevant that I'm relatively quiet, with high social anxiety, avoidant, and a  high-functioning variant of Borderline, meaning I can hold a steady full-time office job and a relationship of a couple years. But it's the first in my life longer than 3 months where he isn't abusive. And it really only started being functional after I restarted medications, which I've quit cold turkey several times in my life during depressive episodes.

Ok, first of all, as if I chose to have this disorder. Second, does having BPD necessitate breaking down in front of the psychiatrist and telling him to fucking hurt himself or something?? Does it necessitate a history of alcoholism or inpatient or cutting?  Has he spent more than ten minutes with me in a session in this whole year? Did he give any thought to the diagnosis other than to say ""well, I don't want to deal with another one, so I'm going to deny that's even possible and hope things stay the same""

Like wtf man is it because you think I have a dumb female therapist, Mr. Christian Republican know-it-all? She is a licensed psychologist who has been practicing for decades and has also treated borderlines before. Ofc, he didn't care to find that out, just hurried me out of his virtual office. Fucking making bank off being lazy and careless with patients like me. 

So idk if it's even a conflicting diagnosis, because he seemed not to even look into it or even want to acknowledge it. But my therapist has diagnosed me and we started going through DBT. 

I want to know if any of you have dealt with having your reality questioned by doctors, and how common it really is to be misdiagnosed with BPD, maybe if you really had something else going on. 

I've only heard that it's common to be misdiagnosed with bipolar, but in my case my mood swings are very clearly shorter and attributed to triggering events, I'm def not bipolar. My past diagnoses are complex PTSD, GAD, panic disorder with OCD features, and some mild depressive episodes. 

Anyway, what are your experiences with misdiagnoses?

98,emotional invalidation,"Does anyone else really get stuck on the idea of masking emotion? For so many years hearing to just be myself be natural and feel my feelings....I get so angry that no, in order to get by in life I have to lie about how I feel. 
My negative thinking and anger, self pity and such are becoming a real problem in every aspect of my life. 
To me the core of BPD is feeling emotionally invalidated but the. To survive we have to suppress and deny our emotions...my autistic logical brain hates this. I want to let out my feelings but they only bring punishment ostracization and so on. They get in the way of doing anything because I just haaaave to do what I feel like doing or stop trying to take action on unwanted tasks to avoid meltdown. Im tired of having to participate in roommate life, society, work, everything bc it takes such conscious control of my impulses and feelings at all times. Im worn out trying to be normal and can't tell when to take self care advice or when its time to compromise. I wish being honest, spontaneous and natural was actually okay the way They say it should be. To be honest that feels like lifelong gaslighting - just be you and it will all work out! Maybe for some folks. 

I feel like a permanent toddler, like I should just be able to do what I want, but I'm constantly in trouble, melting down and being judged for it. 

Is this something DBT works on? Or some kind if trauma healing therapy? 

Therapy sometimes just feels like more gaslighting. did EMDR once and it RUINED my life for years after. I even drew my therapist a comic of the different parts of me in boxes and her erasing the lines, the little tantrum throwing kid got out and the whole comic fell apart. She still pushed ahead and sure enough, I lost control and did some horribly embarrassing public meltdown that landed me in jail.

99,Desperate- please read at least the first part,"TL;DR: I figured start with this part and if you want more you can keep reading. Need direction to BPD specialists who can assist me in finding a residential treatment center or at least ideas anyone has on reputable places. Only foreseeable options are treatment or death and I'm losing hope. Please help me if you can. Just a quick message even with a name of a therapist you know, no obligation to a deep conversation or need to caretake if that would be a concern of yours. 

Ok, so here's the thing... I'm 32, divorced with 5 kids. I've dealt with issues since serious trauma at 13, and have recently uncovered issues before that even. I've spent over a year in residential and inpatient treatment for eating disorders over the last decade and they have been temporary fixes. As issues have progressively gotten worse and gradually expanded to the point that my coping mechanisms, anxiety, and depression have all aided in my inability to handle life, let alone be a functioning member of society. I've alienated myself from most people because either I get hurt or hurt them. I'm terrified of what my BPD and other issues will do to my children but equally what my killing myself would do to them but I have absolutely no desire to torture myself with this life anymore. I am willing to give a facility a playbook of every way I can and have cheated the system and myself to 'keep myself safe', in effect either numbing or putting up walls. This will be stupidly hard and likely shatter me so I need to be sure I have the best possible place for me. 

All that being said, I'm no expert and there isn't exactly a guide out there to treatment places and who is best and worst and what kind of people they are most likely to be able to help. After hours of research online I can only conclude that every place will obviously talk themselves up and they all look mostly the same. I cannot do this on my own but if I can find someone who specializes in the field, they may be able to tell me which ones have at least shown the most promise or fit best with what I need. I'm from a town where anyone who says they 'specialize' in BPD also specializes in depression, grief, adolescents, etc. Hopefully, you see what I'm trying to say. To have someone who actually knows the personality disorder treatment community would be a priceless asset and who better to ask than those suffering themselves and who outwardly are working on things and speaking about their issues.

102,villain era,"Anyone else had success just saying ""fuck it"" and embracing being kind of a shit person? 
I don't mean tolerating abuse or  hurting people and justifying it, etc, but just recognizing where a lot of these undesirable BPD traits come from and easing the slack on yourself. Like maybe I am kind of intense, volatile, needy, unmotivated and childish, and a bit of a deadbeat. Maybe I am boring and high demand.... but I'd rather be a minor villain and be alive than unalive out of shame at who I am right now.

I genuinely don't know if this is helpful or not but after being called all these things for so long and melting down at how hurt I was by those words, I've developed a thicker skin. 

Like why would being dramatic and difficult mean I don't deserve to be alive? Maybe I am those things, I can still put up with myself and take care of my basic needs. 

I think for me a huge part of my emotional volatility anyways was the pressure to be a perfect person or meet people's expectations that I literally could not. Or letting their words get to me on such a deep level. 
It feels pretty powerful to hear someone call me a loser and a narcissist and just be like ""okay whatever you want to see me as"" and not defend myself anymore bc what is the point? Ive tried to explain or mask that I am better and more capable than I am and that seems more hurtful in the long run. 

Not everyone understands what people with this kind of illness go through. 
Do I wish I was an upstanding, disciplined, calm and rational leader type with emotions of steel and a strong sense of identity so I could dedicate myself to a noble career? 

Yeah, some days. I loathe being This. But why? 
Because I decided early on only those Very Good People deserve to exist or be loved. 

But the more attached I've been to that idealized image of who I am not, the more judgmental I've been of others too and the more I project my own insecurities outward. 

I haven't done DBT yet but wonder if this is part of the process, like recognizing and accepting flaws, insecurities, and limitations and integrating them into your identity instead of rejecting them so as to be more tolerant of both self and others. 
Its just making sense to me as accepting being a villain. Sort of how many LGBTQ people (myself included) have reclaimed Disney villain queerness or slurs.

103,"Need relationship advice, trying to have a healthy relationship but also dealing with BPD symptoms. Can you ever trust your intuition?","A little background on me: I'm a 28 year old female diagnosed BPD about a year ago. Not currently on any medication or undergoing any therapy (cost prohibitive unfortunately) but I am trying to be more aware of my symptoms and deal with them using DBT skills. 

My past romantic relationships have been very tumultuous. I have a lot of issues with self esteem so I tend to hold onto relationships for a lot longer than I should and tolerate a lot of things that I shouldn't (e.g. lack of commitment after long periods, cheating) because I'm trying to avoid being abandoned/prove my self worth. Splitting is also a huge issue for me and I can be very impulsive.

I recently met someone through a dating app and we have been seeing each other for a little over 2 months. We regularly go on dates, he texts me every day, and we talk on the phone frequently. He speaks favorably of our time together, is affectionate in actions and in communication, and we talk regularly about future plans. 

In typical BPD fashion, I got attached very quick but am now constantly looking for a sign that he's going to reject me. I again experience splitting, although I only share these thoughts with the few friends who know about my diagnosis (in other words, I've never lashed out at this person for any perceived slights).

If these things were the end of the story I would just continue to practice DBT skills and try not to react emotionally. However, I decided to do some investigating and he is still on updating/using the dating app where we met. I know that to someone without BPD issues, it was be silly to assume he would have deleted the app only 2 months after meeting me, especially after us having never had a conversation about exclusively dating. However, it's very triggering for me and makes me feel betrayed and rejected. I obsess over it and it causes me a lot of anxiety.

What I'm wanting to know is how to best handle this situation. Do I bring up the idea of exclusively dating? Do I  try to let the relationship play out organically and do my best to control my behaviors like I do in other aspects of my life?",1461308331.0,False,7,2,bpdanon88,None,4fxclm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/4fxclm/need_relationship_advice_trying_to_have_a_healthy/

In the past before DBT and medication  (about 2 years ago) I was a very hyper sexual person. I would hook up constantly, and would behave in manipulative ways to have my partners stay with me because I hated being alone. I feel as though my actions in the past were not as consensual as I thought they were, and it makes me want to disappear any time I think about it. To clarify, I have never forced myself onto someone or ignored someone saying “no”, but I know that I have behaved sexually manipulative in the past and acted based on what I assumed my partners wanted instead of asking them. I hate this about myself. I realize that this behaviour was inexcusable and I have not been able to be intimate with anyone in over a year, because I feel so much shame and guilt for how I have behaved and want to avoid sex altogether.

119,Not sure how to navigate,"This is my first time posting in here, kinda nervous ngl. Sorry in advance that this is so long..

I (f28) met my person (f23) almost a year & a half ago. I’m diagnosed & unmedicated severe BPD for the past 6ish years. When we first met, we both communicated very well about how we were & what we feel our ups/downs are. About 6mos in, I started having symptoms of a BPD split bc of a situation in which I attempted to let her in on my grief (something I guard ferociously) & it wasn’t perceived. At that time, it seemed as if she didn’t care about me the way I’d been believing she did up until then. That initiated my split & to be completely honest, I cannot even begin to list or explain the things that I was feeling. I just was feeling as though she was completely against me & didn’t understand why she stayed around. I was drowning in the moment that caused the split & got stuck in that spiral. While she, on the other hand, was pushing & pushing for me to meet her needs in the present moments. (Theres things & moments that I’m leaving out for the sake of trying not to make this post way longer). In December (2 days before her birthday), I was told something that was along the lines of her cheating on me that dated back to the summer. This set me off even more & when I brought it to her attention, she seemed as though it wasn’t important enough to take upon herself to rectify. That made me feel like there’s some truth to the information, which I still haven’t been able to let go of. In January she moved out & back with her family in an attempt to put space so we can get better. In my opinion, it was working up until mid-Feb when she came to me about a personal medical situation that threw me for a loop especially seeing how we’d been intimate & I was being made aware of it just over a month after she moved. I was feeling very much so like just as we were going to be able to close the door on one thing, another door of bs opens up. I started feeling overwhelmed again & I didn’t feel like I had any support from her because she was worried about why I wasn’t giving her what she wanted/needed from me in the moment. I tried explaining that I was having a hard time processing everything (I process from the past to the present, not the present to the past so it’s basically like everything in the present is on pause while I go thru the past to identify different things). At the end of February/beginning of March, I reached out to an ex due to the fact that I’d noticed similarities between that relationship & this one that I wanted to correctly identify so I could change it in the present. That led to her & I spending about a week or so together with her spending the nights here. On the day that the ex was leaving, my person came in & saw her standing in my room while I was in bed freshly showered & had just taken my robe off to lay down (so it looked way worse than it was). That led to a long night of me explaining the BPD split, the reason I reached out to my ex in the first place, as well as the lies I’d told to keep it from being found out. I admitted it was super impulsive & I didn’t think at all before doing it, as well as not taking into account how it’d look or be perceived by anyone else. I told her it could be fixed & we could get better but it’d take a lot of work to do so simply bc I’m now in a space where I realize I let my BPD get way out of control. I was in my own shit storm for 8mos at that point & I have a lot of work to do to repair this relationship that’s been broken for about 5 of those 8. The next couple of weeks was kinda hard, there were some uncomfortable conversations but I did my best & explained as much as I could. I started changing my behavior as well. Last week there was a night she’d come over to spend time with me & asked to see the text messages between my ex & I, in which I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that due to the sensitivity of the conversations (they were majorly centered around my grief & my feelings/emotions during the first two years of it prior to the breakup). It’s not that I don’t want her to know now, I just feel like there’s steps that need to be taken before that due to the fact that up until this moment, the only time my grief has been brought up is during an argument about something else. She never asks me about it, and to me it doesn’t make sense to allow her into that part of myself without her ever even trying to talk about it with me. She’s now said to me that she started seeing someone, and is done trying to pressure me to open up to her. I’ve been doing CBT/DBT, as well as the BPD workbook by Dr. Fox all on my own to be able to get better for myself as well as the betterment of our relationship. I’m stuck feeling like I’m not being given a chance to actually open myself completely up to expose myself to the person that I want nothing less than forever with. I texted her this morning asking if we could talk in person because I need to be able to convey this to her. I’m just not sure how to go about it at all - what do I say or not say, what options there are to hold myself to, and more importantly if she can be the support I need to get us on the same page again so we can move forward. Does anyone have any suggestions on what things to touch on and what to leave alone? I really want us to seek couples therapy to bridge the gap that we’ve wedged.

121,Any tips to relax insecurities and overthinking?,"Hello! 

I’m having some issues lately in my relationship (obviously lol) and it’s got to the point where I really need to start helping myself because I cannot put much more on him without him exploding. He doesn’t deserve the constant screaming and then apologising over and over, and I really don’t want to lose such a special relationship. I’m going to do the healthy things, booked an appointment with a new therapist, have started running, made myself some routines and decided to make plans to see and talk with friends more (I live alone so as you can imagine the impending doom of abandonment is increased somewhat).

However I really need some tips on how to not overthink everything to do with my boyfriends feelings towards me. It’s like a cycle, I will read into something minor, like for example a word said in a slightly different tone, or a pause before answering a question I have, and I will think about it until I reach the conclusion that it’s because he’s falling out of love with me/wants to leave me/hates me etc etc. I then get scared and angry and have a meltdown or episode whatever you’d rather call it, which then leads to the enforcing of the fear that my mental illness will push him away. Even when we make up and I apologise and he says it’s okay, I  feel like he’s keeping it from me that he wants to leave. I know this is extremely paranoid/crazy behaviour but we all have BPD don’t we so I’m guessing people will understand? I just can’t believe that he loves me/wants me/fancies me.. no faith in myself in the slightest.

Anyway if anyone has any useful tips for not overthinking these things, trusting that your partner loves you and trusting that you are enough, that would be great! :)",1592231108.0,False,11,7,jmoondra,None,h9hcrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/h9hcrm/any_tips_to_relax_insecurities_and_overthinking/
122,Feeling stuck in my relationship,"I (32F) and my bf (31M) have been together for almost 2 years, but we don't live together. I'm turning 33 next week, and he'll be 32 next month. We both went into this relationship saying that our goals were to get married and have kids within a few years. He specifically said he'd like to start working on starting a family within 3 years. It's now been almost 2, and again, we don't even live together. This is because we fight all the time, and because of my BPD, those fights often spiral out of control. I have hurt myself numerous times in front of him (mostly hitting myself, but sometimes more), and I have been physical with him, which I know is never ok. Last night I slapped his arm and he got really mad, understandably. I feel like a stupid kid when I do stuff like this, but also, I am getting older and I want to be settling down and starting a family. It's all I've ever wanted. But my boyfriend says that my negative coping mechanisms make him fearful of what would happen if we lived together. We've already had the police called on us twice, and the second time (which was last month), I was sent to the psych ward against my will for 3 days because I admitted to sometimes thinking about dying. It was horrible and scary and not very helpful at all other than that it got me a prescription for Lexapro. Anyway, I am trying hard. I am taking meds, I have been actively looking for a DBT therapist (or any therapist!) but am having such a hard time finding one that is accepting new patients and accepts my insurance. I am reading all I can about BPD. I have tried meditating, I try to do yoga, I try to attend 12 step meetings for codependence and love addiction. But he keeps saying he wants my coping mechanisms to change before we can live together. He says it's not an ultimatum, but that's what it sounds like to me. I just don't understand why I'm good enough to keep being his girlfriend, but not good enough to move forward in our relationship. If I am not giving him what he needs, why doesn't he leave? He says it's because he loves me and has hope that things can change. It feels horrible feeling like somebody is sitting around waiting for me to change in order for me to have access to the things I want in life.

So last week, many of you saw a big altercation between myself and a user in another sub. I know that I handled myself well and I'm proud of the way I represented all of us. 

Since then, I've been trying like hell to pretend it never happened, to ignore it and continue with my recovery. 

However, I have this feeling like it's not going away. I feel like I became notorious overnight in this corner of reddit, and I have no earthly clue how to deal with this. 

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you need help or support that you think I can provide. I'm not talking about that at all, I promise. It's more that.. frankly, I don't know what I'm doing half the time, and I feel fraudulent that some people think I've got things figured out or under control. 

I love to share what works for me, and I have a way of explaining things that others with BPD can easily understand. That's fantastic and I'm happy to help. 

Just so long as we're all clear that I'm just another regular old user with BPD.

125,Am I using BPD as an excuse for my actions?,"This post will be quite lengthy, but I’m glad I stumbled upon this thread because I’m aware I do need to talk about this.

I was diagnosed with BPD 4 years ago. I learned I had it when a relationship of mine crumbled because of my emotional outbursts. I would become verbally abusive, majorly depressed and unmotivated, I would imagine scenarios in my head, get mad/worried and react to that scenario with my emotions. Eventually that person got “broken down” to the point where he left me. After I had realized I did have BPD, I tried to help myself. I did DBT, I was and currently am on anti depressants. The breakup was extremely hard on me but I managed to get through it. Things were better for a while. 

I then met a new man, a couple years later. We immediately hit it off. I realize now looking back, that I was doing pretty good managing my emotions with this guy. Maybe it was because I had still shielded myself from opening up to him because I was scared. I felt “normal” then. 

Flash forward to the present. That guy I just told you about is my fiancé. The problem is for the past 3 months, I’ve become increasingly more verbally abusive, depressed again and unmotivated. I react like it’s the end of the world if some girl he had flings with follows him on Instagram or something. I’m fully aware of what’s happening here- it seems ridiculous that i would even care. But for some reason I do. This time around in this relationship, I know all about BPD.  I tell him about BPD. I constantly say “I have an illness that’s controlling me” and he says I use it as an excuse. That it can’t justify my actions, the words I’ve said, how I’ve hurt him. And he’s right- I have hurt him. I’ve said I hated him and didn’t want to be with him, what I thought I meant at the time. After a few hours the guilt of what I said eats me alive. 

What do you think, is it BPD that’s causing me to act this way. I’m very self aware, that’s also  my dilemma. I’m aware I shouldn’t be reacting this way to certain situations, but In the moment I do anyways. And I don’t know how to stop it. I fear I may lose him for good if I continue to keep this up, and losing him would absolutely devastate me.",1522033269.0,False,7,5,maren1893,None,875yi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/875yi6/am_i_using_bpd_as_an_excuse_for_my_actions/
126,So Stuck RN,"I have had periods of being very well emotionally regulated, mostly when I am modeling good behaviors/actions for others. What ultimately happens is I am so focused on others that I forget to tend to myself. I’ve had a few bottoms. One came during the plague with social isolation. I then got a WFH job and social engagements got super hard for me. Looking back I can almost see my self completely unwind. Stop going to gym, stop journaling, stop meditating, stopped taking showers, changing clothes, brushing teeth, then stopped taking my medications bc if I take the ADHD meds I feel locked inside my head and almost paralyzed on the outside. By this time my head had 8 different trains of thought on 6 tracks and at least one wants me to unsubscribe from life and they constantly whirl around up there. I asked for accommodations from my company and they then found a reason to fire me (Top sales rep, most customer compliments) and I tail spun. 

So I swore I would unsubscribe from life before giving up my 325ft studio apartment (bc it was mine and I paid for it all by myself) and move back in with my parents. Soooo…..my brother let me crash with him. My head was so dark and so mean to me that getting out of bed seemed impossible. Sublet the studio to someone who is trashing it and also wants to sleep with me. (Uggggg)

So now, I have done EMDR, ART, DBT, CBT and I’m therapy and have a psych and I’m still in this rut where I JUST DONT CARE ABOUT MYSELF AT ALL ANYMORE. It’s like the spark or fire went out. I can’t seem to find it. Brother was paying for top tier therapy and now it’s been downgraded to better help. He’s upset he’s not getting a return on investment bc I haven’t been able to be more regulated for the last 2 years. 

I’ve gained over 100lbs in 2 years thanks to gastroparesis from Weygovi/Ozempic/Rybelsus. 

I now have a bedroom that I operate out of and while my brother can be super encouraging and supportive, lately I only hear what I’m doing bad/wrong.

Now dad has had heart issues, step sis going thru divorce from a narcissist - she has two kids 4/9 and she’s a flight attendant with her own Truman’s manifesting in such dysfunction rn. (Which is effecting the kids)

I can show up for my dad and step sis and my niece and nephew and lately, I put the very disassociated mask on where I’m modeling good behaviors, showering, changing clothes, doing laundry, doing sisters dishes and laundry and going to doctor appointments. Did I make my psych appt this month…nope. Dad in hospital. 

When those duties/obligations end…..I deflate back into a dark hole who doesn’t really care if I see tomorrow. 

2018-2022 I racked up over 30k in debt, so there’s a bankruptcy that gets to happen, and I’ve asked multiple people to be my body double so I can sit down and get the information I need so I can file it. Currently, if I go back to work, one of my more aggressive lenders will get a judgement and garnish my wages. It’s so traumatizing for me that I did this to myself that I don’t feel safe doing it alone. 

I filed for disability bc it’s actually proving that me acting as the Geico duck in the boat plugging all the multiple holes (my family’s needs) is enough to be a full time job and I have adhd, ptsd, BPD, anxiety, agoraphobia, social anxiety. I don’t have clothes that fit. So I have mostly pajamas. I hate going in public and won’t do social things. And I’m so dysregulated rn that I couldn’t imagine working part or full time doing anything. 

I don’t know how or when we crossed that tipping line of full heartedly believing that my life is worthless. I don’t matter, I don’t want to be here, and have made certain promises to not do the thing I really want to do while parents are alive, or in family’s house. (This is one area where black and white thinking is helping me.) I care more about NOT inflicting trauma on my family than I care about myself.

I very much wish that I felt/believed/desired like I was capable of going back to giving a fuck, and taking my meds, and showering and looking forward to working out, wanting to be social, enjoying life rather than I have XYZ task that drains my batteries and takes all my spoons so now I need 4 days to recharge. It’s exhausting. 

I cannot seem to create and keep a routine bc nothing is routine. I’m pulled to take care of the kids or dad has new appts nearly every week. I’ve lost enjoyment and fulfillment in the things that used to make me happy like painting or singing. 

Everything hurts, every muscle aches. I don’t feel like stretching helps.

I find that I am seeing or aware of every flaw of my body and limitations since gaining all this weight. I could go on and on.

I’m getting frustrated at my limitations and when the frustration hits I’m not able to positively spin it to find a way to overcome it, the frustration is too loud and draining and before I can even acknowledge it and catch it to try to reframe it, my batteries are dead. 

I don’t know where to start or what to do first. I assume it’s one little thing to the next. I just don’t know how to do it when i genuinely don’t want to be here and don’t care. I am truly stuck. Like stuck stuck. 

Anyone with any experience with this apathy and stuckness, I’d really like some help from people who have been where i am and found a way to care again.

I live in the US and our mental health resources are limited and sorely underfunded and my family doesn’t have the resources to put me in a nice place for 90 days that would force me to have a routine.

127,FRUSTRATION STATION,"Hey all. Thanks for having me here. 

I'm (27 FtM) struggling to prioritize in my life. Having finally gotten some self awareness on the borderline patterns of attachment, obsession, and trying to break out of this cycle of centering my life around unattainable or unavailable people, living in fantasy worlds, being super self absorbed, venting and only talking to people when I want attention, validation etc. that is keeping me from moving forward, gaining skills, etc. Everyone is so frustrated with me and I have had to come to terms with being emotionally abusive/neglectful to my ex, neglectful at my jobs and of my pets and self. 

It feels very awkward and unnatural and forced to try to be consistent in friendship, my habits, life. I never have had serious addictions besides social media and other peoples approval. 

Im exhausted. But I know I do have habits and can form new ones because I definitely have bad ones like laying in bed all morning or spending a lot of time in my head. 
Its just that every single day my mood is different even on mood stabilizers and I'm used to doing what I feel like impulsively based on mood, or what I'm forced to do. Which is a surefire way to spin out of control or feel hopeless. I need to develop my OWN locus of control and discipline and its just shitty that my moods are the enemy when they so badly crave validation after decades of gaslighting and being blamed for their intensity and destructive power. 

Im wondering for those who are actively recovering...what has really really helped you out of old coping mechanisms? What were you able to commit to?

I am PDA autistic and have ADHD or bipolar, still waiting on a psych evaluation, but one of my biggest struggles is finding something to be consistent with that doesn't end up trashed by demand avoidance or getting bored/splitting on it. 

Every kind of routine or demand outside of my fixations ends up feeling like swallowing pills or pinching your nose to eat something nasty until I just stop. 

 Everyone says to fight depression, meditate find hobbies and get outside yourself find something to do for others, exercise. 
But I legitimately feel my habits and mental copes are like gravity or a black hole and getting out of them or making changes in life exhausts me and I collapse back into them. 

I guess this is just what recovery is like. But I've tried Codependents Anonymous, talk therapy, astrology, divination, meds (except ADHD meds about to start those), being more social, creative expression. At the end of the day my brain always finds a way to invalidate destroy or get convinced that thing ""isn't it."" The only thing I come back to is taking pictures on my phone (never organized) and writing long rants on the internet. Im so bored of my SELF. And analyzing myself and recounting my past trauma.. everyone else seems to somehow find something to do, or to love, or commit to,, even when we have the same diagnosis and experiences. 
Ughhhhhhhhhh. 

Is it really possible to form an identity and learn how to commit? 

I'm so tired from fighting myself. 

It feels like a normal life is just within reach if I could follow the steps (apply for jobs, show up to jobs, budget the money, move put of home state, take care of my body, cook and eat, have a creative routine, go on a run, care for my pet, evaluate which relationships are good to have around, spend time in nature, set boundaries, learn time management, learn emotional regulation) so I can get to a place where I feel stable enough to really connect with others and not sabotage everything or get hurt because I picked someone wrong.

 But those steps feel so impossible when I keep proving to myself over and over that I will not stick with anything, I will sabotage everything, and every single day I have a new idea about my next big project or career path or what ever. 

How do you build trust with yourself or anyone else without consistent effort? 
The only way I feel motivated is to get a FP or romantic interests approval, or extreme outside pressure and fear of punishment. 

Im just so frustrated I could scream for days. 

Does it get better? And how! Does DBT help with this? 

Consistency is literally the key to unlocking life, and I feel like someone tossed it into a vat of concrete Im supposed to chip away at with my fingernails.

128,Chaos,"(Tw: talk of suicide attempts, assault and breakups)

Hey everyone so I posted about a week and a half ago on some of these subreddits about my polyamorous relationship and had been looking for advice, I appreciated all the comments but I thought I should update on the events that played out.

So Friday of one of the weeks (my timelines a little blurry) I was laying in bed with my live in partner and he hyped me up to go on an adventure with him and despite having been fine laying in bed all day I got excited and started to get ready for our adventure.. midway through he told me that our two partners who had been having complaints about me needed him there by 5 pm (2.5 hours away from the current time but he had agreed to hang out til 9 pm) I expressed my disappointment and how uncomfortable it made me feeling left out and feeling abandoned.. (I added this part in because I'm trying to get everything in and forgot to add this part it was also part of why I wanted to talk written below)

I communicated my discomfort with my live in partner about the polycule and explained how I didn't feel like 2 of the others really understood me so I explained that I'd like all 5 of us to sit down and have a conversation (for the benefit of this story we have partner A and B that live together, Partner C that lives with me and partner D that lives alone but is best friends as well with partner B) 

C explained to A and B that I was uncomfortable and would like to have a sit down to talk about things because as it stood I felt unheard, judged and uncomfortable in our situation and I had spoke to him that night about it on the phone and I thought I was finally getting through to some extent..

I met up with C the next day and found out that he slept with B that night (this was the first time and he had also kissed her) this hurt my feelings a lot because I felt so unheard and disrespected so I needed to take a whole step back from the situation so I left our groups for the time being, blocked both A and B and I had a panic attack where I called my best friend because he told me out in public so I was literally sobbing and hyperventilating in public.. I had no problem with the fact that they slept together but just how disrespectful it was as I did my best to communicate my feelings.. I asked C to tell A and B I needed space and just couldn't right now.

After spending most of the night in a conversation with C where I was having a break down and my best friend sat there to be a bystander to make sure neither of us did anything dumb C ended up getting A and B to pick him up and breaking up with me.

The next day when I woke up and had calmed down and had been communicating lots with D between then and the morning both D and C told me I shouldn't message A and B but I felt bad for abruptly leaving and wanted to express I was sorry and explain my side of the story.. 

A mostly kept quiet and just sent me a link to a mental health place but said he didn't want to talk to me which was fine I respected that and I did not reply afterwards.

B however went off on a huge rant about how I apparently have been abusing C for 4 years and he has Stockholm and all this stuff and then told me to disappear.. for that day it really really got in my head and I found everything unbearable my brain hyper fixated so I shut off my location on everything and went to get medication and I wrote a note with no ill will or hard feelings to anyone inside just letting people know I always loved them and that I was sorry I had to do this.. I had blocked B on some social media but then she started going off texting me unprompted making it go into my head harder..

I had been messaging D all day and he could tell I was not alright and I took a lot of medication after a while and asked if he was scared to die.. I felt extremely alone.. word got out to everyone and my best friend rushed to my house and C got A and B to drive him to my house.

B came into my house and tried to lunge at me, I had to slam the door to separate us as I'm a passafist and don't like conflict and I was very confused why she was trying to attack me after telling me to disappear and telling me I had no redeeming qualities..

Once she left the house I came out and realized my phone was gone so I went upstairs and opened the front door to ask C if he had my phone and B was closed by and lunged at me again, again I made a barrier by slamming the door and things are a blur but I think I hit her with the door because I remember once I opened it again A got in my face but he didn't touch me so I can at least respect that.. 

C did have my phone so I had went outside to get it from him and I was standing near him and like balling my eyes out and my best friend showed up, B attacked me again but this time I had no wall to put between us she was grabbing and pulling me but a cop had shown up and saw it and he shoved her away from me and told her to go to her car.. I was urged to press charges but I have chose not to do this because I just want peace not violence.. I'm exahusted..

Once in the hospital they went through the normal steps of poison control and all that I won't go into too much detail but my best friend stayed with me til really late at night (she has a child and her brother isn't old enough to watch him for too long) 

The next day I spoke to the psychologist who deemed me not a threat to myself and let me leave but she has put me on a waiting list for a DBT program and I was already waiting on a counselling appointment on the 10th so she was happy with that. She told me she believes I did my best by stepping back from a situation that had triggered a lot of emotions so I didn't blow up and that I also made the steps to resolve the issue afterwards and she told me that I can't control how others react to what I say.. she's right but it's still hard..

Since then I have had 0 contact with A and B, C has visited a couple of times and I've been doing my best.. D and I message every single day and he's visited over night once and has also had a long phone call with me.. he's been my biggest support and every time I see or talk to C it feels suffocating.. I can feel his disinterest and it hurts.. anyways I just guess I wanted to give an update so I didn't leave anyone hanging since I know there's replies I hadn't gotten to because everything happened so fast.. anyways I'm single now and trying to find some kind of motivation to live.. I want to be motivated but as it stands breathing is even exhausting and I'm only living because other people don't want me to die and I know that's no way to live.",1712535842.0,False,5,1,PsychoLittleKitten,None,1byk0yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1byk0yj/chaos/
129,I can’t believe I’m doing this,"TRIGGER WARNING: suicide, self harm and all that bad mental health stuff. (Sorry if I did that wrong). 

Hi redditors. I’ve never posted before. Thanks for reading and responding if you choose to do so. I’m sorry if the following triggers you or if you are struggling with the same brand of futile terrible I am. 

I’m at a point in my life where I’ve struggled so much and for so long that I’m just exhausted. I’m not angry or bitter or sad anymore; I just want it to be over. I’m tired of being confused all the time, completely disconnected from this thing called ‘life’ everyone seems to be switched into. I’m tired of being panicky and depressed and anxious all at the same time, almost all the time. Im tired of being at the mercy of my insane mood swings where I'm experiencing overlapping interchanges of all these conflicting emotions all day long. I'm tired of crying so often that it feels like my brain is going to explode in my own head and my eyes will just cease to function properly. I’m tired of being dismissed when I say I’m unwell (psychiatrist included) because ‘I’m doing so well’ - I don’t even know what this means or how you could conclude that from someone whose chronically unemployed, can’t finish uni or even leave the house or make eye contact with people without panicking. I feel like an absolute rotting turd most of the time despite what I’m putting out there (which feels to me like a shit show but to other people for some reasons seems completely normal).

People seem to consistently make this crazy assumption that I’m ‘intelligent and capable’ for some reason and therefore I don’t need help. They couldn’t be more wrong. I can’t accomplish basic tasks because I’m emotionally all over the place all the time and trying to do basic human things like pick what to wear in the morning sends me into shame spirals, suicidal thoughts and urges to self harm. I have no control over my emotions or impulses, I’m constantly floating away from my body and nothing feels real. I’m incapable of accepting any kind of affection or goodwill from others without completely self destructing and I don’t want to burden others so my relationships are nonexistent. 

I’ve dealt with thoughts, feelings, urges and attempts of suicide my entire life. Its pretty much always been a terrifying backup in the back of my mind ever since I can remember as a safety plan to escape the torture of life where I can always feel exactly how close I am to death. Some days feel a magnetism to it but a strong resolve to resist. Other days, I’m basically hanging on by a thread and not telling anyone so they don’t come and take me from my home against my will again. 

I just want the freedom to be able to make this decision on my own. I did not give consent to be born, and I don’t think it’s ethical to keep someone alive against their will when they are suffering chronically and there isn’t a solution. 

I just feel like there’s no way out. I don’t respond to medications and suffer from such severe side effects that my psychiatrist refuses to prescribe any more drugs. My old psychiatrist had me on 5 different meds and I was equally bad, maybe worse, but in a completely different way. Those who have had adverse reactions to medications will understand this. Being mentally ill or being on psychiatric medication is like choosing if you want death by drowning or self-immolation.

I do DBT group therapy, see a psychologist and psychiatrist but I still feel like absolute shit. Everyone seems to be going through the motions, ticking all the boxes, but I just feel like nothing has really shifted. No amount of bandaids is going to help me when I’m walking around absolutely raw with no fucking skin on my body. It’s excruciating to just be alive but because it’s not visible, and it’s a slow death, nobody cares and the state ‘has a responsibility’ to keep you alive. In my experience, everyone is all sad when someone kills them selves, but also calls them selfish because they’ve left so much pain in their wake. Being passed around a mental health care system that can’t really help you, is insanely expensive and practically useless makes me miss the days when I didn’t seek help, suffered in silence but could at least hold on to the hope that there was a possibility of getting better if I had the right help. Now I know that’s not even an option. 

I’m just doomed to relive this cycle of extreme pain, possible suicide, absurdity, exhaustion, sheer terror, panic attacks, extreme mood swings, paranoia, catatonia, confusion, dissociation, spontaneous stuttering, paralysis and fatigue, where I can’t seem to express myself clearly no matter how hard I try or connect with other people. 

I am incapable of feeling positive emotions. No matter how hard I try, I just can’t stop the anxiety, panic, negativity, paranoia and depression from seeping in. I fear my emotions, I fear my thoughts and the things in life I can’t control that are going to hurt me so I just live in a constant state of sheer paralysis, frozen in fear and bracing myself for impact.

The only thing that’s keeping me alive is the thought that my sister will have to deal with the trauma of my suicide. But it also seems like it should be unethical to keep a person in this much chronic pain alive. I can feel my body deteriorating, my mind is basically scrambled eggs at this point, and I feel like I’m at the mercy of an emotionally handicapped body that I have zero control over. I keep harming myself and those around me. I just want to die with a little bit of dignity but there doesn’t seem to be a way out.

Life seems to be one trauma after the next, and continued reluctant attempts to help myself that only end up in things getting worse. I was not made for this world. I wasn’t supposed to be here. Please let me go. I don’t want to hurt anyone but I’m so tired now. Please tell me this will all be over soon.",1596368916.0,False,12,7,sarahthehumanperson,None,i2asxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/i2asxt/i_cant_believe_im_doing_this/
130,Organization/time management/focus skills for BPD???,"Hello everyone. Based on my title does anyone know any good skills for any of those? I'm starting my college classes back up again and I decided to take 1 class instead of what I was doing last fall semester which was 4. I first went into college as a full time student taking 4 classes all on campus. A little bit on my educational/mental health background. I have **anxiety, generalized anxiety** (idk if that's the same thing as just anxiety) **ADD, BPD, VCFS**, and because of VCFS I have a few learning disabilities. I was on IEP classes for math and english starting from 3rd grade on. I dropped the english IEP class in *7th grade* but continued on w/ the math IEP class all the way throughout highschool. So I've always struggled w/ math, esp when it comes to reading and figuring out word math problems. I also have issues w/ reading long and complicated things. For example I had to read a book in my sophomore year called Killing Kennedy. I don't remember how many chapters it was but the book I just looked up was 336 pgs long and the chapters felt like at least anywhere from 20-50 pages long. I think some were even a little longer than that. So not only was it really long, it had words I didn't understand so I would constantly have to look them up to figure out what it means in case it was on a test/quiz, and I would also have to annotate in the book (they always made annotating so confusing, esp in that class) and there was so much descriptive words so it made it hard to read because there was a lot of words that you had to memorize for the test. By words, I don't mean every word of course, more so on the lines of memorizing specific dates, names, etc..... 

&#x200B;

 So w/ the learning disabilities I mentioned above you can imagine how hard that was for me. And that was just one class I remember from my sophomore year of highschool. This was like this for me my first year of college, which is this year. I got into college expecting that there would be a lot of work. But my expectations were much lower than what my sched was going to look like. So when it was around the 5 week mark of school I was extremely stressed because I had been staying up late at night, so late sometimes it would be 4 at the latest and that week I had pulled 2 all nighters studying for a test. Of course I don't believe these were actually all nighters but they were all nighters for me because I hadn't done that before. What I do for studying for tests is I use Quizlet which is a website (now an app on the iPad) that you can type in flashcards and it creates flashcard sets for you where you can learn/study, play matching games w/ your sets, it'll even create tests for you as well. So I spend most of my time doing that because this is my first year of college, I have no idea what to study. I remember emailing my teacher one time about what to study for the test and he just said to study the powerpoint slides he had on the website that he posted in which didn't help much at all because there weren't any specific sections. So I ended up spending all day in the library typing up flashcards, and didn't even finish because I had one paper to write and one paper to correct. So I finished the paper and went to the writing lab so that they could help me proofread my essay. So I was so exhausted by the end of that week, that I told myself I was just going to take a week off and I hadn't even finished all my assignments for that week I believe I was a little bit behind as well so I emailed my teachers about what I was stressed about and they gave me extensions on stuff I was behind on and stuff I hadn't turned in which was extremely nice of them because I had heard from my mom that was pretty unheard of that they were being generous like that. I know if I had been at a regular college (and I go to a community college) they probably would've given half off of credit since it was late/not turned in. Well by the end of that week, still haven't finished everything and I had to catch up from all the work I had missed from that week off and I was still pretty stressed. a couple of months went by and I was just falling more behind, and more assignments hadn't gotten done or had been turned in so I decided to email my counselor and I told her I had to drop out. So I had to get a letter from my psychiatrist and therapist saying that I had to drop out and to please give me an excuse due to my mental illnesses something like that. And what was going on between that time I was back after that week off, and the time I emailed my counselor I had gotten depressed and my anxiety had gotten worse and my BPD target issues were getting in the way as well and were becoming a distraction which was a huge part of why I was falling behind in the first place. 

&#x200B;

So my main point being from all this, for one I need a new study strategy. I remember my therapist, counselor (from school), and my mom were all saying to write down just the important stuff on the powerpoint slides and print the powerpoint slides out so you can write on it. They said to underline the stuff that the professor has said multiple times in a row, or throughout class, or if they say it'll be on a test/exam/quiz later on the week. I have a question about this one. Has this worked for any of you who are in college at the moment, or were in college? I feel like this might work, and I did try it once, but I would sometimes forget to print the powerpoint slides out and I believe I had Adobe Acrobat which you could write on PDF documents, so I guess I could've used that but at the time I didn't know what that was for. I had heard of the program but I didn't know what you could use it for. Has anyone tried this idea? Has it worked for them? Or have you used a similar idea? I need a new method for studying for tests/quizzes/exams and esp exams because the exams I usually have are at least 50 questions but most of them are either worded funny to where they don't make sense, or I just can't remember (mostly cause I stayed up late that night before studying & typing in quizlet sets) I also have a question about organization for college. I had 4 classes as I mentioned above. I kept 4 binders. I would keep them at home, I would also have a folder, which I called a take home folder just like back in grade school but this time for college. For notes I would write them down in my notebook that I had if my computer wasn't dead otherwise I would type my notes. For me typing my notes or typing anything really helps my thoughts flow smoothly so it helps me figure out what I'm typing down and it also makes the process faster. When I write I feel like I get stuck and also I write w/ a lot of pressure esp if it's a lot to write down and when it's a powerpoint I know their going to skip ahead and I don't want to slow the class down so I tend to write pretty fast and my wrist/hand/fingers get really cramped up. But my interpersonal communications teacher was saying it was better to write notes than type for memory. Which I've actually been told that a lot but I still continue to type. Does anyone relate to this? If so what did you do to figure this out? I think another problem I had was my distractions and target behaviors getting in the way. And for those who don't know what a target behavior is, it's a DBT term and it means that it's basically an unhealthy coping mechanism. At least that's how I think of it I'm not sure of the correct definition. So when that would get in the way, I would spend hours doing that. I won't say exactly what my target behavior was, although it does happen to do something w/ my phone. But I would spend all day, or whenever my break was that I had set for my break time from my work and I would spend all that time plus after the time when my break was supposed to end. And because my sleep sched was already off from the beginning before college I would take naps during the day because my eyes and body would be exhausted from my bad sleep sched.  So when I was on my phone my eyes would eventually get tired and I would fall asleep and my naps usually last quite a few hours. Once again I ask does anyone relate to this? Maybe not the specific target issue but at least the distractions of mental health issues getting in the way of your work? And how did you solve your issues or what ideas did you come up w/? I believe these are all the questions I had. If I come up w/ anymore I'll edit this of course but if anyone has any advice I'd love to hear it.

131,Canadian mental health's week,"This week is Canadian mental health’s week.

I cannot remain silent. I have witnessed so many prejudices related to different mental illnesses. And I have been victim myself of some prejudices related to my mental illness.

I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and I have an eating disorder (ED). 

I am trying really hard to recover from my eating disorder. It has been a year since I am in therapy and take medication. Even though I am on the path of recovery, I am still sick. My day-to-day existence is still challenging. I have been victim of many misconceptions people have about my disease. Today, I want to break those misconceptions. 

First of all, I have gone to my family doctor before my eating disorder went out of control. I’ve told my doctor I was worried about the relationship I had with food. I’ve told her that every time I felt angry, sad or anxious about something, I ate. I’ve told her that I often got up at night to eat things I didn’t allow myself to eat at daytime. I’ve told her that I was sometimes craving for junk food. I’ve told her that I was often eating so much that I felt a pain in my stomach. I’ve also told her that I was constantly checking my weight because I was worried that I was weighing more than my friends. Those are the common symptoms of an eating disorder. My doctor didn’t take me seriously. She didn’t consider my eating behaviors as a problem. Actually, she told me it was quite common among teenagers to like junk food and to eat “too much”. 

For a couple of years, back in high school, my eating behaviors remain the same. I was stealing money from my mother’s purse to buy junk food. I was hiding food in places where my mother could not find it such as my room’s closet. I had drawers filled with wrappers. 

Then, it got worse. Two years ago, I had convinced myself that I had some kind of virus and that I couldn’t digest food anymore. For a week, I had stopped eating. My close ones were worried but they didn’t question my behavior because I had convinced them I had a virus. When I started to eat again, food disgusted me so much that I felt like I couldn’t keep it: I had to throw it all away. And that is what I started to do.  At first, I told my parents that I was throwing up because of the virus. But, it kept getting worse. I could barely eat with them. And when I did, I ate a ridiculously small amount of food. I was throwing up after each meal. And I had started to skip meals. In a matter of a few months, I had lost a lot a weight (something like 25 pounds). At one point, I couldn’t concentrate at school anymore. I was feeling weak. I was feeling anxious around others. At that time, all I wished for was to disappear completely. I told my parents I needed to go to therapy. I knew something was wrong but I didn’t know what it was. My first therapist diagnosed me with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), related to a sexual assault I had been victim of a couple of years before.  Then, I was diagnosed with Depression. Then, I was diagnosed with social anxiety. Then, they found out I had an eating disorder: I was diagnosed with bulimia nervosa. Finally, after a suicide attempt and a stay at the hospital, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). 

I have found it really difficult to hear about the final diagnosis because I knew that this one was accurate. When my therapist first described to me the symptoms of BPD, all I could think was: «It is me. It is all me. Is it all that I am? Am I a disease?» For those of you who don’t know much about BPD, there are nine specific symptoms to this illness but you only need to have five of them to be diagnosed with it. First of all, BPDs fear abandonment. That’s why BPDs make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. Because of that fear of abandonment, BPDs have unstable relationships. BPDs relationships are often intense and short-lived. Also, BPDs have unstable self-image. BPDs may feel good about themselves for a short period of time and then hate themselves. BPDs often don’t know their needs and desires. They may change values, goals, and even sexual identity. Because of their unclear self-image, BPDs engage in impulsive or self-destructive behaviors such as self-harm, risky sex, alcohol or drug abuse, binge eating. Those self-destructive behaviors can lead to suicidal behavior. BPDs also have intense emotional swings. They are described as hypersensitive. In fact, Marsha Linehan, the psychologist whom invented Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), which is now used to treat people with BPD, says: 
“People with BPD are like people with third degree burns over 90% of their bodies. Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement.” BPDs also experiences chronic feelings of emptiness due to their unstable self-image and their lack of self-confidence. BPDs can also struggle with intense anger and can have trouble controlling it. More frequently, BPDs direct their anger towards them. Finally, BPDs can experience episodes of paranoia where they feel suspicious about other’s motives and out of touch with reality.  That feeling can lead to out of body’s experiences. 

After I was diagnosed with BPD, I knew I had to tell my close ones. The impact of the symptoms on my life was so important: I could not pretend that they did not exist anymore. My therapist had warned me that the reactions to my diagnosis could be quite inadequate due to all the misconceptions people have about mental illnesses. Unfortunately, people often see BPD’s desperate calls for help as attention seeking. For example, that is often the way people feel about self-harm and suicidal behavior. Another common misconception is that people think that all BPD sufferers are extroverts. People think all BPDs express their intense emotions at the exact moment they feel them. In fact, some of us keep a lot of those emotions to ourselves. Sometimes, it is because we are not sure how to express those feelings. Sometimes, it is because we don’t even know how we feel: there are so many emotions trapped inside of us that ask to be released.  If you know someone suffering from BPD or from any other mental illness, you have to know there is no magic way to cure for those illnesses. The person who suffers from a mental illness has to be ready to recover and that feeling can only come from her. There is nothing you can do except stand by her side while she is trying her best to recover.  

I hope that my statement will help to demystify BPD and Bulimia Nervosa among some of you. And, I hope that those of you who suffer from any mental illness will feel less lonely. I also hope it will encourage you to speak up to stop the stigmatization of mental illnesses.

132,I don't know why I have BPD,"this is very long and i dont expect anyone to read it, its basically a breakdown of my life and how i went from a good little christian kid to whatever the fuck is going on with my life now
my bpd confuses me. I've always joked that I've was born with a broken heart because during my childhood, I can't really remember anything traumatic happening to me and I had a good home life, yet I loved sad music and I remember being very young, like 3-4 and praying to God (I was just raised religious and I am a trans man and those things did not mix well even though I didn't realize my gender identity was the cause of a lot of unrecognized dysphoria that I thought was just due to the fact that I was chubby until I was a Junior in high school) to take me to heaven now whenever I got yelled at. In middle school I always felt left out and inadequate. In high school, I was not popular and was never once pursued romantically or had reciprocated feelings for any of my classmates. And although I wasn't bullied, my roommate (religious boarding school)freshman often snuck out of our room to go hang out with our other friend and I remember spending nights crying and wondering why I wasn't enough for her. I started experiencing depressive episodes during the winter and during my sophomore year I tried to seek help because it wasn't going away during the spring this time and was met with a ""you seem fine you've got that real Jesus joy in your heart"". and then junior year I went into a depressive episode that hasn't really seemed to lift completely to this day. I cut myself daily and isolated myself a lot and started gaining weight, something that I hated because I was already overweight and hated my body. I remember praying and crying and wondering why I was feeling like this and why this was happening to me. I viewed myself as lazy, worthless, unloveable, and a complete failure at the ripe age of 17. I lost my faith, my ambitions, everything. I also realized that I was bisexual and trans and this further worsened the depression because I knew my parents would not approve. I was hiding everything from them and trying to hold myself together and ""cure"" myself by using a horrible system of cutting myself for not completing chores/homework that I needed to complete but had 0 motivation or energy to do. I wanted to take my life, but before I could work up the nerve to I opened up to my parents about how I was feeling about everything about the LGBT stuff. they got me an online Christian counselor who helped but I was still dealing with the LGBT aspects of my issues because I was afraid of being kicked out of my school or being sent to conversion therapy. I knew I couldn't deny these aspects of my identity because I knew they were things that I couldn't change, the problem was that every single person in my life was, although most not aggressively, homophobic and transphobic. I saw a light of sorts at the end of the tunnel at graduation, and I figured if I could just make it out of high school and shatter the glass ceiling on my current life, then everything would be better. Senior year I took Lexapro and it didn't really seem to help, but I continued to take it. Unfortunately I gained more weight because of binge eating and was around 240lbs, not that much but I was easily one of the largest people in my school. I had an online girlfriend who told me she loved me and then later said she never meant it when we broke up. I started smoking cigarettes and weed and spent a lot of my time alone because half of the time when I tried to hang out with anyone I felt like I didn't really belong. I felt like a lot like I was on the outside of my own life and looking in. At this point I was also very bad and still am at taking care of myself, which I am very embarrassed about and am working on. I didn't shower as much as I should, I woke up with only 5 minutes to get to class, and really just kind of blundered through life because I was using all my energy on just keeping myself alive. Finally, I graduated, and things looked like they were getting better. I came out to my parents, and my previous good relationship with them tanked. things were weird, they acted like I was this whole new person but I still felt like I was just me. This hurt because of the obvious disapproval of the true me, in identity and opinions and personal values. this is still a source of contention with my dad mostly but I've learned to just tolerate his unacceptance of my gender identity. I felt alone and ostracized in my own house and college was the way I finally began to branch out into the real world. I met my best friend, began smoking weed daily which I think has proven mostly beneficial to me but I will not deny this may be problematic as well. I hung out with my new friend and then her friends who have become most of my current social circle daily and was never in the house. I took a break from college which turned into dropping out because I was changing career paths and found my passion in dog grooming, which was great. as I worked and had money to spend though, problems began arising. at this point I had started to feel somewhat out of control of myself, staying up too late before working in the morning, starting to do party drugs occasionally like Ecstasy, ect. while at home feeling like I was stuck in the past. I noticed that when I was out with my friends and living my own life, I was happy and although erratic and overly sensitive to feeling the need to belong and be inlcluded in everything, but as soon as i stepped foot through the door of my house i could feel my mood start to tank. I only even slept on nights when i worked in the morning. I felt the need to be able to do everything with my new friends and keep up, and i deeply needed them to like me. I was still unhappy with my weight, although beginning to like my appearance as i was able to present as my true gender. I am a hopeless romantic and have always wanted to settle down and get married. I had a lot of trouble finding love and felt unnattractive and undesirable. I also spent my money impulsively and was often broke and struggled to make it through a week on a part time paycheck. Because i spent so much time away from home and didn't have much money, I often skipped meals in favor of a pack of cigs or whatever random thing i was focused on. Because i was eating less and stiffled my appetite with cigarettes, i started to notice a loss of weight. I have never been athletic and especially now since i ran myself ragged constantly socializing or working, I've never consistently worked out or really seen any weight loss. So I started to skip meals on purpose occasionally and not just to save money. I desperately wanted to be skinny, something I've never been. It didnt get to be a problem until later when i really started to drop weight. First though, in late 2018 I met my current boyfriend and although it's only been about a year and a half, I'm certain he's the love of my life, and he feels the same. However, with all good things there are problems. He had a rough childhood and because of it has a lot of very difficult mental problems himself. At this point, i had stopped taking my meds after beginning walbutrin to combat how dull lexapro made me feel emotionally at times. I didnt like how irritable it made me and i barely remembered to take my meds anyways, and i was feeling elated with a new relationship and thought it was a good idea. i don't regret it because although i spiralled into a depression enough to admit myself to a hospital for a short while. They diagnosed me with bipolar 2 which didnt really seem to fit right since the hospital seemed to diagnose everyone with some kind of bipolar disorder and gave everyone abilify, the worst medication i have ever taken. Meanwhile, my boyfriend, B, was going through one of the worst mental health years of his life, and I tried to support him the best that I could. I definitely tended to ignore my own needs to help his objectively much more serious issues. I was also doing more drugs and just got a promotion from bather to groomer and had to transfer to a new store. I was very close to my coworkers at my first store but i didnt fit in with the other salon workers at the new location. I was feeling very out of touch with my social circle and extremely stressed out. Then one day, B had a very bad dissociative episode and didn't recognize me. I felt completely useless and pointless, especially since that morning I had also slept through my alarm for work; again. I remeber bursting into tears before getting my best friend, who i now lived with, to comfort B because I all I could think to do run. I then left the house and got into my car fall apart. I noticed Bs nightmare medication and zoloft, and without a second thought downed the entire bottle of prazosin and drove to a park. I then swallowed a handful of zoloft for good measure before i got a call from my best friend. When i got back to the house (god knows how i didnt wreck my car because i was definitely starting to feel the effects) They knew what was up immediately and then I was hospitalized for a second time, only a month after the first visit. Before my first hospital visit, I discovered one of my worst vices: cocaine. While i enjoyed other drugs, not counting weed, I didn't really care to seek them out on my own. But i fell in love with coke. i loved the way it made me feel physically, and finally the persistent exhaustion of being alive lifted and i felt like i could actually focus on something long enough to accomplish it. I was a nasty habit that gave me panic attacks, made me somehow even broker, and by the end of it I had gone from 240lbs to 160lbs since it made not eating even easier. I was also even more tired and irritated constantly. Thankfully my best friend had dealt with an eating disorder in highschool and called me out and helped me start eating better again. And then B and I tried meth. It was amazing, but it was also the fucking worst. We only did it twice, and the first time I personally only had a long, irritating comedown, but B dissociated so hard he thought he was 16 again for 3 days. The next time we did it i started to see things and have panic attacks at the thought of having to go to work in the morning. I called into work and that day we broke up because I wanted to get clean and he didn't. The next day we talked when we were clear headed we got back together, him now ready to quit too. I'm incredibly lucky that we got out when we did from meth because it would have destroyed us. Its something i still fear that I'll relapse into again, even though i dont really miss it except when I'm feeling especially dead inside. I told my mom about my drug use and this prompted a visit to a new psychiatrist who diagnosed me with BPD. It's nice to finally find a diagnosis that seemed to actually fit. I'm doing better right now, relatively. I found a medication that actually works, thank god for trileptal, B and I are mostly sober, the hardest thing we do now is acid every now and then, and we still smoke, just probably too much now. I've started DBT but had to stop because i got a new job and it didn't fit into my schedule, but now im on job number 3 of 2020 and its much more loosely scheduled so i can actually focus on my mental health for once in my life.
Anyways, the question I wanted to ask is I don't understand still why I have BPD. Everyone talks about how childhood trauama can ""cause"" it, and I know depression runs in the family, but not BPD. I come from a stable home where I was loved, although not really accepted but that wasn't until later on after my mental health started tanking. I feel guilty about it, and I can't help but think that I took a start for a good life and just shit all over it. I feel like such a family disappointment and I feel like im going to be stuck on this random, emotional rollercoaster forever and I'll just continue to destroy every good thing in my life. If i could pinpoint it to anything, I would think my roommate in freshman year sneaking out of our room might have been the start of the extreme fear of abandonment, but that seems like such a stupid, not traumatic or abusive at all thing to have caused me to go from who I was before, someone i can barely even remember what they were even like in terms of personality, to the dumpster fire ive become. Maybe theres some repressed memory of something happening to me, because I get asked if I was ever sexually assualted a lot, but I have no memory of anything like that ever happening and while I don't have a problem having sex mentally my body just doesn't seem to react that well to anyone other than myself. Maybe my brain chemistry is just that fucked that sometime as simple as a friend hanging out with someone else sometimes set it off. I just want to get to the root of the issue, any insight or if y'all also just want to spill your entire life story onto the internet feel free and I'll listen to you. Take care guys
tldr: I dont remember any trauma or abuse during childhood that would spark the BPD and I fear I may have some repressed memory or something, and I want to know why I have BPD so i can get better.",1589249403.0,False,5,6,dickfag69420,None,gi1w9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/gi1w9f/i_dont_know_why_i_have_bpd/

134,I need help,So I’m new here. Been diagnosed since 2015 or 2016. But all my therapists since haven’t been treating it. They just treated the depression anxiety and panic attacks. I feel like they did the bare minimum. I have no friends and my husband isn’t supportive i feel. Is there anyone here willing to be friends? I don’t feel I understand BPD and I feel lost. I want to die more than half the time but every time it comes to a point where I lose it I just spend a week in a psych ward and they send me home where things stay the same. I don’t know what to do anymore.,1592157118.0,False,7,5,Justinsgirl091914,None,h8yak9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/h8yak9/i_need_help/
