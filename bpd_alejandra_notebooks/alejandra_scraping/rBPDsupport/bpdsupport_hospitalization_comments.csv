I just went back to look at my main account post history and WOW. 

I‚Äôve changed so much in almost two years- apparently I still had a personality after my breakup. 

Living with my mother has changed me SIGNIFICANTLY for the worse.

0,"I'm looking from the outside and I'm male and bloody old so sorry I don't fit what you want and I completely understand wanting to speak to someone similar to you. I have been in a relationship with someone who suffered a lot, various attempts to end it, plus they suffered from DID as well as PTSD.

Deep breath.

You need to vent a bit somewhere safe. Even the odd primal scream in the woods might make you feel a bit better, not a cure but it might take the steam out a bit.

Other than that you really need someone to talk to where any fear of hospitalisation isn't present. No friends that might be that non-judgemental ear? Depending on where you are there are also some good help lines or PTSD charities that might be a good ear too.

The ideation to end it? Of course, I might be taking a risk here but I see that as a normal part of the process of being you. It doesn't always last and is really driven by a deep desire to NOT be you and you can only say that because of the memories you have that are negative. Again completely understandable. Just be aware that it can spiral downwards as a repetitive thought. That's very exhausting to have those thoughts every time you feel triggered or down.

Here's one key that applies to people having too many thoughts creating a desire to control or suppress them. Suppressing them can be the problem more than those thoughts actually exist being the problem. The tremendous desire to suppress them is probably more exhausting than having the thoughts in the first place! In other words, those thoughts are stressful when you're inside of them. They seem real and valid. If you manage to find a moment of peace and suddenly those thoughts come, look at them as if they are just a machine working in your head to try and make yourself feel in control. Let it go. It's going to happen anyway. The thoughts will come, and they will go. Allow them to go even if they seem stubborn and are sticking around. Put them in a place where you realise they are not who you really are. They are like a machine kicking off when the on button has been pushed. Kind of like a knee jerk reaction of the brain. You can practice this every day just by being aware of it rather than trying to control it. Be aware of it but it's really just babble in the background.

There is another part of you that isn't this. A deep and relevant part that can access something else other than thinking about bad thoughts.

With the PTSD you can try some of the trusted and true methods that bring your attention to the things around you. When you feel yourself going into a PTSD mode do things like look at the walls and their colour. Describe the light in the room. Use sensing as a way to connect with the reality of where you are rather than the thoughts in your head. Run cold water over your hands is another good one. It focuses your brain on the relevant and immediate world.

Much love.",NeerImagi,17yxzr7
0,"BPD surviving here, too. What I‚Äôm still trying to perfect is catching myself during intrusive thoughts and redirecting myself, if only for a few minutes. I think this has to be achieved in steps, that aren‚Äôt consecutive for a while until you‚Äôve made it a habit, and habits take patience, dedication, AND most importantly, forgiveness. Especially if this isn‚Äôt something one has tried/done before.

Step 1: Note when intrusive thoughts are occurring. eg, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm such a horrible person for going driving today, if I hadn‚Äôt, that person that flipped me off wouldn‚Äôt have done that‚Ä¶‚Äù Whether you identify this when you‚Äôre thinking or you correlate it to a feeling/sensation you get, it doesn‚Äôt matter, as long as your brain trips enough for you to notice ‚Äúoh, intrusive thoughts are happening.‚Äù Push yourself to then proceed to the next step (but if you can‚Äôt, FORGIVE yourself. It‚Äôs not a competition on whether you‚Äôre strong enough or good enough, it‚Äôs you pausing on the step you‚Äôre on and ruminating, taking a break.)

Step 2: Once you take this step, have a focal point that means something to you that you latch onto after identifying you‚Äôre in intrusive thought mode for a bit of reprieve. Basically choose something that you love (which is going to be used as a sort of coping mechanism). Is there anything that you‚Äôre currently geeking out about, etc?  A date, platonic or romantic or familial you‚Äôre excited about? A party or night in you want to plan? It could just be a happy memory or person, animal, object you feel fondly of. It could even be taking note of the area or objects around you; really looking at the sky and wondering if you can accurately guess the temperature or marveling at its color, or seeing an object and thinking ‚Äúif someone from the far future or distant past suddenly found it, what would they think of it?‚Äù

Step 3: *Experience* what you‚Äôve chosen. This is where you immerse yourself into letting go, however temporarily, of those intrusive thoughts, to pause yourself for reflection and feeling OUTSIDE of those spiraling thoughts. 

This is not the only way. And it might not be the right one for you. But I think that because you‚Äôve noted these thoughts have been painful and haunting you, and that you reached out somewhere, you‚Äôre a lot further along to the place you‚Äôd rather be. And that alone tells me you‚Äôre strong. So keep trying, keep experimenting with things, you will find a way.

But remember, give yourself grace even when those intrusive thoughts don‚Äôt want you to. While they are trying to protect you in a way, you also know better of the love you deserve from yourself.",the-panda-general,1ao2cka

It's such a hopeless place to be!!! And even more so when those in our lives can't/ won't help, or make it worse somehow. It sounds like you might need a different type of support in your life than what you currently have. (Easier said than done, I know...trust me I know.) I don't have any magic solutions, but here are some things that helped me at different times that could be helpful to look into, or hopefully even just distract you for a little while:
* Patrick Teahan is personally my favorite and has the most content. https://youtube.com/@patrickteahanlicswtherapy?si=xyLPH_H-FwQh8ZJS
* Dr. Kim Sage is very calming. https://youtube.com/@DrKimSage?si=I4UsdHF9AtueHxUe
* Dr. Fox is very practical, but sometimes his face bothers me, so I just listen to his stuff üòâ
https://youtube.com/@DrDanielFox?si=ZnsBzlcWyJcbg1Uk
(All of them have content on other platforms as well.)
* If you struggle with self-harm, this is an alternative list of things to try to avoid self harming, and it is a loooooong list. https://projectlets.org/alternatives-to-selfharm
* This bpd sub has been particularly supportive and validating, and I encourage you to ""let it out"" here.
* Therapy/new therapist if you have access. Same with psychiatrist if you have comorbid issues that require meds. 

Also, I understand people have reactions, but out of concern for your health, I just want to say that your partner's reaction to noticing that you ""messed with their 'stuff'"" is concerning to hear. I don't hear concern for you in ""now I can't even keep these here"" - however, I do hear them shaming you in what was relayed. (I do think it's better the weapons aren't in the house for some time but that's it's own thing)...AND It's no wonder you're having a ""reaction"" and probably having trouble regulating. Sometimes people don't realize they speak a certain way toward others, and sometimes ""we"" don't pick up on it b/c often we've been conditioned to accept ""less than."" I just thought, based on your post, it might be a useful conversation for you and your partner to have or revisit when you felt comfortable so that maybe the next bad situation doesn't go from bad to worse. üò¨ Shame and BPD don't generally mix well. 

I've struggled with mental health issues my whole life, been in therapy for 25 years - dozens of medication trials and various treatment modalities later I'm still sitting in a near constant state of wanting to die, too. I'm trying to figure it all out, too. I hope something in the list helps, and if not, at least we can suffer together. üñ§",LongMedia7072,17xi547

I can go to the store alone and shit like that but being straight ass alone....I don't handle it well. I do shit like compulsively pluck my eyebrows when I'm not using. So we want to be sober, healthy and independent, all the good progress you've made, it's still there, you accomplished things okay, you might be down playing it too a degree and focusing on only the negative. But, you are codependent like I am, and I took all obsessed with my fiance. We have a very healthy relationship tho, has boundaries and always checks in with me to keep me in the know. Like everything. Maybe if yours was willing to do that more and tell you ahead of time about things hes even considering doing you might take it better. Do you have a pet to cuddle? That might help. My therapist has said the best with this we can do is keep my self care at 110 percent. Like everything from diet, journaling, exercising, tooth care, sobriety, making my medications on time and shit like that, PLUS writing down a list of my accomplishments then adding to it daily. Things like taking a shower count okay. If you get the balls up to actually take a shower, brush your teeth and put on face cream.... That's an accomplishment bc if your like me you don't really feel like it. So knowing you can so more than you think, and it's tangibly down on paper like that's something you read, and touch and know it's real and that to me it's comforting.

1,"I'm going to cry:"") thank you so so much for taking time to write all of this! You helped me a lot to realise some things and confirm myself that writing is the best alternative to escape and express my feelings. I have to admit that I no longer go to therapy and it's been a whole year that I only do homeotherapy (so I don't talk regularly to someone I just take the medication and that's it). Mostly because I don't have the money to do both and I haven't found someone that we match or understands me yet. I know a pet would help me so much but I just can't be that responsible for another being. We have cats tho outside and I have a family dog I take it to the forest in my hometown and it really helps me being alone. I will definitely start writing more because I think that's one reason that  I felt fed up last night. I couldn't handle it all inside no more. I will check the therapists you told me thanks! thing is tho that I used to love being alone it helped me develop myself the past 4-5 years and quarantine helped me a lot but now I'm finding myself trying to attach to people as a coping mechanism which is bad. I used to love art and many things that I did by myself. It's just this dread that my bf will leave me but yeah as you said I don't show him how in need of him I truly am he doesn't understand this anyways.

0,"You're chasing a label. Labels can be helpful for you to understand your problem. They can be helpful for other people to understand your problem. However, the box that you've been placed in by someone else is just that - it's a box. It's never usually as simple as someone having one problem and everyone's experience of mental health is unique. No two people with a labelled disorder are the same. 

Have you heard the statement ""all models are wrong, some are useful""? Well it's very true in the case of the DSM categorisations of disorders. Nobody is 100% BPD and 0% NPD because they share some traits. Nobody is 0% autistic. The DSM is actually more of a sensemaking framework than a categorisation framework. So there's not necessarily a right or wrong answer as to which pigeonhole a person fits into, it's just a way to try and make sense of the situation and help decide what to do next. 

Also, bear in mind that in a way the label gives you validation that you're right. In many cases NPD/BPD people were starved of validation from carers (especially parents) as children and many of their behaviours seek an outcome of validation, often from authority figures. Consider the idea that you could be seeking the validation of psychiatrists when actually it's more important that you recognise which patterns of thought are unhealthy and develop healthy coping strategies to manage them.

If you're being blocked from receiving treatment and going through a hard time I'm sorry for that. It can be difficult to know where to start with treatment. There are a huge number of resources online for  you to get started with helping yourself. If you're interested I can share some links.

Today, I would say that it is wrong and insensitive to people with a BPD diagnosis for you to claim a diagnosis you have not been given. The fact is that you might experience a different PD like OCPD or PD-NOS, it's also possible the feelings you shared are more related to other factors completely.

What worked for me was trying to make it as not about sex as possible. I think being this way makes things feel like it is a lot more than what reality is. And that included sex for me.

I was just making very bad decisions... And as much as other people had their role and responsibility in it. I am responsible for choosing poorly and making bad decisions. Whether I have bpd or not.

1,"I have been told I can make someone feel like the best person in the world, but also the worst. :( I think the first step you can do is to identify what exactly are triggers to your borderline behaviors or tendencies.

Knowledge is something no one can take away from you. I am more valuable going to sleep than I was in the morning. Little attainable goals like that everyday become habits, those positive habits build confidence, and that has been able to help me be more independent and less codependent individual.

I don't have an answer for you ask I dumped my family in 2014 for what was supposed to be a temporary therapeutic time but turned into, phew am I ever glad you are all out of my life permanently time. I still talk to mom and she's probably the worst, but you know, you don't ditch your mom. Distance is key, you have to be nice which is super annoying, but good practice, and yeah I am not really going to provide great advice here, just that I fully identify with this. Don't take their bullshit is the number one, and feel free to disengage and do something you really enjoy instead of having horrible conversations on repeat or not getting the effort you put in back. Reward yourself for your own efforts, don't wait for validation because, and this is the worst reality ever, but it may not come.

My family doesn't know about my mental health, they're all pretty ignorant. I found it really best to just reduce contact with all of them- I mean, you don't have to fully cut them off (I did cut off my dad though, and it's been years and I still feel really solid in the decision, and he still sends me money and weird emails sometimes regardless of requests that he not, and I still have never changed my mind).  

I feel like those generations have romantic notions about family and it just doesn't mean the same thing to me at all- I mean keeping in mind that our parents like ""had"" to make up with their horrifically abusive parents for our sake, and (in my case anyway) even though that didn't make anything really better I just had to deal with a drunk dad *and* his drunk dad, they want that, they want the fiction, and resolution, and probably they do just love you too.  But, more likely they at least partially think you owe them something, which is kind of like love? really not.  I don't owe my family shit, and they aren't even the worst, I just don't. 

I started limiting the amount of contact I had with my family over many years and just stopped allowing their bullshit to impact me in my adult life (this is obviously impossible being in the same house and I am so sorry you have to I haven't done that for years and can't even imagine what it would be). This started with not talking to family about other family members (as in inter-familiar gossip), and then yeah it really was an i've had enough never again thing with my dad, and pretty much everyone disowned me for that so it made it pretty easy really. I don't know, every once and a while there is a random phone call and some backhanded comment and i'm like, you know, you are all just making a case for me never speaking to you again, bye.  I just stopped taking it.

Maybe that is just a major cop-out, but truly, my family has so much trauma, we could talk for literally decades and I don't think we'd ever work through it, nor do I even really want to. I truly just feel better and more emotionally stable when I don't have relationships and I don't know that that will ever be communicated to my family without a wall of shame thrown at me, but i'm just like that, it's fine, it's better. We can talk sometimes, you aren't all dead to me or anything, it's just, not the same it's a different kind of relationship we have now, one that I have a lot more agency over.  

I think, after many years, they finally got it and started being a lot nicer.  I think they realized that they literally would not have a relationship with me at all, and that this wasn't a symptom of me being young and irresponsible, it was a choice, a very difficult one, to divorce my family, and it really worked out for me. So things are a lot better, but had I stayed? Had I accepted that I would have to go to my aunt's house bi-annually bc it was too hard to stay in the city, or kept pandering to my dad's drinking and adult-baby bullshit? i'd still be doing it, I know it.  I'd be unhappy and co-dependent and the relationships I would have chosen outside of these unhealthy relationships would also be bad. So, if it is feeling impossible right now, it's likely because it is, and just take comfort in knowing that it will be over soon at least and you can work on those relationships from a distance soon.  


I took a lot of distance from most people I was close to when I was diagnosed BPD- I still don't fully understand why or how my relationships were disregular, and having no relationships (or many casual relationships which is more the case now) was an important part of figuring that out at least partially.  When I did this I went through relationship relapse and bounced around a lot of shit people for a while out of total boredom, but eventually it got old and the patterns were much more obvious and I did see how ridiculous I am sometimes.  I feel that had I not removed extraneous stress I would not have come to those realizations and probably would just have continued the abusive patterns that I learned growing up.    


I'm not saying don't waste your energy- people are worth your care, but I guess having different (lowered, almost none) expectations is a good approach? I feel like the changes in my relationships are pretty minimal actually, but I did some work to deal with how I process the things my family say to me, and THAT is a very difficult thing, and once that work is done, yeah it's easier.  I care less, I don't think about the past, I don't sweat the ""small things"" (they aren't small!!) bc I can't- it hurts, it hurts me too much, i'm maxed on hurt. I guess bc I had that long period of no contact, when the contact happened again it wasn't so intense. detraumatization can take a decade. Distance by choice not neglect is very empowering if you are, like me, a child of neglect. It's work that my dad never did or got to do, and that I remember also, it's not even really his fault you know? It's just also not my problem.    


Family, especially if your family are kind of assholes who never learned to behave, isn't always the most positive support system for ppl with bpd starting therapy.  Bc yeah, having them around is triggering as fuck. You are allowed to set firm limits and take your space to heal. Don't worry about mum, she'll be fine and she's there and she doesn't have to deal with having a mental illness right now, you do. 

If people ask what your deal is or enact anger or resentment, just state clearly ""yes, i'm sorry that I have been distant, I am taking some real time to focus on myself and improving my mental health. part of this is in relation to my relationships and I am finding it beneficial to have some distance from family members so that I can figure it all out.  I hope we can talk soon/again about this once I find the help I am seeking, I simply don't want to create conflict or damage our relationship in the process because it is important to me. Thank you for being patient, it may be a slow process and could take some time. Do you have other supports and people you can turn to about... so and so?... You know I am always here if you really need me, but right now it is important that I take space, thank you for respecting that.""  

They probably need space too. Sometimes engaging family members in a therapeutic exercise makes them understand your life and the work it takes to just function, and maybe also the differences in how you process things.  ""hey mom, I found this really cool new breathing or visualization technique, it only takes a couple of minutes, would you want to try it out with me?"" If they aren't responsive to this kind of effort (which, if you are like me and emotional regulation is almost impossible we know that is a loooot of effort) just run.  Disengage, take your space, just focus on you and make that your only focus for a while. It's not worth it, right now, to keep trying there. Set firm limits as to how much of your energy is going to the people around you and communicate them directly.   


It is different for everyone, but I found myself to be too vulnerable to be around anyone I knew following my diagnosis.  I changed cities, found places to be basically with other mentally ill people who were into leaving eachother alone, and was careful about who I interacted with and how, with many, many setbacks.  I just couldn't factor family into the equation at all, it was too necessary for me to get well, and I did, and my family was still there, just not so there that i'm in a trauma blackout whenever I think about them.   


Sorry for the essay, I hope that helps a bit anyway if only that I can relate.  I absolutely hate when people tell me to let shit go, without understanding that it is almost impossible for some people to do that, but I think for myself anyway it is less letting shit go and more not allowing myself to be re-traumatized and hurt by others' and this is a whole strategy that is more effective than just being like whatever, I don't care.  I always care, but it really only hurts me to care too much, caring less is good sometimes.",,kqnfuc
0,"ik its hard when youre in love, especially dealing with bpd in my case and possibly yours, but the only way for you to have a happy flourishing relationship is for you to want to improve for yourself. of course she can be apart of your motivation, however at the end of the day you must be willing to grow inside. Showing her you are improving everyday, not necessarily saying ‚Äúoh look at me! im not as emotional! im not so anxious!‚Äù, but putting effort into who you are consistently can put you at better standings with her. Best of luck ‚ô•Ô∏è",mommymerc,av2ci0
1,"This, actions will always speak louder than words, you were emotionally brutal to her and she knows you can't ever tell her you're a better person, you need to show her you're a better person. 

But also I admire you writing all of this and putting it on the table, it takes a lot to go deep into all your wrongdoings. So you're definitely making progress.

Also, don't try to get her 'back' as in back into a relationship, try to just be a damn good friend, someone she'll appreciate :) ",A_FABULOUS_PLUM,av2ci0
