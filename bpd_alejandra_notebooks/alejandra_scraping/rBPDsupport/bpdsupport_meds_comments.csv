I feel like there‚Äôs never really an end to the ups and downs. I‚Äôd say 50% is accurate enough with the right mindset. I‚Äôm sorry if my answer isn‚Äôt what you were hoping for.

0,"I‚Äôve at times been an anti-psychiatry type, but in my and many others experience, medication is beneficial. Stopping weed/nicotine sucks, my experience has been that quitting after using for a while has caused emotional turbulence. I believe my medication has lessened the lows and destructive behaviors for me.  But most importantly: talk to a doctor about your options. Like others said, exercise, good habits, etc., a lot of the stuff traditionally advised for depression and general improved health will help you over time. A doctor will also be able to get a better picture of your health than this forum can. Wishing you the best.",beingandbecoming,17nzkl3
1,"Honestly starting meds was the best decision I ever made! I‚Äôm on Seroquel and Lithium, but find what works for you. I started out on these and these just happen to work best. Now, I still struggle with my BPD symptoms like mood swings, but they at a level I can control. That‚Äôs the goal - Management. I used to struggle a lot of suicidal tendencies, impulsive behavior and such but again, these are now thoughts that I sometimes have, but am able to control due to my medication. The medication gives me time to react and think about my decisions before I act on them. Before? I used to act then figure what the hell I needed to do to clean up the mess I made lol. I mention my struggles because I want you to know medication isn‚Äôt an end all be all, but it is 100% something I recommend to everyone considering getting on them especially pairing meds with DPT and CBT. It‚Äôs very helpful in the recovery process.

If you need help paying for meds, I do too, look at using apps like blinkhealth, goodRX, Cost Plus drugs, and even CVS has a discount card for medication. These services provide discounted prices for prescription medications. I‚Äôve used all of them. 

Also, this is a bit of advice you didn‚Äôt ask for but from a person with BPD to another. Staying off of social media has given my life a whole new meaning. Like I find myself enjoying my life and not comparing myself to others or becoming obsessed with people etc. Also try reading the book atomic habits, I know cheesy, but I just started it and it‚Äôs helping me. Idk, but it‚Äôs something to consider! ü§ç",,17nzkl3

I‚Äôm not sure what you want to decide on for your journey but my psychiatrist told me that I should probably be on medication and antidepressants especially will help . I personally have major depression disorder as a diagnosis. But I do believe with the right medication can help the pain.

0,"Music takes a long time! don't stress. seriously there are technologies I spent 7-10 years learning and I still forget stuff.  It can be really helpful to hang out with other musicians and get off the internet- youtube is not my favourite way to learn for the reasons you stated.  

The way I deal with the creative stress is to be kind of scheduled, so that it fits in with your life (it's pretty hard to do music and school in my opinion, but sometimes it works.  I feel like you can always keep a little practice going somewhere- and I find mobile apps can be nice for this, I like this one called sunvox which is free on android.) 

This is how I do it: I jam on my instruments after work or school on monday/tues.  W/Th I make sure my work stations stay clean, but I don't usually get a hand on it.  Friday night I do my correspondence or computer work as that is the only time I find enough quiet usually to do production.  Sunday I back up files.  

This is nice because there isn't any catching up.  If you miss a monday, well there's tuesday. If you miss both, well I guess you don't get to jam this week, which is sad but you'll want to even more next week. If you don't backup one week, you can do it next week, and if you feel like going out on friday night, well fine.   Hey, every once and a while your desk might already be clean on wednesday and you might feel extra inspired!    


Focus is hard for me, so the separation of tasks really helps and is less overwhelming.   


Seriously, for everyone, it takes a really long time to learn.

0,"Hey.
I‚Äôll start by saying that it‚Äôs good you‚Äôre setting boundaries and receiving continuous professional support. I would stick to what your therapist suggests rather than what your partner has said concerning medication etc. I can confirm that there aren‚Äôt really many medications than can help with a BPD mind. People often equate it to something like anxiety or depression (as these are common symptoms for us and can be treated with meds) But if anything, I think BPD is more akin to something like being on the spectrum. It‚Äôs more just that our brains are wired differently at a core level. I usually find explaining it this way to those who don‚Äôt understand BPD helps a bit more. 
It does sound like your partner has some problematic behaviours, and it‚Äôs worth taking the time to think about whether they‚Äôre open to working through them, and whether you‚Äôre up for standing by them whilst they do. Outburst of anger are a big no for me, but you may be someone who handles that stuff well.  We can‚Äôt really tell you whether you should end it or not, that‚Äôs down to you. I guess it‚Äôs all about balance and protecting your peace. If they‚Äôre making you feel worse, then it may not be worth continuing the relationship x",Accomplished_Funny51,190iwrf

I don't have any magic solutions, but here are some things that helped me at different times that could be helpful to look into, or hopefully even just distract you for a little while:
* Patrick Teahan is personally my favorite and has the most content. https://youtube.com/@patrickteahanlicswtherapy?si=xyLPH_H-FwQh8ZJS
* Dr. Kim Sage is very calming. https://youtube.com/@DrKimSage?si=I4UsdHF9AtueHxUe
* Dr. Fox is very practical, but sometimes his face bothers me, so I just listen to his stuff üòâ
https://youtube.com/@DrDanielFox?si=ZnsBzlcWyJcbg1Uk
(All of them have content on other platforms as well.)
* If you struggle with self-harm, this is an alternative list of things to try to avoid self harming, and it is a loooooong list. https://projectlets.org/alternatives-to-selfharm
* This bpd sub has been particularly supportive and validating, and I encourage you to ""let it out"" here.
* Therapy/new therapist if you have access. Same with psychiatrist if you have comorbid issues that require meds. 

Also, I understand people have reactions, but out of concern for your health, I just want to say that your partner's reaction to noticing that you ""messed with their 'stuff'"" is concerning to hear. I don't hear concern for you in ""now I can't even keep these here"" - however, I do hear them shaming you in what was relayed. (I do think it's better the weapons aren't in the house for some time but that's it's own thing)...AND It's no wonder you're having a ""reaction"" and probably having trouble regulating. Sometimes people don't realize they speak a certain way toward others, and sometimes ""we"" don't pick up on it b/c often we've been conditioned to accept ""less than."" I just thought, based on your post, it might be a useful conversation for you and your partner to have or revisit when you felt comfortable so that maybe the next bad situation doesn't go from bad to worse. üò¨ Shame and BPD don't generally mix well. 

I've struggled with mental health issues my whole life, been in therapy for 25 years - dozens of medication trials and various treatment modalities later I'm still sitting in a near constant state of wanting to die, too.

It's like waking up out of a dream. It's like something else had control of you. And yes it does sound like she split on you, despite her being calm but still quite upset, splits don't always happen during what I call ""rage episodes"" or ""depressive episodes"" I would just give her some space to clear her head and see how things are in a few days.",Topic-Economy,1ciu9kt

0,"Hey OP! I know this struggle so well, and you are definitely not alone.

Something that helped in my circumstances was a couple of things:

1. Knowing I had BPD and learning about it; knowing a lot about why I‚Äôve done what I‚Äôve done (basically that ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment)
2. Coming to understand that obsessively friending, then unfriending, or sending a message and then deleting the message or following up with my thoughts one after the other in multiple messages after initial message and the like, is‚Äìhow I see it‚Äì something of a subform of *splitting*
3. Choosing and learning to believe people when they say this or that about you (positives only; but taking less than positive things is a diff convo)
4. Identifying the feelings you get in the moment when you do those things, naming it and reflecting on the why. What‚Äôs triggering that response? When it happens, write it down (eg, ‚Äútoday I friended Elly again, then unfriended her. At this moment I was feeling anxiety because‚Ä¶ and then delve into that further). This sometimes helped with my spirals
5. When you see the pattern and the triggers, it was then about processing after that and then learning to catch myself before I deleted a message or sent additional texts or unfriended
6. Always, always, always remember that practice and learning better habits is NOT linear! Give yourself grace if it‚Äôs not something you‚Äôre able to catch every time
7. Realizing that part of my personal trigger for this was obsessing about the ‚Äúam I being annoying, do they like me, etc‚Äù and that by hyper focusing on that made me super twitchy and to get rid of that anxiety I decided to ‚Äúun-do it‚Äù. I began practicing the ‚ÄúI friended them/ sent that message, now I‚Äôm going to focus on something else, and if it‚Äôs important enough, or they specifically ask me to, I will leave it alone.‚Äù The urge began to stick after a while. To this day, I still wonder if I‚Äôm being annoying or if someone doesn‚Äôt like me but it‚Äôs manageable most of the time now. But then that leads to:
8. Wherein you can‚Äôt control what other people think of you, but you can control how you put yourself out there with your actions and decisions.

OP, you‚Äôve noticed this is something you do that you don‚Äôt find helpful or healthy, and you mentioned your loved ones are or seem to be getting annoyed by the consistent back and forth, right? Don‚Äôt let that destroy you! You‚Äôve taken a great step by even having the reflection that this is not how you want to keep behaving and then reaching out.

There‚Äôs no quick fix to BPD, there‚Äôs either remaining stagnant and drowning in it, or taking the process of overcoming certain aspects one step at a time and making progress down the path you want to walk.

I know you mentioned that you aren‚Äôt comfortable sharing your diagnosis with your loved ones, but perhaps in the future that will change. And I really think it could potentially help, and them; them, so that they can understand it‚Äôs not just you being annoying or too much on purpose, but that there‚Äôs an actual reason for it and you‚Äôre actively working on making it better because you care for them and (I hope more importantly) about yourself. And it‚Äôd potentially help you because when a person takes ownership of things like this, you‚Äôre giving yourself the power over how you feel, and taking it away from others (or at least how we perceive that).

Off topic example of owning it to keep the power in your hands: I had the crown/tooth next to my front tooth fall out and it‚Äôs unrepairable. I could get an implant but that will be hella expensive and around a year plus long wait. I am super self conscious about my teeth as is since I didn‚Äôt take care of them in childhood and it‚Äôs haunting my ass now. But I figured, ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll just wear a mask everywhere‚Äù. I hated that. So this last Tuesday when I went to campus for class I was wearing a mask and made a decision for myself. (Helps if there‚Äôs one person you feel a semblance of safety with at first when practicing this; it doesn‚Äôt have to be your FP or BFF 5eva). I spoke up right before class began (like a minute or seconds before), and started off with a little joke announcement ‚ÄúSo I know we‚Äôre all judgment free in this class, except when it comes to Professor A‚Äôs dad jokes (insert snorts of laughter) but I wanted to sort of tell you all this‚Äù, and proceeded to basically say ‚ÄúMy tooth fell out, I‚Äôm not sick (as I took off my mask) and I don‚Äôt want to wear this mask so here‚Äôs my adorable smile minus one teephers‚Äù. And I actually showed the class while sitting all chill-like in my seat. I further added, ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs weird I‚Äôm announcing this but I‚Äôm doing it because it gives me the power to own it on my terms since I can be self conscious about it, so there you have it!‚Äù Lots of nods and ‚Äúthat‚Äôs awesome‚Äôs‚Äù and ‚ÄúI love that!‚Äù were the responses.

And wow that‚Äôs long. Anyway:

**Tl;dr** OP has made a significant step by 1) taking note of this behavior and wanting to change it as well as 2) seeking support in my opinion.

0,"Hi! I'm new here too and also new to reddit in general. So I hope I'm not doing something wrong with this reply but I'd like to give advice as someone who was diagnosed around 2 years ago. (F20) 
 For starters, theres lots of stigma around this disorder. I've been through residential, iop, and php, (if you dont know these are inpatient/outpatient treatment centers, or what's considered ""rehab,"" where you live there and go to group everyday, possibly with Sundays off, for 3-6 hours a day. You stay in these facilities on average for 1 month) and even the professionals there can get nasty even upon hearing the diagnosis. (Ex. I was already diagnosed before entering, and each facility immediately refused my diagnosis, and then were disgusted after doing assessments/noticing symptoms and behaviors) With that being said, it's going to hurt while you're doing research and you come across people who make us out to be monsters. I still encourage you to do a lot of research. I would encourage most people to do some form of treatment. (I understand that money can be an issue I owe 7k to treatment centers even with my good insurance.) One thing I did when I was first diagnosed was I bought the DBT skills workbook. Professionals will say meds are only half the battle. For me, they are none of the battle because I was on 20+ different ones during treatment and I just don't currently feel like that's my way of going about it. Also important: Bpd CAN go in remission. I notice people acting like their bpd will be crisis level forever. It really doesn't have to be that way. I'm not completely better by any means, but I've for sure improved since I found out I had it. This is starting to get long so lmk if I can help anymore!

It‚Äôs easy to have regrets when someone is gone and to justify/look over the bad things about them when they‚Äôre not here anymore because you‚Äôre not actively dealing with them anymore. You have no reason to feel guilty though. You needed space from her for your own mental health. Never feel bad about putting your metal health first and staying away from people who make it worse. 

Try thinking of it in a physical way if that helps. If you had an open wound, and every time you were around your mother she took a knife and stuck it in that wound, would you honestly feel guilty about staying away from her? Would you honestly let her trick you into believing that it‚Äôs your fault that you didn‚Äôt get to spend a lot of time with her? Or would you put the blame on her for sticking the knife in every time?

0,"Hi I‚Äôm 37 and have been living with BPD most of my life. Properly diagnosed when I was 24. First off, people with BPD can absolutely be good even amazing partners. We just have to work extra hard on our end to stay constantly aware of ourselves and how we perceive whatever current situation we are facing that is triggering us. The best possible skill you can learn is respect boundaries both your own and the boundaries of others. For us, a lot of it comes down to communication. How we convey and receive to and from our loved ones. We have to work extra hard to remind ourselves that we need to trust and know our partners love us. And on their end they have to also be willing to stay healthy and regulated as well as taking part in either personal or group therapy. The truth is‚Ä¶ we are a tall order. But we also, have the innate skill to love‚Ä¶ if we remind ourselves why we are doing this, it‚Äôs all out of love.
I myself am entrenched in a battle that is slowly degrading my partners will to keep going. 
I‚Äôve decided to take space after a big blow up. 
(This included splitting, devaluing, and the eventual ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù talk) and I‚Äôve been doing my best to calm myself physically and mentally while I let the emotions run it‚Äôs course. Im trying to be more observant rather than reactive. But I know deep down somewhere‚Ä¶ im losing someone I truly love and care about‚Ä¶ I honestly would not have revisited this BPD if it wasn‚Äôt for her.

That said, these two approaches can be practiced concurrently. For example, one of the most used introduction to meditation is to focus on your breath as it naturally comes and when your mind wanderd, then gently return tour focus to breathing. But this in fact clears the mind. In the beginning of my practice, I found this to be a good approach and still do. 

Just be gentle. Thoughts will come, it is difficult to think of nothing. When they come, just let them. Equally, when they come, let them go too.",Hour_Tomatillo8730,176jwcc
5,"What I said. 

Meditation is (in principle) simple: You just have to sit. 

Normally, we have trouble to be still. We grasp onto thoughts that come; into ideas avout what we should be doing (be it while meditating or in our lives in general); what will come next, what happened yesterday etc. Thus, we have open the proverbial ""hand of thought"" that grasps onto these things, fo let them go. This will enable these things to beas they are in themselves, not as the images we try to make them into.

Saying that zazen, or meditation, is good for nothing is a warning. Ultimately, meditation is not done for some goal but for its own sake. Paradoxically, only then can meditation be benificial.

I spent the next 2 years in and out of out-patient facilities, and what helped me the most was mood-stabilizers to combat the highs and lows, and Dialectical Behavior Therapy to change the way I approached my interpersonal relationships.

0,"I don't have BPD (but do have some Cluster B attributes) but am dealing with someone with BPD who see's me as their FP. If you don't want to lose your FP, please do all that you can to give him some breathing room.  I recently set some boundaries about not wanting to chat as much and brought up the issue of one-sided conversations, which led to a major blowout and threats of blocking. I recently came close to taking up their offer to cut ties forever only to be roped back in. I'm telling you, this is very exhausting and the more this cycle continues, the more I personally feel like a worthless person who must bend to her will and live up to her distorted perception of me. I'm often second guessing how I act and feel like I have to be extra cautious, lest I step on another landmine. I often wonder if it's worth all the sacrifice and emotional turmoil.

Does your FP know about your BPD? I've put up with all this so far because I empathize with how tough it is to have this disorder and don't want to be one of numerous people who've abandoned her or like the many who've abandoned me. If you truly love your FP and don't want to drive him away, you absolutely need to be willing to see things from his perspective and understand that he can't be there for you all the time and must be willing to compromise.  I wish my friend w/ BPD would be more open to having forthcoming discussions about our friendship. Although she's willing to talk about the many conflicts she has with other people at great lengths and detail, she fears discussion of conflict between us and would rather be super passive aggressive or use the nuclear option of threats of cutting ties forever.  Try to be as open as you can with him and allow him to be open with you without blowing up. Set firm boundaries with each other that allow both of you to see eye-to-eye and respect each other. I know that's much easier said than done, but try to always keep in mind how your FP must feel during the blowups and how it could cause him distance himself form you. He must also be willing to also understand where you are coming from and cut you a degree of slack if you cut some slack for him.   


Oh, and look up love languages if you haven't already. People show their love in different ways. Just because he doesn't express it the way you do, doesn't necessarily mean he love you any less.

 When you say, ""he has other friends, clearly you are not enough, so just ghost him and isolate‚Äù, you are assuming he will reject you once he gets to know you. Perhaps he will. Perhaps he won't.
What is the best case scenario? 
He is completely interested in you only and wants to only spend time with you every second of the day but he has these pesky other people who talk to him and it's hard to keep them away. He even started using bug spray on them. He has different fly swatters that are color coded for each friend and he slaps them with those when he can't find the spray. 

You see, that's quite silly. But isn't your  worse case scenario too much? I think so.

0,"I don't know that either of these 2 points will bring you real comfort but

People with borderline have had physician assisted deaths in countries where that is offered. May be no surprise.

Second is that DBT is designed to recognize that life is not always ""worth living"", and feeling as you described may be a life that's not ""worth living"" (why else would you be desperate for escape?). One point is to focus on that reality and risk , managing to cope with new tools while building the relationships, meaning and habits that can sustain a life you chose.

I can't say why your psych tells you ""you're doing well"", whether it's communication on your part, or perhaps just the limit of their validation and awareness. The fact you were previously on 5 medications at once is a small concern and maybe suggests that wasn't right care for you; in general fewer meds= better recovery for pwBPD. I can't assume you have access to other care providers or treatment programs, but possibly a higher level of care, partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient would fit; or a different treatment approach would be a better match for you. You find the group setting increases your anxiety and emotional avoidance or dissociation?

As you said, suicide hurts others, it's a painful grief, and still it's an outcome and a choice. And while you're here not choosing to die, perhaps a different team or treatment will eventually click. Do you make art or journal?",TranZeitgeist,i2asxt
1,"I feel you. I'm in a extremely bad place right now, things and situations are eating me alive from inside out, I can't control my horrible thoughts and paranoia, it's hurting a lot and it feels like I'm broken and empty and never going to recover. I know I've been there before and recover but every time this comes back it seems impossible and hurt even more, I don't want to live in this cycle. I can't eat properly, I can't think, I can't do things that I like, and don't know how much time it's gonna take. 
The only reason I don't kill myself right now is because my family will not ever recover, I don't even consider the possible happy and joyful things I could live if I didn't kill myself.
So, I feel you, that's all fucked up, it's too much for a person to endure, wish I could take this from me and from you.

3,"Hi, Thank you for your thoughtful reply. 

I think my psychiatrist thinks I'm doing well compared to how I am when I'm admitted as an inpatient. I'm not sure that's a very fair benchmark though. I feel like she thinks my current level of suffering is acceptable because it's presenting as an improvement on where I was before. But it's always going up and down and honestly, even with the few moments where my mood is at its best, it's still not worth the remaining 99% of the time which seems to range from extremely difficult to absolutely unbearable.

I wasn't able to leave the house, but now I can sometimes with immense distress and difficulty. I'm still having crazy mood swings that I can barely manage. Just because I'm not aggressively trying to kill myself all the time and dont require constant surveillance doesn't mean I'm doing better enough to be left without help. She's refusing to prescribe any more medications because of the bad reactions I've had but honestly I would try anything at this point, even more bad drug reactions if it meant that this was not the level of normal I would be settling with for the rest of my life. I just feel like as long as I'm not immediately going to kill myself, that seems to be good enough, which seems cruel and disappointing. As things are, I don't know how much longer I can survive like this. 

I cycle through these suicidal loops so often that when I come out, I know I didn't really want to die, I just wanted to know that there was a possibility of a way out. This hope is difficult to hold on to when you're constantly told to just go to therapy when it's clearly not addressing your current level of distress at all.",sarahthehumanperson,i2asxt
4,"Hi there, 
I don't want to say the cliched line 'I'm sorry you're going through that' which seems to be the standard automated response to someone sharing their pain, because it never makes me feel any better. I'll just say thank you for validating my experience and sharing yours. Sometimes things just suck and there's not a lot we can do about it. We don't need to be going through the exact same thing but just being able to be honest about how terrible things are and meeting in the middle through our mutual suffering is enough. I don't want to minimise how unique your situation is, but I will say that I definitely share a sense that I'm living purely out of obligation to my family and also that it feels pretty much impossible for me to feel any positive emotions, enjoy anything or relax completely without self-judgment, fear or paranoia setting in. I'm very inconsistent because of my moods (and I avoid interaction if I'm acutely anxious, depressed or angry), but would be happy to chat to someone with shared experience. Most people feel really overwhelmed by the weight of all this stuff.",sarahthehumanperson,i2asxt

6,"thank you so much for your kind words. yeah, we definitely don't need to be facing the exact sames things to validate the struggles and feelings of others. it's 'comforting' in a certain way to know that you're not alone at all and is not the only human ever to experience this kind of pain, it's too much to handle.
hope you feel better in the next days <3",lun44tic,i2asxt

3,"Idk if you'll see this cus this post is old but hopefully you do. Thank you so much for sharing, I feel a lot less alone from reading your life story. It's crazy how similar you are to me, minus the Christian background and not being accepted by your parents. I'm a lesbian but my parents told me before I ever even knew what being gay was that I would be accepted and my parents had no religious affiliations. But a lot of what you described growing up and how your felt is how I felt. I haven't had any drug problems or weight problems but I think it's mostly because my mom and all her brothers had drug addictions so I've always been really careful with that. But I have put myself in debt over $20,000 twice with my shopping addiction. I've also been asked a lot if I've ever been sexually abused but don't have any memory of anything. I'm sure I have BPD but I haven't been diagnosed. I've been misdiagnosed bi polar also but always knew that was wrong because my mood swings are caused by outer circumstances not chemical imbalance and because my sister is bi polar so I've seen manic episodes and I don't have those. My new therapist doesn't believe in diagnosis so I don't have any diagnosis she's just working on each thing I want to work on one at a time. Idk if that's going to be effective though or if you need a diagnosis to actually make progress with this? Any ways it's crazy how similar I felt like we are from reading your life story so thank you so much for making me feel less alone and crazy‚ù§Ô∏è",,gi1w9f

1,"Wow thank you for being so understanding. I didn't expect such a lovely response it's much appreciated.  
I'm trying to keep busy and structured but so hard as out of work. I work in a primary school so a key worker but been off for a couple weeks due to Easter and the rota we are using. 

I'm trying desperately to reach out to my loved ones but it's so hard. My best friend was my literal crutch for everything like this in my life so now without them it's like learning to walk again and I'm lost.

I weaned myself off my meds 2 years ago and have since attempted to OD so they were reluctant to prescribe me but on the other side of DBT and therapy it could be helpful to go back on medication. I'm hoping they will do a phone consultation as I'm trying to shield my father who I'm currently living with.

0,"I dont have the same experiences as you, but I hope I can help somehow.

I'd try distractions, since sleeping and eating aren't working right now. Start with like videogames, and work yourself down to more relaxing things, like idk watching tv. (This is not clinical advice btw, this is just what I hope may help, simple activities that don't require much thought but can still get you engrossed and get that mental flow going)

You'll be ok man. The person you left did NOT deserve you. You'll find a nice person. Me and my SO have been together for 3 years, and we've figured out a decent way to balance out my emotional swings with our relationship. 

If you can, drink something. Not alchohol, like, juice, or water, or soda even (tho prolly not that b/c that might cause caffine induced mood spikes, so decaffinated if you really want that). I think drinking smth would help your body feel better, since not eating/sleeping is making your moods snowball into each other. (My thearpist always advises me to care for my body, so that my moods are more stable, but that's hard to do when you're in the middle of a breakdown b/c your mind like, wants to sabatoge itself. Gotta love bpd. the only solution is to wind down, then take care of yourself to keep yourself wound down)

A good habit might be to just eat something tiny when upset. Like i dunno, some crackers. Just a couple. Try and make this just a Thing you Do when upset, a light snack, if that's ok for your health of course. This will help your body chill out, it certainly helps me. Kinda gives me a nice little soft reset.

Rest up man. I'm sorry you're upset :C It WILL be ok. A good thing about these quick moodswings is that they ARE quick, and will last just a week at most. you'll feel better soon. If you dont FEED an emotion, it naturally passes through in about 8 minutes. (more therapist facts!) So that's cool. 'course letting an emotion pass is super hard with emotional impulsivity but it's a good goal to get to!

Thanks for your time man. Please stay safe!!",,4nw2yt

0,"I'm bipolar with bits of BPD.  I've been medicated for the bipolar for over a decade but recently switched my meds up a bit and it seems to be helping with some of the BPD. I also did weekly therapy for two years that helped and made a mental list of ways to handle intense emotions. Some things that I've found help are running, writing, painting and watching TV. Also, allowing myself to have emotions and knowing that they will pass is incredibly helpful. Romantic relationships are problematic for me and I can't see myself being in a functional one right now. However, I feel like I am getting better about feeling abandoned which is good. I'm starting DBT soon (just got off the wait list) so hopefully that will help.

tl;dr meds help some, therapy helped me a lot and finding an outlet helps.",sillygoosegirl,3szkhu
1,"I'm BPD with Bipolar II-though I'm not quite sold on that second diagnosis yet. The DBT waiting lists around here are all 2+ years, and I definitely don't have the money for private therapy. What I've found the most helpful is 1-being single. Which sucks! I've been a chronic 'serial-reltionship(ist)' for my whole life, and it always stood in the way of getting better. Being single allows me to go through the wild ups and downs without taking it out on anyone, and without the guilt that causes. 2. I'm currenlty on 900mg Lithium and 300mg Wellbutrin, with 1 mg Lorazepam as needed. It took awhile for my psychologist and I to find the right meds and doses that work for me. And lastly 3. I've done so much research on BPD I could start my own library. I've got most of the books on the topic, have seen every documentary, have done all the DBT self help workbooks, and have even taken a 'loving kindness' course at a Zen Buddhist centre, as Zen Buddhism is a big part of DBT. With all that said, it still isn't easy-but it is easier than it used to be. I think for myself, I'll always 'backtrack' a bit when I'm in a relationship, it is a disorder of emotions and emotional connection.",jagersthebomb,3szkhu

0,"Everyone's bpd comes out in different ways. There's quiet bpd, people who have bpd from trauma(+genetics?) versus people who have it via only genetics,  people who react more to different emotions(ex. Hotheadnesses versus someone Cries a lot or someone with a mix of emotion based traits) than others, people who have a vice vs people who self harm versus people who do both, people who physically versus mentally self harm, etc etc. it can be very complicated but there are plenty of things most of us have in common. 
I'd recommend joining a community (which is basically what you're doing rn, this is a community, welcome :D ) and just checking out what other people say about their own issues, especially if they're alike to your own. 
I wouldn't recommend open forums about bpd (that include people who aren't bpd) because too often I personally find them crowded with misinformed prejudice that can be very hurtful.
The nice thing about bpd is that the bad parts of it are extremely treatable, especially via DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) and group therapy. You can also take meds for it, but there's no one medication for someone with bpd, so often people have different and unique assortments of medication that work for them, and some don't use meds at all.
Also, I haven't read too much about it so I'll let you do your own research, but ""complex PTSD"" may or may not be a related condition that could lend insight into bpd.
