0,Feel myself returning to old thoughts and spirals - looking for hope & support,"I am falling back down the rabbit hole and I just feel dejected. I ended up crying and losing control over thoughts multiple times this week and it's scary. I've been in this spiral before and got better with ketamine, but here we are again and that feels shitty. Scared that this pattern will continue the rest of my life and it will just be too much for me.

I just started an IOP and am seeking help, but I still feel really bad and alone.",1705072870.0,False,6,3,hurrahurricane,None,194xjvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/194xjvx/feel_myself_returning_to_old_thoughts_and_spirals/
1,No where to turn,"
No one needs to comment or read. I don't know where to type or go. 

My SO of 6 years told me to turn to reddit to ""vent"" instead of SM or friends. So I did. He wasn't happy with that. I have therapy 1 hour once a week. No one really knows how dark my mind is, even when I was ""venting"" in general.  We both have bad trust issues, we came out of bad marriages, we have done things to each other we regret. 
He's been reading things online and books that he knows are bad, but is sure I'm a typical BPD horrible person now. At first he didnt , i thought he knew better. We feel 10x more than neurotypical people, so sure, we react different than them.
This past month+  has been more than horrible. My dad passed when we weren't really expecting it (my mom passed in 2017 as well, that was truly unexpected). His dad passed in October which is bringing up emotions from that. He confessed something about 1.5 weeks ago and I'm trying to process that as well and I feel shattered from that too. I have a lot of emotions going on. It's like he thinks I should be over everything by now and be just fine. I'm TRYING to hold it together and I can't. I'm lucky to be alive if we're being honest. My depression is at an all time high, I'm anxiety predominant so this is odd for me. Yes. I've seen psych 2 weeks in a row emergent and will next week again for my regular visit which will male 3 weeks in a row (not including therapy.) 

It's constant tit-for-tat. Who can get who worse. He's no better than me but he seems to think he is bc he doesn't have the horrible bpd diagnosis.
 
At the same time there's so much good found in him and we can be amazing together. When it's good, it's great. He's the best to my kids. He treats me like a princess. He saw my dad the day before he went into the hospital when he went to get stuff from my brother and dad and dad and my SO talked abt marriage. He spent time at the hospital with him when I couldn't. He was with us when he took his last breath. It means so much to me. I cannot imagine life without him. 
My chest has been hurting since he made his confession. Not normal costochondritis muscle pain. I can't take another heartbreak. My marriage wasn't a heartbreak, that was a good riddance. This. I won't survive. I already feel it. 

With his dad, i helped make his transition as easy as i could on his family even it was just by being there (it was a long, heartbreaking decline.) I was strong for him until his dads funeral. My dad wasn't the best (I reminded him too much of my mom, so our relationship was strained, and other factors including his lady friend til they broke up) so his dad was a great father figure to me. I cherished every moment with his dad even more. 

 No relationship is flawless. I saw my parents go thru hell and swore they were going to divorce but they got thru whatever it was. We know we love eachother. 

He just started iop this week on his own and honestly I'm nervous bc I've been inpatient 7 times, in IOP for a while. I hear how they talk about bpd and know they're going to tell him to leave me fast especially when he tells them what's going on. I'm sure he's going to not tell them what he's done. It's human nature to save face. WHY is the person with bpd acting so erratic? There's a reason. 
He needs therapy for sure. Group therapy is just nerve wrecking with his situation overall (I don't want to tell all of his business.)

We're going to start couples therapy as well, if he still wants to do it. It would be nice if my therapist did couples but gotta be married. Idk when we can do it btwn everything going on. 

I wish I didn't feel. I wish I didn't care. 

I'm terrified. I can't leave my kids. I already tried once and nearly succeeded. 

I also KNOW he's reading this. So hey there. ",1714251087.0,False,2,1,erinc2005,None,1ceon7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ceon7f/no_where_to_turn/
2,I’m new here,"My most recent psych doctor suggested I have BPD, and it honestly lines up with my symptoms. I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around it. I’ve always had the extreme mood changes, and the thing where if someone does something “against” me, I will think of them like an enemy, if that makes sense. I had pretty significant trauma in my childhood and I’ve heard that’s common for this diagnosis. I’m also in recovery from alcoholism and an eating disorder. One good thing about it, is that I switched to DBT in therapy which I like, and have tried new meds like a mood stabilizer in addition to an SSRI, which never worked alone. I’m not as suicidal, like I was for awhile. So there’s progress. I just, I have this overlaying feeling that to my core, I am damaged/broken/unworthy. Like there is something wrong with me. It gets worse when I have to interact with other people, and I feel so awkward and overthink everything. But when I don’t interact with other people, I isolate and the obsessive thoughts of unworthiness gets worse. I’m ranting, I know. I’ve never posted here or really talked to anyone about this besides my therapist. I guess I’m looking for support? Tools? Connection? This shits hard.

3,Just got diagnosed.,"Hey guys. (Sorry for confusion I’m new here:))
I (24F) am in DBT outpatient treatment. Just finished 3 weeks of the PHP program. And now on IOP. Which is just 3 days a week for 3 hours a day. The PHP program was 9am-3pm Monday through Friday which I felt like I had a purpose and I was doing something. 
Anyways I guess what I need to let you all know is I was diagnosed with GAD and MDD when I was 16-17 after that went down a slippery slope of drugs (literally all of them) until I did acid at 20... and  thought I lost my freaking MIND lol (funny because having bpd you feel that way anyways) 
I always knew I was “off” or something. 
Fast forward 2 and a half years I was sober and fine.. so I thought. 
Here came the panic attacks, depression. Angry outbursts, quitting jobs, threatening to hurt myself. 
I knew I needed help or I was gonna go right back down the same bad road.
I found an (ACT) therapist that I’ve been seeing every Monday give or take for almost 2 years.. I think . I’ve also held down a job for a little over a year. At this job I had a breakdown that sent me to the doctors and that’s how I made it to the treatment center. I said all this to say now I’ve been diagnosed with BPD. .. idk what to do with that. 
Idk who that is but that’s not me. 
I have a loving boyfriend that doesn’t deserve to deal with all these emotions. 
Any advice?",1697112867.0,False,1,0,Maleficent-Click2,None,1765j67,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1765j67/just_got_diagnosed/
4,Sponsors?,"Hello, I have just started a partial hospitalization program and am taking my recovery from BPD more seriously. A friend, who is in 12 step, recommended I find someone like a sponsor for my journey and I think this is a great idea.

The biggest difficulty for me is that I do not have a space to meet potential sponsors. As with most PHP groups, we are not allowed to contact each other outside of group until we're both discharged. So, I have come to reddit. I was thinking perhaps this could be a thread to match each other, if we feel comfortable.

If you think you'd be a good match for me feel free to send a DM. If you don't think so, that's okay, and  I welcome you to post what you're looking for!

&#x200B;

For myself, I live in Seattle and would love to find someone local. I understand we're currently all at home for COVID, so I am happy to start virtually but I'd love to find someone who I could perhaps get coffee with sometimes, but this is not required. It is very important to me to find someone who is also professionally diagnosed and in treatment, especially if you are doing or have ever done PHP or IOP. At this point, I'd say my BPD is moderately managed and I am looking for support with someone who is also somewhat managed. My goal is remission, I hope yours is too!

Because this is a possible tigger I want to say that I am active in ageplay. If you are triggered by ageplay, dd/lg type dynamics, I will probably not be a good fit for you.",1586276492.0,False,2,1,xoxoaspey,None,fwne8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/fwne8a/sponsors/
