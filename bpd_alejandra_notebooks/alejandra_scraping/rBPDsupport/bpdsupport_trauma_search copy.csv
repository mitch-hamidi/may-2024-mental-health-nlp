0,bpd spiral after old trauma reminder?,"ok to start off i've never really posted on reddit let alone posted about something so personal but right now i feel desperate and so helpless. i don't know what else to do other than reach out to others that have felt similarly or been in similar situations. i (18f) have not been diagnosed with bpd officially but have talked about it with multiple therapists/psychiatrists before age 18. where i live, they do not diagnose people under the age of 18 with mental illness other than depression&anxiety at most of the mental health facilities. i struggled from age 11 til now trying to find an answer of jus ""what's wrong wit me"".  even now it's like all signs point to the diagnosis and discussing coping mechanisms but it's always, ""it could be something else tho"" i was always told that because i was so young, n because i was a girl that it could basically be anything from simply jus depression to ""over exaggerated hormones"" but always leaving wit the same question n no answers. i recently got into a serious relationship w my partner not even 2 years ago. and i sometimes wonder how he even still sticks around. then i wonder when he'll finally jus get tired of it n it already seems like he is. i feel so difficult. i feel annoying. an it feels like i have no control over any of it. like as soon as i get a little tiny grip of my emotions i completely lose my grasp on how to cope mentally to jus function thru the day. im a regular ass mexican female in a regular ass mexican family that will never truly understand how deep mental illness goes. i want love and understanding. i jus want someone to feel as compassionate about me as i feel about them but then i remember, i always feel i don't deserve it. i feel unworthy of it. my emotions feel so intense that i almost jus can't handle it i miss being numb to shit most the time. i don't know who to go to anymore or where to turn n i don't want to resort back to old ways of feeling better. i was doing so much better. then old triggers from the past bring back everything x100.",1699725360.0,False,6,1,analisyag,None,17szsas,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/17szsas/bpd_spiral_after_old_trauma_reminder/

2,Trauma Dream,"So I'm sure most of you know BPD and trauma are linked. I have PTSD from a number of things throughout my life, and as a consequence I get nightmares. They're always awful, my body somehow manages to make me actually feel pain during them, and they always play out in the same dark and smoky cinematic way. 

Last night I had one, but this one was new. Long story short I had a dream I had a mental breakdown, impulsively cheated on my fiance and then killed myself by hurling myself repeatedly into a brick wall in my office. 

I woke up in tears, yelling and shaking. My head hurt and I felt like I was going to vomit. That all to familiar ""I am a monster and need to hide my mental illness"" fear came up and I was so racked with guilt. 

The thing is my mental health hasn't been bad perse. I have BPD so its never great, but it wasn't awful. 

I have been so stoic all day, I feel like I might start disassociating at any moment, and my guilt is eating me alive. Cheating on the love of my life who has been here to support me through everything and then killing myself... I just can't. 

Idk what to do to cope.",1592700637.0,False,5,2,404-BrocasNotFound,None,hcxif1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/hcxif1/trauma_dream/
3,Finding myself again,"Am I the only one who has lost themselves since 2016? That’s when my trauma especially peaked and started for my 20s. But I don’t want to only be my trauma. And contrary to how negatively I view myself I am constantly reminded of how great of a person I am. I just feel awkward still. I don’t have a group of friends that I can go on trips with. Even though people have tried to get close to me I just can’t let them i choose my solitude. And then they just give up. I want to find my tribe to have a book club with, dance club, do crafts with. But I will just do it with myself until I find my tribe.

4,1am wake up thoughts,"F 25. Just woke up and I have been uncontrollably crying. I was diagnosed with BPD around a year ago and have been in therapy since. Various shitty things in life have happened to me, but my first trauma came from my dad (shock!) when he abandoned myself (8 at the time) my older sister and mum for a 21 year old woman. This absolutely broke my mum, she was severely depressed and from this age until I was 15/16 I was always scared she might end her life. My sister became rebellious due to trauma, but I went the other way and hid everything else going on in my life to try and protect my mum from feeling guilty as I don’t blame her at all and she did her best. The issue is that this trauma response of hiding things that I’m going through has made further issues with things that have happened to me e.g. I didn’t tell anyone when I was being bullied at school because I didn’t want them to worry, I didn’t tell them I was self harming at 13 etc and it was never noticed, being groomed online, covered up that my partner was abusing me for 5 years. My mum says to me that she thinks I have BPD due to my abusive relationship. I wish I could tell her everything else but I worry she would blame herself, when the person I blame is my dad for leaving us and not giving a shit, to then have another child and he is a good dad to him. Why did I never get that ? Since then I have had a strained relationship with my dad. We currently speak only about once a month though. When I was in my abusive relationship (ages 18 to 23) my dad cut me off unless I ended it and this also created a lot of trauma for me. I’m now in a situation where I feel that maybe I should say something to them. Or just my dad. Or I don’t know. I don’t want to keep carrying this pain alone. I just want my dad to be sorry and take responsibility for the trauma he gave me. Not sure if even attempting to see if he will do this will just give me more issues.

10,Almost certain I have bpd but unsure how to get a diagnosis,"I’ve struggled with mental health almost my whole life. Lately it’s been really bad and I have a LOT of trauma. I have every bpd symptom, uncontrollable anger, I constantly feel so empty inside, I’ll do any reckless thing imaginable when I get triggered ( reckless spending, drunk driving, lashing out, even cheating a few times which is horrible I know) it’s like something takes over and I can’t control it. I need constant re assurance and I trust nobody. I feel like a shell of a person walking around. Lately I don’t even feel like myself if that makes sense, I don’t even know who I am. I also struggle with maintaining my job, I manage but it’s so difficult. If someone says something even slightly rude at the wrong time I will lash out on them and not hold back. I feel like I’ve completely lost the person I used to be when I felt somewhat normal. I’m also just really scared to try and get help bc in my mind I think I’ll just be judged and belittled which will only make things worse.

11,Want to break up with my partner but not sure if it’s just splitting ,"Hello, I have BPD and I’ve been dating my partner for seven months. We moved in together a month ago. Things have been very bleak since we’ve moved in together. I’m extremely depressed and struggling to get through the day doing basic life tasks due to the depression. We have had issues living together such as her not doing chores when I want her to and also communication. I also don’t feel attracted to her anymore and haven’t for months. I don’t know if the attraction will come back and it’s very scary. I often think of other people when I want to get sexual. I’m not sure if this is a result of splitting because I used to say she was the most attractive person I’ve ever been with. Some negative feelings for her started happening when she disappointed me or made me feel unseen-I have childhood abandonment trauma so this made me shut off positive feelings. I have lost so much hope for us. I feel so lost in life. We just moved in a month ago and I’ve thought about breaking up a lot. I don’t know what to do. Do you think my BPD is making me think too negatively of her? Has anyone experienced this where you feel you want to break up with someone for months and then it goes away?

12,I’m new here,"My most recent psych doctor suggested I have BPD, and it honestly lines up with my symptoms. I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around it. I’ve always had the extreme mood changes, and the thing where if someone does something “against” me, I will think of them like an enemy, if that makes sense. I had pretty significant trauma in my childhood and I’ve heard that’s common for this diagnosis. I’m also in recovery from alcoholism and an eating disorder. One good thing about it, is that I switched to DBT in therapy which I like, and have tried new meds like a mood stabilizer in addition to an SSRI, which never worked alone. I’m not as suicidal, like I was for awhile. So there’s progress. I just, I have this overlaying feeling that to my core, I am damaged/broken/unworthy. Like there is something wrong with me. It gets worse when I have to interact with other people, and I feel so awkward and overthink everything. But when I don’t interact with other people, I isolate and the obsessive thoughts of unworthiness gets worse. I’m ranting, I know. I’ve never posted here or really talked to anyone about this besides my therapist. I guess I’m looking for support? Tools? Connection? This shits hard.

14,I’m in so much emotional pin right now- I can’t move,"I’m going through a divorce. I’ve been off my medication for the last month due to things out of my control.

The situation ships seems like it might be fading away and I’m beside myself. I don’t know if he’s actually pulling away or is genuinely busy. I’m also realizing that I was putting off grieving my marriage and now it feels like the walls are crumbling. 

I’m lost inside my feelings. I can’t stop crying or being upset. It hurts so, my feelings are so deep and consuming. I feel nauseous and dizzy. All I can do is lay in bed. I can’t eat, sleep or think straight. Im not going to hurt myself but the thoughts are there. I’m in hell, I want it to end right now so badly. 

I reached out to my family and they’re helping me get more medicine but it will take weeks before it kicks in.

15,"Help me please, I don't know if I should've said all of this in an email.","Below this next paragraph is a letter I wrote to a psychologist office, as I am actively seeking treatment for a personality disorder(/s?)

I will preface this by saying that I am in no way trying to offend anyone in this group. I know I am not diagnosed, but I am almost 100% certain that this is what I'm living with. I haven't been to a doctor since I was a child - let alone a specialized one - besides involuntary suicide-watch nights at my local hospital and the occasional urgent care for the flu. So it is safe to say I have no idea what I'm doing. 

I would really appreciate your guys' thoughts on this email that took me an hour and a half to write because I got sidetracked.
            Love you all! ❤️


--‐-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not really sure how to come out and say this, but here I am. I believe I have BPD +ADHD. I hope you're not offended by my self-diagnosing. I can assure you that I am not saying these things because I *want* to have these personality disorders. I have lived without doctor interference for my entire life, but I can't continue to do that, so I started looking into my symptoms and what they might present. 

Upon extensive research, I display most of the symptoms in the DSM 5. At first I believed it might be CPTSd, but I more resemble BPD+ADHD. This has caused my relationships with employers, family, and friends to plummet. It has been severely impacting my life and I need help before it's too late. It's taken me a few years to seek help because I thought that it would buffer itself out - but it hasn't. 

I have had an extremely traumatic life, beginning as a child and ongoing to today.
I feel like it would be a huge burden to unload all of my trauma on somebody - and I don't want to re-live any of the trauma myself - so this has caused me to stay dormant and struggle by myself. 

I understand that I need to get an actual psychological evaluation and I am in no way trying to negate that fact. I know I am no professional. I am just stating what I believe is true so that I can find somebody qualified to help me. 

The best way to reach me is through E-mail or a scheduled phone call. 

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this, and I hope that together, we can figure this thing out so I can function like a somewhat normal human being.

16,I think I have BPD i need help (TW),"I'm 15 years old and I'm definitely sure I have bpd, all the symptoms match and I find the 'bpd experiences' relatable too. I can't get a diagnosis done because I'm a minor and my parents are strictly against visiting the psychologist. I've asked them to take me twice but they've raged both times. I feel empty all the time and I do self harm but not as frequently anymore. Sometimes I feel like I'm perfect but the next minute I wanna rip my face off. I always have this urge to isolate myself and shut myself off. I've gone weeks without talking to my friends and I don't understand why I don't feel like talking to anyone. My life is always either really good or really bad. I hate everything. I've attempted once with painkillers. 
I keep asking my friends if they hate me to the point where they've told me to stop.
It's fine when I'm hanging out with them but when I get back home I start overthinking and it's just frustrating. 
I've been sexually assaulted multiple times as a child and grew up seeing domestic abuse and that really fucked me up. I think trauma from that turned into bpd but I'm not really sure

17,I subconsciously forgive the people who have hurt me ,"I think this is mostly because my memory has gone to shit. But i don’t hold grudges, i can’t hold grudges even if i wanted to. My parents for example, the biggest thing my parents have done to hurt me is lie to me about my biological dad, created a whole fake scrapbook to keep up with the lies, with false dates and names. I would not have found out the truth if The biological father (who i don’t have in my life because i chose not to) hadn’t found me and told me the truth himself. My parents made this all about them, my mom made excuses for herself and my dad felt betrayed and ignored me for weeks when the truth came out, he expected an apology from me. I never had a good relationship with my dad, i thought i hated him he was always angry at everyone, he was verbally abusive and strict af, i couldnt breathe around him. My mom stopped defending me because he would just yell at her and then she would yell at me saying she would never defend me again. Every terrible argument i had with my parents ended with me telling myself “remember this feeling remember how hurt you are-remember their words dont forgive them for this” But i always forgive even without an apology. I moved out almost 2 years ago and i feel safer, im not used to arguing and being yelled at anymore, but now ive become more sensitive to everything, i still see my parents from time to time and when they yell or bicker with me in the slightest i cry and i kind of start to tweak out. They look at me like im crazy and tell me i dont know how to handle discipline i dont need to cry over everything. I dont want to fucking cry but i cant help it and knowing that im making a fool of myself just bawling my eyes out makes me more angry with myself and my reaction to things. My mom has put me in mental hospitals just because she didnt know what to do with me anymore. After my first and only attempt to take my life she became reliant on mental hospitals to just take me away whenever things got bad. And that brought more trauma, so mucb happened to me in those places and she swore it was meant to help me. Then i was in a residential treatment center for 2 months, i had to live there, i didnt see the outside world at all. Thats when i got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and thats when i started to hate myself more. 
Theres so much i could say this isnt even half, now all i will ever be is my trauma its made me into such a complex person and i cant deal with myself anymore. I dont feel a strong love for my parents, i could move to a city far away and never talk to my entire family ever again and i would be fine, except my little siblings ofc id miss them. No matter what i can forgive my parents which is without saying because they’re all i have. But even past boyfriends , past friends who have destroyed me i can still talk to them because i dont remember the hurt i felt only the action, and i do forget sometimes, so people take advantage of that, the people in my life know that they can walk all over me and i wont hold it against them for too long.

18,It helps knowing I'm not alone on here,"Hello, I recently found the sub but I've never posted. 
     I have never been formally diagnosed with any personality or mood disorder but ive been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. 
    
Also from what I've found on those sub is that it might be really difficult getting diagnosed. 

I know myself to blow up at people when I feel ignored, inadequate or when I feel abandoned. I always end up blowing up at the wrong people, even people who love me like family. 

I don't know why I get so upset and enraged. I always know it's wrong and that I need to stop because I always say the worst possible disgusting things or do things I absolutely will regret later.  

Even when people are trying to help me or show me tough love I just always get unreasonably upset.  

I feel like I've always been too much for people or never enough which has caused me to do things like multiple one night stands, do extremely impulsive things like spend money irresponsible which has led me to sleeping on a friend's couch. 

The only way I've managed to not have an episode or blow up is to walk away from things. It's really difficult. 

It does make me feel less alone reading what other people have to say about their experience on here but it also makes me hopeless because I have to deal with the outcome of trauma which wasn't my fault.

19,Introducing Myself ,"Hi, everyone. 
You can call me Rowdy. I was added as a mod today so I thought I would introduce myself. 

26(f) 
I was diagnosed at 24 with BPD and OCD. A few months ago I was diagnosed with ADHD. I’m also a divorced mom of 3 with some ✨ trauma ✨ Im a full time employee at a pellet mill. We make bio fuel. I operate big equipment and I can run the plant from a computer screen. Avid lover of hermit crabs and dogs. 

I am very passionate about supporting others with BPD since I have not had much support dealing with this illness. This illness is very stigmatized and misunderstood. There is a lot of misinformation that circulates around social media platforms. I really understand how hard it can be for us to get the help and support we need. 

So guys, I’m here. I’m going to be as active as possible between parenting and working. I’ll be taking time to familiarize myself with the mod responsibilities. 

Thank you all for finding this group and trusting each other with your struggles and victories. I’d like to work together to keep this group open and active.

21,Venting," 

Im sitting here writing to myself again. Everything is falling apart. I feel weaker than ever. I feel like my mom hates me. She said that I am a shame to my father who abandoned me and that she has done nothing as a mother. I have never felt so much pain in my life. I sobbed like a toddler in front of her. Because she knows that I blame myself for my father leaving me. She knows how much I fear abandonment. So for her to confirm that even my abusive and alcoholic father would be ashamed of me hurt more than anything could ever. She said “look at you, I did nothing.”She feels like she failed as a mother and in result of that I am a failure of a daughter. We failed each other. after I told her how I felt and opened up to my struggles she didn’t respond to anything I said and only made an issue out of the fact that if anyone were to find out about what’s going on all the blame would be put onto her. While I opened up to her about my bpd diagnosis and how I feel on a daily basis she was only concerned about how it would make her look as a mother. She says every-time I have a breakdown its the same story and same excuses. Which is true because none of these issues have ever been truly addressed and worked on. I can sit here and provide reasons as to why but it would sound like excuses and manipulation so I give up. I failed and I am a shame just like my father to her. She says my father still controls me and its true. I just don’t know how to stop it. I want to get help but all outpatient treatment options have several week/month waitlists, and although I have signed up for them I feel like I don’t have that time. She wants change immediately. She wants me to go cold turkey and suddenly change my life around to happiness and butterflies. Because if other people can do it so can I. But I just don’t believe that. No matter how much I try I just cannot. 

She thinks that I purposely do things to disrespect her (smoking weed). I know that smoking weed is destructive, it is my addiction. She believes that addiction is a choice. She kept saying if I wanted to change I would. To her it is simple. She does not understand the complexity of my mind and the things it makes me do. She believes that I am purposely manipulative. She thinks I don’t want to put in any effort. She thinks I am choosing to be a victim but she doesn’t understand that trauma traps the person in a victim mindset. That a person with untreated trauma is constant living in the exact state of the time of trauma. They are stuck reliving the trauma if it is untreated. She doesn’t understand how it affects the brain. She doesn’t understand that not everyone is the same. That just because she was able to deal with all of her trauma (that was  much worse than mine) doesn’t mean that I can do the same. I am not the same as her, but she expects me to be. She doesn’t understand that my thought processes are corrupted and that in order for me to regain control of it I NEED therapy, I need to learn how to unlearn and rewire my brain to adopt healthy coping mechanisms and thought processes. She doesn’t believe that therapy can help you help yourself. She believes its all a business and that people use mental illness diagnosis as an excuse for their bad behaviour. She keeps telling me to help myself but I literally cannot do it on my own. She keeps telling me to do the same thing over and over again expecting a different outcome. Dealing with my trauma alone will never work. I can accept that but she cannot. 

I am sick and she doesn’t understand that. Because she is angry at me and angry at herself. Angry at me because she thinks I don’t want to put in any effort and angry at herself for creating a child like me. 

I feel alone. And I feel like all of my negative thoughts about myself were confirmed by her. Because I don’t think that people understand to what degree people with BPD hate themselves. The self hate is debilitating and constant. Ever since I can remember I have absolutely hated everything about my being. And when you don’t care for yourself, you make decisions that reflect that. The self destruction I engage in is not intended to hurt others it is only intended to hurt myself, because I feel worthy of hurt and pain. When I am in these long periods of numbness it is true I lose my sense of empathy. All sense of any emotion. And it causes me to hurt her. Because I am unable to even consider her feelings. I am sick and I hate it. I hate what I do.

I understand her anger because it is the same way I feel about myself. I just wish she could understand me. I wish we could break the wall in-between us. But every time she says things out of anger it makes me want to build the wall higher and stronger.",1652030374.0,False,15,7,ImpossibleBicycle249,None,ul6h66,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/ul6h66/venting/
22,"""Traumatized"" by my worst BPD spiral and breakdown
","First of all, I want to say I know the word trauma is thrown around a lot and here I'm not using it to make a claim I fit the diagnostic criteria for it, just using it in lack of a better descriptor so please don't come for me about that - I'm aware it's likely not the correct usage, just can't think of a better one currently and I think it gets the point across.

This fall and winter I had the worst spiral and breakdown of my entire life, related to a toxic relationship with a FP that also has their share of mental health issues and addictions.

I ended up breaking it off and I moved to another country afterward, which was planned anyway before.

The relationship was ended but we still had contact and it was of course all ups and downs, BUT. My current issue seems to be more with what has already happened rather than what it is now.

I get what I can call ""flashbacks"" of what happened between us, how I felt, how my mind interpreted it at the time, and it just sets me back for the moment, feeling empty and terrifried and in so much pain, again. When I can center myself in the present moment I'm very much aware of the progress I've made, of how this person really doesn't have a place in the life I'm trying to maintain and while my thoughts and feelings aren't ""good"" or even close to normal, they're not unmanageable or terryfing.

When I get a ""flashback"", it feels like I fall into the abyss again and it hurts so bad it makes me bend over at moments. If I didn't know I had BPD, I'd think I was having a heart attack. All the feelings are back and I can't stop my mind from very rapidly producing the ""BPD thoughts"" that devalue myself and life itself to absurdity even though an hour ago I would be more or less stable and thinking in a more balanced way.

I'm supposed to move back to the city where I lived, where it all happened, and it would be a very good choice for me in all aspects of life, however - I'm terryfied of it. I panic when I think about having to go back. Because I know I'll have to pass the places related to all these events during my episode and it makes me feel like it's gonna be twisting the metaphorical knife in my chest that I can't seem to pull out.

What seems to be my problem is not suffering for this person in particular, I feel like what hurts me now is this whole series of events that had me breaking down and having the strongest psychiatric intervention of my life. This period of my life that lasted a few months feels like hell, like I've been sucked into another dimension where out of everything in my life ever, it's only the pain and fear that exists.

I don't even know what would be the right term for what I'm experiencing and have no clue what kind of help to seek for it.

23,I never thought this day would come,"Typical BPD bullshit can’t keep relationships. Meaning my current and longest relationship has been almost 5 months.

They have been the best 5 months of my life, he even saved me from my childhood home which was abusive and filled with trauma. 

At the beginning of our relationship he promised me he wouldn’t watch porn and would only look at my pictures if he needed to take care of business (we set this as a boundary), I’ve always been super insecure but have done everything in my power to trust him.

Lately I’ve been having this feeling he’s getting sick of me, so I check out his phone and OF FUCKING COURSE he’s looking at porn.

And was still lying like a rat on top of it all until he finally admitted it.

Everyone I’ve talked to about this says it’s normal and I should let him just do it.

But I feel so betrayed, hurt, and miserable about this situation. I’ve been sleeping ever since this happened yesterday, then his mom has the audacity to say I’m playing mind games and am controlling.

I’m trying so fucking hard to do this one right but of course I fuck it up once again.

He said that I don't have to tell him my history now but he would like to know at some point. There is one aspect that I feel more at ease talking about but when I tried to tell him a couple of days later he was completely immature about it.

When I took more than 30 seconds to say what my trauma was he got annoyed and said "" okay hurry up."" I told him to be patient because this was hard. He then said,  
okay well can I read while I'm waiting?"" I was so shocked I just got up said I was walking the dog and then left.

We talked afterwards and he admitted that his reaction was inappropriate but did not apologize. I was obviously upset and was just quieter and less present during this evening. He mentioned that when I get like this I bring down the vibe.

My mom and grandmother take it as days to make themselves martyrs and just make everything absolutely miserable.

How much I try and how much it doesn’t matter. But now I’m a mother myself and I just don’t even want anything to do with it. 

I had hoped I could like reshape Mother’s Day after I had become one too, but it just hurts even more.

27,Recovering BPD,"
I’m new to this group, but I’m not sure if you all feel similarly. For me BPD takes form in many things but mostly separates into two versions of me: the Rational version and irrational version.

Rational me: wonderful person who is accountable, kind and caring.

Irrational me: impulsive to a fault, and doesn’t realize he’s speaking in mostly black and white thinking, mixed with suicidal, abusive and manipulative actions.

It feels like alone, I’m not as much as a burden but when I’m dating someone seriously for example my current partner of two years. I’ve managed to cause so much trauma to her.

I hate myself almost everyday. Why? I’ve essentially been exactly like how my father was to my mother despite having promised the younger me I’d never. While, I know it’s not my fault I didn’t learn the right coping mechanisms if at all any. I can’t help but feel like it’s me doing it so it’s my fault. I can be great for days and weeks but then an incident brings me back to square one. I always feel like I’m having to push the rock right back up the hill again for it to never reach the top.

Has anyone here had similar behaviours and how did you deal with consistent need for validation out of fear of abandonment. For example, I ask my partner if she’s loves me a ton less now because she’s almost on the verge of leaving and she can’t really tell me it because it’s drastically decreased.

It feels lonesome, I don’t know anyone with BPD and I wish I at least knew one who successfully treated their symptoms to give me hope.

Yet I still re-enact the same dysfunctional dynamic over and over in different relationships with new people.

Due to this, i developed an anxiety attachment style which has been destructive for my mental health. I have tried going to therapy but I’ve been turned down because they dont believe my story and I honestly dont blame them. So every-time i got into a new relationship, i try to please my then mans in every way possible… be it unlimited excess to my body, running me over or just plain mistreatment, I would accept it because I didn’t wanna lose the guy.

31,BPD vs RAD,"I have BPD (current diagnosis) and was treated for reactive attachment disorder at a “troubled teen home”. 

I’m 21/F and was misdiagnosed with RAD (reactive attachment disorder) as a teen after I came out as gay to my parents. They blamed my “unhealthy attachment to women” as “mommy issues for being adopted” and claimed that I acted out and had behavioral issues. While I did have severe attachment issues, RAD is usually given to kids who are violent, constantly rebelling, and have no attachments at all. I never once was violent towards my parents or even threatened them, and my “acting out” was me texting my girlfriend at the time behind their back because I knew the consequences if they found out. My parents were also heavily involved in the church. I had good grades in school, never had issues with other kids besides typical teenage drama, never used any substances until I graduated (good ol’ MJ but nothing more). I did struggle with SH and my entire mood would be dictated around my girlfriend at the time, and I did feel as if I would pass away without her. However, those feelings never manifested through anger outwardly. 

 I was sent to the institute for attachment and  child development in Colorado, who’s notoriously known for mistreating and even taking the life of children. Just look up Candance Newmarker for reference, she was a victim to the same administration under a different name. The results of the treatment left me with years of trauma and it wasn’t until I was an adult when I got the BPD diagnosis and started doing therapy for it when I finally started healing. Therapy/meds for bpd has truly changed my life for the better, while therapy and meds from the RAD places made me even worse than I already was. 

I can’t seem to find any solid research on the differences between BPD and RAD and how detrimental it is to treat someone with BPD (who doesn’t have RAD) as if they had RAD.

32,Friends who put a time limit on plans,"Hey guys,

I have a question. Do you guys find it necessary for a friend to constantly put anyone limit on how long you will be hanging out? For ex: making plans for Friday and saying they can hangout for a few hours? This is a recurring thing. My friend and I are busy and don't s e eachother much but she always does this. Like sure we aren't going to hangout 24 hours, but why do you need to explicitly say how long we are going to hangout for? I would just leave after a few hours lol... The fact she has to let me know how much of her time she can give to me beforehand signals to me that she doesn't want to hangout that bad even though she will say how she can't wait to see me. When I hangout with others they don't do this, they just leave once they feel like it or if they have an actual plan or something they have to get to after like work or something they will let me know. But the fact this friend has to make sure I know we are only hanging out for a few hours on Friday evening bothers me and makes me not even want to go, delete my fb and just stop talking to ppl all together. She knows I have no healthy friends besides her right now and I don't understand why she has to go out of her way to make me feel like I'm only good enough to be around for a few hours. Like she's the fucking queen or something. I'm just sick of it and I feel like it's a way for her to be better than me because she has a family and a spouse and is busy busy and I have school, depression and trauma...

33,scared ive ruined the love of my life,"hi, i’m seeking support and advice for my situation right now because i feel extremely lost and don’t know where to go from here

for about a year now i had been together with who i considered to be the love of my life. and i can tell it’s not just me being obsessed and idealistic like i usually am, i finally found someone who i can truly trust and love wholly and purely and they just feel like home. i admit that like all relationships there are things to work on, especially as we’re both just in our early 20’s, but i’ve noticed recently that even with the endless love and understanding they give me as well as absolutely no reason to not trust them, i am still extremely anxious and insecure and jealous to no end, and ironically it’s been getting worse the closer i feel to them

i’ve been realizing especially with how great things had been in our relationship that i really do need to work on my trauma, bpd, and similar mental health issues, and well the guilt from still feeling the way i do all came to a head recently and i ended up splitting on them bad one night, and it fully dawned on me that i just am not healed or stable enough to carry on like this.

so now i’m here, single again, and feeling awful because i had never been with such an amazing person in such a safe relationship. and while they promised they would wait for me to work on myself, i’m scared for my life that i’ve ruined my chances with them and i’ll never get to be with them again. i don’t know where to go from here and i don’t know how to deal with this fear of losing them forever, as well as now having to cope with the lack of contact and love and attention from them (contact is not on the table because it just makes me panic harder)

35,*Need Support/Advice* Self Sabotaging,"My FP has been the guy I’ve dated on and off (more off recently) in the last 2.5+ years. However, I have this terrible habit of self sabotaging and pushing him away by lying and making up scenarios, rebelling like a child, or starting arguments for no reason.

36,Chronic Numbness/Emptiness *mention of suicide*," 

So I am currently sitting here in front of my laptop and this is probably my tenth time in the past month trying to write out my feelings but every-time I tried to it felt so forced and fake. The numbness I feel is so debilitating it makes me feel like I’m not a person. I don't feel like I am real. Someone on reddit said that bpd emptiness specifically feels like constant numbness simultaneously accompanied with a heavy tension. It feels like there is constantly something weighing down my chest. But I cannot process what emotion this weight stems from. However, one feeling that I am able to feel is kind of a worry/fear. Because when I have gotten in these numb episodes in the past it has never ended well. It resulted in months or even years of my life wasted due to a lack of motivation, of care, of any effort at all. Because after a certain point of feeling empty you stop caring about everything in the world including yourself. 

I'm so scared of feeling the full extent of my emotions because every time I do I feel like a freak or a fucking monster and I always regret it afterwards. Repressing my emotions in the past has led me to self destructive behaviours like failing out of school, self harm, and using sex and drugs as an unhealthy coping mechanism to try to fill the void. As these episodes progress it causes my self hate to grow and grow to a point where it makes me suicidal, because while everything is getting worse and worse I am fully aware of how bad it is but I still can’t do anything to change it. This adds a constant guilty feeling over everything. The guilt of not doing anything to stop it. The guilt of knowing better but not doing better.

It feels like I’m digging myself a deeper hole with each day that passes with this emptiness. And thinking about pulling myself out of it makes me feel so exhausted and drained. It takes sooo much effort out of me to do so. Feeling the full extent of my emotions feels like walking into a battle field with no amour. And it never feels like it's worth it because in the end the cycle will restart and I will find myself deeper than the last rock bottom I rescued myself from. Apart of me knows that because of my bpd this cycle will not necessarily ever disappear because the trauma I’ve been through has rewired my brain chemistry in irreversible ways. However, I’ve been through enough therapy and read enough books to know that trauma is an inevitable part of life. I know that I have to accept the things that aren't  in my control and change the things that are. I know that trauma has both the possibility to shape people into success or failures and ultimately it’s up to me to make that decision. 

I've heard of stories of people altering their lives with therapy and developing healthier coping mechanisms but the question I always seem to come back to is how do they make it last long term? Why does it work for them and not me? I too have gone to the gym for 6 months consistently and have gone to therapy for months on end, ate a good diet and got 8 hours of sleep every night but there comes a point where slowly one by one each of those skills and coping mechanisms tip toe out the door one by one. Almost in a way where I don't notice it fully until they are all gone and I am left barren, all alone with the dark twisted corners of the inside of my head. No where to find comfort, no where to feel safe, no where to breathe smoothly. Each time I feel like an idiot for thinking the cycle is over.  Boom, I get a trigger I can’t handle. A trigger that the gym can’t take off my mind, or therapy sessions don't help with. There it is. Consuming me and swallowing me and I have to sit patiently waiting for it to spit me out so I can breathe again. So I can try again.

37,I am not a monster,"I am slipping away into a very dark place. I am so scared. \
Me and my partner have been together for nearly 2 years. I love him to death. He has his own mental issues and I have mine. We’ve both done wrong to each other and I’ve learned to admit mine and I apologize sincerely to him. \
I am trying to hard to improve, sorry if this post is all over the place I am a mess at the moment.\
So basically he told me he joined a reddit support group for loved ones with bpd. I was so happy to hear that because I thought he was trying to see the world trough my eyes and look for support. \
And then I looked up said subreddit and I cannot shake this panic. That place is not a support group, unless you are leaving/planing to leave someone in your life with bpd. \
Now that is what’s got me spiralling. I cannot lose him, he means the world to me and I just want to get better for myself, so I can do right by him. \
He hardly believes me and I am so scared he will finally ditch me after reading through that sub. \
Please, I need some support. I am not a monster, I don’t want to cause him pain. \
There’s so much more to it than I am able to write now I feel so detached from everything. I just want to be loved. I never wished to have this trauma inflicted upon me by my abusive parents, I just need to be loved. \
My thoughts are so warped I am so lost and so afraid of what I might do, I need him to see I am not a villain, I am sick, but I am seeking help. I cannot cope with this life any further if I lose this connection I have. \
I am so scared, he joined that sub with the best intentions and now I am terrified he will just accept his life is better without me and go through with a breakup. \
I know I am capable of so much more. I just need someone to stay, I am so alone, so tired of fighting to be loved and understood. I hate this illness so much, I don’t know what to do, I guess I am just looking for some support here. Thank you if you read through this.

38,Still healing,"So I was in a very trigger bonding/abusive/maniplulating/controling/etc relationship for almost a decade. I was 18 when we met. I've been diagnosed with bpd a while ago. And that relationship is over now. I've been in an extremely and almost shockingly healthy relationship for over a year and a half. We have incredible communication. Even though I struggle, he is so great and communicating with me. The only thing I noticed lately is that, we were having a talk because I didn't like how something was handled (not important) and we spoke about it and had a great conversation. I then said wow I hate these kinds of talks I'm still not used to it. To which he wS surprised and said how I should be used to it after how long we've been together at this point. 

My thoughts; I went through prolonged trauma for almost a decade. A year year a half won't just change what I experienced and learned how to cope with (in an unhealthy way) for so long. Am I wrong? 

Also, I feel like not a lot of people in my support group take bpd serious enough. I'm really struggling and so often it's just ""trying harder""

39,Undeserving of Love,"I know it is in my neurotic nature to view things a little negatively, & I try to not let thoughts like these win.
 
I am 21 years old and I have gone through more trauma than most, not all, but most of anybody that I know.

I was molested as a child for five years by a trusted family member who was related to my childhood best friend. I was also molested by said childhood best friend.

I had seen somebody very important to me shoot themselves in the face, and had to force myself to be resilient enough to process that as a young girl still in middle school.

I had to lie to CPS at 15 out of fear of being separated from my little sister. I have three siblings in total, but we do not speak: None of them are borderlines. Just me. I am the black sheep. 

My father was a dead beat, who I had only met a handful of times. My step father wasn’t any better - a violent man who my mother only married and obeyed for her own security.

My mother was a diagnosed narcissist. A strict & controlling Jehovah’s Witness. I can’t remember the last time my mother hugged or complimented me. She usually expressed her “love” towards me with materialistic items such as steak dinners or cruises. 

That sounds nice, right? Sure.

But she was an alcoholic, too. She’s choked me against the wall by her arm and told me she’s wished I was dead. She was so controlling when I was a child - I didn’t have a touch phone until I graduated high school. Wasn’t allowed to drive, wasn’t allowed to close my bedroom or bathroom door, wasn’t allowed to have social media. I only had a flip phone that my mother controlled VIA her Verizon account which would flag her if I ever tried to text a phone number that wasn’t hers. She would email my teachers and ask them who I sat next to in class, who I walked with, and then eventually she applied to work at my school herself. 

I wasn’t allowed to date, have friends, go to the mall, go to the movies, go to football games or school dances.

She isolated me and constantly told me I had to represent her. Perfect, blonde, ladylike, and a daughter of God.

She would destroy my bedroom and take my little sister out for breakfast while I cleaned her mess up as punishments. She’d rip up homework assignments if I used her printer without permission and she’d take away my right to wearing winter coats at the bus stop.

She’d make me late for school to hover behind me as I covered bruises and cuts with makeup. Black eyes, busted open lips, bruised ribs and bruised legs. Her fingerprints bruised into my arms.

She’d tell me nobody would ever marry me and I would look ugly in a wedding dress. My parents have told me their love for me is conditional and my mother stole the first car I bought myself as a teenager to sell to my older sister. 

She even destroyed a piggy bank my great grandmother painted for me and in doing so said “she never loved you anyways.”

I was just 14. 

I also remember her sitting on my head with her hands and knees, pushing all of her weight into my skull. I was also 14. I remember laying on the bathroom floor just waiting for her to crush my head and kill me. 

I remember all the nights my mom never came to pick me up from work as a teenager, and I remember us fist fighting until my hands were covered in blood. I remember the boiling rage I felt when she’d pull me into a hug a few moments after, saying to me “You know nobody loves you more than I do.”

She’d force me to sleep with her sometimes, too. Not sexually. More like she would be drunk and would beg me to soothe her through the night. I fucking hated doing it, I didn’t want to soothe this fucking monster. This rotten woman…

But I did it anyways. Because she was my mommy, & I loved her. 

I did EVERYTHING for her. I existed for her.

I left home the day I turned 18 & fell into the hands of a lot of people who targeted girls like me. But I didn’t know this at the time - I idolized  people and believed they could commit no evil. 

Moved in with a boyfriend when I had no car, no job, no phone. He stabbed me in my arm with a knife once, water boarded me, raped me OVER and OVER and OVER. Eventually left me homeless.

The boyfriend before him cheated on me and ended up marrying the girl. He was my first Favorite Person & also a diagnosed sociopath. He told me he never wanted a family but had a baby with her so quickly..

I have a lot of issues from all of this, clearly. 

I developed severe OCD, eating disorders, PTSD, major depressive disorder, but the most difficult is BPD.

I remember when I was a little girl I would cry at my window for Peter Pan to save me. All that I wanted was to be a wife and a mother, I told myself that if I didn’t kill my self and just kept holding on, I’d be safe and protected by somebody who loves me. I’ll never be hit or punched or scratched or screamed at or gaslit or manipulated or brainwashed ever again. I held on tightly to that hope as I left home and ran straight to the nearest man that LOVED how fucked up I was. Naive and young and completely alone.

Did you spend your 18th hanging out with friends? I spent mine sobbing on my boyfriend’s doorsteps as I tried to quickly come up with a way to survive. I remember walking to work until my heels bled, I remember teaching my own self how to pump gas or write a check, I remember having ABSOLUTELY NOOOOOOBOOOOOOOOODY except for me.

I’ve realized now I probably am never going to get that happy family picture I always dreamed of. My life is way too complicated for the average person to comprehend and handle. I think I have been a fool for thinking my past traumas did not matter and that I could live my life unscathed.

People love me at first - they become obsessed over me. I’m the “different” girl, the “mysterious” girl. I’m a character to them but to me this is MY real life. Once they realize that my dark runs just as deep as my light, it’s over. I think people find me alluring because I am attractive and I am socially intelligent enough to morph myself into a reflection of your own interests. 

But once I let someone in, they feel blind sided. They can’t grasp how so much depth exists within one person. They do not understand how trauma forever changes brain chemistry during key developmental stages. They do not understand how hard I TRY.


I’ve tried so many different angles. But none of them work.

I think I am meant for a life of solitude. I used to think maybe I could only date another borderline, or a therapist. Someone who really really understood.

I don’t want to be a statistic. A lot of people are usually surprised to learn I have a cluster B personality type because I am just so good at playing the social games everyone is so easy to understand, so easy to see, and so easy for me to predict. 

I have a hard time meeting others who are the same as I am. Sometimes I even wish I was with a narcissist again. 

I don’t know. I just think, with assisted dying being an option for those with BPD & all, I just think we should not even fucking be here. Even the professionals know that. Clearly.


Nobody is ever as emotionally intelligent as I am, and no it isn’t the grandiosity speaking. But I feel like if I have spent the time to learn about myself and my triggers and my emotions, why can’t others do the same to themselves and also to me? I thought that is how it worked? 

It is because they LOVE me. But they don’t love ME.

Worst comes to worst if I am not married by 40 I will just adopt. Perhaps I was meant to be a therapist… & only that. I wanted to be a licensed clinical social worker, I wanted to write books about the brain, I wanted to conduct my own  research on psychology.

I wanted to do this alongside someone, as their wife and their child’s mother.

I’ve never cheated before. I’ve never hit someone I was with. I’ve never called a partner a bad name, I’ve never left them to cry alone.

I loved people until I got to the point to where I have realized I am simply, plainly, unlovable. 

I have a good brain that could be put to work, so I suppose I should stop trying to love people so much and just focus on what I know I can excel at instead. Just bluntly accept the fact that I am indeed wired wayyy differently than the rest of these people, and begin to live accordingly.

I do not think I was meant to be loved. My chances at that were destroyed as soon as I was born. Before that, even, stress in the womb from my father knocking her up and then running away.

All I want is love.

40,My therapist ghosted me.,"I’ve been seeing this therapist via telehealth for a couple months now. I see them 1-2 times a week. 
3 months ago my insurance stoped covering therapy and I had to go about a month and a half without sessions while they got my insurance to cover it again. 
After they got my insurance situated I had one session where we really started to uproot a lot of my trauma, and at the end of this session they said they were going on a month long vacation across the globe. They mentioned that they could do only emergent sessions if absolutely needed while they were on vacation. I was fine to try and wait for them to return. 
About halfway through their vacation I needed an emergency session. We worked through what was going on. Everything was fine. 
They returned from their vacation a few days ago and I was set to have a session today. A lot has happened since that emergency meeting and I really needed to talk. I was really really banking on this session. 
Nothing. No email. No link to the session. No nothing. I sent emails and I called and no response. My session still said it was scheduled and it was never cancelled. 
I’m angry and I’m hurt. I feel helpless and lost and like I’m drowning because I really needed this session.

41,What do you do when you can’t really get over a rejection even it’s been a year passed by?,"In October 2022 I was in my second year of high school and I got involved with a guy in my first year. We had a very short relationship that didn't work out because he found out that I had been with someone and didn't want anything more. I didn't even like him that much, but after the exclusion, you know, I couldn't understand how someone could be so cruel. I tried for time and time to talk to him, and when I tried in person I got dumped, from then on I was ignored and ignored. The guy is an asshole, he blocked me from everything, everything, and I spent the whole next year (2023) trying and trying things, going from hate to love and I'm not proud of having done things like sending a gift box and also of having spray-painted his house at the end of last year because of how much I hated him. He told me terrible things, the last conversation I had in July after my mother died was a sincere thing, I tried, you know, to explain why I wanted to be on good terms with him so much, I even talked about my disorder and He seemed understanding at the time, but then he sent me an audio saying terrible things, that I was very clingy and in short, I suffered so much... I always wanted his attention, his apologies, I created a trauma from that, I couldn't stand having to see him and at the same time I could see him from afar anywhere in the school. To this day I know the Instagram, the Steam profile, and I still look at it every now and then just to feel bad about it. Because I know there is no going back, I TARGED HIS HOUSE. But anyway, I want to move on, I can't take it anymore, it hurts so much, I feel crazy, I feel humiliated for having humiliated myself and I don't know what to do with all of this.

42,I’m the BPD loved one and the one that has to step away,"
In a nutshell, my fiancée and I ended things little less than a month ago. My BPD took over and I became a person neither of us could continue to love. I miss her more than anything, there is and never had been a lack of love in our relationship but there was a good amount of drama and trauma on both ends.   I wish more than anything we could be friends and be in each others lives but I unfortunately broke the trust I was granted and I can’t do that anymore. I have to keep her safe from the dark parts of me and though I’m feeling as if I’m starting to heal I still need to step away. I can’t hurt her or myself anymore.   It’s so hard being so in love with someone, being capable of being nice and civil  and being able to be there for them but knowing that the reason you can’t do these things is because you love each other too much.    


I don’t think you’re on here but if you are…  I’m gonna miss you. I’m gonna hope every day that you’ll reach out but I’m not gonna hate you if you don’t. I won’t even be mad if you don’t.  I just pray you take care of yourself and I pray for your healing.

43,I’ve Been So Much Happier Lately,"I’ve spent most of my life coping and making poor decisions for myself. I’ve spent so many years wanting to, ya know, end my suffering. 

I was diagnosed with BPD/OCD 2 years ago. I was devastated with the BPD diagnosis due to the low chances of being able to get help. Therapists are hard for us to find. Some of us are medication resistant. Truly, I’ve never had a medication or therapist that could help me. 

Then I met my current psychiatrist. After meeting me a few times she asked me if I had ever also considered an ADHD diagnosis on top of the OCD/BPD. I told her I had thought about it considering my son, my mother, and my youngest sister have been diagnosed with ADHD. She evaluated me. And low 
and behold, we added that to the list of things “wrong” with me. 

So, she started me on medication. Life changing is an understatement. I know my symptoms are unique to others due to the multiple complex disorders I have. So, this will not be everyone’s experience. But the medication has not just alleviated adhd specific symptoms, but my BPD/OCD symptoms have greatly subsided. I don’t wake up every day wishing I didn’t. 

My impulse control is better. I’m a happier, more attentive mother and partner. I handle my stressful life situations better without my brain automatically going straight to “must die.” 

Guys, I don’t really have many people to talk to that would understand what a relief this has been. I know you guys live with the constant pain and recklessness so you understand what a dark, hopeless mindset we tend to stay in. 

Today, the weather is beautiful. I’m feeling good inside my body. I feel beautiful again. I feel human. I appreciate the oxygen in the air and the blue of the sky. I applied my self tan. I’m shopping for Easter baskets for the kids (not Christian, just for fun). I’m finishing projects. I’m moving up at work. I have debt and bills and serious life stress and trauma. But I’m grateful for the moment. 

I hope everyone here can find a way to feel peace. I’m sending everyone vibes of healing and abundance and peace. If you read this far, thank you for allowing me to safely post my moment of brightness in my life. Ive never felt pure happiness before now. I’m grateful for this.

I went in the kitchen and drank some Hennessy so I could turn off my emotions and maybe go to sleep. He woke up and said ""babe what's wrong? Are you crying? Are you drinking"". I told him I just need to go home. It is because I didn't want him to see me trip. He said you're drunk. You can't drive home drunk. Understandable. I told him I'm just gonna sit in my car for a sec to be by myself. He said okay. As Im walking out he says ""babe you have no pants on""... great. Now I really look crazy.

I have a job + i am in college and basically do everything on my own so i am not a burden or anything. I’ve been diagnosed with Bpd, severe anxiety and depression 2 years ago and I’ve been regularly seeing a therapist and trying my best to overcome my trauma. 

Since i was a little girl as little as 5-6 years old, my mom always talked about how she wanted to abort me but couldn’t and how she wished she never had me. Through years of emotional and physical abuse, i tried to hang on to the glimpse of love and care she had for me but to no avail. I tried to build a relationship with her even when i became an adult, i tried my absolute best to show her it doesn’t have to be that way and we could be very close to each other and how despite everything i still loved her and for a while it was working, we became sort of best friends. 

Then she has these episodes where she suddenly gets back to her old abusive ways. These last couple of months she has been worse in terms of how she abuses me. Every time i see her or talk to her she tells me how she just wishes I die or get murdered and she wishes she can do it herself choking me and watching the life drain out of me and she gave me so much details on how she would love to do it, or for me to off myself and make it easier on her. I’ve been more anxious and panicking a lot more lately and it doesn’t help that i am under a lot of stress working a full time job and managing university at the same time my schedule is almost 80 hours a week and i just can’t handle it all, i might as well just make her wishes come true and just off myself.

I have no trauma, no self-harm, no emotional dysregulation. At first glance, I'm pretty normal. I've never quit a job because a boss was mean to me (I am good at holding my tongue/kissing ass if theres something in it for me). I've never gotten literally **obsessed** over someone. Sure, my interpersonal relations are as bad as they could imaginably be, I have enormous issues with delayed gratification, my impulsivity is very bad with respect to my vices.

49,Talking with my work/coworkers about my BPD,"Hey ya'll,

Last year I got diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. It has been quite the road having discussions with my family and friends. At first, some of my friends reacted as ""That puts all the pieces of the puzzle together. I'm glad you explained."" Others don't seem to want to take the time to REALLY understand what having BPD means and how it can positively or negativity effect a relationship. My family on the other hand, completely denied me.. for months, just about a year. I can still hear my dad swallow his pride when we have conversations but he is coming around. 

Anyway I do have some trauma with sharing my experiences with BPD because I have had to defend my own disorder at a time when I was already feeling guilty for even sharing or denying it myself. 

I understand that sharing my own personal experiences would be helpful for my coworkers but honestly, they are not all safe people for me to open up to, so I want to be technical with what I share. I really want to have them understand what having a relationship or in their case, working with someone who has BPD can be like. 

I know I want to mention to them that I have repressed trauma that will come up randomly and result in, wherever I am or whatever I am doing I have to leave and go process however that may look. (Usually for me its having multiple mental break downs until I feel better.) 

Has anyone ever gone through this process before? 

Anyone have any advise on what topics of BPD I could discuss with them?",1564013579.0,False,0,3,mommasaidnoEm,None,chgaqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/chgaqw/talking_with_my_workcoworkers_about_my_bpd/
50,Ghosted. Posting to process. 👻 😞,"I think this ex of mine may be ghosting me and it’s making my stomach churn. We dated a couple years ago. He’s a good person and we left things on decent terms other than that he really pushed my boundaries when I needed space to a point that felt intrusive. I really needed an indefinite pause because feeling pressured to be more available than I had capacity for made me feel super frustrated and guilty. I didn’t want to be temperamental.
Recently I reached back out. I took a really long time to do that, in part because I wanted to be sure I had healed enough to be a good friend to him and hopefully not end up in a similar holding pattern.
He was happy to hear from me and we talked for awhile and had coffee. It seemed like a genuinely kind connection still. He is doing better in life overall, making more $$, seeing someone new and it’s going well.
I am genuinely happy for him and also felt like maybe that would make it easier to be friends again too, since the boundaries are clear. He said not being in contact had weighed on him and that it felt really nice and relieving to be back in touch. 
Anyhow long story short, last we texted he was going to give me some eclipse glasses, and we were planning to have another coffee when he returned from a weekend trip to see the full eclipse. And weeks passed with no word.
I texted this morning and basically just said hi. The message was delivered but no reply.
It’s got me feeling super anxious and anguished & weird, like it was wrong or foolish of me to try and stay friends.
A couple years ago, he had professed such deep care for me and had said (sort of jokingly but sincere) I am going to stay part of his life whether I liked it or not.
I guess I believed that & it’s why I took the risk of reconnecting. I am thinking it’s maybe not true anymore that he wants to stay friends.
Honestly if I was in his position I might have a hard time if an ex popped back up two years later.
I didn’t think he was the type to ghost ever, or I might have been less open with him when we met. I shared good things in my life and also was honest about some recent traumas and that I haven’t really wanted to date much, that when I’ve tried it hasn’t been fun.
Anyhow, I’m feeling sad at another loss. Gratefully I have some beautiful core friends that I’ve stayed fairly close with for decades. It helps me keep in light that I’m a good solid friend to a number of people who don’t think I’m “too much.” 
But the amount of connections that meant something real and then disappear or end painfully — it really warps my brain. I’m feeling so anxious and foolish and like a failure: 
I know it’s not true but I thought I’d vent here instead of just sitting here feeling stuck and bad.
I think I’m stressed about a lot of things and that my brain is snagging on this.
I’d love support, reassurance or relatedness, though I’m definitely not looking for advice.

so me (18F) has bpd incorporated with bipolar 1 symptoms (my psychiatrist told me that and i’ve literally never heard of that), i’ve been keeping a relationship for maybe about 6-7 months. which is amazing for me but i’m seriously struggling mentally with myself. i’ve been having ptsd flashbacks of my deceased grandmother (i was very very close with her and saw her dead as a ‘vegetable’) so i have difficulty with shit because life’s no fun when you get a vivid visual of someone you love dead with their eyes open. i have been dropping weight recently because food looks like her corpse and i can’t eat it because it feels disgusting and wrong. i was friends with my bf (18M) for 2 years prior to dating and opened up to him and so he knows me fairly well. i try to turn to him for support maybe last minute when i’m already about to explode with pent up emotions but i don’t know if he just actually doesn’t really understand or if he’s choosing to not even try to understand. but i’ve been feeling unwanted. genuinely by everyone and it’s been a feeling for a while but people will sometimes say a remark that fuels it and really kinda hurts. i feel like what i do is wrong no matter how much i try to do right. i want to express this to my boyfriend but i don’t want him to think that i’m unsatisfied with him or something, i feel like i should say something because i’ve been having s_!c!dal ideations kinda? like whenever i do something wrong i immediately feel like taking my life is a good solution/option.. but i don’t want to die.. i just want it to stop so i can be normal and okay, at least just as a mask so that i’m able to deal with it myself behind closed doors. i know i should probably say something to my healthcare professionals but i don’t want the mention of hospitalization to pop up since it’s awful here and does more harm than good. i don’t have anyone that shares the same diagnoses with me that is actually rational and logical. so i have no one i can personally ask. i’m sorry if none of what i typed makes sense maybe but i seriously need someone to talk to that understands

52,Mom makes it about her,"Both my biological parents have severe mental illnesses. I was bound to end up with them too. I was adopted by my bio dad’s parents who ended up emotionally abusing most of my adolescent years. I was told my whole life by my adopted parents that my bio mom was an evil person who never loved me and my bio dad loved me so much. As I got older I found out that it was the opposite. But because of all my childhood trauma and genetics I ended up with bpd, bipolar 1, anxiety and c-ptsd. I recently was able to move out of my adopted parents home and move across country to be with my bio mom. I’ve been here for over two months and it’s been a big lifestyle change. With my adopted parents I was given the most expensive things and taken on lots of vacations. Now with my mom we are living in government housing for the mentally ill. And recently our apartment got a massive flood from heavy rains. In the two months I’ve been here I haven’t had much issue with my mental health. But the stress of moving across country into government assisted housing and then the flood, my mental state has declined a bit. When I woke up this morning I wasn’t in a good headspace so I stayed in my room because I didn’t want to snap at my mom or my 4 year old sister. I finally got up at 11:30am and my mom wouldn’t say a word to me. Then it was time to go get my sister from preschool and I always go with to get her so I was getting dressed and my mom told me I wasn’t allowed to go and to go back to my room until dinner and not interact with my sister tonight. When she got back from getting my sister she came in and started yelling at me for not getting up this morning. I tried to explain to her that I didn’t want to snap at her or my sister and she went off on me saying that’s she’s stressed too and that I need to get over it. I feel guilty for not getting up this morning but in over 2 months not once have I needed to take some time alone to keep myself from breaking. This is the first time and she’s punishing me for putting my mental health first.",1694726340.0,False,3,0,Acceptable-Bench1937,None,16iu9yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/16iu9yv/mom_makes_it_about_her/
53,I don't know how to be with just myself...,"To explain, I am always texting my LDR partner. I can't ever feel normal when we're not chatting that way. But her job is slowly migrating back to the office and that means she won't be with her phone during that time. It's apparently just for a week before going back to working from home. I'm not sure how it works; her country / job is really weird and harsh. 

But for context: when she's asleep, or we don't talk much I feel myself slipping. I feel empty. All I can do is wait for her to talk to. It's been like this for over a year. I've completely gone dependent on it and I know that. I don't remember how to be alone with just myself anymore. I get anxious, I get more depressed, I feel guilty for feeling clingy. I'm also not in therapy right now cause my therapist retired and the only one they had to offer me was a middle aged man... and I have trauma with men, so I couldn't do it. 

This is kind of a vent and asking for help? Are there any online resources for those with BPD and being alone? DBT tricks to how to cope or distract ourselves during these times? I feel like I've forgotten every vital skill beyond not self harming because I haven't done that in quite some time but... I also have a form of bipolar too (I can't recall which one) but I'm in that area where I'm completely depressed and passively suicidal on my best days and I am... actually kinda scared for myself when this has to happen next month.

54,"BPD, memory issue related question","Hello everyone. If anyone knows anything about psychology, how the brain works, or anything about BPD in general any suggestions or answers would be very helpful!! So I don't normally post stuff about my mental health issues (unless I'm just in a really bad way and I have no where else to vent but social media, then I'll do that but otherwise I won't post) but I thought it would be a good idea to post my question here. I was diagnosed w/ it about 3 years ago I would say and I've had it ever since and my mom, therapist, and psychiatrist have been starting to think I've had this for a while. But for the past 2-3 years esp this year, it's been getting harder and harder to remember things. For ex this esp happens a lot w/ anything school or college related. Last fall semester I was bran new to college it was my freshman year. I had 4 classes I was taking all that were morning and lasted throughout late afternoon. I would get the syllabus I read over it. But I believe it was on the first Friday of the first week I already had a quiz but it was over the syllabus. I had read the syllabus and I knew there was a test but I wasn't sure what info would be on the test. So I read it over that night and that morning when I got into class before it started. But when it came to the test, the test had questions on it and I couldn't remember anything at all. This is just one example. Later that semester I got a planner so I could write my assignments down. And I did write them down I even went to my accessibility counselor to come up w/ a plan for writing things down and I would go in every Monday once a week to write the assignments and/or tests/quizzes for that week or if I had any papers do. I would write these down but when the test/quiz came up I didn't remember until my professor had mentioned it in class about two days, sometimes it would even be the day before the test and then I would have to spend all the rest of the day studying, or all the rest of the days I had left to study and because I spend so much time typing up flash cards on this online website called Quizlet, and I didn't know what info would be on the test either and we had to use the info from the power points which were somewhere between 20--50 slides on each PowerPoint. And this took me all afternoon and even way late into the evening to type up so I barley had enough time to study. I even pulled 2 all nighters in a row one week. And then because I didn't have that much time to study I barley remembered the info for the test/quiz the next day. My question is, does anyone in this page have BPD and have you experienced problems like this? Or does anyone experience bad memory problems in general? Did you ever overcome it? If so what did you do to fix it, or at least relieve some stress off of this issue? I ended up having to drop out of the fall semester classes cause I got to stressed about it.

56,I can’t afford DBT and I don’t know what to do.,"Hi all,

Hope you’re doing as well as you can today. Remember your best IS good enough.

Long rant to begin with?

I got diagnosed with BPD in November 2023. I was lucky and able to access three months of outpatient treatment through the public hospital. (In Australia for context).

I am middle aged. I have the BPD trait of impulse spending. I wised up to building “wealth” and had a small bit of savings after working on saving for 18 months. I have never owned property, always rented and now my minimum wage doesn’t cover rent (and I’m gracefully living with my elderly / ill father. I don’t know how long he’s got.)

I quit my job (3 weeks before BPD diagnosis) because of my abusive boss and his horrible daughter. They both made my life hell, I was working 12-14 hour days. He threatened all employees (not just me) but the threat of “we’re going to put you in a PIP and terminate you” was too much to bear. I am the extreme of sensitive and cry at the drop of a hat. It’s crap. It had some savings behind me, however, I was unemployed for months and they soon disappeared.

I was bullied as a kid for being poor. I was bullied in high school for being socially awkward / different / gay. I’ve never had a lot of “true” friends, and without my dad, i don’t really have someone to reach out to.

I used to be conventionally attractive and rather healthy in my teens. When I finished high school, I lost my first serious relationship where my BPD symptoms were all over the place. My fault 100%. I sometimes go back and write to apologise to them, but choose not to. It brings up too much.

In university I made many friends and for a good 10 or so years we connected, they were accepting of my quirks, life was ok.

Then COVID happened.

(We know how that panned out. Still panning out.)

I also lost friends because of different life paths and how that stuff goes. No one did any wrong, we just drifted apart.

Then when things got back to some sort of “normal”; I joined a queer affirming church (religion does play a part in my heart, however, I do not condone abuse, murder, exclusion, and extortion in the name of Religion.)

I’ve made some friends there. They all live rather far away and I haven’t been to church since my diagnosis.

I also got a new job in March and I am enjoying it. There are a few downsides, yet only one that irks me.

There is a woman I work with. She is approximately 10 years younger than me. She is one of those “sickly sweet types” (100% me issue, not her issue. I know this.)

So far she has stated:
- Her fiancé has bought her a 170,000 car
- She controls all finances and her fiancés money is put into her account. 
- She had her braces, current car, and all overseas travel paid for by her brother.
- She is about to marry a man who is about to inherit millions of dollars.

She’s definitely a bit of a BS artist; I think we all can be, as life is tough. However, ever since her arrival my BPD has flared up. I am poor. Always have been, always will be if I don’t change my life.

As DBT costs 21,000 AUD + and is often ran during the day (when I’m at work); I cannot access it. 

My executive disfunction is rife too.

I am not close to my siblings as they are generations older and have their own lives. My extended family isn’t close either; my mum was an only child and dad avoided his family due to trauma. I don’t have many friends and I can guarantee I am sh*t at being a friend.

I am so lonely, facing tough times because Australia is only for the rich; and I can’t move countries to try something different. I only work in admin and I suck at crafts (but enjoy them). I enjoy reading too.

If you’ve made it this far, you’re amazing! Thank you for reading my ranting.

59,My abandonment anxiety has been spiking LONG,"Tw: SA
Also no kink shaming please. 


We’re two girls in a super loving relationship. It’s not been too long since we started dating — two years and few months — but after spending my twenties and thirties in one terrible relationship after another and trying to repair trauma through meaningless self destructive sex this is the most loved I’ve ever been. She respects and loves me a lot.


Sometimes it’s just hard to believe that. I was part of a kink lifestyle when we met and we went to a couple of meets because she was curious. And she loved them. More than I did. When we agreed to be exclusive we agreed on monogamy with the occasional threesome or event. 


I had a traumatic near fatal accident last year, and for whatever reason, she didn’t help me immediately. She was busy but she could’ve made the
trip and it would have been late.

After that I just, idk. I realized how much I want to be with just her and not have this brutal fear of abandonment and just have a more conventionally monogamous relationship, where it’s just us.

My years of polyamory were years of dissociation and memories I’d rather skip because I never felt loved or prioritized. The sex parties were..:I never had fun there. I was just recovering from SA and just wanted to be obliterated. My partner knows that now but she still wants to go these parties whether or not her going hurts me. 

And I know it’s like my own BPD but each time she talks about how damn hot someone in that kink space is and keeps talking about it in a tone she usually reserves for me, I just…feel like the most inadequate bitch on this planet. She knows that the whole scene just causes me terrible memories and it was a bad time of me basically prostituing myself to anyone I know. And like…I just wish she’d understand that instead of talking about how she’s now determined to go to the parties with or without me, no matter how I feel. 

I feel terrible about reneging on what I told her when we got together about still attending parties but like…I almost died. And that changes you. 

I’ve never been in a really loving relationship before and my girlfriend is so fucking awesome and she’s like my favorite person on this planet — she’s super smart, super kind, super loving, super caring, super beautiful; everything I’ve ever looked for in anyone. I’m grateful for her every day. But just sometimes when she talks about how hot someone is in a tone of 🥵🫦🍆💦 I…don’t feel prioritized and all these girls she talks about are vastly prettier than I am. She says this relationship is the most important thing to her but sometimes when she’s like “idc if you come to the party because I intend to go” I just feel  cold and empty. 

I know like me she’s allowed to change but I just…feel like it’s a matter of time before she decides she wants that lifestyle and hotter girls before me. Im afraid that I’m being incredibly possessive but I…I want to be a better girl for this woman. She’s the kindest and most empathetic person I know and she always makes people’s days better.

I've been diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, and surprise /s depression/anxiety. I have a question that's been bothering me lately seeing posts about BPD awareness. Essentially, there's a strong idea that there's manipulation and anger.
I most certainly don't feel outward anger, although I was close to figuring I may be turning it on in myself instead (side note:the trauma from my youth has made me avoid confrontation, I avoid at all costs angry feelings and actions [mostly through fear])

I also, as far as I know (we all dig deep for these worries eh) do not manipulate people. I believe I did in my early 20's via promiscuity, but manipulation would encourage rejection in my mind so why would I do it now (lesson learnt also early 20's)

I guess I'm worried that I agree and relate to so many BPD statements but am worried that it's prescriptive. That I manipulate and don't know it.

61,trying to be a happy adult,"As a quick question, what do you guys do to cope with bpd or heal from traumas? Especially without a therapist or medication 

I actually had therapy and meds since I was 13/14 years old, till I was 20 last year I stopped using my parents insurance because I completely distanced myself from my family and honestly everyone all my friends from the past because they all just were shit to me. 

After I left rehab when I was 17, I still had my bpd symptoms but I experienced a weird like 2 years just not feeling real. I don't remember much of that but I just really dissociated all the time. 

I started having friends again, smoking more heavily, did risky things more than ever. I even tried almost not even wanting to think about the past, I wanted to reconnect with my family a bit. But pretty much every single of those people ended up really hurting me. There's so much that was happening. My life honestly felt like hell to me, and it hurt my soul that growing up I've always thought about how the hurt seems to only get worse and worse. And here I am wanting to just be okay, start living independently. But my family doesn't give a fuck to admit their mistakes, these friends are all fake, people think I'm weird. I still get anxiety at work hoping customers don't notice or say anything about my arms covered in scars. 

But I'm so tired of suffering from my past wounds I want to just get rid of but why does the pain stay? I know I'll have to struggle with my mental illness, and just try to maintain it. I barely managed to get an insurance but so far it hasn't helped, I hate when these things list places that don't accept them!

62,Disclaimer: Long Post <3,"⚠️PSA:⚠️
There’s no such thing as being behind in life or being behind in society…the only things along those lines that are real are social constructs, societal bias and comformity, generational trauma, closed-mindedness, desperation for validation from other people, the illusion of superiority in the form of unnecessary, unwanted, and unasked for judgement, the fear the government specifically designs to control the people to get more money and power, peer pressure, and unhealthy perfectionism. Don’t be a sheep, allow yourself to be a unique, beautifully imperfect human…life has no set schedule or manual, so stop comparing yourself to others. Don’t be afraid to be different or go against the societal/social norm. Learn to be okay with being controversial, and unlearn society’s unrealistic standards. You’re uniquely you. It’s not your job to keep everyone else happy. However it is your job to keep your peace and to do what’s best for your life, your plans, and your mental health…even if it upsets people. You’re worth it. Stop caring about what other people think of you and other people’s opinions…they’re just that, opinions. It’s time to stop fearing other people, they’re only human, just like you, with their own flaws and challenges and personal hells to go through. If something doesn’t affect you, just shut up about it and don’t butt into other people’s business. It’s not your life, it’s theirs, and you’re not them. And to incorrectly assume you know exactly what someone might be going through or what it’ll take to cut them into one of society’s boring, sheep, conformist cookies, is just so wrong and sad and pathetic on so many levels. Again, you’re not them, you’re not in their mind, you’re not in their situation, so shut up about things you know nothing about, doesn’t matter if they’re friends or family. It’ll just make things worse if you judge and assume. And things you say literally have the ability to stick with people and rewire their brains and change their brain chemistry, so don’t be the reason people start thinking that they’re not enough or even the reason they start considering unaliving themself. Be the opposite. Perfection doesn’t and will never exist, no matter what society says. Fuck society and their unrealistic, engineered standards. Don’t add to society’s toxicity, half of them don’t deserve the time of day. Your imperfections are beautiful. Additonally, always try to spread love, positivity, understanding, unconditional support, and empathy wherever and whenever you can, you never know what someone else might be going through and you could even be the person to restore their faith in humanity 💖

I’m proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself too, even for the baby steps. Some progress is better than no progress at all, ignore the haters and don’t let them put you back to square one…and don’t let them make you even think that you’re back at square one when they’re not you and don’t have your mind or your experiences, it’s not their life, and they have no right to judge your progress, especially when I know half of your progress most people are too blind to see…I see your progress, and you’re doing absolutely amazing 😊

To me the core of BPD is feeling emotionally invalidated but the. To survive we have to suppress and deny our emotions...my autistic logical brain hates this.

They get in the way of doing anything because I just haaaave to do what I feel like doing or stop trying to take action on unwanted tasks to avoid meltdown.

64,"Dating Among BPD, The End....","[Prev Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/s/GH7IUvIApk)


So i started dating someone with BPD, me also being diagnosed with BPD.

How it started : we longed for each other, we understood each other. Felt like we were made for eachother.

How it was : her trauma dumping on me and being the therapist for her after she promising me she won't abandon me and this is gonna last. I did promise the same thing.

How it ended : i got latched on to her, she was my FP, she splitted, i begged her to stay, she just abandoned me......

The confrontation and the explanation of my emotions during the end: the tail end of explanation to a messy short lived love story.

----‐-------------

I couldn't understand that she was having a splitting episode, cuz i couldn't understand what was going on.... i loved her too much that i made her my FP, and when she split on me, it made me really miserable. I used to go in and out of panic attacks, some lasting for about hours to recover back and get back to working. Lasted till yesterday, untill i figured out what happened, and explored those emotions.

So what i feel like happened :  I had a traumatizing event when i went out for drunk, the friend i went with got bruises and concussions and was hospitalized, i was in shock, cuz i was the one who saw the whole thing and took him to the hospital. She wanted my attention even though i told her i was in shock, i gave it to her, supported her even though i was in shock, i wanted an distraction at the moment, i told her my traumatized event, she just moved away from the conversation. After a while she splitted on me saying i wasn't attentive enough. Did not know what was happening. I went with it. Tried being supportive didn't work. I begged her to stay and not abandon me, as i was fucking miserable. I tried to reconcile, cuz i accepted her as a FP, after a long time. Nah, she didn't want me anymore, i thought she would understand me and stuff, nah she just wanted to use me and make me feel like shit. To be noted, i was hesitant in the relationship. She is the one who convinced me to be in the relationship. My abandonment issues are at its max now.

So after everything i saw a post on my recommendation, where i saw someone splitting on thier loved ones, the fucking texts were literally the same. Damn i felt scammed.........

So after figuring out my emotions , and realising this was already over, i confronted her. She was still hostile towards me. When i told her she had splitted and alsked her to read upon some resources, she fucking told me, if she started reading upon BPD, she is gonna become more of a BPD person.

WTF!!!!!

Damn, that was the final red flag i needed, i actually thought she was working on herself and stuff, she then started accusing me of having BPD and how the hell would i be able to help her. This was a moment of enlightenment,  damn, i became so fucking happy and void of feelings for her, after being so miserable for a while. I did have a feeling that i was the one who pushed her away and i was the reason for abandonment, i kinda felt different after . Nah, she was the biggest redflag i had ever dated.

The happy part is this made me understand, the difference between the people who try to be better and the one's who use narcissism to deal with their issue.i have splitted with my partners, but not like this, never hurt them. If ur in this sub, its most likely that u r dealing with ur issues, and not being a narcissistic ass. This makes u a good person.

Also thanks for this subreddit for being my support system, i did really get some amazing support during every post or milestone during my short lived dating adventure.

65,Struggling a bit with a breakup and overall hard life.,"Edit: I’m sorry for not responding to the comments; I deeply appreciate the support.  I’ve been really trying not to panic over my situation and working on not being homeless.  I know that I cannot support myself financially because of my mental illness, and my mental illness + trauma (from not just the breakup but a LOT of other things back to back over the last two years) cannot get better with the looming threat of homelessness and lack of proper medical attention.   I’ve just sorta been unhinged for days now.  But I’m still here. 



There’s a lot to unpack and if I went into details, this post would be really long and probably unappealing to read (because of length).

I don’t have very many friends and I don’t have any family at all.  My partner broke up with me a few days ago (they had left me at the exact same time last year as well in a way that was extremely traumatic).  

I’m really doing my best to work through my feelings but I only see a therapist once a month and have been back on medication for about two month due to insurance bullshit. 

I don’t want to call a suicide hotline; but I really need someone to talk to, or just check in with me.  Being alone is scary but it really is amplified when you have no skills as an adult and no family.

66,Relationship stuff... help.,"Hey Folks,

This is my first post here and I hope that I don't violate any rules of such with this post. 

So, I'm a gay guy (27) and have been with my partner (26) for nearly three years, which for one of us seems like a triumph, but I have a couple of nagging doubts which are ripping me up inside at the moment and I wanted to reach out for some help if I could. 

My beloved is a survivor of rape, so we've never been a couple which has had a lot of sex but in recent months it's been that he's been having more problems with disconnecting sex from our relationship. He says the more he starts to see us as a lifetime thing, the less he wants to have sex with me because he equates it with the trauma of being raped. 

Then, I agreed to an open relationship, again I know some of you are gonna shoot me down for this because of the BPD, but as I said, I agreed. The problems in my head now are that I cant get over the feeling of ""I love you, but I don't want to have sex with you and I want to have sex with other people"". It is killing me, because I'm trying to reassure myself that I can fuck whoever I want and that sex doesn't always mean intimacy but it's tearing me up to the point that I just want to leave. Half the time it's not even acknowledged that I find it hard to deal with, just that it's the status quo.

69,I'm in desperate need if anyone can honestly help I'd be extremely grateful. Unfortunately I can't find a therapist to help me even if my life depended on it here in Las Vegas.,"My psychiatrist is on leave until restrictions are lifted and that could happen who knows when. The last therapist that I seen on the 26th of last month stated ""I'm not even equipped to help you, just looking at you your suffering from severe PTSD, you also have an extreme amount of trauma from your past and to be honest I can look at you and know your going to be medicated from the rest of your life."" I'm desperately trying to seek help but unfortunately it seems to me no one here in Las Vegas is either equipped to help me or they just don't take patients with BPD because of it being so stigmatized or maybe they've dealt with horrible patients in the past I honestly don't know. I'm seriously here seeking help I don't want to be medicated for the rest of my life and I really don't want to feel like this anymore. To be truthful with you it's like I'm living in my own hell with nonstop flashbacks and I'm trying so hard to battle this mental illness on my own and I really don't know how long I can manage it. I'm in desperate need of help because at this rate I'm going to be living my worst fear....being alone....only with my deep, dark and empty thoughts of nothingness. If there is any help your willing to give, I'm willing to take it. I want to be functional, I want to fall in love and have a life one day before I die. All I know is I didn't case it or give myself this mental illness, It's unfortunately not curable but can be managed through alot of therapy, I honestly can't control it....but I am desperately trying very hard too and I'm just extremely exhausted mentally and physically at this point. I fully understand if you can't help or won't be able to help this thread is honestly my last hope so whatever help your willing to give I'll be extremely grateful for any numbers you give me to call if you have any.

70,"Can't never be alone with myself anymore. Obsessed with bf, abandonment issues","Hello people! I don't know where to write this and if this is the correct subreddit I should be writing but idc I just want to rant and get help maybe or some advice...

I'm 20F and I live with my boyfriend this whole year. And everything is so lovely and good and I'm so grateful I have him. He heals my heart... and this.. this is the bad thing. I thought leaving my parents that I was so attached to would help me with my abandonment issues that I didn't thought I had all these years and recently noticed. All my life I acted so independently, I never asked for help, I acted 25 when I was a little child, always caring about others more than myself but not a people pleaser. I just didn't care about myself much.

When I was a baby until 7-9 I was so attached to my parents I always felt empty when the house was empty once they left. I had this dread feeling in my heart and I felt it sink in and I felt the loneliness hit me like a train in only a few mins. I felt out of control and my thoughts drowned me. I couldn't stand myself at all I was so scared also. Now don't get me wrong we all have this fear as children that our parents won't return from the super market and they'll be hit by a car on the way and stuff, I had these thoughts as well but that was different. It is different still.

Fast forward to now, I have been trying to heal myself and traumas with homeotherapy and a bit of psychotherapy for the past 2-3 years. I have seen a lot of change in me I mean I do struggle with s. thoughts, self-harm, depression and many obsessions but I'm feeling healthier these past 5-6 months. But I've noticed that I'm great when only my bf is with me or I'm around people. I haven't been alone in more than a month, not even a single hour I think. I work 2 jobs for season and I return home to my bf I even cry or I express myself in front of him but never alone.. I didn't get a chance this month. And here is the deal.. today my bf unexpectedly decided to sleepover to a friend and I was waiting to go home to hug him and sleep but he told me while on work and this dread sinked my stomach again.

I felt like a little baby again. I felt alone. I felt myself for a bit. I realised I haven't been with my mind at all and I hated to feel it now all of the sudden. I needed preparation. There was a chance for him to take the last bus but he didn't and it's okay ofc he loves me a lot and he tells me every day but I felt the f abandonment issues to the core. I am not independent, I'll never be. I'll always stick to a person to be able to survive and to handle days.

I was living by myself and I ended up hospitalized and in a ward last year. I couldn't handle the situation even if I was 1 hour away from bf,parents. Now I'm far away from home and I've been clinging to him to be able to handle everything. Work is shit cuz it's work. I pushed away my 2 best friends slowly, I can't relate no more. I am alone without him. I need him more than he does, he doesn't understand what is like to be dependent with life to someone, to be so scared of them leaving you. I came home and thought immediately about s.h even tho I'm months clean and good.

Anyways all I'm trying to say is why? after all this healing, after feeling so good I accomplished things, why do I go back to 0 when I'm alone? why can't I just be? sober, healthy thoughts, alone? why baby me couldn't handle me and why can't I do it now either? how do I deal with this? If he leaves me one day I'm gonna end myself. I feel like I don't belong here.

71,Is it wrong if i identify with BPD even if i didn't get diagnosed with it? i genuinely feel like i have BPD," 

In 2017 i got a psych assessment when i was barely 18 years old, they concluded i had OCD withNPD/BPD traits, they decided to not diagnose me with BPD/NPD because of my level of impairment. I however know that i have BPD because of the symptoms i have displayed since i was a kid and primarily since i was 17, which is the age where it became gradually worse, and now at age 21 has reached a tipping point.

i Have a childhood diagnosis of Intellectual Disability, and recently (yesterday) they brought up the idea of possible Autism Spectrum Disorder, and many times have said they didn't think i had BPD, however i am still reluctant to accept the idea i don't have a personality disorder.

Over the course of 3 years and self diagnosis, BPD has been the core of my identity. I have felt humiliated and excessively obsessive when i tell people i only have ''traits'' as i feel it severely invalidates my trauma and the pain i face everyday.

I have told people online/offline that i have BPD, and i seem embedded in my rigid delusion that i genuinely have this disorder, I feel as if the psychiatric system has let me down and has not provided accurate results because i am a male, and because of my disability. I was referred to a dual disability/mental health hospital as an outpatient for a 2nd assessment and will receive a diagnosis in 2 weeks, however BPD still seems unlikely to them.

The reason i relate to BPD so much is because of the behaviors i have, i can relate to ''BPD feels like having 3rd degree burns'', and i basically struggle with substance abuse, self harm, anger which is often irrational, and i don't know who or what i am as a person, and i have severe abandonment issues, i also experience extreme irritability over the smallest of things and will split on someone, from all good to all bad, rejection sensitivity, getting attached to people and wanting to marry them after a day, i've also struggled with thoughts of violence, homicide, arson, and grandiose beliefs. You can see my comment history and outbursts on reddit.

My psychiatrist told me that this time i will receive accurate results, and that he and his other 3 colleagues who are psychiatrists are working extensively to give me the diagnosis they see fitting",1588650131.0,False,0,2,babyboi1998,None,gdqhxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/gdqhxy/is_it_wrong_if_i_identify_with_bpd_even_if_i/
72,I can’t believe I’m doing this,"TRIGGER WARNING: suicide, self harm and all that bad mental health stuff. (Sorry if I did that wrong). 

Hi redditors. I’ve never posted before. Thanks for reading and responding if you choose to do so. I’m sorry if the following triggers you or if you are struggling with the same brand of futile terrible I am. 

I’m at a point in my life where I’ve struggled so much and for so long that I’m just exhausted. I’m not angry or bitter or sad anymore; I just want it to be over. I’m tired of being confused all the time, completely disconnected from this thing called ‘life’ everyone seems to be switched into. I’m tired of being panicky and depressed and anxious all at the same time, almost all the time. Im tired of being at the mercy of my insane mood swings where I'm experiencing overlapping interchanges of all these conflicting emotions all day long. I'm tired of crying so often that it feels like my brain is going to explode in my own head and my eyes will just cease to function properly. I’m tired of being dismissed when I say I’m unwell (psychiatrist included) because ‘I’m doing so well’ - I don’t even know what this means or how you could conclude that from someone whose chronically unemployed, can’t finish uni or even leave the house or make eye contact with people without panicking. I feel like an absolute rotting turd most of the time despite what I’m putting out there (which feels to me like a shit show but to other people for some reasons seems completely normal).

People seem to consistently make this crazy assumption that I’m ‘intelligent and capable’ for some reason and therefore I don’t need help. They couldn’t be more wrong. I can’t accomplish basic tasks because I’m emotionally all over the place all the time and trying to do basic human things like pick what to wear in the morning sends me into shame spirals, suicidal thoughts and urges to self harm. I have no control over my emotions or impulses, I’m constantly floating away from my body and nothing feels real. I’m incapable of accepting any kind of affection or goodwill from others without completely self destructing and I don’t want to burden others so my relationships are nonexistent. 

I’ve dealt with thoughts, feelings, urges and attempts of suicide my entire life. Its pretty much always been a terrifying backup in the back of my mind ever since I can remember as a safety plan to escape the torture of life where I can always feel exactly how close I am to death. Some days feel a magnetism to it but a strong resolve to resist. Other days, I’m basically hanging on by a thread and not telling anyone so they don’t come and take me from my home against my will again. 

I just want the freedom to be able to make this decision on my own. I did not give consent to be born, and I don’t think it’s ethical to keep someone alive against their will when they are suffering chronically and there isn’t a solution. 

I just feel like there’s no way out. I don’t respond to medications and suffer from such severe side effects that my psychiatrist refuses to prescribe any more drugs. My old psychiatrist had me on 5 different meds and I was equally bad, maybe worse, but in a completely different way. Those who have had adverse reactions to medications will understand this. Being mentally ill or being on psychiatric medication is like choosing if you want death by drowning or self-immolation.

I do DBT group therapy, see a psychologist and psychiatrist but I still feel like absolute shit. Everyone seems to be going through the motions, ticking all the boxes, but I just feel like nothing has really shifted. No amount of bandaids is going to help me when I’m walking around absolutely raw with no fucking skin on my body. It’s excruciating to just be alive but because it’s not visible, and it’s a slow death, nobody cares and the state ‘has a responsibility’ to keep you alive. In my experience, everyone is all sad when someone kills them selves, but also calls them selfish because they’ve left so much pain in their wake. Being passed around a mental health care system that can’t really help you, is insanely expensive and practically useless makes me miss the days when I didn’t seek help, suffered in silence but could at least hold on to the hope that there was a possibility of getting better if I had the right help. Now I know that’s not even an option. 

I’m just doomed to relive this cycle of extreme pain, possible suicide, absurdity, exhaustion, sheer terror, panic attacks, extreme mood swings, paranoia, catatonia, confusion, dissociation, spontaneous stuttering, paralysis and fatigue, where I can’t seem to express myself clearly no matter how hard I try or connect with other people. 

I am incapable of feeling positive emotions. No matter how hard I try, I just can’t stop the anxiety, panic, negativity, paranoia and depression from seeping in. I fear my emotions, I fear my thoughts and the things in life I can’t control that are going to hurt me so I just live in a constant state of sheer paralysis, frozen in fear and bracing myself for impact.

The only thing that’s keeping me alive is the thought that my sister will have to deal with the trauma of my suicide. But it also seems like it should be unethical to keep a person in this much chronic pain alive. I can feel my body deteriorating, my mind is basically scrambled eggs at this point, and I feel like I’m at the mercy of an emotionally handicapped body that I have zero control over. I keep harming myself and those around me. I just want to die with a little bit of dignity but there doesn’t seem to be a way out.

Life seems to be one trauma after the next, and continued reluctant attempts to help myself that only end up in things getting worse. I was not made for this world. I wasn’t supposed to be here. Please let me go. I don’t want to hurt anyone but I’m so tired now.

73,Desperate- please read at least the first part,"TL;DR: I figured start with this part and if you want more you can keep reading. Need direction to BPD specialists who can assist me in finding a residential treatment center or at least ideas anyone has on reputable places. Only foreseeable options are treatment or death and I'm losing hope. Please help me if you can. Just a quick message even with a name of a therapist you know, no obligation to a deep conversation or need to caretake if that would be a concern of yours. 

Ok, so here's the thing... I'm 32, divorced with 5 kids. I've dealt with issues since serious trauma at 13, and have recently uncovered issues before that even. I've spent over a year in residential and inpatient treatment for eating disorders over the last decade and they have been temporary fixes. As issues have progressively gotten worse and gradually expanded to the point that my coping mechanisms, anxiety, and depression have all aided in my inability to handle life, let alone be a functioning member of society. I've alienated myself from most people because either I get hurt or hurt them. I'm terrified of what my BPD and other issues will do to my children but equally what my killing myself would do to them but I have absolutely no desire to torture myself with this life anymore. I am willing to give a facility a playbook of every way I can and have cheated the system and myself to 'keep myself safe', in effect either numbing or putting up walls. This will be stupidly hard and likely shatter me so I need to be sure I have the best possible place for me. 

All that being said, I'm no expert and there isn't exactly a guide out there to treatment places and who is best and worst and what kind of people they are most likely to be able to help. After hours of research online I can only conclude that every place will obviously talk themselves up and they all look mostly the same. I cannot do this on my own but if I can find someone who specializes in the field, they may be able to tell me which ones have at least shown the most promise or fit best with what I need. I'm from a town where anyone who says they 'specialize' in BPD also specializes in depression, grief, adolescents, etc. Hopefully, you see what I'm trying to say. To have someone who actually knows the personality disorder treatment community would be a priceless asset and who better to ask than those suffering themselves and who outwardly are working on things and speaking about their issues.

74,FRUSTRATION STATION,"Hey all. Thanks for having me here. 

I'm (27 FtM) struggling to prioritize in my life. Having finally gotten some self awareness on the borderline patterns of attachment, obsession, and trying to break out of this cycle of centering my life around unattainable or unavailable people, living in fantasy worlds, being super self absorbed, venting and only talking to people when I want attention, validation etc. that is keeping me from moving forward, gaining skills, etc. Everyone is so frustrated with me and I have had to come to terms with being emotionally abusive/neglectful to my ex, neglectful at my jobs and of my pets and self. 

It feels very awkward and unnatural and forced to try to be consistent in friendship, my habits, life. I never have had serious addictions besides social media and other peoples approval. 

Im exhausted. But I know I do have habits and can form new ones because I definitely have bad ones like laying in bed all morning or spending a lot of time in my head. 
Its just that every single day my mood is different even on mood stabilizers and I'm used to doing what I feel like impulsively based on mood, or what I'm forced to do. Which is a surefire way to spin out of control or feel hopeless. I need to develop my OWN locus of control and discipline and its just shitty that my moods are the enemy when they so badly crave validation after decades of gaslighting and being blamed for their intensity and destructive power. 

Im wondering for those who are actively recovering...what has really really helped you out of old coping mechanisms? What were you able to commit to?

I am PDA autistic and have ADHD or bipolar, still waiting on a psych evaluation, but one of my biggest struggles is finding something to be consistent with that doesn't end up trashed by demand avoidance or getting bored/splitting on it. 

Every kind of routine or demand outside of my fixations ends up feeling like swallowing pills or pinching your nose to eat something nasty until I just stop. 

 Everyone says to fight depression, meditate find hobbies and get outside yourself find something to do for others, exercise. 
But I legitimately feel my habits and mental copes are like gravity or a black hole and getting out of them or making changes in life exhausts me and I collapse back into them. 

I guess this is just what recovery is like. But I've tried Codependents Anonymous, talk therapy, astrology, divination, meds (except ADHD meds about to start those), being more social, creative expression. At the end of the day my brain always finds a way to invalidate destroy or get convinced that thing ""isn't it."" The only thing I come back to is taking pictures on my phone (never organized) and writing long rants on the internet. Im so bored of my SELF. And analyzing myself and recounting my past trauma.. everyone else seems to somehow find something to do, or to love, or commit to,, even when we have the same diagnosis and experiences. 
Ughhhhhhhhhh. 

Is it really possible to form an identity and learn how to commit? 

I'm so tired from fighting myself. 

It feels like a normal life is just within reach if I could follow the steps (apply for jobs, show up to jobs, budget the money, move put of home state, take care of my body, cook and eat, have a creative routine, go on a run, care for my pet, evaluate which relationships are good to have around, spend time in nature, set boundaries, learn time management, learn emotional regulation) so I can get to a place where I feel stable enough to really connect with others and not sabotage everything or get hurt because I picked someone wrong.

 But those steps feel so impossible when I keep proving to myself over and over that I will not stick with anything, I will sabotage everything, and every single day I have a new idea about my next big project or career path or what ever. 

How do you build trust with yourself or anyone else without consistent effort? 
The only way I feel motivated is to get a FP or romantic interests approval, or extreme outside pressure and fear of punishment. 

Im just so frustrated I could scream for days. 

Does it get better? And how! Does DBT help with this? 

Consistency is literally the key to unlocking life, and I feel like someone tossed it into a vat of concrete Im supposed to chip away at with my fingernails.

75,So Stuck RN,"I have had periods of being very well emotionally regulated, mostly when I am modeling good behaviors/actions for others. What ultimately happens is I am so focused on others that I forget to tend to myself. I’ve had a few bottoms. One came during the plague with social isolation. I then got a WFH job and social engagements got super hard for me. Looking back I can almost see my self completely unwind. Stop going to gym, stop journaling, stop meditating, stopped taking showers, changing clothes, brushing teeth, then stopped taking my medications bc if I take the ADHD meds I feel locked inside my head and almost paralyzed on the outside. By this time my head had 8 different trains of thought on 6 tracks and at least one wants me to unsubscribe from life and they constantly whirl around up there. I asked for accommodations from my company and they then found a reason to fire me (Top sales rep, most customer compliments) and I tail spun. 

So I swore I would unsubscribe from life before giving up my 325ft studio apartment (bc it was mine and I paid for it all by myself) and move back in with my parents. Soooo…..my brother let me crash with him. My head was so dark and so mean to me that getting out of bed seemed impossible. Sublet the studio to someone who is trashing it and also wants to sleep with me. (Uggggg)

So now, I have done EMDR, ART, DBT, CBT and I’m therapy and have a psych and I’m still in this rut where I JUST DONT CARE ABOUT MYSELF AT ALL ANYMORE. It’s like the spark or fire went out. I can’t seem to find it. Brother was paying for top tier therapy and now it’s been downgraded to better help. He’s upset he’s not getting a return on investment bc I haven’t been able to be more regulated for the last 2 years. 

I’ve gained over 100lbs in 2 years thanks to gastroparesis from Weygovi/Ozempic/Rybelsus. 

I now have a bedroom that I operate out of and while my brother can be super encouraging and supportive, lately I only hear what I’m doing bad/wrong.

Now dad has had heart issues, step sis going thru divorce from a narcissist - she has two kids 4/9 and she’s a flight attendant with her own Truman’s manifesting in such dysfunction rn. (Which is effecting the kids)

I can show up for my dad and step sis and my niece and nephew and lately, I put the very disassociated mask on where I’m modeling good behaviors, showering, changing clothes, doing laundry, doing sisters dishes and laundry and going to doctor appointments. Did I make my psych appt this month…nope. Dad in hospital. 

When those duties/obligations end…..I deflate back into a dark hole who doesn’t really care if I see tomorrow. 

2018-2022 I racked up over 30k in debt, so there’s a bankruptcy that gets to happen, and I’ve asked multiple people to be my body double so I can sit down and get the information I need so I can file it. Currently, if I go back to work, one of my more aggressive lenders will get a judgement and garnish my wages. It’s so traumatizing for me that I did this to myself that I don’t feel safe doing it alone. 

I filed for disability bc it’s actually proving that me acting as the Geico duck in the boat plugging all the multiple holes (my family’s needs) is enough to be a full time job and I have adhd, ptsd, BPD, anxiety, agoraphobia, social anxiety. I don’t have clothes that fit. So I have mostly pajamas. I hate going in public and won’t do social things. And I’m so dysregulated rn that I couldn’t imagine working part or full time doing anything. 

I don’t know how or when we crossed that tipping line of full heartedly believing that my life is worthless. I don’t matter, I don’t want to be here, and have made certain promises to not do the thing I really want to do while parents are alive, or in family’s house. (This is one area where black and white thinking is helping me.) I care more about NOT inflicting trauma on my family than I care about myself.

I very much wish that I felt/believed/desired like I was capable of going back to giving a fuck, and taking my meds, and showering and looking forward to working out, wanting to be social, enjoying life rather than I have XYZ task that drains my batteries and takes all my spoons so now I need 4 days to recharge. It’s exhausting. 

I cannot seem to create and keep a routine bc nothing is routine. I’m pulled to take care of the kids or dad has new appts nearly every week. I’ve lost enjoyment and fulfillment in the things that used to make me happy like painting or singing. 

Everything hurts, every muscle aches. I don’t feel like stretching helps.

I find that I am seeing or aware of every flaw of my body and limitations since gaining all this weight. I could go on and on.

I’m getting frustrated at my limitations and when the frustration hits I’m not able to positively spin it to find a way to overcome it, the frustration is too loud and draining and before I can even acknowledge it and catch it to try to reframe it, my batteries are dead. 

I don’t know where to start or what to do first. I assume it’s one little thing to the next. I just don’t know how to do it when i genuinely don’t want to be here and don’t care. I am truly stuck. Like stuck stuck. 

Anyone with any experience with this apathy and stuckness, I’d really like some help from people who have been where i am and found a way to care again.

I live in the US and our mental health resources are limited and sorely underfunded and my family doesn’t have the resources to put me in a nice place for 90 days that would force me to have a routine.

76,Currently terrified of dying a virgin and/or alone. Help??,"I'd say the title is pretty self-explanatory. I'm a virgin (21M) who was recently diagnosed after having a pretty bad episode that saw me be committed to an inpatient program. A big frustration that I've had for a number of years has been my lack of and avoidance of romantic relationships. 
Ever since I was young, I can remember liking girls and subsequently hinging a lot of my self-esteem on whether or not they reciprocated those feelings. 
As I got older, (highschool was especially rough) I was seeing my other more masculine guy friends getting into and out of relationships, as well as having a huge unrequited crush on my bestfriend/favorite person. After she chose my other bestfriend to be with instead of me, I avoided them completely, and became highly self-conscious. 
Off the heels of that ""friend breakup"" I started to just throw myself headlong into new crushes and entertaining relationships with anyone who would have me, which were not many, as my fear of being rejected lead me to avoid making the first move with people I actually liked. 
The last sexual encounter I had was in fall 2017 with someone I really felt like I had a connection with/attachment to, (we used to be really good friends, and she ended up telling me she had a crush on me after I, in rare form, made the first move). During our brief stint as a couple, I would find myself doing a lot of love bombing and mirroring behavior. When it came time to be intimate, I have always been incapable when it came time to ""penetrate."" I would start to dissociate and just be unable to take part in the moment at that point, and it would usually lead to intense anger that sometimes got explosive (never violent, but certainly volatile behavior from myself. Breaking things, punching walls, hitting myself, etc.)
Idk if I'm just impotent or something or if my past traumas of sexual abuse in my early childhood are affecting it, but every time I'm in an intimate situation, I just....""disappear."" Idk how to describe it. She said it was okay, but it would persist every time we tried to be intimate, and she eventually just ghosted me one day and I haven't seen her since December 2017, and I spent 2018 in shambles, in my mother's house, never leaving my room, and being a dysfunctional mess. (Which is still the case today, but 
Bc of this, it has made me hyper insecure in my relationships following that. It has ruined each of them, and I often end up sabotaging the relationship before it can even go anywhere. And every time this happens, I just go back to this dysfunctional state. I've only ever had 2 jobs, neither of which I was happy with bc we live in income-based housing and my mother doesn't have a job so I would have to pay the family phone bill, buy groceries, my siblings school/friend activities, etc. On top of my mom asking me for money every day for miscellaneous things which she would threaten to kick me out for if I refused her. 
I'm aware that my lifestyle is not an attractive one, and I want to work on myself, but I'm not in a position to really take any control. Doing it for and by myself just isn't enough for me bc I feel like I'm just going to be alone and incompetent anyway so what is the point? 
Idk, its 5am as I post this and I just needed to Express this bc I have nobody to talk to about it. Thanks.",1594716356.0,False,10,7,Angel_StrongXIV,None,hqxymu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/hqxymu/currently_terrified_of_dying_a_virgin_andor_alone/
77,It’s been a tough year...,Where do I even start... I mean my whole life has been chaotic and traumatic. But so fuck it let’s start out with my mom who was 20 years sober.. started drinking again when I was “living” with my parents. And then my parents got divorced and I was left with my abusive dad. I mean after she left he was nice to me. But 18 years of being scared of him was burned into my psyche so I couldn’t forgive. I graduated high school early my mom moved out of California (we barley talk) and I met this guy.. and I mean I did have feelings for him at some point. I ended up dating him. Then my dad moved away leaving me with no fucking choice to move in with (let’s call him N.C) and so I lived there and. Back track I WAS LEFT WITH NO MONEY NO SUPPORT NO CALI ID OR BIRTH CERTIFICATE (I got all that now) so I was stuck being a babysitter for N.C’s siblings and I did anything I could because I had no way to get a job so I was fucked. And I was only making 20$ a weeks (that N.C STOLE FROM ME ALL THE TIME) I was depressed and lonely. I didn’t even feel like his girlfriend or anything. He treated me like shit. And I wasn’t myself at all. Then in September my grandma passed away so I had to go to a town I used to live and a LOT OF trauma started there. Where every single night of my whole life I’d have nightmares about this place. So when I was there I was having a mix of flashbacks from actual events and nightmares. So I went back to N.C’s house stayed there for 2 days. And I mean honestly being in that town was way better than being with N.C. But my dad called me saying how he was at the point of Suicide. So I fled with no explanation. Like yea my dad was abusive my whole life but he was all I had left. Then N.C and I broke up (not mad at that only mad at how i was treated) so I was stuck in that town. I was there for 2 months and I was so not myself I didn’t talk to ANYONE. I smoked hella weed and locked myself in a room. Then my dad and I came back home. Ended up homeless staying in an abandoned RV with no power or heat in the middle of winter. Now I have a job and I’m able to stay with a friend for 3 months only. And I’m trying to go back into therapy. I’ve repressed a lot of bad shit this year and I’m a fucking mess. Then what really set me off my friend I’m living with wants me to pay them in weed when I only got 8$ to my fucking name.  I’m scared of going manic again I feel it coming on and I’m trying to fight it as much as I fucking can.,1576741713.0,False,3,1,alex_420_catmom,None,ecq40z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/ecq40z/its_been_a_tough_year/
78,help?,"i know you guys aren’t qualified to diagnose me. but from your experience of living with bpd, could you please tell me if i’d meet the criteria for a diagnosis as i list my experiences and examples with the criteria standards. 

i also want to point out that i am currently isolated because i feel more comfortable within myself when i don’t have people in my life. 

1. Consistent feelings of emptiness- i don’t feel like a human being, i feel like an alien who is just existing most of the time. there is a sense of just feeling numb and nothing almost. if i could explain it, it just feels like there is a black hole inside of me and i don’t feel anything. 

2. Persistent and unstable self-image
i have never known who i am because of how often my mind changes. sometimes if i make up my mind about something, but i see someone arguing against my opinion, i’ll kind of rethink my opinion and side with them and tell myself i was wrong and they’re right. i feel like all i am is components of people’s personality and styles that i’ve stolen. for example, my career choices change a lot and very drastically. one minute i want to go into law and the next i see someone who works in the medical field and i begin to research the steps i’d need to take in order to do the same job as them. mind you, this would be a person online who i don’t even know, but i just like their content and i want their life. i also struggle with my own dress styles, for example; my ex had a sister who wore a lot of jewellery, so i went and bought the same jewellery and eventually adopted the same style as her, i would copy her music tastes and listen to the artists i knew she listened to and i could never understand why i did this. but since reading about bpd, i have acknowledged that i struggle have no sense of self. I will also mimick characters and their traits after watching a show, for example, i started to watch killing eve and then i would speak in a russian accent like Villanelle. I mimick Lorelai Gilmore a lot in terms of her humour and talking pace. 

3. Intensely unstable relationships
this is the first time i’ve been alone. i hate feeling lonely but love to be alone nowadays. i have been dating since 13 and i’ve been totally single with no male attention for almost a year. every relationship has been chaotic and i’ve been described as ‘unpredictable’ because my moods do not stay the same rarely ever, especially in romantic relationships, in terms of the constant arguments, being totally unable to believe what people say and trusting them, constant breakups, paranoid and anxious thoughts, such as believing they are cheating on me. i even go as far as stalking their social media accounts and creating a false story in my head about my partner and someone who they have on social media, and of course i believe the story although i don’t really have strong evidence to prove my case, and my behaviour shifts completely, i go from talking normally to my partner to being blunt and sarcastic which causes an argument. i also struggle with how i think about my partner and in all of my relationships, i have often ‘fallen in love’and felt like a happy little child with them, and feeling like this is a fairytale kind of love, to randomly hating them and wanting nothing to do with them. and the cycle continues. 

4. Repetitive suicidal thoughts, threats, gestures, or behaviors
i have always been attached to suicide. it never leaves my mind. i’ve been this way for so long. i constantly have the thought of killing
myself in my mind, but i do not want to die. i catch myself saying ‘i wanna die’ all the time and most times its for a silly reason, like me dropping my drink and it spilling everywhere. i have come close to suicide only twice. the first one i couldn’t find any pills to OD on, and the second time it was as if my reality became distorted. i had just finished arguing with my partner and was extremely upset by it and everything stopped and felt like a movie as i stepped past the yellow warning line near the train tracks. and suddenly it was as if everyone’s voice came swooning back in and it felt like i was back into reality. its not like i want to die, but i do at the same time. i plan my suicide and think about executing it at least twice a day. 

5. Energetic effort to avoid abandonment (imaginary or real)
in relationships yes. i have always tried to catch my partner out ‘cheating’ (ie. stalking their social media frequently checking for potential girls they could be speaking too and then piecing together a story that seems factual) so i can anticipate and prepare ahead. I have begged partners to stay, even if they’ve cheated, because i don’t want them to leave and i’d rather be in pain with them than without them. I continued to go back to my abuser because the thought of not having him broke my heart because i didn’t know who i was without him or what my life would be like. i have even let my abuser sexually assault me out of fear that he’d leave. i have stood in front of door ways to enable my partner to leave after telling him i wanted him to go, but i didn’t really want him to. 

6. Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling temperament
my anger has always been bad. i was an angry child and i was kicked out of school for fighting. now that im isolated, i don’t get angry a lot. i just struggle with the irritable feelings and anything can irritate me so fast, like the sound of people breathing or chewing sounds. sometimes when i hear my family speak i just get super irritated and can feel my body temp raising. 
in relationships, when something they do or say triggers me i get angry and i say things i don’t mean, throw things at them, and have tried to fight and had to be restrained. but attempts to fight is a rare occurrence. when i failed one of my exams, i was very upset and angry about it and i started to say things very irrational, i wouldn’t like to repeat what i said because i am still feeling guilty about it 

7. Sudden mood swings and emotional instability that can last hours or days
i’m very emotional and unpredictable. i will be in a pool of my own tears and ill cry for hours for no reason and then after i just won’t feel anything, but as soon as i see my siblings, i feel okay and somewhat happy? 
in relationships, i would be out with a partner feeling happy and suddenly i was irritated and just wanted to go home and not see them again. 
in relationships, i have found that i have had many conversations with a partner, normal conversations where i would basically treat them better than royalty and would do absolutely anything for them to suddenly feeling as if id be better off without them and how they don’t deserve me and i hate them and never want anything to do with them again, eventually to snapping out of it and feeling like i love them again.
 i was in college and had a meltdown in the bathrooms because i didn’t feel like i fit in. throughout college, i would just get outbursts where i had to cry uncontrollably, but afterwards i would feel okay. 
i find it quite hard to pin point my emotions so i guess i should start keeping a mood journal? 

8. Severe dissociative symptoms and paranoid delusions related to temporary stressors
When stressed, i isolate and withdraw from life itself. i dont attend education, dont speak to anyone and dont eat because i am too overwhelmed with the stress to deal with people. i just sleep. but when i am stressed and attempt to go outside, it is chaos. i just want to die and everyone that even looks at me i believe is going to follow me or harm me so i must move away otherwise its going to happen. my latest stress was caused by me spending money and not having enough to pay for the things that really matter, so i became stressed and tried to attend uni to ‘get some air’ but i didn’t attend my lectures i just sat in my toilets and cried for an hour and found myself in the middle of london walking around like a lost child. i do not remember how i got there. i just was. 
and when stressed and anxious about things like my cats, i feel the need to stay up all night monitoring my cats because i felt something was wrong with them so i had to be awake ‘just incase.’ i slept when i knew other members in my home were awake. 
when im stressed or upset and im outside, i feel like nothing is real and im almost unaware of my surroundings, and id just stare into thin air. people have seen me do this before and have told me it was as if i wasn’t present.   

9. At least 2 impulsive behaviors (for example: reckless driving, overeating, overspending, substance abuse, or sex)
Only overspending. 

I have been experiencing all of this since i was around 14/15. I am 20 now. 

For those who have this disorder, could you please help me because i am confused and don’t know whether i would qualify for a diagnosis or if it is just depression and unhealed trauma. I am planning on booking a doctors appointment soon 
but i am currently trying to battle the nerves because my mind is telling me im probably making it all up.",1710762488.0,False,2,2,Previous_Ad_7926,None,1bhorrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bhorrm/help/
79,Should I stay in my messy relationship?,"I've been diagnosed with BPD since I was 17 (I'm 24 now) and I've done a lot of different therapies for it. I thought I was getting better for the longest time because I thought I had my emotions and everything under control, especially in relationships. I've been seeing my boyfriend for roughly 2 years and I've noticed I've completely went off the rails. Any sense of emotional stability I've had before has completed disappeared. 2 years ago I was holding down a stable and really good paying job for 3 years and I think they liked me considering they trained me in every department and would always complement my work. I also had lots of friends and was very social, I even had friends that I was friends with for 9 years (there would be a few years in between where we wouldn't talk because of them moving or just different life pathways but always found our way back to each other). I also was in university and bought a car from the dealership and my credit score was really amazing too. I really felt like my life has direction at that point. That was until my dad got his second DUI and went into rehab and came out of rehab doing meth and completely flipping out. That's when I met my boyfriend. It was such a a rough time for me, I had to talk to the cops a lot and get a restraining order against my dad for awhile. My boyfriend was unlike anyone else I dated, he didn't try and force me to have sex and I waited awhile before hooking up with him, and even before we had hooked up he was there to support me through everything! I was so appreciative and really fell in love because I thought he was so compassionate. He had recently went through a break up so I had a sneaking suspicion I was a rebound and I just wanted to know where he and him stood. He promised me I wasn't a rebound and he hadn't talked to his ex for a few months. My BPD started flairing up and I went through his phone (I'm sorry I know it's bad but I developed this bad habit from my last ex being with him for a whole year and trusting him but seeing millions of girls messaging him till I finally had a hunch and checked and was mortified, I just didn't want to waste my time again) I found text messages between his friend and him saying that if he hooked up with me he'd basically be tunnel brothers with all his buddies (which is far from true, he thought I hooked up with both his friends but I only hooked up with his one other friend once when I was blackout at a party and I didn't even really want it to happen) it hurt my feelings to feel like he was talking about me like that to his friends and kinda made me feel like a whore. I ended up flipping and waking him up with a garbage bag full of his stuff and sent him home. We ended up talking it out and we started hanging again. But then whenever he got drunk, he'd call me his ex's name, and he called her and said he loved her and missed her. I was devastated once again, but now I felt like an easy rebound whore. So we once again fought and he convinced me it wasn't that way, just to go and hook up with her the one night I asked for space (he is extremely codependent). I was pissed and tried to convince myself I was done with him. But I'm stupid so I forgave him, I think I only did that because of all the trauma I was going through with my dad, I really wanted someone to be there for me and hold me and tell me everything was okay. He was back at my place again for awhile and then he disappeared to his ex's place for a whole week and swore on his life he didn't hook up with her and was just there to support her through a rough time (he only recently told me they did actually hook up). I spent the whole week crying at work and just being miserable. He begged me to stay with him and I did, which is something I've never done before. I've never ever ever let someone disrespect me like this before, but I felt so low and vulnerable. We were together for awhile after all that and it was so hard for me to not want to abandon him at any fight we had. We fought a lot and were pretty miserable together. I was really trying to break things off but he kept claiming he really wanted to be with me. He hooked up with a new girl he met and was hanging with secretly behind my back at his friends place for a month or two. What made me really mad is I would let him drive my car over there while I was at work and I bought an Xbox for him to use at my place and he was playing games with her while I was at work. Anyways he hooks up with her and she has BPD too. So off the hop she started tracking his location and everything, so he came clean to me about it and told me she was crazy and regrets doing it. I told him that he should just be with her and just leave me alone. She ended up needing help and he convinced me to go pick her up and help her get drugs. She ends up getting me and him into doing those drugs (we've done it before and were completely sober, just have a hard time saying no when it's right in front of me). We all ended up going on a 7 day bender and by the end of it I was all alone and the most mentally fucked I've ever been. They ended up dating. For a whole month he kept pressuring me to come over and give me drugs to drive them around and he even pressured me into a threesome. I only did it because I'm stupid and just did kinda want to be high and see him. They were absolutely vile to me while I was there and I finally got the back bone to block them and sober up. She would make millions of tiktoks about how she fucked him in the bed beside me to put me in my place and how she wants to beat me up now that I didn't want to be their bitch. She even threatened to send a whole gang of people to my house if I didn't send her money at one point. I was nothing but nice to her, swear on my life! She wanted to put me in my place because I warned her that he can be cheaty and to watch out! And she claimed I was trying to break them up. She still to this day posts about me and it's been a year since him and her were last together. Anyways, I was dating someone and doing shitty but alright. Sober, university drop out, bluey watching, chain smoking, loser on medical leave from work. My ex got me up and I dropped everything to meet up with him and to hear how shit his life was without me (hopefully) and it was. He GOT HER PREGNANT!!! And was absolutely MISERABLE! I was rolling. I wanted to laugh in his face and go back to eating cupcakes and watching bluey buuuutttt I self sabotaged my life and decided I wanted revenge on the girl for being a dick to me so I broke up with my boyfriend ( I held him back anyways, he deserves way better then a dumpster fire like me) and I hooked up with him while she was pregnant and behind her back and threw it in her face and then laughed at the tiktoks of her balling her eyes. I know I'm horrible, I really wasn't thinking right, I was kinda off the rails and sick of feeling like everyone gets to shit on me and have no repercussions, if I could go back in time I would have never met up with him. I didn't want to get back together but I ended up hooking up with him long enough that we did (the sex is the best I've ever had for some reason and he really makes me feel safe because of being there for the stuff with my dad). Getting back together with him made all my friends drop me, they were already mad at me for being too depressed and reclused for awhile.I was an ass to him though, constantly mad about him even being with a girl that was so cruel to other girls like that (even though I kinda was cruel to her by taking him back for revenge for all the shit she did to me). We were once again miserable together but I had quite my other job and now we were miserable and broke. my mom got us a job together and we started to work and save up for an apartment (I'm good at saving, he blew my money and his). I ended up having to borrow the money from my grandma for first and last ($3000, which I still have to pay her back for) I was also the only one allowed on the lease because of my good credit score and before we moved in, while I was working over time, he was looking at the girls onlyfans. Turns out he used his first paycheck to subscribe and look at her shit. It was a big blow up fight and he told me he only wanted to see if she was posting their videos they made together. We already had the apartment lined up so I forgave him and told him to just be honest with me and to never do it again. By that point I was so angry and resentful towards him, I was miserable everyday. He refused to cuddle with me or be affectionate with me at all or even have sex with me. I started becoming an angry violent alcoholic and we started to go at each other. I fucked his teeth up and he left me all bruised up. Our apartment was disgusting, he never helped me clean or cook or do laundry, he just played videogames and ignored me. He also brought his dog that he got with him and that girl together to our apartment and it wasn't house trained so it peed on everything. The dog peed on the couch I bought so much that I had to pay to throw it out. It peed on my Tv remote, laptop, bed and pillows, like literally everything. I dislike dogs because my parents would get aggressive rescues when I was a child that would attack me and I grew up to find them loud, obnoxious, and gross. I was the only one cleaning up after his dog. I found him on onlyfans again buying a bunch of girls content when he couldn't pay his phone bill that was in my name since he had no credit to get a new phone ( I got him a brand new phone and a phone plan), and he was even short on rent most of the time. He literally would beg them to meet up and everything. I was officially numb and done. I tried for a whole week to break up with him sobbing and begging for me not too, he begged me to give him one more month and I agreed. But then his dad died. I was such a a cunt to him though when his dad was dying because of the onlyfans stuff and I dislike dogs and his mom has 13 dogs and her house is covered in piss, shit, dirt, and dog hair. The dogs literally pee on everything. So I tried to support him from a distance, even though I drove him to the hospital and made sure to buy his dad blanket and slippers and soup when he couldn't eat the hospital food. But when it came time for us to wait out his death at his mom's place, I really didn't want to be there for him. I wanted to be able to come during the day but then spend the night at my parents place which was 10 minutes away. But he made me stay and we fought a lot. After his dad past, since we took so much time to take care of him we ended up losing our jobs. I instantly applied for welfare to make sure we could still pay rent, he on the other hand didn't. So I had to borrow money from my mom to pay his half of the rent. I also had to start going to the food bank and he refused to come with me even though I was anxious. I had to make him apply for welfare to help me because he refused to let me have my friends move in for us to be able to pay rent. Eventually I had enough and broke up with him and instantly hopped into a new relationship. I spent the whole month away from him anxious and feeling like shit, he was absolutely miserable and missed me and called me crying everyday. I ended up finding out I was pregnant with his kid (break up sex 🙄) and so I got back together with him and ended up  misscarry on Valentine's day, which was not my worst Valentines day lmao. But since getting back together he's made major improvements and swears on his life he wants to spend the rest of his life with me and I hates himself everyday for what he did to me. He has made major improvements but now I'm so broken and fucked up, I've become just like him when he was treating me like garbage. We had to move into his mom's place since my dad started doing meth again and I have another restraining order against my dad. I just feel triggered constantly at his mom's place. So should I even bother staying with him at this point? He has changed a lot, but now I'm extremely toxic and miserable.

80,I don't know why I have BPD,"this is very long and i dont expect anyone to read it, its basically a breakdown of my life and how i went from a good little christian kid to whatever the fuck is going on with my life now
my bpd confuses me. I've always joked that I've was born with a broken heart because during my childhood, I can't really remember anything traumatic happening to me and I had a good home life, yet I loved sad music and I remember being very young, like 3-4 and praying to God (I was just raised religious and I am a trans man and those things did not mix well even though I didn't realize my gender identity was the cause of a lot of unrecognized dysphoria that I thought was just due to the fact that I was chubby until I was a Junior in high school) to take me to heaven now whenever I got yelled at. In middle school I always felt left out and inadequate. In high school, I was not popular and was never once pursued romantically or had reciprocated feelings for any of my classmates. And although I wasn't bullied, my roommate (religious boarding school)freshman often snuck out of our room to go hang out with our other friend and I remember spending nights crying and wondering why I wasn't enough for her. I started experiencing depressive episodes during the winter and during my sophomore year I tried to seek help because it wasn't going away during the spring this time and was met with a ""you seem fine you've got that real Jesus joy in your heart"". and then junior year I went into a depressive episode that hasn't really seemed to lift completely to this day. I cut myself daily and isolated myself a lot and started gaining weight, something that I hated because I was already overweight and hated my body. I remember praying and crying and wondering why I was feeling like this and why this was happening to me. I viewed myself as lazy, worthless, unloveable, and a complete failure at the ripe age of 17. I lost my faith, my ambitions, everything. I also realized that I was bisexual and trans and this further worsened the depression because I knew my parents would not approve. I was hiding everything from them and trying to hold myself together and ""cure"" myself by using a horrible system of cutting myself for not completing chores/homework that I needed to complete but had 0 motivation or energy to do. I wanted to take my life, but before I could work up the nerve to I opened up to my parents about how I was feeling about everything about the LGBT stuff. they got me an online Christian counselor who helped but I was still dealing with the LGBT aspects of my issues because I was afraid of being kicked out of my school or being sent to conversion therapy. I knew I couldn't deny these aspects of my identity because I knew they were things that I couldn't change, the problem was that every single person in my life was, although most not aggressively, homophobic and transphobic. I saw a light of sorts at the end of the tunnel at graduation, and I figured if I could just make it out of high school and shatter the glass ceiling on my current life, then everything would be better. Senior year I took Lexapro and it didn't really seem to help, but I continued to take it. Unfortunately I gained more weight because of binge eating and was around 240lbs, not that much but I was easily one of the largest people in my school. I had an online girlfriend who told me she loved me and then later said she never meant it when we broke up. I started smoking cigarettes and weed and spent a lot of my time alone because half of the time when I tried to hang out with anyone I felt like I didn't really belong. I felt like a lot like I was on the outside of my own life and looking in. At this point I was also very bad and still am at taking care of myself, which I am very embarrassed about and am working on. I didn't shower as much as I should, I woke up with only 5 minutes to get to class, and really just kind of blundered through life because I was using all my energy on just keeping myself alive. Finally, I graduated, and things looked like they were getting better. I came out to my parents, and my previous good relationship with them tanked. things were weird, they acted like I was this whole new person but I still felt like I was just me. This hurt because of the obvious disapproval of the true me, in identity and opinions and personal values. this is still a source of contention with my dad mostly but I've learned to just tolerate his unacceptance of my gender identity. I felt alone and ostracized in my own house and college was the way I finally began to branch out into the real world. I met my best friend, began smoking weed daily which I think has proven mostly beneficial to me but I will not deny this may be problematic as well. I hung out with my new friend and then her friends who have become most of my current social circle daily and was never in the house. I took a break from college which turned into dropping out because I was changing career paths and found my passion in dog grooming, which was great. as I worked and had money to spend though, problems began arising. at this point I had started to feel somewhat out of control of myself, staying up too late before working in the morning, starting to do party drugs occasionally like Ecstasy, ect. while at home feeling like I was stuck in the past. I noticed that when I was out with my friends and living my own life, I was happy and although erratic and overly sensitive to feeling the need to belong and be inlcluded in everything, but as soon as i stepped foot through the door of my house i could feel my mood start to tank. I only even slept on nights when i worked in the morning. I felt the need to be able to do everything with my new friends and keep up, and i deeply needed them to like me. I was still unhappy with my weight, although beginning to like my appearance as i was able to present as my true gender. I am a hopeless romantic and have always wanted to settle down and get married. I had a lot of trouble finding love and felt unnattractive and undesirable. I also spent my money impulsively and was often broke and struggled to make it through a week on a part time paycheck. Because i spent so much time away from home and didn't have much money, I often skipped meals in favor of a pack of cigs or whatever random thing i was focused on. Because i was eating less and stiffled my appetite with cigarettes, i started to notice a loss of weight. I have never been athletic and especially now since i ran myself ragged constantly socializing or working, I've never consistently worked out or really seen any weight loss. So I started to skip meals on purpose occasionally and not just to save money. I desperately wanted to be skinny, something I've never been. It didnt get to be a problem until later when i really started to drop weight. First though, in late 2018 I met my current boyfriend and although it's only been about a year and a half, I'm certain he's the love of my life, and he feels the same. However, with all good things there are problems. He had a rough childhood and because of it has a lot of very difficult mental problems himself. At this point, i had stopped taking my meds after beginning walbutrin to combat how dull lexapro made me feel emotionally at times. I didnt like how irritable it made me and i barely remembered to take my meds anyways, and i was feeling elated with a new relationship and thought it was a good idea. i don't regret it because although i spiralled into a depression enough to admit myself to a hospital for a short while. They diagnosed me with bipolar 2 which didnt really seem to fit right since the hospital seemed to diagnose everyone with some kind of bipolar disorder and gave everyone abilify, the worst medication i have ever taken. Meanwhile, my boyfriend, B, was going through one of the worst mental health years of his life, and I tried to support him the best that I could. I definitely tended to ignore my own needs to help his objectively much more serious issues. I was also doing more drugs and just got a promotion from bather to groomer and had to transfer to a new store. I was very close to my coworkers at my first store but i didnt fit in with the other salon workers at the new location. I was feeling very out of touch with my social circle and extremely stressed out. Then one day, B had a very bad dissociative episode and didn't recognize me. I felt completely useless and pointless, especially since that morning I had also slept through my alarm for work; again. I remeber bursting into tears before getting my best friend, who i now lived with, to comfort B because I all I could think to do run. I then left the house and got into my car fall apart. I noticed Bs nightmare medication and zoloft, and without a second thought downed the entire bottle of prazosin and drove to a park. I then swallowed a handful of zoloft for good measure before i got a call from my best friend. When i got back to the house (god knows how i didnt wreck my car because i was definitely starting to feel the effects) They knew what was up immediately and then I was hospitalized for a second time, only a month after the first visit. Before my first hospital visit, I discovered one of my worst vices: cocaine. While i enjoyed other drugs, not counting weed, I didn't really care to seek them out on my own. But i fell in love with coke. i loved the way it made me feel physically, and finally the persistent exhaustion of being alive lifted and i felt like i could actually focus on something long enough to accomplish it. I was a nasty habit that gave me panic attacks, made me somehow even broker, and by the end of it I had gone from 240lbs to 160lbs since it made not eating even easier. I was also even more tired and irritated constantly. Thankfully my best friend had dealt with an eating disorder in highschool and called me out and helped me start eating better again. And then B and I tried meth. It was amazing, but it was also the fucking worst. We only did it twice, and the first time I personally only had a long, irritating comedown, but B dissociated so hard he thought he was 16 again for 3 days. The next time we did it i started to see things and have panic attacks at the thought of having to go to work in the morning. I called into work and that day we broke up because I wanted to get clean and he didn't. The next day we talked when we were clear headed we got back together, him now ready to quit too. I'm incredibly lucky that we got out when we did from meth because it would have destroyed us. Its something i still fear that I'll relapse into again, even though i dont really miss it except when I'm feeling especially dead inside. I told my mom about my drug use and this prompted a visit to a new psychiatrist who diagnosed me with BPD. It's nice to finally find a diagnosis that seemed to actually fit. I'm doing better right now, relatively. I found a medication that actually works, thank god for trileptal, B and I are mostly sober, the hardest thing we do now is acid every now and then, and we still smoke, just probably too much now. I've started DBT but had to stop because i got a new job and it didn't fit into my schedule, but now im on job number 3 of 2020 and its much more loosely scheduled so i can actually focus on my mental health for once in my life.
Anyways, the question I wanted to ask is I don't understand still why I have BPD. Everyone talks about how childhood trauama can ""cause"" it, and I know depression runs in the family, but not BPD. I come from a stable home where I was loved, although not really accepted but that wasn't until later on after my mental health started tanking. I feel guilty about it, and I can't help but think that I took a start for a good life and just shit all over it. I feel like such a family disappointment and I feel like im going to be stuck on this random, emotional rollercoaster forever and I'll just continue to destroy every good thing in my life. If i could pinpoint it to anything, I would think my roommate in freshman year sneaking out of our room might have been the start of the extreme fear of abandonment, but that seems like such a stupid, not traumatic or abusive at all thing to have caused me to go from who I was before, someone i can barely even remember what they were even like in terms of personality, to the dumpster fire ive become. Maybe theres some repressed memory of something happening to me, because I get asked if I was ever sexually assualted a lot, but I have no memory of anything like that ever happening and while I don't have a problem having sex mentally my body just doesn't seem to react that well to anyone other than myself. Maybe my brain chemistry is just that fucked that sometime as simple as a friend hanging out with someone else sometimes set it off. I just want to get to the root of the issue, any insight or if y'all also just want to spill your entire life story onto the internet feel free and I'll listen to you. Take care guys
tldr: I dont remember any trauma or abuse during childhood that would spark the BPD and I fear I may have some repressed memory or something, and I want to know why I have BPD so i can get better.",1589249403.0,False,5,6,dickfag69420,None,gi1w9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/gi1w9f/i_dont_know_why_i_have_bpd/
