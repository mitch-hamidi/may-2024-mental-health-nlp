0,"Medications are extremely subjective and what works for one person might not work for the other. The best advice is to speak to your psychiatrist. General practitioners can only offer so much and sometimes bpd can be treated with antipsychotics, however in a lot of places this is not something they offer easily.

0," 1. Personally mood stabilizers were the medications with least side effects i ever had to take. I take (lamictal - lamotrigine 400mg) and I’ve never had a side effect. But its better to talk to your doctor and see what would work for you. 

2. I’ve gone through many doctors who diagnosed me with things like severe anxiety and depression but it always believed i had something else that isn’t explained by their diagnosis. Until i found a doctor that i really felt comfortable with and liked her so much. I’ve seen her regularly for about 2 years now and it took her a year to diagnose me with bpd with therapy lots of tests (hormones tests, brain scans, adhd tests and  many other to eliminate other diagnoses). Also she took care of over all health like making sure i don’t have any deficiencies. 

Its a process but its worth it. When you find the right doctor and therapist for you it gets better and more comfortable 🫂💜",Informal-Loan3063,17sfn6l

2,The problem is some people do have depression and anxiety with bpd so doctors just rush through the first diagnosis which is terrible for patients. Like yes i do have them but thats not all. I’ve gone through 5 different doctors until i found one i really like mainly because she looked very deep for a diagnosis and did lots of testing and she usually takes care of my health in general and she told me even vitamin or mineral deficiency might mess me up emotionally so she monitors my overall health regularly. I know she is doing her job but i am honestly so grateful for her for doing it so perfectly. I pray and hope and wish you find a doctor that you are comfortable with cuz its the most important step. Sending you my hughs 🫂🫂💜💜,Informal-Loan3063,17sfn6l

Stopping medication straight away can be really dangerous. If your doctor said the hives weren’t caused by your meds, I would urge you to continue taking them.  

Judging by the content of your post, I would likely assume that the hives are a stress response, it happens to me often when I’m in high stress situations. 

I know right now it feels like you’re stuck and nothing will give you relief, but your stress responses will calm down over time. Just take it hour by hour and do whatever it is you can do to make yourself feel better. Your partner is in a safe place, and he needs you to be in an equally safe place. Psych holds aren’t forever, and once he’s been assessed etc, I’m certain they’ll let him call. It’s not a prison, they don’t wanna punish you. Just try and focus on you for a little while. If you need to cry, or scream or sleep for 20 hours, do it. Just treat yourself with kindness.",jaycakes30,1cs661z
1,"I just wanted to say, thank you so much for your response, it means the world to me genuinely. 

After a while of thinking about it more clearly, it does seem like the hives might be a stress response, today the hives were gone and I do feel slightly calmer so it’s likely to be connected. I do understand stopping medication can be dangerous, I’ve given it more thought and managed to get some sleep so I think I’ll call my psychiatrist again today and hopefully schedule something. 

I hope they do let him call but until then I’ll just try my very best to distract myself or sleep through this all. The emptiness and the separation anxiety is just really hard right now but I’ll do my best to stay away from anything he wouldn’t like me doing. 

Thank you again",missingmyfp,1cs661z

2,"(28F)I think I'm quite lucky to be surrounded by a community that (generally) supports mental health recovery and advocacy. There are always going to be people who judge anyone who takes 'a lot' of medication, regardless of whether it's for physical or mental aid. I used to be incredibly self conscious about sharing the fact that I take medication for my mental health, but the more I've spoken to people, the more I see theres a LOT of people who:
1. Dont carry judgement for people seeking medical help for a medical issue
2. Know someone close to them who is going through something similar
3. Feel more comfortable talking about their own issues having heard me share mine.

I have a friend who would take photos when her cocktail was changed — she had to put all the pills in a big soup spoon in order to take them efficiently, there were so many. She did ECT, she did EMDR, she did therapy with 24 hour access that she fully utilized. She slept for 36 hours at a time. She took meds that almost paralyzed her. But she did not improve.

I take four meds. I do well. I am extremely lucky. But so are you, regardless of how many meds it is that helps it to happen. Too many people live their entire lives searching desperately for relief and never feel its embrace. You should be proud that you did what was necessary to help yourself.

0,"This. So much this. It's hard because my boyfriend is so anti-smoking, but he *kind of* understands and begrudgingly lets me smoke.

1,"<sigh> I don't feel so awful for my habit, now. Thanks. I can connect with you 110% on this.

Sometimes when I feel particularly shitty about my self-medicating, as I smoke enough to be labeled a ""stoner,"" and there is definitely a ""stoners are dumb losers"" stigma, I think about how much positive research there is concerning medicinal marijuana right now and it makes me feel a bit better about it. 

You know what I just realized? I think smoking is when I practice mindfulness. There was a thread posted in one of the BPD subs recently about when we practice mindfulness, and I couldn't think of any particular times when I do, but I think that's part of why smoking is therapeutic for me. I was about to make a comment about how smoking particularly helps me when I feel like I'm about to slip into a dissociative episode, and I always just assumed that getting high just... interrupted my downward spiral and didn't give it much more thought. Well, it JUST dawned on me WHY the act is so helpful for me: I'm taking the time to focus on being in the present, I'm paying attention to grinding the bud, how it smells, how it feels, packing my bowl, making sure I don't spill, the heat of the lighter when I spark it, taking a nice, deep inhale and letting it all out... I'm practicing mindfulness. Now I REALLY feel better about my self-medicating!

Honestly, I don't think it's that big of a deal in the long run. The only part of smoking a lot that I struggle with is that it can leave me feeling a bit unmotivated, and I already struggle in that regard without any aid. I'm still trying to strike a better balance there, but I figure if I can get a better handle on my depression, I'll get a better handle on the motivation issue, too.

Either way, you're awesome. I definitely do not think you should feel down about yourself for this one.",ThisBorderlineLife,3gir98
2,"I self-medicate with weed too. I don't see why it's a problem - compared to psych meds, it's incredibly safe, low in side effects (and none are life-threatening), impossible to OD on, and there's no physical dependence. It's so much better for you than things like APs. Those are truly terrifying.",,3gir98
3,"It does the same for me - slows and quiets my thoughts, especially the negative and self-critical ones, and allows me to enjoy being in the present moment. For a while I smoked all day, but now I split a joint with my SO after dinner and a bowl right before bed... works wonders. 

I used to feel guilty about it but I honestly see it as no different from having a beer after work or a daily psych med. It's a little of both. And fuck, the actual doctors will give me Ativan, which is way more habit forming and addictive than weed. It's just the stigma.",,3gir98
4,"There was another borderline in my group therapy who smoked a lot of weed, and it really helped her.

Believe me, if I could get it easily, I'd be doing it too. I'd vape rather than roll joints, because fuck tobacco basically. But I can't. It's so unfair; alcohol is such a destructive drug and weed really isn't...but that's the one that's illegal?! Thanks, government.",,3gir98
5,"I used to smoke it too. Every single day. Some days it was the first thing I'd  do in the morning. It helped Shush the noise in my head (I know how nuts that sounds but I know people here will understand what I mean).

I can certainly see why people do it and although it's not physically addictive, I did become dependant on it to a point where I couldn't handle any kind of stress or emotion without smoking.

I quit a couple months ago cold turkey. Quit cigarettes too but use a vaper still. I miss it sometimes especially when I'm feeling particularly low or feel my emotions getting too intense. It helped me sleep too and I'm still struggling with that part. None of my doctors or therapists I'd ever seen agreed with my habit and I ended up having to lie to get them to stop haunting me about it.
I used to abuse valium/xanax and alcohol also. I quit all that and miss it sometimes too.

All I'd say in warning is we have very addictive personalities so try to limit it to the smoking and don't allow yourself to get to the stage where you can't function a few hours without it. Other than that I still believe it's a legitimately helpful drug when used correctly.

EDIT: And for the record, the way you spoke about the voices and you knowing they were you and the sort of things they say... all that could've came from me word for word and is exactly why I smoked weed too! Makes me feel not quite as crazy knowing someone else has the exact same problem with their thoughts.",Insert_Non_Sequitur,3gir98
6,"I'm not sure what the issue is here. Marijuana is a multipurpose medication with incredible effectiveness for some people. I also use alcohol & drugs to self medicate so that I can take a break from myself and be more capable in my life. It makes me a more effective and functional person, the same way that my ex's anti anxiety meds do for her. 

If your medication came in pill form prescribed by a doctor, would you be worrying about it so much? Or would you accept it as a treatment for a chronic mental health condition, the way that some people use antidepressants or mood stabilizers? 

And yeah, all the thoughts that insist on detailing all of the cringeworthy or unpleasant experiences of my life, or the constant internal narrative of self loathing are why I'm always busy doing stuff or distracted with media. I hate being alone with my thoughts. You're not alone.

Oh, don't get me started. Prescribing naltrexone to block the ""pleasure""/relief of self-injury? If it works, then the person is likely doing it at least in part for the endorphin release. We know the opioid system is messed up in BPD. Anything else would be treated by supplementing whatever it is the person is deficient in. ",,3gir98

I hope you’re doing okay and haven’t done anything yet.

I know exactly how you’re feeling. This just happened to me too, 2 weeks ago. 

I wish I could give you amazing advice and some secret to making it all stop... my therapist did talk to me about doing things that release the same endorphins to  do that instead of hurting ourselves. Breathing deeply I guess does it! Running, exercising... I’m not sure what else to be honest. On my own post somebody suggested holding ice cubes (I can’t do this because of health reasons). Or using a rubber band on your wrist to snap. Somebody suggested sharpies and drawing where you’d cut... I don’t suggest this personally. I thought it was a great idea so I did it but then I ended up writing very hateful things on myself and though THAT night it helped me get to bed, the next night I ended up cutting and worse so I think because I still had stained skin of all these hurtful things and it just fueled me. 

Side note: I’d highly suggest trying something else for an anti-depressant! Every time I switch/stop my anti-depressants I go through exactly what you’re going through. It sucks, but finding the right one is vital. I used to take Citalopram and it was my favorite one feeling wise it stabilizes me the best - but I had physical side effects that made it impossible for me to continue taking it 😭",kulia808,gi0ltn
1,Antidepressants and bpd are a weird one. I tried 4 meds over the last 5 years and they all had dissociative effects that were super bad except the Effexor which is really helping me.  The first time I tried an antidepressant I left my house without telling my roommates for a week and broke in (with permission) to a friends empty loft apartment while he was out of town. I didn’t tell anyone where I was and just stayed at his place for a week with no food.,,gi0ltn
2,It sucks so bad. I can’t tell either if I’m reacting normally or if it’s because my health is so messed up.

But that's why communication is important. If they're willing to attempt to understand, I would try to explain it until they can at least understand even a little bit. 

Before being officially diagnosed I studied my symptoms starting back in middle school. My now deceased wife (passed of cancer) helped me a lot. She saw me at my absolute worst and still chose to be with me. I was able to talk to her about anything. It got to a point she'd be able to detect one of ""outbursts"" before it happened and helped me through. I learned a lot of coping skills and am a lot calmer of a person because of her. Currently, I have one friend I trust enough to talk to. 

If you have someone you can trust, my advise is talk to them about things. Even if all they do is listen. It helps. I've also found that being open about my condition helps me and helps others understand me. So I've recently started a podcast where I talk about my life and different situations I've been through as well as how I feel about certain topics. Even if I never grow an audience I'll continue doing the podcast because it's a way for me to get things off my chest (vent) and I'll be able to listen to episodes in the future to see how much I've changed compared to when I spoke about a situation and how I might handle it differently as opposed to when I went through it. 

I chose podcasting on purpose because I feel a blog would gain an audience faster, and whereas I do want to talk about it and put it out there, part of me is still a bit scared or nervous about how some people may view what I say. But either way, it's an outlet for me to relieve my stresses and vent; which does help.",RedConradcom,14h1jz1
1,"Hey, no matter what your symptoms and experience - you aren't alone! Remember that. 

BPD is complex, and every case is uniquely formed and expressed. People - including doctors - would often downplay my mental illness because I'm more of the ""quiet"" subtype with a high functioning presentation. It was misdiagnosed for many years because of that in combination with my not having an obvious history of abuse. But trauma is much more complicated than that. Having our mental illness and experience invalidated of course contributes to the overall issue.

If you meet the criteria, or even some of the symptoms that severely affect you, then they need to be addressed no matter what anyone thinks. No matter your situation, yes, your brain HAS been wired a certain way by your environment and experiences. And it can be rewired in time. DBT is a great place to start - if you can't do it formally, there are many books and resources online. I'd also highly recommend Dr. Daniel Fox's YouTube channel, as well as his Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook. His workbook is pretty unique compared to other ones out there; it's my favorite one I've come across. I'm going to be starting my own channel soon, but more for the peer support side and to share my personal experience with BPD and recovery - I'm not a doctor or licensed in any way and will still suggest there that people refer to his content for clinical information.

BPD is an isolating experience, but that's why peer support is so important. I haven't felt understood regarding the strength of my emotions by anyone in life besides those with similar issues. Keep reaching out. BUT be wary about info you come across, even within this subreddit. There are so many misconceptions, and they can be harmful to recovery. Have hope. I promise things won't always be as they are currently as long as you keep working towards change. 

And congrats on being free of sh for so long, that's fantastic and you should be incredibly proud of yourself!",SarruhTonin,14h1jz1

What helped me more than any single thing was actually Buddhism. It's weirdly similar to DBT in many respects, and is so so useful for skills and framings outside of any spirituality. I started by listening to podcasts while taking walks after work. I can make recommendations!

Otherwise, not having friends feels terrible. It's so gd common though. It's like everyone feels lonely but no one seems as though they do. Think about the friendships you started but may have let fade! I bet they'd be happy to hear from you :)

The forgiveness, the kindness, the gentility, the care, and the compassion, the love we give ourselves is paramount if we are to heal and find some sort of internal peace. Nobody said it was easy, and fighting on is tough when you just want to be free of daily emotional pain and conflict. Again, hope and being kind to ourselves we must strive for.

So not only are you having to care for a little human and teach them how to be the best they can be, you’re having to teach yourself these things too. And some days, it’s so hard not to emotionally react or react to things in a negative way, but you have to remember to apologize to your kids when you do, even if they are little bitty and explain why it was wrong. I also get SUPER overstimulated relatively quickly, so some days are absolutely draining and it feels like my kids are attacking me and my mental (kids are just really fuckin good at knowing how to press your buttons).

You're doing everything you possibly can to better yourself, and if she can't see that, she can get lost. Our brains make us believe that this is it and that we are inherently unlovable, we will never achieve happiness - but we can, we do, and we will.

1,"you sound like you really care about him and are also very self aware about your patterns and symptoms which is good. i completely relate to this as someone with bpd, the introspective kind, and i have more of a problem with over empathising and disregarding my own needs. because of how i grew up, im a lot more likely to walk on eggshells to keep the peace than to blow up and say or do things ill later regret. this means a lot of my needs go unnoticed unless i consciously speak up about them. a fair few if not most of my bpd episodes arise from fear of abandonment which is brought up when i feel as though one or several of my needs are being ignored, when in reality often times, i just haven’t communicated them. id say try and understand what you need from him and then tell him, as well as asking him what he needs and wants from you! from experience both living with bpd and loving someone with bpd-like episodes, usually all it takes to deescalate a conflict is an open, kind conversation where we both listen to each other and speak gently until we understand each others point of view and why the argument arose in the first place. the fact that you are asking how you can be a good partner is a good sign that you have the capability to be one! something ive learned is that staying silent and suppressing yourself because you think it will make you a better partner will not do the relationship any good. sometimes setting boundaries is very difficult if you’re used to ignoring yourself to stay safe, but once you are with a safe person, setting boundaries and speaking up about what you need from your partner is integral for a healthy connection so everyone feels heard and cared for and there is no built up resentment from lack of communication. good luck to you and your boyfriend and remember that while it’s great that you care so much about others, you also deserve someone who will listen to you and love you without you having to make yourself smaller 🫶🏻",shawdybroken,1aw2hgb

If I ever notice an anxious thought about my partner cross my mind at anytime, I notice it, think about it, remember they are a person who deserves respect, and fully try to put myself in their shoes. If they say something that makes me feel hurt, I say I need a minute, leave the room and remember they aren't trying to hurt me. They didn't wake up planning ways to make me feel upset, they are simply a person with many complex thoughts and emotions of their own. Obviously this takes a lot of time to start working, I still have many times I lose control and can't stop words coming out of my mouth. I definitely reach a point of clarity faster and do it less though. 
Taking time to stop throughout the day to do check-ins. Remind yourself you're currently safe, your partner is trustworthy, your partner is also a complex person, and your partner loves you.

7,"I'd suggest looking into DBT and CBT techniques, as well as grounding exercises. They can be super useful for managing stress and emotions.

The thing that actually helped me while practicing CBT and DBT is keeping myself busy, especially with the right and most beneficial things:

Consider trying out different hobbbies, even if you think you might lose interest in them later on. You can always try something new.

Try working out, or just joining classes like Pilates or spinning once a week at first .

Something i can also suggest is taking free online courses on topics that pique your curiosity can be incredibly rewarding and can be added to your CV.

One thing i do personally is that I make it a point to research any topic that catches my attention or that I'm not well-informed about. It could be as simple as looking up word definitions or diving into a whole study on a planet i once heard about in a tiktok video .

And when it comes to doing things solo, I recommend giving it a shot. Eating out alone can be a surprisingly enjoyable experience.

Pet sitting can also be a nice experience.

I'm glad that you have a good support system. I'm quiet BPD too and it's not easy. Nobody even remotely understands us and there's such a strong stigma.


Would you say your suicidal thoughts appeared around the time you got your diagnosis? It happened to me with autism and it was (is) horrible. 


When it reaches that point, I generally don't involve my close social circle, I ask the psychiatrist for an emergency meeting (sucidal ideation can be a side effect of the treatments) so that they can readjust, and of course request an emergency session with my therapist. I'm not sure what yours have you on at the moment but sometimes a small increase in dosage or adding a new molecule has been a life saver for me.

I know if I ever have children of my own, that I would try my best to be there for them and listen to them. I basically plan on using my mom as an example of what not to do.

Though they won’t diagnose children (at least where I am ) The one with BPD is highly quantitatively gifted. So you never know what you will get with neurodivergent kids!! My kids make my life a million times better. I truly value them and they have taught me so much. Being a mother is about sacrificing, your body, time, energy, and emotions. Balancing motherhood is a delicate balancing that has brought me enormous joy. If you are in a good financial place with a good support system you can easily get resources for yourself and child. 

Now the bad side is all of the joy comes with lack of sleep, unexpected illnesses/disabilities, breastfeeding or formula feeding, possible milestone challenges. Rising cost of raising children, child care is crazy expensive if you need it. Then they need iPads, computers, clothing, extra curricular activities. You have to be ready to travel with them. I personally don’t travel with babies under 3years old too much work. Then it’s family friendly places. Your friends can change, your body may or may not go back to before. Life will continue to happen, your child will not be perfect. You won’t be perfect. 

Being humble and able to apologize as a mother is really important. Your children need to see their mother happy. You need to be able to reflect back your children’s emotions so they can become healthy adults.

0,"Hey.
I’ll start by saying that it’s good you’re setting boundaries and receiving continuous professional support. I would stick to what your therapist suggests rather than what your partner has said concerning medication etc. I can confirm that there aren’t really many medications than can help with a BPD mind. People often equate it to something like anxiety or depression (as these are common symptoms for us and can be treated with meds) But if anything, I think BPD is more akin to something like being on the spectrum. It’s more just that our brains are wired differently at a core level. I usually find explaining it this way to those who don’t understand BPD helps a bit more. 
It does sound like your partner has some problematic behaviours, and it’s worth taking the time to think about whether they’re open to working through them, and whether you’re up for standing by them whilst they do. Outburst of anger are a big no for me, but you may be someone who handles that stuff well.  We can’t really tell you whether you should end it or not, that’s down to you. I guess it’s all about balance and protecting your peace. If they’re making you feel worse, then it may not be worth continuing the relationship x",Accomplished_Funny51,190iwrf

1,"First of all, it's important to recognise that there is a huge difference between symptom-free and being well enough to live a life where your symptoms are manageable and you can be happy. Forget the thirty years and focus on this year - what is affecting you the most right now? Take that to therapy, take the meds, and try to keep you mind on now. Mindfulness can be helpful with this - there are loads of free resources on YouTube as well as apps like Headspace.

Secondly, it's very difficult (and I would say unethical personally) to put a number on recovery. Different people respond differently to treatment and some people commit to therapy and making changes more than others. You could speak to a different medical professional and get a very different answer. That's not saying that you shouldn't listen to your psych, *you absolutely should follow their advice*, but don't let that number stop you from committing to treatment or give up hope because of it. Take it one day at a time.

Educate yourself first and then teach your friends ways they can help you personally and then be willing to be helped! 

bpd is a highly varying disorder n the most you can do is try to make sure people understand the most important symptoms for *you*. 
For me it’s my black and white thinking. I imagine this is the same for a lot of us but I’ve noticed this has been the hardest thing for my friends to understand. Teaching people that I struggle to work with grey areas or even acknowledge them sometimes was initially really hard but over time people have started being super helpful w my emotional range, emotional threshold and my general social ability. 

My FP/BF and I have worked on it HEAPS and he’s been super patient w me without compromising his own boundaries (which is super important for people w BPD to stay conscious of!). He’s been rly good w reminding me when I’m freaking out for no reason in a gentle and kind way.

Before we had a way of communicating w each other he often felt overloaded by my emotions n v often felt like he had a lot of pressure on his shoulders. Teaching him what an FP was and explaining the intensity of that scared him a lot and we had to find new ways to discuss my mental illness in a way that didn’t make my mental health feel like his responsibility!

It’s not a medication that works right away. It takes about 3-6 weeks for the medication to start working. Be patient with the medication and be patient with yourself.

The medication I'm on also has very few side effects, so I don't feel like there's a negative trade off for me, other than the negative feelings I sometimes get about needing them.

One note I want to make is that sometimes it may take a while to find medicine that works well for you. So if you do decide to try it and it doesn't seem to work, don't give up! Also, if there are any particular side effects you're worried about (for example, I wasn't okay with weight gain or a risk of high blood sugar), make sure to tell your doctor and they should work with you.

I would sit and  repeat and contemplate  things  like neuroplasticity (the whole process) and cortisol's impact on the brain & how that can lead to mental illness. Facts. I would repeat and meditate on facts. I'd repeat CBT methods to myself as well as other ways of repairing cortisol damaged parts of the brain. I'd think about and repeat to myself ways of repairing neural pathways that were thinned out and how they worked. I meditated on these facts over and over because I wanted to give less resources to my emotional neural pathways. It worked like a charm. I also spent that whole month doing new things to stimulate new neural pathways. To be honest, it needs maintenance and since I haven't kept it up, I've been a bit much to handle still.

Self-awareness about the *reason* you struggle with motivation might help too.

And crying. Big, long fights with my parents. 

So I decided to stop framing it that way. Reframing was huge for me for this - maybe reframing the tasks may help? I also put on Sims music while I'm cleaning so I feel like a sim - it helps take me psychologically out of the task and pretend like I'm just a machine algorithm completing a task, and I'll do something else when I'm done.

0,"I don't know that either of these 2 points will bring you real comfort but

People with borderline have had physician assisted deaths in countries where that is offered. May be no surprise.

Second is that DBT is designed to recognize that life is not always ""worth living"", and feeling as you described may be a life that's not ""worth living"" (why else would you be desperate for escape?). One point is to focus on that reality and risk , managing to cope with new tools while building the relationships, meaning and habits that can sustain a life you chose.

I can't say why your psych tells you ""you're doing well"", whether it's communication on your part, or perhaps just the limit of their validation and awareness. The fact you were previously on 5 medications at once is a small concern and maybe suggests that wasn't right care for you; in general fewer meds= better recovery for pwBPD. I can't assume you have access to other care providers or treatment programs, but possibly a higher level of care, partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient would fit; or a different treatment approach would be a better match for you. You find the group setting increases your anxiety and emotional avoidance or dissociation?

3,"Hi, Thank you for your thoughtful reply. 

I think my psychiatrist thinks I'm doing well compared to how I am when I'm admitted as an inpatient. I'm not sure that's a very fair benchmark though. I feel like she thinks my current level of suffering is acceptable because it's presenting as an improvement on where I was before. But it's always going up and down and honestly, even with the few moments where my mood is at its best, it's still not worth the remaining 99% of the time which seems to range from extremely difficult to absolutely unbearable.

I wasn't able to leave the house, but now I can sometimes with immense distress and difficulty. I'm still having crazy mood swings that I can barely manage. Just because I'm not aggressively trying to kill myself all the time and dont require constant surveillance doesn't mean I'm doing better enough to be left without help. She's refusing to prescribe any more medications because of the bad reactions I've had but honestly I would try anything at this point, even more bad drug reactions if it meant that this was not the level of normal I would be settling with for the rest of my life. I just feel like as long as I'm not immediately going to kill myself, that seems to be good enough, which seems cruel and disappointing. As things are, I don't know how much longer I can survive like this. 

I cycle through these suicidal loops so often that when I come out, I know I didn't really want to die, I just wanted to know that there was a possibility of a way out.

I don't want to say the cliched line 'I'm sorry you're going through that' which seems to be the standard automated response to someone sharing their pain, because it never makes me feel any better.

We don't need to be going through the exact same thing but just being able to be honest about how terrible things are and meeting in the middle through our mutual suffering is enough. I don't want to minimise how unique your situation is, but I will say that I definitely share a sense that I'm living purely out of obligation to my family and also that it feels pretty much impossible for me to feel any positive emotions, enjoy anything or relax completely without self-judgment, fear or paranoia setting in.

0,"Hey. I’m in the U.K. so can’t help with therapists in your area etc, but the ones you’ve seen sound appalling, and shouldn’t be practising. 

I have various personality disorders and PTSD, and yes, I probably will be on medication for the rest of my life (I’m 34 now and I started when I was 16). To be honest, I can’t even imagine life without them. They make me better. Why would I stop taking something that makes me better? Work on removing that medication stigma, and try to accept that medication can be a good thing.

Everyone is having a horrible time at the moment, and I think it’s especially hard for those of us with mental illness to endure. We’re lonely, claustrophobic, anxious, and some of our coping strategies have been removed. It’s natural that you’re feeling extra poorly at the moment. Let yourself accept that things are going to be really rubbish for a little while, but don’t forget that this will end. And you will have good days again.

I was very lucky around six or seven years ago and was offered ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy), and it changed my life. I still struggle, of course. I bloody posted here last week because I cut myself! It was the first time in two years, though, and of course I’m struggling with the lockdown like everyone else. But on the whole, it has allowed my recovery. It’s very peculiar because it forces you to lean into your trauma and accept it, rather than fight it (which is what we’ve spent all our lives doing, right?). But it works. There’s also a programme here called STEPPS which is used for those with PDs who aren’t as far into their recovery. Have a look into both these therapies/programmes and see if someone near you might offer them (when lockdown is over).

Growing up and before getting diagnosed with my own stuff, I really enjoyed researching the shit out of things that interested me. Mental health being one of them. I knew something was up with me very early on and THANK GOODNESS for the internet because before all this met neutrality went down and internet life was actually bearable and relatively “fresh”, I was able to explore my mind and wackiness through research and actually allowing myself to feel and think the things I did. I just didn’t tell anyone. I’d read, watch videos, and ask google more and more to kinda get a sense of what I was going through, for my own peace of mind... because if I at least understood and accepted what I was going through, than that’s okay and enough. Because no one actually knows what we’re thinking or feeling unless we physically and vocally do so.. 

It became my own sacred secret. And that was okay and is okay for me because I also learned fairly quickly that the human condition alone is a very complex one, let alone one that is naturally made with an imbalance (which is also okay), so I’d just have to make sure that I was keeping it in check the best way that I could without letting fear, shame or guilt get in the way. 

Granted, that’s a bit harder now with having to grow up and transition to full blown adulthood. But it’s a great concept and sort of “light” to look to. You are who you are because that’s how youre biologically made. But you get to decide how you treat yourself and how you want to show up in your life, day to day. Even if it’s something unique each day. Just as long as you  work towards building a balance, a blue print to how you yourself need to survive and thrive. 

That includes letting go and REALLY not giving a fuck about what people think about you. Do what’s right for you so long it doesn’t hurt anyone or offend anyone. 

Honor yourself. Love yourself with your flaws and all. Because at the time of death that is all we have, ourselves. 

You have FULL reign over your body. Over your mind. Over your heart. Just because it’s been a tough fight, doesn’t mean you’re going to lose. 

Idk if you watch Naruto or anime at all, but if there’s one think I’ve gotten so far from Naruto is that each day, each moment brings a new challenge. Whether it be mental, physical or spiritual. Whether we’re ready or not, equipped enough or not. The important part is to show up and fight. Give your best and your all, regardless if you win or lose. 

Life is a win/lose game. It’s a matter of what we learn from it and how we use it to keep going. Because dude, as crazy as some days may feel living with this, we also experience some pretty dope amazing things! That wouldn’t be the same if we were normal! 

Kinda like Hannah Montana too 😂 best of both worlds! 

Make the most out of it love! Even if it hurts like fucking hell sometimes. It’s okay. We don’t like a lot of thing, but we still get through it because we have to. 

Don’t be afraid or ashamed. You’re you and you are trying! And that is enough!

Also, don’t give up on trying to find a good match in terms of healthcare and therapy. I’ve yet to find a good match, and even though it’s made things relatively worse in some aspects, I don’t wanna give up. And you shouldn’t either. You deserve to live a full life.",betsyletsy,fxe0xe

You’ll also have to be doubly cautious about self care, be conscious about sleep, water, etc. if you have this added stress, you need to strengthen yourself as much as possible. 

Be mindful about what stress you are experiencing. Is it something that is your stress or are you picking up the stress from other people? Be conscious about that. Don’t beat yourself up for feeling their stress, but don’t take responsibility for it either if that makes sense.",1life2blived,bav1sm

0,"I'm bipolar with bits of BPD.  I've been medicated for the bipolar for over a decade but recently switched my meds up a bit and it seems to be helping with some of the BPD. I also did weekly therapy for two years that helped and made a mental list of ways to handle intense emotions. Some things that I've found help are running, writing, painting and watching TV. Also, allowing myself to have emotions and knowing that they will pass is incredibly helpful. Romantic relationships are problematic for me and I can't see myself being in a functional one right now. However, I feel like I am getting better about feeling abandoned which is good. I'm starting DBT soon (just got off the wait list) so hopefully that will help.

tl;dr meds help some, therapy helped me a lot and finding an outlet helps.",sillygoosegirl,3szkhu
1,"I'm BPD with Bipolar II-though I'm not quite sold on that second diagnosis yet. The DBT waiting lists around here are all 2+ years, and I definitely don't have the money for private therapy. What I've found the most helpful is 1-being single. Which sucks! I've been a chronic 'serial-reltionship(ist)' for my whole life, and it always stood in the way of getting better. Being single allows me to go through the wild ups and downs without taking it out on anyone, and without the guilt that causes. 2. I'm currenlty on 900mg Lithium and 300mg Wellbutrin, with 1 mg Lorazepam as needed. It took awhile for my psychologist and I to find the right meds and doses that work for me. And lastly 3. I've done so much research on BPD I could start my own library. I've got most of the books on the topic, have seen every documentary, have done all the DBT self help workbooks, and have even taken a 'loving kindness' course at a Zen Buddhist centre, as Zen Buddhism is a big part of DBT. With all that said, it still isn't easy-but it is easier than it used to be. I think for myself, I'll always 'backtrack' a bit when I'm in a relationship, it is a disorder of emotions and emotional connection.",jagersthebomb,3szkhu

3,"If you have a good relationship with your mom now, maybe you can do some things together? 

  I'm not sure what kind of exercises you do but workout videos or dance videos on YouTube can be fun to do and you don't really think about exercising but having fun.  If you have a smart TV there should be a YouTube on there or your smart phone should be able to screencast on a TV. 

  Or maybe a bike ride together? 

It's rough but avoiding telling someone how you feel can build up so I guess maybe tell her directly how you feel?   I'm kind of going through a similar situation and telling her how I felt made me feel a little better just to say it out loud to her (even though she ignored me). 

  Or put in headphones and just focus on the music when you're doing something for yourself.

0,"I can tell that you genuine love your partner and I'm really happy you want to help.

First and foremost, if you want to be there for him, you need to be understanding and have a lot of patience like never before. Some may argue that you're his girlfriend not his punching bag or that you're not his therapist BUT THE THINGS IS WE DIDNT ASK FOR THIS EITHER. That's the number one thing. Never expect a person with bpd to be able to rationalize or not get carried away with their emotion because that's asking them to act normal a.k.a without bpd. So whenever he is in an episode, you need to figure out if he's the type that needs space or the type that you need to be pushy with. As his girlfriend, Im sure you know him better.

Next, we have a black and white mentality, an extreme one, and it can always change or be two things at once (the term is ""splitting""). Do you get me here? For example, there are times when Im so affectionate to my boyfriend but a single wrong statement or action (no matter how small) will turn the switch from ""god, i love you and i wanna marry you"" to ""i hate you so much. I knew i shouldn't have been in a relationship with you. I need to leave you asap. Good bye. Let's break up."" One way of dealing with this is to assure him that you understand, and overwhelm him with your love depending on his love language (actions, material, words, etc.) My boyfriend always gets me back to myself whenever he kisses me passionately or buys all the food I love haha. It's simple things like that which can mean a lot. 

There may be times he'll seem distant or want to break things up. Please know he DOESNT mean it. He's just having an episode. Assure him you're not going anywhere. In this situation, you're gonna have to learn from experience on which is the better route: talking to him until he's out of the episode or give him space until he comes back and apologizes. Which, judging from your post, is what he does. This will happen LOTS of times and I ask you to not get tired of it, please. And never doubt yourself or take it personally. My boyfriend used to blame himself or ask me if his love isnt enough and it broke my heart. Never ever take it personally, please. And never show your partner that you take it personally because later on, this will be a baggage for them and become another reason why you'll be better off without them.

That's all I can say for now but please dont shy away from asking advice or anything. You can tell me specific situations you need help with and I'll happily help out. Having bpd is so exhausting and destructive, which is why I admire people who actually loves us. Im here for you both.",bpdgal,eo07oc
1,"Holy shit, a lot of that is so similar to how he is too! That’s crazy! He will sometimes snap in a second from I love you to, him being the complete opposite over things that are small to me but big to him. I’ve been with him three years, and I do see how patience has always always helped. Yesterday, we were fine and cuddling and then I said something about going home so my family can take care of me (I’ve been sick the last couple months and been staying with him as he takes care of me, I feel guilty bc he spends his own money on medicine and shit for me since I haven’t had a decent pay check in months) and I wanted to get that stress of paying for my stuff off of him. He completely changed got really mad and I just reassured him I understood it was okay and I gave him the chance to just let all his emotions out. Then everything was fine again and he apologized. He always does, he will always feel bad about it later. There was another time he just needed space over a year ago and that was hard on me but I let him just do him for a few weeks until he texted me saying he needed me and missed me and stuff like that. It seems he feels over whelmed a lot with human interaction. He also gets tired of his best friends and family. Sometimes he will say he just wants to go away from everyone and start over. It hurts but I know it’s something he can’t really help. It does make it easier knowing it is BPD and that he’s not just doing this by choice if that makes sense. It’s hard I don’t really talk about it to those close to me bc from an outsiders perspective he’s “not a good bf” but he is. He always has been. He’s so sweet, and loving, and gives me the world. Even with his episodes, I feel like I’m rambling here lol. Your comment just kind of opened my eyes a little more. Some things that have happened between us make more sense now. I will continue to be here for him, and not take it personal when he gets how he gets sometimes. Thank you so much",sadcrock,eo07oc

I'm not trying to be a jerk, I just want to make sure we're using the same terminology.  


Regardless of your illnesses, what this all comes down to is triggers between the two of you. Do you know what they are? How do you cope in certain situations? What kind of techniques do you use to self-soothe? You mention he's on meds; are you on meds? Are either of you seeing a therapist? If he's in a bad spot, can you support him even if that means you might be triggered and could send you spiraling? Can he support you?  
 

Having a relationship with a normal joe and someone whose crazy is hard. When you have two crazies, it's even harder because its a constant check and balances. And while relationships can be hard even if you're ""normal,"" you're easily looking at twice the work when mental illness is involved. If you think he's beyond worth it and could be someone see a future with, make the commitment. And not to say he's ""too much,"" but if you feel you cannot support him if he relapses or if there are too many risks involved, let him go.   


And if you decide to stay, get couple's therapy even if you think you don't need it.

2,"What an amazing reply!!! And not a jerk at all! Thank you so much. Sorry, yes I do mean Borderline Personality Disorder. I get confused with acronyms lol! I agree it is something that needs to be weighted. Especially as we have children on either side to take into consideration. I am medicated on Concerta and Mephylenidate. Which has seen an awful amount of my impulsive and emotional behaviours balance out. So, I would say I am the more level headed out of the two, well as much as an ADHDian can be. 
I am triggered by violent episodes around me, I am noise and smell sensitive. One occasion I jumped out of a window during an argument years prior to meeting my ex. The noise vibrates through my skull and feels like physical torture. Although my ex is like a hot Brian Blessed (loud no matter the mood) it wasn’t until I bought up missing money did his voice become even louder and more aggressive in tone. So, that’s my trigger. His trigger from what I can gather is his addictions being found out (gambling and cocaine), he had lied for months about needing money which me being me was like a walking bank. Then when I pulled my funding (don’t want to be an enabler) he became even more defensive. So less about the addictions and more about the need to lie. Coming from a background of mental health I would like to think I can understand him and his motivations. I lie too when I have been impulsive on Amazon and it has taken a lot of therapy to be honest not just with others but with myself. Couples therapy sounds like an awesome plan, I already have a therapist for my ADHDitude but I wonder if he will think this is an attack on his feelings? How are you and your husband now? I really appreciate the reply and it has definitely given me plenty to think about. I honestly believe that someone with borderline personality disorder is more than worth the effort.

Whether you believe me or not, that right there is a huge step in the right direction.  There is no 100% miracle drug and there are non-medication-related changes that are critical if you want to heal.  

One of those changes is learning to just be okay with yourself.  Try to notice when you're beating yourself up and find something to distract you.  Then focus on trying to accept yourself as you are.  You're not good, you're not bad, you're just you.  After awhile, it becomes habit.

But a lot of what you described growing up and how your felt is how I felt.

I'm sure I have BPD but I haven't been diagnosed. I've been misdiagnosed bi polar also but always knew that was wrong because my mood swings are caused by outer circumstances not chemical imbalance and because my sister is bi polar so I've seen manic episodes and I don't have those.

1. consistent feelings of emptiness -  i feel this way as well, constantly.
2. persistent and unstable sense of self - i will say this; in terms of mimicking, it isn't just mimicking the way someone talks. it is also mimicking the bad parts of someone. i have realized i also mimic my ex partners behaviors that aren't good behaviors as well as his typical behaviors. (he's my most recent ex/fp, he split up with me two weeks ago due to my bpd being wildly out of wack.)
3. unstable relationships - this one screams bpd. 100%. it hurts to read cuz i know how it feels to be in love and in a fairytale like love to hating the person suddenly.
4. repetitive suicidal thoughts, threats, gestures or behaviors - i also constantly having that thought in my mind. it's always sitting in the back of my mind. i ODed before, a few years ago. the thoughts, threats, gestures and behaviors haven't left since. i've told my mom i'd do it in front of her one time when she made me very angry. i tend to go to suicidal thoughts/threats after most arguments with my most recent ex. i'm not sure why but i feel like i crumble to the ground and i just want it to be over. i'm not very in control of myself at this point and i just want it all to end most days. so i get it. 100%.
5. frantic efforts to avoid abandonment - this sounds a lot like bpd as well. i sometimes want people who hurt me. i sometimes don't care that they did. i chalk it up to i deserve it because of my bpd. i don't know if you do that.

0,I would leave for good. You deserve someone better than that having BPD is enough without that slob draining you even more he knows how to play you and he will. Getting with another person with BPD he will be doing the same to her,shortgoffgf,1cfsqxh
1,"Also, this was for me personally when I was your age. I'd make a lot of dicey sexual decisions and my bpd, being neglected and abused as a child up untill my late teens played a huge role in making bad decisions that I didn't even want to make. I hurt more people than I am proud of, and I didn't even want to sleep with them or hook up with them. 

What worked for me was trying to make it as not about sex as possible. I think being this way makes things feel like it is a lot more than what reality is. And that included sex for me.

I was just making very bad decisions... And as much as other people had their role and responsibility in it. I am responsible for choosing poorly and making bad decisions. Whether I have bpd or not. We all are... It's just much harder with bpd because of splitting and other issues it causes",Intelligent-Fun4320,1cfsqxh
2,"Girl dump him, you were doing better without him. He came into your life and made it a poop show and made you regress on top of everything you had already went through. It's good to acknowledge what you've done wrong. I was in your shoes kinda before, my relationship wasn't as toxic as this but leaving completely and moving on will help you so much. Once I left that toxic relationship. I worked on myself again and got in remission.",InkBlotArt,1cfsqxh
3,"I used to make a lot of dicey sexual decisions and I ended up ruiningy first long term relationship because I was cheating and just being impulsive. I felt the same way, sometimes I would just hook up with people just because I thought it would fill a void. That's why I feel like he's my karma I deserve and honestly that's why I've forgiven him so many times. I think he has BPD too and I think that maybe he truly loves me, and just slept with other people to make me jealous or to feel something. Ever since I got pregnant and on lamotragine honestly my sex drive has been dead which has actually been really nice! I'm normally hypersexual from trauma but now I'm just focusing on hobbies. I still need to work on my intense uncontrollable anger though",constellationcapra,1cfsqxh
4,I'm glad you found a way that works for you. I don't thu k you ever deserved the bad treatment... No matter what you did. I am happy for you that you found a way to reduce the hyper sexual traits in yourself. I still struggle with that today.,Intelligent-Fun4320,1cfsqxh
