0,MBT + Psychotherapy BPD recovery,"I know lots of people who went down the DBT route. I have been in MBT + Psychotherapy combination treatment for some time and things are going great. Life is much easier now I'm aware and despite the odd wobble I'm happy. My friends notice a huge difference and so does my partner. ( hes seen me at my worst ) Me stable has become the new norm and we are doing things we never could have done before I got help. 
I would recccomend MBT to anyone struggling with internal emotions (wether you realise you are or not) every day I'm repairing the damage I caused to others before treatment. Particulary loved ones that suffered as a result. There is hope out there. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't change, you can and if you want to you will.
