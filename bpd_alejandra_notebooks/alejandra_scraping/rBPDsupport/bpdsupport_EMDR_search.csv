3,Emotional outbursts,"Hi guys, Iâ€™m new in here and need help. I have come a long way in healing myself and trying to cope with my BPD. Recently my irritability has gotten worse and worse where I got so upset about my friends dog eating my shoe that I took it out on my friend in the middle of Walmart.. I felt so guilty afterward and felt like I wanted to end everything;  this friend is also my FP. Theyâ€™ve done so much for me and I just want them to feel happy again but itâ€™s hard to do that while Iâ€™m struggling so bad. I feel like I ruin everything and feel so empty. My depression and SH is getting out of hand as well and Iâ€™m sharing this with my care team but I bottle it up while Iâ€™m not with friends. Iâ€™m getting to the point where I donâ€™t want to try anymore and Iâ€™m afraid thatâ€™ll make me lose my friendships and lose my relationships with my mom again. Some symptoms Iâ€™ve been having is isolating, extreme irritability, constant feeling of loneliness, intense emotions, trying to shut people out and taking it out on myself through my ED and other harmful coping mechanisms. My therapist is trying to do child work with me and at this point itâ€™s doing more harm than good for my mental state. If anybody knows any coping skills, meds, or any type of treatment, Iâ€™m willing to hear about it.

4,All my coping mechanisms are bad,"I have no good coping mechanisms, most of them revolve around self punishment and self sabotage. Can someone please share me what the first steps are towards making better coping mechanisms? I am so lost, and I don't know any people who have BPD too. I just want to cognitively and emotionally have a better response to feeling stressed or overwhelmed instead of doing to same things over and over again that hurt me. Honestly, I just want some friends who have BPD who can tell me ""No, that feeling is not normal, it's because of BPD"". I feel like it's always going to be this way, no matter what therapist, no matter what medication. Please tell me that it does get better. Please share your journey with me, I really need to know that it will get better and that change is possible.",1560119882.0,False,5,2,trashflower7,None,byq47h,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/byq47h/all_my_coping_mechanisms_are_bad/
5,End friendship bc my ex-bff didn't feel like she could be open to me because of my reactivity,"I just had nearly 15 year long former best friend say she only wants to keep in touch via social media. 

I kept asking questions trying to understand the why and part of it came down to her feeling the friendship was one-sided (which I would give ANYTHING for her to have talked to me about before she made up her mind that she was done with the friendship). 

She spoke of not feeling close anymore. (Which seems crazy considering I just spent the money to come out to TX and spend a week with her and her fiancÃ©e last May. Trip ended on a good note everyone generally was happy. I even texted back and forth about TSwift with her fiancÃ©e for weeks after the trip. So cleaely I didn't make some sort of horrible impression) But like you had me stay in your home? But we aren't close?Seems like such a flip up. 

Anyways, I asked her about why she felt less close to me because she felt she couldn't confide in me becauae of my emotional stability (she is generally a Very emotionally stable person who had a very good supported structured childhood for reference). 

She replied as follows: ""I see how you react strongly to things, and it makes me feel on guard in the things I talk about with you. I have felt in the past like when I have different ways of seeing things from you, you have shut the conversation down, which makes me wary of being honest, but also doesn't feel fair to just listen and support your perspective. So when you talk about how our relationship seems like it would be superficial going forward, that is something that I have felt for a while already on my side.""

I'm devastated. I'm worried other people won't confide in me and will then resent me and end friendships with me because I can get flooded and be ""extremely passionate"" as my therapist puts it.... ðŸ˜ªðŸ’”ðŸ’”


Her and I have been friends since 1st period German class in 7th grade. Even when she switched schools partway through high school my effort was enough for us to remain best friends until college. 

But I was really sick at the time everyone else went off to college and had to take time off which meant staying home with my abusive parents . Guys I thought turning 18 would protect me from their abuse but all it did was make them bolder. It was awful I ran away and stayed on the street for about 4 years off/on. Hannah was the only person who stayed my friend throughout that period everyone else was ""too busy"" or just couldn't take it. 

Now obviously my emotional regulation has been shit since then. And I obviously have PTSD and if I get triggered and flooded I have trouble staying in control (I'm also autistic so voice colume control is just an issue in general ðŸ˜…)

I have come a long long way though since getting housing and especially since finding my current therapist 1.5 yrs ago who does EMDR. 

I feel like I wasn't given a fair chance because while the me of 5 years ago would split pretty often, me today generally has fotten pretty good at walking the middle path. I also was raised where disagreement always led to interjecting to shut down the other person. Plus one of my OCD themes is morality & political correctness so people saying things that don't line up with my brain's rules would create massive anxiety and I would feel the need to correct them. None of that obviously invalidates her emotions but I just feel like I wasn't given a chance to show my growth because she never raised the issue with me until I quesrioned her after she already made an immovable decision to basically all but cut contact. 

BPDers who have managed to have friends for long periods of time, how do you keep the give & take even and how do you make sure your friends feel safe xonfiding in you and having deep conversations??

6,emotional invalidation,"Does anyone else really get stuck on the idea of masking emotion? For so many years hearing to just be myself be natural and feel my feelings....I get so angry that no, in order to get by in life I have to lie about how I feel. 
My negative thinking and anger, self pity and such are becoming a real problem in every aspect of my life. 
To me the core of BPD is feeling emotionally invalidated but the. To survive we have to suppress and deny our emotions...my autistic logical brain hates this. I want to let out my feelings but they only bring punishment ostracization and so on. They get in the way of doing anything because I just haaaave to do what I feel like doing or stop trying to take action on unwanted tasks to avoid meltdown. Im tired of having to participate in roommate life, society, work, everything bc it takes such conscious control of my impulses and feelings at all times. Im worn out trying to be normal and can't tell when to take self care advice or when its time to compromise. I wish being honest, spontaneous and natural was actually okay the way They say it should be. To be honest that feels like lifelong gaslighting - just be you and it will all work out! Maybe for some folks. 

I feel like a permanent toddler, like I should just be able to do what I want, but I'm constantly in trouble, melting down and being judged for it. 

Is this something DBT works on? Or some kind if trauma healing therapy? 

Therapy sometimes just feels like more gaslighting. did EMDR once and it RUINED my life for years after. I even drew my therapist a comic of the different parts of me in boxes and her erasing the lines, the little tantrum throwing kid got out and the whole comic fell apart. She still pushed ahead and sure enough, I lost control and did some horribly embarrassing public meltdown that landed me in jail.

I want to understand the appeal of Adult Regulated life besides ""behave or else."" It so viscerally unappealing despite all the perks. My body & emotions really do seem to be stuck in toddler stage and its so frustrating!

8,So Stuck RN,"I have had periods of being very well emotionally regulated, mostly when I am modeling good behaviors/actions for others. What ultimately happens is I am so focused on others that I forget to tend to myself. Iâ€™ve had a few bottoms. One came during the plague with social isolation. I then got a WFH job and social engagements got super hard for me. Looking back I can almost see my self completely unwind. Stop going to gym, stop journaling, stop meditating, stopped taking showers, changing clothes, brushing teeth, then stopped taking my medications bc if I take the ADHD meds I feel locked inside my head and almost paralyzed on the outside. By this time my head had 8 different trains of thought on 6 tracks and at least one wants me to unsubscribe from life and they constantly whirl around up there. I asked for accommodations from my company and they then found a reason to fire me (Top sales rep, most customer compliments) and I tail spun. 

So I swore I would unsubscribe from life before giving up my 325ft studio apartment (bc it was mine and I paid for it all by myself) and move back in with my parents. Sooooâ€¦..my brother let me crash with him. My head was so dark and so mean to me that getting out of bed seemed impossible. Sublet the studio to someone who is trashing it and also wants to sleep with me. (Uggggg)

So now, I have done EMDR, ART, DBT, CBT and Iâ€™m therapy and have a psych and Iâ€™m still in this rut where I JUST DONT CARE ABOUT MYSELF AT ALL ANYMORE. Itâ€™s like the spark or fire went out. I canâ€™t seem to find it. Brother was paying for top tier therapy and now itâ€™s been downgraded to better help. Heâ€™s upset heâ€™s not getting a return on investment bc I havenâ€™t been able to be more regulated for the last 2 years. 

Iâ€™ve gained over 100lbs in 2 years thanks to gastroparesis from Weygovi/Ozempic/Rybelsus. 

I now have a bedroom that I operate out of and while my brother can be super encouraging and supportive, lately I only hear what Iâ€™m doing bad/wrong.

Now dad has had heart issues, step sis going thru divorce from a narcissist - she has two kids 4/9 and sheâ€™s a flight attendant with her own Trumanâ€™s manifesting in such dysfunction rn. (Which is effecting the kids)

I can show up for my dad and step sis and my niece and nephew and lately, I put the very disassociated mask on where Iâ€™m modeling good behaviors, showering, changing clothes, doing laundry, doing sisters dishes and laundry and going to doctor appointments. Did I make my psych appt this monthâ€¦nope. Dad in hospital. 

When those duties/obligations endâ€¦..I deflate back into a dark hole who doesnâ€™t really care if I see tomorrow. 

2018-2022 I racked up over 30k in debt, so thereâ€™s a bankruptcy that gets to happen, and Iâ€™ve asked multiple people to be my body double so I can sit down and get the information I need so I can file it. Currently, if I go back to work, one of my more aggressive lenders will get a judgement and garnish my wages. Itâ€™s so traumatizing for me that I did this to myself that I donâ€™t feel safe doing it alone. 

I filed for disability bc itâ€™s actually proving that me acting as the Geico duck in the boat plugging all the multiple holes (my familyâ€™s needs) is enough to be a full time job and I have adhd, ptsd, BPD, anxiety, agoraphobia, social anxiety. I donâ€™t have clothes that fit. So I have mostly pajamas. I hate going in public and wonâ€™t do social things. And Iâ€™m so dysregulated rn that I couldnâ€™t imagine working part or full time doing anything. 

I donâ€™t know how or when we crossed that tipping line of full heartedly believing that my life is worthless. I donâ€™t matter, I donâ€™t want to be here, and have made certain promises to not do the thing I really want to do while parents are alive, or in familyâ€™s house. (This is one area where black and white thinking is helping me.) I care more about NOT inflicting trauma on my family than I care about myself.

I very much wish that I felt/believed/desired like I was capable of going back to giving a fuck, and taking my meds, and showering and looking forward to working out, wanting to be social, enjoying life rather than I have XYZ task that drains my batteries and takes all my spoons so now I need 4 days to recharge. Itâ€™s exhausting. 

I cannot seem to create and keep a routine bc nothing is routine. Iâ€™m pulled to take care of the kids or dad has new appts nearly every week. Iâ€™ve lost enjoyment and fulfillment in the things that used to make me happy like painting or singing. 

Everything hurts, every muscle aches. I donâ€™t feel like stretching helps.

I find that I am seeing or aware of every flaw of my body and limitations since gaining all this weight. I could go on and on.

Iâ€™m getting frustrated at my limitations and when the frustration hits Iâ€™m not able to positively spin it to find a way to overcome it, the frustration is too loud and draining and before I can even acknowledge it and catch it to try to reframe it, my batteries are dead. 

I donâ€™t know where to start or what to do first. I assume itâ€™s one little thing to the next. I just donâ€™t know how to do it when i genuinely donâ€™t want to be here and donâ€™t care. I am truly stuck. Like stuck stuck. 

Anyone with any experience with this apathy and stuckness, Iâ€™d really like some help from people who have been where i am and found a way to care again.

I live in the US and our mental health resources are limited and sorely underfunded and my family doesnâ€™t have the resources to put me in a nice place for 90 days that would force me to have a routine.
