0,I‚Äôm not sure what kind of relationship you have with your mom. Maybe you could communicate with her about how you feel? Maybe if you can gently point out how she says things can hurt your feelings she would understand. You could both agree on a way she can address her concerns without hurting your feelings.,Rowdylilred,1cfgtq7
1,"I go through the same thing I think if your mom's like mine, she may be a narcissist that's why when we're silly or happy or even upset they drag us down lower. My mom makes me feel like I'm nothing, it's very heartbreaking I'm sorry you're still living with her",devilsissue,1cfgtq7
2,"hi! thank you so much for the reply. it just sucks because i've tried to explain to her so many times. we're really close; she's an ex-alcholic and we're past all of the stuff she did and i did that hurt eachother even though she's still really blunt ‚Äî but she still cant take into account that it hurts me when she does that, you know? i tried explaining to her and she kind of just said ""well, it's not my fault you're taking it that way"" and in other words told me i was acting weird, and i kind of just wished she didn't mind me being myself.",ccovenss,1cfgtq7
3,"I‚Äôm so sorry üòû I understand how you feel and can empathize with you. I grew up with a mother who didn‚Äôt believe in mental health. I couldn‚Äôt open up to her at all about how I felt without being bullied about it. Your mom is not communicating in a healthy way with that kind of response. 

Unfortunately, all I can tell you is keep being yourself, kiddo. If she accuses you of doing drugs, respectfully tell her that you‚Äôll consent to a drug test. Tell her you‚Äôre just having a really good day and trying to make the most of it. Keep enjoying your good days. This disorder gives us many bad days. Please, do not dull who you are for anyone. You deserve every second of happiness you can get. Maybe she will grow to understand. Maybe not. But regardless, you do deserve to embrace your good days.",Rowdylilred,1cfgtq7
4,"Yeah 100% a narcissist. She doesn't care if she hurts your feelings because it's never their fault even when it clearly is.¬†
Move out as soon as you can is all I can say and don't tell her things you're excited about because she'll try to tell you you can't do it or have some type of tantrum about it and it's just not worth the fight",devilsissue,1cfgtq7
5,"i really hope you know how much you made my day, thank you ü´∂",ccovenss,1cfgtq7
6,Unfortunately narcissists don't change and they want to keep you dependent on them so she will not be happy if you try to set boundaries or your own endeavors¬†,devilsissue,1cfgtq7
7,"Narcissistic Personality Disorder is serious, and I don‚Äôt think you nor I are capable of diagnosing that based on the given details. ‚ÄúNarcissist‚Äù is thrown around too frequently on the internet.",Rowdylilred,1cfgtq7
8,"I'm 99% confident I'm right. But sure¬†
My mom is a narcissist and I'm just saying it sounds pretty up there with narcissist behavior¬†",devilsissue,1cfgtq7
9,"Well, while one may show narcissistic traits, having Narcissistic Personality Disorder is a lot more in depth. We don‚Äôt know how OPs mother functions at work and in other relationships. It could be a wide range of other issues that lead to OPs mother acting as she does. It could simply be ignorance and poor parenting. It could be other disorders. And it could be NPS, as you said. But we are not qualified to make that assessment based upon one post. Mental health professionals will not diagnose someone with any disorder based on such a small amount of context. She would need a proper evaluation by a professional. 

For all we know, OPs mother has little understanding of mental health. Maybe OPs mother was never taught how to properly parent and communicate. Maybe she is drowning in bills and life stress, and she is overwhelmed by OP‚Äôs problems so she shoves them under the rug. She may not intend harm, but is still causing it. 

There are hundreds of explanations outside of a very serious disorder.",Rowdylilred,1cfgtq7
10,I dont remember specifying which narcissist level she is.¬†,devilsissue,1cfgtq7

0,"I‚Äôm so sorry you feel this way. I know it‚Äôs so hard when you have problems so young that nobody really understands. If you ever need to talk or vent I can help. Also I would recommend trying to talk to a therapist online, if not, try some hobbies that can take your mind off of the negative. For example trying starting a sport, joining a club, playing online video games, even just talking with my family members usually helps me calm down.¬†
I know you feel so lost and sad but I promise it‚Äôll get better. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π¬†",Idkanymorehelp101,1c3p13h
0,I also feel this. I may be fully engaged in something and then for a few seconds I'm bored and stop doing that. Have gotten better at not replacing it with self sabotage but not all the way there yet,ThugsBunnny,19bud9r
1,"I feel the same way. I‚Äôm just absolutely lost whenever I‚Äôm bored and my mind wanders off easily, especially when my friends with whom I‚Äôd usually talk aren‚Äôt available. 

You‚Äôre not alone with that. üñ§",wherewaspie,19bud9r
2,"It's chronic emptiness. Something that you'll have to learn to deal with. It's due to us not being able to connect with ourselves and self sooth.

It's why we engage in destructive behaviour.

It's a major struggle for me but acknowledging the emptiness and letting it pass really does help.",BettySwollocks45,19bud9r
0,"Hello! If you don‚Äôt mind, I will try to share my experience regarding this issue, and also express some thoughts on this matter.

I have always had (and most likely will have) problems finding friends. I wouldn‚Äôt say that I have difficulties with communication, most often I can start communication, but I simply don‚Äôt want/don‚Äôt see the point in it (lately I often predict disappointment in communication and then isolate myself from any communication)

So most often it was my friends who found me and not I them. What‚Äôs even worse in this situation is that situations usually happen sooner or later after which I simply leave and stop communicating, remaining partially/completely alone.

what can help in this situation?

It is possible to search for a community of interests, but you can‚Äôt guess for sure - it can either help or cause disappointment. (example: about 4 years ago I tried to stream and a guy found me and called me to his discord server where I found cool friends and good communication, although 3 years after that there were a couple of serious quarrels within this community and as a result many went their separate ways)

I've heard situations where people made friends at work, but I never had that happen (maybe because I hated all the jobs I had)

So I think this is a very serious problem. because lack of communication ruins many things at once!

I wish you to find good friends who can support you when it‚Äôs hard and with whom you will enjoy spending time!",sakionakibara,1cyiz44
1,i don‚Äôt have a job and dropped out of uni and lost all of my friends a few years ago so i just started ‚Äòshitposting‚Äô (i hate that term) - posting memes on my personal fb page and accepting friend requests from random ppl. they‚Äôd comment on what i‚Äôd share and we‚Äôd laugh about it and eventually they or i would DM the other and build on a friendship from there. i‚Äôve made some pretty lovely and permanent friends that way to be honest,Nolleo,1cyiz44
2,"Thanks, yea because of my physical limitations its been rough as it cuts me off from most social spaces and after my friend died when i was 15 i completely stopped even trying to meet others i dropped out of HS and just homeschooled myself. Idk its just rough i can never hold a relationship",-PlotzSiva-,1cyiz44
3,"in that case, add some things! sometimes online communication is easier than IRL (easier both in the context of embarrassment and the like, and in the context that it‚Äôs easier to get together for communication. When I had communication in IRL, it often happened that meetings were disrupted because people had things to do... it had a bad effect on me because I started to screw myself up and think that I was the reason and that they really hated/avoided me)

also a few words about relationships (I hope I understood you correctly and you meant a romantic relationship) - for me, relationships (or rather their breakup) became the main reason for the progression of my BPD, and also almost became the end of my life. After this extremely painful and unsuccessful attempt at a relationship, I made a decision for myself that it was not worth it for me and it was dangerous for my life to have a relationship. I understand that everyone has a unique life experience and even everyone experiences the same situations differently, but for me personally, a relationship is letting someone manage your life (I mean that such a person can make you happy and help you grow as a person, but also can destroy everything you had and it‚Äôs not a fact that you‚Äôll be able to recover after everything)

this is my experience... I always hope that this will somehow help people avoid such painful situations as the ones I faced",sakionakibara,1cyiz44
0,"That is tough, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this right now. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre feeling a lot regarding the whole thing. When your partner lies, they are manipulating the relationship by taking advantage of your trust in them. It sounds like this has really affected your trust in him, rightfully so. I would be upset. I do think it is important for you to have the conversation with him, it‚Äôs triggering because it‚Äôs poking at parts that still need healing. Your body is just trying to keep you safe. Have you expressed to him how you feel about it?",DaOneAnOly,181e9u2
0,"It‚Äôs like almost like two different people, because it‚Äôs like when I make those stupid decisions, I just don‚Äôt care but then when I‚Äôm back to myself, it literally causes me so much stress and genuine problems for me, that really effect me mentally, and my relationships with people and when people are angry with me and question why I did something, I always think to myself and always have, I don‚Äôt know why either and that‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs always bothered me.

1,"nothing is wrong with you, definitely sounds like you may have bpd or at least bpd symptoms. i also become completely consumed by relationships it‚Äôs super hard :( with what you‚Äôre describing it sounds to me like you are experiencing splitting. i would look more into bpd awareness and coping skills specifically with relationships. if you‚Äôre unable to access therapy at this time, maybe find some other free resources or mental health support groups/warm lines! you‚Äôre not alone and it can get better and more manageable. i am 20 and finally in a relationship that isn‚Äôt abusive or completely self sabotaged by myself. (of course i still split and have bad days and symptoms but my partner is very understanding) anyway, to be honest i would just take time for yourself right now if you can. don‚Äôt rush into another relationship until you can understand and take care of yourself more. you should come first always ik it‚Äôs hard to think that way but it‚Äôs important to prioritize your mental health > relationships especially with bpd. wishing you health and happiness my friend",Regular-Ad-2446,1cqm5ws

What worked for me was trying to make it as not about sex as possible. I think being this way makes things feel like it is a lot more than what reality is. And that included sex for me.

I was just making very bad decisions... And as much as other people had their role and responsibility in it. I am responsible for choosing poorly and making bad decisions. Whether I have bpd or not.

1,"<sigh> I don't feel so awful for my habit, now. Thanks. I can connect with you 110% on this.

Sometimes when I feel particularly shitty about my self-medicating, as I smoke enough to be labeled a ""stoner,"" and there is definitely a ""stoners are dumb losers"" stigma, I think about how much positive research there is concerning medicinal marijuana right now and it makes me feel a bit better about it. 

You know what I just realized? I think smoking is when I practice mindfulness. There was a thread posted in one of the BPD subs recently about when we practice mindfulness, and I couldn't think of any particular times when I do, but I think that's part of why smoking is therapeutic for me. I was about to make a comment about how smoking particularly helps me when I feel like I'm about to slip into a dissociative episode, and I always just assumed that getting high just... interrupted my downward spiral and didn't give it much more thought. Well, it JUST dawned on me WHY the act is so helpful for me: I'm taking the time to focus on being in the present, I'm paying attention to grinding the bud, how it smells, how it feels, packing my bowl, making sure I don't spill, the heat of the lighter when I spark it, taking a nice, deep inhale and letting it all out... I'm practicing mindfulness. Now I REALLY feel better about my self-medicating!

Honestly, I don't think it's that big of a deal in the long run. The only part of smoking a lot that I struggle with is that it can leave me feeling a bit unmotivated, and I already struggle in that regard without any aid. I'm still trying to strike a better balance there, but I figure if I can get a better handle on my depression, I'll get a better handle on the motivation issue, too.

Either way, you're awesome. I definitely do not think you should feel down about yourself for this one.",ThisBorderlineLife,3gir98

I used to feel guilty about it but I honestly see it as no different from having a beer after work or a daily psych med. It's a little of both. And fuck, the actual doctors will give me Ativan, which is way more habit forming and addictive than weed. It's just the stigma.",,3gir98

Believe me, if I could get it easily, I'd be doing it too. I'd vape rather than roll joints, because fuck tobacco basically. But I can't. It's so unfair; alcohol is such a destructive drug and weed really isn't...but that's the one that's illegal?! Thanks, government.",,3gir98
5,"I used to smoke it too. Every single day. Some days it was the first thing I'd  do in the morning. It helped Shush the noise in my head (I know how nuts that sounds but I know people here will understand what I mean).

I can certainly see why people do it and although it's not physically addictive, I did become dependant on it to a point where I couldn't handle any kind of stress or emotion without smoking.

I quit a couple months ago cold turkey. Quit cigarettes too but use a vaper still. I miss it sometimes especially when I'm feeling particularly low or feel my emotions getting too intense. It helped me sleep too and I'm still struggling with that part. None of my doctors or therapists I'd ever seen agreed with my habit and I ended up having to lie to get them to stop haunting me about it.
I used to abuse valium/xanax and alcohol also. I quit all that and miss it sometimes too.

All I'd say in warning is we have very addictive personalities so try to limit it to the smoking and don't allow yourself to get to the stage where you can't function a few hours without it. Other than that I still believe it's a legitimately helpful drug when used correctly.

EDIT: And for the record, the way you spoke about the voices and you knowing they were you and the sort of things they say... all that could've came from me word for word and is exactly why I smoked weed too!

I also use alcohol & drugs to self medicate so that I can take a break from myself and be more capable in my life.

If your medication came in pill form prescribed by a doctor, would you be worrying about it so much? Or would you accept it as a treatment for a chronic mental health condition, the way that some people use antidepressants or mood stabilizers? 

And yeah, all the thoughts that insist on detailing all of the cringeworthy or unpleasant experiences of my life, or the constant internal narrative of self loathing are why I'm always busy doing stuff or distracted with media. I hate being alone with my thoughts. You're not alone.

 So I don‚Äôt know if I have the best advice but I would suggest a few things. One is that there is a web site https://www.nyp.org/bpdresourcecenter that‚Äôs an online resource center for bpd and I‚Äôm sure they have suggestions on there and there‚Äôs also a crisis number I think, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs different from a suicide hotline or not. 
 Also you can look up dialectical behavior therapy techniques and start doing some on your own, that‚Äôs what the woman who assessed me recently suggested until I can get into a therapist. 
 Other than that there‚Äôs all the distracting stuff that might help, regular exercise, hobbies etc. I know those aren‚Äôt always useful in the midst of an episode or breakdown though but at the least it can be ways to give your brain more dopamine which can be beneficial. 
 Another thing, I know this is not easy either, especially when your suspicious of how they really feel, but trying to talk to your boyfriend, trusted friends and or family can be helpful. If you can allow yourself to be vulnerable and open with them it can work as a sort of exposure therapy. 
 It all takes work and dedication because it seems so hard to control ourselves or our emotions but we can do it!

Also, I'm proud of you for stopping drugs. Even if you relapse, you are still worthy of life. People with addictions can still be good people. You can still try again, too, if you relapse. It may not seem viable but there's always more chances. But the fact that you fight your relapse every day is all the more remarkable. The fact that you see all the reasons you want to/should do drugs and still fight it makes it that much more incredible. I can't imagine how exhausting that must be. Thinking about drugs doesn't mean you're still on the drugs. They are so different. I know you're struggling and it must hurt. There's always a valid reason the mind is the way it is.

0,"I see you and I can somewhat relate. It used to be rather severe - the rage and depressive episodes consuming me because of triggers which reminded me of my perception that I have no control and these cycles keep perpetuating.

DBT is helpful but also it is all so super exhausting, that conscious constant continous inner fight. Sometimes I just want to be and sometimes I just be for 2 days too longs and then spiral with letting go of each thing and just never getting back up in weeks or months.

It now comes in for a day or two and I can recognize the early early signs. Once I do or my healthy support structure reminds me of certain things we've written down that happens, I begin to increase my selfcare practices.

Especially two things. HRB and Neurographica. They require very little effort from me and they both make a physiological difference.

I have a free app for the Heart Rhythm Breathing, so all I do is place my finger on the camera and follow the ball inflation and deflation which assists me in breathing Rhythmically. That changes my coherence, makes the nervous system counter the cortisol production. If I am declining, I fit in 4 to 5 sessions of 10 to 20 minutes in just lying down on the grass or bed whoever you are able to or sit anywhere and breath through a session focusing on getting my breathing in Rhythm.

It also shows you your HRV (Heart rate variability) scores which can tell you how depressed and far gone you are and will start picking up the deeper you're able to hold your Rhythms.

Check out Dr Alan Watkins he explains about HRV Rhythm breathing and coherence with regards to performance, but it can be used like this.

Neurographica is also absolutely wonderful and a proven therapy method by Pavel Pascarev that Stimulates the brains neuroplasticity and helps with rewiring.

They've been saving my life, especially is those times when I feel like I just cannot! It's easy, it does not require big effort from me and it is something I can do anywhere on my phone and if practiced enough without anything and as that begins making a difference in my energy and reasoning brain, I regain the ability to do the other practices, like go back to the gym or get some sun and take daily walks, listen to good hormone inducing music etc.

I hope you can find the tools that work for you.üôè",barely_parenting,ywe7vy

I'm not trying to be a jerk, I just want to make sure we're using the same terminology.  


Regardless of your illnesses, what this all comes down to is triggers between the two of you. Do you know what they are? How do you cope in certain situations? What kind of techniques do you use to self-soothe? You mention he's on meds; are you on meds? Are either of you seeing a therapist? If he's in a bad spot, can you support him even if that means you might be triggered and could send you spiraling? Can he support you?  
 

Having a relationship with a normal joe and someone whose crazy is hard. When you have two crazies, it's even harder because its a constant check and balances. And while relationships can be hard even if you're ""normal,"" you're easily looking at twice the work when mental illness is involved. If you think he's beyond worth it and could be someone see a future with, make the commitment. And not to say he's ""too much,"" but if you feel you cannot support him if he relapses or if there are too many risks involved, let him go.

2,"What an amazing reply!!! And not a jerk at all! Thank you so much. Sorry, yes I do mean Borderline Personality Disorder. I get confused with acronyms lol! I agree it is something that needs to be weighted. Especially as we have children on either side to take into consideration. I am medicated on Concerta and Mephylenidate. Which has seen an awful amount of my impulsive and emotional behaviours balance out. So, I would say I am the more level headed out of the two, well as much as an ADHDian can be. 
I am triggered by violent episodes around me, I am noise and smell sensitive. One occasion I jumped out of a window during an argument years prior to meeting my ex. The noise vibrates through my skull and feels like physical torture. Although my ex is like a hot Brian Blessed (loud no matter the mood) it wasn‚Äôt until I bought up missing money did his voice become even louder and more aggressive in tone. So, that‚Äôs my trigger. His trigger from what I can gather is his addictions being found out (gambling and cocaine), he had lied for months about needing money which me being me was like a walking bank. Then when I pulled my funding (don‚Äôt want to be an enabler) he became even more defensive. So less about the addictions and more about the need to lie. Coming from a background of mental health I would like to think I can understand him and his motivations. I lie too when I have been impulsive on Amazon and it has taken a lot of therapy to be honest not just with others but with myself. Couples therapy sounds like an awesome plan, I already have a therapist for my ADHDitude but I wonder if he will think this is an attack on his feelings? How are you and your husband now? I really appreciate the reply and it has definitely given me plenty to think about. I honestly believe that someone with borderline personality disorder is more than worth the effort.

But a lot of what you described growing up and how your felt is how I felt. I haven't had any drug problems or weight problems but I think it's mostly because my mom and all her brothers had drug addictions so I've always been really careful with that.

I've been misdiagnosed bi polar also but always knew that was wrong because my mood swings are caused by outer circumstances not chemical imbalance and because my sister is bi polar so I've seen manic episodes and I don't have those.

People with borderline have had physician assisted deaths in countries where that is offered. May be no surprise.

Second is that DBT is designed to recognize that life is not always ""worth living"", and feeling as you described may be a life that's not ""worth living"" (why else would you be desperate for escape?). One point is to focus on that reality and risk , managing to cope with new tools while building the relationships, meaning and habits that can sustain a life you chose.

I can't say why your psych tells you ""you're doing well"", whether it's communication on your part, or perhaps just the limit of their validation and awareness. The fact you were previously on 5 medications at once is a small concern and maybe suggests that wasn't right care for you; in general fewer meds= better recovery for pwBPD. I can't assume you have access to other care providers or treatment programs, but possibly a higher level of care, partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient would fit; or a different treatment approach would be a better match for you. You find the group setting increases your anxiety and emotional avoidance or dissociation?

I think my psychiatrist thinks I'm doing well compared to how I am when I'm admitted as an inpatient. I'm not sure that's a very fair benchmark though. I feel like she thinks my current level of suffering is acceptable because it's presenting as an improvement on where I was before. But it's always going up and down and honestly, even with the few moments where my mood is at its best, it's still not worth the remaining 99% of the time which seems to range from extremely difficult to absolutely unbearable.

I wasn't able to leave the house, but now I can sometimes with immense distress and difficulty. I'm still having crazy mood swings that I can barely manage. Just because I'm not aggressively trying to kill myself all the time and dont require constant surveillance doesn't mean I'm doing better enough to be left without help. She's refusing to prescribe any more medications because of the bad reactions I've had but honestly I would try anything at this point, even more bad drug reactions if it meant that this was not the level of normal I would be settling with for the rest of my life. I just feel like as long as I'm not immediately going to kill myself, that seems to be good enough, which seems cruel and disappointing. As things are, I don't know how much longer I can survive like this. 

I cycle through these suicidal loops so often that when I come out, I know I didn't really want to die, I just wanted to know that there was a possibility of a way out.

I don't want to minimise how unique your situation is, but I will say that I definitely share a sense that I'm living purely out of obligation to my family and also that it feels pretty much impossible for me to feel any positive emotions, enjoy anything or relax completely without self-judgment, fear or paranoia setting in.
