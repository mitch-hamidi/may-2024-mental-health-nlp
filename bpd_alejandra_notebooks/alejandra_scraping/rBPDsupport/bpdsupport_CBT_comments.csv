0,"I‚Äôve at times been an anti-psychiatry type, but in my and many others experience, medication is beneficial. Stopping weed/nicotine sucks, my experience has been that quitting after using for a while has caused emotional turbulence. I believe my medication has lessened the lows and destructive behaviors for me.  But most importantly: talk to a doctor about your options. Like others said, exercise, good habits, etc., a lot of the stuff traditionally advised for depression and general improved health will help you over time. A doctor will also be able to get a better picture of your health than this forum can. Wishing you the best.",beingandbecoming,17nzkl3
1,"Honestly starting meds was the best decision I ever made! I‚Äôm on Seroquel and Lithium, but find what works for you. I started out on these and these just happen to work best. Now, I still struggle with my BPD symptoms like mood swings, but they at a level I can control. That‚Äôs the goal - Management. I used to struggle a lot of suicidal tendencies, impulsive behavior and such but again, these are now thoughts that I sometimes have, but am able to control due to my medication. The medication gives me time to react and think about my decisions before I act on them. Before? I used to act then figure what the hell I needed to do to clean up the mess I made lol. I mention my struggles because I want you to know medication isn‚Äôt an end all be all, but it is 100% something I recommend to everyone considering getting on them especially pairing meds with DPT and CBT. It‚Äôs very helpful in the recovery process.

If you need help paying for meds, I do too, look at using apps like blinkhealth, goodRX, Cost Plus drugs, and even CVS has a discount card for medication. These services provide discounted prices for prescription medications. I‚Äôve used all of them. 

Also, this is a bit of advice you didn‚Äôt ask for but from a person with BPD to another. Staying off of social media has given my life a whole new meaning. Like I find myself enjoying my life and not comparing myself to others or becoming obsessed with people etc. Also try reading the book atomic habits, I know cheesy, but I just started it and it‚Äôs helping me. Idk, but it‚Äôs something to consider! ü§ç",,17nzkl3
2,"Holy shit I‚Äôm literally going through the same thing 
I‚Äôm not sure what you want to decide on for your journey but my psychiatrist told me that I should probably be on medication and antidepressants especially will help . I personally have major depression disorder as a diagnosis. But I do believe with the right medication can help the pain.  
If you‚Äôre gonna go on meds, I think considering your environment and your current lifestyle is important . For example I am currently working on quitting alcohol and nicotine.",TotalConstant9478,17nzkl3
3,"I‚Äôm on antidepressants and it really helps me, talk to your doctor about it if you feel like you need something. If you don‚Äôt like it you can always stop taking them",Demonderus,17nzkl3
4,Have you tried rigorous exercise? Serious question.,,17nzkl3
5,"I was recently diagnosed with BPD and yes the meds can help. It may be a long journey to find the right ones but as long as you know your medical background and have been logging everything and be open and honest about all your struggles and childhood and adult trauma they will adjust you to the correct ones. Please don't lose hope. A 24yF bullying/sexual assault and lack of emotional parental person. I've had it all. Get rid of the bad addictions, start with good things and find what makes you happy. Music, yoga, journaling, video diary, try it ALL.",Loud-Age-226,17nzkl3

Why add a story to it",Sir_Lee_Rawkah,17nzkl3
0,The STOP technique will help. As will any evidence based(CBT) therapy. It gives you time to respond healthily rather than set everything on fire with negative and obsessive behaviours.,BettySwollocks45,197tivn
1,Should I just Google the STOP technique?,WoahIssaMe,197tivn
0,"Your struggle is very real. Being high functioning just means we hid it well from others. That only means that we were continually imploding and we kept a lid on it.

Some people think that bpd is like an allergy that comes and goes but it isn't.

The distorted lens is always on until we dig down and remove it.",ShamalaDR,hxiyik

0,"Hey, how did your therapy appointment go? Sorry no one's responded yet :( but I'm here now!

Suicidal ideation sucks balls, as does being suicidal in general. Can you discuss starting DBT with your therapist? CBT is fine enough and might be able to help you a bit, but DBT is the one designed specifically for BPD. 

I really hope you're feeling a bit better now. And congratulations on your wedding! Your friend doesn't sound very understanding; can you talk to her about how you're feeling at all?",,3h5dc5
1,Thanks for responding. My therapist rescheduled for next Friday unfortunately. A lot has been going on but I saw my psychiatrist today and they adjusted my medicine. I'm hoping my therapist will work with me on DBT since she isn't specialized it in but they told me she'd be willing to learn it along with me. ,PiffTheFairyMuffin,3h5dc5
2,"Next Friday is far away, but when you weigh that against the idea of her putting in the effort to help you with DBT then it's not the worst. That sounds pretty good. I take it there's not the option to see someone who already specialises in it? Or you have a decent enough relationship with your therapist to not want to find someone else?

How is the meds adjustment going? I know it's early days but somtimes the side effects can come on quickly and that's not so fun, but even worse to suffer in silence. ",,3h5dc5
3,"I've never seen her before, she's the therapist I was assigned after I was discharged from the partial hospitalization program. She isn't a specialist or anything in DBT of BPD, so I'm hoping she works with me okay. My psychiatrist upped my Zoloft, decreased my seroquel, and decreased my trazadone.
