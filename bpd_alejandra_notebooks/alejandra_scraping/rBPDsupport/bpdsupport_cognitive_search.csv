0,Struggling with Executive Dysfunction/Cognitive Impairment,"Lately I feel like I can't get it together, like I can't focus/my brain just blanks on the task at hand (like a lot). I'll be in the middle of doing something, and I lose sense of what it was... This is new for me, and I feel it is affecting my work.

Is anyone else struggling with this? What do you do to make it better/easier?",1630692936.0,False,8,0,BPD_Lionheart,None,phaoxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/phaoxj/struggling_with_executive_dysfunctioncognitive/
1,All my coping mechanisms are bad,"I have no good coping mechanisms, most of them revolve around self punishment and self sabotage. Can someone please share me what the first steps are towards making better coping mechanisms? I am so lost, and I don't know any people who have BPD too. I just want to cognitively and emotionally have a better response to feeling stressed or overwhelmed instead of doing to same things over and over again that hurt me. Honestly, I just want some friends who have BPD who can tell me ""No, that feeling is not normal, it's because of BPD"". I feel like it's always going to be this way, no matter what therapist, no matter what medication. Please tell me that it does get better. Please share your journey with me, I really need to know that it will get better and that change is possible.",1560119882.0,False,7,2,trashflower7,None,byq47h,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/byq47h/all_my_coping_mechanisms_are_bad/
2,Need someone to talk to,"I've finally come to terms with my borderline personality disorder, along with other personality disorders that overlap with my borderline (npd, hpd, aspd). And because of that, I'm dealing with severe cognitive dissonance right now from having to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder. I just feel so disconnected from people most of the time. If they don't give me that intensity, or if they don't give me the admiration, attention, and affection l crave, I devalue them. This makes romantic relationships very very painful and unsuccessful. I often dream of material things such as fame, fortune, and success, because I feel as unless I achieve those things in life, nobody will ever love me, because that's how my parents raised me. 

""Mama said: fulfill the prophecy. Be something great: go make a legacy. Manifest destiny, back in the days, we wanted everythingzzz we wanted everything. Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated. All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting""
-Panic! At the Disco.

Because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic or sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would prefer to date a girl. I just can't. The attachment feels too intense and I feel too codependent, and it's just too strong of a feeling for me to handle. 

 I am ashamed of the fact that I'm so freaking selfish, and that I have this idea of a perfect partner in my head and it's all almost as if I just want somebody who is willing to just drop everything and be at my aid it's almost as if I just want somebody to serve me. It's very narcissistic and then when they don't give me the attention that I feel as if I deserve, and when I feel abandoned, I act out against them. I just want someone to unconditionally love me. But unconditional love does not exist. It is just a concept. Everybody wants something. Even the spiritual people who claim they unconditionally love people. They're doing it for themselves. They're doing it for that spiritual high for that connection with a higher power. I never experienced true parental love growing up, ny parents were narciissists too. So I don't believe in it. I almost want a partner to chase me and prove to me that this kind of love exists. I want them to be obsessed with me the way that I obsess over the object of my affection--The ""FP"" that I am idealizing at the moment. That is my definition of love, and its flawed.

I have tried DBT, and it actually makes me worse. I hate how DBT is oversold to people with BPD ---almost everybody that I have spoken to who had BPD who tried it said that it did not work for them. It's just a marketing gimic. 

I want to get better, but I feel hopeless and scared.  I know that I probably need to find a provider who specializes in cluster B. But even though it seems as if those people only seem to interpret us through what they read in books, and there's a lot of misinformation out there on cluster B's 

I also need to work with a therapist who could handle BPD and NPD and ASPD. Usually when I tell a therapist, I've been diagnosed with those things, they run. It's like ""oh, your borderline have you tried DBT?""

""Oh, wait, you're also a narcissist and sociopath? Well, then you're incurable. I'm sorry, but I can't help you at least if you were just a borderline you could try DBT""

 I feel as DBT works for some borderline because they're just borderline. I feel as if it's probably my NPD that makes me not react well to DBT.. People with MPD cannot handle that level of introspection. It literally makes my head explode. 

They don't recommend DBT for NPD. For NPD, you really just need serious talk therapy. Think about it narcissist get talking about themselves it's the most therapeutic thing, the world for somebody with NPD lol.

Either way, I just really need someone to talk to you because I feel very distressed tonight and I've been in a serious BPD episode for the past few weeks and I'm just now coming out of it!! despite by resistance to DBT I still am open to treatment and may even be open to going to a DBT group however, I just don't really know if I would be in a skills based group I feel as if I would be better off in some kind of therapy group, where you could just talk about your feelings and develop support.",1706439534.0,False,4,3,Actual_Pepper8815,None,1ad08fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1ad08fd/need_someone_to_talk_to/
3,FRUSTRATION STATION,"Hey all. Thanks for having me here. 

I'm (27 FtM) struggling to prioritize in my life. Having finally gotten some self awareness on the borderline patterns of attachment, obsession, and trying to break out of this cycle of centering my life around unattainable or unavailable people, living in fantasy worlds, being super self absorbed, venting and only talking to people when I want attention, validation etc. that is keeping me from moving forward, gaining skills, etc. Everyone is so frustrated with me and I have had to come to terms with being emotionally abusive/neglectful to my ex, neglectful at my jobs and of my pets and self. 

It feels very awkward and unnatural and forced to try to be consistent in friendship, my habits, life. I never have had serious addictions besides social media and other peoples approval. 

Im exhausted. But I know I do have habits and can form new ones because I definitely have bad ones like laying in bed all morning or spending a lot of time in my head. 
Its just that every single day my mood is different even on mood stabilizers and I'm used to doing what I feel like impulsively based on mood, or what I'm forced to do. Which is a surefire way to spin out of control or feel hopeless. I need to develop my OWN locus of control and discipline and its just shitty that my moods are the enemy when they so badly crave validation after decades of gaslighting and being blamed for their intensity and destructive power. 

Im wondering for those who are actively recovering...what has really really helped you out of old coping mechanisms? What were you able to commit to?

I am PDA autistic and have ADHD or bipolar, still waiting on a psych evaluation, but one of my biggest struggles is finding something to be consistent with that doesn't end up trashed by demand avoidance or getting bored/splitting on it. 

Every kind of routine or demand outside of my fixations ends up feeling like swallowing pills or pinching your nose to eat something nasty until I just stop. 

 Everyone says to fight depression, meditate find hobbies and get outside yourself find something to do for others, exercise. 
But I legitimately feel my habits and mental copes are like gravity or a black hole and getting out of them or making changes in life exhausts me and I collapse back into them. 

I guess this is just what recovery is like. But I've tried Codependents Anonymous, talk therapy, astrology, divination, meds (except ADHD meds about to start those), being more social, creative expression. At the end of the day my brain always finds a way to invalidate destroy or get convinced that thing ""isn't it."" The only thing I come back to is taking pictures on my phone (never organized) and writing long rants on the internet. Im so bored of my SELF. And analyzing myself and recounting my past trauma.. everyone else seems to somehow find something to do, or to love, or commit to,, even when we have the same diagnosis and experiences. 
Ughhhhhhhhhh. 

Is it really possible to form an identity and learn how to commit? 

I'm so tired from fighting myself. 

It feels like a normal life is just within reach if I could follow the steps (apply for jobs, show up to jobs, budget the money, move put of home state, take care of my body, cook and eat, have a creative routine, go on a run, care for my pet, evaluate which relationships are good to have around, spend time in nature, set boundaries, learn time management, learn emotional regulation) so I can get to a place where I feel stable enough to really connect with others and not sabotage everything or get hurt because I picked someone wrong.

 But those steps feel so impossible when I keep proving to myself over and over that I will not stick with anything, I will sabotage everything, and every single day I have a new idea about my next big project or career path or what ever. 

How do you build trust with yourself or anyone else without consistent effort? 
The only way I feel motivated is to get a FP or romantic interests approval, or extreme outside pressure and fear of punishment. 

Im just so frustrated I could scream for days. 

Does it get better? And how! Does DBT help with this? 

Consistency is literally the key to unlocking life, and I feel like someone tossed it into a vat of concrete Im supposed to chip away at with my fingernails.
