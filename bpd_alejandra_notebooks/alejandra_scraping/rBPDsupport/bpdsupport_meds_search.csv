0,What meds are you on? ,"I’ve been trying my best to get better without any medication since the start of the year. Things get better and then go downhill again. A lot of people are telling me to just go on meds as it has helped them drastically and anything that can help take it as improving without is extremely difficult. 

What has your experience been like? What meds/dosage are you on? How long have you been taking them? 

I’m just worried that if I start taking them then I’ll have to keep taking them. 

Did they really help you a lot to the point where you’re at least feeling 50% better and can manage/control your emotions more effectively?

I'm currently on a very low dose of lithium carbonate. It worked very well for me until it got me terrible intrusions all day long. I want to replace it for another med.

4,BPD and meds (Quetiapine),"Hi, recently I got diagnosed with bpd.
I’ve been struggling for a long time, and there were suspicions for BPD but now it is confirmed. To be honest it’s not that much of a surprise, I somehow knew I had it but was still hoping it’s not true.
My symptoms became more severe ever since I got into a relationship, including agressive outbursts, jealousy and a constant feeling of uneasiness. Blaming my partner constantly and feeling left out started to kill my relationship, and I didn’t want it to happen at all. Luckily my partner is patient and we somehow stayed together. I went to a psychiatrist, got diagnosed and now I am on Brintellixn(vortioxetine) and Quetiapine.
Already after a few days I can feel my moods are more stable, but quetiapine does make me sleepy and very hard to wake up in the morning. At this moment I am only taking 25 mg of quetiapine at night but I am supposed to up the dose to 50mg a day (25 in the morning, 25 at night).
As I have never experienced this drug I have my reservations and I am a bit scared of it’s sideffects (losing all emotion, drowsiness, weight gain, unable to concetrate)
Does anyone have experience with this drug? Do you like it? Or did you find something else that works better?",1701227895.0,False,1,0,unai96,None,186fg6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/186fg6l/bpd_and_meds_quetiapine/
5,Depression or missing meds???,"Hello everyone. I've been highly depressed lately esp here within the past two weeks. I mean it feels like just like it did a couple of months ago. I was upset/agitated/irritated/frustrated w/ everyone and everything that pissed me off. Even the slightest thing will piss me off. And I know this is a symptom of BPD but still it gets even worse when depression is involved. So I was feeling like that, I've also been sleeping a ton, which is something i always do when my depression hits, and now that I actually know that's one of my symptoms I'm more aware of it so I notice that's been happening this entire month. I thought it was because I just have a terrible sleep sched. But I'm just really confused. I know I skipped my meds for the past couple of days,  and I've skipped them a couple-a few times this month mostly because I've been at my bf's house and when I get tired at his house at night, I just do not want to get up and take them unless my mom reminds him to remind me to take them, which has been happening recently but at the beginning of the month and before that it wasn't happening so I would always miss taking them. My mom said that I could be feeling this extreme exhaustion because I missed a dose. I looked up the symptoms of accidentally missing a dose of an antidepressant and I had basically the maj of the symptoms on there. But knowing that, it still doesn't really justify even when I remember to take them. So I can't tell if I've just been depressed since december, or if there really had been a couple of months break from my depression and it's just now starting to hit again. Has anyone had this happen to you before? If so what did you think it was?

Edit: I've also been getting the feeling that I should just drop all my hobbies. My hobbies right now include art (both traditional and digital art), and music production. I feel like for one w/ the music production there's just so much to learn. And I feel frustrated because I just spend my entire day watching Youtube vids on how to do stuff. Which I agree is fine but I just want to actually get started on doing something and I spend the entire day watching vids too and I am always very indecisive on what to do w/ my music stuff. So there's the frustration w/ that, and w/ the art stuff I'm the same way. I tried laying out like a plan for my art stuff where I would like to be in 6 months. And this took all day to write out. I lay out a sched for the week of when I did this and I only followed through w/ it for one day and that was extremely frustrating to me because that told me I had taken the time to do that for nothing. So because of this frustration, I've just been getting the feeling that I should just drop everything. I also have a maj in psych right now and I'm even thinking that college isn't for me. I tried dong full time student w/ 4 classes last fall semester. It didn't work out at all, because I have extremly bad time management skills, and I knew that there was going to be a lot of work involved but my expectations were nothing like to what I experienced and because I didn't have the skills I needed I had to drop the classes because I was falling too far behind, and I also had depression/anxiety pretty bad at the time as well so that was coming into plat as well along w/ my BPD symptoms. So now I'm taking a summer class, but I realized when I looked more at the syllabus for the class earlier this week I realized it wasn't the class I thought I was signing up for. My thoughts were getting mixed up because I was reading the description for one class and then I read one for another and then I thought it was like an ""upgrade"" from the first class I read and it turns out it wasn't. I figured because of this, I can't take a class that I'm interested in because I won't be able to focus because I'll end up zoning out, because I won't want to pay attention and I can't do that in a college class or I'll miss a lot of things and fail. So I""m having to drop this class too. And it's just getting frustrating dropping classes so it makes me feel like I can't even do college either.

I had a handicap since i was a kid that led to a childhood full of bullying and resentment.
Was SAed by a trusted family member (not close family)
Bullied throughout kindergarten, elementary, and secondary school, it triggered me do much that I 
Feveloped a skin rash linked to stress and uncured.
Got type 2 diabetes at age 14.
Had body image issues as a teen/young adult. 

Started self harming on and off by age 14.

My older siblings  were overlooked since i got all the focus and attention being the youngest child and the sick one. I had to be accompanied by my parents for physical therapy and for talk therapy (for kids) for years and years. 
So i lived with the feeling of guilt since i took away all our parents focus, and time.

By 19h i was officially diagnosed with chronical  depression and general anxiety. 
Started using meds to just survive day to day life, but was never happy or anxiety free, just alive. 

By age 25 i tried to commit suicide and failed. (Insulin overdose: no one knew it was intentional).

I turned 30 and my doctor officially diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder. I read about it and it makes sense. 

I have a job that im giving the bare minimum to, and feels guilty for letting them down.
No friends because i cant keep a human relationships since i go through a lit of isolating phases.
I still see myself as the biggest burden to my old and tired parents. And a disappointment to my own self. 
I dont want to get better i want to disappear.

Im thinking about ending it all.

I dont want to traumatize my parents so no jumping from the rooftop or hanging in my room, im doing it by meds. 

I heard that if u mess up you can fuck urself up and not die so im looking for tips to not fuck it up.

16,Rose tinted glasses,"Hiya! So I've [M 26] been seeing a guy[M34] for about three months, give or take. Things were great in the beginning, and I'd been upfront about seeing a therapist. Well lately I've noticed, there's a lot more arguments happening over little things such as me trying to explain my feelings or thoughts. The most recent boundary/ feeling I expressed was feeling objectifed bc it seemed/ seems like all he cares about is being intimate but that's really it. Well right before the holidays [Christmas] I had an appointment ye ol shrink and got bumped up from emd [ episodic mood disorder] to straight up BPD [ sib cat. Quiet or discouraged] which after talking to the doctor and some people ik who also have this, that there's not much meds can really do to ""get rid of it"" and I've told this to my bf and said I'm going to up my appointments. He essentially flipped out on me bc according to him, I need meds bc he went to school for nurse stuff [failed whatever is before RN due poor life choices]. During his explanation he aggressively flipped over his coffee table and broke several candles while say "" honestly I could get drunk and go to any bar and get whoever I want"" which I'll admit still hurts...

18,BPD vs RAD,"I have BPD (current diagnosis) and was treated for reactive attachment disorder at a “troubled teen home”. 

I’m 21/F and was misdiagnosed with RAD (reactive attachment disorder) as a teen after I came out as gay to my parents. They blamed my “unhealthy attachment to women” as “mommy issues for being adopted” and claimed that I acted out and had behavioral issues. While I did have severe attachment issues, RAD is usually given to kids who are violent, constantly rebelling, and have no attachments at all. I never once was violent towards my parents or even threatened them, and my “acting out” was me texting my girlfriend at the time behind their back because I knew the consequences if they found out. My parents were also heavily involved in the church. I had good grades in school, never had issues with other kids besides typical teenage drama, never used any substances until I graduated (good ol’ MJ but nothing more). I did struggle with SH and my entire mood would be dictated around my girlfriend at the time, and I did feel as if I would pass away without her. However, those feelings never manifested through anger outwardly. 

 I was sent to the institute for attachment and  child development in Colorado, who’s notoriously known for mistreating and even taking the life of children. Just look up Candance Newmarker for reference, she was a victim to the same administration under a different name. The results of the treatment left me with years of trauma and it wasn’t until I was an adult when I got the BPD diagnosis and started doing therapy for it when I finally started healing. Therapy/meds for bpd has truly changed my life for the better, while therapy and meds from the RAD places made me even worse than I already was. 

I can’t seem to find any solid research on the differences between BPD and RAD and how detrimental it is to treat someone with BPD (who doesn’t have RAD) as if they had RAD.

19,How to process guilt (sfw) (trigger warning)(seeking advice),"Trigger warning: DV 
**************



I (24f) have been struggling with bpd since I was in high school. I restarted seeing a therapist in august of last year after I got out of the hospital and was put on meds. I still struggle a lot with lashing out in anger which is what this post is about. Last night I got really angry with my boyfriend. It was over something really stupid. It’s no excuse but he was pushing my buttons so bad and I laid my hands on him. At first I didn’t mean to hurt him and then I realized I was getting way too rough. Today I feel like shit. He’s obviously really mad at me because I hurt him but I want him to forgive me. I understand he needs to process but the guilt is overwhelming me. I’ve begged for forgiveness over and over and he won’t say he accepts it. We can’t even look at each other. Does anyone have any advice for processing guilt when you’ve done something wrong? How do you come to terms that they’re not ready to forgive you yet? Is there anything I can do to right the situation? 

My meds were changed a few days ago so I don’t know if the increased anger could be a side affect.

22,Last night I almost :/ ended things TW: SI and SU,"Backstory: I’ve been dealing with the thoughts my whole life, had a couple attempts and ended up in the mental hospital more than I want to count. Was diagnosed bipolar but new that wasn’t me so I continued life not knowing what really is up. A couple months ago I met with a online doctor she diagnosed me with BPD and said that she couldn’t treat me or give me meds bc of the state my SI thoughts are in. Every single day and I cannot help it. So I’ve been struggling alone and no one seems to care. I’ve been drinking way to much this past year, about a 750 ml every 3 days. I go to bed sick and pass out. 

Currently, last night: what triggered the thoughts was a phone call with a close family member. The call went fine and the person didn’t do anything wrong but I couldn’t stop thinking about how terrible I am, how I talk to much, how embarrassing I am, how no one can stand me, my own husband ect and I’m so tired of making a fool out of myself. I’m tired of existing and failing. After dinner I asked my husband to take my son with him and get us some ice cream, I wanted to be alone.. you get the point. I know it sounds pathetic but I thought that was my only chance and if I didn’t do it then I would keep suffering and things have not ever got better, I don’t want to live in pain anymore.

TW: idk if I’m allowed to talk about the details this is my first post on here. But here it goes- I grabbed my husbands hand *** and loaded it. Finished up my note that’s been sitting in my phone for a while and put it up to my head. I then got scared and couldn’t do it. Thinking of SI is one thing (sounds easy enough, sounds like a release) but in the actual moment I was actually scared of the pain. Finally I heard my husband pull back up the house so I quickly put everything back up. I went out like everything was normal and he went to where the stuff was and said “WHY WERE YOU MESSING WITH MY STUFF” I said I wasn’t and he called me a child and said “wow now I can’t even keep these in the house” he unloaded them all. I he kept verbally harassing me. I put my son to bed and slept in our guest room and he hasn’t talked to me since. 

Now I feel so embarrassed and alone. He makes me feel pathetic. I know I am. I’m barely hanging on and no one seems to care. I have told my mother and close people how bad it is and they said “sorry maybe you should get on meds “ I’ve been on soo many different types of meds my whole life and it was a nightmare, felt like I was living in a shell.

25,"When you split on someone, is the tone always angry? Is splitting ever done in a measured tone but nonetheless very black and white?","My partner with BPD recently broke up with me out of the blue, days after saying she wants to be with me forever. The breakup occured when she was in the middle of a very stressful week at work, and I was too busy writting the final med school exams to support her.

When ending things, she painted an incredibly one-sided and distored picture of the relationship where I never made efforts or sacrifices. The whole thing was very black and white. While I was imperfect, she left out very key information and believed a narrative that i sincerely believe to be untrue.

27,I’m new here,"My most recent psych doctor suggested I have BPD, and it honestly lines up with my symptoms. I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around it. I’ve always had the extreme mood changes, and the thing where if someone does something “against” me, I will think of them like an enemy, if that makes sense. I had pretty significant trauma in my childhood and I’ve heard that’s common for this diagnosis. I’m also in recovery from alcoholism and an eating disorder. One good thing about it, is that I switched to DBT in therapy which I like, and have tried new meds like a mood stabilizer in addition to an SSRI, which never worked alone. I’m not as suicidal, like I was for awhile. So there’s progress. I just, I have this overlaying feeling that to my core, I am damaged/broken/unworthy. Like there is something wrong with me. It gets worse when I have to interact with other people, and I feel so awkward and overthink everything. But when I don’t interact with other people, I isolate and the obsessive thoughts of unworthiness gets worse. I’m ranting, I know. I’ve never posted here or really talked to anyone about this besides my therapist. I guess I’m looking for support? Tools? Connection? This shits hard.

35,"Follow up - How to stop being abuser TW: SI, SA, ABUSE","Hello. 
Some time ago I posted here about being afraid of parpatuating in cycle of abuse. Since then some things have changed. 

I still feel guilty for my past. I still feel like a bad person and I still feel lost. But at the same time thanks to therapy and meds I was able to break the pattern.

Long story short I was in long distance relationship for past two months. Me and my boyfriend tried to work it out. Unfortunally he wanted to stay in a place where he currently is, because it is better than my country for him. I can't immigrate now because college in my country is free while in the USA where he is I would have to pay. And although I love him and I would immigrate it would be in a time when I finished college and gained more financial stability - I have problems with impulsive spendings - so It was hard for us. We drift Apart and although both of us tried we both weren't happy. Me especially because as a pwBPD I am triggered by abondoment and distance. And the first plan was he would come back to my country in 5 months time when he gets his papers in check. 

So at Sunday we broke up. It wasn't easy decision. I think we both took it very hard. But I am proud to say that I broke the cycle. I would split on him even back in March when we met. I would harras him, I would beg him to comeback even threathend to hurt myself. And just to him, but to my parents and friends as well. I would probably be institiunalized again or at least took to ER. But this time I blocked him. Not because I hate him. I am hurt, sad, deppresed but I don't hate him. I finally see the other side the other person feelings even though my heart is bledding. I see past my hurt feelings and unmet needs. 

So for anyone in similar situation: block your ex. Delete all of the contacts, reminders etc. Go to therapy. Practice mindfullness, meditation, yoga. Focus on other stuff. Do whatever neccesary to not cause harm to you or your ex, especially if they were your FP. Let yourself be angry, hurt, dissapointed. But don't took it onto yourself or the other person. Don't split. It is hard. But therapy and meds help.

If anyone Has the same guilt and shame as me and is afraid that they can't change let this be an example. And also don't beat yourself up if you fucked up. Healing takes a lot of time and work. You won't be perfect, I am not Perfect. But we can heal.

i was confused - i asked my friend if she too has disorganised mind, like thoughts might be non linear, shaped as other stuff, basically i have a mess in my head and thoughts only start to make sense when i am telling them, without preparation. she said no. 
I've researched and found out that BPD was morphed with Schizotypal PD some decades ago, they were intertwined, and some people with BPD  might or might not have symptoms of schizotypal. 
i guess my core problem is due to this. i am losing feelings. i still can rage, or argue, or feel hypomaniac, but its all flat. when i am not triggered i feel like i have no emotions at all. i lost ability to feel love, romantic feelings, i just don't feel anything even if the person i try it with is meeting all of my criteria for a cool bf.
the only ""love-like"", limerence, i feel towards my ex, but we parted 3 years ago and now he has a gf and bla bla bla.... but its not a string feeling, it's like auto pilot

This is my first post ever on Reddit. I need support from people who also have BPD. 

I am 22f and I was properly diagnosed with BPD last year although I suspected it for a long time. I always had troubles with impulsivity, deppresion and emotional Control. Last year I fully realize how bad I am even though I was in therapy for almost two years at this time. It started when my boyfriend broke up with me. I Had a relationship before but this was first more long term. We were living together for couple months. 

I am acknowlegding that we had problems on his side, but I was more impulsive abusive and awful, because my mental Health was awful. I just got out from my parents house, was adjusting to new work, new city and was dealing with relative that Had dementia and unfourtunally died at the end of 2021. I am not saying this to demish what I did which included intensive splitting, arguing, trying to keep it through being FwB even though it was hurting us both etc. This land me in group therapy which I couldn't handle, because I really had a hard time hearing critism and taking full accountability for what I did. 

My question is does anybody else deal with a guilt after being abusive partner or is afraid of repeating the pattern? If so does it get easier and can you fully recover from it and be a good partner?

I am in New relationship since March this year and I am just afraid. Especially that It is long distance.. I don't want to hurt anybody else or myself. The guilt is sometimes overwhelming.

Then this person I like so much, I am there to listen to when they want but if I want them to listen to me, the things I am going through, then it becomes negativity, them not wanting to talk, or having no time cause they are busy. On top of that when they start telling me to do this and do that, its fine but when it's the other way, I am irritating them by repeating the same thing again and again. I miss them so much, its not like we see each other everyday and then I am still asking them to be on phone with me, parents, therapists, helplines, all are so damned useless. I am totally burned out. I cannot do this anymore. Its a hell, I see no way out of. I try my best to keep myself calm, focus on other things but every morning it's waking up heavy hearted. I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up. Yeah, I am overflowing with negativity and anyone I turn around to ask for help has to first criticize me for I wasted 10 years in med school without completing it, wasting my parents money when I could have let go way back in 2016-2017 when my fees was not paid on time and I wasn't allowed to write exams and although I didn't want to do this course, I still hanged on in the hope my parents will make things right at the financial front. So yes, hoping that things will get better was and is still my fault, I do agree I act out impulsively at times.

51,(TW) Bpd x bpd relationship. Advice?,"Hi. I never use reddit and just made this account like 10 mins ago so please excuse if I'm not really doing this right. And sorry for the length I've added a ""TLDR"" at the end (is that how you do it?)
TW Substance abuse, Institutions, Suicidal Ideation, Psychosis, Police Brutality, Eating Disorders (possible other tw I forgot to mention)
I am F20 dating someone with bpd M24. We have known each other a year now (started relationship April 2023 then both didnt talk for 3 months May 2023-Sep 2023 because we both went to rehab in different places) and honestly the way we met kinda.. will raise some red flags for some people but honestly I am not looking for anyone to comment on that aspect. We met in a psych ward in April 2023. Both at super low points. I was in a severe manic/psychotic episode as I also struggle with bipolar disorder. I had stayed up for 4 nights straight and maybe eaten 2 meals during that time. When I got there I weighed under 100 pounds. I was having delusions and convinced myself I had alters. I had no idea that the guy I was with was giving me weed that was laced with benzos. He also had laid hands on me and cheated during the relationship as well. I didnt even find out I tested positive for the benzos until a while later. The psychward I went to was absolutaly disgusting and also didn't tell me I had very abnormal blood levels and forced psych meds down my throat. I don't even think it was the right time to start those meds with my weight and health issues and substances in my body. It was pretty much medical abuse. And it was my second ever time, besides when I was 16, going to a mental hospital. My boyfriend, on the other hand, was considered a ""frequent flyer."" He struggled with lots of substance abuse and suicidal thoughts. I would find out later that he admitted himself this time because he was feeling awful about not having his old FP. When I first saw him, he mentioned having BPD in a group therapy and explaining how it was affecting him. My ears perked up listening to him. He was just a great talker, vulnerable, and accountable for himself. I don't remember a lot from when we first met because of all the different things going on with my brain, but I talked to him by passing him a note (I think the note may have been about the staff at the psych ward.) We both began talking the whole time we were there after that. There was absolutely no activities, the staff treated us like utter garbage, and we both were too restless to just sit around all day. We would talk ""walks"" down the hallways just talking. About everything. There was so much chemistry. He somehow knew how exactly to calm me down. We both knew how to make eachother laugh. He was optimistic, despite how awful different circumstances he had were. Way more optimistic than me. He pointed out a big photo on the wall of a colorful wave and said to pretend we were taking a walk on the beach together.  We also did have one activity room we would go in maybe once out of the whole week that had a piano and some playing cards. I played Heart and Soul as a duet with him. We somehow made that awful situation we were in into something enjoyable. As days passed, he started opening up about how he had a charge of battery on an officer. Basically, he was in the same mental hospital we were in at the time, and he was having an episode. He is a black man with tattoos, so everyone just treated him as if he was dangerous and aggressive before he even got to any point like that. I don't know exactly what happened, but they didn't attempt to deescalate at all. A police officer came over to slam him against the wall and tell him ""you'd be better off dead."" He then spit in the officers direction. And that's it. He didn't hit him or attempt to hit him.  Because of covid, that action he took is considered battery against a police officer, and he was looking at a minimum of 10 years in prison for it. The case is still ongoing as we speak. He's doing a mental health diversion to get the felony off his record, and he's trying to get the case dropped. If the case is dropped, he plans to sue. So basically, everything has been extremely stressful for both of us the entire time we have known each other. But we connect so well. I have never felt so much love and passion for someone. After the mental hospital, we hung out for weeks. We did smoke a lot of weed together and both of us started getting worse mentally. I got sent to psych 2 more times after the first time and then got transferred to residential on the 3rd time. The 3rd time I went was because I went to his house, had severe psychosis, and he had to call the police on me. We weren't really together for quite a few months and I even broke off talking to him because I needed to recover. Then, I reached out again in September. We both relapsed, and I would see him once a week so my use was weekly and his was daily. He lives with his mother who has a medical card and gives him free weed. Now, we both are over 2 weeks sober and plan to stay that way. But the relationship had gotten tense and strained. We don't use escapism for our feelings anymore. We even quit nicotine. We started eating healthy, exercising, and finding ourselves. But it's so hard. I know people say two sick people can't get better together, but I just want to prove them wrong. I want us to be healthy. So many things make us insecure. We are both terrified of losing each other. We both want to get out of our triggering households together. But we both struggle with things. I'm going back to regular talk therapy and he's about to start his therapy too. I even want to do couples therapy. But money is a huge issue. He couldn't work for the entire time we have been together. I've only had a part-time retail job that pays 13 an hour. He's been mad that I'm working way more and seeing him less. I'm trying to explain that I'm doing this for us. It hurts him because he wants to be a caretaker and he wants to be the breadwinner. But realistically, I'm the one who can work rn. And I'm even struggling with that as well because I got in a car accident in an Uber and my back is messed up. The pain is making me constantly irritated. Please. I know a lot of people might say this doesn't seem like it's possible it could work, but I want some optimism. Me and him both want it to work and are willing to do anything we possibly can to make it work. Any advice is so appreciated. Thank you.

52,Just blew up and fucked things up ,"Would go to the normal BPD sub but I was banned for a no good reason. 
So basically I have BPD, ADHD, and some other things. I am not medicated for the ADHD due to my psychiatrist being a piece of shit. Today I looked at my grades (I’m in college) and I’m failing two of my classes because I’m unable to focus and get work done, I procrastinate a lot and I put my boyfriend above everything because he’s my ‘favorite person’. I am so fed up with being misunderstood and not listened to by my psychiatrist and I’m feeling incredibly impulsive, like criminally impulsive if you get what I’m getting at. I am so angry. I blew up on my mom and boyfriend and I’m at work right now so they are not with me but I was spamming them with texts and calls telling them I’m going to do something impulsive or hurt myself. My boyfriend is now mad at me and won’t talk to me because I scared him which is totally reasonable. I know I’m a bad person sometimes. But I am just so angry that they won’t put me on a stimulant to help me. I had anorexia but I’ve been in recovery for a year now and my eating disorder therapist cleared me for a stimulant but my psychiatrist won’t talk to her and she keeps putting me on diff meds like lithium and qelbree. I never took the lithium because I’ve been on too many mood stabilizers and anti psychotics and I don’t wanna turn into a zombie again. I’m not taking the qelbree because it’s not a stimulant. I’ve taken adderal before, and it helped so much. I would only take it on school days though because I like being frenzied when I’m sewing or working on my creative stuff. I don’t know what to do anymore, it feels like my world is crashing down around me and I’m starting to get those minor hallucinations and my mom said that I’m acting deranged right now. Which I think I am because of the things I said. I Can be so mean when i go thru episodes like this and I say some really fucked up shit. I just can’t keep living like this. Does anyone experience the same thing? Have any suggestions? Should I just continue to self medicate? I feel like I’m going crazy. Trust me the texts I sent were very very bad. I feel so guilty now. I want to punish myself. But I’ve made it so far (I used to self harm daily and had many attempts but I’ve been clean from those for a year now) I can’t fall back into those habits. I don’t know what to do. Yes I’m trying to get a new psychiatrist.

54,I’m the BPD loved one and the one that has to step away,"
In a nutshell, my fiancée and I ended things little less than a month ago. My BPD took over and I became a person neither of us could continue to love. I miss her more than anything, there is and never had been a lack of love in our relationship but there was a good amount of drama and trauma on both ends.   I wish more than anything we could be friends and be in each others lives but I unfortunately broke the trust I was granted and I can’t do that anymore. I have to keep her safe from the dark parts of me and though I’m feeling as if I’m starting to heal I still need to step away. I can’t hurt her or myself anymore.   It’s so hard being so in love with someone, being capable of being nice and civil  and being able to be there for them but knowing that the reason you can’t do these things is because you love each other too much.    


I don’t think you’re on here but if you are…  I’m gonna miss you. I’m gonna hope every day that you’ll reach out but I’m not gonna hate you if you don’t. I won’t even be mad if you don’t.  I just pray you take care of yourself and I pray for your healing.

58,Husband is crushing me,"Hi, 

I have had BPD sine 14 my husband of 5 Years knows this and has been great during that time. I pretty much have it under control for the most part (therapy and meds) But my anxiety has been rising since corona started, so I went back to the doctor to get myself figured out before it gets out of hand. 

&#x200B;

We have been having difficult conversations about our relationship lately I think he is depressed but don't want to push him to do anything. Either way yesterday he hit me with this question: 

&#x200B;

How do you tell someone you love that you might not love them? How do you know that ""the one"" is not out there or how do you know if you already found that person? 

&#x200B;

We evaluate our Relationship on a regular basis as I consider this healthy (More for my benefit to make sure its me and not the BPD that is controlling anything) But this has sent me reeling. We were planning on starting a family next year and I now wake up feeling horrible every morning. I feel better once the day progresses and I go through the Mantra of You are good enough, you are not an inconvenience etc. 

&#x200B;

Is it time for me to have a harder look at this relationship? It really hurts when he says things like that but I sometimes don""t trust my judgement about it. I felt hurt and angry after that statement yesterday... today I am mostly numb... 

&#x200B;

I dont even know what I want out of this message advice, perspective? Anyone going though anything similar? 

 As a side note when we met he was super duper in a depressive episode and I literally had to drag his ass into my psychiatrist office. This helped him back in the day with therapy and meds but I think it might be coming back? or am I just wishing for it to me a different reason than he not loving me?

62,So Stuck RN,"I have had periods of being very well emotionally regulated, mostly when I am modeling good behaviors/actions for others. What ultimately happens is I am so focused on others that I forget to tend to myself. I’ve had a few bottoms. One came during the plague with social isolation. I then got a WFH job and social engagements got super hard for me. Looking back I can almost see my self completely unwind. Stop going to gym, stop journaling, stop meditating, stopped taking showers, changing clothes, brushing teeth, then stopped taking my medications bc if I take the ADHD meds I feel locked inside my head and almost paralyzed on the outside. By this time my head had 8 different trains of thought on 6 tracks and at least one wants me to unsubscribe from life and they constantly whirl around up there. I asked for accommodations from my company and they then found a reason to fire me (Top sales rep, most customer compliments) and I tail spun. 

So I swore I would unsubscribe from life before giving up my 325ft studio apartment (bc it was mine and I paid for it all by myself) and move back in with my parents. Soooo…..my brother let me crash with him. My head was so dark and so mean to me that getting out of bed seemed impossible. Sublet the studio to someone who is trashing it and also wants to sleep with me. (Uggggg)

So now, I have done EMDR, ART, DBT, CBT and I’m therapy and have a psych and I’m still in this rut where I JUST DONT CARE ABOUT MYSELF AT ALL ANYMORE. It’s like the spark or fire went out. I can’t seem to find it. Brother was paying for top tier therapy and now it’s been downgraded to better help. He’s upset he’s not getting a return on investment bc I haven’t been able to be more regulated for the last 2 years. 

I’ve gained over 100lbs in 2 years thanks to gastroparesis from Weygovi/Ozempic/Rybelsus. 

I now have a bedroom that I operate out of and while my brother can be super encouraging and supportive, lately I only hear what I’m doing bad/wrong.

Now dad has had heart issues, step sis going thru divorce from a narcissist - she has two kids 4/9 and she’s a flight attendant with her own Truman’s manifesting in such dysfunction rn. (Which is effecting the kids)

I can show up for my dad and step sis and my niece and nephew and lately, I put the very disassociated mask on where I’m modeling good behaviors, showering, changing clothes, doing laundry, doing sisters dishes and laundry and going to doctor appointments. Did I make my psych appt this month…nope. Dad in hospital. 

When those duties/obligations end…..I deflate back into a dark hole who doesn’t really care if I see tomorrow. 

2018-2022 I racked up over 30k in debt, so there’s a bankruptcy that gets to happen, and I’ve asked multiple people to be my body double so I can sit down and get the information I need so I can file it. Currently, if I go back to work, one of my more aggressive lenders will get a judgement and garnish my wages. It’s so traumatizing for me that I did this to myself that I don’t feel safe doing it alone. 

I filed for disability bc it’s actually proving that me acting as the Geico duck in the boat plugging all the multiple holes (my family’s needs) is enough to be a full time job and I have adhd, ptsd, BPD, anxiety, agoraphobia, social anxiety. I don’t have clothes that fit. So I have mostly pajamas. I hate going in public and won’t do social things. And I’m so dysregulated rn that I couldn’t imagine working part or full time doing anything. 

I don’t know how or when we crossed that tipping line of full heartedly believing that my life is worthless. I don’t matter, I don’t want to be here, and have made certain promises to not do the thing I really want to do while parents are alive, or in family’s house. (This is one area where black and white thinking is helping me.) I care more about NOT inflicting trauma on my family than I care about myself.

I very much wish that I felt/believed/desired like I was capable of going back to giving a fuck, and taking my meds, and showering and looking forward to working out, wanting to be social, enjoying life rather than I have XYZ task that drains my batteries and takes all my spoons so now I need 4 days to recharge. It’s exhausting. 

I cannot seem to create and keep a routine bc nothing is routine. I’m pulled to take care of the kids or dad has new appts nearly every week. I’ve lost enjoyment and fulfillment in the things that used to make me happy like painting or singing. 

Everything hurts, every muscle aches. I don’t feel like stretching helps.

I find that I am seeing or aware of every flaw of my body and limitations since gaining all this weight. I could go on and on.

I’m getting frustrated at my limitations and when the frustration hits I’m not able to positively spin it to find a way to overcome it, the frustration is too loud and draining and before I can even acknowledge it and catch it to try to reframe it, my batteries are dead. 

I don’t know where to start or what to do first. I assume it’s one little thing to the next. I just don’t know how to do it when i genuinely don’t want to be here and don’t care. I am truly stuck. Like stuck stuck. 

Anyone with any experience with this apathy and stuckness, I’d really like some help from people who have been where i am and found a way to care again.

I live in the US and our mental health resources are limited and sorely underfunded and my family doesn’t have the resources to put me in a nice place for 90 days that would force me to have a routine.

it\`s really hard and because of my emotions i feel like suicide is the only option, especially when my bf tells me about the time they spend together.

what should i do???

if that\`s important, i only take meds now and don\`t have the opportunity to go to a therapist + i\`ve been through multiple abusive relationships.",1588853915.0,False,4,5,lasdehnennnheart,None,gf5gk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/gf5gk8/dating_problems/
64,FRUSTRATION STATION,"Hey all. Thanks for having me here. 

I'm (27 FtM) struggling to prioritize in my life. Having finally gotten some self awareness on the borderline patterns of attachment, obsession, and trying to break out of this cycle of centering my life around unattainable or unavailable people, living in fantasy worlds, being super self absorbed, venting and only talking to people when I want attention, validation etc. that is keeping me from moving forward, gaining skills, etc. Everyone is so frustrated with me and I have had to come to terms with being emotionally abusive/neglectful to my ex, neglectful at my jobs and of my pets and self. 

It feels very awkward and unnatural and forced to try to be consistent in friendship, my habits, life. I never have had serious addictions besides social media and other peoples approval. 

Im exhausted. But I know I do have habits and can form new ones because I definitely have bad ones like laying in bed all morning or spending a lot of time in my head. 
Its just that every single day my mood is different even on mood stabilizers and I'm used to doing what I feel like impulsively based on mood, or what I'm forced to do. Which is a surefire way to spin out of control or feel hopeless. I need to develop my OWN locus of control and discipline and its just shitty that my moods are the enemy when they so badly crave validation after decades of gaslighting and being blamed for their intensity and destructive power. 

Im wondering for those who are actively recovering...what has really really helped you out of old coping mechanisms? What were you able to commit to?

I am PDA autistic and have ADHD or bipolar, still waiting on a psych evaluation, but one of my biggest struggles is finding something to be consistent with that doesn't end up trashed by demand avoidance or getting bored/splitting on it. 

Every kind of routine or demand outside of my fixations ends up feeling like swallowing pills or pinching your nose to eat something nasty until I just stop. 

 Everyone says to fight depression, meditate find hobbies and get outside yourself find something to do for others, exercise. 
But I legitimately feel my habits and mental copes are like gravity or a black hole and getting out of them or making changes in life exhausts me and I collapse back into them. 

I guess this is just what recovery is like. But I've tried Codependents Anonymous, talk therapy, astrology, divination, meds (except ADHD meds about to start those), being more social, creative expression. At the end of the day my brain always finds a way to invalidate destroy or get convinced that thing ""isn't it."" The only thing I come back to is taking pictures on my phone (never organized) and writing long rants on the internet. Im so bored of my SELF. And analyzing myself and recounting my past trauma.. everyone else seems to somehow find something to do, or to love, or commit to,, even when we have the same diagnosis and experiences. 
Ughhhhhhhhhh. 

Is it really possible to form an identity and learn how to commit? 

I'm so tired from fighting myself. 

It feels like a normal life is just within reach if I could follow the steps (apply for jobs, show up to jobs, budget the money, move put of home state, take care of my body, cook and eat, have a creative routine, go on a run, care for my pet, evaluate which relationships are good to have around, spend time in nature, set boundaries, learn time management, learn emotional regulation) so I can get to a place where I feel stable enough to really connect with others and not sabotage everything or get hurt because I picked someone wrong.

 But those steps feel so impossible when I keep proving to myself over and over that I will not stick with anything, I will sabotage everything, and every single day I have a new idea about my next big project or career path or what ever. 

How do you build trust with yourself or anyone else without consistent effort? 
The only way I feel motivated is to get a FP or romantic interests approval, or extreme outside pressure and fear of punishment. 

Im just so frustrated I could scream for days. 

Does it get better? And how! Does DBT help with this? 

Consistency is literally the key to unlocking life, and I feel like someone tossed it into a vat of concrete Im supposed to chip away at with my fingernails.

65,trying to be a happy adult,"As a quick question, what do you guys do to cope with bpd or heal from traumas? Especially without a therapist or medication 

I actually had therapy and meds since I was 13/14 years old, till I was 20 last year I stopped using my parents insurance because I completely distanced myself from my family and honestly everyone all my friends from the past because they all just were shit to me. 

After I left rehab when I was 17, I still had my bpd symptoms but I experienced a weird like 2 years just not feeling real. I don't remember much of that but I just really dissociated all the time. 

I started having friends again, smoking more heavily, did risky things more than ever. I even tried almost not even wanting to think about the past, I wanted to reconnect with my family a bit. But pretty much every single of those people ended up really hurting me. There's so much that was happening. My life honestly felt like hell to me, and it hurt my soul that growing up I've always thought about how the hurt seems to only get worse and worse. And here I am wanting to just be okay, start living independently. But my family doesn't give a fuck to admit their mistakes, these friends are all fake, people think I'm weird. I still get anxiety at work hoping customers don't notice or say anything about my arms covered in scars. 

But I'm so tired of suffering from my past wounds I want to just get rid of but why does the pain stay? I know I'll have to struggle with my mental illness, and just try to maintain it. I barely managed to get an insurance but so far it hasn't helped, I hate when these things list places that don't accept them! 

Anyways, any advice?",1654955755.0,False,15,0,punkmexicana,None,v9y366,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/v9y366/trying_to_be_a_happy_adult/
66,Just venting and trying to understand,"im anxious about something, and i just want to vent. i know i made a lot of progress regarding my mental health, and i know i’m more aware of my behaviors and the consequences of those behaviors on others. and even though i was able to let go of some of them, some still linger in my head and i can’t feel anything other than ashamed and fake, like, how can i say i’m better when i still think like this?

to the situation. i have been avoiding making friends, specially because i fear i may do to them what i did to an ex friend and so many others and make someone else suffer because of me, but i got close to a guy in my class and we hang out and talk, normal, but he has other friends, other girls friends, and this sparkles a little fire in my brain that says “he has other friends, clearly you are not enough, so just ghost him and isolate”, and i got so bitter, and sad because he is closer with his other friend than me, and it hurt me. i tried so hard to not think about it, to let go, and to not feel like this, but i can’t seem to avoid it.

it simply made my whole mood go dark and twisted. and this brings me memories of my time together with this ex friend, and how i often felt this exact same way many times. i guess it’s jealousy that comes from fear of abandonment. and now i seem to wonder my thoughts into “see, this is why you can’t have friends, just ditch them nicely and be alone again, it’s better for everyone”. i do therapy and i take my meds daily, and im not in love with the guy, this happens with anyone i try to get close and have a friendship, also i have a bf. its like i cant handle a person im close to having other people that they are close to. i feel at a loss.",1662500879.0,False,8,1,arecatsminerals,None,x7mvqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/x7mvqe/just_venting_and_trying_to_understand/
67,How do you handle conflicting diagnoses from different doctors?,"Ugh I've always thought my psychiatrist was kind of shit, he apparently worships Reagan and only spends like 10 minutes a session with me and keeps asking me if I'm religious and when am I going back to church??? (Left the church years ago having been raised in it and never looked back)

I hate that he doesn't advertise himself as Christian focused but does this to his patients. Anyway... my lovely psychiatrist left and I was handed over to a new one in her office a long time ago. And I feel too over it to care. He gives me my meds, I want to take them at this dose, he agrees whatever. 


But a legitimate psychologist (my therapist) who I find to be very sane, thoughtful, caring, and intelligent has recently diagnosed me with Borderline. I brought this to my psychiatrist of 10ish years and was met with the standard, ""you dont have that, those patients are very hard to deal with, you're very easy to deal with, you dont want that."" I think it's relevant that I'm relatively quiet, with high social anxiety, avoidant, and a  high-functioning variant of Borderline, meaning I can hold a steady full-time office job and a relationship of a couple years. But it's the first in my life longer than 3 months where he isn't abusive. And it really only started being functional after I restarted medications, which I've quit cold turkey several times in my life during depressive episodes.

Ok, first of all, as if I chose to have this disorder. Second, does having BPD necessitate breaking down in front of the psychiatrist and telling him to fucking hurt himself or something?? Does it necessitate a history of alcoholism or inpatient or cutting?  Has he spent more than ten minutes with me in a session in this whole year? Did he give any thought to the diagnosis other than to say ""well, I don't want to deal with another one, so I'm going to deny that's even possible and hope things stay the same""

Like wtf man is it because you think I have a dumb female therapist, Mr. Christian Republican know-it-all? She is a licensed psychologist who has been practicing for decades and has also treated borderlines before. Ofc, he didn't care to find that out, just hurried me out of his virtual office. Fucking making bank off being lazy and careless with patients like me. 

So idk if it's even a conflicting diagnosis, because he seemed not to even look into it or even want to acknowledge it. But my therapist has diagnosed me and we started going through DBT. 

I want to know if any of you have dealt with having your reality questioned by doctors, and how common it really is to be misdiagnosed with BPD, maybe if you really had something else going on. 

I've only heard that it's common to be misdiagnosed with bipolar, but in my case my mood swings are very clearly shorter and attributed to triggering events, I'm def not bipolar. My past diagnoses are complex PTSD, GAD, panic disorder with OCD features, and some mild depressive episodes. 

Anyway, what are your experiences with misdiagnoses?

69,"Wedding got cancelled.
","I know this post is very long but please take the time to read, I really need ur opinions and help on this one🥺🙏🙏

I (20f) and my partner (26m) have been waiting to get married for 6months now, we have been together for 4 years now, engaged for 1. I struggle with bpd but we found this out during the relationship. During our whole relationship it has been rough, when I met him I was very young and had just came out of a very abusive relationship (when I say just it was probably nearly a year later) and was still recovering, he knew this and we made it work anyway. It was great for a while, I started really feeling better with my mental health. Then I got assaulted by one of his friends. ( It's a long story but I won't get into it now) Obviously my mental health degraded after that and I was in and out of hospital and that is when they figured out I had bpd. It was a horrible time in my life and to me felt like forever. Right when all of this was happening COVID hit, my bf lost his house bc his roommates left unexpectedly bc of COVID and he couldn't afford it anymore. So I was still living with my parents at the time and I was SOOO ill that my parents agreed to my bf moving in with us as he was helping so much with my mental health. The plan was always to leave and move in with eachother but life sucks as you all may know. We saved enough money to leave together and work on the other side of world with his dad, we were there for 3 months but to put it short his dad fucked us over and then Brexit happened ( I'm British) so I was not allowed to work basically anywhere and had to leave. So we came back to my parents and decided to get married as we had previously been engaged for a year anyway so we could build the life together that we wanted. So that would have been 6 months since we came back and decided to do all of this, I spent a lot of money on paperwork and got very stressed about it. In this period of time our relationship was under a lot of stress and pressure and let's just say that my bf ""cracked"", I am very patient with him given how patient he was with me and how much he helped me with everything, but I can only put up with so much. He has been shouting at me and calling me names every day for maybe 8 months. So eventually we got to a point where we could finally get married and go away together but because of his behaviour I am not well enough to go now, I had to quit my job due to panic attacks coming back. Had a trip to the hospital and now back on meds and I am physically ill from my anxiety (vomiting, nauseous, not sleeping) We had a very long chat and for obvious reasons have cancelled the marriage because I am not well enough to leave yet and because of how toxic everything has become, he says that he behaved this way because of stress and is very sorry about the whole situation. He wants to stay here for a few months (I don't know how comfortable I am with that) and save up money so that he can leave on his own ( he hadn't been working since we came back which really bugs me) and I have to stay with my parents where they can look after me and I can get the help I need with the psychologist bc where we want to go I will have no insurance or right to it and I NEED it right now. His plan is to work and study at the same time while he is there and then go to uni and after uni come and get me. Which to me seems like a silly plan, I can make a year work but not 4 years. Also I feel like after everything happened it's not really the same anymore between us (I really do love him but it's all a bit too much) I just feel a bit in shock with all of this bc it all happened very fast and suddenly I am now trying to figure out my life. I am 20 with very little work experience and little to no education (I am very intelligent but could not do these things due to panic disorder) I have 0 friends, I only have my mum and dad and we have very little money. I want to move away but it seems nearly impossible on my own and I just feel a bit defeated by this whole situation. Obviously I think being on my own and focusing on my mental health and getting a job that works for me would be the best thing for me rn, but obviously bc of my bpd I am terrified of being alone and it's already hard as it is bc I have no social life apart from him and it been like that for so long that I don't really know where to start. I just don't really know what to do in this situation, he seems to think that if he leaves and does all of this he can make it work between us, but I am not so sure.

72,I cancelled new years eve plans and my gf is still going - I'm sad and mad,"I always hated new years eve, I always spent it alone because I had no friends or on the few occasions I did I cancelled last minute, idk why. I have been with my gf for 2 years and I have spent the last 2 new years eve with her and her friends, and we were supposed to be spending this one as well toghether. 
As soon as New Year's eve was mentioned, I told her that I was really hoping to not go away and celebrate it in our city, but her friends (which I spent also a lot of one on one time with) said that they were thinking about going to the lake house, which is quite far away to get to by train. I mumbled and truly didn't want to go and I asked my gf if we could even hint at staying in genoa, She said it was already all decided and so I didn't even get to express the fact that it was going to be difficult for me be there. So I just followed along the plans, which ultimately became too much for the same exact reason that I told her in the beginning: I have wayyy too many exams and I am stressed because it implies going away for many days rather than spending just one night. So I told her I couldn't go anymore and we initially left it all there, she truly apologised and asked if she could try to talk her friends into doing it here, but ultimalty I said it was already too late, she should have thought of that way earlier, as we had been talking about new years eve for more than a month. I wasn't too angry at first, I was much rather disappointed that she still wanted to go even though I do understand that it is probably her last New years eve with her friends since they are all graduating med school and going different pathways, still I felt like the main priority for her was to spend it with her friends rather than me when presented with the need to spend it with one or the other. This really upset me as I feel like I have been hurt twice - first of all by her not saying anything to her friends when I mentioned it would have been a problem for me still I passively agreed because as soon as I feel someone shutting me down, I am not going to ask again ( I truly don't think she did it maliciously she never asks her friends for anything even if she needs something and I do believe she didn't want to cause any problems), and by her going even though I have decided I can't anymore and I blame it on her since she didn't say anything, that might not have changed the original plan, but could have least let me be honest about my struggle rather than swiping it down the rug. We have been fighting a lot, I am so mad, I am trying not to insult her anymore since the last year it was a fucking mess as she was studying abroad, and this discussion reminded her so much of all the discussions we had while she was away( she wanted do to something i made her feel guilty for not making me enough of a priority and it ended up being a nightmare for her, since she cut off contact with all her friends to try and salvage our relationship, and even though i regret it so much, this doesnt seem to help me change or act better, the only thing that's changed is that i dont verbally abuse her anymore calling all sort of disgusting names.
I don't know what to do or how to cope these days. I feel as I always do this thing where when we have a sort of big plan which involves going on holiday/moving from our city, I tend to not want to go, as a sort of provocation? To test her to see if she would chouse me? Obviously she always fails because people cannot be tested on these things, still my rational brain and emotional brain seem to be 2 separate entities and there is no mediation that lasts long enough for us to stay peaceful. She is now saying she isn't gonna go if we don't find a way to even discuss this in person because she won't go if going away means starting the new year angry and resentful. I think I try to emotionally manipulate her, and I don't know how to change this or how to even come to terms with the fact that I do this that makes my love feel not authentic, wondering even if, and borderlines in general have the capacity to love another person without wanting to bring that person down to your sadness whenever something happens that doesn't go my way. It makes me feel rotten to core, and yet again, I seem to all relate it to myself.

We both went into this relationship saying that our goals were to get married and have kids within a few years. He specifically said he'd like to start working on starting a family within 3 years. It's now been almost 2, and again, we don't even live together. This is because we fight all the time, and because of my BPD, those fights often spiral out of control. I have hurt myself numerous times in front of him (mostly hitting myself, but sometimes more), and I have been physical with him, which I know is never ok. Last night I slapped his arm and he got really mad, understandably. I feel like a stupid kid when I do stuff like this, but also, I am getting older and I want to be settling down and starting a family. It's all I've ever wanted. But my boyfriend says that my negative coping mechanisms make him fearful of what would happen if we lived together. We've already had the police called on us twice, and the second time (which was last month), I was sent to the psych ward against my will for 3 days because I admitted to sometimes thinking about dying. It was horrible and scary and not very helpful at all other than that it got me a prescription for Lexapro. Anyway, I am trying hard.

I just don't understand why I'm good enough to keep being his girlfriend, but not good enough to move forward in our relationship. If I am not giving him what he needs, why doesn't he leave? He says it's because he loves me and has hope that things can change.

75,I can’t believe I’m doing this,"TRIGGER WARNING: suicide, self harm and all that bad mental health stuff. (Sorry if I did that wrong). 

Hi redditors. I’ve never posted before. Thanks for reading and responding if you choose to do so. I’m sorry if the following triggers you or if you are struggling with the same brand of futile terrible I am. 

I’m at a point in my life where I’ve struggled so much and for so long that I’m just exhausted. I’m not angry or bitter or sad anymore; I just want it to be over. I’m tired of being confused all the time, completely disconnected from this thing called ‘life’ everyone seems to be switched into. I’m tired of being panicky and depressed and anxious all at the same time, almost all the time. Im tired of being at the mercy of my insane mood swings where I'm experiencing overlapping interchanges of all these conflicting emotions all day long. I'm tired of crying so often that it feels like my brain is going to explode in my own head and my eyes will just cease to function properly. I’m tired of being dismissed when I say I’m unwell (psychiatrist included) because ‘I’m doing so well’ - I don’t even know what this means or how you could conclude that from someone whose chronically unemployed, can’t finish uni or even leave the house or make eye contact with people without panicking. I feel like an absolute rotting turd most of the time despite what I’m putting out there (which feels to me like a shit show but to other people for some reasons seems completely normal).

People seem to consistently make this crazy assumption that I’m ‘intelligent and capable’ for some reason and therefore I don’t need help. They couldn’t be more wrong. I can’t accomplish basic tasks because I’m emotionally all over the place all the time and trying to do basic human things like pick what to wear in the morning sends me into shame spirals, suicidal thoughts and urges to self harm. I have no control over my emotions or impulses, I’m constantly floating away from my body and nothing feels real. I’m incapable of accepting any kind of affection or goodwill from others without completely self destructing and I don’t want to burden others so my relationships are nonexistent. 

I’ve dealt with thoughts, feelings, urges and attempts of suicide my entire life. Its pretty much always been a terrifying backup in the back of my mind ever since I can remember as a safety plan to escape the torture of life where I can always feel exactly how close I am to death. Some days feel a magnetism to it but a strong resolve to resist. Other days, I’m basically hanging on by a thread and not telling anyone so they don’t come and take me from my home against my will again. 

I just want the freedom to be able to make this decision on my own. I did not give consent to be born, and I don’t think it’s ethical to keep someone alive against their will when they are suffering chronically and there isn’t a solution. 

I just feel like there’s no way out. I don’t respond to medications and suffer from such severe side effects that my psychiatrist refuses to prescribe any more drugs. My old psychiatrist had me on 5 different meds and I was equally bad, maybe worse, but in a completely different way. Those who have had adverse reactions to medications will understand this. Being mentally ill or being on psychiatric medication is like choosing if you want death by drowning or self-immolation.

I do DBT group therapy, see a psychologist and psychiatrist but I still feel like absolute shit. Everyone seems to be going through the motions, ticking all the boxes, but I just feel like nothing has really shifted. No amount of bandaids is going to help me when I’m walking around absolutely raw with no fucking skin on my body. It’s excruciating to just be alive but because it’s not visible, and it’s a slow death, nobody cares and the state ‘has a responsibility’ to keep you alive. In my experience, everyone is all sad when someone kills them selves, but also calls them selfish because they’ve left so much pain in their wake. Being passed around a mental health care system that can’t really help you, is insanely expensive and practically useless makes me miss the days when I didn’t seek help, suffered in silence but could at least hold on to the hope that there was a possibility of getting better if I had the right help. Now I know that’s not even an option. 

I’m just doomed to relive this cycle of extreme pain, possible suicide, absurdity, exhaustion, sheer terror, panic attacks, extreme mood swings, paranoia, catatonia, confusion, dissociation, spontaneous stuttering, paralysis and fatigue, where I can’t seem to express myself clearly no matter how hard I try or connect with other people. 

I am incapable of feeling positive emotions. No matter how hard I try, I just can’t stop the anxiety, panic, negativity, paranoia and depression from seeping in. I fear my emotions, I fear my thoughts and the things in life I can’t control that are going to hurt me so I just live in a constant state of sheer paralysis, frozen in fear and bracing myself for impact.

The only thing that’s keeping me alive is the thought that my sister will have to deal with the trauma of my suicide. But it also seems like it should be unethical to keep a person in this much chronic pain alive. I can feel my body deteriorating, my mind is basically scrambled eggs at this point, and I feel like I’m at the mercy of an emotionally handicapped body that I have zero control over. I keep harming myself and those around me. I just want to die with a little bit of dignity but there doesn’t seem to be a way out.

Life seems to be one trauma after the next, and continued reluctant attempts to help myself that only end up in things getting worse. I was not made for this world. I wasn’t supposed to be here. Please let me go. I don’t want to hurt anyone but I’m so tired now. Please tell me this will all be over soon.",1596368916.0,False,12,7,sarahthehumanperson,None,i2asxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/i2asxt/i_cant_believe_im_doing_this/
76,I don't know why I have BPD,"this is very long and i dont expect anyone to read it, its basically a breakdown of my life and how i went from a good little christian kid to whatever the fuck is going on with my life now
my bpd confuses me. I've always joked that I've was born with a broken heart because during my childhood, I can't really remember anything traumatic happening to me and I had a good home life, yet I loved sad music and I remember being very young, like 3-4 and praying to God (I was just raised religious and I am a trans man and those things did not mix well even though I didn't realize my gender identity was the cause of a lot of unrecognized dysphoria that I thought was just due to the fact that I was chubby until I was a Junior in high school) to take me to heaven now whenever I got yelled at. In middle school I always felt left out and inadequate. In high school, I was not popular and was never once pursued romantically or had reciprocated feelings for any of my classmates. And although I wasn't bullied, my roommate (religious boarding school)freshman often snuck out of our room to go hang out with our other friend and I remember spending nights crying and wondering why I wasn't enough for her. I started experiencing depressive episodes during the winter and during my sophomore year I tried to seek help because it wasn't going away during the spring this time and was met with a ""you seem fine you've got that real Jesus joy in your heart"". and then junior year I went into a depressive episode that hasn't really seemed to lift completely to this day. I cut myself daily and isolated myself a lot and started gaining weight, something that I hated because I was already overweight and hated my body. I remember praying and crying and wondering why I was feeling like this and why this was happening to me. I viewed myself as lazy, worthless, unloveable, and a complete failure at the ripe age of 17. I lost my faith, my ambitions, everything. I also realized that I was bisexual and trans and this further worsened the depression because I knew my parents would not approve. I was hiding everything from them and trying to hold myself together and ""cure"" myself by using a horrible system of cutting myself for not completing chores/homework that I needed to complete but had 0 motivation or energy to do. I wanted to take my life, but before I could work up the nerve to I opened up to my parents about how I was feeling about everything about the LGBT stuff. they got me an online Christian counselor who helped but I was still dealing with the LGBT aspects of my issues because I was afraid of being kicked out of my school or being sent to conversion therapy. I knew I couldn't deny these aspects of my identity because I knew they were things that I couldn't change, the problem was that every single person in my life was, although most not aggressively, homophobic and transphobic. I saw a light of sorts at the end of the tunnel at graduation, and I figured if I could just make it out of high school and shatter the glass ceiling on my current life, then everything would be better. Senior year I took Lexapro and it didn't really seem to help, but I continued to take it. Unfortunately I gained more weight because of binge eating and was around 240lbs, not that much but I was easily one of the largest people in my school. I had an online girlfriend who told me she loved me and then later said she never meant it when we broke up. I started smoking cigarettes and weed and spent a lot of my time alone because half of the time when I tried to hang out with anyone I felt like I didn't really belong. I felt like a lot like I was on the outside of my own life and looking in. At this point I was also very bad and still am at taking care of myself, which I am very embarrassed about and am working on. I didn't shower as much as I should, I woke up with only 5 minutes to get to class, and really just kind of blundered through life because I was using all my energy on just keeping myself alive. Finally, I graduated, and things looked like they were getting better. I came out to my parents, and my previous good relationship with them tanked. things were weird, they acted like I was this whole new person but I still felt like I was just me. This hurt because of the obvious disapproval of the true me, in identity and opinions and personal values. this is still a source of contention with my dad mostly but I've learned to just tolerate his unacceptance of my gender identity. I felt alone and ostracized in my own house and college was the way I finally began to branch out into the real world. I met my best friend, began smoking weed daily which I think has proven mostly beneficial to me but I will not deny this may be problematic as well. I hung out with my new friend and then her friends who have become most of my current social circle daily and was never in the house. I took a break from college which turned into dropping out because I was changing career paths and found my passion in dog grooming, which was great. as I worked and had money to spend though, problems began arising. at this point I had started to feel somewhat out of control of myself, staying up too late before working in the morning, starting to do party drugs occasionally like Ecstasy, ect. while at home feeling like I was stuck in the past. I noticed that when I was out with my friends and living my own life, I was happy and although erratic and overly sensitive to feeling the need to belong and be inlcluded in everything, but as soon as i stepped foot through the door of my house i could feel my mood start to tank. I only even slept on nights when i worked in the morning. I felt the need to be able to do everything with my new friends and keep up, and i deeply needed them to like me. I was still unhappy with my weight, although beginning to like my appearance as i was able to present as my true gender. I am a hopeless romantic and have always wanted to settle down and get married. I had a lot of trouble finding love and felt unnattractive and undesirable. I also spent my money impulsively and was often broke and struggled to make it through a week on a part time paycheck. Because i spent so much time away from home and didn't have much money, I often skipped meals in favor of a pack of cigs or whatever random thing i was focused on. Because i was eating less and stiffled my appetite with cigarettes, i started to notice a loss of weight. I have never been athletic and especially now since i ran myself ragged constantly socializing or working, I've never consistently worked out or really seen any weight loss. So I started to skip meals on purpose occasionally and not just to save money. I desperately wanted to be skinny, something I've never been. It didnt get to be a problem until later when i really started to drop weight. First though, in late 2018 I met my current boyfriend and although it's only been about a year and a half, I'm certain he's the love of my life, and he feels the same. However, with all good things there are problems. He had a rough childhood and because of it has a lot of very difficult mental problems himself. At this point, i had stopped taking my meds after beginning walbutrin to combat how dull lexapro made me feel emotionally at times. I didnt like how irritable it made me and i barely remembered to take my meds anyways, and i was feeling elated with a new relationship and thought it was a good idea. i don't regret it because although i spiralled into a depression enough to admit myself to a hospital for a short while. They diagnosed me with bipolar 2 which didnt really seem to fit right since the hospital seemed to diagnose everyone with some kind of bipolar disorder and gave everyone abilify, the worst medication i have ever taken. Meanwhile, my boyfriend, B, was going through one of the worst mental health years of his life, and I tried to support him the best that I could. I definitely tended to ignore my own needs to help his objectively much more serious issues. I was also doing more drugs and just got a promotion from bather to groomer and had to transfer to a new store. I was very close to my coworkers at my first store but i didnt fit in with the other salon workers at the new location. I was feeling very out of touch with my social circle and extremely stressed out. Then one day, B had a very bad dissociative episode and didn't recognize me. I felt completely useless and pointless, especially since that morning I had also slept through my alarm for work; again. I remeber bursting into tears before getting my best friend, who i now lived with, to comfort B because I all I could think to do run. I then left the house and got into my car fall apart. I noticed Bs nightmare medication and zoloft, and without a second thought downed the entire bottle of prazosin and drove to a park. I then swallowed a handful of zoloft for good measure before i got a call from my best friend. When i got back to the house (god knows how i didnt wreck my car because i was definitely starting to feel the effects) They knew what was up immediately and then I was hospitalized for a second time, only a month after the first visit. Before my first hospital visit, I discovered one of my worst vices: cocaine. While i enjoyed other drugs, not counting weed, I didn't really care to seek them out on my own. But i fell in love with coke. i loved the way it made me feel physically, and finally the persistent exhaustion of being alive lifted and i felt like i could actually focus on something long enough to accomplish it. I was a nasty habit that gave me panic attacks, made me somehow even broker, and by the end of it I had gone from 240lbs to 160lbs since it made not eating even easier. I was also even more tired and irritated constantly. Thankfully my best friend had dealt with an eating disorder in highschool and called me out and helped me start eating better again. And then B and I tried meth. It was amazing, but it was also the fucking worst. We only did it twice, and the first time I personally only had a long, irritating comedown, but B dissociated so hard he thought he was 16 again for 3 days. The next time we did it i started to see things and have panic attacks at the thought of having to go to work in the morning. I called into work and that day we broke up because I wanted to get clean and he didn't. The next day we talked when we were clear headed we got back together, him now ready to quit too. I'm incredibly lucky that we got out when we did from meth because it would have destroyed us. Its something i still fear that I'll relapse into again, even though i dont really miss it except when I'm feeling especially dead inside. I told my mom about my drug use and this prompted a visit to a new psychiatrist who diagnosed me with BPD. It's nice to finally find a diagnosis that seemed to actually fit. I'm doing better right now, relatively. I found a medication that actually works, thank god for trileptal, B and I are mostly sober, the hardest thing we do now is acid every now and then, and we still smoke, just probably too much now. I've started DBT but had to stop because i got a new job and it didn't fit into my schedule, but now im on job number 3 of 2020 and its much more loosely scheduled so i can actually focus on my mental health for once in my life.
Anyways, the question I wanted to ask is I don't understand still why I have BPD. Everyone talks about how childhood trauama can ""cause"" it, and I know depression runs in the family, but not BPD. I come from a stable home where I was loved, although not really accepted but that wasn't until later on after my mental health started tanking. I feel guilty about it, and I can't help but think that I took a start for a good life and just shit all over it. I feel like such a family disappointment and I feel like im going to be stuck on this random, emotional rollercoaster forever and I'll just continue to destroy every good thing in my life. If i could pinpoint it to anything, I would think my roommate in freshman year sneaking out of our room might have been the start of the extreme fear of abandonment, but that seems like such a stupid, not traumatic or abusive at all thing to have caused me to go from who I was before, someone i can barely even remember what they were even like in terms of personality, to the dumpster fire ive become. Maybe theres some repressed memory of something happening to me, because I get asked if I was ever sexually assualted a lot, but I have no memory of anything like that ever happening and while I don't have a problem having sex mentally my body just doesn't seem to react that well to anyone other than myself. Maybe my brain chemistry is just that fucked that sometime as simple as a friend hanging out with someone else sometimes set it off. I just want to get to the root of the issue, any insight or if y'all also just want to spill your entire life story onto the internet feel free and I'll listen to you. Take care guys

80,Help for Borderline Personality Disorder?,I've never used this site so my apologies if I'm doing anything wrong... I am in desperate need of help. A year ago I was diagnosed with BPD. I thought I could handle it on my own and for a few months while I was by myself I could control the disorder. I've been in a relationship for maybe eight months and it's hit the point of no return. There's something about being in a relationship that triggers my deeply embedded issues of abandonment. I need help despite my hatred of talking about my feelings. Has anyone tried using medication to regulate BPD? Has anyone gone through DBT? Is simply speaking to someone the solution? I would greatly appreciate any support or advice.
