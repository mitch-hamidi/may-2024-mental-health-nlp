0,my mum makes me feel bad ab being myself,"i'm a teenage girl with bpd and i'm not really the most happy person; but whenever i act happy or hyper or genuinely be myself (and i know i can be weird) my mum asks me if i'm okay but in a manner where she looks at me like i'm acting insane whenever i'm just genuinely happy and it makes me want to cry. she asks me if i'm drunk or high whenever i'm just being myself, and it makes me feel so shitty about myself, i feel like i have to be monotone around her or really calm; or she'll immediately think i'm on drugs, manic or acting really weird,

for background info i've never had a drug problem, i've been manic a couple times but nothing for the past two years. so i can really understand where her worry comes from in that aspect; 

but it hurts me that it feels like i cant be myself around my own mum without her genuinely acting like i'm insane, weird or immediately thinking im on drugs. i hate myself and i wish i didn't act so weird when i was happy,

none of my friends think this type of stuff; it's just her. 

i don't really like posting stuff online but i'm genuinely so confused about it; and i have nobody who's i know that's been in a similar situation and cant find anything about it online. i'm just really confused and it's upsetting me, does anyone know what i could do or anything that would be the reason to this?",1714337568.0,False,4,12,ccovenss,None,1cfgtq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1cfgtq7/my_mum_makes_me_feel_bad_ab_being_myself/
1,How to cope with loneliness? ,"Male 16 years old, im having problems making connections with people. Everyone i text/call asking if they want to hangout, noone really wants to talk to me or socialise.
I have drug addiction problems, been in rehab, helped me a bit, but i am still using. 
I always feel alone and worthless, its like i dont have a real personality. I try to distract myself from this, with drugs, porn, and work.
From time to time it gets worse, i can wake up and instantly cry for a few hours.
No stable relationships and schools. I really dont know what to do, im always alone but sometimes it just hits different. Realizing that im so lonely is a big trigger for me.

4,Struggling with being lied to,"(TW) . 


When my husband and I met. I expressed that due to my being a recovering addict. That a big part of my step by step process to recovery is to not be with anyone who uses. It’s just a major trigger for me (not just because of my sobriety but because of a very abusive relationship I was in). So dating someone who is recovering as well is just something I mentally am not ready for. My now husband was involved in a lifestyle that had led me to believe he may be using drugs. I asked him about it to which he swore up and down he’d never have done. That from his childhood. He just grew to an understanding drugs are life destroying  and he’d never touch them. (His parents were addicts) I  told him good because I can’t enter a relationship with you if you’re newly sober, using etc. I’m not stable enough on my own sobriety journey to do so. (I explained more in depth but it’s a very touchy and trigger subject for me to talk about) Well. Fast forward. We’re now newly weds and he comes to me with a confession. That he lied to me and was in fact only 2 weeks sober when we met. He told me he didn’t tell me because he didn’t want to lose me. But at the time of the conversation we had only just met, we hadn’t even began dating yet. There have been multiple situations in our relationship where I felt like he may be doing drugs. But because he said he’s never touched them. I ignored my gut feelings and moved past them. This feels catastrophic to me. Like it’s the end of the relationship. There are other factors as well. But being lied to is always been my biggest problem when it comes to people. Once I’ve been lied to. I cut ties. But it isn’t that simple as we’ve just gotten married.. I feel very trapped and hurt. It feels like he’s intentionally waited until we got married to drop this on me. Especially bc he’s become so open about it all as if he’s been that way the whole relationship. I’m constantly having to tell him I’m not comfortable with the conversation as it is very triggering. But he just doesn’t seem to get it. Ultimately I feel like my choice was taken from me. If I had known I would’ve gladly remained in his life as his friend. But I wouldn’t have dated him. Let alone married him.  Which makes me feel like a horrible person for saying. But I expressed that to him when we met and he chose to withhold the fact he’s recovering from me as a response. He said he didn’t know how to tell me after I said I wouldn’t date him and that he didn’t want to lose me either and just be friends. I feel like I don’t know him anymore. Especially with everything else that has happened leading up to this ",1700673252.0,False,4,1,Witchy_hippie5,None,181e9u2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/181e9u2/struggling_with_being_lied_to/
5,Having issues with forgiving myself,"I female (21) have bpd and i have a really hard time forgiving myself when i do shit when im manic, i dont really know how to start this so im just going to start with saying i have been dating my current bf male (31) I first meant him when I was with my ex bf (21) we will call him M. Me and m were friends since we were 7 years old. He was my best friend my everything. We got together when we were 18,19 things fell off after covid and I didn't know how to actually break it off bc I had an Attachment to him, he was my favorite person for a while. So more content me and him both dealt with abuse in different way but we were there for each other almost everyday when we were in grade school. About a year and a half ago I fell off and started doing drugs bc I started realize maybe m wasn't the best person for me and that really hurt bc he was everything why wasn't this relationship everything to me anymore. I got distance, started hanging with the wrong crowd of ppl and I really hurt him. I Snorted drugs in front of him and would tell him to fuck off or to just leave if he didn't like it. It got to the point where I was just verbally abusive to him, I hated myself doing that to him. I then broke up with him but still would have sex with him bc I needed to get off, I knew he loved me still and wanted us to work but I didn't care, I only cared about myself. then about a year ago I started messing around with my current bf, we made it official, but when my current bf left out of town, I texted m and fucked him while my current bf was gone. My current bf still doesn't know this happened but I told m everything he was hurt and blocked me on everything. I can't blame him I hurt him so bad probably worse then anyone has ever hurt him before. I then didn't text him for about a year but we have a Mutual friend that I just saw this Thanksgiving and he brought up the fact that me and m were so amazing as friends, it made me remember how much I missed him, I texted his sister to tell her how sorry I was and that I wasn't in my right mind from the drugs and now that I'm clean I would like to try to be friends or at least Acquaintances. Long story short that's prob never going to happen. Which Is totally okay I completely understand but I can't stop thinking about all the horrible things I did, the years I lost with someone all bc I couldn't just tell him I couldn't be with him anymore. There is a lot more to the story but this is already long as fuck. If anyone has any suggestions to help me not hate myself as much that would help, I have gone to lots of therapy for this and I know I'm the asshole, I know I don't deserve his friendship again im just really beating myself up and I'm scared it might lead me hurting myself or others again.",1701208678.0,False,3,0,lilknikie3002,None,18681fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/18681fd/having_issues_with_forgiving_myself/
6,Bpd - advice / help,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this but just looking for some advice, I’m diagnosed with bpd. I’ve always known I am impulsive and self disruptive, but I’ve only just kind of noticed after thinking something like how bad it is, and I’m just wondering is this part of bpd and do other people experience this and how can it be changed. So for example today, I didn’t sleep all night was doing cocaine till about 1pm today about 5pm I said to myself and meant it genuinely, felt like I really was serious for once, said I’ve had enough of doing this, and it’s selfish and I’m bored of it and had enough of repeating this cycle & that I’m not going down this route, because I know what’s happened in the past when I’ve abused drugs to much. I even said to my friends that I do drugs with, I was going to distance myself from them & obviously I have said this to myself before, but I like felt really serious this time. Bearing in mind I still haven’t slept, without even realising to myself what I said earlier I go and get more on tick when I’m skint and have an early morning hospital appointment, so deep down I know it’s a bad idea but just don’t even think about the consequences, even though my normal self is the biggest stress head and overthinker, but for some reason when I do these self disruptive things, I somehow just don’t care almost and just think will be fine. And I went ahead got drugs, eventually started to feel the regret flowing in, then quickly realised the conversation I had earlier, and literally felt baffled, because I didn’t know I was so kind of out of control with my own head, that I can go from being stressed and feeling terrible n hating myself n think I’m really fed up and done with this, to literally just reckless. I’m just wondering is this normal with bpd and i’ve just never really noticed it before and if so, is there anyway to control yourself when you go into the self disrupt careless mindset, like how do you get your normal self back that thinks logically, because I can see this is like one massive problem in my life, and in the past that mindset got me to a point I was an alcoholic, doing cocaine whenever I got the chance and on a rehab list and eventually jumped off a bridge, because of hating myself so much n rhen doing it over again, then feeling terrible later on. I never really realised how much of a problem this is until now . I also know this could be part of addiction, but i’ve also done things like self harm, and drank bleach when not thinking straight.",1696393572.0,False,2,2,whatevertfu,None,16zdm4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/16zdm4k/bpd_advice_help/
7,whats wrong w me !!!,"uaggh i dont have the means to get diagnosed with bpd but my relationships with people are so fucked it makes me hate myself. Ive done this with 5 people before, and this time is no different. we start talking and we have so much in common and i am so happy talking to him and he calls me lil nicknames and everything. The other day he mentioned doing drugs and I think i was just really worried and nervous for his wellbeing but i got really pissed off at him cause i thought he would be a different person and treat me differently. I was so mad at him yesterday and i dont think he knew at all so today after intentionally being as dry as possible, i told him how i felt and he was really fucking nice but he shouldnt be. Im being dragged in again and everything thought is being consumed by him. I love him and i dont want him to leave but every text message i see from him is filled with immense dread. I am ashamed!! Ive relapsed and i cannot let myself go through this again. This is my 4th or 5th time through this cycle and i need to break it but the fear of not knowing why im like this makes it so hard.

8,BPD and meds (Quetiapine),"Hi, recently I got diagnosed with bpd.
I’ve been struggling for a long time, and there were suspicions for BPD but now it is confirmed. To be honest it’s not that much of a surprise, I somehow knew I had it but was still hoping it’s not true.
My symptoms became more severe ever since I got into a relationship, including agressive outbursts, jealousy and a constant feeling of uneasiness. Blaming my partner constantly and feeling left out started to kill my relationship, and I didn’t want it to happen at all. Luckily my partner is patient and we somehow stayed together. I went to a psychiatrist, got diagnosed and now I am on Brintellixn(vortioxetine) and Quetiapine.
Already after a few days I can feel my moods are more stable, but quetiapine does make me sleepy and very hard to wake up in the morning. At this moment I am only taking 25 mg of quetiapine at night but I am supposed to up the dose to 50mg a day (25 in the morning, 25 at night).
As I have never experienced this drug I have my reservations and I am a bit scared of it’s sideffects (losing all emotion, drowsiness, weight gain, unable to concetrate)

9,BPD friend ghosting ,"My friend has BPD. He has drug addiction because of CPTSD from narcisstic abuse from both parents. He has been in rehab which is exactly like a prison for the past 18 months. This is his 4th time and longest rehab. Whenever he is released from rehab he always withdraws from all of us. However during the rehab time he will say he can't wait to come and spend time with us. 

From a BPD mind, why does he behave as us? It has been a few days since he got out and he's been uncontactable as usual.

11,I can't stand feeling like this mate🤢🤮😩😫 (BPD feelings),"Anyone else get nauseous from time to time?? I can't explain whats caused it but I feel so fucking bored I want to scream and rip my hair out, I've done nothing but eat today i feel like I've got a burning hole in my stomach or like a rat is gnawing on my insides eating eases it but for a few seconds then I go back to feeling nauseous, empty and that hole in the stomach thing happens again, it's the type of boredom/dysphoria where I don't want to do anything no ""hobbies"" or interests will soothe it.

I hate everything and everyone apart from my boyfriend I've been on Tumblr and my FP didn't post the post I sent her so she obviously hates me or she hates my other blog and I feel like it's making me split with her, I feel so shit that I've got no friends and nobody who cares about me in my life that I feel like these feelings/realisations are all causing me to feel like I'm stewing in stomach acids, boredom and resentment. I disassocated earlier cos my bf said he hated his new job and I went to sleep. I wish people would understand the emptiness and boredom with BPD isn't some existential thing its an actual torture it's feeling uncomfortable in your own skin, it's feeling like you need to deal with this sickening emptiness and it can only be briefly slated by porn, food, shoplifting, drink or drugs, its like a sickness and I despise it people say get a hobby keep busy etc all I've done is tidy and clean my caravan today, wash clothes, change the bedding etc the sick feeling has still fucking been there.

14,Is it necessary to take medication on every episode?,"Hey, I was diagnosed around 1 year ago and there are a lot of things that my family does in my crisis moments that just feels like it's making things worse.
Like if idk something has triggered me so bad that I start crying or hyperventilating and my mum will force me to take strong medication to fall asleep for hours, but the way that she doesn't even help me, try to calm me or talk to me and just forces me to drug myself and threaten to send me to a hospital if i deny the medication just really makes me even more anxious.
I don't know if it's necessary to get to that point so soon instead of waiting and talking to me.
I really try to explain it to my mother so she can help me and we can understand it better but it just confuses me so much because I don't know any other bpd my age or even in my town and I really need some help understanding all of this, there are still a lot of things that I don't understand about myself or my condition but this is my main concern right now.
Do all BPD anxious episodes need to be managed through medication? Because it really gets me more anxious ...

16,Just got diagnosed.,"Hey guys. (Sorry for confusion I’m new here:))
I (24F) am in DBT outpatient treatment. Just finished 3 weeks of the PHP program. And now on IOP. Which is just 3 days a week for 3 hours a day. The PHP program was 9am-3pm Monday through Friday which I felt like I had a purpose and I was doing something. 
Anyways I guess what I need to let you all know is I was diagnosed with GAD and MDD when I was 16-17 after that went down a slippery slope of drugs (literally all of them) until I did acid at 20... and  thought I lost my freaking MIND lol (funny because having bpd you feel that way anyways) 
I always knew I was “off” or something. 
Fast forward 2 and a half years I was sober and fine.. so I thought. 
Here came the panic attacks, depression. Angry outbursts, quitting jobs, threatening to hurt myself. 
I knew I needed help or I was gonna go right back down the same bad road.
I found an (ACT) therapist that I’ve been seeing every Monday give or take for almost 2 years.. I think . I’ve also held down a job for a little over a year. At this job I had a breakdown that sent me to the doctors and that’s how I made it to the treatment center. I said all this to say now I’ve been diagnosed with BPD. .. idk what to do with that. 
Idk who that is but that’s not me. 
I have a loving boyfriend that doesn’t deserve to deal with all these emotions.

Finding the words for my emotions is so difficult, because i feel things so strongly but then they dont feel important enough to talk about. I want to say all the things i think but i feel like i would only sound stupid and id be misunderstood either way. Im living in a constant state of confusion, i dont know who i am and i have no desire for life or relationships. But i still pretend i do, i initiate love interest out of boredom but i know im not capable of loving anyone-because my self hatred runs so deep.  i know im not taking people seriously and i forget that im intentionally playing with other’s emotions, and for literally no reason- i dont know what to do with myself and i cant stop. Im lonely, i dont have close friends and i hate socializing, but i go on and on about wanting to be loved, wanting someone to talk to- but i dread leaving my home, i have comfort in solitude. Because when im in public all i can think about is how people perceive me, i feel like they think so negatively about me and that im hated or disliked by people who dont even know me, im so insecure it consumes me everyday. Even when talking to people all i can think about is how stupid i sound, how ugly i might look to them. And the stupid thing is, people are nice to me, ive never been bullied. Im the one who judges others, i dont even want to talk to anyone because although im insecure i feel smarter than everyone else, i dont think anyone could get on my level. My mind is always convincing me im terrible in every way, so why do i feel superior at the same time? I dont know. Everyday i think differently about myself, i seriously wear a different face everyday, and having body dysmorphia doesnt help. 
I hate humans so much, im angry all the time, angry at the world and never satisfied with anything. Im a hypocrite, i look down on people who remind me of me. I do the things i hate other people do. I feel so much more woke than most, i see the world for what it really is, and all that does is make me more miserable and self aware to the point i cant take being alone with my own thoughts. I take drugs just to feel something and feel immensely more depressed. But i convince myself its a better feeling than being numb. 
I feel like a faker in everything i do, i feel like my kindness is fake, i know im not all bad, theres good, people around me know i can be good, Why does my mind make me feel so evil, awful and unworthy of anything good. Why does nothing help, I’ve accepted that this is how ill always be, but i dont want to be me anymore i hate it so much, it hurts that i cant change myself.

21,Leaving a toxic FP?,"My FP (23M) and I (23F) have been in a relationship for 3 years now, although we broke up for about 5 months last year (got back together this March). He’s not BPD nor does he have any other illnesses that he or I is aware of, but we’re both extremely toxic for each other. It’s been a really rough 5 months of trying to mend things (him cheating and lying for months, my microcheating, etc etc) and I haven’t healed at all. How he cheated on me really impacted my self esteem, self worth, trust, and overall how I view him. I don’t think at this point it’ll get any easier since it hasn’t these last 5 months. I don’t feel close with him anymore or like we have a connection. I don’t even feel attracted to him anymore, but he somehow is still my FP. I know I need to leave, but I have no idea how. I’m so scared I’ll run back like I always do because of my fear of abandonment, but I know I don’t want to. He’s my comfort despite everything, but I know I need to do this.

22,do you guys have hobbies?,"i just had a week off of school (well, uni) and i straight up did nothing. Like i rewatched some safiya nygaard videos, played sims an afternoon and i guess i went grocery shopping and cooked dinner a couple times but other than that? 

i'm really in my 20s with zero hobbies. i quit drinking (heavily) and doing drugs etc because i lost control over myself, but now i'm realizing i have nothing left. between the ages of 15-20 all i really thought about was when i could get drunk again.

it's just kind of sad. i like the idea of being creative - writing songs, painting, drawing, making jewelry etc, but whenever i try to do something like that, i get frustrated because nothing ever turns out how i want it to, and i don't ever give myself space or time to learn, and then i go back to what i know (which is rewatching youtube vids while playing some dumb game on my phone).

24,Everything is so Faint,"Lately, like for the past 3 months, my emotions have been very faint to me. Other than humor and boredom, everything else isn't as strong as it used to be. Like usually when something happens that usually triggers my bpd, I'd feel it strongly in my palms or chest, but now it's like i dont feel the emotion but i still have the thought process (Which I've been learned to ignore and process what happens to me in different ways.)   
For example, recently I've been having the thought process of like feeling unloved and bad, but i dont feel that emotion in my chest or palms, and more so is just thinking about it. My boyfriend was basically confessed too on valentines day (Something we've never really done) and instead of letting them know they have girlfriend, he says to me ""Im gonna play dumb""  
This triggered bpd induced dreams, where i literally dream hes cheating on me, its like haunting me. When I vented to them about it, it wasn't even coherent and they didnt really comfort me.   
I lost my mind in my head but I didn't feel anything at the time. I also went to a mitski concert recently, and realized that I can ONLY process my emotions if im listening to music (which is a semi recent thing), but I texted my boyfriend something heartfelt and they didn't even reply. They just said ""I"" and moved on. I know i should communicate some of these things but i fear its not even worth it, I just have to move on too.  
That on top of dealing with racists at my job, college anxiety and general world problems, I feel myself like becoming numb. I had like a coping mechanism which wasnt THAT healthy but it worked (it wasnt drugs) but nowadays im finding it boring, im finding games boring, and all I find myself wanting to do is eat and sleep. I think me feeling numb stems from my childhood to now honestly. I've never in my entire life experienced any kind of healthy relationship, whether friends or family, or romantic. My moms relationships in the past were horrible, and her trust issues grew onto me. My family is so broken its beyond even trying to repair, I mostly just wanna stay in touch with my sister and my mom. As a kid whenever bad shit would happen to me or in general I would force myself to not feel anything, like numb my emotions (it was proly based off something I saw online but it was always my go to) and I was always using escapism, like maladaptive daydreaming or hyperfixiating on books (the hyperfixiating was literally unhealthy too I would just not move)   
So now in present time, having to continue dealing with bullshit in different fonts, I kind of reverted back to some of my old habits unconciously. Like I can't daydream that much anymore, but I defintely numbed my emotions, cause everything just feels so faint. Granted it could be depression, but i usually feel that intense sadness or pain, which I don't really feel. It's definetly there but its not physically hurting me, I'm just thinking about it. Nowadays I've truly only found comfort in my sister, since we've been hanging out alot more and theyve been opening up to me more. But I can't hangout with my sister all the time, nor do i want to be reliant on her since im the older sister, and i want to be the one to help her instead. I just really wish things we're more clear and I wasn't so delusional.",1708248095.0,False,5,4,Yeetmyass420,None,1atq5gd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1atq5gd/everything_is_so_faint/
25,Should I stay in my messy relationship?,"I've been diagnosed with BPD since I was 17 (I'm 24 now) and I've done a lot of different therapies for it. I thought I was getting better for the longest time because I thought I had my emotions and everything under control, especially in relationships. I've been seeing my boyfriend for roughly 2 years and I've noticed I've completely went off the rails. Any sense of emotional stability I've had before has completed disappeared. 2 years ago I was holding down a stable and really good paying job for 3 years and I think they liked me considering they trained me in every department and would always complement my work. I also had lots of friends and was very social, I even had friends that I was friends with for 9 years (there would be a few years in between where we wouldn't talk because of them moving or just different life pathways but always found our way back to each other). I also was in university and bought a car from the dealership and my credit score was really amazing too. I really felt like my life has direction at that point. That was until my dad got his second DUI and went into rehab and came out of rehab doing meth and completely flipping out. That's when I met my boyfriend. It was such a a rough time for me, I had to talk to the cops a lot and get a restraining order against my dad for awhile. My boyfriend was unlike anyone else I dated, he didn't try and force me to have sex and I waited awhile before hooking up with him, and even before we had hooked up he was there to support me through everything! I was so appreciative and really fell in love because I thought he was so compassionate. He had recently went through a break up so I had a sneaking suspicion I was a rebound and I just wanted to know where he and him stood. He promised me I wasn't a rebound and he hadn't talked to his ex for a few months. My BPD started flairing up and I went through his phone (I'm sorry I know it's bad but I developed this bad habit from my last ex being with him for a whole year and trusting him but seeing millions of girls messaging him till I finally had a hunch and checked and was mortified, I just didn't want to waste my time again) I found text messages between his friend and him saying that if he hooked up with me he'd basically be tunnel brothers with all his buddies (which is far from true, he thought I hooked up with both his friends but I only hooked up with his one other friend once when I was blackout at a party and I didn't even really want it to happen) it hurt my feelings to feel like he was talking about me like that to his friends and kinda made me feel like a whore. I ended up flipping and waking him up with a garbage bag full of his stuff and sent him home. We ended up talking it out and we started hanging again. But then whenever he got drunk, he'd call me his ex's name, and he called her and said he loved her and missed her. I was devastated once again, but now I felt like an easy rebound whore. So we once again fought and he convinced me it wasn't that way, just to go and hook up with her the one night I asked for space (he is extremely codependent). I was pissed and tried to convince myself I was done with him. But I'm stupid so I forgave him, I think I only did that because of all the trauma I was going through with my dad, I really wanted someone to be there for me and hold me and tell me everything was okay. He was back at my place again for awhile and then he disappeared to his ex's place for a whole week and swore on his life he didn't hook up with her and was just there to support her through a rough time (he only recently told me they did actually hook up). I spent the whole week crying at work and just being miserable. He begged me to stay with him and I did, which is something I've never done before. I've never ever ever let someone disrespect me like this before, but I felt so low and vulnerable. We were together for awhile after all that and it was so hard for me to not want to abandon him at any fight we had. We fought a lot and were pretty miserable together. I was really trying to break things off but he kept claiming he really wanted to be with me. He hooked up with a new girl he met and was hanging with secretly behind my back at his friends place for a month or two. What made me really mad is I would let him drive my car over there while I was at work and I bought an Xbox for him to use at my place and he was playing games with her while I was at work. Anyways he hooks up with her and she has BPD too. So off the hop she started tracking his location and everything, so he came clean to me about it and told me she was crazy and regrets doing it. I told him that he should just be with her and just leave me alone. She ended up needing help and he convinced me to go pick her up and help her get drugs. She ends up getting me and him into doing those drugs (we've done it before and were completely sober, just have a hard time saying no when it's right in front of me). We all ended up going on a 7 day bender and by the end of it I was all alone and the most mentally fucked I've ever been. They ended up dating. For a whole month he kept pressuring me to come over and give me drugs to drive them around and he even pressured me into a threesome. I only did it because I'm stupid and just did kinda want to be high and see him. They were absolutely vile to me while I was there and I finally got the back bone to block them and sober up. She would make millions of tiktoks about how she fucked him in the bed beside me to put me in my place and how she wants to beat me up now that I didn't want to be their bitch. She even threatened to send a whole gang of people to my house if I didn't send her money at one point. I was nothing but nice to her, swear on my life! She wanted to put me in my place because I warned her that he can be cheaty and to watch out! And she claimed I was trying to break them up. She still to this day posts about me and it's been a year since him and her were last together. Anyways, I was dating someone and doing shitty but alright. Sober, university drop out, bluey watching, chain smoking, loser on medical leave from work. My ex got me up and I dropped everything to meet up with him and to hear how shit his life was without me (hopefully) and it was. He GOT HER PREGNANT!!! And was absolutely MISERABLE! I was rolling. I wanted to laugh in his face and go back to eating cupcakes and watching bluey buuuutttt I self sabotaged my life and decided I wanted revenge on the girl for being a dick to me so I broke up with my boyfriend ( I held him back anyways, he deserves way better then a dumpster fire like me) and I hooked up with him while she was pregnant and behind her back and threw it in her face and then laughed at the tiktoks of her balling her eyes. I know I'm horrible, I really wasn't thinking right, I was kinda off the rails and sick of feeling like everyone gets to shit on me and have no repercussions, if I could go back in time I would have never met up with him. I didn't want to get back together but I ended up hooking up with him long enough that we did (the sex is the best I've ever had for some reason and he really makes me feel safe because of being there for the stuff with my dad). Getting back together with him made all my friends drop me, they were already mad at me for being too depressed and reclused for awhile.I was an ass to him though, constantly mad about him even being with a girl that was so cruel to other girls like that (even though I kinda was cruel to her by taking him back for revenge for all the shit she did to me). We were once again miserable together but I had quite my other job and now we were miserable and broke. my mom got us a job together and we started to work and save up for an apartment (I'm good at saving, he blew my money and his). I ended up having to borrow the money from my grandma for first and last ($3000, which I still have to pay her back for) I was also the only one allowed on the lease because of my good credit score and before we moved in, while I was working over time, he was looking at the girls onlyfans. Turns out he used his first paycheck to subscribe and look at her shit. It was a big blow up fight and he told me he only wanted to see if she was posting their videos they made together. We already had the apartment lined up so I forgave him and told him to just be honest with me and to never do it again. By that point I was so angry and resentful towards him, I was miserable everyday. He refused to cuddle with me or be affectionate with me at all or even have sex with me. I started becoming an angry violent alcoholic and we started to go at each other. I fucked his teeth up and he left me all bruised up. Our apartment was disgusting, he never helped me clean or cook or do laundry, he just played videogames and ignored me. He also brought his dog that he got with him and that girl together to our apartment and it wasn't house trained so it peed on everything. The dog peed on the couch I bought so much that I had to pay to throw it out. It peed on my Tv remote, laptop, bed and pillows, like literally everything. I dislike dogs because my parents would get aggressive rescues when I was a child that would attack me and I grew up to find them loud, obnoxious, and gross. I was the only one cleaning up after his dog. I found him on onlyfans again buying a bunch of girls content when he couldn't pay his phone bill that was in my name since he had no credit to get a new phone ( I got him a brand new phone and a phone plan), and he was even short on rent most of the time. He literally would beg them to meet up and everything. I was officially numb and done. I tried for a whole week to break up with him sobbing and begging for me not too, he begged me to give him one more month and I agreed. But then his dad died. I was such a a cunt to him though when his dad was dying because of the onlyfans stuff and I dislike dogs and his mom has 13 dogs and her house is covered in piss, shit, dirt, and dog hair. The dogs literally pee on everything. So I tried to support him from a distance, even though I drove him to the hospital and made sure to buy his dad blanket and slippers and soup when he couldn't eat the hospital food. But when it came time for us to wait out his death at his mom's place, I really didn't want to be there for him. I wanted to be able to come during the day but then spend the night at my parents place which was 10 minutes away. But he made me stay and we fought a lot. After his dad past, since we took so much time to take care of him we ended up losing our jobs. I instantly applied for welfare to make sure we could still pay rent, he on the other hand didn't. So I had to borrow money from my mom to pay his half of the rent. I also had to start going to the food bank and he refused to come with me even though I was anxious. I had to make him apply for welfare to help me because he refused to let me have my friends move in for us to be able to pay rent. Eventually I had enough and broke up with him and instantly hopped into a new relationship. I spent the whole month away from him anxious and feeling like shit, he was absolutely miserable and missed me and called me crying everyday. I ended up finding out I was pregnant with his kid (break up sex 🙄) and so I got back together with him and ended up  misscarry on Valentine's day, which was not my worst Valentines day lmao. But since getting back together he's made major improvements and swears on his life he wants to spend the rest of his life with me and I hates himself everyday for what he did to me. He has made major improvements but now I'm so broken and fucked up, I've become just like him when he was treating me like garbage. We had to move into his mom's place since my dad started doing meth again and I have another restraining order against my dad. I just feel triggered constantly at his mom's place. So should I even bother staying with him at this point? He has changed a lot, but now I'm extremely toxic and miserable.

26,"I'm in a deep hole, and it's not my fault.","My mom didn't pay any of the rent in a flat the city arranged for us. Since she's still raising 2 kids and work only 3/4 times, the court deemed her unable to pay up, so now I will have to pick up the bill.

But I don't want to, I Fucking don't want to and don't have to.

She broke me mentally and socially.
 I've been babysitting her kids since I turned 7, every day, I wasn't allowed to go out on my own more than twice per month.

She never cared for me, never went to parents-teachers meetings, never thought of helping me with homework.

Whenever I went to her and asked for help because I was getting bullied she brushed it off with ""then change yourself if you don't fit in"" 

She never did anything when my deadbeat father was beating me, with belts, spoons, cables, broom handles, kicks, punches. Not a word I heard. I don't actually remember if she hugged me.

I couldn't ask her to appoint a doctor for me. Whenever I was sick she'd wait until I get better or I couldn't get out of the bed. 

She never cared for my dental health, never bought me a toothbrush, toothpaste or a floss.

When I had a rotten tooth she waited for 3 weeks to appoint me with a dentist, and only after the pain was so intense I had severe delirium and tried to kill myself, but it was too late and I had to undergo an emergency tooth extraction, and even then she was hesitant to pay $20 for an anesthesia shot. 

She'd never buy me new clothes, only after my old ones were to small she would go to a thrift store and buy me some 2nd hand old clothes. 

When I said in school that I don't think I'm good up the dome (a saying in my country), they appointed me to a psychiatrist, she was hesitant, missed the first term, after I got another term she went with me once. After the meeting doctor said that I show symptoms of ADHD, depression and possible BPD. After that she told me to ""act normal and shut up about our problems in school"" because she won't be going to the shrink with me. 

I never asked for things like a PC, smartphone, a bike or a fucking allowance.

I could go on and on about how she fucked me up, but when I turned a legal age I went to work, every day after the school I was working 5 to 12 at local McDonald's to bring some money and support the family. And I did support her, gave her enough to cover the rent, paid the electricity bills, bought her new furniture, new fridge, new shower cabin, whenever one of my siblings needed something I was the first to whip out my wallet. 

And now I was sentenced to pay a Fucking debt of almost $10000 because this Fucking bitch never cared for anything but booze and drugs! 

I don't have that kind of money, I don't know where to find it, I don't know what to do. I thought I was finally free of her when I moved out, but no. She had to do me dirty one last time. 

I Fucking hate her. 

It is a vent but I hope someone might help me and tell me what to do. 

This whole thing has turned me into an aggressive asshole, I've pushed everyone away and whenever someone says something on the street to me I just yell ""fuck off"" or go straight to a brawl.

I'm not advocating for using any type of drugs or alcohol.  I know all the reasons we aren't supposed to do it.  

I don't use it to control my emotions, though.  I use to to manage my *thoughts*.  I feel like there are many little versions of me in my head at any given time.  I know this is fairly normal.  But they're all chattering, chattering, chattering all at once.  And they like to throw things at me like reminding me of the existence of people and things I'd rather forget.

This is an analogy, by the way, I'm not completely whacko.  I know all those ""voices"" are me.  I just feel so helpless to them sometimes.

And when I smoke weed, most of them quiet down.  Especially the ones that fly in and tell me things like ""your ex was right to treat you like shit"" and ""no one really loves you and no one ever will.""  They shut up.  All that's left is the louder ""voices"" that I actually feel in control of.

28,I am on the verge of giving up on life and i need help.,"I (24 female) have been diagnosed with bpd 2 years ago. I’ve gone through lots of therapy and lots of medications but it feels like no matter how hard i try i always go back to my older self the minute i am triggered. I feel stressed and tired of life and i feel so alone. I work a full time job while attending university (studying engineering) at the same time and its been so hard on me. I am all alone in life which means i had to work and figure things on my own since i was 16 years old and i am so exhausted. I am trying to do better and be a better person, friend and partner but its like i am the most despicable person to them so i don’t blame anyone for abandoning me but it’s so hard one me cuz i am trying and i don’t want to be that person but i cant. 

It feels like I’ve hit rock bottom and my life is a mess. I am on academic probation due to my declining gpa and grades even though i am trying my best i am attending every class doing everything on time studying well before every exam but i seem to be doing something wrong cuz my grades don’t reflect that. My job isn’t going that well it’s so stressful and triggering and i am overworking myself cuz I can’t lose it or i will be homeless with my university tuition, rent, bills etc…., My house is a total mess its disgusting  i am so embarrassed to show it to anyone its the worse it has ever got though i live in a tiny space. 

My relationship with my partner isn’t going that well and i am mainly the reason why. He supported me more than anyone in my life and been there for me through everything but when it comes to mental illnesses he doesn’t really understand what i am going through and keeps trying to encourage me in the wrong way with things that work for normal people or for him not for someone who is suffering from crippling anxiety and depression as well as bpd. Though he is trying to change his views.

And i need help cuz i can’t do this anymore and i want to give up i see no hope for future the harder i try the worse it gets and though i love my partner more than life and is the i only person in my life, he is better off without me i hurt him so much that I can’t even forgive myself anymore though he worked through it all with me. I cant do this life anymore i have nothing to look forward to and honestly don’t want anything. 

Also, I struggled with self harm, alcoholism, and drug abuse but i worked through all that but these days the only thing on my mind is to just get black out drunk though I’ve been sober for a year. And its so hard to battle my urges. 

If you have any advices or experiences please share with me cuz it feels like i get a virtual hug when i talk to people who understand things and going through the same things i am going through.",1699861215.0,False,4,1,Informal-Loan3063,None,17u5m67,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/17u5m67/i_am_on_the_verge_of_giving_up_on_life_and_i_need/
29,Advice on how to manage symptoms without professional help?,"This post might be a bit long so sorry in advance. tldr; I have no access to MH services and need advice on managing my symptoms. 

For a bit of background, I've had issues with anger and lashing out as long as I can remember. My other symptoms started to display between the ages of 13 and 16 and have progressively got worse as I've gotten older. I live in the UK and was with CAMHS while in college, my CAMHS worker said that she was pretty much certain I have BPD, but because I was 17 she couldn't officially diagnose me due to guidelines (something about puberty and hormones causing the symptoms, idk). My sessions were first thing on a Friday morning but as I progressed in college I needed to spend all my time on campus and couldn't go to my appointments anymore, and was discharged.

Since then I've not been to any sort of therapy, I went back to my GP at 18 and they put me on anti depressants which did absolutely nothing but made me feel worse and I stopped. I'm now nearing 21 and have been referred to my local mental health services maybe 4 or 5 times since, but nothing has ever come of it, they've just told me to self refer to drug groups/anger management groups despite the fact that I've said multiple times that my drug and anger issues are due to a larger problem, not the sole problem theirselves. I'll admit that I'd sort of given up with it due to being fucked around so many times, but recently my boyfriend got super worried after a breakdown which resulted in me not leaving my room for 6 days, bearly eating, crying near constantly and lashing out when he came to check on me because I took him not spending all 6 days with me as him not caring about me. After I'd regained my senses, I agreed to give getting help another go, and sent in an online form to the local services describing all my symptoms, explained that I've been told by CAMHS I've probably got BPD but couldn't be diagnosed at the time, and wanted help for that. 

Well this was at the beginning of March, and obviously with everything going on now, I doubt I'm going to get any help until this has all blown over.
I can feel myself slipping back into old habits, getting stupidly impulsive, saying nasty things without thinking, my moods won't stay consistent for more than an hour at a time and I'm getting increasingly paranoid that my boyfriend, housemates, family, basically everyone hates me and wants me dead. I really don't know how to handle this anymore, part of me knows I'm being ridiculous but it feels like the sane part of me is locked in a room watching the mental part of me take control and ruin every aspect of my life.

30,i'm new here and would like to be of some support :),"Hi I was told this sub is a bit better than the other and not full of self-diagnosis's (spelling?). I'm just here to give everyone some positivity and be of support if people need it.
I was diagnosed 3 years ago at 22 but probably suffered since 15, I really struggled with the UK mental health service and my parents took me into private health care due to the severity of one of my suicide attempts and feeling at a loss when it came to support. 
It's now been 2 years since going through therapy and I'm approaching my 25th birthday, I honestly didn't think I'd make it here, I was set on destroying myself. I haven't self harmed or attempted suicide since, in my darkest days I was hospitalised at least once a week. I still struggle with my emotions but it's no way near on the scale that I used to struggle. I've cut down on my alcohol intake and drugs are a thing of the past. I've been in a full time job and found out what I want to do. I still don't have many friends, still finding it hard to form relationships, and I still feel like my boyfriend will leave me for whatever reasons I can conjur up. But it's getting better. I'm not here to brag or get 'karma' I've been thinking about my BPD more recently and wanted to see if I could help others.

31,i feel trapped ,"‼‼PLEASE READ‼‼I have BPD and the person i'm in a situationship with also has BPD and we are sort of heading into a relationship with exclusivity but we haven't labelled it yet, but we argue frequently over small stuff and it's so mentally draining. Anyways what i wanted to say is, my ex was/is abusive and she was able to hide it so so well (even to this day i'm still not convinced she abused me but most of my closest friends in my life have been trying to drill it into my head), i'm just seeing a bit of a pattern with my current 'partner' and i feel trapped. I'm 18 and a lesbian so there's a lot of stuff that makes me feel giddy inside like how we have a shared playlist on spotify etc. I understand BPD but i don't think that can excuse their behaviour towards me, i keep saying that since i don't react that way then why do they react that way but of course we are all individual with our own opinions and feelings, i just feel like me having BPD also gets pushed under the rug and when their friends (who are also my friends now) come to me about something that happened with them and how i need to communicate and stuff, they are always a lot harsher to me but seem to step on egg shells around them. They have broken the one boundary i set (i have no boundaries or standards due to being a very passive and forgiving person) which was to not kiss my friends (lesbian circle is insane) and they did just that last month... 3 times (same person), the first time was okay ish since i didn't specifically set that boundary but the second time they split on me and did it in front of me (this was when i set the boundary clearly) and then the third time they did it and their excuse was to get back at me because they thought i was also kissing other people but i wasn't and the person they kissed was on pingers (supposed love drug) i'm still slowly forgiving them for it. Whenever we do argue, i always end up apologising for reacting (even when i rightfully reacted how a normal person would) and they only seem to apologise when it makes them look like a good person. I'm just worried about looking like the bad guy when i am friends with their friends and i have gotten closer to them and vice versa. Im scared if i end things i will lose the friendships i got from being with his person. I also don't think i can leave since i am so emotionally attached it really freaks me out. Also when we argue, it's never been me starting (except for the time they kissed my friend), it's always been them getting defensive and then it ends up becoming an argument. Ah i don't know i really like this person but it feels embarrassing that i would be getting into my next relationship with a potential abuser/narcissist AGAIN. Now i'm stressing that maybe i'm the problem. I think i have been able to tame my BPD but i don't think my 'partner' has and it is just so draining, because they are SO nice and sweet in person, it's just over text and it really freaks me out. For example (i could keep talking about this) today/yesterday they left me on opened on instagram, which isn't objectively a big deal but because of my BPD i get scared that if they don't like my message or respond then that means they are mad at me, so i said to them in a jokey way ""MATE STOP AIRING ME ON HERE ARGH LIKE THE MESSAGE OR SMTH PLZ 😭"" they respond ""BRUH I DIDNT NOTICE"" I respond ""🤓 you've done it so many times STOP IT"" they respond ""what the fuck it literally doesn't matter"" in response i did leave them on read/open. They also continue to dismiss my feelings on something. I really need advice. Im not sure if i can cut them off completely because we also have shared friends and i just worry that they will be on my 'partners' side and not mine (im not trying to imply there are sides but since they are closer to my 'partner' they would probably have that bias) and i don't want their friends to message me about it. Also needed to add when i say that they did something that hurt my feelings they straight away get defensive rather than thinking about my feelings and how to comfort me and reassure me. AND they were the one who told me my ex was abusing me (this was before we got into a situationship and were still just friends) kinda funny how that is.",1711890224.0,False,3,1,nanamisbreedingkink,None,1bs9y14,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bs9y14/i_feel_trapped/

33,Chronic Numbness/Emptiness *mention of suicide*," 

So I am currently sitting here in front of my laptop and this is probably my tenth time in the past month trying to write out my feelings but every-time I tried to it felt so forced and fake. The numbness I feel is so debilitating it makes me feel like I’m not a person. I don't feel like I am real. Someone on reddit said that bpd emptiness specifically feels like constant numbness simultaneously accompanied with a heavy tension. It feels like there is constantly something weighing down my chest. But I cannot process what emotion this weight stems from. However, one feeling that I am able to feel is kind of a worry/fear. Because when I have gotten in these numb episodes in the past it has never ended well. It resulted in months or even years of my life wasted due to a lack of motivation, of care, of any effort at all. Because after a certain point of feeling empty you stop caring about everything in the world including yourself. 

I'm so scared of feeling the full extent of my emotions because every time I do I feel like a freak or a fucking monster and I always regret it afterwards. Repressing my emotions in the past has led me to self destructive behaviours like failing out of school, self harm, and using sex and drugs as an unhealthy coping mechanism to try to fill the void. As these episodes progress it causes my self hate to grow and grow to a point where it makes me suicidal, because while everything is getting worse and worse I am fully aware of how bad it is but I still can’t do anything to change it. This adds a constant guilty feeling over everything. The guilt of not doing anything to stop it. The guilt of knowing better but not doing better.

It feels like I’m digging myself a deeper hole with each day that passes with this emptiness. And thinking about pulling myself out of it makes me feel so exhausted and drained. It takes sooo much effort out of me to do so. Feeling the full extent of my emotions feels like walking into a battle field with no amour. And it never feels like it's worth it because in the end the cycle will restart and I will find myself deeper than the last rock bottom I rescued myself from. Apart of me knows that because of my bpd this cycle will not necessarily ever disappear because the trauma I’ve been through has rewired my brain chemistry in irreversible ways. However, I’ve been through enough therapy and read enough books to know that trauma is an inevitable part of life. I know that I have to accept the things that aren't  in my control and change the things that are. I know that trauma has both the possibility to shape people into success or failures and ultimately it’s up to me to make that decision. 

I've heard of stories of people altering their lives with therapy and developing healthier coping mechanisms but the question I always seem to come back to is how do they make it last long term? Why does it work for them and not me? I too have gone to the gym for 6 months consistently and have gone to therapy for months on end, ate a good diet and got 8 hours of sleep every night but there comes a point where slowly one by one each of those skills and coping mechanisms tip toe out the door one by one. Almost in a way where I don't notice it fully until they are all gone and I am left barren, all alone with the dark twisted corners of the inside of my head. No where to find comfort, no where to feel safe, no where to breathe smoothly. Each time I feel like an idiot for thinking the cycle is over.  Boom, I get a trigger I can’t handle. A trigger that the gym can’t take off my mind, or therapy sessions don't help with. There it is. Consuming me and swallowing me and I have to sit patiently waiting for it to spit me out so I can breathe again. So I can try again.

34,"I am ADHD, he is BPD (EUPD)","Long time lurker, first time poster.

So, ADHD is predominately diagnosed as a male condition but I am an adult, 32 year old woman, diagnosed with full spectrum ADHD! Whoop whoop! Energy for days! Bipolar Disorder (BPD/EUPD) is mainly diagnosed in women. However, my ex partner, 33 year old guy, has been diagnosed as EUPD. He feels everything! No matter how much I google I can’t seem to find any other couples that have had this dynamic. So, dear redditors, I call upon you to help me figure out whether or not this could be a healthy partnership should we both learn to appreciate the other?

We broke up in September 2019 due to financial problems and discovering he had addictions. So, that’s where the money went?!?! His behaviour became aggressive and me not fully grasping socially awkward situations probably aggravated him. No excuse for his behaviour, but equally I am extremely difficult to live with. Before September we were what I call the perfect couple. Holidaying with the kids, supportive of each other’s careers and he was extremely caring when it came to my ADHD (he was not diagnosed till after the relationship ended). Plus our sex life was out of this world!!! Like seriously, it was like a drug itself, being as it appears both impulsive in nature. 

So, we broke it off after some pretty serious arguments. Great, we can all move on with our lives!?!! Nope!!! Thing is, all that time before was PERFECT! Like I have never experienced! But being the stubborn cow I am I wasn’t about to tell him that. Then he messaged on Christmas and has been messaging a lot since then. Updates on his diagnosis, his medication and how he wants to date again. 

The question is, can an ADHDian and a BPDian have a healthy, happy relationship? And how is there such an attraction between two people with these traits?

35,"Trying to heal myself ,need some advice","I've been diagnosed with BPD since my teens (25 now). At the time I was addicted to drugs, cutting and one suicide attempt. Two hospital visits from that I met a guy who helped me get out of my rut , we lived together for 3 years with his support I finished nursing school and am currently a nurse. I ended up leaving him two years ago and had a streak of extremely unsuccessful relationships with very damaging people with warning signs so bright it took immense denial to stay in them. This last one really did a number on me and now it's over .. He left .. After all that lol. Now I'm trying to get over it, deal with feelings of depression but most of all my extremely deep feelings of loneliness, and insecurity. I've decided I need to start healing myself , started taking zyprexa ( which I have been on and off due to its SE of tiredness and drowsyness) . Zyprexa in particular BC it helps me eat , I have this obsession that if I gain 15 pounds everything will work out. I'm very thin I'm 5'2 90 lbs. I've been chain smoking a pack a day for a month.

36,My BPD,"Hi, I'm ""c*****y"" and I have BPD. 

I can't regulate my emotions on the outside, while I know what I'm doing on the inside is wrong, I continue to hurt those closest to me. I get a feeling of ice down my spine, and like I'm standing in line for a scary ride that NEVER comes. 
The only way to make this feeling go away is to act out and say all the mean, terrible things bottled up inside me. I feel relieved for roughly 15 seconds followed by intense immediate regret right after that sometimes linger.

I have put my husbands and my own job at risk several times because of situations like above. 

In the past I have battled a few demons (bolimia, anorexia, cutting, taking drugs, binge drinking to the point iv woken up naked in a strange place, drinking to the point of literally losing consciousness mid conversation and hitting the ground) 

Iv noticed its a control issue. My mother was an abusive absent mother. She didn't know what she was doing, she only knew how she was raised so I don't blame her fully. 

I was molested once at 6 months old by my uncle. 

I was molested on a regular basis by my grandmother until I was about 8

I was molested when I was 12 on my birthday by my moms drunk friend right in front of her. 

And I was raped when I was 19. 

My father left when I was 6

A man that was not my father had visitation rights to me from birth, and was even in the room and cut my cord knowing full well I was not his child. I had to go to his house every other weekend until I was 14 and realized it made no sense. He was a good guy though

I can control being hungry, full, high, drunk

I can't control the others

I feel so many emotions yet numb at the same time 

Its like, my mind cannot compute happiness. I know I feel it sometimes but I think I confuse it with anxiety or something because the feeling is newish.

I'm wishy washy. I will agree to something and for some reason as soon as I do I hate myself because I didn't really want to. 

I obsess over any and everything constanty. 
I'm ungrateful and mean for no reason sometimes and then super nice the others.

37,I don't know why I have BPD,"this is very long and i dont expect anyone to read it, its basically a breakdown of my life and how i went from a good little christian kid to whatever the fuck is going on with my life now
my bpd confuses me. I've always joked that I've was born with a broken heart because during my childhood, I can't really remember anything traumatic happening to me and I had a good home life, yet I loved sad music and I remember being very young, like 3-4 and praying to God (I was just raised religious and I am a trans man and those things did not mix well even though I didn't realize my gender identity was the cause of a lot of unrecognized dysphoria that I thought was just due to the fact that I was chubby until I was a Junior in high school) to take me to heaven now whenever I got yelled at. In middle school I always felt left out and inadequate. In high school, I was not popular and was never once pursued romantically or had reciprocated feelings for any of my classmates. And although I wasn't bullied, my roommate (religious boarding school)freshman often snuck out of our room to go hang out with our other friend and I remember spending nights crying and wondering why I wasn't enough for her. I started experiencing depressive episodes during the winter and during my sophomore year I tried to seek help because it wasn't going away during the spring this time and was met with a ""you seem fine you've got that real Jesus joy in your heart"". and then junior year I went into a depressive episode that hasn't really seemed to lift completely to this day. I cut myself daily and isolated myself a lot and started gaining weight, something that I hated because I was already overweight and hated my body. I remember praying and crying and wondering why I was feeling like this and why this was happening to me. I viewed myself as lazy, worthless, unloveable, and a complete failure at the ripe age of 17. I lost my faith, my ambitions, everything. I also realized that I was bisexual and trans and this further worsened the depression because I knew my parents would not approve. I was hiding everything from them and trying to hold myself together and ""cure"" myself by using a horrible system of cutting myself for not completing chores/homework that I needed to complete but had 0 motivation or energy to do. I wanted to take my life, but before I could work up the nerve to I opened up to my parents about how I was feeling about everything about the LGBT stuff. they got me an online Christian counselor who helped but I was still dealing with the LGBT aspects of my issues because I was afraid of being kicked out of my school or being sent to conversion therapy. I knew I couldn't deny these aspects of my identity because I knew they were things that I couldn't change, the problem was that every single person in my life was, although most not aggressively, homophobic and transphobic. I saw a light of sorts at the end of the tunnel at graduation, and I figured if I could just make it out of high school and shatter the glass ceiling on my current life, then everything would be better. Senior year I took Lexapro and it didn't really seem to help, but I continued to take it. Unfortunately I gained more weight because of binge eating and was around 240lbs, not that much but I was easily one of the largest people in my school. I had an online girlfriend who told me she loved me and then later said she never meant it when we broke up. I started smoking cigarettes and weed and spent a lot of my time alone because half of the time when I tried to hang out with anyone I felt like I didn't really belong. I felt like a lot like I was on the outside of my own life and looking in. At this point I was also very bad and still am at taking care of myself, which I am very embarrassed about and am working on. I didn't shower as much as I should, I woke up with only 5 minutes to get to class, and really just kind of blundered through life because I was using all my energy on just keeping myself alive. Finally, I graduated, and things looked like they were getting better. I came out to my parents, and my previous good relationship with them tanked. things were weird, they acted like I was this whole new person but I still felt like I was just me. This hurt because of the obvious disapproval of the true me, in identity and opinions and personal values. this is still a source of contention with my dad mostly but I've learned to just tolerate his unacceptance of my gender identity. I felt alone and ostracized in my own house and college was the way I finally began to branch out into the real world. I met my best friend, began smoking weed daily which I think has proven mostly beneficial to me but I will not deny this may be problematic as well. I hung out with my new friend and then her friends who have become most of my current social circle daily and was never in the house. I took a break from college which turned into dropping out because I was changing career paths and found my passion in dog grooming, which was great. as I worked and had money to spend though, problems began arising. at this point I had started to feel somewhat out of control of myself, staying up too late before working in the morning, starting to do party drugs occasionally like Ecstasy, ect. while at home feeling like I was stuck in the past. I noticed that when I was out with my friends and living my own life, I was happy and although erratic and overly sensitive to feeling the need to belong and be inlcluded in everything, but as soon as i stepped foot through the door of my house i could feel my mood start to tank. I only even slept on nights when i worked in the morning. I felt the need to be able to do everything with my new friends and keep up, and i deeply needed them to like me. I was still unhappy with my weight, although beginning to like my appearance as i was able to present as my true gender. I am a hopeless romantic and have always wanted to settle down and get married. I had a lot of trouble finding love and felt unnattractive and undesirable. I also spent my money impulsively and was often broke and struggled to make it through a week on a part time paycheck. Because i spent so much time away from home and didn't have much money, I often skipped meals in favor of a pack of cigs or whatever random thing i was focused on. Because i was eating less and stiffled my appetite with cigarettes, i started to notice a loss of weight. I have never been athletic and especially now since i ran myself ragged constantly socializing or working, I've never consistently worked out or really seen any weight loss. So I started to skip meals on purpose occasionally and not just to save money. I desperately wanted to be skinny, something I've never been. It didnt get to be a problem until later when i really started to drop weight. First though, in late 2018 I met my current boyfriend and although it's only been about a year and a half, I'm certain he's the love of my life, and he feels the same. However, with all good things there are problems. He had a rough childhood and because of it has a lot of very difficult mental problems himself. At this point, i had stopped taking my meds after beginning walbutrin to combat how dull lexapro made me feel emotionally at times. I didnt like how irritable it made me and i barely remembered to take my meds anyways, and i was feeling elated with a new relationship and thought it was a good idea. i don't regret it because although i spiralled into a depression enough to admit myself to a hospital for a short while. They diagnosed me with bipolar 2 which didnt really seem to fit right since the hospital seemed to diagnose everyone with some kind of bipolar disorder and gave everyone abilify, the worst medication i have ever taken. Meanwhile, my boyfriend, B, was going through one of the worst mental health years of his life, and I tried to support him the best that I could. I definitely tended to ignore my own needs to help his objectively much more serious issues. I was also doing more drugs and just got a promotion from bather to groomer and had to transfer to a new store. I was very close to my coworkers at my first store but i didnt fit in with the other salon workers at the new location. I was feeling very out of touch with my social circle and extremely stressed out. Then one day, B had a very bad dissociative episode and didn't recognize me. I felt completely useless and pointless, especially since that morning I had also slept through my alarm for work; again. I remeber bursting into tears before getting my best friend, who i now lived with, to comfort B because I all I could think to do run. I then left the house and got into my car fall apart. I noticed Bs nightmare medication and zoloft, and without a second thought downed the entire bottle of prazosin and drove to a park. I then swallowed a handful of zoloft for good measure before i got a call from my best friend. When i got back to the house (god knows how i didnt wreck my car because i was definitely starting to feel the effects) They knew what was up immediately and then I was hospitalized for a second time, only a month after the first visit. Before my first hospital visit, I discovered one of my worst vices: cocaine. While i enjoyed other drugs, not counting weed, I didn't really care to seek them out on my own. But i fell in love with coke. i loved the way it made me feel physically, and finally the persistent exhaustion of being alive lifted and i felt like i could actually focus on something long enough to accomplish it. I was a nasty habit that gave me panic attacks, made me somehow even broker, and by the end of it I had gone from 240lbs to 160lbs since it made not eating even easier. I was also even more tired and irritated constantly. Thankfully my best friend had dealt with an eating disorder in highschool and called me out and helped me start eating better again. And then B and I tried meth. It was amazing, but it was also the fucking worst. We only did it twice, and the first time I personally only had a long, irritating comedown, but B dissociated so hard he thought he was 16 again for 3 days. The next time we did it i started to see things and have panic attacks at the thought of having to go to work in the morning. I called into work and that day we broke up because I wanted to get clean and he didn't. The next day we talked when we were clear headed we got back together, him now ready to quit too. I'm incredibly lucky that we got out when we did from meth because it would have destroyed us. Its something i still fear that I'll relapse into again, even though i dont really miss it except when I'm feeling especially dead inside. I told my mom about my drug use and this prompted a visit to a new psychiatrist who diagnosed me with BPD. It's nice to finally find a diagnosis that seemed to actually fit. I'm doing better right now, relatively. I found a medication that actually works, thank god for trileptal, B and I are mostly sober, the hardest thing we do now is acid every now and then, and we still smoke, just probably too much now. I've started DBT but had to stop because i got a new job and it didn't fit into my schedule, but now im on job number 3 of 2020 and its much more loosely scheduled so i can actually focus on my mental health for once in my life.
Anyways, the question I wanted to ask is I don't understand still why I have BPD. Everyone talks about how childhood trauama can ""cause"" it, and I know depression runs in the family, but not BPD. I come from a stable home where I was loved, although not really accepted but that wasn't until later on after my mental health started tanking. I feel guilty about it, and I can't help but think that I took a start for a good life and just shit all over it. I feel like such a family disappointment and I feel like im going to be stuck on this random, emotional rollercoaster forever and I'll just continue to destroy every good thing in my life. If i could pinpoint it to anything, I would think my roommate in freshman year sneaking out of our room might have been the start of the extreme fear of abandonment, but that seems like such a stupid, not traumatic or abusive at all thing to have caused me to go from who I was before, someone i can barely even remember what they were even like in terms of personality, to the dumpster fire ive become. Maybe theres some repressed memory of something happening to me, because I get asked if I was ever sexually assualted a lot, but I have no memory of anything like that ever happening and while I don't have a problem having sex mentally my body just doesn't seem to react that well to anyone other than myself. Maybe my brain chemistry is just that fucked that sometime as simple as a friend hanging out with someone else sometimes set it off. I just want to get to the root of the issue, any insight or if y'all also just want to spill your entire life story onto the internet feel free and I'll listen to you. Take care guys

38,I can’t believe I’m doing this,"TRIGGER WARNING: suicide, self harm and all that bad mental health stuff. (Sorry if I did that wrong). 

Hi redditors. I’ve never posted before. Thanks for reading and responding if you choose to do so. I’m sorry if the following triggers you or if you are struggling with the same brand of futile terrible I am. 

I’m at a point in my life where I’ve struggled so much and for so long that I’m just exhausted. I’m not angry or bitter or sad anymore; I just want it to be over. I’m tired of being confused all the time, completely disconnected from this thing called ‘life’ everyone seems to be switched into. I’m tired of being panicky and depressed and anxious all at the same time, almost all the time. Im tired of being at the mercy of my insane mood swings where I'm experiencing overlapping interchanges of all these conflicting emotions all day long. I'm tired of crying so often that it feels like my brain is going to explode in my own head and my eyes will just cease to function properly. I’m tired of being dismissed when I say I’m unwell (psychiatrist included) because ‘I’m doing so well’ - I don’t even know what this means or how you could conclude that from someone whose chronically unemployed, can’t finish uni or even leave the house or make eye contact with people without panicking. I feel like an absolute rotting turd most of the time despite what I’m putting out there (which feels to me like a shit show but to other people for some reasons seems completely normal).

People seem to consistently make this crazy assumption that I’m ‘intelligent and capable’ for some reason and therefore I don’t need help. They couldn’t be more wrong. I can’t accomplish basic tasks because I’m emotionally all over the place all the time and trying to do basic human things like pick what to wear in the morning sends me into shame spirals, suicidal thoughts and urges to self harm. I have no control over my emotions or impulses, I’m constantly floating away from my body and nothing feels real. I’m incapable of accepting any kind of affection or goodwill from others without completely self destructing and I don’t want to burden others so my relationships are nonexistent. 

I’ve dealt with thoughts, feelings, urges and attempts of suicide my entire life. Its pretty much always been a terrifying backup in the back of my mind ever since I can remember as a safety plan to escape the torture of life where I can always feel exactly how close I am to death. Some days feel a magnetism to it but a strong resolve to resist. Other days, I’m basically hanging on by a thread and not telling anyone so they don’t come and take me from my home against my will again. 

I just want the freedom to be able to make this decision on my own. I did not give consent to be born, and I don’t think it’s ethical to keep someone alive against their will when they are suffering chronically and there isn’t a solution. 

I just feel like there’s no way out. I don’t respond to medications and suffer from such severe side effects that my psychiatrist refuses to prescribe any more drugs. My old psychiatrist had me on 5 different meds and I was equally bad, maybe worse, but in a completely different way. Those who have had adverse reactions to medications will understand this. Being mentally ill or being on psychiatric medication is like choosing if you want death by drowning or self-immolation.

I do DBT group therapy, see a psychologist and psychiatrist but I still feel like absolute shit. Everyone seems to be going through the motions, ticking all the boxes, but I just feel like nothing has really shifted. No amount of bandaids is going to help me when I’m walking around absolutely raw with no fucking skin on my body. It’s excruciating to just be alive but because it’s not visible, and it’s a slow death, nobody cares and the state ‘has a responsibility’ to keep you alive. In my experience, everyone is all sad when someone kills them selves, but also calls them selfish because they’ve left so much pain in their wake. Being passed around a mental health care system that can’t really help you, is insanely expensive and practically useless makes me miss the days when I didn’t seek help, suffered in silence but could at least hold on to the hope that there was a possibility of getting better if I had the right help. Now I know that’s not even an option. 

I’m just doomed to relive this cycle of extreme pain, possible suicide, absurdity, exhaustion, sheer terror, panic attacks, extreme mood swings, paranoia, catatonia, confusion, dissociation, spontaneous stuttering, paralysis and fatigue, where I can’t seem to express myself clearly no matter how hard I try or connect with other people. 

I am incapable of feeling positive emotions. No matter how hard I try, I just can’t stop the anxiety, panic, negativity, paranoia and depression from seeping in. I fear my emotions, I fear my thoughts and the things in life I can’t control that are going to hurt me so I just live in a constant state of sheer paralysis, frozen in fear and bracing myself for impact.

The only thing that’s keeping me alive is the thought that my sister will have to deal with the trauma of my suicide. But it also seems like it should be unethical to keep a person in this much chronic pain alive. I can feel my body deteriorating, my mind is basically scrambled eggs at this point, and I feel like I’m at the mercy of an emotionally handicapped body that I have zero control over. I keep harming myself and those around me. I just want to die with a little bit of dignity but there doesn’t seem to be a way out.

Life seems to be one trauma after the next, and continued reluctant attempts to help myself that only end up in things getting worse. I was not made for this world. I wasn’t supposed to be here. Please let me go. I don’t want to hurt anyone but I’m so tired now. Please tell me this will all be over soon.",1596368916.0,False,11,7,sarahthehumanperson,None,i2asxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/i2asxt/i_cant_believe_im_doing_this/
39,Canadian mental health's week,"This week is Canadian mental health’s week.

I cannot remain silent. I have witnessed so many prejudices related to different mental illnesses. And I have been victim myself of some prejudices related to my mental illness.

I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and I have an eating disorder (ED). 

I am trying really hard to recover from my eating disorder. It has been a year since I am in therapy and take medication. Even though I am on the path of recovery, I am still sick. My day-to-day existence is still challenging. I have been victim of many misconceptions people have about my disease. Today, I want to break those misconceptions. 

First of all, I have gone to my family doctor before my eating disorder went out of control. I’ve told my doctor I was worried about the relationship I had with food. I’ve told her that every time I felt angry, sad or anxious about something, I ate. I’ve told her that I often got up at night to eat things I didn’t allow myself to eat at daytime. I’ve told her that I was sometimes craving for junk food. I’ve told her that I was often eating so much that I felt a pain in my stomach. I’ve also told her that I was constantly checking my weight because I was worried that I was weighing more than my friends. Those are the common symptoms of an eating disorder. My doctor didn’t take me seriously. She didn’t consider my eating behaviors as a problem. Actually, she told me it was quite common among teenagers to like junk food and to eat “too much”. 

For a couple of years, back in high school, my eating behaviors remain the same. I was stealing money from my mother’s purse to buy junk food. I was hiding food in places where my mother could not find it such as my room’s closet. I had drawers filled with wrappers. 

Then, it got worse. Two years ago, I had convinced myself that I had some kind of virus and that I couldn’t digest food anymore. For a week, I had stopped eating. My close ones were worried but they didn’t question my behavior because I had convinced them I had a virus. When I started to eat again, food disgusted me so much that I felt like I couldn’t keep it: I had to throw it all away. And that is what I started to do.  At first, I told my parents that I was throwing up because of the virus. But, it kept getting worse. I could barely eat with them. And when I did, I ate a ridiculously small amount of food. I was throwing up after each meal. And I had started to skip meals. In a matter of a few months, I had lost a lot a weight (something like 25 pounds). At one point, I couldn’t concentrate at school anymore. I was feeling weak. I was feeling anxious around others. At that time, all I wished for was to disappear completely. I told my parents I needed to go to therapy. I knew something was wrong but I didn’t know what it was. My first therapist diagnosed me with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), related to a sexual assault I had been victim of a couple of years before.  Then, I was diagnosed with Depression. Then, I was diagnosed with social anxiety. Then, they found out I had an eating disorder: I was diagnosed with bulimia nervosa. Finally, after a suicide attempt and a stay at the hospital, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). 

I have found it really difficult to hear about the final diagnosis because I knew that this one was accurate. When my therapist first described to me the symptoms of BPD, all I could think was: «It is me. It is all me. Is it all that I am? Am I a disease?» For those of you who don’t know much about BPD, there are nine specific symptoms to this illness but you only need to have five of them to be diagnosed with it. First of all, BPDs fear abandonment. That’s why BPDs make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. Because of that fear of abandonment, BPDs have unstable relationships. BPDs relationships are often intense and short-lived. Also, BPDs have unstable self-image. BPDs may feel good about themselves for a short period of time and then hate themselves. BPDs often don’t know their needs and desires. They may change values, goals, and even sexual identity. Because of their unclear self-image, BPDs engage in impulsive or self-destructive behaviors such as self-harm, risky sex, alcohol or drug abuse, binge eating. Those self-destructive behaviors can lead to suicidal behavior. BPDs also have intense emotional swings. They are described as hypersensitive. In fact, Marsha Linehan, the psychologist whom invented Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), which is now used to treat people with BPD, says: 
“People with BPD are like people with third degree burns over 90% of their bodies. Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement.” BPDs also experiences chronic feelings of emptiness due to their unstable self-image and their lack of self-confidence. BPDs can also struggle with intense anger and can have trouble controlling it. More frequently, BPDs direct their anger towards them. Finally, BPDs can experience episodes of paranoia where they feel suspicious about other’s motives and out of touch with reality.  That feeling can lead to out of body’s experiences. 

After I was diagnosed with BPD, I knew I had to tell my close ones. The impact of the symptoms on my life was so important: I could not pretend that they did not exist anymore. My therapist had warned me that the reactions to my diagnosis could be quite inadequate due to all the misconceptions people have about mental illnesses. Unfortunately, people often see BPD’s desperate calls for help as attention seeking. For example, that is often the way people feel about self-harm and suicidal behavior. Another common misconception is that people think that all BPD sufferers are extroverts. People think all BPDs express their intense emotions at the exact moment they feel them. In fact, some of us keep a lot of those emotions to ourselves. Sometimes, it is because we are not sure how to express those feelings. Sometimes, it is because we don’t even know how we feel: there are so many emotions trapped inside of us that ask to be released.  If you know someone suffering from BPD or from any other mental illness, you have to know there is no magic way to cure for those illnesses. The person who suffers from a mental illness has to be ready to recover and that feeling can only come from her. There is nothing you can do except stand by her side while she is trying her best to recover.  

I hope that my statement will help to demystify BPD and Bulimia Nervosa among some of you. And, I hope that those of you who suffer from any mental illness will feel less lonely. I also hope it will encourage you to speak up to stop the stigmatization of mental illnesses.
