0,Not sure where to start,"I am an empty carnivorous black hole with no financial means to acquire a therapist or PHP program. Where do I start to put myself back together again? I've already gone through in-patient and did the talk therapy for a couple years... lied my entire way through it(hid an abusive relationship for two years). I'm aware of DBT, but I truly will not have access to a medical professional until probably 2025. How do I make myself palatable? At this point, I hate every single friend that I have due to extreme jealousy that they arent so empty and useless or for other reasons that don't matter. They just all annoy me so much and its so hard to be around them right now because I am so miserable. I don't want to lose everybody I care about because I am insufferable.

1,Just got diagnosed.,"Hey guys. (Sorry for confusion I’m new here:))
I (24F) am in DBT outpatient treatment. Just finished 3 weeks of the PHP program. And now on IOP. Which is just 3 days a week for 3 hours a day. The PHP program was 9am-3pm Monday through Friday which I felt like I had a purpose and I was doing something. 
Anyways I guess what I need to let you all know is I was diagnosed with GAD and MDD when I was 16-17 after that went down a slippery slope of drugs (literally all of them) until I did acid at 20... and  thought I lost my freaking MIND lol (funny because having bpd you feel that way anyways) 
I always knew I was “off” or something. 
Fast forward 2 and a half years I was sober and fine.. so I thought. 
Here came the panic attacks, depression. Angry outbursts, quitting jobs, threatening to hurt myself. 
I knew I needed help or I was gonna go right back down the same bad road.
I found an (ACT) therapist that I’ve been seeing every Monday give or take for almost 2 years.. I think . I’ve also held down a job for a little over a year. At this job I had a breakdown that sent me to the doctors and that’s how I made it to the treatment center. I said all this to say now I’ve been diagnosed with BPD. .. idk what to do with that. 
Idk who that is but that’s not me. 
I have a loving boyfriend that doesn’t deserve to deal with all these emotions. 
Any advice?",1697112867.0,False,1,0,Maleficent-Click2,None,1765j67,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1765j67/just_got_diagnosed/

3,Sponsors?,"Hello, I have just started a partial hospitalization program and am taking my recovery from BPD more seriously. A friend, who is in 12 step, recommended I find someone like a sponsor for my journey and I think this is a great idea.

The biggest difficulty for me is that I do not have a space to meet potential sponsors. As with most PHP groups, we are not allowed to contact each other outside of group until we're both discharged. So, I have come to reddit. I was thinking perhaps this could be a thread to match each other, if we feel comfortable.

If you think you'd be a good match for me feel free to send a DM. If you don't think so, that's okay, and  I welcome you to post what you're looking for!

&#x200B;

For myself, I live in Seattle and would love to find someone local. I understand we're currently all at home for COVID, so I am happy to start virtually but I'd love to find someone who I could perhaps get coffee with sometimes, but this is not required. It is very important to me to find someone who is also professionally diagnosed and in treatment, especially if you are doing or have ever done PHP or IOP. At this point, I'd say my BPD is moderately managed and I am looking for support with someone who is also somewhat managed. My goal is remission, I hope yours is too!

Because this is a possible tigger I want to say that I am active in ageplay. If you are triggered by ageplay, dd/lg type dynamics, I will probably not be a good fit for you.",1586276492.0,False,5,1,xoxoaspey,None,fwne8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/fwne8a/sponsors/
