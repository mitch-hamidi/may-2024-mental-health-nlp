0,Just got diagnosed.,"Hey guys. (Sorry for confusion I’m new here:))
I (24F) am in DBT outpatient treatment. Just finished 3 weeks of the PHP program. And now on IOP. Which is just 3 days a week for 3 hours a day. The PHP program was 9am-3pm Monday through Friday which I felt like I had a purpose and I was doing something. 
Anyways I guess what I need to let you all know is I was diagnosed with GAD and MDD when I was 16-17 after that went down a slippery slope of drugs (literally all of them) until I did acid at 20... and  thought I lost my freaking MIND lol (funny because having bpd you feel that way anyways) 
I always knew I was “off” or something. 
Fast forward 2 and a half years I was sober and fine.. so I thought. 
Here came the panic attacks, depression. Angry outbursts, quitting jobs, threatening to hurt myself. 
I knew I needed help or I was gonna go right back down the same bad road.
I found an (ACT) therapist that I’ve been seeing every Monday give or take for almost 2 years.. I think . I’ve also held down a job for a little over a year. At this job I had a breakdown that sent me to the doctors and that’s how I made it to the treatment center. I said all this to say now I’ve been diagnosed with BPD. .. idk what to do with that. 
Idk who that is but that’s not me. 
I have a loving boyfriend that doesn’t deserve to deal with all these emotions. 
Any advice?",1697112867.0,False,1,0,Maleficent-Click2,None,1765j67,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1765j67/just_got_diagnosed/
1,I can’t afford DBT and I don’t know what to do.,"Hi all,

Hope you’re doing as well as you can today. Remember your best IS good enough.

Long rant to begin with?

I got diagnosed with BPD in November 2023. I was lucky and able to access three months of outpatient treatment through the public hospital. (In Australia for context).

I am middle aged. I have the BPD trait of impulse spending. I wised up to building “wealth” and had a small bit of savings after working on saving for 18 months. I have never owned property, always rented and now my minimum wage doesn’t cover rent (and I’m gracefully living with my elderly / ill father. I don’t know how long he’s got.)

I quit my job (3 weeks before BPD diagnosis) because of my abusive boss and his horrible daughter. They both made my life hell, I was working 12-14 hour days. He threatened all employees (not just me) but the threat of “we’re going to put you in a PIP and terminate you” was too much to bear. I am the extreme of sensitive and cry at the drop of a hat. It’s crap. It had some savings behind me, however, I was unemployed for months and they soon disappeared.

I was bullied as a kid for being poor. I was bullied in high school for being socially awkward / different / gay. I’ve never had a lot of “true” friends, and without my dad, i don’t really have someone to reach out to.

I used to be conventionally attractive and rather healthy in my teens. When I finished high school, I lost my first serious relationship where my BPD symptoms were all over the place. My fault 100%. I sometimes go back and write to apologise to them, but choose not to. It brings up too much.

In university I made many friends and for a good 10 or so years we connected, they were accepting of my quirks, life was ok.

Then COVID happened.

(We know how that panned out. Still panning out.)

I also lost friends because of different life paths and how that stuff goes. No one did any wrong, we just drifted apart.

Then when things got back to some sort of “normal”; I joined a queer affirming church (religion does play a part in my heart, however, I do not condone abuse, murder, exclusion, and extortion in the name of Religion.)

I’ve made some friends there. They all live rather far away and I haven’t been to church since my diagnosis.

I also got a new job in March and I am enjoying it. There are a few downsides, yet only one that irks me.

There is a woman I work with. She is approximately 10 years younger than me. She is one of those “sickly sweet types” (100% me issue, not her issue. I know this.)

So far she has stated:
- Her fiancé has bought her a 170,000 car
- She controls all finances and her fiancés money is put into her account. 
- She had her braces, current car, and all overseas travel paid for by her brother.
- She is about to marry a man who is about to inherit millions of dollars.

She’s definitely a bit of a BS artist; I think we all can be, as life is tough. However, ever since her arrival my BPD has flared up. I am poor. Always have been, always will be if I don’t change my life.

As DBT costs 21,000 AUD + and is often ran during the day (when I’m at work); I cannot access it. 

My executive disfunction is rife too.

I am not close to my siblings as they are generations older and have their own lives. My extended family isn’t close either; my mum was an only child and dad avoided his family due to trauma. I don’t have many friends and I can guarantee I am sh*t at being a friend.

I am so lonely, facing tough times because Australia is only for the rich; and I can’t move countries to try something different. I only work in admin and I suck at crafts (but enjoy them). I enjoy reading too.

If you’ve made it this far, you’re amazing! Thank you for reading my ranting.

My question is: where do I start? I’m terrified of everything and spend every day suffering from s******l idealisation multiple times a day. I’m sick of feeling this way and know I could try and make a better life, so why can’t I?",1715481572.0,False,6,8,TiredSleepyGrumpy,None,1cpxs35,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1cpxs35/i_cant_afford_dbt_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/
2,Is it wrong if i identify with BPD even if i didn't get diagnosed with it? i genuinely feel like i have BPD," 

In 2017 i got a psych assessment when i was barely 18 years old, they concluded i had OCD withNPD/BPD traits, they decided to not diagnose me with BPD/NPD because of my level of impairment. I however know that i have BPD because of the symptoms i have displayed since i was a kid and primarily since i was 17, which is the age where it became gradually worse, and now at age 21 has reached a tipping point.

i Have a childhood diagnosis of Intellectual Disability, and recently (yesterday) they brought up the idea of possible Autism Spectrum Disorder, and many times have said they didn't think i had BPD, however i am still reluctant to accept the idea i don't have a personality disorder.

Over the course of 3 years and self diagnosis, BPD has been the core of my identity. I have felt humiliated and excessively obsessive when i tell people i only have ''traits'' as i feel it severely invalidates my trauma and the pain i face everyday.

I have told people online/offline that i have BPD, and i seem embedded in my rigid delusion that i genuinely have this disorder, I feel as if the psychiatric system has let me down and has not provided accurate results because i am a male, and because of my disability. I was referred to a dual disability/mental health hospital as an outpatient for a 2nd assessment and will receive a diagnosis in 2 weeks, however BPD still seems unlikely to them.

The reason i relate to BPD so much is because of the behaviors i have, i can relate to ''BPD feels like having 3rd degree burns'', and i basically struggle with substance abuse, self harm, anger which is often irrational, and i don't know who or what i am as a person, and i have severe abandonment issues, i also experience extreme irritability over the smallest of things and will split on someone, from all good to all bad, rejection sensitivity, getting attached to people and wanting to marry them after a day, i've also struggled with thoughts of violence, homicide, arson, and grandiose beliefs. You can see my comment history and outbursts on reddit.

My psychiatrist told me that this time i will receive accurate results, and that he and his other 3 colleagues who are psychiatrists are working extensively to give me the diagnosis they see fitting",1588650131.0,False,2,2,babyboi1998,None,gdqhxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/gdqhxy/is_it_wrong_if_i_identify_with_bpd_even_if_i/
3,Venting," 

Im sitting here writing to myself again. Everything is falling apart. I feel weaker than ever. I feel like my mom hates me. She said that I am a shame to my father who abandoned me and that she has done nothing as a mother. I have never felt so much pain in my life. I sobbed like a toddler in front of her. Because she knows that I blame myself for my father leaving me. She knows how much I fear abandonment. So for her to confirm that even my abusive and alcoholic father would be ashamed of me hurt more than anything could ever. She said “look at you, I did nothing.”She feels like she failed as a mother and in result of that I am a failure of a daughter. We failed each other. after I told her how I felt and opened up to my struggles she didn’t respond to anything I said and only made an issue out of the fact that if anyone were to find out about what’s going on all the blame would be put onto her. While I opened up to her about my bpd diagnosis and how I feel on a daily basis she was only concerned about how it would make her look as a mother. She says every-time I have a breakdown its the same story and same excuses. Which is true because none of these issues have ever been truly addressed and worked on. I can sit here and provide reasons as to why but it would sound like excuses and manipulation so I give up. I failed and I am a shame just like my father to her. She says my father still controls me and its true. I just don’t know how to stop it. I want to get help but all outpatient treatment options have several week/month waitlists, and although I have signed up for them I feel like I don’t have that time. She wants change immediately. She wants me to go cold turkey and suddenly change my life around to happiness and butterflies. Because if other people can do it so can I. But I just don’t believe that. No matter how much I try I just cannot. 

She thinks that I purposely do things to disrespect her (smoking weed). I know that smoking weed is destructive, it is my addiction. She believes that addiction is a choice. She kept saying if I wanted to change I would. To her it is simple. She does not understand the complexity of my mind and the things it makes me do. She believes that I am purposely manipulative. She thinks I don’t want to put in any effort. She thinks I am choosing to be a victim but she doesn’t understand that trauma traps the person in a victim mindset. That a person with untreated trauma is constant living in the exact state of the time of trauma. They are stuck reliving the trauma if it is untreated. She doesn’t understand how it affects the brain. She doesn’t understand that not everyone is the same. That just because she was able to deal with all of her trauma (that was  much worse than mine) doesn’t mean that I can do the same. I am not the same as her, but she expects me to be. She doesn’t understand that my thought processes are corrupted and that in order for me to regain control of it I NEED therapy, I need to learn how to unlearn and rewire my brain to adopt healthy coping mechanisms and thought processes. She doesn’t believe that therapy can help you help yourself. She believes its all a business and that people use mental illness diagnosis as an excuse for their bad behaviour. She keeps telling me to help myself but I literally cannot do it on my own. She keeps telling me to do the same thing over and over again expecting a different outcome. Dealing with my trauma alone will never work. I can accept that but she cannot. 

I am sick and she doesn’t understand that. Because she is angry at me and angry at herself. Angry at me because she thinks I don’t want to put in any effort and angry at herself for creating a child like me. 

I feel alone. And I feel like all of my negative thoughts about myself were confirmed by her. Because I don’t think that people understand to what degree people with BPD hate themselves. The self hate is debilitating and constant. Ever since I can remember I have absolutely hated everything about my being. And when you don’t care for yourself, you make decisions that reflect that. The self destruction I engage in is not intended to hurt others it is only intended to hurt myself, because I feel worthy of hurt and pain. When I am in these long periods of numbness it is true I lose my sense of empathy. All sense of any emotion. And it causes me to hurt her. Because I am unable to even consider her feelings. I am sick and I hate it. I hate what I do.

I understand her anger because it is the same way I feel about myself. I just wish she could understand me. I wish we could break the wall in-between us. But every time she says things out of anger it makes me want to build the wall higher and stronger.",1652030374.0,False,15,7,ImpossibleBicycle249,None,ul6h66,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/ul6h66/venting/
