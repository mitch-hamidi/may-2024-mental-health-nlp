0,I lost myself,"I used to have such a strong identity in high school. I was sure of my self, probably a bit thick skulled- but I was a person. 

I still had issues, but I managed them much better. 

Then as I went into adulthood and started facing isolation, rejection, career rejection, toxic relationships, breakups, homelessness, domestic violence, hospitalization, more and more hardship on my own and often stacked on top of each other, my sense of self eroded into nothing. 

After my last break up my brain went blank. I moved back in with my mother and had to give up everything that once gave me joy and identity. 

That was almost two years ago. 

Trying to be myself hurt me so deeply and set me back a great deal. 

Now I wake up everyday wishing someone could tell me who to be so my life can work out. 

I don’t have any real hobbies, a job, money, friends, a relationship, I have nothing going for me at all. 

I can’t afford therapy to help myself. 

What can I do to become a person again. ",1710851964.0,False,6,3,inspo-posterkitten,None,1bij8xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bij8xz/i_lost_myself/
1,Not a good day ,"My mom started using the fact that I'm in bail (previous post explains why but before you immediately assume I'm the worst it was for accidently breaking a door at a hospital.  Nothing violent/sexual) to scare me all the time saying she regrets helping me out ""my friends say I shouldn't have"" (ftr my mom's ""friends"" are all her Mormon relatives who hate me for having long hair etc) and she kept saying I was a loser for not working when I DO have a job and it was my day off.  Even though it was my day off I was working on a level design project which, while in the form of a mod, is something I'm using to eventually use as a kind of resume but she wouldn't understand and thought I was just being lazy.  Then I freaked out and punched through the dry wall and went for a drive with my dogs.  Then my mom asked me to come back home.  My hand is super bruised which surprises me because when I was in jail I would punch the shit out of a concrete wall and it never bruised.  
I developed a plan with my therapist for my family to help me work on but every time I try to discuss it with my mom she pulls the ""your an adult man"" and ""embrace the suck"" type stuff and says I can't tell her what to do.  I feel heartbroken sometimes like my mom doesn't love me bases her whole life on peer pressure from the LDS Church and worries so much about how they will view her that she will throw me under the bus or if fear she will look bad.  

I don't know how the fuck my mom and more importantly the hospital think I'm going to be able to pay for my debt and that door I broke if I'm in jail and not working.  To make it worse the hospital billed over a thousand dollars for the 1 hour I was INVOLUNTARILY kept in the ER.   THE WHOLE TIME I WAS IN THERE THEY DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE EVEN CLEAN MY CUTS LET ALONE STITCH ME UP OR HELP ME WITH MY SEVERE ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL THAT'S WHY I FREAKED OUT AND RAN AWAY

Edit.  It wasn't 1 hour it was actually 4.  But they gave me no medication or any treatment of any kind.  I sat in a room and occasionally the security and nurses would come to vaguely mumble at me and remind me I couldn't leave",1710133691.0,False,2,2,Expensive-Bid9426,None,1bbvfxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bbvfxz/not_a_good_day/
2,I’ve been in a depressive state for 4 days ,"
I went to the hospital today to emergency to admit myself, at the moment I don't feel suicidal or at harm to others or myself, but I haven't been able to eat in 4 days, I can't go to work I can't move unless I have to go to the bathroom, I feel physical pain from how depressed I am. usually I get like this if something happens to make me feel this way but nothing has really happened, if anything I think I've just been in survival mode for so long that my brain and body don't know what to do anymore and I just feel stuck and sick. Anyway the hospital told me ""ur just in a depressed state and u will be fine in a couple or days to a week just go home take some time off work and go on walks or get up and do something"", I just looked at them and cried and said what am I suppose to do I can't get up and go for a walk l've tried I literally went in the shower for 1 min and had to get out I just can't seem to do anything, what if I'm still like this in a week from now then what do I do? The nurse said ""if ur still feeling like this ima week then come back"". I feel so worthless I feel so alone, my mental health is ruining my relationships I don't know what to do I went to the one place that I thought could help me and I was turned away. Why do I have to be on the brink of death to get help, all I want is help, I have a trip planned that I spent so much money on and I'm rat even excited or happy to go, my brain is sick a v there something wrong with me I just with people would listen to me",1712701759.0,False,5,3,Paigedacorpse,None,1c05bcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1c05bcq/ive_been_in_a_depressive_state_for_4_days/
3,I think i’m spiraling.,"TW: TRAUMA, DEATH, S_!C!DE 

so me (18F) has bpd incorporated with bipolar 1 symptoms (my psychiatrist told me that and i’ve literally never heard of that), i’ve been keeping a relationship for maybe about 6-7 months. which is amazing for me but i’m seriously struggling mentally with myself. i’ve been having ptsd flashbacks of my deceased grandmother (i was very very close with her and saw her dead as a ‘vegetable’) so i have difficulty with shit because life’s no fun when you get a vivid visual of someone you love dead with their eyes open. i have been dropping weight recently because food looks like her corpse and i can’t eat it because it feels disgusting and wrong. i was friends with my bf (18M) for 2 years prior to dating and opened up to him and so he knows me fairly well. i try to turn to him for support maybe last minute when i’m already about to explode with pent up emotions but i don’t know if he just actually doesn’t really understand or if he’s choosing to not even try to understand. but i’ve been feeling unwanted. genuinely by everyone and it’s been a feeling for a while but people will sometimes say a remark that fuels it and really kinda hurts. i feel like what i do is wrong no matter how much i try to do right. i want to express this to my boyfriend but i don’t want him to think that i’m unsatisfied with him or something, i feel like i should say something because i’ve been having s_!c!dal ideations kinda? like whenever i do something wrong i immediately feel like taking my life is a good solution/option.. but i don’t want to die.. i just want it to stop so i can be normal and okay, at least just as a mask so that i’m able to deal with it myself behind closed doors. i know i should probably say something to my healthcare professionals but i don’t want the mention of hospitalization to pop up since it’s awful here and does more harm than good. i don’t have anyone that shares the same diagnoses with me that is actually rational and logical. so i have no one i can personally ask. i’m sorry if none of what i typed makes sense maybe but i seriously need someone to talk to that understands

I'm sure I'll try to commit but it won't work because im afraid of pain. the hospital isn't a good option since we can't afford anything like that. I also think im on the brink of psychosis, but I can't really tell. The lines are so blurred, this just feels like everyday life atp.

6,Hallucinating and need help. ,I’m currently in an episode and extremely desperate for help or suggestions on where to find help for free or low income. I am under lot of stress and have been diagnosed BPD+Bipolar 2 which was later adjusted to schizoaffective. I did not agree with that diagnosis because I don’t always hallucinate. I actually rarely do. And I’ve always thought that if you can recognize something’s not real then it’s not delusional. Well I’m on the phone with my boyfriend after a long stressful day. I worked myself up into thinking he went to a strip club. I can’t even explain to you how I did that. Now we are on the phone and he fell asleep. Well I can’t hang up because I keep thinking I hear a woman in the background. When I listen close it sounds like a woman saying “come here baby” “let me help you relax” “I hate you(my name)”. When I heard I hate you I impulsively started getting dressed to go to the hospital to admit myself. Then realized I lost my insurance 2 months ago and I haven’t dealt with this since before that. I am scared and anxious and lonely. Desperate for advice. ,1710646865.0,False,3,10,Far_Support_7371,None,1bgo7uc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bgo7uc/hallucinating_and_need_help/

8,so empty all the time,"i think i might have bpd. the horrible mood swings, the self destructive behavior, the fear of abandonment and the feeling of emptiness have been matching up with what i've been like for as long as i can remember. i don't have acess to any proper mental health care or resources where i live and i've been planning on moving out in the next 1 or 2 years (not moving just for that but it's one of many reasons)

the thing is, the hollow feeling inside me has only gotten worse with time. nothing's ever enough, no one's ever enough. i can't keep up w this emptiness that keeps sucking my soul out for so long, i've already resorted to not so good coping mechanisms to try and keep it under control but i honestly don't want to end up in the hospital for something stupid. i don't want to ruin all my progress after i made it this far. does anyone know how to cope w the emptiness? just need someone to talk to about this since it resurfaced again",1712882983.0,False,6,4,dry-rain-water,None,1c1vpp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1c1vpp7/so_empty_all_the_time/

10,I subconsciously forgive the people who have hurt me ,"I think this is mostly because my memory has gone to shit. But i don’t hold grudges, i can’t hold grudges even if i wanted to. My parents for example, the biggest thing my parents have done to hurt me is lie to me about my biological dad, created a whole fake scrapbook to keep up with the lies, with false dates and names. I would not have found out the truth if The biological father (who i don’t have in my life because i chose not to) hadn’t found me and told me the truth himself. My parents made this all about them, my mom made excuses for herself and my dad felt betrayed and ignored me for weeks when the truth came out, he expected an apology from me. I never had a good relationship with my dad, i thought i hated him he was always angry at everyone, he was verbally abusive and strict af, i couldnt breathe around him. My mom stopped defending me because he would just yell at her and then she would yell at me saying she would never defend me again. Every terrible argument i had with my parents ended with me telling myself “remember this feeling remember how hurt you are-remember their words dont forgive them for this” But i always forgive even without an apology. I moved out almost 2 years ago and i feel safer, im not used to arguing and being yelled at anymore, but now ive become more sensitive to everything, i still see my parents from time to time and when they yell or bicker with me in the slightest i cry and i kind of start to tweak out. They look at me like im crazy and tell me i dont know how to handle discipline i dont need to cry over everything. I dont want to fucking cry but i cant help it and knowing that im making a fool of myself just bawling my eyes out makes me more angry with myself and my reaction to things. My mom has put me in mental hospitals just because she didnt know what to do with me anymore. After my first and only attempt to take my life she became reliant on mental hospitals to just take me away whenever things got bad. And that brought more trauma, so mucb happened to me in those places and she swore it was meant to help me. Then i was in a residential treatment center for 2 months, i had to live there, i didnt see the outside world at all. Thats when i got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and thats when i started to hate myself more. 
Theres so much i could say this isnt even half, now all i will ever be is my trauma its made me into such a complex person and i cant deal with myself anymore. I dont feel a strong love for my parents, i could move to a city far away and never talk to my entire family ever again and i would be fine, except my little siblings ofc id miss them. No matter what i can forgive my parents which is without saying because they’re all i have. But even past boyfriends , past friends who have destroyed me i can still talk to them because i dont remember the hurt i felt only the action, and i do forget sometimes, so people take advantage of that, the people in my life know that they can walk all over me and i wont hold it against them for too long.

11,Is it necessary to take medication on every episode?,"Hey, I was diagnosed around 1 year ago and there are a lot of things that my family does in my crisis moments that just feels like it's making things worse.
Like if idk something has triggered me so bad that I start crying or hyperventilating and my mum will force me to take strong medication to fall asleep for hours, but the way that she doesn't even help me, try to calm me or talk to me and just forces me to drug myself and threaten to send me to a hospital if i deny the medication just really makes me even more anxious.
I don't know if it's necessary to get to that point so soon instead of waiting and talking to me.
I really try to explain it to my mother so she can help me and we can understand it better but it just confuses me so much because I don't know any other bpd my age or even in my town and I really need some help understanding all of this, there are still a lot of things that I don't understand about myself or my condition but this is my main concern right now.
Do all BPD anxious episodes need to be managed through medication? Because it really gets me more anxious ...

15,(TW) Bpd x bpd relationship. Advice?,"Hi. I never use reddit and just made this account like 10 mins ago so please excuse if I'm not really doing this right. And sorry for the length I've added a ""TLDR"" at the end (is that how you do it?)
TW Substance abuse, Institutions, Suicidal Ideation, Psychosis, Police Brutality, Eating Disorders (possible other tw I forgot to mention)
I am F20 dating someone with bpd M24. We have known each other a year now (started relationship April 2023 then both didnt talk for 3 months May 2023-Sep 2023 because we both went to rehab in different places) and honestly the way we met kinda.. will raise some red flags for some people but honestly I am not looking for anyone to comment on that aspect. We met in a psych ward in April 2023. Both at super low points. I was in a severe manic/psychotic episode as I also struggle with bipolar disorder. I had stayed up for 4 nights straight and maybe eaten 2 meals during that time. When I got there I weighed under 100 pounds. I was having delusions and convinced myself I had alters. I had no idea that the guy I was with was giving me weed that was laced with benzos. He also had laid hands on me and cheated during the relationship as well. I didnt even find out I tested positive for the benzos until a while later. The psychward I went to was absolutaly disgusting and also didn't tell me I had very abnormal blood levels and forced psych meds down my throat. I don't even think it was the right time to start those meds with my weight and health issues and substances in my body. It was pretty much medical abuse. And it was my second ever time, besides when I was 16, going to a mental hospital. My boyfriend, on the other hand, was considered a ""frequent flyer."" He struggled with lots of substance abuse and suicidal thoughts. I would find out later that he admitted himself this time because he was feeling awful about not having his old FP. When I first saw him, he mentioned having BPD in a group therapy and explaining how it was affecting him. My ears perked up listening to him. He was just a great talker, vulnerable, and accountable for himself. I don't remember a lot from when we first met because of all the different things going on with my brain, but I talked to him by passing him a note (I think the note may have been about the staff at the psych ward.) We both began talking the whole time we were there after that. There was absolutely no activities, the staff treated us like utter garbage, and we both were too restless to just sit around all day. We would talk ""walks"" down the hallways just talking. About everything. There was so much chemistry. He somehow knew how exactly to calm me down. We both knew how to make eachother laugh. He was optimistic, despite how awful different circumstances he had were. Way more optimistic than me. He pointed out a big photo on the wall of a colorful wave and said to pretend we were taking a walk on the beach together.  We also did have one activity room we would go in maybe once out of the whole week that had a piano and some playing cards. I played Heart and Soul as a duet with him. We somehow made that awful situation we were in into something enjoyable. As days passed, he started opening up about how he had a charge of battery on an officer. Basically, he was in the same mental hospital we were in at the time, and he was having an episode. He is a black man with tattoos, so everyone just treated him as if he was dangerous and aggressive before he even got to any point like that. I don't know exactly what happened, but they didn't attempt to deescalate at all. A police officer came over to slam him against the wall and tell him ""you'd be better off dead."" He then spit in the officers direction. And that's it. He didn't hit him or attempt to hit him.  Because of covid, that action he took is considered battery against a police officer, and he was looking at a minimum of 10 years in prison for it. The case is still ongoing as we speak. He's doing a mental health diversion to get the felony off his record, and he's trying to get the case dropped. If the case is dropped, he plans to sue. So basically, everything has been extremely stressful for both of us the entire time we have known each other. But we connect so well. I have never felt so much love and passion for someone. After the mental hospital, we hung out for weeks. We did smoke a lot of weed together and both of us started getting worse mentally. I got sent to psych 2 more times after the first time and then got transferred to residential on the 3rd time. The 3rd time I went was because I went to his house, had severe psychosis, and he had to call the police on me. We weren't really together for quite a few months and I even broke off talking to him because I needed to recover. Then, I reached out again in September. We both relapsed, and I would see him once a week so my use was weekly and his was daily. He lives with his mother who has a medical card and gives him free weed. Now, we both are over 2 weeks sober and plan to stay that way. But the relationship had gotten tense and strained. We don't use escapism for our feelings anymore. We even quit nicotine. We started eating healthy, exercising, and finding ourselves. But it's so hard. I know people say two sick people can't get better together, but I just want to prove them wrong. I want us to be healthy. So many things make us insecure. We are both terrified of losing each other. We both want to get out of our triggering households together. But we both struggle with things. I'm going back to regular talk therapy and he's about to start his therapy too. I even want to do couples therapy. But money is a huge issue. He couldn't work for the entire time we have been together. I've only had a part-time retail job that pays 13 an hour. He's been mad that I'm working way more and seeing him less. I'm trying to explain that I'm doing this for us. It hurts him because he wants to be a caretaker and he wants to be the breadwinner. But realistically, I'm the one who can work rn. And I'm even struggling with that as well because I got in a car accident in an Uber and my back is messed up. The pain is making me constantly irritated. Please. I know a lot of people might say this doesn't seem like it's possible it could work, but I want some optimism. Me and him both want it to work and are willing to do anything we possibly can to make it work. Any advice is so appreciated. Thank you.

16,Sponsors?,"Hello, I have just started a partial hospitalization program and am taking my recovery from BPD more seriously. A friend, who is in 12 step, recommended I find someone like a sponsor for my journey and I think this is a great idea.

The biggest difficulty for me is that I do not have a space to meet potential sponsors. As with most PHP groups, we are not allowed to contact each other outside of group until we're both discharged. So, I have come to reddit. I was thinking perhaps this could be a thread to match each other, if we feel comfortable.

If you think you'd be a good match for me feel free to send a DM. If you don't think so, that's okay, and  I welcome you to post what you're looking for!

For myself, I live in Seattle and would love to find someone local. I understand we're currently all at home for COVID, so I am happy to start virtually but I'd love to find someone who I could perhaps get coffee with sometimes, but this is not required. It is very important to me to find someone who is also professionally diagnosed and in treatment, especially if you are doing or have ever done PHP or IOP. At this point, I'd say my BPD is moderately managed and I am looking for support with someone who is also somewhat managed. My goal is remission, I hope yours is too!

Because this is a possible tigger I want to say that I am active in ageplay. If you are triggered by ageplay, dd/lg type dynamics, I will probably not be a good fit for you.",1586276492.0,False,5,1,xoxoaspey,None,fwne8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/fwne8a/sponsors/
17,No where to turn,"
No one needs to comment or read. I don't know where to type or go. 

My SO of 6 years told me to turn to reddit to ""vent"" instead of SM or friends. So I did. He wasn't happy with that. I have therapy 1 hour once a week. No one really knows how dark my mind is, even when I was ""venting"" in general.  We both have bad trust issues, we came out of bad marriages, we have done things to each other we regret. 
He's been reading things online and books that he knows are bad, but is sure I'm a typical BPD horrible person now. At first he didnt , i thought he knew better. We feel 10x more than neurotypical people, so sure, we react different than them.
This past month+  has been more than horrible. My dad passed when we weren't really expecting it (my mom passed in 2017 as well, that was truly unexpected). His dad passed in October which is bringing up emotions from that. He confessed something about 1.5 weeks ago and I'm trying to process that as well and I feel shattered from that too. I have a lot of emotions going on. It's like he thinks I should be over everything by now and be just fine. I'm TRYING to hold it together and I can't. I'm lucky to be alive if we're being honest. My depression is at an all time high, I'm anxiety predominant so this is odd for me. Yes. I've seen psych 2 weeks in a row emergent and will next week again for my regular visit which will male 3 weeks in a row (not including therapy.) 

It's constant tit-for-tat. Who can get who worse. He's no better than me but he seems to think he is bc he doesn't have the horrible bpd diagnosis.
 
At the same time there's so much good found in him and we can be amazing together. When it's good, it's great. He's the best to my kids. He treats me like a princess. He saw my dad the day before he went into the hospital when he went to get stuff from my brother and dad and dad and my SO talked abt marriage. He spent time at the hospital with him when I couldn't. He was with us when he took his last breath. It means so much to me. I cannot imagine life without him. 
My chest has been hurting since he made his confession. Not normal costochondritis muscle pain. I can't take another heartbreak. My marriage wasn't a heartbreak, that was a good riddance. This. I won't survive. I already feel it. 

With his dad, i helped make his transition as easy as i could on his family even it was just by being there (it was a long, heartbreaking decline.) I was strong for him until his dads funeral. My dad wasn't the best (I reminded him too much of my mom, so our relationship was strained, and other factors including his lady friend til they broke up) so his dad was a great father figure to me. I cherished every moment with his dad even more. 

 No relationship is flawless. I saw my parents go thru hell and swore they were going to divorce but they got thru whatever it was. We know we love eachother. 

He just started iop this week on his own and honestly I'm nervous bc I've been inpatient 7 times, in IOP for a while. I hear how they talk about bpd and know they're going to tell him to leave me fast especially when he tells them what's going on. I'm sure he's going to not tell them what he's done. It's human nature to save face. WHY is the person with bpd acting so erratic? There's a reason. 
He needs therapy for sure. Group therapy is just nerve wrecking with his situation overall (I don't want to tell all of his business.)

We're going to start couples therapy as well, if he still wants to do it. It would be nice if my therapist did couples but gotta be married. Idk when we can do it btwn everything going on. 

I wish I didn't feel. I wish I didn't care. 

I'm terrified. I can't leave my kids. I already tried once and nearly succeeded.

All of a sudden last week I had a little episode where I was crying, I haven’t heard from him since. I reached out over text and told him I’m going through a hard time and I would really appreciate his support (he knows I have bpd and that I was in the hospital in September after an attempt). That was Tuesday he never texted me back, I was being so vulnerable asking for support (I’ve never asked him for anything not to go on a date, no favors) that was the first thing I asked for him.

19,"Dating Among BPD, The End....","[Prev Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/s/GH7IUvIApk)


So i started dating someone with BPD, me also being diagnosed with BPD.

How it started : we longed for each other, we understood each other. Felt like we were made for eachother.

How it was : her trauma dumping on me and being the therapist for her after she promising me she won't abandon me and this is gonna last. I did promise the same thing.

How it ended : i got latched on to her, she was my FP, she splitted, i begged her to stay, she just abandoned me......

The confrontation and the explanation of my emotions during the end: the tail end of explanation to a messy short lived love story.

----‐-------------

I couldn't understand that she was having a splitting episode, cuz i couldn't understand what was going on.... i loved her too much that i made her my FP, and when she split on me, it made me really miserable. I used to go in and out of panic attacks, some lasting for about hours to recover back and get back to working. Lasted till yesterday, untill i figured out what happened, and explored those emotions.

So what i feel like happened :  I had a traumatizing event when i went out for drunk, the friend i went with got bruises and concussions and was hospitalized, i was in shock, cuz i was the one who saw the whole thing and took him to the hospital. She wanted my attention even though i told her i was in shock, i gave it to her, supported her even though i was in shock, i wanted an distraction at the moment, i told her my traumatized event, she just moved away from the conversation. After a while she splitted on me saying i wasn't attentive enough. Did not know what was happening. I went with it. Tried being supportive didn't work. I begged her to stay and not abandon me, as i was fucking miserable. I tried to reconcile, cuz i accepted her as a FP, after a long time. Nah, she didn't want me anymore, i thought she would understand me and stuff, nah she just wanted to use me and make me feel like shit. To be noted, i was hesitant in the relationship. She is the one who convinced me to be in the relationship. My abandonment issues are at its max now.

So after everything i saw a post on my recommendation, where i saw someone splitting on thier loved ones, the fucking texts were literally the same. Damn i felt scammed.........

So after figuring out my emotions , and realising this was already over, i confronted her. She was still hostile towards me. When i told her she had splitted and alsked her to read upon some resources, she fucking told me, if she started reading upon BPD, she is gonna become more of a BPD person.

WTF!!!!!

Damn, that was the final red flag i needed, i actually thought she was working on herself and stuff, she then started accusing me of having BPD and how the hell would i be able to help her. This was a moment of enlightenment,  damn, i became so fucking happy and void of feelings for her, after being so miserable for a while. I did have a feeling that i was the one who pushed her away and i was the reason for abandonment, i kinda felt different after . Nah, she was the biggest redflag i had ever dated.

The happy part is this made me understand, the difference between the people who try to be better and the one's who use narcissism to deal with their issue.i have splitted with my partners, but not like this, never hurt them. If ur in this sub, its most likely that u r dealing with ur issues, and not being a narcissistic ass. This makes u a good person.

21,How to process guilt (sfw) (trigger warning)(seeking advice),"Trigger warning: DV 
**************



I (24f) have been struggling with bpd since I was in high school. I restarted seeing a therapist in august of last year after I got out of the hospital and was put on meds. I still struggle a lot with lashing out in anger which is what this post is about. Last night I got really angry with my boyfriend. It was over something really stupid. It’s no excuse but he was pushing my buttons so bad and I laid my hands on him. At first I didn’t mean to hurt him and then I realized I was getting way too rough. Today I feel like shit. He’s obviously really mad at me because I hurt him but I want him to forgive me. I understand he needs to process but the guilt is overwhelming me. I’ve begged for forgiveness over and over and he won’t say he accepts it. We can’t even look at each other. Does anyone have any advice for processing guilt when you’ve done something wrong? How do you come to terms that they’re not ready to forgive you yet? Is there anything I can do to right the situation? 

My meds were changed a few days ago so I don’t know if the increased anger could be a side affect.

I had a flash back the other night from when I was raped (which is really hard to put that word down, it happened 3 years or so ago and I still can't say it out loud) and I've been extremely out of it since. Dissociating, severe mood swings, suicidal thoughts, the whole shebang.

","I know this post is very long but please take the time to read, I really need ur opinions and help on this one🥺🙏🙏

I (20f) and my partner (26m) have been waiting to get married for 6months now, we have been together for 4 years now, engaged for 1. I struggle with bpd but we found this out during the relationship. During our whole relationship it has been rough, when I met him I was very young and had just came out of a very abusive relationship (when I say just it was probably nearly a year later) and was still recovering, he knew this and we made it work anyway. It was great for a while, I started really feeling better with my mental health. Then I got assaulted by one of his friends. ( It's a long story but I won't get into it now) Obviously my mental health degraded after that and I was in and out of hospital and that is when they figured out I had bpd. It was a horrible time in my life and to me felt like forever. Right when all of this was happening COVID hit, my bf lost his house bc his roommates left unexpectedly bc of COVID and he couldn't afford it anymore. So I was still living with my parents at the time and I was SOOO ill that my parents agreed to my bf moving in with us as he was helping so much with my mental health. The plan was always to leave and move in with eachother but life sucks as you all may know. We saved enough money to leave together and work on the other side of world with his dad, we were there for 3 months but to put it short his dad fucked us over and then Brexit happened ( I'm British) so I was not allowed to work basically anywhere and had to leave. So we came back to my parents and decided to get married as we had previously been engaged for a year anyway so we could build the life together that we wanted. So that would have been 6 months since we came back and decided to do all of this, I spent a lot of money on paperwork and got very stressed about it. In this period of time our relationship was under a lot of stress and pressure and let's just say that my bf ""cracked"", I am very patient with him given how patient he was with me and how much he helped me with everything, but I can only put up with so much. He has been shouting at me and calling me names every day for maybe 8 months. So eventually we got to a point where we could finally get married and go away together but because of his behaviour I am not well enough to go now, I had to quit my job due to panic attacks coming back. Had a trip to the hospital and now back on meds and I am physically ill from my anxiety (vomiting, nauseous, not sleeping) We had a very long chat and for obvious reasons have cancelled the marriage because I am not well enough to leave yet and because of how toxic everything has become, he says that he behaved this way because of stress and is very sorry about the whole situation. He wants to stay here for a few months (I don't know how comfortable I am with that) and save up money so that he can leave on his own ( he hadn't been working since we came back which really bugs me) and I have to stay with my parents where they can look after me and I can get the help I need with the psychologist bc where we want to go I will have no insurance or right to it and I NEED it right now. His plan is to work and study at the same time while he is there and then go to uni and after uni come and get me. Which to me seems like a silly plan, I can make a year work but not 4 years. Also I feel like after everything happened it's not really the same anymore between us (I really do love him but it's all a bit too much) I just feel a bit in shock with all of this bc it all happened very fast and suddenly I am now trying to figure out my life. I am 20 with very little work experience and little to no education (I am very intelligent but could not do these things due to panic disorder) I have 0 friends, I only have my mum and dad and we have very little money. I want to move away but it seems nearly impossible on my own and I just feel a bit defeated by this whole situation. Obviously I think being on my own and focusing on my mental health and getting a job that works for me would be the best thing for me rn, but obviously bc of my bpd I am terrified of being alone and it's already hard as it is bc I have no social life apart from him and it been like that for so long that I don't really know where to start. I just don't really know what to do in this situation, he seems to think that if he leaves and does all of this he can make it work between us, but I am not so sure.

25,Is it so easy to forget the past?,"Lately I have been going through some severe depressive episodes and people with who I have talked always say that past is in the past, you cannot change it, you need to leave everything behind as if these things never happened and move on in your life, you should be happy that you have a fully functional body, many are not even lucky to have that, so just leave it all, do things , focus on other things. 
The guy whom I like always gets mad at me whenever I try to explain why I SH or I am suicida l. He angrily shouts for me to shut up and that he doesn't want to hear my bullshit. Recently I went to visit I went to a far away place just to visit some churches but out of nowhere I ended up doing SH and I went to hospital and cops were called but all things were sorted out because the injuries were superficial only. One of the cop asked me why I did this, I told him because of depression, then he asks me how did you get depression and I was speechless. 
And this guy I like, yesterday he was shouting on call like anything, saying that if I had done something, his number will be the first on my call list and how he will ended up getting blamed. And whenever I start to say something he threatens me  by saying that he will disconnect the call and he will block me. He means a lot to me, so I end up saying nothing. 
I agree with the fact that past can't be changed but doesn't that mean I or anyone can just leave behind years of suffering from the past as if it never happened.

He told me he was proud i didnt get angry and that it makes him want to do better, i told him i didnt know if i could keep being calm if this happens every single day. Today he does the same thing again and i got angry and cursed at him but i didnt throw a rage fit.

He lied to me for months and i forgave him. He ridiculed me and made me look crazy after it too and i forgave him. He breaks up with me and then comes back begging me to help him not kill himself right after he ignored me purposefully and caused a huge breakdown where i relapsed and almost got sent to a hospital.

27,"Help me please, I don't know if I should've said all of this in an email.","Below this next paragraph is a letter I wrote to a psychologist office, as I am actively seeking treatment for a personality disorder(/s?)

I will preface this by saying that I am in no way trying to offend anyone in this group. I know I am not diagnosed, but I am almost 100% certain that this is what I'm living with. I haven't been to a doctor since I was a child - let alone a specialized one - besides involuntary suicide-watch nights at my local hospital and the occasional urgent care for the flu. So it is safe to say I have no idea what I'm doing. 

I would really appreciate your guys' thoughts on this email that took me an hour and a half to write because I got sidetracked.

--‐-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not really sure how to come out and say this, but here I am. I believe I have BPD +ADHD. I hope you're not offended by my self-diagnosing. I can assure you that I am not saying these things because I *want* to have these personality disorders. I have lived without doctor interference for my entire life, but I can't continue to do that, so I started looking into my symptoms and what they might present. 

Upon extensive research, I display most of the symptoms in the DSM 5. At first I believed it might be CPTSd, but I more resemble BPD+ADHD. This has caused my relationships with employers, family, and friends to plummet. It has been severely impacting my life and I need help before it's too late. It's taken me a few years to seek help because I thought that it would buffer itself out - but it hasn't. 

I have had an extremely traumatic life, beginning as a child and ongoing to today.
I feel like it would be a huge burden to unload all of my trauma on somebody - and I don't want to re-live any of the trauma myself - so this has caused me to stay dormant and struggle by myself. 

I understand that I need to get an actual psychological evaluation and I am in no way trying to negate that fact. I know I am no professional. I am just stating what I believe is true so that I can find somebody qualified to help me. 

The best way to reach me is through E-mail or a scheduled phone call. 

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this, and I hope that together, we can figure this thing out so I can function like a somewhat normal human being.

28,I left my fp behind,"Hello everyone!
first of all I'm sorry for my grammar and poor vocabulary since english isn't my first language (but I'm trying my best)

So I recently moved out of a rehab in which I lived for 2 years. It wasn't like a hospital, more like a home for disabled adults. Every client (like me) had a person to talk to, like a social worker or a therapist. And over the 2 years my person (x) became my favorite person. They helped me through a lot and I don't think I would've accomplished half of the things I did without them. x was my support and my shoulder to cry on. They were by my side on my healing journey and made a huge difference in my daily life.

I moved into my new apartment a month ago and I'm kinda proud and happy with where my life is going rn

But there is one thing that has been so hard and overwhelming that I can't even share it with my loved ones. I left my fp behind. It's not that my loved ones (like family, bestie and boyfriend) don't know about this, but I'm afraid to share how much it actually hurts. I've been looking forward to my ""new life"" for so long and I really didn't think that the first time would be easy but i never would've expected it to be THAT hard. 

When I'm alone in my apartment, I'm crying all the time. I'm hurting. I miss x so much and I just want to talk to them. I want them to reassure me that everything will be alright. I don't want this reassurance from my loved ones. And I don't wanna have to pretend like it would change anything. Because it wouldn't. 

The worst part is that my boyfriend still lives in that rehab and gets to speak to x like 5 days a week. Except for the weekends when he stays at my place. 

Also x has called me like 1 or 2 times since I moved out and someday he wants to visit me and have a coffee. 

I don't really know what kind of support I'm looking for, I don't really know what to do, I don't really know what else to say, I just don't know anymore

29,Depressed and feeling lost,"I was diagnosed with BPD in July. I also started dating this girl who has BPD, depression, anxiety, PTSD, and schizoaffective disorder. Recently she went to the hospital and is getting help for her voices and hallucinations. She's been admitted to multiple hospitals multiple times over the last few years. I broke up with her while she's there and she comes home tomorrow. She really wants to get back together but everyone keeps telling me she's abusive and manipulative and is trying to tell me what I want to here, bring emotionally manipulative, to get me back. 

I need an unbiased opinion.

So she has cheated on me, claiming she didn't know it was cheating (I slept with someone while she was in a hospital in August while we were on a break and she says it's still cheating). She also was talking to men at one point in a sexual manner because she wanted the attention and wasn't 100% sure she was gay. She started that before we were officially dating. We dated for about 7 months. She is a party animal that copes with stress by drinking and I'm not really much for partying any more. Bad decisions are her forte because that's what she's known for the past few years and I've done everything I can to help her. My therapist says I act more as a parental figure than a girlfriend to her, which I've been working on changing myself.

But she didn’t tell me that, and she agreed to come? I then said okay I will drive you back home in the morning so I’ll rest early. Then I found out she left at 4:30am to go catch a flight home, after she had just yelled at me about not wanting to catch a flight. When I woke up, she messaged me asking to pay back for the hotel because she didn’t have any money to help her boyfriend in the hospital, and I switched. I said “Why did you leave and not even say anything to me and then just ask me for money? That I don’t even owe you? You said you were covering everything, I said thank you for everything, I will repay you by getting us massages and pedicures, etc.”
 She then said I didn’t even say thank you when we checked in and how I’m a shit friend, now she knows why I have no friends because of how I treat them. But honestly I have been so stressed lately, my husband and I were recently in a dangerous situation and so was my friend but the whole entire trip that’s what she was talking about. I asked her if she could leave it until we go back home as the reason why I was going on a road trip was to destress. My husband ended up meeting us on the trip, and I splitted on him in front of her which I feel terrible about. But now she’s put that against me, and also said I treated and talked to her like shit which I don’t remember but I also wouldn’t know if I did or not and that’s what I hate… I don’t know how to explain all of this to her I feel really guilty but I also know I felt so disrespected by her and she already knows I’m going through a tough time. But I can see from her shoes that she is too.

33,I can’t afford DBT and I don’t know what to do.,"Hi all,

Hope you’re doing as well as you can today. Remember your best IS good enough.

Long rant to begin with?

I got diagnosed with BPD in November 2023. I was lucky and able to access three months of outpatient treatment through the public hospital. (In Australia for context).

I am middle aged. I have the BPD trait of impulse spending. I wised up to building “wealth” and had a small bit of savings after working on saving for 18 months. I have never owned property, always rented and now my minimum wage doesn’t cover rent (and I’m gracefully living with my elderly / ill father. I don’t know how long he’s got.)

I quit my job (3 weeks before BPD diagnosis) because of my abusive boss and his horrible daughter. They both made my life hell, I was working 12-14 hour days. He threatened all employees (not just me) but the threat of “we’re going to put you in a PIP and terminate you” was too much to bear. I am the extreme of sensitive and cry at the drop of a hat. It’s crap. It had some savings behind me, however, I was unemployed for months and they soon disappeared.

I was bullied as a kid for being poor. I was bullied in high school for being socially awkward / different / gay. I’ve never had a lot of “true” friends, and without my dad, i don’t really have someone to reach out to.

I used to be conventionally attractive and rather healthy in my teens. When I finished high school, I lost my first serious relationship where my BPD symptoms were all over the place. My fault 100%. I sometimes go back and write to apologise to them, but choose not to. It brings up too much.

In university I made many friends and for a good 10 or so years we connected, they were accepting of my quirks, life was ok.

Then COVID happened.

(We know how that panned out. Still panning out.)

I also lost friends because of different life paths and how that stuff goes. No one did any wrong, we just drifted apart.

Then when things got back to some sort of “normal”; I joined a queer affirming church (religion does play a part in my heart, however, I do not condone abuse, murder, exclusion, and extortion in the name of Religion.)

I’ve made some friends there. They all live rather far away and I haven’t been to church since my diagnosis.

I also got a new job in March and I am enjoying it. There are a few downsides, yet only one that irks me.

There is a woman I work with. She is approximately 10 years younger than me. She is one of those “sickly sweet types” (100% me issue, not her issue. I know this.)

So far she has stated:
- Her fiancé has bought her a 170,000 car
- She controls all finances and her fiancés money is put into her account. 
- She had her braces, current car, and all overseas travel paid for by her brother.
- She is about to marry a man who is about to inherit millions of dollars.

She’s definitely a bit of a BS artist; I think we all can be, as life is tough. However, ever since her arrival my BPD has flared up. I am poor. Always have been, always will be if I don’t change my life.

As DBT costs 21,000 AUD + and is often ran during the day (when I’m at work); I cannot access it. 

My executive disfunction is rife too.

I am not close to my siblings as they are generations older and have their own lives. My extended family isn’t close either; my mum was an only child and dad avoided his family due to trauma. I don’t have many friends and I can guarantee I am sh*t at being a friend.

I am so lonely, facing tough times because Australia is only for the rich; and I can’t move countries to try something different. I only work in admin and I suck at crafts (but enjoy them). I enjoy reading too.

If you’ve made it this far, you’re amazing! Thank you for reading my ranting.

My question is: where do I start? I’m terrified of everything and spend every day suffering from s******l idealisation multiple times a day. I’m sick of feeling this way and know I could try and make a better life, so why can’t I?",1715481572.0,False,5,8,TiredSleepyGrumpy,None,1cpxs35,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1cpxs35/i_cant_afford_dbt_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/
34,Last night I almost :/ ended things TW: SI and SU,"Backstory: I’ve been dealing with the thoughts my whole life, had a couple attempts and ended up in the mental hospital more than I want to count. Was diagnosed bipolar but new that wasn’t me so I continued life not knowing what really is up. A couple months ago I met with a online doctor she diagnosed me with BPD and said that she couldn’t treat me or give me meds bc of the state my SI thoughts are in. Every single day and I cannot help it. So I’ve been struggling alone and no one seems to care. I’ve been drinking way to much this past year, about a 750 ml every 3 days. I go to bed sick and pass out. 

Currently, last night: what triggered the thoughts was a phone call with a close family member. The call went fine and the person didn’t do anything wrong but I couldn’t stop thinking about how terrible I am, how I talk to much, how embarrassing I am, how no one can stand me, my own husband ect and I’m so tired of making a fool out of myself. I’m tired of existing and failing. After dinner I asked my husband to take my son with him and get us some ice cream, I wanted to be alone.. you get the point. I know it sounds pathetic but I thought that was my only chance and if I didn’t do it then I would keep suffering and things have not ever got better, I don’t want to live in pain anymore.

TW: idk if I’m allowed to talk about the details this is my first post on here. But here it goes- I grabbed my husbands hand *** and loaded it. Finished up my note that’s been sitting in my phone for a while and put it up to my head. I then got scared and couldn’t do it. Thinking of SI is one thing (sounds easy enough, sounds like a release) but in the actual moment I was actually scared of the pain. Finally I heard my husband pull back up the house so I quickly put everything back up. I went out like everything was normal and he went to where the stuff was and said “WHY WERE YOU MESSING WITH MY STUFF” I said I wasn’t and he called me a child and said “wow now I can’t even keep these in the house” he unloaded them all. I he kept verbally harassing me. I put my son to bed and slept in our guest room and he hasn’t talked to me since. 

Now I feel so embarrassed and alone. He makes me feel pathetic. I know I am. I’m barely hanging on and no one seems to care. I have told my mother and close people how bad it is and they said “sorry maybe you should get on meds “ I’ve been on soo many different types of meds my whole life and it was a nightmare, felt like I was living in a shell. 

Anyways, I guess I needed to let it out. Maybe talk to someone who is going through the same.",1700236522.0,False,5,3,ZealousidealLet4898,None,17xi547,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/17xi547/last_night_i_almost_ended_things_tw_si_and_su/
35,Bpd - advice / help,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this but just looking for some advice, I’m diagnosed with bpd. I’ve always known I am impulsive and self disruptive, but I’ve only just kind of noticed after thinking something like how bad it is, and I’m just wondering is this part of bpd and do other people experience this and how can it be changed. So for example today, I didn’t sleep all night was doing cocaine till about 1pm today about 5pm I said to myself and meant it genuinely, felt like I really was serious for once, said I’ve had enough of doing this, and it’s selfish and I’m bored of it and had enough of repeating this cycle & that I’m not going down this route, because I know what’s happened in the past when I’ve abused drugs to much. I even said to my friends that I do drugs with, I was going to distance myself from them & obviously I have said this to myself before, but I like felt really serious this time. Bearing in mind I still haven’t slept, without even realising to myself what I said earlier I go and get more on tick when I’m skint and have an early morning hospital appointment, so deep down I know it’s a bad idea but just don’t even think about the consequences, even though my normal self is the biggest stress head and overthinker, but for some reason when I do these self disruptive things, I somehow just don’t care almost and just think will be fine. And I went ahead got drugs, eventually started to feel the regret flowing in, then quickly realised the conversation I had earlier, and literally felt baffled, because I didn’t know I was so kind of out of control with my own head, that I can go from being stressed and feeling terrible n hating myself n think I’m really fed up and done with this, to literally just reckless. I’m just wondering is this normal with bpd and i’ve just never really noticed it before and if so, is there anyway to control yourself when you go into the self disrupt careless mindset, like how do you get your normal self back that thinks logically, because I can see this is like one massive problem in my life, and in the past that mindset got me to a point I was an alcoholic, doing cocaine whenever I got the chance and on a rehab list and eventually jumped off a bridge, because of hating myself so much n rhen doing it over again, then feeling terrible later on. I never really realised how much of a problem this is until now . I also know this could be part of addiction, but i’ve also done things like self harm, and drank bleach when not thinking straight.",1696393572.0,False,2,2,whatevertfu,None,16zdm4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/16zdm4k/bpd_advice_help/
36,Success and Struggles,"I really just needed to talk about things with others that may be able to relate.

Some BG:

So, I've had mental health issues as long as I can really remember. I was in and out of psych hospitals and treatment from my mid-teens until present (now almost 36). I am diagnosed with both MDD and BPD, and while things have improved a lot since I was younger, things are still a struggle a lot of the time. I'm learning that I'll never really react to the world as someone who's more 'neurotypical', and that's okay. I instead need to learn how to be more effective in managing how I deal with the ways I experience my world. I hope that makes sense.

Anyway, I have not been able to work for a long time now. I have a huge issue with being able to consistently get up and out of bed and in to work. After enough of that, well you get fired. And after losing enough jobs, you just kinda say it's not for you. :/

Well, after years  of not working outside the home, I had my first day of sorta work yesterday. I say sorta cus it's more of a side gig type thing my husband got me at his job. I'll go in on Saturdays, with my husband, and help out.

It was nerve wracking. It keyed me up for hours before and after. (I didn't sleep Friday, went in to work Sat, got home Saturday night and slept for like 4 hours, and now I'm awake again. FML) I had to be around people I only sort of know, and I don't really leave the house, like at all. I was scared of screwing up, and looking incompetent, and reflecting badly on my husband. I was afraid of talking to much (which I do when I'm nervous) I'm still not sure if everyone liked me or was faking it.

But, I did it. I fucking did it. And I'm (mostly) okay.",1630252030.0,False,3,1,this_is_lilmiss_kris,None,pdxoc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/pdxoc2/success_and_struggles/

I can barely stand to go to work because of all the triggers causing panic attacks.  When I'm home all I can think about is the best way to end everything.  My wife is so busy with her personal stuff that I really can't talk to her.  When I do she turns into a total bitch.  I go to every thereopy sessions, do my journal, follow my breathing techniques, and follow my meds to a tee.  

I feel like I'm getting nowhere and more and wore out.  I think more about how I can get legally high with OTC so I can a few minutes of joy.  Or where  I can comfortably open my wrists and feel the life leave me and float to sleep.  

I don't want to go back to the hospital because the nurses refused to give me the medications I needed to survive. I have physical conditions outside BPD but they treated me like shit until I filed a complaint.  Oddly enough they sent me home the next day.

38,Venting. Needing support. I am not sure...,"Hi friends. 

I am having a very difficult time right now. I am homeless and while I work on getting housing, I am currently overly staying my welcome at a friends house. 

The shelters are full and even if they have space they repeatedly call the police on me because I have big emotions. And because I am so stressed out, hungry from lack of food and have been emotionally chewed up and spit out, I don't have any control. I mean the shelter says on a sign ""dedicated to compassion"" and in a crying fit of rage outside on the street I yelled for 10 minutes about the lack of compassion and then spent another 20 minutes crying loudly  (as I do), standing against a brick wall.

The people here don't want me. They feel like I am super ungrateful  (I can't begin to tell you how guilty I feel for the pain I have caused)... they are keeping my cat here and all my stuff, but they want a plan in place that I cannot give them. Housing in my city is a problem. Too many people need emergency and affordable housing and the demand outweighs the supply x100 

This friend went on my Facebook page to ask my friends  (who she doesn't know), for help in housing me. Like a child of divorce deal 
""We get her Monday to Thursday you take her the other days and weekends""... 

It felt weird and when I deleted her posts she got upset. (And called her husband). 

This couple was demanding to talk to my support worker - because they feel he dumped me on them. I don't know what he was supposed to do for them... but I revoked my consent for him to talk to them.

My friend her husband are likely going to be mad at me because my worker does not work again until Tuesday. I will get almost no help from the housing department of my city because there's no housing. Shelters are full. 

And when shelters are full in off hours, staff come up with strange ideas. A few nights ago, after being discharged from the hospital - the city told me to sleep...at the hospital!  So I had to go back and get registered under the guise of ""we will admit her again to 'see the doctor'"". The doctor came in the morning and out I went...

I guess my thing is...

I feel like these people  (who make no mistake are kind and generous), are expecting more of me than I am capable of. I am often not thinking rationally, my deleted Facebook posts should not have been used a reason to let me stay (which it appears it is), and between my hunger and exhaustion, I am lucky if I dial the phone properly. 

She wants us to have conversations over text  (which is bad for me when I am upset), and I find they use the ""my house my rules"" often, which only makes me feel like a child.

I obviously don't want to stay here any longer than necessary - but at this moment - today - I have nowhere else to go.

39,"Can't never be alone with myself anymore. Obsessed with bf, abandonment issues","Hello people! I don't know where to write this and if this is the correct subreddit I should be writing but idc I just want to rant and get help maybe or some advice...

I'm 20F and I live with my boyfriend this whole year. And everything is so lovely and good and I'm so grateful I have him. He heals my heart... and this.. this is the bad thing. I thought leaving my parents that I was so attached to would help me with my abandonment issues that I didn't thought I had all these years and recently noticed. All my life I acted so independently, I never asked for help, I acted 25 when I was a little child, always caring about others more than myself but not a people pleaser. I just didn't care about myself much.

When I was a baby until 7-9 I was so attached to my parents I always felt empty when the house was empty once they left. I had this dread feeling in my heart and I felt it sink in and I felt the loneliness hit me like a train in only a few mins. I felt out of control and my thoughts drowned me. I couldn't stand myself at all I was so scared also. Now don't get me wrong we all have this fear as children that our parents won't return from the super market and they'll be hit by a car on the way and stuff, I had these thoughts as well but that was different. It is different still.

Fast forward to now, I have been trying to heal myself and traumas with homeotherapy and a bit of psychotherapy for the past 2-3 years. I have seen a lot of change in me I mean I do struggle with s. thoughts, self-harm, depression and many obsessions but I'm feeling healthier these past 5-6 months. But I've noticed that I'm great when only my bf is with me or I'm around people. I haven't been alone in more than a month, not even a single hour I think. I work 2 jobs for season and I return home to my bf I even cry or I express myself in front of him but never alone.. I didn't get a chance this month. And here is the deal.. today my bf unexpectedly decided to sleepover to a friend and I was waiting to go home to hug him and sleep but he told me while on work and this dread sinked my stomach again.

I felt like a little baby again. I felt alone. I felt myself for a bit. I realised I haven't been with my mind at all and I hated to feel it now all of the sudden. I needed preparation. There was a chance for him to take the last bus but he didn't and it's okay ofc he loves me a lot and he tells me every day but I felt the f abandonment issues to the core. I am not independent, I'll never be. I'll always stick to a person to be able to survive and to handle days.

I was living by myself and I ended up hospitalized and in a ward last year. I couldn't handle the situation even if I was 1 hour away from bf,parents. Now I'm far away from home and I've been clinging to him to be able to handle everything. Work is shit cuz it's work. I pushed away my 2 best friends slowly, I can't relate no more. I am alone without him. I need him more than he does, he doesn't understand what is like to be dependent with life to someone, to be so scared of them leaving you. I came home and thought immediately about s.h even tho I'm months clean and good.

Anyways all I'm trying to say is why? after all this healing, after feeling so good I accomplished things, why do I go back to 0 when I'm alone? why can't I just be? sober, healthy thoughts, alone? why baby me couldn't handle me and why can't I do it now either? how do I deal with this?

40,Is it wrong if i identify with BPD even if i didn't get diagnosed with it? i genuinely feel like i have BPD," 

In 2017 i got a psych assessment when i was barely 18 years old, they concluded i had OCD withNPD/BPD traits, they decided to not diagnose me with BPD/NPD because of my level of impairment. I however know that i have BPD because of the symptoms i have displayed since i was a kid and primarily since i was 17, which is the age where it became gradually worse, and now at age 21 has reached a tipping point.

i Have a childhood diagnosis of Intellectual Disability, and recently (yesterday) they brought up the idea of possible Autism Spectrum Disorder, and many times have said they didn't think i had BPD, however i am still reluctant to accept the idea i don't have a personality disorder.

Over the course of 3 years and self diagnosis, BPD has been the core of my identity. I have felt humiliated and excessively obsessive when i tell people i only have ''traits'' as i feel it severely invalidates my trauma and the pain i face everyday.

I have told people online/offline that i have BPD, and i seem embedded in my rigid delusion that i genuinely have this disorder, I feel as if the psychiatric system has let me down and has not provided accurate results because i am a male, and because of my disability. I was referred to a dual disability/mental health hospital as an outpatient for a 2nd assessment and will receive a diagnosis in 2 weeks, however BPD still seems unlikely to them.

The reason i relate to BPD so much is because of the behaviors i have, i can relate to ''BPD feels like having 3rd degree burns'', and i basically struggle with substance abuse, self harm, anger which is often irrational, and i don't know who or what i am as a person, and i have severe abandonment issues, i also experience extreme irritability over the smallest of things and will split on someone, from all good to all bad, rejection sensitivity, getting attached to people and wanting to marry them after a day, i've also struggled with thoughts of violence, homicide, arson, and grandiose beliefs. You can see my comment history and outbursts on reddit.

My psychiatrist told me that this time i will receive accurate results, and that he and his other 3 colleagues who are psychiatrists are working extensively to give me the diagnosis they see fitting",1588650131.0,False,0,2,babyboi1998,None,gdqhxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/gdqhxy/is_it_wrong_if_i_identify_with_bpd_even_if_i/
41,Should I stay in my messy relationship?,"I've been diagnosed with BPD since I was 17 (I'm 24 now) and I've done a lot of different therapies for it. I thought I was getting better for the longest time because I thought I had my emotions and everything under control, especially in relationships. I've been seeing my boyfriend for roughly 2 years and I've noticed I've completely went off the rails. Any sense of emotional stability I've had before has completed disappeared. 2 years ago I was holding down a stable and really good paying job for 3 years and I think they liked me considering they trained me in every department and would always complement my work. I also had lots of friends and was very social, I even had friends that I was friends with for 9 years (there would be a few years in between where we wouldn't talk because of them moving or just different life pathways but always found our way back to each other). I also was in university and bought a car from the dealership and my credit score was really amazing too. I really felt like my life has direction at that point. That was until my dad got his second DUI and went into rehab and came out of rehab doing meth and completely flipping out. That's when I met my boyfriend. It was such a a rough time for me, I had to talk to the cops a lot and get a restraining order against my dad for awhile. My boyfriend was unlike anyone else I dated, he didn't try and force me to have sex and I waited awhile before hooking up with him, and even before we had hooked up he was there to support me through everything! I was so appreciative and really fell in love because I thought he was so compassionate. He had recently went through a break up so I had a sneaking suspicion I was a rebound and I just wanted to know where he and him stood. He promised me I wasn't a rebound and he hadn't talked to his ex for a few months. My BPD started flairing up and I went through his phone (I'm sorry I know it's bad but I developed this bad habit from my last ex being with him for a whole year and trusting him but seeing millions of girls messaging him till I finally had a hunch and checked and was mortified, I just didn't want to waste my time again) I found text messages between his friend and him saying that if he hooked up with me he'd basically be tunnel brothers with all his buddies (which is far from true, he thought I hooked up with both his friends but I only hooked up with his one other friend once when I was blackout at a party and I didn't even really want it to happen) it hurt my feelings to feel like he was talking about me like that to his friends and kinda made me feel like a whore. I ended up flipping and waking him up with a garbage bag full of his stuff and sent him home. We ended up talking it out and we started hanging again. But then whenever he got drunk, he'd call me his ex's name, and he called her and said he loved her and missed her. I was devastated once again, but now I felt like an easy rebound whore. So we once again fought and he convinced me it wasn't that way, just to go and hook up with her the one night I asked for space (he is extremely codependent). I was pissed and tried to convince myself I was done with him. But I'm stupid so I forgave him, I think I only did that because of all the trauma I was going through with my dad, I really wanted someone to be there for me and hold me and tell me everything was okay. He was back at my place again for awhile and then he disappeared to his ex's place for a whole week and swore on his life he didn't hook up with her and was just there to support her through a rough time (he only recently told me they did actually hook up). I spent the whole week crying at work and just being miserable. He begged me to stay with him and I did, which is something I've never done before. I've never ever ever let someone disrespect me like this before, but I felt so low and vulnerable. We were together for awhile after all that and it was so hard for me to not want to abandon him at any fight we had. We fought a lot and were pretty miserable together. I was really trying to break things off but he kept claiming he really wanted to be with me. He hooked up with a new girl he met and was hanging with secretly behind my back at his friends place for a month or two. What made me really mad is I would let him drive my car over there while I was at work and I bought an Xbox for him to use at my place and he was playing games with her while I was at work. Anyways he hooks up with her and she has BPD too. So off the hop she started tracking his location and everything, so he came clean to me about it and told me she was crazy and regrets doing it. I told him that he should just be with her and just leave me alone. She ended up needing help and he convinced me to go pick her up and help her get drugs. She ends up getting me and him into doing those drugs (we've done it before and were completely sober, just have a hard time saying no when it's right in front of me). We all ended up going on a 7 day bender and by the end of it I was all alone and the most mentally fucked I've ever been. They ended up dating. For a whole month he kept pressuring me to come over and give me drugs to drive them around and he even pressured me into a threesome. I only did it because I'm stupid and just did kinda want to be high and see him. They were absolutely vile to me while I was there and I finally got the back bone to block them and sober up. She would make millions of tiktoks about how she fucked him in the bed beside me to put me in my place and how she wants to beat me up now that I didn't want to be their bitch. She even threatened to send a whole gang of people to my house if I didn't send her money at one point. I was nothing but nice to her, swear on my life! She wanted to put me in my place because I warned her that he can be cheaty and to watch out! And she claimed I was trying to break them up. She still to this day posts about me and it's been a year since him and her were last together. Anyways, I was dating someone and doing shitty but alright. Sober, university drop out, bluey watching, chain smoking, loser on medical leave from work. My ex got me up and I dropped everything to meet up with him and to hear how shit his life was without me (hopefully) and it was. He GOT HER PREGNANT!!! And was absolutely MISERABLE! I was rolling. I wanted to laugh in his face and go back to eating cupcakes and watching bluey buuuutttt I self sabotaged my life and decided I wanted revenge on the girl for being a dick to me so I broke up with my boyfriend ( I held him back anyways, he deserves way better then a dumpster fire like me) and I hooked up with him while she was pregnant and behind her back and threw it in her face and then laughed at the tiktoks of her balling her eyes. I know I'm horrible, I really wasn't thinking right, I was kinda off the rails and sick of feeling like everyone gets to shit on me and have no repercussions, if I could go back in time I would have never met up with him. I didn't want to get back together but I ended up hooking up with him long enough that we did (the sex is the best I've ever had for some reason and he really makes me feel safe because of being there for the stuff with my dad). Getting back together with him made all my friends drop me, they were already mad at me for being too depressed and reclused for awhile.I was an ass to him though, constantly mad about him even being with a girl that was so cruel to other girls like that (even though I kinda was cruel to her by taking him back for revenge for all the shit she did to me). We were once again miserable together but I had quite my other job and now we were miserable and broke. my mom got us a job together and we started to work and save up for an apartment (I'm good at saving, he blew my money and his). I ended up having to borrow the money from my grandma for first and last ($3000, which I still have to pay her back for) I was also the only one allowed on the lease because of my good credit score and before we moved in, while I was working over time, he was looking at the girls onlyfans. Turns out he used his first paycheck to subscribe and look at her shit. It was a big blow up fight and he told me he only wanted to see if she was posting their videos they made together. We already had the apartment lined up so I forgave him and told him to just be honest with me and to never do it again. By that point I was so angry and resentful towards him, I was miserable everyday. He refused to cuddle with me or be affectionate with me at all or even have sex with me. I started becoming an angry violent alcoholic and we started to go at each other. I fucked his teeth up and he left me all bruised up. Our apartment was disgusting, he never helped me clean or cook or do laundry, he just played videogames and ignored me. He also brought his dog that he got with him and that girl together to our apartment and it wasn't house trained so it peed on everything. The dog peed on the couch I bought so much that I had to pay to throw it out. It peed on my Tv remote, laptop, bed and pillows, like literally everything. I dislike dogs because my parents would get aggressive rescues when I was a child that would attack me and I grew up to find them loud, obnoxious, and gross. I was the only one cleaning up after his dog. I found him on onlyfans again buying a bunch of girls content when he couldn't pay his phone bill that was in my name since he had no credit to get a new phone ( I got him a brand new phone and a phone plan), and he was even short on rent most of the time. He literally would beg them to meet up and everything. I was officially numb and done. I tried for a whole week to break up with him sobbing and begging for me not too, he begged me to give him one more month and I agreed. But then his dad died. I was such a a cunt to him though when his dad was dying because of the onlyfans stuff and I dislike dogs and his mom has 13 dogs and her house is covered in piss, shit, dirt, and dog hair. The dogs literally pee on everything. So I tried to support him from a distance, even though I drove him to the hospital and made sure to buy his dad blanket and slippers and soup when he couldn't eat the hospital food. But when it came time for us to wait out his death at his mom's place, I really didn't want to be there for him. I wanted to be able to come during the day but then spend the night at my parents place which was 10 minutes away. But he made me stay and we fought a lot. After his dad past, since we took so much time to take care of him we ended up losing our jobs. I instantly applied for welfare to make sure we could still pay rent, he on the other hand didn't. So I had to borrow money from my mom to pay his half of the rent. I also had to start going to the food bank and he refused to come with me even though I was anxious. I had to make him apply for welfare to help me because he refused to let me have my friends move in for us to be able to pay rent. Eventually I had enough and broke up with him and instantly hopped into a new relationship. I spent the whole month away from him anxious and feeling like shit, he was absolutely miserable and missed me and called me crying everyday. I ended up finding out I was pregnant with his kid (break up sex 🙄) and so I got back together with him and ended up  misscarry on Valentine's day, which was not my worst Valentines day lmao. But since getting back together he's made major improvements and swears on his life he wants to spend the rest of his life with me and I hates himself everyday for what he did to me. He has made major improvements but now I'm so broken and fucked up, I've become just like him when he was treating me like garbage. We had to move into his mom's place since my dad started doing meth again and I have another restraining order against my dad. I just feel triggered constantly at his mom's place. So should I even bother staying with him at this point? He has changed a lot, but now I'm extremely toxic and miserable. I don't know anymore if I'm dumb for believing him still and if I should just get a backbone and leave for good?",1714374244.0,False,1,5,constellationcapra,None,1cfsqxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1cfsqxh/should_i_stay_in_my_messy_relationship/
42,How do I get better?,"I (20f) have been in a poly relationship for the past one and a half years with my partners 21f and 22f. For the majority of the relationship I have been completely okay, of course there have been ups and downs- my BPD has been what doctors have called ""quiet"" the majority of the time. This entire relationship has been consensual and for the majority of the time long distance with me living in the south, 21f living around 12 hours west of me, and 22f residing in Europe. 

I only started to feel insecure and unwanted in the relationship last July when I moved back go my home town to continue with my post graduate degree (yay full ride). When I moved it was fine for a few weeks, then when I started working again it seemed like I just stopped existing to 21f, she started to ignore me and act as if every time I went into work it was a direct attack to her- since I had less time to talk to her. Since I didn't want to hurt her, and to prevent me getting angry, I cut my hours and moved back in to my aunts home. Yet even after I cut my hours it was like I just ruined everything by having a life (she's physically disabled and had been out of work). We used to talk every single day but it went down to once a week, and I contemplated ending the relationship every day but I felt like if I left I'd just be compared to their abusive ex from like 3 years ago. So I stayed.

Nothing got better but I tried, I told them how I felt I tried every method therapy gave me, I bought them things they wanted, I spoiled them for their birthday but it didn't get better. Then my birthday passed, I was so excited and all I wanted was to watch a movie with them, but instead I got a long message about how awful their birthday was and how their parents did nothing for them and how jealous they were that I got gifts from my aunt (my parents are not in the picture). I was so ready to dump them that day but 22f convinced me not to- she was my rock during that time we talked constantly on call , constantly messaging yk? 

It got better with time, we were back to the before by September. But then I was talking about driving to 21f and she said no, she said she was too sick for me to come to her and that her doctor didn't want her to get sick. I understood since i am also immunocompromised- this was right after I got out of the hospital with covid and the flu. 

Not even a week later I got a message from both of them saying that 21f was going to be flying to Europe to be staying a month with 22f. I felt lied to, no matter how I looked at either of them it didn't get better. I told them so, I told them that it was their decision but that it was unfair how they treated me. I tried so hard to be calm and nice but all they said was that it wasn't their fault that I couldn't afford to fly to Europe. 

Despite the advice from my therapist I stayed, both of them telling me that my bpd was getting in the way of their happiness. I watched as they planned and Ultimately executed this plan this February. I woke up every day knowing that they were together in bed, I wasn't jealous of that I was mad. I was mad the entire month and was told over and over to calm down because clearly it was just my bpd overreacting. I listened, I thought I was the issue, I got angrier and angrier to the point that I was NV for almost two weeks straight, I couldn't talk- I could barely do anything (im also autistic). 

When 21f went back home I tried so hard to be calm, to forget but I can't. I'll never forget what they did to me. I feel so angry at both of them and objectively I know I'm the doormat for what I let them do to me but I just didn't want my bpd to affect them more than it already has with them being my fps. But now? I don't not love them but I still hate both of them. They both lied to me and then gaslighted me. I spent months in limbo hearing all their plans without me. 

I want to leave and I know it's dumb cause we're mostly long distance, but I feel so trapped. 21f has a tendency of always being a victim and every single fight that's ever happened always has to be my fault. Her ex also had bpd and she tells me at times she thinks I'm like him, despite knowing how much effort I put into not being like him its like a triumph card they use to try to make me a villain. They let things grow until they can't anymore and then blame me, its my fault they can't express boundaries, it's my fault they don't talk to me about issues (just because I don't know how to respond how they want me to). They expect me to always be their shoulder to lean on, and then when I can't I'm all of a sudden an awful subhuman who can't do anything right. 

I've been threatened with breaking up so many times by 21f its almost like a game, I can never be up to her standards. I'm like a broken record, I crawl back every time no matter how hurt I am and I just want an out. I'm not allowed to have friends I'm not allowed to go out, I'm just in a limbo. Ghosting isn't an option with how intertwined our families are- both of them know my entire family and I know theirs, this isn't just an online long distance thing we've known each other for almost 4 years now. I want an out but I don't know how to get one. I don't want to be a bad person everyone already judges me for my diagnosis and I don't want another reason for them to. How do I even fix this? How do I get better?",1711516417.0,False,2,2,thosewhohave_,None,1bou0so,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1bou0so/how_do_i_get_better/
43,I don't know why I have BPD,"this is very long and i dont expect anyone to read it, its basically a breakdown of my life and how i went from a good little christian kid to whatever the fuck is going on with my life now
my bpd confuses me. I've always joked that I've was born with a broken heart because during my childhood, I can't really remember anything traumatic happening to me and I had a good home life, yet I loved sad music and I remember being very young, like 3-4 and praying to God (I was just raised religious and I am a trans man and those things did not mix well even though I didn't realize my gender identity was the cause of a lot of unrecognized dysphoria that I thought was just due to the fact that I was chubby until I was a Junior in high school) to take me to heaven now whenever I got yelled at. In middle school I always felt left out and inadequate. In high school, I was not popular and was never once pursued romantically or had reciprocated feelings for any of my classmates. And although I wasn't bullied, my roommate (religious boarding school)freshman often snuck out of our room to go hang out with our other friend and I remember spending nights crying and wondering why I wasn't enough for her. I started experiencing depressive episodes during the winter and during my sophomore year I tried to seek help because it wasn't going away during the spring this time and was met with a ""you seem fine you've got that real Jesus joy in your heart"". and then junior year I went into a depressive episode that hasn't really seemed to lift completely to this day. I cut myself daily and isolated myself a lot and started gaining weight, something that I hated because I was already overweight and hated my body. I remember praying and crying and wondering why I was feeling like this and why this was happening to me. I viewed myself as lazy, worthless, unloveable, and a complete failure at the ripe age of 17. I lost my faith, my ambitions, everything. I also realized that I was bisexual and trans and this further worsened the depression because I knew my parents would not approve. I was hiding everything from them and trying to hold myself together and ""cure"" myself by using a horrible system of cutting myself for not completing chores/homework that I needed to complete but had 0 motivation or energy to do. I wanted to take my life, but before I could work up the nerve to I opened up to my parents about how I was feeling about everything about the LGBT stuff. they got me an online Christian counselor who helped but I was still dealing with the LGBT aspects of my issues because I was afraid of being kicked out of my school or being sent to conversion therapy. I knew I couldn't deny these aspects of my identity because I knew they were things that I couldn't change, the problem was that every single person in my life was, although most not aggressively, homophobic and transphobic. I saw a light of sorts at the end of the tunnel at graduation, and I figured if I could just make it out of high school and shatter the glass ceiling on my current life, then everything would be better. Senior year I took Lexapro and it didn't really seem to help, but I continued to take it. Unfortunately I gained more weight because of binge eating and was around 240lbs, not that much but I was easily one of the largest people in my school. I had an online girlfriend who told me she loved me and then later said she never meant it when we broke up. I started smoking cigarettes and weed and spent a lot of my time alone because half of the time when I tried to hang out with anyone I felt like I didn't really belong. I felt like a lot like I was on the outside of my own life and looking in. At this point I was also very bad and still am at taking care of myself, which I am very embarrassed about and am working on. I didn't shower as much as I should, I woke up with only 5 minutes to get to class, and really just kind of blundered through life because I was using all my energy on just keeping myself alive. Finally, I graduated, and things looked like they were getting better. I came out to my parents, and my previous good relationship with them tanked. things were weird, they acted like I was this whole new person but I still felt like I was just me. This hurt because of the obvious disapproval of the true me, in identity and opinions and personal values. this is still a source of contention with my dad mostly but I've learned to just tolerate his unacceptance of my gender identity. I felt alone and ostracized in my own house and college was the way I finally began to branch out into the real world. I met my best friend, began smoking weed daily which I think has proven mostly beneficial to me but I will not deny this may be problematic as well. I hung out with my new friend and then her friends who have become most of my current social circle daily and was never in the house. I took a break from college which turned into dropping out because I was changing career paths and found my passion in dog grooming, which was great. as I worked and had money to spend though, problems began arising. at this point I had started to feel somewhat out of control of myself, staying up too late before working in the morning, starting to do party drugs occasionally like Ecstasy, ect. while at home feeling like I was stuck in the past. I noticed that when I was out with my friends and living my own life, I was happy and although erratic and overly sensitive to feeling the need to belong and be inlcluded in everything, but as soon as i stepped foot through the door of my house i could feel my mood start to tank. I only even slept on nights when i worked in the morning. I felt the need to be able to do everything with my new friends and keep up, and i deeply needed them to like me. I was still unhappy with my weight, although beginning to like my appearance as i was able to present as my true gender. I am a hopeless romantic and have always wanted to settle down and get married. I had a lot of trouble finding love and felt unnattractive and undesirable. I also spent my money impulsively and was often broke and struggled to make it through a week on a part time paycheck. Because i spent so much time away from home and didn't have much money, I often skipped meals in favor of a pack of cigs or whatever random thing i was focused on. Because i was eating less and stiffled my appetite with cigarettes, i started to notice a loss of weight. I have never been athletic and especially now since i ran myself ragged constantly socializing or working, I've never consistently worked out or really seen any weight loss. So I started to skip meals on purpose occasionally and not just to save money. I desperately wanted to be skinny, something I've never been. It didnt get to be a problem until later when i really started to drop weight. First though, in late 2018 I met my current boyfriend and although it's only been about a year and a half, I'm certain he's the love of my life, and he feels the same. However, with all good things there are problems. He had a rough childhood and because of it has a lot of very difficult mental problems himself. At this point, i had stopped taking my meds after beginning walbutrin to combat how dull lexapro made me feel emotionally at times. I didnt like how irritable it made me and i barely remembered to take my meds anyways, and i was feeling elated with a new relationship and thought it was a good idea. i don't regret it because although i spiralled into a depression enough to admit myself to a hospital for a short while. They diagnosed me with bipolar 2 which didnt really seem to fit right since the hospital seemed to diagnose everyone with some kind of bipolar disorder and gave everyone abilify, the worst medication i have ever taken. Meanwhile, my boyfriend, B, was going through one of the worst mental health years of his life, and I tried to support him the best that I could. I definitely tended to ignore my own needs to help his objectively much more serious issues. I was also doing more drugs and just got a promotion from bather to groomer and had to transfer to a new store. I was very close to my coworkers at my first store but i didnt fit in with the other salon workers at the new location. I was feeling very out of touch with my social circle and extremely stressed out. Then one day, B had a very bad dissociative episode and didn't recognize me. I felt completely useless and pointless, especially since that morning I had also slept through my alarm for work; again. I remeber bursting into tears before getting my best friend, who i now lived with, to comfort B because I all I could think to do run. I then left the house and got into my car fall apart. I noticed Bs nightmare medication and zoloft, and without a second thought downed the entire bottle of prazosin and drove to a park. I then swallowed a handful of zoloft for good measure before i got a call from my best friend. When i got back to the house (god knows how i didnt wreck my car because i was definitely starting to feel the effects) They knew what was up immediately and then I was hospitalized for a second time, only a month after the first visit. Before my first hospital visit, I discovered one of my worst vices: cocaine. While i enjoyed other drugs, not counting weed, I didn't really care to seek them out on my own. But i fell in love with coke. i loved the way it made me feel physically, and finally the persistent exhaustion of being alive lifted and i felt like i could actually focus on something long enough to accomplish it. I was a nasty habit that gave me panic attacks, made me somehow even broker, and by the end of it I had gone from 240lbs to 160lbs since it made not eating even easier. I was also even more tired and irritated constantly. Thankfully my best friend had dealt with an eating disorder in highschool and called me out and helped me start eating better again. And then B and I tried meth. It was amazing, but it was also the fucking worst. We only did it twice, and the first time I personally only had a long, irritating comedown, but B dissociated so hard he thought he was 16 again for 3 days. The next time we did it i started to see things and have panic attacks at the thought of having to go to work in the morning. I called into work and that day we broke up because I wanted to get clean and he didn't. The next day we talked when we were clear headed we got back together, him now ready to quit too. I'm incredibly lucky that we got out when we did from meth because it would have destroyed us. Its something i still fear that I'll relapse into again, even though i dont really miss it except when I'm feeling especially dead inside. I told my mom about my drug use and this prompted a visit to a new psychiatrist who diagnosed me with BPD. It's nice to finally find a diagnosis that seemed to actually fit. I'm doing better right now, relatively. I found a medication that actually works, thank god for trileptal, B and I are mostly sober, the hardest thing we do now is acid every now and then, and we still smoke, just probably too much now. I've started DBT but had to stop because i got a new job and it didn't fit into my schedule, but now im on job number 3 of 2020 and its much more loosely scheduled so i can actually focus on my mental health for once in my life.
Anyways, the question I wanted to ask is I don't understand still why I have BPD. Everyone talks about how childhood trauama can ""cause"" it, and I know depression runs in the family, but not BPD. I come from a stable home where I was loved, although not really accepted but that wasn't until later on after my mental health started tanking. I feel guilty about it, and I can't help but think that I took a start for a good life and just shit all over it. I feel like such a family disappointment and I feel like im going to be stuck on this random, emotional rollercoaster forever and I'll just continue to destroy every good thing in my life. If i could pinpoint it to anything, I would think my roommate in freshman year sneaking out of our room might have been the start of the extreme fear of abandonment, but that seems like such a stupid, not traumatic or abusive at all thing to have caused me to go from who I was before, someone i can barely even remember what they were even like in terms of personality, to the dumpster fire ive become. Maybe theres some repressed memory of something happening to me, because I get asked if I was ever sexually assualted a lot, but I have no memory of anything like that ever happening and while I don't have a problem having sex mentally my body just doesn't seem to react that well to anyone other than myself. Maybe my brain chemistry is just that fucked that sometime as simple as a friend hanging out with someone else sometimes set it off. I just want to get to the root of the issue, any insight or if y'all also just want to spill your entire life story onto the internet feel free and I'll listen to you. Take care guys

44,Relationships,"Why is it so hard for me to care about myself unless I have no significant other to love me? I just destroyed another relationship with a man who really tried to be there for me... Through 3 hospitalizations, me staying in his bed for a week at a time... My complaining, fears, anxieties. 

He said he still loves me but we need distance because he does not feel right and he hopes I can get myself better.

Myself though... Myself... Who am I without someone else? I can lay in bed all week and nothing in this world would change for the worse. But what do I make better? What can I actually bring to others? How can I learn to find joy in myself? Especially now when all these memories of my relationship are so strong and sad. It hurts to anything, because everything reminds me of him.

In the past, I would have made some big scene and refused to agree to take a break. I want to talk to him so bad and promise to change (he just wants me to get a job and go to school and make friends)... But I don't want to male empty promises.

I should be able to just do this for myself.

Does anyone else have this thing where they feel anything they do is pointless and worthless unless you have someone to show or tell whatever you did or saw to? Is that a borderline thing?

How can I start having an actual loving relationship with myself so I can make a relationship with someone else work? It feels so bleak right now. Has been such a long year. And here I am, alone again, by my own accord.

I have had no problems getting a guy. Keeping them is a different story. Same things with hobbies, jobs, ect. I am able to do many things, but I flip out on myself and quit so easily.

45,"Trying to heal myself ,need some advice","I've been diagnosed with BPD since my teens (25 now). At the time I was addicted to drugs, cutting and one suicide attempt. Two hospital visits from that I met a guy who helped me get out of my rut , we lived together for 3 years with his support I finished nursing school and am currently a nurse. I ended up leaving him two years ago and had a streak of extremely unsuccessful relationships with very damaging people with warning signs so bright it took immense denial to stay in them. This last one really did a number on me and now it's over .. He left .. After all that lol. Now I'm trying to get over it, deal with feelings of depression but most of all my extremely deep feelings of loneliness, and insecurity. I've decided I need to start healing myself , started taking zyprexa ( which I have been on and off due to its SE of tiredness and drowsyness) . Zyprexa in particular BC it helps me eat , I have this obsession that if I gain 15 pounds everything will work out. I'm very thin I'm 5'2 90 lbs. I've been chain smoking a pack a day for a month.

46,So Stuck RN,"I have had periods of being very well emotionally regulated, mostly when I am modeling good behaviors/actions for others. What ultimately happens is I am so focused on others that I forget to tend to myself. I’ve had a few bottoms. One came during the plague with social isolation. I then got a WFH job and social engagements got super hard for me. Looking back I can almost see my self completely unwind. Stop going to gym, stop journaling, stop meditating, stopped taking showers, changing clothes, brushing teeth, then stopped taking my medications bc if I take the ADHD meds I feel locked inside my head and almost paralyzed on the outside. By this time my head had 8 different trains of thought on 6 tracks and at least one wants me to unsubscribe from life and they constantly whirl around up there. I asked for accommodations from my company and they then found a reason to fire me (Top sales rep, most customer compliments) and I tail spun. 

So I swore I would unsubscribe from life before giving up my 325ft studio apartment (bc it was mine and I paid for it all by myself) and move back in with my parents. Soooo…..my brother let me crash with him. My head was so dark and so mean to me that getting out of bed seemed impossible. Sublet the studio to someone who is trashing it and also wants to sleep with me. (Uggggg)

So now, I have done EMDR, ART, DBT, CBT and I’m therapy and have a psych and I’m still in this rut where I JUST DONT CARE ABOUT MYSELF AT ALL ANYMORE. It’s like the spark or fire went out. I can’t seem to find it. Brother was paying for top tier therapy and now it’s been downgraded to better help. He’s upset he’s not getting a return on investment bc I haven’t been able to be more regulated for the last 2 years. 

I’ve gained over 100lbs in 2 years thanks to gastroparesis from Weygovi/Ozempic/Rybelsus. 

I now have a bedroom that I operate out of and while my brother can be super encouraging and supportive, lately I only hear what I’m doing bad/wrong.

Now dad has had heart issues, step sis going thru divorce from a narcissist - she has two kids 4/9 and she’s a flight attendant with her own Truman’s manifesting in such dysfunction rn. (Which is effecting the kids)

I can show up for my dad and step sis and my niece and nephew and lately, I put the very disassociated mask on where I’m modeling good behaviors, showering, changing clothes, doing laundry, doing sisters dishes and laundry and going to doctor appointments. Did I make my psych appt this month…nope. Dad in hospital. 

When those duties/obligations end…..I deflate back into a dark hole who doesn’t really care if I see tomorrow. 

2018-2022 I racked up over 30k in debt, so there’s a bankruptcy that gets to happen, and I’ve asked multiple people to be my body double so I can sit down and get the information I need so I can file it. Currently, if I go back to work, one of my more aggressive lenders will get a judgement and garnish my wages. It’s so traumatizing for me that I did this to myself that I don’t feel safe doing it alone. 

I filed for disability bc it’s actually proving that me acting as the Geico duck in the boat plugging all the multiple holes (my family’s needs) is enough to be a full time job and I have adhd, ptsd, BPD, anxiety, agoraphobia, social anxiety. I don’t have clothes that fit. So I have mostly pajamas. I hate going in public and won’t do social things. And I’m so dysregulated rn that I couldn’t imagine working part or full time doing anything. 

I don’t know how or when we crossed that tipping line of full heartedly believing that my life is worthless. I don’t matter, I don’t want to be here, and have made certain promises to not do the thing I really want to do while parents are alive, or in family’s house. (This is one area where black and white thinking is helping me.) I care more about NOT inflicting trauma on my family than I care about myself.

I very much wish that I felt/believed/desired like I was capable of going back to giving a fuck, and taking my meds, and showering and looking forward to working out, wanting to be social, enjoying life rather than I have XYZ task that drains my batteries and takes all my spoons so now I need 4 days to recharge. It’s exhausting. 

I cannot seem to create and keep a routine bc nothing is routine. I’m pulled to take care of the kids or dad has new appts nearly every week. I’ve lost enjoyment and fulfillment in the things that used to make me happy like painting or singing. 

Everything hurts, every muscle aches. I don’t feel like stretching helps.

I find that I am seeing or aware of every flaw of my body and limitations since gaining all this weight. I could go on and on.

I’m getting frustrated at my limitations and when the frustration hits I’m not able to positively spin it to find a way to overcome it, the frustration is too loud and draining and before I can even acknowledge it and catch it to try to reframe it, my batteries are dead. 

I don’t know where to start or what to do first. I assume it’s one little thing to the next. I just don’t know how to do it when i genuinely don’t want to be here and don’t care. I am truly stuck. Like stuck stuck. 

Anyone with any experience with this apathy and stuckness, I’d really like some help from people who have been where i am and found a way to care again.

I live in the US and our mental health resources are limited and sorely underfunded and my family doesn’t have the resources to put me in a nice place for 90 days that would force me to have a routine.

47,Chaos,"(Tw: talk of suicide attempts, assault and breakups)

Hey everyone so I posted about a week and a half ago on some of these subreddits about my polyamorous relationship and had been looking for advice, I appreciated all the comments but I thought I should update on the events that played out.

So Friday of one of the weeks (my timelines a little blurry) I was laying in bed with my live in partner and he hyped me up to go on an adventure with him and despite having been fine laying in bed all day I got excited and started to get ready for our adventure.. midway through he told me that our two partners who had been having complaints about me needed him there by 5 pm (2.5 hours away from the current time but he had agreed to hang out til 9 pm) I expressed my disappointment and how uncomfortable it made me feeling left out and feeling abandoned.. (I added this part in because I'm trying to get everything in and forgot to add this part it was also part of why I wanted to talk written below)

I communicated my discomfort with my live in partner about the polycule and explained how I didn't feel like 2 of the others really understood me so I explained that I'd like all 5 of us to sit down and have a conversation (for the benefit of this story we have partner A and B that live together, Partner C that lives with me and partner D that lives alone but is best friends as well with partner B) 

C explained to A and B that I was uncomfortable and would like to have a sit down to talk about things because as it stood I felt unheard, judged and uncomfortable in our situation and I had spoke to him that night about it on the phone and I thought I was finally getting through to some extent..

I met up with C the next day and found out that he slept with B that night (this was the first time and he had also kissed her) this hurt my feelings a lot because I felt so unheard and disrespected so I needed to take a whole step back from the situation so I left our groups for the time being, blocked both A and B and I had a panic attack where I called my best friend because he told me out in public so I was literally sobbing and hyperventilating in public.. I had no problem with the fact that they slept together but just how disrespectful it was as I did my best to communicate my feelings.. I asked C to tell A and B I needed space and just couldn't right now.

After spending most of the night in a conversation with C where I was having a break down and my best friend sat there to be a bystander to make sure neither of us did anything dumb C ended up getting A and B to pick him up and breaking up with me.

The next day when I woke up and had calmed down and had been communicating lots with D between then and the morning both D and C told me I shouldn't message A and B but I felt bad for abruptly leaving and wanted to express I was sorry and explain my side of the story.. 

A mostly kept quiet and just sent me a link to a mental health place but said he didn't want to talk to me which was fine I respected that and I did not reply afterwards.

B however went off on a huge rant about how I apparently have been abusing C for 4 years and he has Stockholm and all this stuff and then told me to disappear.. for that day it really really got in my head and I found everything unbearable my brain hyper fixated so I shut off my location on everything and went to get medication and I wrote a note with no ill will or hard feelings to anyone inside just letting people know I always loved them and that I was sorry I had to do this.. I had blocked B on some social media but then she started going off texting me unprompted making it go into my head harder..

I had been messaging D all day and he could tell I was not alright and I took a lot of medication after a while and asked if he was scared to die.. I felt extremely alone.. word got out to everyone and my best friend rushed to my house and C got A and B to drive him to my house.

B came into my house and tried to lunge at me, I had to slam the door to separate us as I'm a passafist and don't like conflict and I was very confused why she was trying to attack me after telling me to disappear and telling me I had no redeeming qualities..

Once she left the house I came out and realized my phone was gone so I went upstairs and opened the front door to ask C if he had my phone and B was closed by and lunged at me again, again I made a barrier by slamming the door and things are a blur but I think I hit her with the door because I remember once I opened it again A got in my face but he didn't touch me so I can at least respect that.. 

C did have my phone so I had went outside to get it from him and I was standing near him and like balling my eyes out and my best friend showed up, B attacked me again but this time I had no wall to put between us she was grabbing and pulling me but a cop had shown up and saw it and he shoved her away from me and told her to go to her car.. I was urged to press charges but I have chose not to do this because I just want peace not violence.. I'm exahusted..

Once in the hospital they went through the normal steps of poison control and all that I won't go into too much detail but my best friend stayed with me til really late at night (she has a child and her brother isn't old enough to watch him for too long) 

The next day I spoke to the psychologist who deemed me not a threat to myself and let me leave but she has put me on a waiting list for a DBT program and I was already waiting on a counselling appointment on the 10th so she was happy with that. She told me she believes I did my best by stepping back from a situation that had triggered a lot of emotions so I didn't blow up and that I also made the steps to resolve the issue afterwards and she told me that I can't control how others react to what I say.. she's right but it's still hard..

Since then I have had 0 contact with A and B, C has visited a couple of times and I've been doing my best.. D and I message every single day and he's visited over night once and has also had a long phone call with me.. he's been my biggest support and every time I see or talk to C it feels suffocating.. I can feel his disinterest and it hurts.. anyways I just guess I wanted to give an update so I didn't leave anyone hanging since I know there's replies I hadn't gotten to because everything happened so fast.. anyways I'm single now and trying to find some kind of motivation to live.. I want to be motivated but as it stands breathing is even exhausting and I'm only living because other people don't want me to die and I know that's no way to live.",1712535842.0,False,6,1,PsychoLittleKitten,None,1byk0yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1byk0yj/chaos/
48,"I(25F) told my mum I want to talk tomorrow but I have no idea what I even want to say - Confront my emotional neglect or just go NC?? T.w. neglect, self harm, OD","Thanks in advance to anyone that reads and responds x 

Tl;dr - HAE confronted their parent/s about the damage they've caused, how did you do it and how did it go?? 

I know that this is probably going to be a fruitless exercise and I will more than likely walk away feeling x10 worse than I did going into it but something within me wants to try before I go back home to my flat the day after. 

Bit of backstory: I've been staying with my mum and stepdad since Dec. 19th and up until boxing day, things had been going pretty well. Since boxing day I've been totally ignored and all the feelings of emotional abuse and neglect that I've worked/still working so hard to overcome from childhood came rushing back with a vengeance. Ive spent several nights in tears, at least 2 evenings/nights wanting to self harm again, one night spent lightly self harming and ive reached the limit to what I am willing to put up with from her. 

Now I've tried several times to talk to my mum about the way I feel about how she acts and treats me, sometimes she seems to change for a few weeks before something inevitably angers her and she goes right back to her old narcissistic, emotionally immature ways. 

My older sister went non contact with her and moved away several years ago and I have been considering going non contact for the last couple years but something in me is holding onto hope that one day I will get through to her. 

I know many of you will say that it is pointless, that people like this dont change but I wouldn't forgive myself if I just went NC without trying one last time. The biggest problem I'm having though is that I have no frickin idea how on earth to begin this conversation. I know the gist of what I want to say to her but im scared she'll do the usual and just get defensive and angry for me essentially pointing out all the things she's done wrong as a parent. The inner child in me is screaming to be validated and to hear her say that she is sorry and if im honest, I am screaming at myself the same things. I understand that I need to be able to heal myself and shouldn't rely on her to do this in order for me to move on but no matter how hard I try (and I am really fucking trying) I cant seem to let the idea go. I'm pretty sure that this is because there are times when things between us are good and we can laugh together and talk like normal people without me feeling like im on edge just being in the same room as her. However, most of the time I feel like im either stuck in ""Freeze mode"" (the 4 F's) any time she talks to me, or one of the others (I can go into ""Fight mode"" very quickly because of my BPD which tend to just make any situation worse) 

Now, middle of last year I ended up in hospital a couple nights because of an OD and after that I feel like my mum started to take my mental health slightly more seriously because I told her that she was a lot to blame for how I had been feeling. I also recieved two diagnosis' last year of C-PTSD and BPD. This isn't something I feel my mum takes very seriously and this is one thing I know I want to talk to her about. 

Things my mum likes to do during these convos in the past include but aren't limited to:
- say I should move on and let things go
- gets angry/sarcastic/defensive
- starts playing the victim 

How do I tell my mum about all of these things without sounding preachy or nagging and just making her angry and defensive??",1609810694.0,False,1,1,SingingWanderer1195,None,kqnfuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/kqnfuc/i25f_told_my_mum_i_want_to_talk_tomorrow_but_i/
49,Canadian mental health's week,"This week is Canadian mental health’s week.

I cannot remain silent. I have witnessed so many prejudices related to different mental illnesses. And I have been victim myself of some prejudices related to my mental illness.

I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and I have an eating disorder (ED). 

I am trying really hard to recover from my eating disorder. It has been a year since I am in therapy and take medication. Even though I am on the path of recovery, I am still sick. My day-to-day existence is still challenging. I have been victim of many misconceptions people have about my disease. Today, I want to break those misconceptions. 

First of all, I have gone to my family doctor before my eating disorder went out of control. I’ve told my doctor I was worried about the relationship I had with food. I’ve told her that every time I felt angry, sad or anxious about something, I ate. I’ve told her that I often got up at night to eat things I didn’t allow myself to eat at daytime. I’ve told her that I was sometimes craving for junk food. I’ve told her that I was often eating so much that I felt a pain in my stomach. I’ve also told her that I was constantly checking my weight because I was worried that I was weighing more than my friends. Those are the common symptoms of an eating disorder. My doctor didn’t take me seriously. She didn’t consider my eating behaviors as a problem. Actually, she told me it was quite common among teenagers to like junk food and to eat “too much”. 

For a couple of years, back in high school, my eating behaviors remain the same. I was stealing money from my mother’s purse to buy junk food. I was hiding food in places where my mother could not find it such as my room’s closet. I had drawers filled with wrappers. 

Then, it got worse. Two years ago, I had convinced myself that I had some kind of virus and that I couldn’t digest food anymore. For a week, I had stopped eating. My close ones were worried but they didn’t question my behavior because I had convinced them I had a virus. When I started to eat again, food disgusted me so much that I felt like I couldn’t keep it: I had to throw it all away. And that is what I started to do.  At first, I told my parents that I was throwing up because of the virus. But, it kept getting worse. I could barely eat with them. And when I did, I ate a ridiculously small amount of food. I was throwing up after each meal. And I had started to skip meals. In a matter of a few months, I had lost a lot a weight (something like 25 pounds). At one point, I couldn’t concentrate at school anymore. I was feeling weak. I was feeling anxious around others. At that time, all I wished for was to disappear completely. I told my parents I needed to go to therapy. I knew something was wrong but I didn’t know what it was. My first therapist diagnosed me with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), related to a sexual assault I had been victim of a couple of years before.  Then, I was diagnosed with Depression. Then, I was diagnosed with social anxiety. Then, they found out I had an eating disorder: I was diagnosed with bulimia nervosa. Finally, after a suicide attempt and a stay at the hospital, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). 

I have found it really difficult to hear about the final diagnosis because I knew that this one was accurate. When my therapist first described to me the symptoms of BPD, all I could think was: «It is me. It is all me. Is it all that I am? Am I a disease?» For those of you who don’t know much about BPD, there are nine specific symptoms to this illness but you only need to have five of them to be diagnosed with it. First of all, BPDs fear abandonment. That’s why BPDs make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. Because of that fear of abandonment, BPDs have unstable relationships. BPDs relationships are often intense and short-lived. Also, BPDs have unstable self-image. BPDs may feel good about themselves for a short period of time and then hate themselves. BPDs often don’t know their needs and desires. They may change values, goals, and even sexual identity. Because of their unclear self-image, BPDs engage in impulsive or self-destructive behaviors such as self-harm, risky sex, alcohol or drug abuse, binge eating. Those self-destructive behaviors can lead to suicidal behavior. BPDs also have intense emotional swings. They are described as hypersensitive. In fact, Marsha Linehan, the psychologist whom invented Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), which is now used to treat people with BPD, says: 
“People with BPD are like people with third degree burns over 90% of their bodies. Lacking emotional skin, they feel agony at the slightest touch or movement.” BPDs also experiences chronic feelings of emptiness due to their unstable self-image and their lack of self-confidence. BPDs can also struggle with intense anger and can have trouble controlling it. More frequently, BPDs direct their anger towards them. Finally, BPDs can experience episodes of paranoia where they feel suspicious about other’s motives and out of touch with reality.  That feeling can lead to out of body’s experiences. 

After I was diagnosed with BPD, I knew I had to tell my close ones. The impact of the symptoms on my life was so important: I could not pretend that they did not exist anymore. My therapist had warned me that the reactions to my diagnosis could be quite inadequate due to all the misconceptions people have about mental illnesses. Unfortunately, people often see BPD’s desperate calls for help as attention seeking. For example, that is often the way people feel about self-harm and suicidal behavior. Another common misconception is that people think that all BPD sufferers are extroverts. People think all BPDs express their intense emotions at the exact moment they feel them. In fact, some of us keep a lot of those emotions to ourselves. Sometimes, it is because we are not sure how to express those feelings. Sometimes, it is because we don’t even know how we feel: there are so many emotions trapped inside of us that ask to be released.  If you know someone suffering from BPD or from any other mental illness, you have to know there is no magic way to cure for those illnesses. The person who suffers from a mental illness has to be ready to recover and that feeling can only come from her. There is nothing you can do except stand by her side while she is trying her best to recover.  

I hope that my statement will help to demystify BPD and Bulimia Nervosa among some of you. And, I hope that those of you who suffer from any mental illness will feel less lonely. I also hope it will encourage you to speak up to stop the stigmatization of mental illnesses.

50,Does this sound like BPD? Advice getting ex back. My story.," 

Hi fellow redditors,

this is my 1st post on here and I would love your advice on an ever struggling issue for me. Im 22 years old and nearly 2 years ago my girlfriend decided to call ties on our relationship of 3 years, the reasons she gave me for ending the relationship came down to I let myself go (weight gain), and she felt I wasn't committed to the relationship for the future and she wanted to work on herself and I should too, she also felt I was abusive manipulative and controlling , I would also like to add I was Diagnosed with Asperger syndrome around this stage of my life (which I have now found out I was misdiagnosed and I am currently going through a diagnosis of BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) also im sorry for the very long post, but this had been in my mind for ages and I need to get it out.

&#x200B;

To give a background on myself, growing up I had an unusual upbringing my parents split before I was born so I would travel down to my fathers and spend the weekend with him, my dad was very abusive he would never physically abuse me but would mentally control me and make me feel like I have no one but him, this started from the age of 8, I would witness him beat his sister for money as he lived with her. I would see him start on my mother and clench his fists like he was going to strike her, as far as I know he never hit my mother but he manipulated her as she was vulnerable lady, he did the same to her as he did to me and my aunt. He would kick off over the smallest things like not finishing your dinner or dropping a cup, I felt like I was treading on egg shells, I was genuinely scared of my dad, I still am even though we maintain contact he will never know he abused me as I can't stand up too him, I do love my dad but I resent him. growing up I always carried extra weight than the average child, at school I was called fat, and would often lose my temper and chase kids and hit them, I would get in trouble for this and would always take the blame ( I still don't know why I would do this as if I seen someone as my friend I would let them do anything to me), I even took the blame for things I didn't do such as cutting a girls skirt, which I could have never done as I wasn't in school that day, but I still took the blame and had to pay out for the girls skirt with my savings and got a huge telling off from my father. Going into high school I was bullied again for having weight but also for having long hair, as people thought I was a girl, as I am quite a feminine looking guy id say which didn't help, I was picked on every day for being different, but I took it until one day I cracked and was put in a supported learning centre at school as I was saying I wanted to kill myself at the age of 12. When I hit 13 my dad packed his things left the country and flew to the Philippines he had met a women online and packed his things and left, he said he was coming back, you can guess what happened. I have seen him once since then, I would say him leaving me is one of if not the most traumatic times of my life, I was angry all the time, I was losing my temper at school and was having suicidal thoughts. at around the age of 13. I was in supported learning and things were looking up for me, I even got my 1st girlfriend which at the time felt like a good thing, but looking back it wasn't the best of things, she had a reputation for being a bit of a sleep around, so this drew attention too me which I didn't really need, overall I as pretty much her bitch, I followed her around, did what she said and what she wanted, I lost my virginity at a young age to this girl, I was 14, I felt uncomfortable saying no, as it was my 1st girlfriend and I didn't know what I was doing, she would flirt with other guys and id let it slide, I didn't feel jealous, just grateful to have a girlfriend, after a few weeks we split up as she cheated on me with an 20 year old boy, I knew it happened as she asked to use his toilet and left me outside for 15 minutes...Classy, I dumped her and out of retaliation she told everyone at school that she was pregnant and I was the father, which I believed even though it wasn't possible, she also made remarks about my mother who is disabled to the whole school revealing my mum couldn't get up and down the stairs without pain, I was teased, bullied and considered as a person who if you hanged around with would give them a rep. after a few weeks of not going into school I thought it would blow over, of course it didn't... she ended up getting her aunt up the school to threaten me as my step-brothers girlfriend told her to leave me alone.

&#x200B;

After a few months of very little attendance to school I met another girl, this time she wasn't at my school so it was easier to deal with, it was a long distance relationship, we spoke for a good 7 months before we met, she seemed a nice funny girl who had a great sense of humour, but she seemed to have some mental health issues which to this day im still unsure off i was around 15 and so was she, her mum allowed me over to hers to stay and she would come over to my house during summer holidays, she was what I would call a control freak, I was not allowed to talk to any females, even my friend of over 5 years at school who was only attracted to females, I dropped her and everything for this girl which I know in the end was my choice, but I allowed her to be the only thing in my life, in return she did the same, I didn't ask her too she just did it, she went on my facebook and deleted all my friends who were female, except family of course. After meeting her the 1st time I had a great time, I travelled up to her and stayed 2 nights, after leaving, she started acting strange, she was threatening to kill herself, I wondered why, the answer was because I left her, she was very manipulative and controlling, the last time I experienced this was with my father, it got the point where she would cut her wrists and send me images of it, I then made a plan, try to stop her from self harming, we took all the blades in her house and encouraged her to throw them away, she did, 6 months on, no cutting, we as far as im aware anyway, then rather than abuse herself she would take it out on me, she started disappearing and threatening to throw herself under a train while I was at home and powerless to do anything, she would threaten me with boys and play on my jealousy, I was never jealous over a girl before so it never bothered me,until she kept pushing for a reaction, eventually I reacted, then when I reacted she would stop what she was doing, this worked for so long, I woke up everyday scared to speak to her for she might kill herself if I didn't please her, it eventually got too much, I wasn't sleeping well, then one night I lashed at her, pushed her onto my bed and shouted at her, she started crying, after I calmed down she got in my face and was trying to provoke me to hit her, I didn't she kept pushing and pushing until I pushed her away and pinned her down with my knee screaming for her to leave me alone, I seen red, I didn't look at her as anybody,more like a feeling that I wanted to go away, she cried and told her mother who told her to stop seeing me as I was abusive, months went by and she still stayed with me, but now she knew what would provoke me, I lost control of every emotion so easily, I was going crazy, I stopped going to school, I sat at home all day on skype to her, I dropped everyone my friends my family, I felt trapped in a bubble, I had no one, she seemed happy like that, then she met a guy who she spoke to when I was sleeping, I questioned how it was fair for me to not speak to anyone but she could, she didn't respond. looking back I feel like she used him to push me more, which it did if im honest, me and him got into an argument, all over her, she then gave me a choice either behave myself or shes picking him, I responded in a moment of sense and said ''fine have him'' I hung up blocked communications and haven't spoke to her since, looking back I should have done it all sooner but I didn't, I struggled to walk away until that moment, I know I did some bad things, I was abusive and controlling towards her, I feel like maybe I picked up some ways of manipulation from her if im honest as the behaviour I showed is very similar.

&#x200B;

After a long struggle and a year away, I decided to seek help for my behaviour and mental health, I was given a CPN and was later diagnosed with Asperger syndrome (looking back now I felt things where turning around for me at this point) even though now I know I don't have Asperger's the help I received emotionally helped with my mood and well being at the time then I met her...the girl of my dreams, she was beautiful, she had the most beautiful green eyes id ever seen,she was simply perfect, we started out as friends online we used to laugh and joke on the phone, we played video games together, she always knew how to make me laugh and smile, she was my best friend.

&#x200B;

To give a quick background of the relationship after we met online as friends, she had an issue with lying as do I but im not going to judge someone as I have my own problems to deal with, she would arrange to meet and then cancel last minute I was 17 at the time and she was 19. I struggle with abandonment issues as my dad left from a young age which caused a problem in relationships for me in general. But at that stage of my life I didn't realise I had the issues I do now. Eventually we got to meet face to face, it clicked from there, I felt like I was on top of the world, she was so perfect, but from day 1 I was scared to lose her, I was obsessed to check her phone from day 1, I felt an anxiety feeling in my stomach whenever she left the house or spoke to anyone, I was genuinely afraid to let her go, I suffocated her, looking back it wasn't right from day 1. But I loved her and she loved me but I expected her to be perfect which meant she could only ever disappoint me.

&#x200B;

We met in an airport after she was over here too see her family, I felt like I couldn't let her go, I have just had a wonderful few hours with this girl im crazy about, and now shes leaving after 8 months of waiting, so I convinced her too come back with me and stay over for a couple of weeks, she resisted at first but I persisted and she eventually missed her flight and came back to my house with me, her mum was worried, she messaged everyone wondering where she was as she was due home that evening, after spending the night with her she got in touch with her mother. It all came out, I found out the lies she told me and that her mum didn't like me as she felt I was a nice guy with a dark side, but after speaking to her mum on the phone for around 2 hours she said im not as bad as she felt originally. After she spent 2 weeks here (as she had time of college for summer) we mad an agreement to let go of the previous few months as we were in love.

&#x200B;

After 2 weeks she said too me she wanted to stay ( I feel I took this too literal), her plan was too go home and come back and forth and we would see each other every few weeks etc, her mum was even willing to let me stay over which was a nice gesture considering she had an issue with me to begin with. But I couldn't let her go, this girl I was crazy about, I just met her, but for some reason I couldn't trust her (I was cheated on in the past so I presumed it would happen again), I was scared she wasn't coming back, so I manipulated her to stay, I know its wrong, I knew at the time, but I didn't want to lose her, I just wanted her and only her, when she phoned her mum to tell her she wasn't coming home, I seen a tear in her eye, looking back this haunts me to know I could make someone feel so low and saddened but at the time I only cared about myself (I feel like a horrible human being. A few days later we got into an argument she was on edge already for obvious reasons, then I snapped lost my temper and kicked her out my bed, she lay on the floor crying, I tried to get her up but she wanted to be left alone this was the 3rd time this happened too me in my life, when I was 13 I put my hand round my 1st girlfriends throat after she smacked me across the head with a with a hardback cover textbook, as the weeks went by I kept pushing her buttons, it was like everything she did for me, moving to another country, leaving her family, was never good enough, I didn't appreciate it I expected it. I was saying nasty spiteful things to her and she would only take it for so long, my mother thought it would be a good idea if she was staying in the uk for her to go to college and continue her acting course, she didn't seem to interested but was willing to do it if it meant she would be with me, she was golden, she did absolutely everything for me. Then after her being accepted to a college, I decided to travel to college with her, she didn't go to college, I stopped her, I was scared she was going to go to college and meet someone else, so I stopped her, rather than encourage her I trapped her, she was with me 24/7 stuck in 4 walls living out a suitcase, eventually she helped me put her clothes away but it took a month, she did everything to make it work and I did everything to stop it, after a few arguments here and there, I was dropping her at college (after my mother told me to give her space as id ruin it, I said id try and give it a go) I started saying nasty things too her until she snapped and punched me in the face on the street, I felt that this was the point I pushed her, she then tried to get the bus for college before I took the ticket and ran off, control at its most obvious, looking back I can see what a monster I was and it makes me feel sick to my stomach, I persisted on pushing her, until one day she tried to get away from me, I grabbed her by her handbag and it wrapped round her neck and choked her, I didn't intend to do that too someone, I was angry, all because I wasn't getting my own way.

&#x200B;

The next thing for me was the start of the end, we were arguing, I said something about her ill mother and she snapped, she hit me, and I snapped back and did something I said I would never do and that's lay a hand on a woman, I hit her in the arm, it left a bruise she kicked out at me and kicked my ass to be honest, I was in sheer shock that I ever did that too someone I ''claim'' to love. It makes me feel like im not a real man knowing I did that too someone. She told her mother who straight away questioned if it was true, as she told a lie before, the minute I admitted I laid a hand on her daughter she was done with me, she would no longer support her daughter in this relationship, she never spoke to me again. My grandmother always said I would find someone who I felt right for me, but id mess it up, I feel I did this. It was the start of the end, it was always gonna be a struggle from this point. I needed help, way before this relationship, but was too deluded and arrogant and felt it was never my fault, I played the victim to get my own way, and bless her soul she still stayed with me through all of that, she held on for as long as she could, because she believed I could do well, she defied her mothers pleads for her to return home at that moment because she felt I could fix it, the police were threatened at my door but she wouldn't allow it, she had believe in this relationship, but I feel I was too far gone already, we had many fights mostly verbal, but the odd physical exchange, then something clicked and we both agreed to stop the fighting. it stopped, but her mum would never forgive me. And never did. even though we wasn't hitting each other, I kept tabs on her, she spoke to no guys, I got jealous if she did, I read all her messages, even ones between her and her mother that were quite personal, all because I was trying to catch her out, with something that would justify that I wasn't good enough, I always accused her of cheating, I can honestly say she never looking back, even though I wouldn't blame her if she did to be honest, after a long 8 months of ups and downs she finally returned home. I didn't stop her, she was at home for 2 weeks, she sounded so happy too see mother, but I wanted her back, I missed her, I had to get her back somehow, so I decided too ask her if she wanted to try for a baby, she always expressed her want for a child at some point, to settle down and have a family. She seemed so happy so she would sit on the phone too me for hours talking about names, the last time she was this happy was the day we met, within a week of course she returned to me, I liked the thought of settling down with this girl I was so in love with her, but wasn't ready at this moment, I am not proud of this and I understand its playing with the mind of a girl and pulling her heart strings, but at the time I was only thinking about me and getting her back to me. I also want people to understand that I don't do these things because I am en evil person, I do these things subconsciously I can't explain why if I could I would, she came back and the life in the relationship was back, until the moment the baby was mentioned, she was devastated, I felt bad but I was happy she was back.

She stayed with me for another 2 months or so before going back, she was living out of 2 houses and 2 wardrobes back and fourth. I feel she gave me everything but I expected more, it was like this for a few months, then one day she did something that pissed me off I can't even remember what it was it was that petty, I dumped her, ignored her for a week, she tried everything too get me to just even give her a hug or a cuddle, I ignored her, she even tried sexual acts to just feel my love, I had sexual contact with her and just continued to blank her, I can see how this would make someone feel a certain way. I convinced her it was best she stays at home with her mother from now on, I manipulated her to leave me, she went home in tears asking me if there would be another chance, I said I'm unsure. I feel at this point it was well and truly finished, I didn't want to dump her, I was just angry at the time, I was so cold, even my mother pulled me and said I was being foolish and unreasonable, I was just so pissed off, my week was ruined for some reason. She left, I knew the minute she got on the bus I made a mistake, but was too stubborn to admit it, she then thought we was finished, she made plans to start hanging round with her friends, the minute I seen this I jumped reacted and explained too her it was a mistake, she felt this was a cry from me because she was going out, she didn't believe me, I feel she accepted it finished there. I was a mess, I didn't sleep for 5 days scared she would meet someone and get over me, she met up with her friend and 2 guys and I freaked, I was so scared that was it for me and her, and to be honest looking back, if she did do anything it was none of my concern as we finished, I made her feel worthless and she needed someone at the time, I convinced her I needed too see her, so I flew over to hers and booked a hotel, it was a few days of me trying to get her back, I could tell she was hurt by my actions so she wasn't too keen, I was scared she was going to sleep with someone or move on, so I did what I could to stop it. After flying home a few weeks later she came back to mine. things were different, I felt like she didn't love me anymore, I don't blame her if she didn't it should have ended, and I was hanging on for life, she said I needed to show her I won't repeat the same actions, so I did everything I could to hide my behaviour, it didn't last for long, she eventually gave me one more chance, and it was my last.

I flew over too her for a few nights, she wouldn't leave the hotel room as someone she knew was in the town centre, I felt this was strange as she wouldn't explain why she didn't want too see that person, a few weeks later her and that person were hanging out together, they were just friends. But I didn't see it that way I seen it as another guy who was trying to take her away from me, I forbided her to see him, she refused, she was sick of my controlling ways, she told me to deal with it or she will leave me. I had no choice, if im honest I feel that she was planning to finish with me months prior too the date she actually did, its just she couldn't do the act of ending it, so tried to push me too do it for her. She then told me she was going to stay in a hotel in the city centre with him and an old school friend as they were meeting and going to a nightclub, I went crazy, and was telling her id kill myself if she went, she wasn't having it and dumped me instantly, she then told me she couldn't remember the night of the nightclub, this drove me crazy, then 1 last time she came to see me (this was goodbye) she took 1 look at me and knew, I could see it on her face, she was no longer attracted too me anymore, I had gained weight and stopped taking care of myself, she knew it was done, the whole week she wouldn't hug me or anything, she then told me I was fat and she wasn't attracted too me anymore, I was devastated but I knew it was too late if im honest, she left and kissed me like the day she met me. it was goodbye. after a few days her mum was in hospital, I had a plan to get her back, it was never gonna work, she was spending more time with friends and pushed me too the side, I heard from her once every few days and we just drifted, I was selfish and should have understood that her mum was ill and I wasn't the person she needed there anymore, until one day she told me she was out with the guy and his friend and I went mad again, it ended with a message wishing me luck and saying goodbye.

6 months later. I had gained even more weight, I was loosing my teeth from not looking after myself, I was a mes I stopped looking after myself, I was depressed life was not worth living anymore I had blocked communications with her, as I knew she did too me. I questioned everything, my gender, my sexuality, everything, I was 280 pounds (20 Stone) I had one last desperate attempt, 6 months after the break up, I contacted her, she told me I was her past and she had moved on, she then wished me luck, I was devastated but something in me that has never happened before bloomed inside my stomach, I had fire, fight, and I said too myself that I will prove her wrong, a few months later, she contacted me too let me know someone had died who we used to both share a common interest in, I replied then wished her a merry christmas and happy birthday.

1 year on, I am 198 Pounds (14 Stone) , im currently going through a diagnosis of BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) too understand why I am this way, I have adopted meditation as a way of coping with my emotions, I have grown up, I was a bad person before, but I am no longer, I may have done bad things too people, but I wont allow that too shape my life, 1 week ago she contacted me, my dog passed away and she was very close to my dog, I realised after speaking too her that I am still in love with this girl, I understand what I have done in the past is wrong and I will own up too anything I have done, but is there any advice anyone could give me on how too show her I am the man she wanted all those years ago, that I am a changed man, that I no longer am the way I once was, I'm not expecting the odds to be very high, I probably have a 1% chance, but for her I'm willing to take it, she is talking too me very briefly but of course she is distant, does anyone have any advice, or should I just walk away and live my life, I will regret it if I don't try even if I fail I can at least say I tried.
