0,"Competent psychiatrists will never diagnose someone under the age of 18 with a personality disorder. Additionally, from personal experience, I can tell you with absolute assurance that BPD is just one is those labels that mental health professionals don't want to reveal to patients. And that's simply owing to the misinformation out there about this illness, in terms of stigma and inconclusive online literature. The diagnosis is hidden from the patient in an attempt to protect them from overthinking and spiralling. However, now that you are an adult, you have every legal right to demand an accurate diagnostic finding. Have a candid conversation with your doctor, I assure you it's more to do with the rules within the psychiatric community, and less to do with you. You got this.",,17szsas

1,"I know what it feels like to have a cheating dream or dream where I did something horrible. Usually by the next day I feel okay, although sometimes I have back to back nightmares. Over the years I started having less by removing stressors, so if that's a possibility then it might help. Other than that I also listen to podcasts like ""Get Sleepy"" and ""The Nothing Much"" podcast. I have to listen to them the whole night or my sleep is weird, but it helps to listen to a happy, sweet story before bed. I also sometimes keep my nightlight on or look at a collection of cozy images on my phone that I get from Pinterest. I try to really imagine being in those happy places. Things like log cabins or rooms with pastel decor. Whatever floats your boat. Finally, after I have a nightmare, I try to write a letter to my brain or rewrite the nightmare but with a happy ending. Some nightmares can't be written with a happy ending so I write a letter to my brain saying ""why did you make me have this weird dream? I know you are a bit scrambled from ptsd but I would never do that because (x reason)."" It doesn't always help. Sometimes I feel so hopeless about nightmares, but please know you are not alone and the fact that the things in the nightmare are bad to you is a good thing. It means you would never really so it. Hope this helps. Good luck from one nightmare-haver to another!",Cobalt-Royal,hcxif1

4,That makes sense! Do you think you should develop a strong relationship with a person before moving as deep as a group of people? It sounds really hard to tackle the group aspect as there's a lot of chaotic variables. Maybe I'm overthinking it. I've always wanted a group when I was younger because of my loneliness and over use of social media and then I realized I'm more of a one on one person. You should see how excited I get at parties with strangers. It's because none of those bad thoughts exist because I don't know them. It's a conundrum.,EagleMaleficent4602,1cl574f

0,"I recently was diagnosed with BPD.

0,"Hi! I'm new here too and also new to reddit in general. So I hope I'm not doing something wrong with this reply but I'd like to give advice as someone who was diagnosed around 2 years ago. (F20) 
 For starters, theres lots of stigma around this disorder. I've been through residential, iop, and php, (if you dont know these are inpatient/outpatient treatment centers, or what's considered ""rehab,"" where you live there and go to group everyday, possibly with Sundays off, for 3-6 hours a day. You stay in these facilities on average for 1 month) and even the professionals there can get nasty even upon hearing the diagnosis. (Ex. I was already diagnosed before entering, and each facility immediately refused my diagnosis, and then were disgusted after doing assessments/noticing symptoms and behaviors) With that being said, it's going to hurt while you're doing research and you come across people who make us out to be monsters. I still encourage you to do a lot of research. I would encourage most people to do some form of treatment. (I understand that money can be an issue I owe 7k to treatment centers even with my good insurance.) One thing I did when I was first diagnosed was I bought the DBT skills workbook. Professionals will say meds are only half the battle. For me, they are none of the battle because I was on 20+ different ones during treatment and I just don't currently feel like that's my way of going about it. Also important: Bpd CAN go in remission. I notice people acting like their bpd will be crisis level forever. It really doesn't have to be that way. I'm not completely better by any means, but I've for sure improved since I found out I had it. This is starting to get long so lmk if I can help anymore!

1,"I‚Äôm literally going through this right now. It‚Äôs tough to feel this way. My partner loves me so much and has always been so patient but lately I feel like he‚Äôs been getting sick of my disorder and it just makes me feel even guiltier abt my existence. It‚Äôs hard to not also cause a fight over feeling like he‚Äôs losing his patience for me.

Another thing with BPD though- we have to give these people who are with us grace. YES we have to feel the shitty emotions that are enough to take us out on a daily basis. BUT, they also have to sit there and deal with us and these emotions they cannot comprehend. That can be really confusing and stressful sometimes! If I were a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person and saw the shit I get mad over I‚Äôd be like wtf girl üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠. They‚Äôre allowed to feel their emotions just like we are! They can‚Äôt always be smiles and rainbows just because they don‚Äôt have BPD. That‚Äôs a CRAZYYY unrealistic standard to hold our partners to. 

Two things can be true at once, okay? They can be human beings with their own valid emotions and they can still love us at the same time. Obviously a relationship with one person being a borderline requires effort, understanding, and patience from both sides. But we need to keep in mind that it‚Äôs ON US TO HEAL OURSELVES AND LEARN TO EMOTIONALLY REGULATE ONE DAY! ‚ù§Ô∏è

At the end of the day if your partner respects you and your relationship and makes you feel loved that‚Äôs what we deserve, to be loved! We can‚Äôt always expect the people we love to completely understand us or respond the way we want them to. In my personal experience I mostly feel the way you do because I idolize my partner WAYYY too aggressively sometimes. It‚Äôs hard to work on but it can be done! ‚ù§Ô∏è

If you truly still feel like it‚Äôs your partner who is neglecting your feelings or purposely does try to trigger you and it‚Äôs NOT your BPD clouding the reality, then that‚Äôs fucked up and you deserve better.

2,"I can really relate as I have been in a relationship with someone like your mom and even been like your mom or parroted those beliefs of you should be able to do things because I can. It is a highly narcissistic way of thinking. It isn't correct and the person saying that lacks empathy or can't deal with THEIR emotions. Please understand that. You are not incorrect.

In my case the person who was telling me these things I kept trying to explain to her that the more she pushed the further locked in my mental crisis prison I would get. It was horrible. I empathize so much with your pain and anger and self hatred. I tried and tried to change myself that way and its exhausting and soul crushing. 

From your post it sounds like your mom is very mentally damaging for you to be around. Is there a reason you are stuck being around her? Is there any way you can get out or away from her influence? You clearly have a lot of pain to process and this is only  making it worse. She probably will not listen to you. 


In my case the only thing that soothed that intense self loathing was that, miracle of miracles, the person who was pushing and gaslighting me ended up validating the harm they did to me apologizing and reaffirming that I did not deserve it (up to that point they insisted I deserved it). I have been locked in cycles with her for a long time. And the way out was that I swallowed my pride and apologized and took responsibility for the damage I had done her, and listened to her even though I didn't agree with her perspective, and she actually opened up about how much my behavior hurt her or just the pain she was feeling, and then I was able to follow that up by sharing the same, how much her behavior had impacted me. We still have to separate to heal and protect ourselves but I have never felt ANYTHING like that moment of validation. It showed me how powerfully mind destroying gaslighting is to someone with a vulnerable mind. I began to imagine what it would be like to be around people who did not gaslight me at all, even if I was simply alone. I imagined how different life might feel. 

It inspired me to decide with a heavy heart I have to cut off contact further with my parents if they keep gaslighting me and leave a job that is confusing where I have bad boundaries.
 I have thought I can tolerate it and explain or just put my feelings aside. But there will come a breakthrough point when you realize how much your peace matters and that nothing in the world is worth mental chaos because it will destroy your soul and everyone around you will be affected. 

All that is to say I hope you can find a way to unentangle from your mom even if you still care or love her. Don't be surprised if things begin to feel a lot different. The stuff you are saying here is very heavy and dangerous. That amount of shame and self blame will eat you alive. It isn't that you have BPD and are bad as much as your BPD may be allowing you to emotionally stay in a destructive situation.

4,"Oh no this is very clear now that you shared this information. It sounds like you are in a mind trap where she is able to exploit your guilt and shame to make you useful for herself as she probably can't face her own inability to care for herself.  

I also struggle with oversharing my issues with unfit people, an early childhood pattern. That you can recognize it is a great step. Maybe you can find another outlet or somewhere to receive validation as it seems you are experiencing a strong amount of manipulation and gaslighting yourself from her and she is projecting. If you are paying her bills and she is threatening to kill herself if you leave that is an abusive domestic situation and you may need more serious help to extract yourself don't take it lightly. There are domestic violence shelters and places that could help you begin the process when and if you are ready. 

You got this and deserve to experience a more free life no matter what you have done! Sometimes we can't help people we love except by helping ourselves.

And throw it straight into the trash along with the flowers I got her. And I haven't gotten her anything since. But, if I ever get her anything, I just detache that inner child that longs for her approval or appreciation. Just remember that you do what you can to honor her and your grandmother, and if they don't accept or appreciate it, that's on them. It has no reflection on you whether you get her anything or not. 

And for yourself, just do something you enjoy. Something that makes you happy. It doesn't have to be expensive it's just about making sure you celebrate yourself and your milestones as they come.

1,First I'm just going to say the other comment that persons an a- hole and secondly there's a reason that people with BPD and narcissists and other relationships together it's like an attraction to each other you know like one wants complete control over the other and the other has a strong fear of being abandoned so basically a narcissist can do whatever the f*** they want and that person will sit there and still love them and that's why they always end up together but what you need to focus on is yourself and not what he's doing because you know in your mind that he's just doing it to keep that control my suggestion is once you get whatever it is that's so important that you need to get from his house is that you just go no contact you guys can't be friends anymore like cuz it won't work he'll always just keep that a little bit of control over you and this cycle will just keep repeating like I'm not sure what your situation is but like if the stuff that's there is not that important then just let it go hopefully that helped,whiplash0713,18xe6w4

0,"I know how you feel. I've felt different most of my life. People generally treat me the same. Most people though just don't understand what our condition is or what we go through in our heads. Most people may try to help with certain situations but fail miserably at understanding, no matter how hard you try to explain, how you see or feel about things. But that's why communication is important. If they're willing to attempt to understand, I would try to explain it until they can at least understand even a little bit. 

Before being officially diagnosed I studied my symptoms starting back in middle school. My now deceased wife (passed of cancer) helped me a lot. She saw me at my absolute worst and still chose to be with me. I was able to talk to her about anything. It got to a point she'd be able to detect one of ""outbursts"" before it happened and helped me through. I learned a lot of coping skills and am a lot calmer of a person because of her. Currently, I have one friend I trust enough to talk to. 

If you have someone you can trust, my advise is talk to them about things. Even if all they do is listen. It helps. I've also found that being open about my condition helps me and helps others understand me. So I've recently started a podcast where I talk about my life and different situations I've been through as well as how I feel about certain topics. Even if I never grow an audience I'll continue doing the podcast because it's a way for me to get things off my chest (vent) and I'll be able to listen to episodes in the future to see how much I've changed compared to when I spoke about a situation and how I might handle it differently as opposed to when I went through it. 

I chose podcasting on purpose because I feel a blog would gain an audience faster, and whereas I do want to talk about it and put it out there, part of me is still a bit scared or nervous about how some people may view what I say. But either way, it's an outlet for me to relieve my stresses and vent; which does help.",RedConradcom,14h1jz1
1,"Hey, no matter what your symptoms and experience - you aren't alone! Remember that. 

BPD is complex, and every case is uniquely formed and expressed. People - including doctors - would often downplay my mental illness because I'm more of the ""quiet"" subtype with a high functioning presentation. It was misdiagnosed for many years because of that in combination with my not having an obvious history of abuse. But trauma is much more complicated than that. Having our mental illness and experience invalidated of course contributes to the overall issue.

If you meet the criteria, or even some of the symptoms that severely affect you, then they need to be addressed no matter what anyone thinks. No matter your situation, yes, your brain HAS been wired a certain way by your environment and experiences. And it can be rewired in time. DBT is a great place to start - if you can't do it formally, there are many books and resources online. I'd also highly recommend Dr. Daniel Fox's YouTube channel, as well as his Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook. His workbook is pretty unique compared to other ones out there; it's my favorite one I've come across. I'm going to be starting my own channel soon, but more for the peer support side and to share my personal experience with BPD and recovery - I'm not a doctor or licensed in any way and will still suggest there that people refer to his content for clinical information.

BPD is an isolating experience, but that's why peer support is so important. I haven't felt understood regarding the strength of my emotions by anyone in life besides those with similar issues. Keep reaching out. BUT be wary about info you come across, even within this subreddit. There are so many misconceptions, and they can be harmful to recovery. Have hope. I promise things won't always be as they are currently as long as you keep working towards change. 

And congrats on being free of sh for so long, that's fantastic and you should be incredibly proud of yourself!",SarruhTonin,14h1jz1

0,"I see you and I can somewhat relate. It used to be rather severe - the rage and depressive episodes consuming me because of triggers which reminded me of my perception that I have no control and these cycles keep perpetuating.

DBT is helpful but also it is all so super exhausting, that conscious constant continous inner fight. Sometimes I just want to be and sometimes I just be for 2 days too longs and then spiral with letting go of each thing and just never getting back up in weeks or months.

It now comes in for a day or two and I can recognize the early early signs. Once I do or my healthy support structure reminds me of certain things we've written down that happens, I begin to increase my selfcare practices.

Especially two things. HRB and Neurographica. They require very little effort from me and they both make a physiological difference.

I have a free app for the Heart Rhythm Breathing, so all I do is place my finger on the camera and follow the ball inflation and deflation which assists me in breathing Rhythmically. That changes my coherence, makes the nervous system counter the cortisol production. If I am declining, I fit in 4 to 5 sessions of 10 to 20 minutes in just lying down on the grass or bed whoever you are able to or sit anywhere and breath through a session focusing on getting my breathing in Rhythm.

It also shows you your HRV (Heart rate variability) scores which can tell you how depressed and far gone you are and will start picking up the deeper you're able to hold your Rhythms.

Check out Dr Alan Watkins he explains about HRV Rhythm breathing and coherence with regards to performance, but it can be used like this.

Neurographica is also absolutely wonderful and a proven therapy method by Pavel Pascarev that Stimulates the brains neuroplasticity and helps with rewiring.

They've been saving my life, especially is those times when I feel like I just cannot! It's easy, it does not require big effort from me and it is something I can do anywhere on my phone and if practiced enough without anything and as that begins making a difference in my energy and reasoning brain, I regain the ability to do the other practices, like go back to the gym or get some sun and take daily walks, listen to good hormone inducing music etc.

I hope you can find the tools that work for you.üôè",barely_parenting,ywe7vy
0,"I haven't cried this hard in a few months. I had to let go of my partner. When I say that, I mean I have BPD, C-PTSD, MDD, and DID. The second my partner joined that subreddit, it was just a slow decline. There were other factors. But ever since then, it's like, in his mind, everything I do is to try and manipulate him. Or play victim. It's like I went from his partner to his enemy in a matter of days. Do your best to get him into an actual support group for loved ones of BPD. Because 97% of the post on that subreddit is just negative. There is nothing about supporting each other. Or their spouse or how to deal with the stress and feelings of overwhelming helplessness and resentment that build trying to support or love someone with this condition in a healthy way. 

But I saw him pulling away. And I didn't just split. I tried to talk things out. I talked to my therapist and psychologist. In my case, they came to the conclusion that his expectations of the quality of progress I was making wasn't enough for him. And he was likely to break up with me. I didn't let that break me. Like I always did in the past. I focused on my therapy and God. Continued to work on myself. And is it at times the most miserable, painful experience of my life. Not being with him.. 

Not texting. Or calling him on his lunch break to hear how his day is going. Going to his house and playing minecraft. Listening to songs in the car and holding hands. Watching him play video games with his friends or learning about code. Seeing the smile on his face when he figures out how to solve a problem. The way he scrinches up his face when people say things he thinks is ignorant. Or the cute way he talks to his cats. I miss him every  second of every minute of every hour of every day, weeks, and months we have been apart.

 And he did ask for a break. And we are on this very long break it's been 5 months. We hardly ever talk. Or text or meet up. When we do talk, we argue. But, we almost always say I love you when we hang up. And I know he's trying to work on himself.  And so am I. I'm doing everything I can to move forward. To continue fighting  those waves that try to take me under, I say all this not to scare you. But, because as much as I miss him. I know this is what he needed. And what I needed. I know we wouldn't have BPD if doing this was easy. And if the pain we experience wasn't almost impossible to bear at the thought or realization that we are going to lose someone you love. But, this is about being able to face you fears over and over again. There are gonna be days that you lose, but you can't keep letting that fear control your life. Or it will keep trying to kill you. Until it succeed.

Every time I stand up to face my fears, it gets just a little bit easier. Because you'll slowly start to realize you can do it. You start to trust in your ability to adapt and rise to the occasion. 

One scariest things for me is the unknown. 

Things I don't know: 
AM I  Unloveable?
Am I damaged beyond repair?
What will I do if he leaves for good?
Can I do this on my own?..
Will I ever heal from my abuse?
Can I ever truly forgive my family 
Forgive My rapists?..

I don't know. 
But as I work on myself. And very slowly heal from my past. And unlearn my bad habits, negative thinking, and self sabotage. Learning how to listen to myself and my desires.Learning who I am. Building real love and compassion for myself. The unknown is now know. No not everything but a few things on that list I finally know the real answer.

Something I realized when I started loving myself. Is I can't be unlovable like my mother said if I love myself.  I can't be unlovable if God loves me. And being alone isn't the worst thing you could be. Trust me when I say this it's gonna be hard. But not impossible. If you have the will there is a way through it. God will come through for you like he's always done for me. Not always in the way we want. But if you put your trust in him that he will help you. All you need is the will and the faith to trust him to lead you through the dark into the light. You'll come out of this better than before. And you'll get all the comfort you'll ever need. And if you where to lose your way again you'll know he's right there with you. Waiting for you to take his hand. Never ever leaving your side.

1,"You are right. You are NOT a monster. YOU‚Ä¶ ARE‚Ä¶ NOT‚Ä¶ A‚Ä¶ MONSTER. You are the result of what happens when a person is mistreated or abused by their parents or another adult. My heart bleeds for you. 

My husband works hard to understand me. I know that if he fell into a group like that he would quickly see that it was not productive and simply BPD bashing and he would seek a better group. 

But here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ we are the victims of our abusive parents, but our loved ones can become victims of BPD through its manifestation in us. They need help to get through this, too. It is unfortunate that groups can get like that but I guarantee there are other options for him. Whether they are here on Reddit or in an actual face to face support group or even individual counseling. They need help. Don‚Äôt catastrophize‚Ä¶ fix it. 

Tell him your concerns and have ready a list of options you feel would actually be helpful to him because you care about HIM and not just your relationship or losing him. And if you are not in couples counseling please, by all means, consider getting into it. It has helped me and my husband tremendously for each of us to see through each other‚Äôs eyes and understand what is needed. And when it isn‚Äôt clear, our trained therapist who knows a lot about BPD helps us figure it out. 

Whatever you do, do not let yourself go down the path of self loathing and wanting to give up. Anyone who has BPD knows exactly what that means as we have all been there. DO NOT GO THERE. You are strong enough to have gotten this far through abusive parents and now through BPD affected relationships. You can get through this as well. 

You are worthy of love and the most effective place to get that is in yourself. I know how cliche that can sound and how hard it can be for us to even know what that looks like, but loving yourself means taking care of yourself. It means sometimes simply closing your eyes in a quiet space and imagining that hurt child whose caretakers failed to protect her and were even the ones who hurt her. Wrap your arms around her and tell her you know she wasn‚Äôt protected. You know she was hurt by those who were supposed to love her, but YOU are here now and YOU will protect her. You will provide for her and you will love her. Because she deserves love and you deserve love. Period. 

The sooner your little girl inside begins to feel safe and loved by you, the sooner she (and you) can heal. 

Do it right now. If you‚Äôre at work, go to your car. If you‚Äôre at home, take a break in a quiet room. I personally like to take a warm bath and turn off the lights and put on some white noise or some healing kind of music with no words so I can focus. And do this for you. Do this for her. TALK TO HER. Console her. 

Because she is not a monster and neither are you.",Overall_Interview441,1cxwlef

0,"Tbh if you don't have emotional disregulation it sounds like you might need to talk to your doctor about your diagnosis because that's the main issue with BPD. Perhaps they saw something in you that you haven't recognized, or perhaps they're wrong.

Also saying people with BPD quit their job because their bosses ""are mean to them"" sounds kind of disingenuous. Lots of people struggle with keeping jobs because they have a lot of bad mental health days and can't make it to work during crises, or for other reasons. Lots of people with BPD don't have trouble keeping a job, either. It's different for everyone and using language that implies immaturity is a bit insulting. 

Anyways, maybe see a different doctor if you feel this one just kind of pinned the label because they couldn't think of anything better.

I will say that not all people with BPD have emotional trauma, it's just really common in people who have emotional trauma. You don't need to fit every symptom to have a mental illness.",Cobalt-Royal,ujabxw
1,"I have very strong interpersonal issues and am very clingy. People cut me off a lot and I seek revenge often, if not always. I have intense impulsivity issues.  I physically cannot be alone and have that problem of having no interests and being always bored when I am alone. That was allegedly enough to clear the bar for BPD. 

The shrink diagnosed me after a few questionnaires, a chat with an ADHD specialist and 2 hours. I asked her at the last session (I believe the 9th or 10th) if she still stuck with her diagnosis, she said yes. She also tagged along ""possibly-clinical depression"" for good measure.

If I said something tactless, I apologize. I'm just trying to transpire my thoughts and feelings and apprehensions as concisely as possible.",JeanPaulItsArt,ujabxw
2,"That's fair. I'm also being a bit hard on you. Having a new diagnosis is always really hard, too.

Let's look at some questions regarding emotional disregualtion, because everything else does sound like BPD, but at the same time, it can always be due to other causes.

Maybe think these over and see if things start falling into place for you or if the BPD diagnosis still seems wrong ro you:

Have you asked anyone in your friends or family if they've noticed you have strong emotions?

How often do you lose your temper?

How often do you yell?

How often do you cry?

Do you get really excited about stuff to the point where you're yelling or jumping around?

How many times do you switch moods throughout the day? My neurotypical partner once told me he's usually in the same mood throughout the entire day and I was shocked. I have BPD and yeah. Different mood like... every hour? Every few hours? But each person is different. Like lots of neurological people can be moody.

Why do you think people cut you off?

In what ways do you seek revenge? I'm going to go ahead and say that's not a very healthy way of doing things. Doesn't necessarily say you have BPD but it does sound like it's related to a possible mental health issue.

These aren't necessarily ways to diagnose yourself or undiagnose yourself. They're just exploratory questions for you to see if you can understand yourself a bit more. But maybe they'll help you understand your doctor or dispute them if needed.

Hope this helps!",Cobalt-Royal,ujabxw
3,"Ha, the diagnosis is from 2019. I just kinda left it on hold since then.

I dont have many moods. Just ""normal"" and ""I cant di anything or function"". They switch unpredictably 

I lose my temper unpredictably, but not often, and it often seems like a conscious decision

I can get excited and jumpy sometimes, yeah, but not often. 

I dont cry but I am a wreck in the second mood. They dont switch regularly, again, it takes a trigger to switch.

People cut me off because I just am not really attractive to people or interesting. I wrote a very long description of how this happens if it would provide more context",JeanPaulItsArt,ujabxw

0,"I have BPD and can relate. If we were to dig deeper, instead of it sounding black and white, problem solving entails not over generalizing I've learned (which people with BPD famously do). So the more accurate question I'd say is, ""What does it mean to deserve something?""

I feel having a life partner is one piece of the pie of being whole. Intimacy is a basic human need because we are social creatures.",,h8geym
1,"Hey, my take on this is that you completely can be in a relationship. But hold out for a really special person, they must be compassionate and kind, understanding and have a gentle and loving nature. I‚Äôve spent the last 15 years consecutively in and out of relationships with very little time being single. A bad/toxic/unhealthy relationship really exasperates my symptoms and behaviours and can really set you back in learning how best to cope and manage your bpd. 

My advice is to learn your triggers, identify the parts of you that are hurt, and allow yourself to feel worthy of love as an imperfect person. It is only now that I am in a loving and healthy relationship that I have learnt and realised that a being in a relationship is not the be all and end all but that I‚Äôm worthy of love ‚ù§Ô∏è",,h8geym

Why have you decided to discuss it with your work? 
How do you plan to go about it? 
How do you hope people react? 

I‚Äôm very curious how it will go, but I wish you best of luck.",bansheespirit,chgaqw
1,"I know what you mean when you say ""I always thought it would make others view meas less capable.."".          
 That thought did run through my mind. If I tell them what I experience will it make them walk on egg shells around me or make me seem unstable as an employee? Reason 1.) Personally I want mental illnesses to be openly discussed and to have more awareness surrounding them so there is no stigma. Reason 2.) I leave work sometimes. I have all sorts of panic/ anxiety attacks that unfortunately can dictate my behavior and that effects my job. 

 The reason I want to openly share with my work is probably because my job is a very ""family vibe"" and open about our personal struggles. We try and ask each other at the beginning of the week, ""What you need to know to be able to work with me."" Which gives us the chance to say things like ""My cat got sick this past weekend and I am very anxious about the whole process. So if I seem off with you all at work, that's why."" 

This idea to open up is still in the beginning stages of how I want to go about it because I don't want to make things worse. But at the same time, why not tell them? I am not ashamed of my BPD. It has caused me a lot of pain, confusion, and perseverance. 

How has that made you feel to keep your BPD ""hush hush"" with your parents?",mommasaidnoEm,chgaqw
2,"I like your reasons and I admire your courage to be one of the few confident enough to be open about mental health struggles in the work place. I love when people pave the way for others so they feel comfortable doing the same if they so choose. 

You are lucky to have the support system you do, it seems as though they will try to understand and relate to you as best as they can which is all we can ask for.  

I am glad you felt comfortable sharing such personal effects with those you love. I wish you the very best. 

To answer your question, growing up in a home where issues were better ignored than dealt with, there were a lot of unresolved feelings for most of my life; 
I never believed I was cared for and I lived under the impression I deserved to suffer in silence in order to maintain my mothers perfect image in the society. It‚Äôs still difficult to this day but it is what it is.",bansheespirit,chgaqw
0,"I'm looking from the outside and I'm male and bloody old so sorry I don't fit what you want and I completely understand wanting to speak to someone similar to you. I have been in a relationship with someone who suffered a lot, various attempts to end it, plus they suffered from DID as well as PTSD.

Deep breath.

You need to vent a bit somewhere safe. Even the odd primal scream in the woods might make you feel a bit better, not a cure but it might take the steam out a bit.

Other than that you really need someone to talk to where any fear of hospitalisation isn't present. No friends that might be that non-judgemental ear? Depending on where you are there are also some good help lines or PTSD charities that might be a good ear too.

The ideation to end it? Of course, I might be taking a risk here but I see that as a normal part of the process of being you. It doesn't always last and is really driven by a deep desire to NOT be you and you can only say that because of the memories you have that are negative. Again completely understandable. Just be aware that it can spiral downwards as a repetitive thought. That's very exhausting to have those thoughts every time you feel triggered or down.

Here's one key that applies to people having too many thoughts creating a desire to control or suppress them. Suppressing them can be the problem more than those thoughts actually exist being the problem. The tremendous desire to suppress them is probably more exhausting than having the thoughts in the first place! In other words, those thoughts are stressful when you're inside of them. They seem real and valid. If you manage to find a moment of peace and suddenly those thoughts come, look at them as if they are just a machine working in your head to try and make yourself feel in control. Let it go. It's going to happen anyway. The thoughts will come, and they will go. Allow them to go even if they seem stubborn and are sticking around. Put them in a place where you realise they are not who you really are. They are like a machine kicking off when the on button has been pushed. Kind of like a knee jerk reaction of the brain. You can practice this every day just by being aware of it rather than trying to control it. Be aware of it but it's really just babble in the background.

There is another part of you that isn't this. A deep and relevant part that can access something else other than thinking about bad thoughts.

With the PTSD you can try some of the trusted and true methods that bring your attention to the things around you. When you feel yourself going into a PTSD mode do things like look at the walls and their colour. Describe the light in the room. Use sensing as a way to connect with the reality of where you are rather than the thoughts in your head. Run cold water over your hands is another good one. It focuses your brain on the relevant and immediate world.

Much love.",NeerImagi,17yxzr7
0,"You sound pretty isolated. It might be difficult but are there friends, support groups, or clubs around your interests you could start attending? Before your partner is unavailable?
Diversifying resources is a great way to help wean off that energy we depend on our FP for. Even if you feel restless, dissatisfied or unhappy around everyone else but them, just trying to get out the door or into a discord server and chat and check in with other people could help. You don't have to be totally alone.",oisin_berry,vhwiek
1,"Keep looking for a therapist if you can, it really is super helpful to have a good therapist. I always suggest finding a new therapist if the one you have isn't helping, as well. I went through several but have found one that has helped me make leaps and bounds of improvement. It's worth it. 

I have been in a similar place to you before where I *needed* to be talking to my FP at all times or I'd lose it. Time with your FP can be very addictive and right now you're taking that drug like a junkie. Try to wean yourself off time talking to your FP slowly to prepare for the coming change. Communicate openly with your FP about your plan, why you're doing it, and ask their help with slowly reducing communication time. Find out what kind of communication time you'll have after their job moves back to the office, and make that amount the goal for you to reduce down to. Look for ways to stay occupied when you're not talking to your FP. Maybe think of ways to surprise them when you do get to talk to them next. Perhaps if you're artistically inclined you could work on art as a gift for your FP. 

It's hard, but I believe in you. You'll feel a lot more functional and whole and when you are more independent you will have a more healthy relationship that you can feel extra proud of. 

I'm also in an LDR and it's been hard especially since you can't see your partner in real life but it's really valuable to me to still have a healthy relationship and when I do get to talk to him I have a whole day's worth of events to tell him all about!",sparrowlion,vhwiek

3,"I also have awful memory issues, that I think have slowly gotten worse over the years (I was diagnosed 6 years ago). It's gotten to the point where I have been considering mentioning it to a doctor but I have also adapted a lot of things around it. Such as putting EVERYTHING in my calender on my phone, setting reminders for just about everything, writing stuff down where possible (and making sure they're in plain sight) etc. 

Stuff I mostly struggle with is who I told what (meaning I repeat myself a lot, I usually start stories with ""Did I tell you about x?"" To avoid that), keeping up with friends (sometimes weeks will go by without hearing from them but it'll feel like yesterday - I try to check my chats regularly for people I haven't caught up with in a while,  I never get movie/ show referances even when I've seen it multiple times (and if I haven't seen something in a while it's like watching it for the first time, only upside I see here lol), forgetting to feed my cats (don't worry, they remind me), forgetting to eat myself, or forgetting to take my meds, or doing those last 2 twice because I forget I already did them. 

There's probably a lot more, but I'm also crap at remembering stuff to give examples xD

Setting routines for stuff you forget has also been helpful for me

7,"So w/ the amnesia thing. Are you saying amnesia dissociation is a thing? Or are you saying that as two seperate things? If so it sounds like I could possibly have that. I relate to literally every memory issue you just listed on there. Esp when you said ""you don't remember places you've been to."" I went to SC beaches many years when I was young. I""m only 19 now but I stopped going when I was ;probably about 7 years old. As much as I loved that place, there are certain details of the area I just can't remember. Like for ex, my mom mentioned that there is this one shop that we pass by all the time on this street, she even remembers the street name, but I don't. And maybe part of it was because I was young and wasn't paying attention to things like that, but you would think if we've been to the same beach area quite a few times I would've at least remembered what the shop building looked like but I don't. But she was talking to me about it because we were thinking about going back this year and she asked if I remember the shop and what it looked like and I just for the life of me couldn't remember. And the same thing will happen for college/school related things. I'll study for tests all day, and then can't remember a thing I studied the day of the test. And while keeping in mind even tho I only studied a couple of days, at least that's what usually happens, I would still think I would be able to remember at least a little bit. And I think part of the issue is I stay up all the night before, or the night before that sometimes it would be two or three nights in a row pulling an all nighter because I have really bad time management skills, but anyways, I would stay up all night then I would be so tired the next morning and my brain was probably so tired that I just couldn't remember anything which is really frustrating esp if the quiz/test/exam is a big part of your grade which that happened to me several times through my last fall semester. Which is why I had to drop out. But what is dissociative insomnia? I haven't heard of that. Since you haven't heard of it, if you want I can't ask my therapist or psychiatrist about that.

9,"Well that might be a trauma response. My therapist talked to me about trauma responses last Friday and that's what that sounds like. If you did have abuse during your childhood, your probably trying to co er it up. I think it's your brain's way of a coping w/ the trauma is what I'm trying to get at. I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure that's what that is because that's how my therapist described what was going on w/ me. And you may have PTSD too because my therapist really does think I have that as we discussed last Friday as well. I say you might have PTSD because I know that is very much related to trauma response. I""m not trying to diagnose you wrongly, or just diagnosing you but it ius a suggestion tho. If you have a therapist/psychologist/psychatrist I would highly suggest bringing that up to them because when I brough it up it prety much clicked right away w/ my therpaist on why I was doing the things I was doing.",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e

So my therapist always ask if my dad and I or if my sister and I have had any arguments/fights/blow ups this week on Friday and I can never remember because I block it out. She told me that was most likely a coping mechanism thing. So that's probably what your doing too and you're probablt doing it unconscioulsy because I know I do it unconciously. And I'll forget so often that it'll be like ten mins after the argument even tho I'm still mad/frustrated whatever the negative feeling is, I'll ususally text my bf about it and I can't even remember all of the details of why I was mad in the first place.",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e
11,"Thank you! This was helpful knowing someone can relate to the issues I'm having. I also agree my memory is getting pretty terrible and the worst part about it is I'm only 19 and I have plenty of more years to go and I don't want it almost half gone by the time I'm in my 20's or 30's. I've mentioned it to my psychologist (or therapist? I've always been confused about what to call her) but anyways, she thinks its something related w/ BPD and I wouldn't be surprised either. I'll have to do some looking around to see if people w/ BPD have similar issues. But from the examples you gave literally EVERYTHING on this list I relate too. I hardly remember to feed my cat and the bad thing is she doesn't remind me when she needs to be fed. Thankfully my mom is there to help out w/ that part. But w/ other things, I try putting things down in my planner for college stuff that didn't work so I switched to setting reminders on my iPad/phone and that still didn't work because I have an issue where I ignore the reminder. It's like I see it so I acknowledge to myself that I see it but then I slide the notification up and then I end up either completely forgetting about it or not remembering until the night of when the assignment/paper and/or test/quiz/exam was due. Which can be extremely frustrating esp if it heavily impacts your grade. My therapist is usually good w/ coming up w/ solutions to my issues but this one we've been struggling w/ for quite a while. It would also happen during hs which is partially the main reason why I almost didn't graduate and I honestly probably wouldn't have if it weren't for my amazing counselor that I had there. But for the communicating w/ friends/family or just people that I'm close to I also have the same issue of ""Did I tell you about the time... or did I tell you this already?"" It's very frustrating and I feel bad for the person esp if I've said it a million times which will happen very often too. Although most of the people who I'm close w/ or talk to often have gotten used to it by now and know that I have this disorder so they're pretty understanding about it THANK GOD for that lol.  But for that situation I'm almost starting to wonder if I should write down the important stuff that I either want to tell, or have already told them so I don't have to constantly repeat myself. I also tend to forget things about important people esp when it comes to someone I'm dating. I'm trying my best atm not to forget the important things about the current bf that I have so I'm thinking I should write these things down. But I still have no solution for the college issue which sucks.",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e
12,"Thank you that means a lot!! And yes I know how you feel, it's weird like I said above this response, I'll block out fights and what not but I'll remember most of the negative things that happen in my childhood. Whenever I meet someone new, and most of the time I do this w/ a guy, and they ask me to tell me about myself, or what my life's story is, I always hate that question because there were so many stressful things that happened, most of them pretty traumatic unfortunately, and I always feel like that's all I can say my life was as a child and is now which really sucks I wish I could come up w/ something different but it's always so hard to.",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e
13,"Yea my exes would use that against me as well. Although of course I can't think of any examples where he used to do that to me but I know basically all of them but one did that to me. It was really frustrating. And when I was in school, all throughout grade school I would have a small friend group, all of them were girls, and they would talk during lunchtime or recess, and I would always zone out of the conversation because they would talk amongst themselves and they would never talk to me. I can't even think of one time where they actually sat down and had a real conversation w/ me which is pretty sad. And the only time it happened was when me and my best friend were alone at the lunch table and everyone else was absent or taking a test or doing whatever. But anyways something funny would happen and I would always ask what's so funny? and then because I would zone out I wouldn't remember what they said and they would always say the same shit to me, ""oh it's nothing, or nevermind"" and that pissed the lving daylights out of me. I was so angry and furious when they did that to me. And now my sister does that same sort of bs to me and because that's happened to me when I was younger I act like it's a big deal because it technically is since people did that to me, but she never understands no matter how many times my mom explains it to her. My mom used to do that as well but she doesn't anymore now because I told her what happened a couple of years ago and she understands why I act like that now. But my family does it to me too (family outside of intermediate family) and I don't talk to them about any mental health issues I have except for my cousin, well my one cousin.

I always claimed that those types of skills never really worked for me. But I thought that because I was actually afraid it wouldn‚Äôt work. I didn‚Äôt really know if it would work or not cause I never really tried it.

I paid for a subscription to it and then I checked it out cause I thought it was like a brain workout type of app but it was just the meditation stuff and at the time I wasn‚Äôt into meditation.

0,"I was diagnosed on paper with Borderline Traits at 14 yrs old, but the psychologist that had done my full psychological evaluation told my caretaker and I that he had no doubt that even at 14 I had the full disorder, but he said he couldnt put a full BPD diagnosis on paper/record until I turned 18, for patients under 18 years old they diagnose it as Borderline Traits. But my psychologist explained BPD and how it forms in terms 14 year old me would understand and I have yet to come across a better way to explain it on my opinion. He put it like this:

There is a childhood trauma, picture that is a splinter in your foot. And the childs environment is not emotionally validating and toxic, so the trauma is never processed through so it just festers and builds and keeps getting worse as time passes. So you get this splinter in your foot right? Trauma, particularly childhood trauma. Well then you dont take care of that blister, dont wash it or cover it or remove it, nothing. And you go walking around everywhere barefoot in dirty, unclean places okay? Emotionally invalidating and toxic environment. Well one day that splinter gets severely infected, swollen and hot and red with infectious puss. He said the splinter is the trauma, and the surrounding sore redness and infection is the BPD that developed. I am in no way saying one way or another as to if she might or might not have anything.  That is for a trained mental health professional to deside. That is the one and only way to have any idea what state her behavioral health is really in.

1,"BPD is a sadly stigmatized disorder, and it's disappointing that professional bias is a real thing.

If you're struggling with PTSD symptoms like flashbacks and dissociation, EMDR could be a highly effective treatment. One challenge in treating BPD for someone who has post trauma responses is ""staying present"" during treatment; trauma therapy like EMDR usually includes practicing skills specifically to help that.",TranZeitgeist,fu914t
2,"Usually for people with BPD the best course of action is to do DBT and get to a stable place and then do EDMR or other trauma work if its applicable (it sounds like it is). DBT is kinda like crisis management skills so you can tolerate the every day, and once you get that under control it's much easier to work on the less fun stuff. Doing any kind of work with trauma isn't something you want to start if you aren't at a stable place because it's a really difficult process and it can bring up old wounds and make you worse before it makes you better. You want to be able to cope with that before you bring it all up. 

I'm sorry that your therapists are being difficult. It's so frustrating how stigmatized BPD is unfortunatley. I don't know if your diagnosis is already officially on your file, if it's not, it may be prudent to delay mentioning BPD until a few sessions into treatment. Therapists without much  experience often have stereotyped images of a disaster client when they hear borderline. And honestly it may be best to look for a therapist without such views. As much as it sucks to be turned away by therapists, if someone thinks they wont be able to treat you properly, them not treating you is in your best interest.   

If you can, look for a therapist that does DBT because more than likely they will be willing and used to dealing with patients with BPD. A therapist with a trauma background is also ideal, and they usually go hand in hand.",,fu914t

Be careful where you dig on the internet as there are a lot of people who cast us as 'evil' or 'manipulative' and conflate that with a BPD thing. Since many of us with BPD have experienced abuse and have had to adapt coping skills, some people unintentionally pickup bad behaviors from partners as a coping skill or learn behaviors to survive that may come across as manipulation.  


Also very important to note, stating your needs and asking others to help you be safe and comfortable and to have those needs met is not manipulation.

But meditation has been helping me a lot with letting things go and reviving the loving and supportive energy I know he needs. The more I educate myself and try to put my self love first. The quicker he diffuses and apologizes. I also try not to let him dwell in shame but rather to focus on solutions when he‚Äôs out of the fog. So I‚Äôm trying to become an example rather than try and fix him. It takes a lot of the pressure off of him which I feel can trigger the episodes.

Also setting space while reassuring him I‚Äôm not leaving him helps. I know it hurts to reads those posts misinformed folks express.

I realize the seriously problematic issues of cluster b's, especially in relation to crime with sociopathy. Obviously not everyone with it is a criminal or violent person, but it is a concern.

However, most of them have been played up by media portrayals and people who assume their loved ones are the only example of people with bpd ever. It's tiring. I have ""quiet"" bpd, so people just think I'm naive and younger than I am... Until they really get to know me. Not that many people do. I'm careful about getting close to others.

It kills me that people will advocate for ""mental illness"" - - i.e. Anxiety and depression, until they are blue in the face. But other conditions, that are often comorbid conditions are overlooked and demonized.

9,"I didn't mean to make it sound that way.

What i was trying to say was that people with bpd can be abusive as much as anyone else can.

Pointing fingers at people with bpd is not helpful for either side as it enables harmful stereotypes, and making the coping with the trauma about the abuser is simply not a good way to cope. There's a reason trauma therapy exists and there's a reason why victims of abuse are not split up into groups by the mental health problems of their abuser. And there is a reason trauma therapy groups are led by professionals. 

If you want to simply be informed about why people with bpd share certain behaviours, looking in a subreddit that makes the abuse about the mental illness of the abuser the core of the sub, will not be helpful but harmful. In many cases, the victims will share their own personal view, which aren't accurate to the mental illness sometimes but to their abuser. Looking for information in a place where many people gather who are struggling with trauma unsupervised, will not make anyone informed. 

You're right, being abusive is not right. Neither is labeling a group of people as abusers because they have the same mental illness
And many of the people i have seen on the subreddit simply need trauma therapy with professional supervision, to understand that coping with trauma is about you and not about the abuser
Sorry for the confusion I'm having trouble to put into words what i mean when i get heated in the brain (also im not native English speaker so some of the things i say might sound weird) 

Anyway tl;dr 
It's not okay to abuse anyone 
It's not okay to reduce a person to their mental illness
Coping with trauma should be supervised by professionals 
People who were traumatised by someone with a mental illness shouldn't give advice about how to handle a person with the same mental illness 
People with mental illness shouldn't be reduced to the mental illness

0," i have BPD i‚Äôm not proud to admit I was abusive to my SO at one point in time. i want to tell you it does get better but YOU have to make it better, be mindful. Self Awareness is a big step in controlling your emotions & episodes when you have an episode try looking from a 3rd person POV ‚Äî i realized how crazy & selfish i looked screaming at my boyfriend how pathetic he was & then getting in his face even more for not responding to such abusive language. 
Who tf would want to be with someone who degrades and disrespects them? 
A lot of the things I said I later realized that i was projecting my own pain & insecurity on him. 


When you get mad ask yourself, before you think of getting upset with her (or anyone.) Take a sec, ask yourself why am I mad? 

Is this anything to be upset about? 
What can I do to redirect my energy into something productive? 
How do I say what I feel without attacking my partner?

Don‚Äôt always expect an answer from your partner, expressing emotions can be venting, if you want them to respond let them know before hand ‚ÄúI want your advice on something that‚Äôs bothering me‚Äù or if you want to vent ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been really bothered I‚Äôd like to vent if you could just listen‚Äù 

when i find myself in a rage I would start to label things around me, if i‚Äôm driving I will say 
‚Äúblue car with a shitty paintjob passing to my left‚Äù ‚Äúpedestrian walking not looking where they‚Äôre going‚Äù & so on. 
This way you hijack your brain ...getting you out of your emotional thinking & more into your logical thinking 

Also try to come to terms with whatever you have been hurt by in the past, a lot of my abusiveness cane from my childhood & repeating what i knew.  After accepting that I don‚Äôt have a stable family relationship I was able to forgive my family and let go of my anger to them, because trying to justify the hurt you feel from the past is not healthy & the mindset of ‚Äúthis is all i know‚Äù 
will destroy you & future relationships

To be honest, I can‚Äôt even imagine life without them. They make me better. Why would I stop taking something that makes me better? Work on removing that medication stigma, and try to accept that medication can be a good thing.

Everyone is having a horrible time at the moment, and I think it‚Äôs especially hard for those of us with mental illness to endure. We‚Äôre lonely, claustrophobic, anxious, and some of our coping strategies have been removed. It‚Äôs natural that you‚Äôre feeling extra poorly at the moment. Let yourself accept that things are going to be really rubbish for a little while, but don‚Äôt forget that this will end. And you will have good days again.

There‚Äôs also a programme here called STEPPS which is used for those with PDs who aren‚Äôt as far into their recovery.

1,"Join support groups, keep up with forums like this, research even more into it for your own good and peace of mind. 

Growing up and before getting diagnosed with my own stuff, I really enjoyed researching the shit out of things that interested me. Mental health being one of them. I knew something was up with me very early on and THANK GOODNESS for the internet because before all this met neutrality went down and internet life was actually bearable and relatively ‚Äúfresh‚Äù, I was able to explore my mind and wackiness through research and actually allowing myself to feel and think the things I did. I just didn‚Äôt tell anyone. I‚Äôd read, watch videos, and ask google more and more to kinda get a sense of what I was going through, for my own peace of mind... because if I at least understood and accepted what I was going through, than that‚Äôs okay and enough. Because no one actually knows what we‚Äôre thinking or feeling unless we physically and vocally do so.. 

It became my own sacred secret. And that was okay and is okay for me because I also learned fairly quickly that the human condition alone is a very complex one, let alone one that is naturally made with an imbalance (which is also okay), so I‚Äôd just have to make sure that I was keeping it in check the best way that I could without letting fear, shame or guilt get in the way. 

Granted, that‚Äôs a bit harder now with having to grow up and transition to full blown adulthood. But it‚Äôs a great concept and sort of ‚Äúlight‚Äù to look to. You are who you are because that‚Äôs how youre biologically made. But you get to decide how you treat yourself and how you want to show up in your life, day to day. Even if it‚Äôs something unique each day. Just as long as you  work towards building a balance, a blue print to how you yourself need to survive and thrive. 

That includes letting go and REALLY not giving a fuck about what people think about you. Do what‚Äôs right for you so long it doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone or offend anyone. 

Honor yourself. Love yourself with your flaws and all. Because at the time of death that is all we have, ourselves. 

You have FULL reign over your body. Over your mind. Over your heart. Just because it‚Äôs been a tough fight, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre going to lose. 

Idk if you watch Naruto or anime at all, but if there‚Äôs one think I‚Äôve gotten so far from Naruto is that each day, each moment brings a new challenge. Whether it be mental, physical or spiritual. Whether we‚Äôre ready or not, equipped enough or not. The important part is to show up and fight. Give your best and your all, regardless if you win or lose. 

Life is a win/lose game. It‚Äôs a matter of what we learn from it and how we use it to keep going. Because dude, as crazy as some days may feel living with this, we also experience some pretty dope amazing things! That wouldn‚Äôt be the same if we were normal! 

Kinda like Hannah Montana too üòÇ best of both worlds! 

Make the most out of it love! Even if it hurts like fucking hell sometimes. It‚Äôs okay. We don‚Äôt like a lot of thing, but we still get through it because we have to. 

Don‚Äôt be afraid or ashamed. You‚Äôre you and you are trying! And that is enough!

Also, don‚Äôt give up on trying to find a good match in terms of healthcare and therapy. I‚Äôve yet to find a good match, and even though it‚Äôs made things relatively worse in some aspects, I don‚Äôt wanna give up. And you shouldn‚Äôt either. You deserve to live a full life.",betsyletsy,fxe0xe

0,"Ok you've said a lot here, but what I heard is you don't like being alone and don't like yourself very much. I am trying alone time for like 10 minutes at a time. Trying to work up to 20, then 30. I can go to the store alone and shit like that but being straight ass alone....I don't handle it well. I do shit like compulsively pluck my eyebrows when I'm not using. So we want to be sober, healthy and independent, all the good progress you've made, it's still there, you accomplished things okay, you might be down playing it too a degree and focusing on only the negative. But, you are codependent like I am, and I took all obsessed with my fiance. We have a very healthy relationship tho, has boundaries and always checks in with me to keep me in the know. Like everything. Maybe if yours was willing to do that more and tell you ahead of time about things hes even considering doing you might take it better. Do you have a pet to cuddle? That might help. My therapist has said the best with this we can do is keep my self care at 110 percent. Like everything from diet, journaling, exercising, tooth care, sobriety, making my medications on time and shit like that, PLUS writing down a list of my accomplishments then adding to it daily. Things like taking a shower count okay. If you get the balls up to actually take a shower, brush your teeth and put on face cream.... That's an accomplishment bc if your like me you don't really feel like it. So knowing you can so more than you think, and it's tangibly down on paper like that's something you read, and touch and know it's real and that to me it's comforting. 

I'm sorry we are like this and don't like being alone. It sucks. Something else that helps me is listening to therapy videos online. Dr. Fox. Dr. K. Katie Morton. MedCircle. Well these have helped me tremendously. And I will start writing and end up writing for 2 hours. Plus I like to take notes on the therapist shit I listen to. We don't want to overwhelm our SO with the, ""your going to leave me, ""I'm not good enough, ""why are you with me, ""you'll find someone better without BPD"".... All that shit.... White it down. It's a feeling and every thought we have is just a thought, a cognitive distortion really. So know it's not true at times and that the feelings will pass and that your person will come back. Did this help at all, idk. If you want to talk more you can DM me. I'm 38f, in weekly therapy, spend allot of time on YouTube therapy and in my work books, I want to get better, I have a lot to say, and I am not employed right now. I'd be happy to talk.

1,"I'm going to cry:"") thank you so so much for taking time to write all of this! You helped me a lot to realise some things and confirm myself that writing is the best alternative to escape and express my feelings. I have to admit that I no longer go to therapy and it's been a whole year that I only do homeotherapy (so I don't talk regularly to someone I just take the medication and that's it). Mostly because I don't have the money to do both and I haven't found someone that we match or understands me yet. I know a pet would help me so much but I just can't be that responsible for another being. We have cats tho outside and I have a family dog I take it to the forest in my hometown and it really helps me being alone. I will definitely start writing more because I think that's one reason that  I felt fed up last night. I couldn't handle it all inside no more. I will check the therapists you told me thanks! thing is tho that I used to love being alone it helped me develop myself the past 4-5 years and quarantine helped me a lot but now I'm finding myself trying to attach to people as a coping mechanism which is bad. I used to love art and many things that I did by myself. It's just this dread that my bf will leave me but yeah as you said I don't show him how in need of him I truly am he doesn't understand this anyways.

0,"You're chasing a label. Labels can be helpful for you to understand your problem. They can be helpful for other people to understand your problem. However, the box that you've been placed in by someone else is just that - it's a box. It's never usually as simple as someone having one problem and everyone's experience of mental health is unique. No two people with a labelled disorder are the same. 

Have you heard the statement ""all models are wrong, some are useful""? Well it's very true in the case of the DSM categorisations of disorders. Nobody is 100% BPD and 0% NPD because they share some traits. Nobody is 0% autistic. The DSM is actually more of a sensemaking framework than a categorisation framework. So there's not necessarily a right or wrong answer as to which pigeonhole a person fits into, it's just a way to try and make sense of the situation and help decide what to do next. 

Also, bear in mind that in a way the label gives you validation that you're right. In many cases NPD/BPD people were starved of validation from carers (especially parents) as children and many of their behaviours seek an outcome of validation, often from authority figures. Consider the idea that you could be seeking the validation of psychiatrists when actually it's more important that you recognise which patterns of thought are unhealthy and develop healthy coping strategies to manage them.

If you're being blocked from receiving treatment and going through a hard time I'm sorry for that. It can be difficult to know where to start with treatment. There are a huge number of resources online for  you to get started with helping yourself. If you're interested I can share some links. 

**TL;DR Drop the idea that a label is important unless it's stopping you from accessing treatment**",The_RealMe,gdqhxy
1,"It's great that you're getting a fresh evaluation and diagnosis, I can tell you attached you are to the label and how helpful it would feel to be validated.

Today, I would say that it is wrong and insensitive to people with a BPD diagnosis for you to claim a diagnosis you have not been given. The fact is that you might experience a different PD like OCPD or PD-NOS, it's also possible the feelings you shared are more related to other factors completely.

Good luck with the eval, you seem motivated to share and work with mental health professionals to validate your experience. Let us know how it goes",TranZeitgeist,gdqhxy
0,"I don't know that either of these 2 points will bring you real comfort but

People with borderline have had physician assisted deaths in countries where that is offered. May be no surprise.

Second is that DBT is designed to recognize that life is not always ""worth living"", and feeling as you described may be a life that's not ""worth living"" (why else would you be desperate for escape?). One point is to focus on that reality and risk , managing to cope with new tools while building the relationships, meaning and habits that can sustain a life you chose.

I can't say why your psych tells you ""you're doing well"", whether it's communication on your part, or perhaps just the limit of their validation and awareness. The fact you were previously on 5 medications at once is a small concern and maybe suggests that wasn't right care for you; in general fewer meds= better recovery for pwBPD. I can't assume you have access to other care providers or treatment programs, but possibly a higher level of care, partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient would fit; or a different treatment approach would be a better match for you. You find the group setting increases your anxiety and emotional avoidance or dissociation?

As you said, suicide hurts others, it's a painful grief, and still it's an outcome and a choice. And while you're here not choosing to die, perhaps a different team or treatment will eventually click. Do you make art or journal?",TranZeitgeist,i2asxt

3,"Hi, Thank you for your thoughtful reply. 

I think my psychiatrist thinks I'm doing well compared to how I am when I'm admitted as an inpatient. I'm not sure that's a very fair benchmark though. I feel like she thinks my current level of suffering is acceptable because it's presenting as an improvement on where I was before. But it's always going up and down and honestly, even with the few moments where my mood is at its best, it's still not worth the remaining 99% of the time which seems to range from extremely difficult to absolutely unbearable.

I wasn't able to leave the house, but now I can sometimes with immense distress and difficulty. I'm still having crazy mood swings that I can barely manage. Just because I'm not aggressively trying to kill myself all the time and dont require constant surveillance doesn't mean I'm doing better enough to be left without help. She's refusing to prescribe any more medications because of the bad reactions I've had but honestly I would try anything at this point, even more bad drug reactions if it meant that this was not the level of normal I would be settling with for the rest of my life. I just feel like as long as I'm not immediately going to kill myself, that seems to be good enough, which seems cruel and disappointing. As things are, I don't know how much longer I can survive like this. 

I cycle through these suicidal loops so often that when I come out, I know I didn't really want to die, I just wanted to know that there was a possibility of a way out. This hope is difficult to hold on to when you're constantly told to just go to therapy when it's clearly not addressing your current level of distress at all.",sarahthehumanperson,i2asxt
4,"Hi there, 
I don't want to say the cliched line 'I'm sorry you're going through that' which seems to be the standard automated response to someone sharing their pain, because it never makes me feel any better. I'll just say thank you for validating my experience and sharing yours. Sometimes things just suck and there's not a lot we can do about it. We don't need to be going through the exact same thing but just being able to be honest about how terrible things are and meeting in the middle through our mutual suffering is enough. I don't want to minimise how unique your situation is, but I will say that I definitely share a sense that I'm living purely out of obligation to my family and also that it feels pretty much impossible for me to feel any positive emotions, enjoy anything or relax completely without self-judgment, fear or paranoia setting in. I'm very inconsistent because of my moods (and I avoid interaction if I'm acutely anxious, depressed or angry), but would be happy to chat to someone with shared experience.

2,"Thanks so much :) I was honestly worried that nobody would see my post, much less respond lol. And I actually stopped working after Feb 2019 one day randomly. (I had ran out of medication and I guess my brain just kinda decided ""Nope"" and off I walked out the door :/) But, on the bright side, we are in the same boat in that regard, and it is definitely helpful to not feel alone. 
I've recently isolated myself from a lot of my friends too. I had a living situation where a friend of mine invited me to live with him and his now ex-fiancee, who was also BPD, and work with them on his family's chicken farm to make a bit of money. What started out as a fun journey with friends became an anxiety riddled walking nightmare as he turned out to be a very sly and manipulative covert sociopath. (He had gas lighted his fiancee into cutting off almost all her friends and family, blamed her and villainized her for having a UTI and asking to go to the doctor, and even blamed and publicly shamed her for being sexually assaulted, which I nearly killed him for). 
I've been slowly trying to get myself back on track as I am seven days removed from inpatient. I have one friend who I do a few activities with, and I'm already feeling that FP attachment starting to form in my brain as she recently got out of a pretty bad breakup, and we've been talking a LOT more than usual. 
It's a very odd situation for me and I find myself doing this whole ""avoidant attachment"" thing that I've heard about. (Never knew it had a name until a couple days ago lol) Shes my only non-toxic friend (I'm a black male in a small southern town where if you dont go to college, you basically work a dead end job to afford to either party, do drugs, or sell drugs) and I really fear jeapordizing that. Shes even pitched the idea of moving into a place as roommates to help with growing my independence, but that seems like even more risk of me either crossing that attachment boundary, or just cutting her off completely :/",Angel_StrongXIV,hqxymu

I mean, I'm sure it would be nice, but the emotional and spiritual connection is more of what I'm after. I only ever really become a ""horndog"" if my s/o has those needs or if it seems like that's something important to them. And I know, is not a healthy behavior, but I've been doing much much better at resisting those things. My roommate had gotten himself fired, and left me and his fiancee to work the chicken houses by ourselves, so we were literally in the same room 24/7 for like 4 months, and she had given me plenty of opportunities to move on her (and let me tell you, she was a very attractive young woman). I am pretty proud of myself for not caving. That being said, it would still be nice to just be in a nice little ""more than friends"" relationship. Just not at the expense of jeapordizing and ruining my only healthy friendship",Angel_StrongXIV,hqxymu

Friends, family; I've been keeping everyone who is close to me at a distance and out of my bubble for fear. It makes it really hard to be invested in or have any enthusiasm/desire for ""shedding"" this skin of being the oldest son who turned out a problem child and never learned to function enough on his own for his life to mean something. Since moving out of my toxic living situation with my roommate, I came back to living with my mom in this shitty little apartment and I barely leave my room, much less socialize with people. 
I've been trying to conceal it since I've been back from inpatient, but I've been having lots of implosive breakdowns in secret, and have been terrified of telling anyone about them or how I'm feeling for fear of A) Overwhelming them and smothering them with my need for affection and stability, and B) Being sent back into the inpatient program, where they would most likely change my diagnosis again, which would absolutely crush me bc for the first time, I'm able to make some sense of what's been going on with me my whole life and I ain't tryna switch treatment plans and meds all over again.

Go to a doctor though u cant find out here",,1bhorrm
1,"personally i self diagnosed because i relate to almost all of these symptoms. i was told by an old counselor of mine that it's fine to self diagnose if you display 5/9 symptoms. i'm pretty sure that's how they (whoever diagnoses people) diagnose us anyways. i'm going to do my best to go down the list of criteria and tell you what i think about each of them in relation to you.

1. consistent feelings of emptiness -  i feel this way as well, constantly.
2. persistent and unstable sense of self - i will say this; in terms of mimicking, it isn't just mimicking the way someone talks. it is also mimicking the bad parts of someone. i have realized i also mimic my ex partners behaviors that aren't good behaviors as well as his typical behaviors. (he's my most recent ex/fp, he split up with me two weeks ago due to my bpd being wildly out of wack.)
3. unstable relationships - this one screams bpd. 100%. it hurts to read cuz i know how it feels to be in love and in a fairytale like love to hating the person suddenly.
4. repetitive suicidal thoughts, threats, gestures or behaviors - i also constantly having that thought in my mind. it's always sitting in the back of my mind. i ODed before, a few years ago. the thoughts, threats, gestures and behaviors haven't left since. i've told my mom i'd do it in front of her one time when she made me very angry. i tend to go to suicidal thoughts/threats after most arguments with my most recent ex. i'm not sure why but i feel like i crumble to the ground and i just want it to be over. i'm not very in control of myself at this point and i just want it all to end most days. so i get it. 100%.
5. frantic efforts to avoid abandonment - this sounds a lot like bpd as well. i sometimes want people who hurt me. i sometimes don't care that they did. i chalk it up to i deserve it because of my bpd. i don't know if you do that.

I hurt more people than I am proud of, and I didn't even want to sleep with them or hook up with them. 

What worked for me was trying to make it as not about sex as possible. I think being this way makes things feel like it is a lot more than what reality is. And that included sex for me.

I was just making very bad decisions... And as much as other people had their role and responsibility in it. I am responsible for choosing poorly and making bad decisions. Whether I have bpd or not.
