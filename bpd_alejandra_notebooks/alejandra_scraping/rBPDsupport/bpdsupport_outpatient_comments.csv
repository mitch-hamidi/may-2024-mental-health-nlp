I am unsure what DBT is but I‚Äôm sorry to hear what you are going through and especially when you feel alone. I hope everything turns out a bit better for you, I find watching motivation videos on YouTube / instragram or looking at quotes really help me to feel better about my entire existence. Maybe give this a go?",Delicious-Visit-4740,1cpxs35
1,"I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having a tough time. I can relate to a lot of what you just said.

I don‚Äôt have much advice other than can you get your hands on the workbook? There‚Äôs also DBT cards. Look up distress tolerance skills. I‚Äôve made a distraction bag for when I‚Äôm spiraling. It‚Äôs got a fidget toy, sour candy, icy hot, a little toy I like, my book, and a stress ball. Good luck. I hope you find the support you need :)",JohnDwyersDanceMoves,1cpxs35

3,"Thank you, I‚Äôve been watching DBT videos. DBT stands for Dialectical Behaviour Therapy. It‚Äôs the treatment made by Dr. Marsha Linehan for BPD sufferers. It‚Äôs not cheap, and I‚Äôve been told to see if I can get it with my private health insurance. I will ring and see.",TiredSleepyGrumpy,1cpxs35
4,"Thank you. üòä I will make a bag for myself. And I do have a workbook, but not ‚Äúthe workbook‚Äù. I will keep monitoring it until it‚Äôs a price I can afford. üòä

I really appreciate the tip. Hope you‚Äôre having an amazing day!",TiredSleepyGrumpy,1cpxs35

6,"I was diagnosed at 16 and when I was 19 was in a inpatient program for longer than the program goes for because I was struggling so badly at the time and I remember the psychologist/ psychiatrist advising that it‚Äôs easier to overcome BPD when your younger, so you may not need this treatment but just some determination to better your mental wellbeing by seeking help and genuinely following through with it.

Just my thoughts if you‚Äôre worried about your financial situation but I hope it goes well for you if you do end up getting it! I‚Äôll have a look into it",Delicious-Visit-4740,1cpxs35
7,Thank you for sharing. I *wish* I knew I had BPD when I was that age! That was decades ago now.,TiredSleepyGrumpy,1cpxs35
0,"You're chasing a label. Labels can be helpful for you to understand your problem. They can be helpful for other people to understand your problem. However, the box that you've been placed in by someone else is just that - it's a box. It's never usually as simple as someone having one problem and everyone's experience of mental health is unique. No two people with a labelled disorder are the same. 

Have you heard the statement ""all models are wrong, some are useful""? Well it's very true in the case of the DSM categorisations of disorders. Nobody is 100% BPD and 0% NPD because they share some traits. Nobody is 0% autistic. The DSM is actually more of a sensemaking framework than a categorisation framework. So there's not necessarily a right or wrong answer as to which pigeonhole a person fits into, it's just a way to try and make sense of the situation and help decide what to do next. 

Also, bear in mind that in a way the label gives you validation that you're right. In many cases NPD/BPD people were starved of validation from carers (especially parents) as children and many of their behaviours seek an outcome of validation, often from authority figures. Consider the idea that you could be seeking the validation of psychiatrists when actually it's more important that you recognise which patterns of thought are unhealthy and develop healthy coping strategies to manage them.

If you're being blocked from receiving treatment and going through a hard time I'm sorry for that. It can be difficult to know where to start with treatment. There are a huge number of resources online for  you to get started with helping yourself. If you're interested I can share some links. 

**TL;DR Drop the idea that a label is important unless it's stopping you from accessing treatment**",The_RealMe,gdqhxy
1,"It's great that you're getting a fresh evaluation and diagnosis, I can tell you attached you are to the label and how helpful it would feel to be validated.

Today, I would say that it is wrong and insensitive to people with a BPD diagnosis for you to claim a diagnosis you have not been given. The fact is that you might experience a different PD like OCPD or PD-NOS, it's also possible the feelings you shared are more related to other factors completely.

Good luck with the eval, you seem motivated to share and work with mental health professionals to validate your experience. Let us know how it goes",TranZeitgeist,gdqhxy

1,"Your mother sounds a lot like my mom. I have been no contact with her for 7 months, and it‚Äôs been much better. I‚Äôm not sure what your living situation looks like with her, but maybe in time, you can consider this option. Because I fucking GUARANTEE you are not even remotely the cause of your father to leave. And I also guarantee, your mom has been emotionally neglectful your entire life, and you‚Äôve been made out to feel like it‚Äôs your fault when, in reality, she just can‚Äôt live with the idea that she‚Äôs unfit. You deserve better. You will find inner peace, and you will find people who fill the role you so desperately need and deserve. 

I understand how it feels like everything has been ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù, but I promise it‚Äôs not. She has no agency to decide that.",wazzledazzle,ul6h66
2,"I can really relate as I have been in a relationship with someone like your mom and even been like your mom or parroted those beliefs of you should be able to do things because I can. It is a highly narcissistic way of thinking. It isn't correct and the person saying that lacks empathy or can't deal with THEIR emotions. Please understand that. You are not incorrect.

In my case the person who was telling me these things I kept trying to explain to her that the more she pushed the further locked in my mental crisis prison I would get. It was horrible. I empathize so much with your pain and anger and self hatred. I tried and tried to change myself that way and its exhausting and soul crushing. 

From your post it sounds like your mom is very mentally damaging for you to be around. Is there a reason you are stuck being around her? Is there any way you can get out or away from her influence? You clearly have a lot of pain to process and this is only  making it worse. She probably will not listen to you. 


In my case the only thing that soothed that intense self loathing was that, miracle of miracles, the person who was pushing and gaslighting me ended up validating the harm they did to me apologizing and reaffirming that I did not deserve it (up to that point they insisted I deserved it). I have been locked in cycles with her for a long time. And the way out was that I swallowed my pride and apologized and took responsibility for the damage I had done her, and listened to her even though I didn't agree with her perspective, and she actually opened up about how much my behavior hurt her or just the pain she was feeling, and then I was able to follow that up by sharing the same, how much her behavior had impacted me. We still have to separate to heal and protect ourselves but I have never felt ANYTHING like that moment of validation. It showed me how powerfully mind destroying gaslighting is to someone with a vulnerable mind. I began to imagine what it would be like to be around people who did not gaslight me at all, even if I was simply alone. I imagined how different life might feel. 

It inspired me to decide with a heavy heart I have to cut off contact further with my parents if they keep gaslighting me and leave a job that is confusing where I have bad boundaries.
 I have thought I can tolerate it and explain or just put my feelings aside. But there will come a breakthrough point when you realize how much your peace matters and that nothing in the world is worth mental chaos because it will destroy your soul and everyone around you will be affected. 

All that is to say I hope you can find a way to unentangle from your mom even if you still care or love her. Don't be surprised if things begin to feel a lot different. The stuff you are saying here is very heavy and dangerous. That amount of shame and self blame will eat you alive. It isn't that you have BPD and are bad as much as your BPD may be allowing you to emotionally stay in a destructive situation. 

All the best to you.",oisin_berry,ul6h66
3,"thank you so much. Im really happy that you‚Äôre doing much better now that you have zero contact. i wish i could leave too but she relies on me for so much. i help pay her bills and she‚Äôs threatened to kill herself before. and i never realized how messed up it is until now. and you‚Äôre right she did emotionally neglect me my whole life. 
i‚Äôm just gonna try to cut back on speaking about any of my issues to her until we‚Äôre in the presence of a mediator like a therapist because i don‚Äôt see the value in communicating with her anymore. everything i say to her is ‚Äúmanipulation.‚Äù i‚Äôm going to focus on staying productive and healthy as much as i can. thanks again!",ImpossibleBicycle249,ul6h66
4,"Oh no this is very clear now that you shared this information. It sounds like you are in a mind trap where she is able to exploit your guilt and shame to make you useful for herself as she probably can't face her own inability to care for herself.  

I also struggle with oversharing my issues with unfit people, an early childhood pattern. That you can recognize it is a great step. Maybe you can find another outlet or somewhere to receive validation as it seems you are experiencing a strong amount of manipulation and gaslighting yourself from her and she is projecting. If you are paying her bills and she is threatening to kill herself if you leave that is an abusive domestic situation and you may need more serious help to extract yourself don't take it lightly. There are domestic violence shelters and places that could help you begin the process when and if you are ready. 

You got this and deserve to experience a more free life no matter what you have done! Sometimes we can't help people we love except by helping ourselves.

You can have compassion for your mom and what she's been through and still choose to save yourself. It may be the hardest thing you ever have to do but remember there are people out here who can help and give you love and support. You are never as alone as you think.",oisin_berry,ul6h66
5,"thank you for your comments. i think its really good to hear from an outside perspective because i've been getting gaslighted so much to the point where i have no idea what is real and what isn't.  she's never made ""actual threats of suicide"" its always been said lightly as a joke but somehow that makes it worse because its hard to tell if she's being serious or not. Im not sure what to do but i just want to thank you again for your comments because somehow it feels like you've opened a door in my mind. your comments were validating and actually made me feel like a real person. I rarely feel like that so thank you, truly. I managed to get an appointment tomorrow to speak with a psychotherapist, she deals with BPD and family conflict so I pray she helps.  I want to help myself.  

I wish you the best as well.",ImpossibleBicycle249,ul6h66
6,"Ah I see, and yes I understand what that loss of reality is like. Its disorienting. 
Im really glad something clicked. Getting validation and feeling like a real human is more powerful than we might give it credit. 
Good luck with the appointment its so great you found some help!",oisin_berry,ul6h66
