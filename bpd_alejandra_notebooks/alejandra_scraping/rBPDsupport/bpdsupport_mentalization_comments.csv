4,In what way? I just feel like he thinks I’m better mentally than I actually am,brucethesharkoohaha,170doj8
5,Yeah he compared it to when you have a cough and you google it of course you’re going to think you are dying or have some incurable disease because of one symptom. He said he can’t see any of the symptoms from me but he doesn’t know what goes on inside my head… on the outside I look so chill and composed but that’s definitely not the case.,brucethesharkoohaha,170doj8

0,"I think you should first start seeing a metal health professional who specializes in BPD/any of the other disorders to help you through what you’re dealing with right now. Then ask them what you should/could do. 

There has to be some kind of medical privacy code of conduct that teacher is breaking by doing what he did to you. Maybe a metal health professional would know if there is and what you can do about it. Or at the very least what the best way to go about letting the college know and keeping yourself safe/coping with what you went through and any triggers going back might bring.  I’m sorry you’re going through this and I hope you are able to succeed. The fact that you’re still trying after all of that is a testament to how strong you are.",love_me_madly,17fojbl

0,"I don’t know much about DID, but this is the advice I’d give for BPD alone. 

The big question for me is whether your loved one is in treatment or open to treatment. BPD is a personality disorder that is indicated by having at least 5/9 symptoms listed in the DSM. With treatment, you absolutely CAN reduce your symptoms to have less than 5, meaning you no longer qualify. The work is difficult, dialectical behavioral therapy is what I did and I still have to practice every day, but it’s 100% worth it. 

I wouldn’t leave a partner just for having a mental health diagnosis. However, if they aren’t interested in going through treatment, that is usually a recipe for codependency and compassion fatigue.",fashlatebloomer,g2vk1t

0,"it’s good that you’ve tried to communicate with him. BPD is tough because it’s sometimes hard to tell whether something you’re feeling is “valid” or not because of our tendency to feel things so intensely. If he is serious about staying with you, he should do some research on BPD himself and learn how to help himself/you cope with it. Of course you should also try your best to not let BPD impact your relationship but the effort needs to come from both sides in order for your relationship to work.",alexisblueit,hfuwa8

2,"8 years ago I had a beautiful girlfriend that I would die for. She always argued with me about my diagnosis. I just wasn't enough for her and I tried and tried for years but I finally realized, it was never going to get better. So one day she attempted suicide and almost succeeded. Se said I was not stable and blamed me for her attempt. So I did the hardest thing that I've ever done and even though I loved her more than heaven itself, I left her because all I was doing was killing her. 3 months after we separated, she hung herself in my back yard while I was asleep on my birthday. I found her that morning hanging from a tree with a not that said ""you dont deserve to live and you showed me that I dont either. I hate you"". It will always be the biggest regret of my life. But my point is, somtimes no matter how hard you try, it doesn't matter if they dont care. If you ever need someone to talk to, my cell number is 3154407748.

0,"First off, what that meme page did was absolutely despicable.  The culture of “exposing” people has become toxic in a way that nobody wants to have conversations anymore.  It’s like, if someone disagrees with you they’re a bigot and should lose everything.  Weird shit, man.

As for the video itself, I essentially agree with everything he is saying.  People without mental illness don’t understand how completely pervasive is it, and how MUCH it affects your life.  Social media makes people chronically sad, like the guy in the video said, so people think that they’re depressed.  Depression isn’t even genuine states of deep sadness, it’s the brains inability to function properly.  However, I don’t think people without actual depression will ever really fully understand that.

Technically, I am “self-diagnosed” and I think that’s fine.  I may sound like a hypocrite because I agree with everything in the video, but I’m not of the same profile as the people he described as “self-diagnosers.”  I’m not an e-girl, I try to stay off of social media, and I don’t tell anyone that I think I have BPD.  Even when I talk about it to myself, the key phrase is “think”.

I have included myself in the BPD community because I identify with all of the symptoms and heavily relate to the experiences of everyone else in this form.  I don’t claim to deal with BPD publicly, because I don’t feel comfortable claiming something I haven’t been formally diagnosed with, regardless of how much I believe I have it.

For me, this label helps me identify my bad behaviors and why I do things that make me feel like an insane person, and that’s enough for right now.  Someday I may decided to get a proper diagnosis, but for right now it’s not something I feel I need.

Curious how other people may feel about this.",caradized,hjhoas

Additionally, from personal experience, I can tell you with absolute assurance that BPD is just one is those labels that mental health professionals don't want to reveal to patients. And that's simply owing to the misinformation out there about this illness, in terms of stigma and inconclusive online literature. The diagnosis is hidden from the patient in an attempt to protect them from overthinking and spiralling. However, now that you are an adult, you have every legal right to demand an accurate diagnostic finding. Have a candid conversation with your doctor, I assure you it's more to do with the rules within the psychiatric community, and less to do with you. You got this.",,17szsas

0,I relate to this a lot. I didn’t realize for a long time that it was a pattern. It’s frustrating. Even when it is a male friend that I truly have no sexual attraction to it becomes an issue due to past behavior. I struggle with female relationships and just don’t feel the same connection to the majority of people. When I do find a close connection it’s typically with a guy and threatens my husband.  I can accept that I created the reasons he reacts the way he does but it still sucks.

0,"I know how you feel. I've felt different most of my life. People generally treat me the same. Most people though just don't understand what our condition is or what we go through in our heads. Most people may try to help with certain situations but fail miserably at understanding, no matter how hard you try to explain, how you see or feel about things. But that's why communication is important. If they're willing to attempt to understand, I would try to explain it until they can at least understand even a little bit. 

Before being officially diagnosed I studied my symptoms starting back in middle school. My now deceased wife (passed of cancer) helped me a lot. She saw me at my absolute worst and still chose to be with me. I was able to talk to her about anything. It got to a point she'd be able to detect one of ""outbursts"" before it happened and helped me through. I learned a lot of coping skills and am a lot calmer of a person because of her. Currently, I have one friend I trust enough to talk to. 

If you have someone you can trust, my advise is talk to them about things. Even if all they do is listen. It helps. I've also found that being open about my condition helps me and helps others understand me. So I've recently started a podcast where I talk about my life and different situations I've been through as well as how I feel about certain topics. Even if I never grow an audience I'll continue doing the podcast because it's a way for me to get things off my chest (vent) and I'll be able to listen to episodes in the future to see how much I've changed compared to when I spoke about a situation and how I might handle it differently as opposed to when I went through it. 

I chose podcasting on purpose because I feel a blog would gain an audience faster, and whereas I do want to talk about it and put it out there, part of me is still a bit scared or nervous about how some people may view what I say. But either way, it's an outlet for me to relieve my stresses and vent; which does help.",RedConradcom,14h1jz1
1,"Hey, no matter what your symptoms and experience - you aren't alone! Remember that. 

BPD is complex, and every case is uniquely formed and expressed. People - including doctors - would often downplay my mental illness because I'm more of the ""quiet"" subtype with a high functioning presentation. It was misdiagnosed for many years because of that in combination with my not having an obvious history of abuse. But trauma is much more complicated than that. Having our mental illness and experience invalidated of course contributes to the overall issue.

If you meet the criteria, or even some of the symptoms that severely affect you, then they need to be addressed no matter what anyone thinks. No matter your situation, yes, your brain HAS been wired a certain way by your environment and experiences. And it can be rewired in time. DBT is a great place to start - if you can't do it formally, there are many books and resources online. I'd also highly recommend Dr. Daniel Fox's YouTube channel, as well as his Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook. His workbook is pretty unique compared to other ones out there; it's my favorite one I've come across. I'm going to be starting my own channel soon, but more for the peer support side and to share my personal experience with BPD and recovery - I'm not a doctor or licensed in any way and will still suggest there that people refer to his content for clinical information.

BPD is an isolating experience, but that's why peer support is so important. I haven't felt understood regarding the strength of my emotions by anyone in life besides those with similar issues. Keep reaching out. BUT be wary about info you come across, even within this subreddit. There are so many misconceptions, and they can be harmful to recovery. Have hope. I promise things won't always be as they are currently as long as you keep working towards change.

The what ifs are not helpful, you’re stressing yourself out over something that’s probably not even real, having bpd and living with bpd is being aware of how you’re as a person so being aware of your triggers, being aware of how you react in stressful situations, how you treat others, bpd is only passed down to your children if you raise them how your parents raised you, having a diagnosis means that you can help yourself if you choose to, having a diagnosis means you know what the fuck is going on with your body and brain, you’re going off delusions now that are “what if” so let’s say yes this is outcome now how do you choose to help yourself?

The best thing to do to overcome that fear is to embrace it and learn coping skills to help yourself manage the rollercoaster of emotions you experience at every turn. I also have bpd… but I don’t let that “ label” define who I am… we’re still God’s children at the end of the day.

0,Ugh I felt this so hard. And idk honestly on if they still count as a FP because a lot of the times it’s a pretty uneven relationship (you giving/doing more then them in most situations) I know it’s easier said then done but maybe yall should put off moving until everyone has a job so it’s not all on you because in this economy that’s going to possibly put you in a situation where you lose all and end up with an eviction. Setting boundaries is hard especially with your fp because you just wanna be able to do it all even at the expense of yourself. I find writing a budget physically down helps me a bit and when asked for thing I share that budget to show it’s not a viable solution at this point because I wouldn’t be able to pay for needs A and B if I gave you C.,I_wish_i_was_a_alien,1cd6d22

2,"I was always an overachiever and had a really great career. I thrived on stress, but after a series of failed relationships I couldn’t outrun my trauma anymore and had a very intense mental breakdown that forced me to evaluate my career goals. Here are a few things I came to realize:

1. I needed to be in an office. I was working remotely for 4 years and literally went insane without daily human interaction. Everyone is different but working remotely just doesn’t work for me bc I can’t be trusted within 100 ft of a bed.
2. I used to have meetings all day and night, Europe in the early morning, east coast in the afternoon, west coast in the evening, Asia at night. Not every day but I was in a global position and my meeting schedule was unpredictable and stressful and I fucking loathed it.
3. I was in a strategic position that came with a lot of pressure to generate revenue - it was beyond stressful and my nervous system was wrecked after prolonged stress and I fell into a long depressive episode after my breakdown.

I ended up finding a new job that pays less but it’s so much less stressful. I have daily tasks that are boring but easy and predictable. When I leave everyday I don’t have to think about work at all. I leave it at the door and focus on other things when I get home.

I was reading about it that BPD or BPD traits can occur due to being raised by abusive caregivers who didn't recognize or see ASD in their child.

0,"I mean this in the nicest most gentle way possible but it doesn’t sound like he’s a good match for you. Being autistic isn’t an excuse to neglect your partner, even if you struggle with empathy or meeting your partners needs. I don’t think you’re overreacting. 

Also Asperger’s is a really outdated term for autism, they’re the same thing except the term Asperger’s has nazi origins (look it up). The autistic community doesn’t use it anymore",Demonderus,171hqaj
1,"I too am in a relationship with a person who has autism so I have had to think about similar stuff a lot. Here are some conclusions I've come to. You may know them already and they might not be helpful to you. 

First of all, where does the feeling of emotional come from? People with autism often have difficulties with things we find ""normal"" in a relationship, but the question is, are they actually ""normal""? Or at least, why do we think they are normal? The point in such questions is to show that there are different ways of showing affection, and I'm not speaking about the so-called ""love languages"", but rather about the fact that neurodivergent people (people with autism and/or ADHD) just in general communicate differently than neurotypicals. For example, neurodivergent people might have a ""flat affect"", which means a flat tone of voice or/and a flat facial expression. There is nothing wrong in this nor does it express that something is wrong, it just is a different way of communating.

This different communication also includes how one shows affection. So, for example, if I expect my partner to show affection in a certain way, I might be expecting something that she would have to pretend, and I don't want her to pretend to show affection in a certain way just so that I'm happy. Because more often than not, this pretending will make her unhappy. But if I let her to show affection in the way she finds natural, she will come up with the most sweet and caring stuff, which all are natural to her. How could I not want and respect that?

Secondly, I've had to learn to grow self-confidence. My partner will not pick up subtle hints about my feelings or needs, I have to be direct with these. And even then, the above is still the case: She might not answer to my needs and feelings ""normally"", ie. in a way I would expect, but in her own way. Additionally, I have to have the self-confidence to put up my own boundaries. So I can't sacrifice myself for my partner, or always put myself before her. 

In general, being in a relationship with a person with autism might become one-sided if one isn't clear about your boundaries or if one expects something from one's partner which is not natural to her. Further, a relationship with a person with autism can be one-sided in the sense that the person who is neurotypical often becomes the main support for the person with autism since she has to navigate what is essentially an alien social reality to her. 

Hope these are at least of some help to you. Still, even saying all of the above, it might be, as the other commentator said, that your partner really is not there for you emotionally. But perhaps you can ponder your problem through the above. Feel free to ask anything more if you want to!

I hope you find the right way forward 🙏",Hour_Tomatillo8730,171hqaj
2,"Thank you for your comment, I understand where you are coming from and appreciate your input and words! I know it’s an outdated term, but he uses Asperger’s as a term, so I’m respecting that as he prefers to be called that term but also understand what you’re saying!",Tiny_Lime5707,171hqaj
0,"A lot of it is mental and can be tied to sexual abuse. For me, making sex into something as normal as a handshake felt like it downplayed the abuse. As I get older though, sexual experiences can be their own traumatizing events that keep me from moving forward. 

It can also feel like the only way to be close to someone, especially since I’m not an affectionate person at all and don’t like to be touched. 

Now I’ve very much swung the other way to the point of looking up being asexual. Could also be the antidepressants, but it also isn’t worth the drama and risks.

0,"I’ve been recently diagnosed with BPD also. I actually suspected that I had BPD for a long time and it was a bit of a process to actually get a diagnosis. Because it took so long, I thought that I had come to an acceptance of my diagnosis already. 

But since I’ve gotten officially diagnosed, it’s all kind of hit me. BPD is a really heavy diagnosis. It’s difficult to know that some of your thinking is warped and faulty. It’s difficult to know that BPD is hard to treat and it might take awhile to get better. It’s difficult to hear just how painful BPD can be (although this can be validating at times). 

So I can say I’ve been going through a similar feeling. I’ve been feeling pretty guilty since my diagnosis and as if I’m a crazy person. I feel like I have nothing good to offer and that I’m going to destroy every good relationship that I get into. Also, since my diagnosis, I’ve started to see things that I did in my past that were definitely a result of BPD, but I just didn’t know it at the time. 

It’s a difficult process to go through, but I believe that it does get better. It just takes a lot of time to process such a heavy hitting diagnosis. Wish you the best 💕",thefinestbagels,14jq1j9

Being ""too much"" is my CONSTANT fear. It's so hard and painful to know that because we love so hard and NEED deep emotional connection/validation, that we're going to lose it over and over. 

I think about this multiple times per day, every day, for years. 

Now that I've painted that grim pic... it doesn't have to significantly and constantly impact everyone around you. Therapy and mindfulness (as much as i HATE mindfulness) really really helps. 

It's impressive that you recognize the role your behaviors may have played in relationships of all kinds. It took me years to really own that.",Complete-Scar-2077,14jq1j9
4,"I'm sorry you're experiencing these feelings, but please know those loops are common - and both possible AND important (although difficult) to break. 

It's realistic, understandable, and okay to be unhappy with your behaviors when dealing with BPD. But with knowledge, practice, consistency, and time, those behaviors can and will change. All of the things about yourself that are bothering you and making you feel less-than, and that people have likely also made you feel less-than for, do not define you. Lacking a sense of self is common with BPD, but you do have a core self, and you can heal and change all of the other parts in time. 

It's hard to deal with a diagnosis, but I think knowing is better as long as you don't give into all the misinformation and stigma there is. I was misdiagnosed until I figured it out myself at 28, and the invalidation that came from not being able to recover with medicine or CBT and being told essentially that I'm just too hard on myself and didn't have reason to feel how I felt, was very damaging.  There is a valid reason you are the way you are, there are effective treatments, and it's totally possible for you to get better, learn to love yourself, and create a life worth living. I didn't have that information or guidance, and I still figured it out. I haven't met the DSM criteria, self harmed, or had suicidal thoughts for over a year and a half now. I promise you can get there too.

I'd suggest getting into DBT if you can, and if you can't, find materials online. I also always suggest Dr. Daniel Fox's content. His YouTube channel is very informative, and I highly recommend his BPD workbook.",SarruhTonin,14jq1j9

The thing is, you definitely weren't asking 4 abuse if it was thrown your way. Yes some symptoms make you hurt people, or mb just act like an ahole, but it doesn't automatically make you an ahole. I suggest you use that feelings as a motivation to better yourself, recognize patterns, unintentional manipulations, self hurting behavior, self sabotage and other stuff and try to fix it, control yourself and get therapy.

About bpd episodes I'd suggest you learn to recognize when they begin and distance yourself 4 about 30min just to calm down, so later you can talk rationally. You can scream, hit your pillow, cry, vent to people, do whatever you feel like doing. I prefer to distract myself. And later you can constructively talk about what happened.",Tashe4ka,14jq1j9

Until i found a doctor that i really felt comfortable with and liked her so much. I’ve seen her regularly for about 2 years now and it took her a year to diagnose me with bpd with therapy lots of tests (hormones tests, brain scans, adhd tests and  many other to eliminate other diagnoses).

1,"I’m literally going through this right now. It’s tough to feel this way. My partner loves me so much and has always been so patient but lately I feel like he’s been getting sick of my disorder and it just makes me feel even guiltier abt my existence. It’s hard to not also cause a fight over feeling like he’s losing his patience for me.

Another thing with BPD though- we have to give these people who are with us grace. YES we have to feel the shitty emotions that are enough to take us out on a daily basis. BUT, they also have to sit there and deal with us and these emotions they cannot comprehend. That can be really confusing and stressful sometimes! If I were a “normal” person and saw the shit I get mad over I’d be like wtf girl 😭😭😭😭. They’re allowed to feel their emotions just like we are! They can’t always be smiles and rainbows just because they don’t have BPD. That’s a CRAZYYY unrealistic standard to hold our partners to. 

Two things can be true at once, okay? They can be human beings with their own valid emotions and they can still love us at the same time. Obviously a relationship with one person being a borderline requires effort, understanding, and patience from both sides. But we need to keep in mind that it’s ON US TO HEAL OURSELVES AND LEARN TO EMOTIONALLY REGULATE ONE DAY! ❤️

At the end of the day if your partner respects you and your relationship and makes you feel loved that’s what we deserve, to be loved! We can’t always expect the people we love to completely understand us or respond the way we want them to. In my personal experience I mostly feel the way you do because I idolize my partner WAYYY too aggressively sometimes. It’s hard to work on but it can be done! ❤️

If you truly still feel like it’s your partner who is neglecting your feelings or purposely does try to trigger you and it’s NOT your BPD clouding the reality, then that’s fucked up and you deserve better.

1,"I'm sorry that you're in so much pain right now. As a licensed clinician with BPD (although I've been in remission for a few years now), I can't stress how beneficial seeking professional support can be in the long run. Sure, therapy can be expensive *if you're only looking at self-pay therapists*. Many group practices offer pro-bono services. Community mental health centers offer free or low-cost services and always accept Medicaid/Medicare. 99% of all private practice therapists offer a sliding scale fee so that the fee for services aligns with your income to make therapy more affordable and reduce financial barriers when services are needed. My main point here is that you don't have to do this alone. It's okay to ask for help and there is help out there if you ask.",bornforthis23,15sgmbj

If you know you’re in a spiral about it, personally I would mention to them that you know and it’s bothering you.

My partner has asked when I start those type conversations that I give them a bit of a disclaimer so they can shift into the appropriate headspace. Ex: “hey I’ve had something on my mind that’s turning into a spiral, I don’t want it to turn into self sabotaging. Do you have the mental space to listen and help me navigate through these thoughts?

One other thing u can do is, tell ur partner ur splitting on them, and the pain, ur issues and overthinking is making u go spiral. Tell her that u understand the situation and u need time to process ur emotions. My advice would be to not push them away and ask for space, but keep them close, hug them or cuddle with them, rest with them so ur assured that they are gonna be with you. Do this, it will help to not add abandonment issues to ur spiral of emotions.

I apologize, but don't ask them for anything which leaves the ball in their court to either accept me and my apology, or decide they aren't able/willing to deal with it.

0,"Dissocation is a criteria/common symptom of BPD and that scale is usually used to see what type of dissocation you are experiencing to help you with it. Like it's not usually used as it's own diagnostic tool or anything. I do have a dissociative disorder along with BPD and my therapist used that to see what symptoms were effecting my life the worst and how to help me the best. Dissocation can effect your life pretty severely and they are probably just trying to help you.

It scores for three things and each specific questions shows the specific they effect you. Amnesia which is pretty self explanatory, as well as depersonalization and derealization which is a disconnection from your sense of self/connection to reality, and last absorption factor which basically feeling like you loose yourself in things like watching shows or doing a task.

If this doesn't makes sense I can try and answer more questions if you have them.

Also some doctors don't really know much about dissocation so that may be why they didn't ask you to take it before,",ZoogieBear,164xo6o

My I received my initial diagnosis, it was during COVID season so imagine that will also be a factor in why I’ve not taken it previously, as everything was a telephone appointment. 

Depersonalisation and derealisation are terms I’ve heard previously however not clearly understood but your explain really does help.

I am thinking of ending things with him but I can't because I still love him so so so much despite how frustrated I am. 

I am sure you didn't cheat, lie, or manipulate your partner. Relationships are not easy and I learned it the hard way. Maybe he still loves you but just needed time apart so you guys can heal.

4,"perhaps there are some subreddits that you could seek book/workbook couples therapy and potentially bpd specific books reccomendations from? You could also look up basic partner communication guides. I feel statements are a great place to start and there are many templates online to help guide the sentence structure so you arent putting blame on each other. for example ""when you ___ i feel ___"" so maybe ""when you don't tell me how you feel about something troubling that has happened, I feel like I have to come to my own conclusions about these things. My conclusions arent always rooted in reality and I know this. I would love help with bridging the gap between my perception of reality, and what is actually going on."" Or something like ""When I gave up on myself in this relationship i feel like that is when you started to love me more. Is that true? Maybe I just started being able to see it more because you started expressing it outwardly more. What do you think about that?"" And then also look up ways to have hard conversations. Maybe you both need to be allowed to take a 5 minute break if things escalate. Maybe you need to establish some phrases that would be helpful beforehand like ""I am processing how I feel about this before I respond which is why I am being quiet.""

Ultimately, dont give up on yourself. You are worthy of love even if you dont feel like it. When we start telling ourselves these extremely negative narratives of who we are, that we are a monster, that we ruin things, etc. It starts becoming a self fulfilling priphecy because we start acting in extreme ways in a desperate attempt to be loved despite these things, while also knowing that no one deserves to go through the things we are putting them through and we are actively pushing them away and making them chose between loving themself or loving us.",TransGuyKindaFly,14frr5o

You are not crazy; you are a victim of past trauma and invalidation of your emotions, and your brain has adapted in order to survive. BPD is fucking awful a lot of the time, but it IS treatable and there are positive outcomes possible.

maybe try breaking it up into digestible chunks?

Whenever you find yourself in these situations where you feel an episode incoming, take a moment to breathe and collect yourself before doing anything impulsive and potentially destructive - becoming mindful of your actions and present will help you when you’re in a high emotional state. You may want to do something action based to let out these feelings but think about how you channel them. Speak to those around you that you’re noticing your emotions heightening, that the state you’re in will not be logical.

We BPD folk put so much onto others and our emotions and that baggage gets so heavy on our loved ones that it can become overbearing. You have to learn to be your own world, so that the ones we hold onto, won’t feel sooo devastating when they can’t handle us anymore.",Pleasant_Chain_3152,1cmsjc7

0,"I haven't cried this hard in a few months. I had to let go of my partner. When I say that, I mean I have BPD, C-PTSD, MDD, and DID. The second my partner joined that subreddit, it was just a slow decline. There were other factors. But ever since then, it's like, in his mind, everything I do is to try and manipulate him. Or play victim. It's like I went from his partner to his enemy in a matter of days. Do your best to get him into an actual support group for loved ones of BPD. Because 97% of the post on that subreddit is just negative. There is nothing about supporting each other. Or their spouse or how to deal with the stress and feelings of overwhelming helplessness and resentment that build trying to support or love someone with this condition in a healthy way. 

But I saw him pulling away. And I didn't just split. I tried to talk things out. I talked to my therapist and psychologist. In my case, they came to the conclusion that his expectations of the quality of progress I was making wasn't enough for him. And he was likely to break up with me. I didn't let that break me. Like I always did in the past. I focused on my therapy and God. Continued to work on myself. And is it at times the most miserable, painful experience of my life. Not being with him.. 

Not texting. Or calling him on his lunch break to hear how his day is going. Going to his house and playing minecraft. Listening to songs in the car and holding hands. Watching him play video games with his friends or learning about code. Seeing the smile on his face when he figures out how to solve a problem. The way he scrinches up his face when people say things he thinks is ignorant. Or the cute way he talks to his cats. I miss him every  second of every minute of every hour of every day, weeks, and months we have been apart.

 And he did ask for a break. And we are on this very long break it's been 5 months. We hardly ever talk. Or text or meet up. When we do talk, we argue. But, we almost always say I love you when we hang up. And I know he's trying to work on himself.  And so am I. I'm doing everything I can to move forward. To continue fighting  those waves that try to take me under, I say all this not to scare you. But, because as much as I miss him. I know this is what he needed. And what I needed. I know we wouldn't have BPD if doing this was easy. And if the pain we experience wasn't almost impossible to bear at the thought or realization that we are going to lose someone you love. But, this is about being able to face you fears over and over again. There are gonna be days that you lose, but you can't keep letting that fear control your life. Or it will keep trying to kill you. Until it succeed.

Every time I stand up to face my fears, it gets just a little bit easier. Because you'll slowly start to realize you can do it. You start to trust in your ability to adapt and rise to the occasion. 

One scariest things for me is the unknown. 

Things I don't know: 
AM I  Unloveable?
Am I damaged beyond repair?
What will I do if he leaves for good?
Can I do this on my own?..
Will I ever heal from my abuse?
Can I ever truly forgive my family 
Forgive My rapists?..

I don't know. 
But as I work on myself. And very slowly heal from my past. And unlearn my bad habits, negative thinking, and self sabotage. Learning how to listen to myself and my desires.Learning who I am. Building real love and compassion for myself. The unknown is now know. No not everything but a few things on that list I finally know the real answer.

Something I realized when I started loving myself. Is I can't be unlovable like my mother said if I love myself.  I can't be unlovable if God loves me. And being alone isn't the worst thing you could be. Trust me when I say this it's gonna be hard. But not impossible. If you have the will there is a way through it. God will come through for you like he's always done for me. Not always in the way we want. But if you put your trust in him that he will help you. All you need is the will and the faith to trust him to lead you through the dark into the light. You'll come out of this better than before. And you'll get all the comfort you'll ever need. And if you where to lose your way again you'll know he's right there with you. Waiting for you to take his hand. Never ever leaving your side. 

I love you, but God loves you more. 🫂

1,"You are right. You are NOT a monster. YOU… ARE… NOT… A… MONSTER. You are the result of what happens when a person is mistreated or abused by their parents or another adult. My heart bleeds for you. 

My husband works hard to understand me. I know that if he fell into a group like that he would quickly see that it was not productive and simply BPD bashing and he would seek a better group. 

But here’s the thing… we are the victims of our abusive parents, but our loved ones can become victims of BPD through its manifestation in us. They need help to get through this, too. It is unfortunate that groups can get like that but I guarantee there are other options for him. Whether they are here on Reddit or in an actual face to face support group or even individual counseling. They need help. Don’t catastrophize… fix it. 

Tell him your concerns and have ready a list of options you feel would actually be helpful to him because you care about HIM and not just your relationship or losing him. And if you are not in couples counseling please, by all means, consider getting into it. It has helped me and my husband tremendously for each of us to see through each other’s eyes and understand what is needed. And when it isn’t clear, our trained therapist who knows a lot about BPD helps us figure it out. 

Whatever you do, do not let yourself go down the path of self loathing and wanting to give up. Anyone who has BPD knows exactly what that means as we have all been there. DO NOT GO THERE. You are strong enough to have gotten this far through abusive parents and now through BPD affected relationships. You can get through this as well. 

You are worthy of love and the most effective place to get that is in yourself. I know how cliche that can sound and how hard it can be for us to even know what that looks like, but loving yourself means taking care of yourself. It means sometimes simply closing your eyes in a quiet space and imagining that hurt child whose caretakers failed to protect her and were even the ones who hurt her. Wrap your arms around her and tell her you know she wasn’t protected. You know she was hurt by those who were supposed to love her, but YOU are here now and YOU will protect her. You will provide for her and you will love her. Because she deserves love and you deserve love. Period. 

The sooner your little girl inside begins to feel safe and loved by you, the sooner she (and you) can heal. 

Do it right now. If you’re at work, go to your car. If you’re at home, take a break in a quiet room. I personally like to take a warm bath and turn off the lights and put on some white noise or some healing kind of music with no words so I can focus. And do this for you. Do this for her. TALK TO HER. Console her.

1,"Don't be upset! It is a rude way speaking about people suffering from bpd. Selfharm can for example also occur during depression and then it can also be seen as a desperate cry for help. What people usually don't get is that the pain really kills them inside and hell what to do if noone and nothing helps? Sometimes even mental health services refuse to help if you don't at least try to commit suicide  (depending on the country you live in). Some people starve themselves to death cause they really need help. There is nothing wrong with wanting help, and it is not the intention of self harmers to manipulate people. And being told exactly such bullshit is what makes them even more mentally sick. Cause it says your pain doesn't matter, has no place on this earth, it is not justified and thus your actions (SH) is manipulation. Someone saying that hasn't understood nothing especially not what consequences such bullshit saying has. 
I'm sorry it upset you and I know there are a few people around that think that way (even some therapist). I doubt they have every been in such deep pain to have to selfharm.

0,"short answer: extremely open and frequent conversations about behaviors, a little bit of grace and maturity. 

long answer: I was diagnosed with BPD at 19, but it's been suspected since 16. now I'm married, in a ""normal"" healthy relationship. I no longer meet the DSM 5 requirements. I'm not going to pretend that I don't still really struggle at times, because I do. 

what has helped me the absolute most, is that my husband is smart, and a logical thinker. I entered our relationship telling him that I have BPD, he looked up unbiased information about BPD, read a few studies, joined a Facebook group I was in so he could see how other people with BPD act and feel. another thing in the same vein as seeing and hearing about how people with BPD act, he would come to therapy with me! he actually suggested multiple times ""maybe we should bring this up on your next session?"" or ""could you schedule a session, you're not doing well."" and as hard as that is to hear, if you force yourself through that anger and sadness, and go to the session or make an earlier appointment, you tend to see more results. as people with BPD, we don't normally feel outside of this very moment, so you gotta strike while the iron is hot and what not. 

another thing is being held accountable for your reactions, but not necessarily your thoughts. the way you react to thoughts are solely your responsibility, but the reason why you had the thought in the first place isn't on you. example: early in the relationship I had a flashback to how my ex abused me, and the way I reacted towards him wasn't okay. at the end of the day my husband isn't my abusive ex boyfriend. we can see how that connection is logical, but they have no idea. this is where a little grace comes in. your partner has to be a little lenient ""yes the way you acted wasn't okay, but we talked through it now. I understand a bit better now. next time xyz."" for me personally, making plans on how to do something makes me think about it a lot, it gets ingrained in my head and then when a situation like that happens again, it's one of my first thoughts. 

my last tip that I tell everyone, even if they don't have BPD, is to not ask questions you want a genuine answer to. what if the answer is hurtful, you set yourself up. what if the answer isn't as good as you scripted, you set up those expectations. I'm talking about questions like do you think this person is pretty, what was your first impression of me, what would you do if I died, etc. yes the answer of those are sweet and give us satisfaction but more likely than not you already know what you want the answer to be. you want them to say no that person isn't cute because 9/10 it's someone who looks the exact opposite of you, but you want them to say yes so you have a reason to split. 

it takes a lot from both people. I've spent plenty number of nights sobbing in my husband's lap because he wouldn't let me react the way I normally do, and it feels like a genuine pain, I'm having to sit with those thoughts and feel through them instead of splitting and avoiding the feeling altogether. he has spent many hours secretly upset with my reaction and waiting for me to calm down so he can get reassurance that I still love him. there's going to be fuck ups. you're going to have your feeling hurts, so will your partners. there's going to be days where you feel like you haven't gotten any better but your partner has seen amazing improvement and is so proud of you. just for the love of everything holy, talk to each other. if there needs to be a code word you use as that fire starts, so that you can walk away from the conversation until you're better, so be it! I use the word pomegranate. this is possible and I wish you nothing but luck. I hope you show yourself a little grace in this process as well. no one else could ever imagine how having a disorder that feels like second degree burns over most of your body feels.",kaprioara,1c63vle

0,"Hey. I’m in the U.K. so can’t help with therapists in your area etc, but the ones you’ve seen sound appalling, and shouldn’t be practising. 

I have various personality disorders and PTSD, and yes, I probably will be on medication for the rest of my life (I’m 34 now and I started when I was 16). To be honest, I can’t even imagine life without them. They make me better. Why would I stop taking something that makes me better? Work on removing that medication stigma, and try to accept that medication can be a good thing.

Everyone is having a horrible time at the moment, and I think it’s especially hard for those of us with mental illness to endure. We’re lonely, claustrophobic, anxious, and some of our coping strategies have been removed. It’s natural that you’re feeling extra poorly at the moment. Let yourself accept that things are going to be really rubbish for a little while, but don’t forget that this will end. And you will have good days again.

I was very lucky around six or seven years ago and was offered ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy), and it changed my life. I still struggle, of course. I bloody posted here last week because I cut myself! It was the first time in two years, though, and of course I’m struggling with the lockdown like everyone else. But on the whole, it has allowed my recovery. It’s very peculiar because it forces you to lean into your trauma and accept it, rather than fight it (which is what we’ve spent all our lives doing, right?). But it works. There’s also a programme here called STEPPS which is used for those with PDs who aren’t as far into their recovery. Have a look into both these therapies/programmes and see if someone near you might offer them (when lockdown is over).

Please take care of yourself.",Unusualbellows,fxe0xe
1,"Join support groups, keep up with forums like this, research even more into it for your own good and peace of mind. 

Growing up and before getting diagnosed with my own stuff, I really enjoyed researching the shit out of things that interested me. Mental health being one of them. I knew something was up with me very early on and THANK GOODNESS for the internet because before all this met neutrality went down and internet life was actually bearable and relatively “fresh”, I was able to explore my mind and wackiness through research and actually allowing myself to feel and think the things I did. I just didn’t tell anyone. I’d read, watch videos, and ask google more and more to kinda get a sense of what I was going through, for my own peace of mind... because if I at least understood and accepted what I was going through, than that’s okay and enough. Because no one actually knows what we’re thinking or feeling unless we physically and vocally do so.. 

It became my own sacred secret. And that was okay and is okay for me because I also learned fairly quickly that the human condition alone is a very complex one, let alone one that is naturally made with an imbalance (which is also okay), so I’d just have to make sure that I was keeping it in check the best way that I could without letting fear, shame or guilt get in the way. 

Granted, that’s a bit harder now with having to grow up and transition to full blown adulthood. But it’s a great concept and sort of “light” to look to. You are who you are because that’s how youre biologically made. But you get to decide how you treat yourself and how you want to show up in your life, day to day. Even if it’s something unique each day. Just as long as you  work towards building a balance, a blue print to how you yourself need to survive and thrive. 

That includes letting go and REALLY not giving a fuck about what people think about you. Do what’s right for you so long it doesn’t hurt anyone or offend anyone. 

Honor yourself. Love yourself with your flaws and all. Because at the time of death that is all we have, ourselves. 

You have FULL reign over your body. Over your mind. Over your heart. Just because it’s been a tough fight, doesn’t mean you’re going to lose. 

Idk if you watch Naruto or anime at all, but if there’s one think I’ve gotten so far from Naruto is that each day, each moment brings a new challenge. Whether it be mental, physical or spiritual. Whether we’re ready or not, equipped enough or not. The important part is to show up and fight. Give your best and your all, regardless if you win or lose. 

Life is a win/lose game. It’s a matter of what we learn from it and how we use it to keep going. Because dude, as crazy as some days may feel living with this, we also experience some pretty dope amazing things! That wouldn’t be the same if we were normal! 

Kinda like Hannah Montana too 😂 best of both worlds! 

Make the most out of it love! Even if it hurts like fucking hell sometimes. It’s okay. We don’t like a lot of thing, but we still get through it because we have to. 

Don’t be afraid or ashamed. You’re you and you are trying! And that is enough!

Also, don’t give up on trying to find a good match in terms of healthcare and therapy. I’ve yet to find a good match, and even though it’s made things relatively worse in some aspects, I don’t wanna give up. And you shouldn’t either. You deserve to live a full life.",betsyletsy,fxe0xe

We just have to work extra hard on our end to stay constantly aware of ourselves and how we perceive whatever current situation we are facing that is triggering us. The best possible skill you can learn is respect boundaries both your own and the boundaries of others. For us, a lot of it comes down to communication. How we convey and receive to and from our loved ones. We have to work extra hard to remind ourselves that we need to trust and know our partners love us. And on their end they have to also be willing to stay healthy and regulated as well as taking part in either personal or group therapy. The truth is… we are a tall order. But we also, have the innate skill to love… if we remind ourselves why we are doing this, it’s all out of love.
I myself am entrenched in a battle that is slowly degrading my partners will to keep going. 
I’ve decided to take space after a big blow up.

One time, I even forgot is moms names, and when I say one time, probably for over half our relationship. I felt like I knew it, I felt like I was digging so hard in my brain to find the answer but it just wasn't there. That's how it feels everytime. Sometimes I have dissociative episodes, but not daily. Could that be why, or could there be another reason for such strange memory loss? ",haleyboofaith,6v8url
1,"I think that my own memory loss is created from being over stressed. With BPD we experience emotion pretty intensely, and it's easy to get worked up, especially when attachment and emotion is on the line. This emotionally triggered stress creates the stress hormone cortisol within us, that in turn, inhibits memory creation. Historically, we are built to forget the intense panic and fear of being chased by that predator or fighting for our lives.  Our wiring has patched over some broken parts in our childhood, or whatever events defined us, so we associate the same intensity of running for our lives with talking to people we care about, or about or loneliness, or even whatever strong emotional attachment or barrier we have. Thus I have to take notes when speaking to my spouse about our relationship, because without it I'm only left with a memory of the emotion or feelings and not a memory about what we talked about.

One that you already know you will not repeat (by changing the location of your notes master copy or at least creating a new draft to no one). It sucks and I get the humiliation and anticipation of the fallout and repair. 

That being said, it sounds like their statement is a little passive-aggressive or at least inappropriately reactionary. In other words, maybe they let their emotions run them on that. That's on them. Their reaction is NOT on you. The fact that there was that reaction/verbiage from a professional is concerning. I will cautionly state that not all therapists are good therapists (something like up to 30% actually cause harm), so this is a good time to keep good notes. Personally, if this happened to me, I would probably let them know how their reaction left me feeling in our next session since I'm sure there will be a conversation. I would be very interested and observant of what position they take and how they handle it. If they are anything less than professional about their actions (take accountability, apologize, and make space for constructive conversation and understanding), I'd seriously consider looking around for a better therapist. I would like to be clear, I'm not advocating to run out and get a new therapist or quit without trying to work through it. Just don't sell yourself short, either. Your therapist is the front line to showing you how people should treat you (even during adversity) and what good boundaries look like and work like.

So when i feel rejected and you can feel it physically hurting inside, ill go “hey. Im here, youre ok.” And kind of mind myself as if im someone else. It probably sounds nuts but its really helped. Also by treating yourself like youre talking to a child, you stop blaming yourself for shit, you stop talking down to yourself all the time. You turn yourself into your own parent and do what your parents didnt do for you. Its hard and it feels weird dont get me wrong, but it kind of helps me realize i dont need anyone to validate me or constantly reassure me that theyre not leaving me. Because the thing about constantly asking someone else to reassure all the time is that, youll usually feel like youre a burden on them and it probably does put pressure on them to mind you instead of minding themselves. And also, no matter how many times someone else reassures you, youre probably not going to feel any better, and if you do itll be for a very short time. You are great and you have to believe that youre great. It takes alot of work to get through the constant fear of abandonment. But trying to reparent yourself helps, i think.

Educate yourself first and then teach your friends ways they can help you personally and then be willing to be helped! 

bpd is a highly varying disorder n the most you can do is try to make sure people understand the most important symptoms for *you*. 
For me it’s my black and white thinking. I imagine this is the same for a lot of us but I’ve noticed this has been the hardest thing for my friends to understand. Teaching people that I struggle to work with grey areas or even acknowledge them sometimes was initially really hard but over time people have started being super helpful w my emotional range, emotional threshold and my general social ability. 

My FP/BF and I have worked on it HEAPS and he’s been super patient w me without compromising his own boundaries (which is super important for people w BPD to stay conscious of!). He’s been rly good w reminding me when I’m freaking out for no reason in a gentle and kind way.

Before we had a way of communicating w each other he often felt overloaded by my emotions n v often felt like he had a lot of pressure on his shoulders.

remember that you are doing the complete opposite and you’re being vulnerable with him even when it’s hard and you’re being so strong sharing your feelings with him and even trying to improve your relationship, honesty is the first step in having a healthy FP relationship 

I had an online FP once and to try to make it a little healthier we would set specific times we could talk or call especially on days that are busy, I noticed that having time stamps of a call or a video chat during my day would give me something to look forward to so I wouldn’t be on my phone 24/7 waiting for him to respond to me.

Also, having identities away from each other like separate friend groups and hobbies (although ik it’s so tempting to absorb their life and personality) helps in lessening any tension as he will feel like he is able to be independent and that will bring you closer.

E- express (using “I” statements to express emotion)
A- assert (Clearly state what you want/ need with specifics)
R- reinforce (reward the other person if they respond well)
M- mindfulness (being mindful of your goal without being distracted by other issues)
A- appear confident (using clear words online etc)
N- negotiate (know your limits with the person)

I hope any of this helped and if you ever need to message anyone my dms are open <3",bbygothh,twni7w
1,"Thanks for replying! This definitely helped me! You suggested that we would set a specific time that we can call. I don't think I'm brave enough to ask that since I think that would put a burden on my FP and he may not want to and I feel like I have annoyed him too much already.

1,"For me, it helped to have a diagnosis because I always knew something was very wrong with me but didn't have the vocabulary to describe the terrifying happenings of my brain. However, for the most part, a lot of therapy for mental illnesses is all very similar and uses similar techniques. Even neurotypical people respond well and have better lives when learning DBT techniques and mindfulness, for example. You might hear people mention the DBT workbook by Marsha Linehan. Whether you get diagnosed or not, I reccomend trying it out, because it has some good skills in it for basically anyone and is very helpful for people with DBT specifically. Mindfulness meditation is also very helpful, although keep in in mid that you don't have to meditate to be mindful. It can be a practice you have as you go about your idea. It's a state of mind, and can be very elusive, but it's easier to start with meditations. Body scans are especially good provided you don't have chronic pain. Hope this helps! Remember, you're the same person you always were, and there are many people with BPD who go on to love happy lives. In fact, some psychologists think that BOD may be an unborn sensitivity to others emotions and actions that can be a skill when you develop it in a positive environment. There's a possibility that the reason it effects people negatively is because they may never be taught to use it in positive ways or because they experience trauma that ""activates"" it in a negative way. There are positives to any mental illness, even though they don't outweigh the negative parts. In people with BPD, we tend to be more creative, sensitive, and empathetic, although it's different for everyone. Whatever happens with your paychiatrist/ A diagnosis, I hope you find something to help you.",Cobalt-Royal,hsllun

I feel this so much. I'm right behind you in this, but I'm a year older and BPD wasn't considered until recently. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and ADD in middle school, and my story is very very similar. I essentially study psychology as a hobby now and I suspect I have BPD, AvPD, and/or ASD. I'm currently working on getting an assessment, I have a really great psychiatrist for the first time in a long time and have finally found the right meds, she's also the one who suggested BPD but she seems reluctant to diagnose me with anything. When I've said anything about autism she basically just says I'm neurodivergent and leaves it at that, although she has suggested that I take an ADHD assessment despite the fact that I was diagnosed with ADD twice before I was 17. I just know with my whole being (and I dont say that lightly) that there's something more than the diagnosises that I've carried into adulthood.",ived_nella,hstx4w
3,Very similar experience and when I finnally got diagnosed instead of being told it's just anxiety I was also worried about not getting things right as that might have been the reason I was dismissed before.

Whenever you did something wrong and realized it ,take some time to talk with yourself.Close your eyes and imagine as if you traveled through  time and changed the way you wanted to.This is the trickiest part that you have to decide how you could handle in other way if you get another chance.Once you are done ,it is probable that next time you will react with the part of your imagination.

0,"I'm looking from the outside and I'm male and bloody old so sorry I don't fit what you want and I completely understand wanting to speak to someone similar to you. I have been in a relationship with someone who suffered a lot, various attempts to end it, plus they suffered from DID as well as PTSD.

Deep breath.

You need to vent a bit somewhere safe. Even the odd primal scream in the woods might make you feel a bit better, not a cure but it might take the steam out a bit.

Other than that you really need someone to talk to where any fear of hospitalisation isn't present. No friends that might be that non-judgemental ear? Depending on where you are there are also some good help lines or PTSD charities that might be a good ear too.

The ideation to end it? Of course, I might be taking a risk here but I see that as a normal part of the process of being you. It doesn't always last and is really driven by a deep desire to NOT be you and you can only say that because of the memories you have that are negative. Again completely understandable. Just be aware that it can spiral downwards as a repetitive thought. That's very exhausting to have those thoughts every time you feel triggered or down.

Here's one key that applies to people having too many thoughts creating a desire to control or suppress them. Suppressing them can be the problem more than those thoughts actually exist being the problem. The tremendous desire to suppress them is probably more exhausting than having the thoughts in the first place! In other words, those thoughts are stressful when you're inside of them. They seem real and valid. If you manage to find a moment of peace and suddenly those thoughts come, look at them as if they are just a machine working in your head to try and make yourself feel in control. Let it go. It's going to happen anyway. The thoughts will come, and they will go. Allow them to go even if they seem stubborn and are sticking around. Put them in a place where you realise they are not who you really are. They are like a machine kicking off when the on button has been pushed. Kind of like a knee jerk reaction of the brain. You can practice this every day just by being aware of it rather than trying to control it. Be aware of it but it's really just babble in the background.

There is another part of you that isn't this. A deep and relevant part that can access something else other than thinking about bad thoughts.

With the PTSD you can try some of the trusted and true methods that bring your attention to the things around you. When you feel yourself going into a PTSD mode do things like look at the walls and their colour. Describe the light in the room. Use sensing as a way to connect with the reality of where you are rather than the thoughts in your head. Run cold water over your hands is another good one. It focuses your brain on the relevant and immediate world.

Much love.",NeerImagi,17yxzr7

Yes, what he did or is doing is messed up, but you’re engaging in the same behaviors and tolerating it. You’re focus is currently on a “type” and still avoiding the self work that needs to be done to achieve a healthy relationship. What values do you have/want? What do you like or dislike about yourself and others? How do you feel regarding these things? In order to stop putting yourself in these situations you have to address the underlying need your trying to get met, address what emotions your afraid of feeling, and what beliefs are causing cognitive dissonance. If you want a good partner, you have to be a good partner. A healthy individual will not want to engage with one that is unhealthy.

Stopping medication straight away can be really dangerous. If your doctor said the hives weren’t caused by your meds, I would urge you to continue taking them.  

Judging by the content of your post, I would likely assume that the hives are a stress response, it happens to me often when I’m in high stress situations. 

I know right now it feels like you’re stuck and nothing will give you relief, but your stress responses will calm down over time. Just take it hour by hour and do whatever it is you can do to make yourself feel better. Your partner is in a safe place, and he needs you to be in an equally safe place. Psych holds aren’t forever, and once he’s been assessed etc, I’m certain they’ll let him call. It’s not a prison, they don’t wanna punish you. Just try and focus on you for a little while. If you need to cry, or scream or sleep for 20 hours, do it. Just treat yourself with kindness.",jaycakes30,1cs661z
1,"I just wanted to say, thank you so much for your response, it means the world to me genuinely. 

After a while of thinking about it more clearly, it does seem like the hives might be a stress response, today the hives were gone and I do feel slightly calmer so it’s likely to be connected. I do understand stopping medication can be dangerous, I’ve given it more thought and managed to get some sleep so I think I’ll call my psychiatrist again today and hopefully schedule something. 

I hope they do let him call but until then I’ll just try my very best to distract myself or sleep through this all. The emptiness and the separation anxiety is just really hard right now but I’ll do my best to stay away from anything he wouldn’t like me doing.

1,"Hooray for your first post (sorry it came out of desperation)!!! I'm so sorry you're going through it! Gosh, I can really relate to the loneliness of all that secretive si and attempt. It's such a hopeless place to be!!! And even more so when those in our lives can't/ won't help, or make it worse somehow. It sounds like you might need a different type of support in your life than what you currently have. (Easier said than done, I know...trust me I know.) I don't have any magic solutions, but here are some things that helped me at different times that could be helpful to look into, or hopefully even just distract you for a little while:
* Patrick Teahan is personally my favorite and has the most content. https://youtube.com/@patrickteahanlicswtherapy?si=xyLPH_H-FwQh8ZJS
* Dr. Kim Sage is very calming. https://youtube.com/@DrKimSage?si=I4UsdHF9AtueHxUe
* Dr. Fox is very practical, but sometimes his face bothers me, so I just listen to his stuff 😉
https://youtube.com/@DrDanielFox?si=ZnsBzlcWyJcbg1Uk
(All of them have content on other platforms as well.)
* If you struggle with self-harm, this is an alternative list of things to try to avoid self harming, and it is a loooooong list. https://projectlets.org/alternatives-to-selfharm
* This bpd sub has been particularly supportive and validating, and I encourage you to ""let it out"" here.
* Therapy/new therapist if you have access. Same with psychiatrist if you have comorbid issues that require meds. 

Also, I understand people have reactions, but out of concern for your health, I just want to say that your partner's reaction to noticing that you ""messed with their 'stuff'"" is concerning to hear. I don't hear concern for you in ""now I can't even keep these here"" - however, I do hear them shaming you in what was relayed. (I do think it's better the weapons aren't in the house for some time but that's it's own thing)...AND It's no wonder you're having a ""reaction"" and probably having trouble regulating. Sometimes people don't realize they speak a certain way toward others, and sometimes ""we"" don't pick up on it b/c often we've been conditioned to accept ""less than."" I just thought, based on your post, it might be a useful conversation for you and your partner to have or revisit when you felt comfortable so that maybe the next bad situation doesn't go from bad to worse. 😬 Shame and BPD don't generally mix well. 

I've struggled with mental health issues my whole life, been in therapy for 25 years - dozens of medication trials and various treatment modalities later I'm still sitting in a near constant state of wanting to die, too. I'm trying to figure it all out, too. I hope something in the list helps, and if not, at least we can suffer together. 🖤",LongMedia7072,17xi547

I've overcome a lot and learned a lot about myself over the years, and I feel like I can have some kind of control of my my bad habits. I think this times it's because I feel everything is going...perfectly? And it's never felt this good, so I think that's why I'm trying so damn hard to avoid bad things from happening.

0,"Oh, I hear you. Thanks for sharing. I don't have an answer for you ask I dumped my family in 2014 for what was supposed to be a temporary therapeutic time but turned into, phew am I ever glad you are all out of my life permanently time. I still talk to mom and she's probably the worst, but you know, you don't ditch your mom. Distance is key, you have to be nice which is super annoying, but good practice, and yeah I am not really going to provide great advice here, just that I fully identify with this. Don't take their bullshit is the number one, and feel free to disengage and do something you really enjoy instead of having horrible conversations on repeat or not getting the effort you put in back. Reward yourself for your own efforts, don't wait for validation because, and this is the worst reality ever, but it may not come.

My family doesn't know about my mental health, they're all pretty ignorant. I found it really best to just reduce contact with all of them- I mean, you don't have to fully cut them off (I did cut off my dad though, and it's been years and I still feel really solid in the decision, and he still sends me money and weird emails sometimes regardless of requests that he not, and I still have never changed my mind).  

I feel like those generations have romantic notions about family and it just doesn't mean the same thing to me at all- I mean keeping in mind that our parents like ""had"" to make up with their horrifically abusive parents for our sake, and (in my case anyway) even though that didn't make anything really better I just had to deal with a drunk dad *and* his drunk dad, they want that, they want the fiction, and resolution, and probably they do just love you too.  But, more likely they at least partially think you owe them something, which is kind of like love? really not.  I don't owe my family shit, and they aren't even the worst, I just don't. 

I started limiting the amount of contact I had with my family over many years and just stopped allowing their bullshit to impact me in my adult life (this is obviously impossible being in the same house and I am so sorry you have to I haven't done that for years and can't even imagine what it would be). This started with not talking to family about other family members (as in inter-familiar gossip), and then yeah it really was an i've had enough never again thing with my dad, and pretty much everyone disowned me for that so it made it pretty easy really. I don't know, every once and a while there is a random phone call and some backhanded comment and i'm like, you know, you are all just making a case for me never speaking to you again, bye.  I just stopped taking it.

Maybe that is just a major cop-out, but truly, my family has so much trauma, we could talk for literally decades and I don't think we'd ever work through it, nor do I even really want to. I truly just feel better and more emotionally stable when I don't have relationships and I don't know that that will ever be communicated to my family without a wall of shame thrown at me, but i'm just like that, it's fine, it's better. We can talk sometimes, you aren't all dead to me or anything, it's just, not the same it's a different kind of relationship we have now, one that I have a lot more agency over.  

I think, after many years, they finally got it and started being a lot nicer.  I think they realized that they literally would not have a relationship with me at all, and that this wasn't a symptom of me being young and irresponsible, it was a choice, a very difficult one, to divorce my family, and it really worked out for me. So things are a lot better, but had I stayed? Had I accepted that I would have to go to my aunt's house bi-annually bc it was too hard to stay in the city, or kept pandering to my dad's drinking and adult-baby bullshit? i'd still be doing it, I know it.  I'd be unhappy and co-dependent and the relationships I would have chosen outside of these unhealthy relationships would also be bad. So, if it is feeling impossible right now, it's likely because it is, and just take comfort in knowing that it will be over soon at least and you can work on those relationships from a distance soon.  


I took a lot of distance from most people I was close to when I was diagnosed BPD- I still don't fully understand why or how my relationships were disregular, and having no relationships (or many casual relationships which is more the case now) was an important part of figuring that out at least partially.  When I did this I went through relationship relapse and bounced around a lot of shit people for a while out of total boredom, but eventually it got old and the patterns were much more obvious and I did see how ridiculous I am sometimes.  I feel that had I not removed extraneous stress I would not have come to those realizations and probably would just have continued the abusive patterns that I learned growing up.    


I'm not saying don't waste your energy- people are worth your care, but I guess having different (lowered, almost none) expectations is a good approach? I feel like the changes in my relationships are pretty minimal actually, but I did some work to deal with how I process the things my family say to me, and THAT is a very difficult thing, and once that work is done, yeah it's easier.  I care less, I don't think about the past, I don't sweat the ""small things"" (they aren't small!!) bc I can't- it hurts, it hurts me too much, i'm maxed on hurt. I guess bc I had that long period of no contact, when the contact happened again it wasn't so intense. detraumatization can take a decade. Distance by choice not neglect is very empowering if you are, like me, a child of neglect. It's work that my dad never did or got to do, and that I remember also, it's not even really his fault you know? It's just also not my problem.    


Family, especially if your family are kind of assholes who never learned to behave, isn't always the most positive support system for ppl with bpd starting therapy.  Bc yeah, having them around is triggering as fuck. You are allowed to set firm limits and take your space to heal. Don't worry about mum, she'll be fine and she's there and she doesn't have to deal with having a mental illness right now, you do. 

If people ask what your deal is or enact anger or resentment, just state clearly ""yes, i'm sorry that I have been distant, I am taking some real time to focus on myself and improving my mental health. part of this is in relation to my relationships and I am finding it beneficial to have some distance from family members so that I can figure it all out.  I hope we can talk soon/again about this once I find the help I am seeking, I simply don't want to create conflict or damage our relationship in the process because it is important to me. Thank you for being patient, it may be a slow process and could take some time. Do you have other supports and people you can turn to about... so and so?... You know I am always here if you really need me, but right now it is important that I take space, thank you for respecting that.""  

They probably need space too. Sometimes engaging family members in a therapeutic exercise makes them understand your life and the work it takes to just function, and maybe also the differences in how you process things.  ""hey mom, I found this really cool new breathing or visualization technique, it only takes a couple of minutes, would you want to try it out with me?"" If they aren't responsive to this kind of effort (which, if you are like me and emotional regulation is almost impossible we know that is a loooot of effort) just run.  Disengage, take your space, just focus on you and make that your only focus for a while. It's not worth it, right now, to keep trying there. Set firm limits as to how much of your energy is going to the people around you and communicate them directly.   


It is different for everyone, but I found myself to be too vulnerable to be around anyone I knew following my diagnosis.  I changed cities, found places to be basically with other mentally ill people who were into leaving eachother alone, and was careful about who I interacted with and how, with many, many setbacks.  I just couldn't factor family into the equation at all, it was too necessary for me to get well, and I did, and my family was still there, just not so there that i'm in a trauma blackout whenever I think about them.   


Sorry for the essay, I hope that helps a bit anyway if only that I can relate.  I absolutely hate when people tell me to let shit go, without understanding that it is almost impossible for some people to do that, but I think for myself anyway it is less letting shit go and more not allowing myself to be re-traumatized and hurt by others' and this is a whole strategy that is more effective than just being like whatever, I don't care.  I always care, but it really only hurts me to care too much, caring less is good sometimes.",,kqnfuc

What is the best case scenario? 
He is completely interested in you only and wants to only spend time with you every second of the day but he has these pesky other people who talk to him and it's hard to keep them away. He even started using bug spray on them. He has different fly swatters that are color coded for each friend and he slaps them with those when he can't find the spray. 

You see, that's quite silly. But isn't your  worse case scenario too much? I think so.

5,"I am in love with a person with BPD and it’s easier for people to paint things as black and white rather than understand being human is complex. I’m constantly looking for information on how to help and be of support. I can’t say I’ve never fallin into ignorant thinking that he’s evil lol. Obviously it comes from the hopelessness after letting the episodes get to me. Plus my friends never having similar experiences can leave me isolated because it can be hard to share with them the intensity of it and them not judge me or feel sorry for staying. But meditation has been helping me a lot with letting things go and reviving the loving and supportive energy I know he needs. The more I educate myself and try to put my self love first. The quicker he diffuses and apologizes. I also try not to let him dwell in shame but rather to focus on solutions when he’s out of the fog. So I’m trying to become an example rather than try and fix him. It takes a lot of the pressure off of him which I feel can trigger the episodes. Also I ask the universe for guidance, strength and grace as often as I need and she never disappoints. If I don’t receive then I wasn’t paying attention. Also setting space while reassuring him I’m not leaving him helps. I know it hurts to reads those posts misinformed folks express. It annoys me when I look for help and the internet reads run, get out while you can. But people are just hurt they lost someone they hoped they’d have forever. Especially if it got dangerous so they had no other option than to leave. It’s hard to stay away from a dangerous situation when you have a lot of sympathy for it so people turn cold to protect themselves from a relapse. It’s easier to be angry than to feel hopeless. Anger= can’t be rejected. Plus western medicine is not as far along as people give it credit. This line also helps me

6,"Actually, reddit hates all cluster b personalities. Narcs, socio/psychopaths, us. I think they confuse hpd with bpd often, so them, as well. They just aren't aware. As soon as someone is lacking the slightest bit of empathy, someone has to point out npd or aspd. 🙄

I realize the seriously problematic issues of cluster b's, especially in relation to crime with sociopathy. Obviously not everyone with it is a criminal or violent person, but it is a concern.

However, most of them have been played up by media portrayals and people who assume their loved ones are the only example of people with bpd ever. It's tiring. I have ""quiet"" bpd, so people just think I'm naive and younger than I am... Until they really get to know me. Not that many people do. I'm careful about getting close to others.

It kills me that people will advocate for ""mental illness"" - - i.e. Anxiety and depression, until they are blue in the face. But other conditions, that are often comorbid conditions are overlooked and demonized.

9,"I didn't mean to make it sound that way.

What i was trying to say was that people with bpd can be abusive as much as anyone else can.

Pointing fingers at people with bpd is not helpful for either side as it enables harmful stereotypes, and making the coping with the trauma about the abuser is simply not a good way to cope. There's a reason trauma therapy exists and there's a reason why victims of abuse are not split up into groups by the mental health problems of their abuser. And there is a reason trauma therapy groups are led by professionals. 

If you want to simply be informed about why people with bpd share certain behaviours, looking in a subreddit that makes the abuse about the mental illness of the abuser the core of the sub, will not be helpful but harmful. In many cases, the victims will share their own personal view, which aren't accurate to the mental illness sometimes but to their abuser. Looking for information in a place where many people gather who are struggling with trauma unsupervised, will not make anyone informed. 

You're right, being abusive is not right. Neither is labeling a group of people as abusers because they have the same mental illness
And many of the people i have seen on the subreddit simply need trauma therapy with professional supervision, to understand that coping with trauma is about you and not about the abuser
Sorry for the confusion I'm having trouble to put into words what i mean when i get heated in the brain (also im not native English speaker so some of the things i say might sound weird) 

Anyway tl;dr 
It's not okay to abuse anyone 
It's not okay to reduce a person to their mental illness
Coping with trauma should be supervised by professionals 
People who were traumatised by someone with a mental illness shouldn't give advice about how to handle a person with the same mental illness 
People with mental illness shouldn't be reduced to the mental illness

0,"im so sorry you’ve been put thru this! I’m in the US but your experience rings true here as well. Most clinicians here are not trained in the diagnosis or treatment of BPD either and will not give you the most updated or accurate info about it.

I don’t know if this will help, but I think there’s a chance. There’s a place in New York City called the BPD Resource Center. I don’t live in NYC but I asked if they knew of any clinicians in my city that they would recommend and they gave me a whole list. I’m waiting for an intake appointment with a clinic they recommended. Theyre well known and respected and so may know of clinicians in the UK or at least some kind of equivalent UK organization that would have that info. It’s so frustrating when you’re actually trying to seek treatment and keep running into roadblocks. I wish you luck

1,"""NHS"" stands for ""National Don't Ask Don't Get Help Service"" (somehow). You have to find out exactly how the system works for your particular problem you're experiencing in your area. What's the process? Who runs that step in the process? Where are they located? What criteria do they expect me to meet to be eligible?

Then you need to ask and ask and ask until you get what you asked for. Particularly so for mental health.

GPs are generalists. They know a little about everything. One thing they know very little about, even those who say they're mental health experts, is borderline (aka emotionally unstable) personality disorder. Part of the reason for this is that the behavioural traits are so often hidden to everyone but a small group of close friends and relatives or the person's partner that it would never be evident to a stranger in a public setting.

In many NHS trusts the people you want a referral to are the ""complex needs service"". Find out if you have a version of that. If you're desperate for an official diagnosis that can usually only be issued by a psychiatrist and in some cases a clinical psychologist. Research the difference between the two.

 So I don’t know if I have the best advice but I would suggest a few things. One is that there is a web site https://www.nyp.org/bpdresourcecenter that’s an online resource center for bpd and I’m sure they have suggestions on there and there’s also a crisis number I think, I don’t know if it’s different from a suicide hotline or not. 
 Also you can look up dialectical behavior therapy techniques and start doing some on your own, that’s what the woman who assessed me recently suggested until I can get into a therapist. 
 Other than that there’s all the distracting stuff that might help, regular exercise, hobbies etc. I know those aren’t always useful in the midst of an episode or breakdown though but at the least it can be ways to give your brain more dopamine which can be beneficial. 
 Another thing, I know this is not easy either, especially when your suspicious of how they really feel, but trying to talk to your boyfriend, trusted friends and or family can be helpful. If you can allow yourself to be vulnerable and open with them it can work as a sort of exposure therapy. 
 It all takes work and dedication because it seems so hard to control ourselves or our emotions but we can do it! That’s all the advice I can think of off the top of my head, I hope some of it works and I hope you can get into to see someone soon.

0,"I don't know that either of these 2 points will bring you real comfort but

People with borderline have had physician assisted deaths in countries where that is offered. May be no surprise.

Second is that DBT is designed to recognize that life is not always ""worth living"", and feeling as you described may be a life that's not ""worth living"" (why else would you be desperate for escape?). One point is to focus on that reality and risk , managing to cope with new tools while building the relationships, meaning and habits that can sustain a life you chose.

I can't say why your psych tells you ""you're doing well"", whether it's communication on your part, or perhaps just the limit of their validation and awareness. The fact you were previously on 5 medications at once is a small concern and maybe suggests that wasn't right care for you; in general fewer meds= better recovery for pwBPD. I can't assume you have access to other care providers or treatment programs, but possibly a higher level of care, partial hospitalization or intensive outpatient would fit; or a different treatment approach would be a better match for you. You find the group setting increases your anxiety and emotional avoidance or dissociation?

3,"Hi, Thank you for your thoughtful reply. 

I think my psychiatrist thinks I'm doing well compared to how I am when I'm admitted as an inpatient. I'm not sure that's a very fair benchmark though. I feel like she thinks my current level of suffering is acceptable because it's presenting as an improvement on where I was before. But it's always going up and down and honestly, even with the few moments where my mood is at its best, it's still not worth the remaining 99% of the time which seems to range from extremely difficult to absolutely unbearable.

I wasn't able to leave the house, but now I can sometimes with immense distress and difficulty. I'm still having crazy mood swings that I can barely manage. Just because I'm not aggressively trying to kill myself all the time and dont require constant surveillance doesn't mean I'm doing better enough to be left without help. She's refusing to prescribe any more medications because of the bad reactions I've had but honestly I would try anything at this point, even more bad drug reactions if it meant that this was not the level of normal I would be settling with for the rest of my life. I just feel like as long as I'm not immediately going to kill myself, that seems to be good enough, which seems cruel and disappointing. As things are, I don't know how much longer I can survive like this. 

I cycle through these suicidal loops so often that when I come out, I know I didn't really want to die, I just wanted to know that there was a possibility of a way out. This hope is difficult to hold on to when you're constantly told to just go to therapy when it's clearly not addressing your current level of distress at all.",sarahthehumanperson,i2asxt

I don't want to say the cliched line 'I'm sorry you're going through that' which seems to be the standard automated response to someone sharing their pain, because it never makes me feel any better.

We don't need to be going through the exact same thing but just being able to be honest about how terrible things are and meeting in the middle through our mutual suffering is enough. I don't want to minimise how unique your situation is, but I will say that I definitely share a sense that I'm living purely out of obligation to my family and also that it feels pretty much impossible for me to feel any positive emotions, enjoy anything or relax completely without self-judgment, fear or paranoia setting in. I'm very inconsistent because of my moods (and I avoid interaction if I'm acutely anxious, depressed or angry), but would be happy to chat to someone with shared experience.

I'm not trying to be a jerk, I just want to make sure we're using the same terminology.  


Regardless of your illnesses, what this all comes down to is triggers between the two of you. Do you know what they are? How do you cope in certain situations? What kind of techniques do you use to self-soothe? You mention he's on meds; are you on meds? Are either of you seeing a therapist? If he's in a bad spot, can you support him even if that means you might be triggered and could send you spiraling? Can he support you?  
 

Having a relationship with a normal joe and someone whose crazy is hard. When you have two crazies, it's even harder because its a constant check and balances. And while relationships can be hard even if you're ""normal,"" you're easily looking at twice the work when mental illness is involved. If you think he's beyond worth it and could be someone see a future with, make the commitment. And not to say he's ""too much,"" but if you feel you cannot support him if he relapses or if there are too many risks involved, let him go.

2,"What an amazing reply!!! And not a jerk at all! Thank you so much. Sorry, yes I do mean Borderline Personality Disorder. I get confused with acronyms lol! I agree it is something that needs to be weighted. Especially as we have children on either side to take into consideration. I am medicated on Concerta and Mephylenidate. Which has seen an awful amount of my impulsive and emotional behaviours balance out. So, I would say I am the more level headed out of the two, well as much as an ADHDian can be. 
I am triggered by violent episodes around me, I am noise and smell sensitive. One occasion I jumped out of a window during an argument years prior to meeting my ex. The noise vibrates through my skull and feels like physical torture. Although my ex is like a hot Brian Blessed (loud no matter the mood) it wasn’t until I bought up missing money did his voice become even louder and more aggressive in tone. So, that’s my trigger. His trigger from what I can gather is his addictions being found out (gambling and cocaine), he had lied for months about needing money which me being me was like a walking bank. Then when I pulled my funding (don’t want to be an enabler) he became even more defensive. So less about the addictions and more about the need to lie. Coming from a background of mental health I would like to think I can understand him and his motivations. I lie too when I have been impulsive on Amazon and it has taken a lot of therapy to be honest not just with others but with myself. Couples therapy sounds like an awesome plan, I already have a therapist for my ADHDitude but I wonder if he will think this is an attack on his feelings? How are you and your husband now? I really appreciate the reply and it has definitely given me plenty to think about. I honestly believe that someone with borderline personality disorder is more than worth the effort. For you to feel absolutely everything to such a great measure, love, happiness, you don’t half suffer a lot. BPD and ADHD aren’t dissimilar, merely the reaction to emotional stimuli.

But my psychologist explained BPD and how it forms in terms 14 year old me would understand and I have yet to come across a better way to explain it on my opinion. He put it like this:

There is a childhood trauma, picture that is a splinter in your foot. And the childs environment is not emotionally validating and toxic, so the trauma is never processed through so it just festers and builds and keeps getting worse as time passes. So you get this splinter in your foot right? Trauma, particularly childhood trauma. Well then you dont take care of that blister, dont wash it or cover it or remove it, nothing. And you go walking around everywhere barefoot in dirty, unclean places okay? Emotionally invalidating and toxic environment. Well one day that splinter gets severely infected, swollen and hot and red with infectious puss. He said the splinter is the trauma, and the surrounding sore redness and infection is the BPD that developed. I am in no way saying one way or another as to if she might or might not have anything.

Edit: I'll actually add some context here. I have a BPD friend irl who understands why that one time when my SO asked for sex I actually just wanted to cry and cut myself, or that time when I started stabbing the butter because he wasn't using knives in it properly. And we can laugh about that to a certain extent. But no one without a mental disorder will ever understand. I hide my appointment letters when people come over, and I'm 'out' to a few people, but when they ask how I'm doing I make some shit up and feed them a bit about work or therapy or whatever but with the general feeling of 'Everything is great and my life is going well'. Because people don't want to know that it isn't.

Also, I find that if I talk about it with my SO too much, I end up using psychology terms too often and feeling like a crazy person. Words like 'dissociation' don't help. I use 'zone out' a lot instead to try to make it more relatable. Not sure if that helps.",,3fz33r

I've been incredibly blessed (or lucky, not sure which) to have a supportive family and boyfriend that I can talk candidly with about my inner struggles, therapy, etc. Then again, I'd probably talk about those to random strangers if given to chance (I have issues with boundaries and can't really judge when I'm being TMI).

They actually used different names when they talked - they used their middle names, because they thought it would keep people from finding out they were cheating on their spouses). At that time, I thought she had multiple personality disorder (or dissociative identity disorder?).  This was a period of about 5 years that I saw this come and go, and it was very weird.

The issue that's causing you anxiety is you're worried about others' trust and respect for you. This is really a two way street. Trust must be earned.

0,"The issue I would focus on first is your emotional outbursts. When you’re having them over thinking your partner is going to leave, it’s essentially a self-fulfilling prophecy. I’d ask your therapist for more info on this first. I highly recommend DBT. 

When you start to feel insecure, check the facts. Is it reasonable to yell and scream over a short pause before they answer a question? In reality, all it means is they are thinking about how to answer. Try opposite action- when you have the urge to be nasty to your partner, do something loving for them instead. 

If you can’t fight off the intense emotional response, have an action plan to stop yourself from having a full blown episode. 
1. Put ice on your forehead, stand and lean over with your head on the kitchen counter and take deep breaths, with your exhale longer than your inhale. 

2. Self-soothe with things that trigger your senses (music, soft blanket, candle, pictures of kittens, etc.) focus on the pleasant physical sensations one sense at a time.

I would also suggest starting with distress tolerance and emotional regulation. Once you are able to control the extreme emotions a little better, learning about interpersonal effectiveness was a big help for me. 

If you are new to DBT, give it a chance. The developer of DBT had BPD and because she was one of us, I tend to listen a little more. If you have tried DBT in the past, pick it up again and try to be as honest as you can with yourself. There is plenty of evidence that suggests DBT is one of the best treatments for BPD. With that being said, seeing a therapist, taking medications, and self-care shouldn’t be downplayed at all.

0,"I hate that this was posted 4h ago and nobody commented 😭

I hope you’re doing okay and haven’t done anything yet.

I know exactly how you’re feeling. This just happened to me too, 2 weeks ago. 

I wish I could give you amazing advice and some secret to making it all stop... my therapist did talk to me about doing things that release the same endorphins to  do that instead of hurting ourselves. Breathing deeply I guess does it! Running, exercising... I’m not sure what else to be honest. On my own post somebody suggested holding ice cubes (I can’t do this because of health reasons). Or using a rubber band on your wrist to snap. Somebody suggested sharpies and drawing where you’d cut... I don’t suggest this personally. I thought it was a great idea so I did it but then I ended up writing very hateful things on myself and though THAT night it helped me get to bed, the next night I ended up cutting and worse so I think because I still had stained skin of all these hurtful things and it just fueled me. 

Side note: I’d highly suggest trying something else for an anti-depressant! Every time I switch/stop my anti-depressants I go through exactly what you’re going through. It sucks, but finding the right one is vital. I used to take Citalopram and it was my favorite one feeling wise it stabilizes me the best - but I had physical side effects that made it impossible for me to continue taking it 😭",kulia808,gi0ltn
1,Antidepressants and bpd are a weird one. I tried 4 meds over the last 5 years and they all had dissociative effects that were super bad except the Effexor which is really helping me.  The first time I tried an antidepressant I left my house without telling my roommates for a week and broke in (with permission) to a friends empty loft apartment while he was out of town. I didn’t tell anyone where I was and just stayed at his place for a week with no food.,,gi0ltn
2,It sucks so bad. I can’t tell either if I’m reacting normally or if it’s because my health is so messed up. My antidepressants don’t currently work but my doctor thinks it’s because I’m not absorbing it because of my stomach issues. Which I get. But it means waiting it out ... sucks so bad,kulia808,gi0ltn
0,"oh my goodness!! hon im so sorry your friend is acting like not-a-friend. my honest to god advice? DROP HER. what friend FORCES their friends to pay for a trip out of the country without asking their consent first?? and on TOP of that, she wouldnt pay a measely 6€ for a meal, made a scene, blamed you for something she couldve easily talked to you about in private, and made you cry. that is so mean and i really wish i could give you a nice good hug, one where your tension leaves your forehead. you can try to talk to this friend again, but it is clearly apparent that she doesnt value you as much as you value her. 

my question: what do you get out of this friendship? could that need be met in another way with someone else?

I can confidently say that you don't have to keep all the pain and rage to yourself. Yes move on, but also don't deny yourself of finding closure within yourself or message that person for the final say. Your pain doesnt have to define you like this.

2,I'm really sorry what have to go through. Concerning your husband it sounds to me like he is depressed himself and that doesn't have to do something with you. As long as he sees you suffering and being in a bad place he might think what's the point in speaking to you about his pain it would only make you feel worse. Men usually are far worse in talking about feelings. So try to have empathy with him every time you start questioning his love for you. Him not doing things you ask for is also easily explained with depression. Your situation is really hard and I would also advise to do some therapy together. Suggest to him he can choose the therapist and that he doesn't have to stay with someone he doesn't like.,ClouldoftheNight,cdb9p9

How do you plan to go about it?

1,"I know what you mean when you say ""I always thought it would make others view meas less capable.."".          
 That thought did run through my mind. If I tell them what I experience will it make them walk on egg shells around me or make me seem unstable as an employee? Reason 1.) Personally I want mental illnesses to be openly discussed and to have more awareness surrounding them so there is no stigma. Reason 2.) I leave work sometimes. I have all sorts of panic/ anxiety attacks that unfortunately can dictate my behavior and that effects my job. 

 The reason I want to openly share with my work is probably because my job is a very ""family vibe"" and open about our personal struggles. We try and ask each other at the beginning of the week, ""What you need to know to be able to work with me."" Which gives us the chance to say things like ""My cat got sick this past weekend and I am very anxious about the whole process. So if I seem off with you all at work, that's why."" 

This idea to open up is still in the beginning stages of how I want to go about it because I don't want to make things worse. But at the same time, why not tell them? I am not ashamed of my BPD. It has caused me a lot of pain, confusion, and perseverance. 

How has that made you feel to keep your BPD ""hush hush"" with your parents?",mommasaidnoEm,chgaqw

I am glad you felt comfortable sharing such personal effects with those you love. I wish you the very best. 

To answer your question, growing up in a home where issues were better ignored than dealt with, there were a lot of unresolved feelings for most of my life;

3,"Idk if you'll see this cus this post is old but hopefully you do. Thank you so much for sharing, I feel a lot less alone from reading your life story. It's crazy how similar you are to me, minus the Christian background and not being accepted by your parents. I'm a lesbian but my parents told me before I ever even knew what being gay was that I would be accepted and my parents had no religious affiliations. But a lot of what you described growing up and how your felt is how I felt. I haven't had any drug problems or weight problems but I think it's mostly because my mom and all her brothers had drug addictions so I've always been really careful with that. But I have put myself in debt over $20,000 twice with my shopping addiction. I've also been asked a lot if I've ever been sexually abused but don't have any memory of anything. I'm sure I have BPD but I haven't been diagnosed. I've been misdiagnosed bi polar also but always knew that was wrong because my mood swings are caused by outer circumstances not chemical imbalance and because my sister is bi polar so I've seen manic episodes and I don't have those. My new therapist doesn't believe in diagnosis so I don't have any diagnosis she's just working on each thing I want to work on one at a time. Idk if that's going to be effective though or if you need a diagnosis to actually make progress with this?

1,"The thing about any serious mental health problem is that it basically puts your life on hold until it's been resolved/recovery.

I've had to accept that my life is going to proceed at a slower pace than other's simply because I have this enormous thing to deal with as well. Although I'm younger than you (25) I've also thought about having kids in the future and when I would like to do that. I recently broke up with my LT boyfriend and that felt like a massive step back in regards to how I thought my life should proceed.

Right now recovery is my top priority. I finally moved out my mother's house a year ago. I'm at university. I have not worked for years because of BPD. I'll be starting an 18 month MBT course in the new year. 

I'm just about holding it together right now, with a fuck load of support.

What I'm trying to say is that life is a ladder. We cannot just jump straight to the top, even if we can just about see it from where we are now. We have to take each step at a time, at our own pace, while constantly checking to make sure it's the right step.

3,"I also have awful memory issues, that I think have slowly gotten worse over the years (I was diagnosed 6 years ago).

Such as putting EVERYTHING in my calender on my phone, setting reminders for just about everything, writing stuff down where possible (and making sure they're in plain sight) etc. 

Stuff I mostly struggle with is who I told what (meaning I repeat myself a lot, I usually start stories with ""Did I tell you about x?"" To avoid that), keeping up with friends (sometimes weeks will go by without hearing from them but it'll feel like yesterday - I try to check my chats regularly for people I haven't caught up with in a while,  I never get movie/ show referances even when I've seen it multiple times (and if I haven't seen something in a while it's like watching it for the first time, only upside I see here lol), forgetting to feed my cats (don't worry, they remind me), forgetting to eat myself, or forgetting to take my meds, or doing those last 2 twice because I forget I already did them. 

There's probably a lot more, but I'm also crap at remembering stuff to give examples xD

7,"So w/ the amnesia thing. Are you saying amnesia dissociation is a thing? Or are you saying that as two seperate things? If so it sounds like I could possibly have that. I relate to literally every memory issue you just listed on there. Esp when you said ""you don't remember places you've been to."" I went to SC beaches many years when I was young. I""m only 19 now but I stopped going when I was ;probably about 7 years old. As much as I loved that place, there are certain details of the area I just can't remember. Like for ex, my mom mentioned that there is this one shop that we pass by all the time on this street, she even remembers the street name, but I don't. And maybe part of it was because I was young and wasn't paying attention to things like that, but you would think if we've been to the same beach area quite a few times I would've at least remembered what the shop building looked like but I don't. But she was talking to me about it because we were thinking about going back this year and she asked if I remember the shop and what it looked like and I just for the life of me couldn't remember. And the same thing will happen for college/school related things. I'll study for tests all day, and then can't remember a thing I studied the day of the test. And while keeping in mind even tho I only studied a couple of days, at least that's what usually happens, I would still think I would be able to remember at least a little bit. And I think part of the issue is I stay up all the night before, or the night before that sometimes it would be two or three nights in a row pulling an all nighter because I have really bad time management skills, but anyways, I would stay up all night then I would be so tired the next morning and my brain was probably so tired that I just couldn't remember anything which is really frustrating esp if the quiz/test/exam is a big part of your grade which that happened to me several times through my last fall semester. Which is why I had to drop out. But what is dissociative insomnia? I haven't heard of that. Since you haven't heard of it, if you want I can't ask my therapist or psychiatrist about that. They seem to know their disorders pretty well.",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e

9,"Well that might be a trauma response. My therapist talked to me about trauma responses last Friday and that's what that sounds like. If you did have abuse during your childhood, your probably trying to co er it up. I think it's your brain's way of a coping w/ the trauma is what I'm trying to get at. I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure that's what that is because that's how my therapist described what was going on w/ me. And you may have PTSD too because my therapist really does think I have that as we discussed last Friday as well. I say you might have PTSD because I know that is very much related to trauma response. I""m not trying to diagnose you wrongly, or just diagnosing you but it ius a suggestion tho. If you have a therapist/psychologist/psychatrist I would highly suggest bringing that up to them because when I brough it up it prety much clicked right away w/ my therpaist on why I was doing the things I was doing.",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e
10,"EXACTLY WHAT I GO THROUGH!!! So my therapist always ask if my dad and I or if my sister and I have had any arguments/fights/blow ups this week on Friday and I can never remember because I block it out. She told me that was most likely a coping mechanism thing. So that's probably what your doing too and you're probablt doing it unconscioulsy because I know I do it unconciously. And I'll forget so often that it'll be like ten mins after the argument even tho I'm still mad/frustrated whatever the negative feeling is, I'll ususally text my bf about it and I can't even remember all of the details of why I was mad in the first place.",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e
11,"Thank you! This was helpful knowing someone can relate to the issues I'm having. I also agree my memory is getting pretty terrible and the worst part about it is I'm only 19 and I have plenty of more years to go and I don't want it almost half gone by the time I'm in my 20's or 30's. I've mentioned it to my psychologist (or therapist? I've always been confused about what to call her) but anyways, she thinks its something related w/ BPD and I wouldn't be surprised either. I'll have to do some looking around to see if people w/ BPD have similar issues. But from the examples you gave literally EVERYTHING on this list I relate too. I hardly remember to feed my cat and the bad thing is she doesn't remind me when she needs to be fed. Thankfully my mom is there to help out w/ that part. But w/ other things, I try putting things down in my planner for college stuff that didn't work so I switched to setting reminders on my iPad/phone and that still didn't work because I have an issue where I ignore the reminder. It's like I see it so I acknowledge to myself that I see it but then I slide the notification up and then I end up either completely forgetting about it or not remembering until the night of when the assignment/paper and/or test/quiz/exam was due. Which can be extremely frustrating esp if it heavily impacts your grade. My therapist is usually good w/ coming up w/ solutions to my issues but this one we've been struggling w/ for quite a while. It would also happen during hs which is partially the main reason why I almost didn't graduate and I honestly probably wouldn't have if it weren't for my amazing counselor that I had there. But for the communicating w/ friends/family or just people that I'm close to I also have the same issue of ""Did I tell you about the time... or did I tell you this already?"" It's very frustrating and I feel bad for the person esp if I've said it a million times which will happen very often too. Although most of the people who I'm close w/ or talk to often have gotten used to it by now and know that I have this disorder so they're pretty understanding about it THANK GOD for that lol.  But for that situation I'm almost starting to wonder if I should write down the important stuff that I either want to tell, or have already told them so I don't have to constantly repeat myself. I also tend to forget things about important people esp when it comes to someone I'm dating. I'm trying my best atm not to forget the important things about the current bf that I have so I'm thinking I should write these things down.

12,"Thank you that means a lot!! And yes I know how you feel, it's weird like I said above this response, I'll block out fights and what not but I'll remember most of the negative things that happen in my childhood.

13,"Yea my exes would use that against me as well. Although of course I can't think of any examples where he used to do that to me but I know basically all of them but one did that to me. It was really frustrating. And when I was in school, all throughout grade school I would have a small friend group, all of them were girls, and they would talk during lunchtime or recess, and I would always zone out of the conversation because they would talk amongst themselves and they would never talk to me. I can't even think of one time where they actually sat down and had a real conversation w/ me which is pretty sad. And the only time it happened was when me and my best friend were alone at the lunch table and everyone else was absent or taking a test or doing whatever. But anyways something funny would happen and I would always ask what's so funny? and then because I would zone out I wouldn't remember what they said and they would always say the same shit to me, ""oh it's nothing, or nevermind"" and that pissed the lving daylights out of me. I was so angry and furious when they did that to me. And now my sister does that same sort of bs to me and because that's happened to me when I was younger I act like it's a big deal because it technically is since people did that to me, but she never understands no matter how many times my mom explains it to her. My mom used to do that as well but she doesn't anymore now because I told her what happened a couple of years ago and she understands why I act like that now. But my family does it to me too (family outside of intermediate family) and I don't talk to them about any mental health issues I have except for my cousin, well my one cousin.

Then you start piecing those together and get the memories back once you're emotionally ready to accept and deal with it.",kalamity23,ghd18e
20,"yeah I def know what you mean. I dissociate especially when there is more than one person speaking at a time. If I'm trying to interact with someone and there's too much going on I can't focus. I get easily overwhelmed and people don't really get it.  
I also used to dissociate when I was working retail jobs with artificial lighting and always caught myself zoning out staring to the only natural light source that would be in the establishment.  
I think its just a safe way for us to rescue ourselves when we're not content/overwhelmed. I've been more conscious of it and I've also figured out a way to work for myself and hold myself accountable.",,ghd18e
21,oh really it is? I had no idea it was a symptom of it. I'll have to ask my therapist about that to see if she knew that it was a symptom cause she said she also has bpd too. Where did you find out it was a symptom? Or did you find out from a doctor and they told you?,sophiebeanzee,ghd18e

27,"Since I've been in therapy and addressed this coming up, I've been told/recommended to try and catch myself in those moments. When you notice yourself drifting/spacing/leaving your body and brain, to notice and then use a grounding technique. Taking a few deep breaths, redirecting your consciousness to your feet, noting the sounds around you perhaps. Grounding can work differently for everyone, but I hope you can find whats best for you.  
I also started using a meditation app just sitting down 12-15 minutes either in the morning or the evening helps stabilize me.  
PS. sorry I'm slow to respond.",,ghd18e
28,"Hey np I respond late too! Lol. But my therapist who lead a group called DBT mentioned the grounding skill. She mentioned the bringing yourself back to center she said it was called being in the present moment, I forget the exact name but I remember that phrase being mentioned. I never really tried it. I always claimed that those types of skills never really worked for me. But I thought that because I was actually afraid it wouldn’t work. I didn’t really know if it would work or not cause I never really tried it. But hearing it from someone else who was outside of my DBT group and saying it worked for them, I might actually consider trying it this time! What’s the meditation app you use? Is it Headspace? Cause I still have a subscription that app. I’ve never used it. I paid for a subscription to it and then I checked it out cause I thought it was like a brain workout type of app but it was just the meditation stuff and at the time I wasn’t into meditation. But honestly even tho I’m not into meditation I might as well just try it. It couldn’t hurt plus I have a bf who’s very supportive in me with my mental health stuff so maybe I can get him to do it with me. But I think I might mention to my therapist p, current therapist that I have now that I need to work on those skills again. Maybe 5-10 mins each day or something like that.",sophiebeanzee,ghd18e
0,"You're chasing a label. Labels can be helpful for you to understand your problem. They can be helpful for other people to understand your problem. However, the box that you've been placed in by someone else is just that - it's a box. It's never usually as simple as someone having one problem and everyone's experience of mental health is unique. No two people with a labelled disorder are the same. 

Have you heard the statement ""all models are wrong, some are useful""? Well it's very true in the case of the DSM categorisations of disorders. Nobody is 100% BPD and 0% NPD because they share some traits. Nobody is 0% autistic. The DSM is actually more of a sensemaking framework than a categorisation framework. So there's not necessarily a right or wrong answer as to which pigeonhole a person fits into, it's just a way to try and make sense of the situation and help decide what to do next. 

Also, bear in mind that in a way the label gives you validation that you're right. In many cases NPD/BPD people were starved of validation from carers (especially parents) as children and many of their behaviours seek an outcome of validation, often from authority figures. Consider the idea that you could be seeking the validation of psychiatrists when actually it's more important that you recognise which patterns of thought are unhealthy and develop healthy coping strategies to manage them.

If you're being blocked from receiving treatment and going through a hard time I'm sorry for that. It can be difficult to know where to start with treatment. There are a huge number of resources online for  you to get started with helping yourself. If you're interested I can share some links. 

**TL;DR Drop the idea that a label is important unless it's stopping you from accessing treatment**",The_RealMe,gdqhxy
1,"It's great that you're getting a fresh evaluation and diagnosis, I can tell you attached you are to the label and how helpful it would feel to be validated.

Today, I would say that it is wrong and insensitive to people with a BPD diagnosis for you to claim a diagnosis you have not been given. The fact is that you might experience a different PD like OCPD or PD-NOS, it's also possible the feelings you shared are more related to other factors completely.

Good luck with the eval, you seem motivated to share and work with mental health professionals to validate your experience. Let us know how it goes",TranZeitgeist,gdqhxy
0,"There is lots of info out there. The more specific your conflict is, the more I can help you. What more specifically do you struggle with for time management/focus?",,grcziy
1,"Ok main thing is distraction. I’ll start on the work but because of ADD I’ll have really short attention span esp if it’s something difficult to read or if I don’t understand it. So I’ll take a break then I’ll sometimes take a nap because I’ll end up getting tired. So then I’ll end up doing work late at night. And I’m not sure how to make myself focus. Because if I take breaks I’ll end up making them too long. The other thing I have trouble with is keeping organized. I’ll put stuff where they need to be, but when it goes in my backpack even tho Ik where it is it just gets crumpled up and I’m not sure why. But there are other times where it’s about 5-2 mins towards the end of class and I’ll be rushing to pack my things away and I’ll just drop it in my backpack and they also get crumpled up that way. So there’s the organization in my backpack and then I have trouble with time management. So part of the problem is the nap thing 8 mentioned earlier, and the other thing is I have a lot of trouble following through with things. For example I forget if I stated this on my original post or not but my counselor and I had come up with an entire plan. This is the counselor at my college. She gave me a sheet and it had each day of the week plus the weekend days. And she had me write down every bit of hw info I had plus any upcoming tests/quizzes/exams. So I wrote that down and we blocked out chunks of time to do for each class period. Like we said “from this time to this time I would work on the hw from English” and so on. So we did that and that was that. But when I went home here’s what would happen the entire situation with the long naps would happen, and sometime si wouldn’t take naps but then if I had a test to study for as I said in my post I would take the time to type out my flash cards and because I’m a freshman in college I don’t really know how to study for tests and all of that for college. I didn’t realize it was different from hs. So I would spend hours sometimes all day and throughout the night typing stuff because there were so much info on the PowerPoint slides and each PowerPoint was about 25-40 sometimes up to 100 slides long and in each of those slides were lots of info so it was hard to pick and chose what to study which is why I spent so much time typing them out instead of studying. And that’s also partially why I got tired because of staring at the screen for so long and it was getting hard to concentrate cause of that and ofc as I mentioned earlier cause of my ADD. So basically my point is I’m not sure how to study for my tests so that I can manage that and also finishing my hw from my other classes so I can get it all done in time and still take breaks in between but not taking naps. Well not taking long naps anyways. So I hope this helps. I actually met to send this yesterday but I was pretty busy yesterday evening and all yesterday afternoon.

Also you can sit down and make your schedule of the kinda of day/week you'd like to have. Dedicate specific time to work on homework/study.

3,"I did actually mention this yesterday when I met with her. She said although it’s not technically her specialty in helping w/ organization stuff and coming up w/ plans for those who have ADD/ADHD, but she mentioned that there was an ADDA/ADHD coach and she thought that this would be useful because you can work on those sort things w/ them and more skills too. But she said until my parents and I decide what to do w/ that her and I could come up w/ a plan or some ideas at least and start going from there. And what’s the 2 min rule? I’ve never heard of that. I’ll take a look at the link you sent me. And I some what did that towards the end of last week. I downloaded this app called Things 3, and it’s a checklist type of app and I woke well w/ checklists so I thought it was a good idea. I mentioned this to my therapist as well and she told me as long as I keep up w/ it and I don’t get distracted by planning all sorts of things out, and just coming up w/ one simple checklist, then it should work. Hopefully that made sense lol. And you know, I did try the method you suggested of setting aside a certain time to do hw/study. Idk if I said this in my post or previous reply, it’s been a couple of days since I’ve seen both, but, when I make a list of things that need to get done and that are priorities eps when it comes to school/college, I make the lists long, and detailed and then I end up getting things complicated which in the end makes me confused and not to mention the fact that I spend hours creating these detailed lists so therefore I never get anything done because I’m spending my time doing that. And you know I really don’t think I mean to procrastinate like this,cause my therapist said that’s a form of procrastination and I do believe that it is, but I don’t think I do this on purpose. I feel like I’m almost trying to cover myself up from getting stressed out on my work. This would happen in grade school constantly and this was extremely bad my senior year of hs. And it’s gotten much worse eps during my fall semester. And this summer I’m only taking one class, and I thought it was a class that I was going to be interested but I read the class wrong and I thought it was something else so now I’m less interested in it, but at the same time still slightly interested cause it is an art class and I love art, so anyways, w/ me being less interested it’s getting harder and harder to focus on doing and completing my work and because I was deciding back and forth whether I wanted to continue w/ this class or not, I got behind on my projects I was supposed to be completing and turning in. And these are pretty simple projects to and like I said considering the fact that it is an art class and I love art, it shouldn’t be too much of a struggle. But I still manage to somehow continue the same process over and over again w/ everything I do and it’s beginning to be frustrating, not only that but very tiresome, tedious, and annoying.

1,"I just got out of a relationship that I wasn’t ready for because of my triggers with BPD. I went through therapy, medication, the whole nine. I’ve learned a lot from my experience, mostly that a good relationship will require someone with a lot of understanding and patience, and a lot of work by you on your end to continue to grow through this disorder.  Otherwise, you’ll crash and burn and leave the experience with a tainted perspective and possibly guilt by actions that have taken place during it. 

I’d highly recommend talking to a therapist. Weekly, monthly, whatever you can afford. Or talk to someone who genuinely enjoys listening to others and solving problems (that’s the only word I could think of) with you. 

Also, read some books/articles on both BPD and philosophy. The more you understand what you’re dealing with, the easier it is to deconstruct triggers before they happen. 

I read Seneca “De Ire” it helped me a lot with understanding how terrible anger can be. But take it with a grain of salt, as it’s stoicism. 

If you think you can make things work, then by all means try. But from my experience, I should’ve slowed down and spent more time working on myself because I lost a good friend out of the whole thing. Just consider that while you try to control your emotions.",,fqmnwq
0,"I understand. I had to deal with my family minimizing my mental health most of my life. 

You are suffering, and only having a diagnosis without professional help is not helping any. Your family cannot begin to understand what you are going through, and BPD actions are often seen as attention seeking or manipulative. What they can't see is what you're dealing with, and that your reactions aren't what you mean to put out. 

For now, the damage is done. You've apologized and tried to make it right - it sounds like they just don't understand. And to be fair? We suffer from a kind of insanity at times and it's difficult to interpret if you don't know much about BPD.

Give this a few days. And work on finding resources to help not just you but them too. It took years for my family to come around - and they were the source of my trauma. Trying to get my mother to understand and respect boundaries was an uphill battle. I would advise trying to find some books - a DBT skills workbook is a great place. There's also some great books to read, I would start with is ""Sometimes I Act Crazy: Living with Borderline Personality Disorder"" by Hal Straus and Jerold Jay Kreisman. Stay far away from BPD books that paint us in a negative light, like ""Walking on Eggshells"". Read the user reviews before purchasing.

0,I think what this has to do with BPD is that I am convinced I have to control my moods into order to accomplish tasks. People say you have to do things even if you don't feel like it but that feels really impossible. My ex said she could not fathom the way I thought about things and that you really just have to force yourself to do shit until you feel better. Instead of trying to feel better to do things. To me that sounds like a fast track to a total meltdown or anger explosion. I just wish my moods had less control over everything in my life.,oisin_berry,um6ynj

You deserve better. You will find inner peace, and you will find people who fill the role you so desperately need and deserve.

2,"I can really relate as I have been in a relationship with someone like your mom and even been like your mom or parroted those beliefs of you should be able to do things because I can. It is a highly narcissistic way of thinking. It isn't correct and the person saying that lacks empathy or can't deal with THEIR emotions. Please understand that. You are not incorrect.

In my case the person who was telling me these things I kept trying to explain to her that the more she pushed the further locked in my mental crisis prison I would get. It was horrible. I empathize so much with your pain and anger and self hatred. I tried and tried to change myself that way and its exhausting and soul crushing. 

From your post it sounds like your mom is very mentally damaging for you to be around. Is there a reason you are stuck being around her? Is there any way you can get out or away from her influence? You clearly have a lot of pain to process and this is only  making it worse. She probably will not listen to you. 


In my case the only thing that soothed that intense self loathing was that, miracle of miracles, the person who was pushing and gaslighting me ended up validating the harm they did to me apologizing and reaffirming that I did not deserve it (up to that point they insisted I deserved it). I have been locked in cycles with her for a long time. And the way out was that I swallowed my pride and apologized and took responsibility for the damage I had done her, and listened to her even though I didn't agree with her perspective, and she actually opened up about how much my behavior hurt her or just the pain she was feeling, and then I was able to follow that up by sharing the same, how much her behavior had impacted me. We still have to separate to heal and protect ourselves but I have never felt ANYTHING like that moment of validation. It showed me how powerfully mind destroying gaslighting is to someone with a vulnerable mind. I began to imagine what it would be like to be around people who did not gaslight me at all, even if I was simply alone. I imagined how different life might feel. 

It inspired me to decide with a heavy heart I have to cut off contact further with my parents if they keep gaslighting me and leave a job that is confusing where I have bad boundaries.
 I have thought I can tolerate it and explain or just put my feelings aside. But there will come a breakthrough point when you realize how much your peace matters and that nothing in the world is worth mental chaos because it will destroy your soul and everyone around you will be affected. 

All that is to say I hope you can find a way to unentangle from your mom even if you still care or love her. Don't be surprised if things begin to feel a lot different. The stuff you are saying here is very heavy and dangerous. That amount of shame and self blame will eat you alive. It isn't that you have BPD and are bad as much as your BPD may be allowing you to emotionally stay in a destructive situation.

i’m just gonna try to cut back on speaking about any of my issues to her until we’re in the presence of a mediator like a therapist because i don’t see the value in communicating with her anymore. everything i say to her is “manipulation.” i’m going to focus on staying productive and healthy as much as i can. thanks again!",ImpossibleBicycle249,ul6h66
4,"Oh no this is very clear now that you shared this information. It sounds like you are in a mind trap where she is able to exploit your guilt and shame to make you useful for herself as she probably can't face her own inability to care for herself.  

I also struggle with oversharing my issues with unfit people, an early childhood pattern. That you can recognize it is a great step. Maybe you can find another outlet or somewhere to receive validation as it seems you are experiencing a strong amount of manipulation and gaslighting yourself from her and she is projecting. If you are paying her bills and she is threatening to kill herself if you leave that is an abusive domestic situation and you may need more serious help to extract yourself don't take it lightly. There are domestic violence shelters and places that could help you begin the process when and if you are ready. 

You got this and deserve to experience a more free life no matter what you have done! Sometimes we can't help people we love except by helping ourselves.
