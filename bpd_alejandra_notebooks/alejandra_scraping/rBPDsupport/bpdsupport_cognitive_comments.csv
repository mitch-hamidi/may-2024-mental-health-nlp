You can't now because your habits are set, you need to understand that what you do now is reinforced in some way and your emotional responses are too strong to overcome in a reasonable way - if it was easy you'd have changed by now.

Sorry to sound down, but honestly the sooner you reach out for help the sooner you can manage your emotions better.

BPD is real, but hiding behind or blaming BPD for your actions is not productive.",demunted,byq47h
1,"I didn't get better at finding non-destructive coping mechanisms until I did quite a bit of therapy, DBT work, and EMDR. That's not at all to be discouraging, you can make progress with DBT (IMHO) with workbooks from Amazon, etc if you're not yet in a position to go to therapy. My coping / distracting tools today can be as simple as listening to a playlist I made on Spotify of really loud music, to meditation, or even just sitting and breathing a bit. But none of that stuff worked great until I had done some work with DBT and EMDR.",BPD_BHM,byq47h
0,"Reading this, felt like someone took a peak inside my brain. Can relate to the struggles and fears of wanting to date another woman and being bi. Having 1 personality disorder is difficult to manage as it is, so a combination must be challenging & bpd and autism is another combo to deal with, life can be very unfair. It's not selfish to want love, it's a normal human emotion. If you would like someone to chat with, I'll listenüòä.",Taurus420Spirit,1ad08fd
1,Honestly I agree I‚Äôm pansexual now and I haven‚Äôt been able to really date a women since figuring out my diagnoses. I do feel so much more attraction and just like I‚Äôd be able to really love a women but just like you said that connection feels way too intense. I can say learning more about what you have does send you into a rabbit hole I don‚Äôt think anyone deserves to go down we‚Äôre all worthy of love and I know it feels hard like you won‚Äôt connect or like you are so manipulative or selfish when indeed you just require more than others. We require people that actually desire us not who we let our brain think is the one. I‚Äôm not sure if I needed to actually feel the heartbreak I‚Äôm feeling to snap out of it and realize that I am sometimes the cause of my failed relationships or more so the BPD talks are the reasons I let that consume me on top of not loving myself I see that it leads me to seek validation from others that aren‚Äôt even on my level. Either way love yourself &/ or your family just put some faith into people or things that can‚Äôt just dispose of you when it gets hard. I‚Äôm someone you can talk to if you‚Äôre still feeling distressed ü´∂üèæ,Responsible_Plate207,1ad08fd
2,"Reading your post as sad and horrible as it is, is comforting to know that I don't feel alone with these similar thoughts. It does feel like we are cursed most of the time. Hate it so much",emeralddiamond,1ad08fd
0,I think what this has to do with BPD is that I am convinced I have to control my moods into order to accomplish tasks. People say you have to do things even if you don't feel like it but that feels really impossible. My ex said she could not fathom the way I thought about things and that you really just have to force yourself to do shit until you feel better. Instead of trying to feel better to do things. To me that sounds like a fast track to a total meltdown or anger explosion. I just wish my moods had less control over everything in my life.,oisin_berry,um6ynj
