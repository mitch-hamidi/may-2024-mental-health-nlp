These files are an attempt to make a complete list of keywords that will be helpful to find relevant posts

I put them in three classes: general, therapy and medication.

General keywords are commonly used words associated to treatment, but many of the mentions will be spurious, since a lot of posts discuss recreational drug use or therapy in passing.

For the medication, I added any drug which seemed at all relevant (such as any drug in the open thread about treatments). I also added as many versions and brand names of these drugs as possible, except for a few which were synonyms for common English words. Finally, I added what type of drug these are, in case this becomes relevant later. My thought is that any post containing these terms is very likely to be relevant.

I did not add 'xan' or 'cannabis', given that they tended to refer to recreational use. However, I did add 'medical marijuana' and 'medical cannabis'.

We should find a way to allow for slight mispellings of common medications, but I will not address that for now.
