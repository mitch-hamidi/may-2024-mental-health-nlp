These files are an attempt to make a complete list of keywords that will be helpful to find relevant posts.

I put them in three classes: general, therapy and medication.

General keywords are commonly used words associated to treatment, but many of the mentions will be spurious, since a lot of posts discuss recreational drug use or therapy in passing without discussing the poster's experience with it.

For the medication, I added any drug which seemed at all relevant (such as any drug in the open thread about treatments), since posts mentioning a medication tended to be relevant to the research question. I also added as many versions and brand names of these drugs as possible, except for a few which were synonyms for common English words.

Therapy keywords were provided from the list relating to therapy techniques.


Notes:
1. I did not add 'xan' or 'cannabis' to the medication list, given that they tended to refer to recreational use. However, I did add 'medical marijuana' and 'medical cannabis'.
