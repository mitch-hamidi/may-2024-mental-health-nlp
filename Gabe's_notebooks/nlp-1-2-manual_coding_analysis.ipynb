This is defaulted to 1, and is 0 if the post is about someone else.\n","The column 'is_relevant' takes an inclusive view, so includes any post which discusses therapy or medication in any way. This is defaulted to zero, and is set to 1 if the post is relevant. The majority of these mentions are only done in passing, so I created a new column called 'highly_relevant', which only includes posts which mention a specific type of therapy/medication and some type of outcome. This is defaulted to null, and set to 1 if the post is highly relevant.\n","\n","From reading through 500 of these posts, here are some common patterns:\n","1. There are relatively few posts which go into detail about treatments. I suspect the 'is_relevant' column will not be particularly useful, but the 'highly_relevant' one might be better.\n","2. There may be other research questions which this data set is better suited to address, since there are a lot of commonalities between the posts.\n","3. A number of posts mention that other posts are getting removed or deleted. Since I have already removed those from the data (and wouldn't be able to analyze them anyway), we are getting a filtered sample."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-26T08:39:27.409377Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-26T08:39:27.408634Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-26T08:39:27.416488Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-26T08:39:27.414900Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-26T08:39:27.409342Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["(1882, 9)\n"]}],"source":["print(df1.shape)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-26T08:39:27.420328Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-26T08:39:27.418983Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-26T08:39:27.773778Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-26T08:39:27.772224Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-26T08:39:27.420274Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 1882 entries, 0 to 1881\n","Data columns (total 9 columns):\n"," #   Column           Non-Null Count  Dtype \n","---  ------           --------------  ----- \n"," 0   title            1882 non-null   object\n"," 1   selftext         1882 non-null   object\n"," 2   created_utc      1882 non-null   int64 \n"," 3   over_18          1882 non-null   bool  \n"," 4   subreddit        1882 non-null   object\n"," 5   date_created     1882 non-null   object\n"," 6   self             1882 non-null   int64 \n"," 7   is_relevant      1882 non-null   int64 \n"," 8   highly_relevant  20 non-null     object\n","dtypes: bool(1), int64(3), object(5)\n","memory usage: 119.6+ KB\n"]}],"source":["df1.info()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["90"]},"execution_count":11,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["## Counting the relevant posts\n","\n","df1[df1['is_relevant'] != 0]['is_relevant'].count()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Of the first 500 posts in this sample, there are 90 relevant posts and 19 highly relevant posts (the last non-null entry is a marker for the last post which was coded)."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":2671334,"sourceId":4579285,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"},{"datasetId":4828752,"sourceId":8161593,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30698,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
