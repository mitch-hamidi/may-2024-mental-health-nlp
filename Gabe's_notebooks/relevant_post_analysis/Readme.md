This folder applies the relevant analysis to get a collection of posts which are labelled relevant by the final keyword/decision-tree model.

Since the final plan is to use the scraped data, the data used in this section will likely be irrelevant. However, the sentiment analysis and consensus models need data, so this is useful for generating some data for them to work with.
