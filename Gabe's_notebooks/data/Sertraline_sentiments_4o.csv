"Informal survey: What (legal) drugs, if any, 'worked' for you?","hi! so i'm officially diagnosed, tried dbt but didn't follow through , currently in therapy twice a week (logotherapy) with okay-ish results.

i've been advised that since my bpd is fairly extreme (2 suicide attempts, self-harm, impulsive behaviour that's been costly and devastating for both home and work life), that i need to go under some type of medication. i do not present signs of schizophrenia/schizotypal behaviour however.

i have an appointment coming up, but being no strangers to meds already, i wanted to ask you what, if anything, **worked for you.**

my understanding is that there are several types of drugs, sometime used in isolation and sometimes in tandem with others, roughly falling into the following categories:

**mood stabilizers:** antiepileptics, topiramate (topamax), lamotrigine (lamictal), divalproate (depakote), lithium (to a certain extent as it's not a mood stabilizer per say), etc

**ssris:** citalopram (cipramil), dapoxetine (priligy), escitalopram (cipralex), fluoxetine (prozac or oxactin), fluvoxamine (faverin), paroxetine (seroxat), sertraline (lustral), vortioxetine (brintellix), etc

**maois:** isocarboxazid (marplan), phenelzine (nardil), selegiline (emsam), tranylcypromine (parnate)

**tricyclic antidepressants** amitriptyline (elavil, amitril, endep) , nortriptyline (pamelor, aventyl) , etc (note: these are rumored to make things worst for bpd patients)

**antianxiety agents and sedatives:** benzodiazepines of all kinds: diazipam (valium), alprazolam (xanax), temazepam (restoril), flurazepam (dalmane), and triazolam (halcion). note: these are addictive and prone to abuse in a population already prone to abuse so are rarely prescribed for bpd patients.

**antipsychotics (fgas 'first generation' neuroleptics):** thiothixene (navane), haloperidol (haldol), trifluoperazine (stelazine), flupenthixol (depixol), etc.

**atypical antipsychotics (sgas - 'second generation'):** olanzapine (zyprexa), aripiprazole (abilify), risperidone (risperdal), quetiapine (seroquel), lurasidone (latuda) , clozapine (clozaril), etc.

**opiates antagonists:** naloxone, naltrexone, nalmefene, etc (note: these are experimental in some countries)

**others:** rtms, ketamine injections, psilocybin micro-dosage, etc.

**non-medication but electronically/mechanically assisted therapy:** emdr, etc.

any recommendation would be extremely appreciated as i'm at the end of my proverbial tether. thank you so much!",1602953594,False,BPD,2020-10-17 16:53:14,"Informal survey: What (legal) drugs, if any, 'worked' for you? hi! so i'm officially diagnosed, tried dbt but didn't follow through , currently in therapy twice a week (logotherapy) with okay-ish results.

How did antidepressants modify your behavior and cognition?,"hello, i'd like to know :

1) if you've been on antidepressants, what kind  
2) how did it modify your behavior and cognition (thoughts, side-effects, how you act, react, etc.)

my official diagnosis is adhd and bulimia (18 years of eating disorders). one social worker made me realize i'm dealing with c-ptsd. over the last ten years, i have been diagnosed with social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, dysthymia, bpd with narcissist tendencies, borderline structure, anxious-depressive tendencies, depression, anxiety, ocd, etc. (long list of diagnosis which seems to change)

the diagnosis of bpd happened after a suicide attempt while on antidepressants back then. i noticed i act ""crazy"" on them : the anger is terrible and the mood swings are intense, the suicidal thoughts are escalating, i act on impulses and i take risky decisions. one minute, i'm laughing, the other i'm crying, then i'm angry, without any external triggers... (antidepressants tested : zoloft, effexor, escitalopram, trintellix)

anti-psychotics makes me go yolo and i spend a lot of money while being super zen about it (anti-psychotics tested : seroquel, abilify, rexulti. 

without antidepressants, i am neutral -- not happy, not sad, just fine. everything is much easier, i tend to reflect before i act, but i only turn crazy when my c-ptsd is triggered (loss of energy, hopelessness, guiltiness, reliving memories, depressive state, etc.). i got back on antidepressants because of a recent rape. 

vyvanse is the only thing making me productive due to my adhd (which is believed to be a symptom of bpd for my previous therapist, but officially diagnosed nevertheless by a psychiatrist), but right now the trintellix is overriding it and i'm totally out of focus, out of control, moody, puking everyday (bulimia in remission for a long while and coming back strongly for 3 weeks straight) and putting on weight even so, skin is so itchy, hurtful and watery eyes, headaches, etc.  

i feel like i'm turning crazy, i can't control my thoughts and my apartment is a mess, and i can't find the energy/focus/control to do something about it. i'm going outside for a walk, i'm happy, i come back inside, my mood crashed and i'm crying, and i don't get it. i called my pharmacist, they're going to check with my doctor, but i want to know if it's something normal with bpd or if meds trigger in me some kind of ""bpd-like"" symptoms. i've been trying for so long to remove the diagnosis, and now i realize i do act like i am borderline on the meds...

thanks!

tldr; i think my antidepressants make me act out of character and i do believe i got the diagnosis of bpd due to it. i wonder how bpd patients actually act on antidepressants because i can't find information online, and i wonder why it triggers on me that kind of reaction. i'm normally very calm, neutral and collected.",1580496436,False,BPD,2020-01-31 18:47:16,"How did antidepressants modify your behavior and cognition? hello, i'd like to know :

Medication,"i've never posted in this sub before, but i love to read it and everyone sharing their stories in such a safe and comforting place really helps me feel less alone. what medications are you guys taking or have taken?

so some background: i'm a male, 23, currently a student. i was diagnosed 5 years ago with bdp when i turned 18 (at my university's mental health center). i have also been diagnosed with mdd (when i was 14) that was eventually changed to bipolar ii, sa, gad, and performance anxiety.

since then, i have been on many, many medications and was hospitalized a few months ago. i'm just curious what medicines everyone has been on and what's helped and what hasn't. 

here's a list of mine in order of taking them:

* **zoloft** 100mg: did nothing
* **prozac** 80 mg: too activating, made my hands tremble
* **propranolol** 10 mg: did nothing
* **ativan** 2mgx4: helped with anxiety but lowered my inhibitions and i did some crazy things on it, would also make me very emotional/depressed
* **trazodone** 200mg: really great for sleep, but didn't notice any anti-depressant effects
* **dexedrine** 5mg: almost instantaneous effects, really great for concentration, raised my mood, but sent me into a extreme rage/panic attack, felt completely out of control, effects last days after taking, felt really down afterwards, left me feeling stuck in my head with racing thoughts, felt like i would never be the same again
* **remeron** 15mg: knocked me out and i gained weight! didn't noticed enough effects to continue taking it
* **wellbutrin** 300mg: really increased my sexual drive (which is rare for me), increased my ambition, made me more outgoing, was very activating, increased racing thoughts, increased anxiety, helped with depression, made my hands tremble
* **lexapro** 20mg: gave me the worst headaches when i started, did nothing for bpd but somewhat helped the depression and anxiety
* **risperdal** 3mg: the worst medication i've ever taken, terrible memory problems, fogginess, general uneasiness
* **klonopin** 1mgx3: similar to ativan
* **seroquel** 300mg: worked great at first for my anger and rage, helped with anxiety, both social and general, but eventually i just felt numb and i gained about 10 lbs in two months, also developed a lump under my chest and started getting strange shakes. i know this is generally considered the gold standard for treating symptoms of bpd and i can understand the reasoning. i wish i didn't experience such negative side effects because it was a good drug for me.
* **paxil** 40mg: (currently still taking) is helping with depression, anxiety, anger, and suicidal thoughts. i feel more balanced and in control. i did notice an increase in appetite though, so my doctor added topamax. i do not find paxil activating.
* **gabapentin** 300mgx3: (currently still taking) helps a lot with anxiety, provides a general feeling of calmness and that everything will be okay, but does not feel like a benzo (no spaciness, no drugged out feeling)
* **topamax** 100mg: (currently still taking) not my favorite but i just started. my pdoc prescribed it to add a mood stabilizer to my regimen plus it has the positive side effect of weight loss [i have noticed significant weight loss within the last week (5 lbs)]. it leaves me feeling really foggy, with bad headaches, and slight memory loss; but i hope those side effect subside over time. 

my symptoms certainly are not gone, but i'm still in weekly therapy and i see my psychiatrist once a month as we figure out what medications could possibly help. everyday has been a challenge, but i'm in a much better place than i was a when i entered the hospital a few months ago.

New doctor wants me to go off antidepressants even though I've been taking them since October. What do you think?,"**tl;dr** i am not seeking medical advice. a doctor wants me to stop a medicine that i've been taking for months after only an hour of seeing me. is this common? is this strange? i might get comments telling me to find a new psychiatrist if i'm uncomfortable, but i want to know opinions of others in order to have a better understanding so that perhaps i might not be uncomfortable anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

i am currently in country x. i am moving to country y to work there.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**diagnosis and medicine:**

&amp;nbsp;

i have adhd and possibly bpd (borderline)*. i have taken concerta in august of 2015, brintellix in september of 2015, zoloft from october of 2015 to december of 2015 and then ritalin and brintellix from january of 2016 to july of 2016.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**first psychiatric consultation in country y:**

&amp;nbsp;

- **in may of 2016, i had my first doctor's appointment in country y.** i didn't have time to prepare for the consultation and was mostly worried about whether or not i would be prescribed ritalin. after an hour of talking to me, the new doctor said she would prescribe me ritalin but not brintellix.

- it's a long story, but the short version is that i was **not prepared for the consultation, and the new doctor was the one driving the conversation** (mostly because i was not prepared).

- my soon to be new doctor (starting august of 2016) said she **""suggested"" i taper brintellix** and to discuss the possibility with my soon to be former doctor. she said she would be happy if i followed her ""instruction"" (i thought it was a suggestion), but ""totally respects"" my current doctor (**but how is it respect if you don't give the current health care plan a try?**).

- i returned to country x and explained the situation to my current doctor who is still in residency. we are currently discussing how he can address my concerns as he is unsure for the practices of transferring medical documents in various countries.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**anyway so my question is:**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **what do you think about a doctor who wants me to stop taking antidepressants even though i've been taking them since september?**

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**further explanation of the question:**

&amp;nbsp;

i was prescribed:

- brintellix by a doctor (a psychiatrist) in country x in september of 2015

- zoloft by another doctor (a gp) in country y in october of 2015,

- zoloft and then brintellix by another doctor (a psychiatrist) in country x in october of 2015 and january of 2016 and finally

- brintellix by my current doctor (resident psychiatrist) in country x from january until july of 2016.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**but then all of a sudden despite all those doctors and prescriptions and two medications in two countries, she meets me for one hour and wants me to taper my brintellix?**

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**shouldn't she maybe continue the brintellix and then see if her hypothesis of me doing better without them is correct?**

&amp;nbsp;

i mean **innocent until proven guilty**: i think it's more harmful to take me off the brintellix if it's actually good for me than to continue the brintellix if it's actually bad for me considering i've already been taking brintellix for 4-5 months by the time i was talking to her and antidepressants for 9 months by the time i was talking to her.

&amp;nbsp;

actually after she ""suggested"" (yeah, if it's a suggestion, why didn't you prescribe me? isn't she actually imposing rather than suggesting?),

i told her i was diagnosed with bpd. **she laughed.** she was saying something like i bring up too many labels or use too many professional words and that i should talk more about my feelings instead of bringing up a lot of labels (which was pretty good advice). i don't think her english is very good either. i do not speak the languages in countries x or y, but the people in country x are pretty good in english. (so this rules out either country being the us, uk or canada, but any advice when it comes to those countries may helpful because i might have somewhere to look).

What do you think? **tl;dr** i am not seeking medical advice. a doctor wants me to stop a medicine that i've been taking for months after only an hour of seeing me. is this common? is this strange? i might get comments telling me to find a new psychiatrist if i'm uncomfortable, but i want to know opinions of others in order to have a better understanding so that perhaps i might not be uncomfortable anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

i am currently in country x. i am moving to country y to work there.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**diagnosis and medicine:**

&amp;nbsp;

i have adhd and possibly bpd (borderline)*. i have taken concerta in august of 2015, brintellix in september of 2015, zoloft from october of 2015 to december of 2015 and then ritalin and brintellix from january of 2016 to july of 2016.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**first psychiatric consultation in country y:**

&amp;nbsp;

- **in may of 2016, i had my first doctor's appointment in country y.** i didn't have time to prepare for the consultation and was mostly worried about whether or not i would be prescribed ritalin. after an hour of talking to me, the new doctor said she would prescribe me ritalin but not brintellix.

- it's a long story, but the short version is that i was **not prepared for the consultation, and the new doctor was the one driving the conversation** (mostly because i was not prepared).

- my soon to be new doctor (starting august of 2016) said she **""suggested"" i taper brintellix** and to discuss the possibility with my soon to be former doctor. she said she would be happy if i followed her ""instruction"" (i thought it was a suggestion), but ""totally respects"" my current doctor (**but how is it respect if you don't give the current health care plan a try?**).

- i returned to country x and explained the situation to my current doctor who is still in residency. we are currently discussing how he can address my concerns as he is unsure for the practices of transferring medical documents in various countries.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**anyway so my question is:**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **what do you think about a doctor who wants me to stop taking antidepressants even though i've been taking them since september?**

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**further explanation of the question:**

&amp;nbsp;

i was prescribed:

- brintellix by a doctor (a psychiatrist) in country x in september of 2015

- zoloft by another doctor (a gp) in country y in october of 2015,

- zoloft and then brintellix by another doctor (a psychiatrist) in country x in october of 2015 and january of 2016 and finally

- brintellix by my current doctor (resident psychiatrist) in country x from january until july of 2016.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**but then all of a sudden despite all those doctors and prescriptions and two medications in two countries, she meets me for one hour and wants me to taper my brintellix?**

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**shouldn't she maybe continue the brintellix and then see if her hypothesis of me doing better without them is correct?**

&amp;nbsp;

i mean **innocent until proven guilty**: i think it's more harmful to take me off the brintellix if it's actually good for me than to continue the brintellix if it's actually bad for me considering i've already been taking brintellix for 4-5 months by the time i was talking to her and antidepressants for 9 months by the time i was talking to her.

Rambling,"i've been on four ssris and a tca. suffice to say, shit doesn't work for me. why serotonin though? why isn't there a dopamine antidepressant? except wellbutrin. the only medication that helped me to get through each day, consistently, with minimal problems is adderall/vyanse. basically any stimulant. but i can't get that anymore because i abused benzos when i was having terrible anxiety.   


i'm just kinda rambling here but, i've been on countless meds; abilify, lexapro, zoloft, celexa, paxil, clomipramine, klonopin, xanax, clonidine, gabapentin, seroquel, perphenazine, adderall, vyvanse, and probably some more im forgetting. only ones that worked were the stimulants and the benzos. but since im labeled an addict i can't get those anymore so fuck me right.   


therapy isn't working so far, i've been isolating more and more, deeper into depression. thinking about getting a job again gives me so much anxiety as i cant work for more than a few months and its been getting worse over the years where id just call in most of the time. last job i could only do once a week. idk how to fix this problem, except for getting prescribed adderall or vyvanse again. 

i need some type of external boost of motivation to get me going. i am 29m and live at home with parents. have no money, all my friends moved away, and i barely even talk to my parents. i hate it here. honestly rehab was better, i was surrounded by people like me and made friends and had a steady routine everyday, but that isnt practical in the real world unfortunately.  


i dont know. i dont cut anymore, its pointless to me. i dont wanna kms bc i know there are things i do enjoy about being alive. but im stuck right now. my day consists of being on my computer, distracting myself from my problems all day. going out in public is exhausting. even talking to my family is exhausting.

Has anyone tried Duloxetine/Cymbalta as an antidepressant with Quetiapine/Seroquel as a mood stabiliser?,"i’ve been on 150mg of quetiapine for a few years now as a mood stabiliser and it’s worked really well for me. back when the psych first prescribed it for me he also wanted me to try duloxetine as an anti depressant but after a lot of research i decided against it, mainly because of how bad the withdrawal can be coming off it. i had recently come off venlafaxine which was absolute hell and didn’t really want to go through that again if the duloxetine didn’t work out for me. 

but recently i’ve been struggling even though i have made improvements &amp; worked a lot on my recovery, it feels like no matter what i do i always end up hitting a wall of depression that i just can’t get past. so i’m considering trying duloxetine and at least i can be prepared for a rough time coming off it if it doesn’t work but i’m also worried about the side effects whilst on it and how it will interact with the quetiapine too. 

has anyone been on both of these meds? what has your experience been (good or bad)? 

are there any other medications that might work well with my quetiapine instead of the duloxetine that i can ask about? the psych who wanted me to try it said it was my last/only option for an antidepressant but i know that’s not true!

Effexor and Trazodone?,"i was diagnosed with bpd about two years ago, and i've been on what seems like every medication. zoloft, prozac, buspar, lamictal, wellbutrin, concerta and the list goes on. i've had absolutely no luck with any of these. ssris make me worse, and mood stabilizers have no noticable effects on me, other than making me sweat uncontrollably. i'm currently taking 20mg adderall xr for adhd that i didn't grow out of. my anxiety has been through the roof the last couple months and it only seems to be getting worse every day, and it's unrelated to the adderall. i can barely function. my psychiatrist today told me she wants me to try effexor, 37.5mg once a day until my body gets used to it. she also wants me to take 50mg of trazodone at night to help me sleep. i've been doing some looking around and all i see are a bunch of negative reviews. so with that being said, has anyone had any positive experiences with effexor and/or trazodone?",1504706910,False,BPD,2017-09-06 14:08:30,"Effexor and Trazodone? i was diagnosed with bpd about two years ago, and i've been on what seems like every medication. zoloft, prozac, buspar, lamictal, wellbutrin, concerta and the list goes on. i've had absolutely no luck with any of these. ssris make me worse, and mood stabilizers have no noticable effects on me, other than making me sweat uncontrollably. i'm currently taking 20mg adderall xr for adhd that i didn't grow out of. my anxiety has been through the roof the last couple months and it only seems to be getting worse every day, and it's unrelated to the adderall. i can barely function. my psychiatrist today told me she wants me to try effexor, 37.5mg once a day until my body gets used to it. she also wants me to take 50mg of trazodone at night to help me sleep. i've been doing some looking around and all i see are a bunch of negative reviews. so with that being said, has anyone had any positive experiences with effexor and/or trazodone?",effexor trazodone diagnosed bpd two year ago ive seems like every medication zoloft prozac buspar lamictal wellbutrin concerta list go ive absolutely luck ssri make worse mood stabilizer noticable effect making sweat uncontrollably im currently taking 20mg adderall xr adhd didnt grow anxiety roof last couple month seems getting worse every day unrelated adderall barely function psychiatrist today told want try effexor 375mg day body get used also want take 50mg trazodone night help sleep ive looking around see bunch negative review said anyone positive experience effexor andor trazodone,0.9999958993980568,"['Amphetamine', 'Bupropion', 'Fluoxetine', 'Lamotrigine', 'Methylphenidate', 'Sertraline', 'Trazodone', 'Venlafaxine']","```json

"I am intolerant to most medications, how do I cope?","i'd like to start off by saying i know medications are not a fix all cure. i have been going to therapy for the past 6 or 7 years, and am working on improving my dbt skills, but it is extremely hard without proper medication. 

i started trying to take medications when i was 16 i think, so about 6 years ago. when i was 16 to 17 i took at least 10 medications. a few i can remember are sertraline, prozac, zoloft and more. i reacted extremely badly to all of them, mostly with extreme chest pain, trouble remembering, extreme nausea, increased anxiety or depression. 

then i found paxil, i was on that for about 5 years and slowly tapered off a few months ago. i came off of it with the support of a doctor, i took all the right steps but it was still hell. i came off paxil because it was making me very sick and giving me lots of brain zaps every day. 

when i was on paxil, for the first 1 to 4 years, my mood was manageable. i would still get intense ups and downs but i could manage. unfortunately, i believe paxil was also giving me hypomanic symptoms, because now that i am off of it i do not have hypomanic episodes. 

since i came off paxil i am so suicidal i can barely function. i have recently tried abilify and lamotrigine. abilify made me more anxious than i have ever been in my life and lamotrigine gave me intense chest pain. so currently i am only taking 300mg of wellbutrin, which i have been on for about 2 or 3 months. wellbutrin makes me mildly sick, but it does help a little so i am unwilling to come off of it right now.

I feel like I’ve tried everything.,"no, seriously. my current psychiatrist believes i have bpd, c-ptsd, anxiety, depression, and my long-term diagnosis of adhd still stands. 
she wants to add an adhd med to my current antidepressant but i feel like the antidepressant isn’t working. 

my previous psychiatrist gave me an unofficial diagnosis of bipolar, and i worked with her for a decade and literally nothing worked. when i moved, i finally got this current doc who actually seems to listen to me. 

i’m currently almost 32, and been fighting mental illness my entire life. 

for depression, negative thoughts, anxiety, etc, i’ve tried:
- zoloft (current, and just stopped taking it)
- lexapro 
- latuda 
- abilify 
- prozac 
- celexa
- wellbutrin
- seroquel 
- effexor 
- risperidone 
- valproic acid (i used this in combination with straterra when i was 14-16, and it worked back then. haven’t taken it since) 

at this point i’m trying to figure out what else there even is. i see my doctor on the 25th and i want to discuss new medications and don’t exactly know where to start. why is nothing working?! sick of hating my life and feeling like garbage :(

Currently weaning off of Effexor slowly (psychiatrist’s rec. and being monitored) but starting to feel off after a week and a half,"i’ve heard the horror stories and how it’s one of the more difficult snri’s to come off of. i’ve been on 300mg for a few years now and have just had it lowered to 225mg. 

i’m still on my lamictal (god send i swear, i was an emotionally awful person and extremely manipulative before it). 

but the depressive moods and anxiety has been slowly creeping back in.

i’m ashamed to say i’ve missed three days of work because the anxiety was so bad i couldn’t face leaving the house without shaking.

the thing is, i like my job. i like my coworkers and i’m good at my work. i have no reason to feel this way about going. 

i’ve hardly left the house and have a hard time leaving my bed. i’ve been sleeping so much.

i don’t know how much of this is from weaning off the meds, but the goal is to eventually switch me to zoloft.

i feel like i’ve tried everything. wellbutrin, celexa, gabapentin, lexapro, xanax as a prn, klonopin as a prn, seroquel and i’m just tired of the constant cocktail of meds that never seem to help.

the effexor and lamictal have been the best combo so far. but i’m really thinking it’s the mood stabilizers are what’s really working.

it took years for them to even realize i had bpd and prescribe me something for it.

i’m also thinking i’ve been showing signs of add too but my psych. thinks it’s just extreme anxiety. (i know it’s definitely not the cause, fiancé feels the same). but because i don’t talk about it often enough in sessions i’m not sure they’re getting the full picture.

i’m just tired and feeling worthless.

my fiancé has been so supportive but i feel like it’s only a matter of time before i push him away too with all the ups and downs. i feel a lot of shame.

anyone in the same boat who can share experiences or what worked for them?

Need help for BPD best friend - meds,"hello everyone, i'm writing to you in order to seek some kind of guidance for my bff who's diagnosed with bpd and lately, she's been doing horrible. i know it's always the matter of the meds kicking in, appropriate meds etc. but she's had about 20 meds already and nothing seems to work. obviously we trust her psychologist as she proved to be very good and trustworthy, but this post is more for me seeking out other people with bpd and your perspective od meds and how to reason with my friend and help her get help. (i struggle with ocd and depression, have no idea about bpd)

temporarily therapy is not available, as she's just lost her job, so yeah.  


here's the list of meds that she's tried for the past... 4 years i believe? i'll be using substances and not names of the drug as we are from europe, names differ everywhere: 

* fluoxetine, 
* escitalopram, 
* sertraline, 
* zopiclone
* duloxetine
* trazodone
* alprazolam
* mirtazapine
* promethazine
* vortioxetine
* moclobemide
* hydroxyzine
* lamotrygine
* zolpidem
* quetiapine
* clomipramine
* fluvoxamine

currently she's on lamotrygine + fluvoxamine and quetiapine for sleep. she said that she felt the best on clomipramine, but the side effects (no poop for weeks, literally) were out of control, even for gastroenterologist.

i just want to hear some feedback, inside from people struggling with the same and obviously every brain is different and i'm not asking it in order to self medicate, but rather gather opinion for psychiatrist to talk it over, maybe figure something that will finally get my friend some peace of mind.

also, i do have my bff's consent to post that info. thank you! wish you all well.",1630534506,False,BPD,2021-09-01 22:15:06,"Need help for BPD best friend - meds hello everyone, i'm writing to you in order to seek some kind of guidance for my bff who's diagnosed with bpd and lately, she's been doing horrible. i know it's always the matter of the meds kicking in, appropriate meds etc. but she's had about 20 meds already and nothing seems to work. obviously we trust her psychologist as she proved to be very good and trustworthy, but this post is more for me seeking out other people with bpd and your perspective od meds and how to reason with my friend and help her get help.

"Medication, genetic testing, brain mapping, and QEEGs. Are you frustrated and fed up? This post is for you.","long time borderline, long time lurker, welcome to my first post. me: female.  in my late 20s, diagnosed in early 20s. 3 hospitalizations, many attempts, and 3 dbt intensive outpatient programs.

i’ve done the therapy. i’ve done dbt, i’ve put every effort into getting better but it life still hasn’t stopped sucking. at this point i’ve done enough dbt that some important skills have fully integrated in my life and that’s great, but it’s not enough.

but medication. they say there is no medication to treat bpd, and i’m afraid they’re right. but it can manage symptoms if you’re on the right stuff. this has been my journey: i start zoloft, i feel great for a few months. then i don’t. we increase the dose. i feel better, until i don’t. increase again, until i’m at the max. we switch meds. i  start pristiq. i become suicidal. i start giving away my possessions, i have a plan, i try to kill myself. hospitalized. i start prozac. i feel great for a few months. then i don’t. we increase the dose. i feel better, until i don’t. you get where this is going. it’s a pattern i’ve experienced on almost every drug i’ve tried. it’s fucking frustrating.

i found a place in my city that has a different approach. i got my cheek swabbed for genetic testing. then i got a list of drugs my body does and does not metabolize correctly. like there are some medications i shouldn’t take because my body will continue to need more and more of the drug as my body becomes accustomed to said drug. hence my problems with prozac and zoloft. pristiq is on my no no list. but with this information my psychiatrist knows what they should or should not prescribe, so we don’t waste both of our times and i don’t crumble into hysterics and psychosis during the process of finding what works for me.

they also mapped my brain. the results were abnormal. i have “spikes” and “beta spindles”. whatever the fuck that means, i don’t fully understand it, but now that we have that information, they were able to prescribe a mood stabilizer that actually calms that unnecessary activity. they also know what drugs aggravate that activity, so we know to avoid them. my psychiatrist says it’s like trying to put together a puzzle.

anyways, i’m not saying that medication is the end all be all. it’s not. i’m still in therapy, i still self harm when shit hits the fan, but hooooly shit, things have improved now that i’m taking what actually works with my body. i am currently taking one antidepressant, one mood stabilizer (also meant for epilepsy, as it calms down the brain) and one antipsychotic. 

basically all i’m trying to say is that bpd is not just a mental illness, it’s physical too. our brains don’t work the same way a normal person does. if you are able, and if this type of help is available, take advantage of it. genetic testing and brain mapping. it helps, i swear to fucking god it does. we are a unique group of people, that requires a unique approach. if you can avoid it, don’t just try whatever meds your psychiatrist throws at you, because it may do more harm than good.

Feeling hopeless and stuck,"i'm 18, currently jobless and broke. i had a job until the end of last month, where i was a caretaker for developmentally disabled kids. then i was hospitalized (for the 4th time) for suicidal idealization. leading up to the hospitalization, i was having a panic attack pretty much every shift i worked and just dreading work due to anxiety in general. 

this anxiety limits every area of my life. i have no friends but god i wish i did. i love to be around people, but then if i go somewhere to meet people (the mall for example, no bars) i'm a wreck. i think everyone is looking at me thinking how ugly i am, how fat i am and how weird i walk. it's like a catch 22 because i long for contact with people but when put near people, i run and hide.

the anxiety has caused me to go through 6 jobs in the past year. only one of them lasted more than 2 months, and two of them didn't even last a whole shift. my social anxiety and self doubt is crippling. i just graduated high school this year, and i was in a vocational/trade school. i'm good at school and i was in a program where i could graduate high school as a licensed practical nurse. i started skipping class because of depression and lack of motivation. when i did go to class, i would frequently go hide and cry in the bathrooms because i felt like my peers didn't like me. i started skipping clinical because i didn't think i was good enough to be a nurse, and thought that i would accidentally seriously hurt someone i was trying to help. even though i had great grades in my class and received nothing but praise from instructors. i cannot believe for myself that i am good.

i even do not drive due to anxiety. i have completed driver's education, in-class and in-car, as well as practicing with my friends when i used to still actually attempt to drive. it terrifies me. being in the car terrifies me but i can push through it, but being the driver of the car is unbearable.

i live at home with my father, who hasn't had a job for 6 years. he doesn't have any form of income, no disability. he is a veteran so the va pays for our housing and we receive food stamps. until i was about 13 he was addicted to pills and alcohol. i deeply resent him for everything he's put me through, as well as all of his negligence. i regret that when i was 15 he bought me my first joint and ever since then i've been smoking daily. when i was 14 and caught with cigarettes, i was not punished, but applauded for my ability to get the cigarettes despite being a minor. i've been smoking a pack a day for 4 years now and i developed asthma. i hate him for not having a job, i hate him for making me a bastard child, for exposing me to addiction, for letting me go without so many things i needed and deserved growing up.

i'm a transgender male who started testosterone when i was 15, i'm pierced and tattooed, and damn i've seen a lot and i have a lot to tell. i know i am very interesting and unique, and i know i am a loving and friendly person. but i can't help feel like i am boring, worthless, unlovable, not worth anyone's time. maybe i am even evil somewhere deep down, and i just don't realize it. 

every day is so sad. i don't want to get out of bed and people don't care about me. i don't have anyone i feel i can reach to and no one reaches out to me. i feel like every second is pain. sometimes weed doesn't even numb it anymore. 

i live in a small apartment in a small town and like i said i don't drive, so if i do get out of the house, most of my day is spent walking my dogs around this lonely town hoping to find someone else also lonely.

i don't have any real goals. nothing really interests me other than music and weed and dogs and streetwear and hairstyles. no career draws me in, and when i try to imagine myself in a life where i am happy, i can't.

i've been in various forms of therapy for 7 years now (dbt included) and i've been on more meds than i can count. wellbutrin, to zoloft and prozac and trazodone, xanax and zyprexa and vistaril, seroquel and abilify. i'm sure there's some i'm not remembering at the moment. i currently take wellbutrin, prozac and trazodone and i go to counseling weekly.

my diagnoses include borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety, ptsd, ocd, substance abuse disorder, gender dysphoria, and insomnia.

 as i mentioned before, i've been hospitalized 4 times, i've been escorted by police to the er for suicidal behavior a few times, and i've been partially hospitalized/day treatment program.

i don't know if i'm venting or looking for advice or someone who can relate but i just wanted to get as many responses as possible and i couldn't stay with all of this brewing in my mind anymore.

How Should I Get on With My Life?,"i'm really tired of continuously getting nowhere even though i do try.  i  had hypersensitivity of the emotions and senses as a kid.  i grew up in an environment that was somewhat unstable and invalidating, but nothing to the extent that a lot of people who are afflicted with bpd experienced; however, i do believe that my emotional hypersensitivity blew it out of proportion and contributed to my issues today.  around the age of 12, i moved a significant distance away from all of my friends and what i knew as how life was supposed to be and moved into a situation that was less than ideal for someone like myself.  being a naive kid, i was somewhat excited to move.  it wasn't long after i had moved away that i figured out that the friends i had, that had said that they were going to remain in contact with me, weren't going to keep their promises.  so i was alone and in a new environment that didn't suit me.  i tried for awhile to build friendships, but that wasn't happening; no relationship got beyond the superficial, and i hate being only superficial, so i broke off the relationship.  it also didn't help that it is my nature to be slow to warm up to someone which resulted in many people to break the relationship off his or herself before even giving me an honest chance.  i slowly became much more introverted than i already was, and more or less stopped bothering to even attempt to make relationships.

my mood since the move has been gradually declining, becoming so low in the recent years that i have actually gone on to attempt multiple times to fulfill all the suicidal thoughts i've had over the years.  the fact that i've failed multiple times at that is so depressing and has made my mood decline at an accelerated rate ever since.  a few stays in the hospital led to a few referrals and whatnot.  i've been through several psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers.  those that can actually diagnose (i.e. not social workers) have come to different diagnoses:

* major depressive disorder
* major depressive disorder with psychotic traits/qualities/symptoms
* bipolar depressive disorder
* borderline personality disorder

seeking to get better, i've tried several therapies:

* traditional psychotherapy
* cognitive behavioral therapy
* dialectical behavioral therapy

and an even larger number of drugs for at least an appreciable amount of time and at various dosages and in various combinations to see if they even worked:

* zoloft
* prozac
* cymbalta
* seroquel
* mirtazapine
* abilify
* latuda
* lithium carbonate
* depakote
* l-methylfolate
* adderall
* nuvigil
* (i'm sure there are more, but it doesn't matter really.)

none of it worked as expected.  most of the drugs did nothing at all for me except make me gain obscene amounts of weight and have nasty side effects, adderall and nuvigil being the exception, but they still didn't do what we had hoped.  but now i can't even get adderall or nuvigil because of the combination of shitty laws, shitty doctors, and shitty insurance.  neither cbt nor dbt did anything for me, presumable because i was already employing the techniques that they taught.  traditional psychotherapy helped minimally, but i no longer have access to the therapist that actually helped and have yet to find a therapist that can pull off what the therapist that helped did, especially with the limitations that my insurance places on such services.
currently, i take no drugs, beyond what samples of nuvigil i can convince my sleep doctor to give me, and i do not receive therapy of any kind.  let me just say that i honestly cannot tell a difference between me with the drugs and therapy and me without the drugs and therapy, nor has anyone in my family said anything to the effect that they can discern a difference.  so i've given up on treating this (or perhaps these) issue(s)--i just want to either do something enjoyable, interesting, and meaningful with my life relatively soon (hell, i'd even settle for any semblance that that's what i'm moving toward) or end it.

for the past 2 years or so i've been having very extreme difficulties in sleep, going from periods of hypersomnia (18+ hours a day) to periods of insomnia (&lt;3 hours a day) lasting for 2 weeks to 3 months and back.  it also appears that my sleep fits into what is known as non-24 hour disorder, but my doctor won't even look into it.  the sleep alone makes it extremely difficult to go back to school and finish my last year for my bachelor's.  i've even looked into the school's disability office to see what can be done and they've told me that they can't do anything for me since it would negatively impact the rest of the class and that they can't even do anything regarding attendance.  i had originally dropped out due to the depression and suicidality issues.  i moved back home after dropping out with the intent of going back once i got everything under control.  then my father died about 9 months ago, so now there's a need for me to take care of my younger brother which, for the sake of remaining somewhat anonymous, is between the ages of 5 and 10.  the death of my father has very noticeably taken its toll on my brother and i believe that leaving the house to get on with my life would negatively affect my brother, which negatively affects me.  also, a few years before my father died, he told me that the reason he and my mother seemed so disinterested with me when i was growing up was that i was too intelligent for them to keep up with me.  this has also really negatively affected me, even though it was something that was hinted at all throughout my childhood.

all of the above is just a brief overview of my situation and what affects me.  i've tried continuously to get going again and work toward things that i want, but all the failures have really discouraged me and the anhedonia from the depression has really left me not wanting a lot of things in life.  the few things that i do want (just one good friend [and not even a sexual partner] is at the top of that short list), various people have told me that my expectations or requirements of someone that would satisfy the role are unrealistic which is utterly depressing.  how should i get on with life?  if you would like or require more details, please ask.  i am happy to give details, so long as they cannot, alone or in tandem with what was already said, be used to identify who i or any one of my family members is.",1400776984,False,BPD,2014-05-22 16:43:04,"How Should I Get on With My Life? i'm really tired of continuously getting nowhere even though i do try.  i  had hypersensitivity of the emotions and senses as a kid.  i grew up in an environment that was somewhat unstable and invalidating, but nothing to the extent that a lot of people who are afflicted with bpd experienced; however, i do believe that my emotional hypersensitivity blew it out of proportion and contributed to my issues today.  around the age of 12, i moved a significant distance away from all of my friends and what i knew as how life was supposed to be and moved into a situation that was less than ideal for someone like myself.  being a naive kid, i was somewhat excited to move.  it wasn't long after i had moved away that i figured out that the friends i had, that had said that they were going to remain in contact with me, weren't going to keep their promises.  so i was alone and in a new environment that didn't suit me.  i tried for awhile to build friendships, but that wasn't happening; no relationship got beyond the superficial, and i hate being only superficial, so i broke off the relationship.  it also didn't help that it is my nature to be slow to warm up to someone which resulted in many people to break the relationship off his or herself before even giving me an honest chance.  i slowly became much more introverted than i already was, and more or less stopped bothering to even attempt to make relationships.

medication recs? (I know everyone is different),"just wanted some opinions and at least get familiar with some of these meds. i was only being treated for anxiety/depression, so i've never tried anything other than an ssri/benzo combo. my old pdoc thought i was bipolar ii and put me on 150mg of lamictal, but all i think it did was decrease my happiness threshold.

i fully tapered off prozac around march and i'm looking for a new med to add to the lamictal (we didn't discuss going off of it completely). i was on ssri's since 7th grade (zoloft, lexapro, prozac) and after going off of prozac at 23, i feel like i just put contacts in for the first time. it has been out of my system and i'm shocked at how much more human i feel. i told my pdoc i never wanted to touch an ssri again, but i went from not crying at all to having these episodic spells, my social anxiety is at an all time high, and i can't stop drinking to ease it. having my sex drive/feelings of intimacy back in particular is an important factor because my past relationships have suffered from it. 

are there any meds that have a better tradeoff -as in they can help my panic disorder without making me a zombie? xanax is a miracle drug for me but after abusing it for a few days during one depressive episode, i'm probably not going to be prescribed a benzo.

Story so far...,"first time posting on r/bpd - so i’ll provide some background as to my story: 


-diagnosed with severe depression in 2016, was put on prozac (fluoxetine). moved onto sertraline and fluoxetine after 6 months.
-  late 2017 to part way through 2018 and i start to attend dbt whilst under adolescent outpatient care. turn 19 so unable to attend anymore and basically left to my own devices with gp appointments for medication review.
- 2018 and self harm becomes worse and life starts to deteriorate; discover alcohol is better at letting me sleep than medication. get put on mirtazapine and taken off fluoxetine. admitted several times to ae for self harm and alcohol poisoning as well as some overdoses.
- 2019 and still on mirtazapine; telling my gp every 3 months that it isn’t working and i’m still using alcohol. overdose again late 2019 and am referred to crisis resolution home treatment team (crht).
- wean me off mirtazapine and replace it with a week of diazepam (5mg). have daily meeting with the councillors in my own home.
- tell then about everything, referred to go and attend an appointment at a hospital with a psychologist. diagnosed with bpd the same day (basically he read all notes from 2016 that my gp had taken onwards as well as when i was in camhs) - told my depression and anxiety was just a symptom which is why medications previously were not effective.
- offered zopiclone in the mean time to help me get to sleep (sort of works) and put on venlafaxine (75mg but now up to 225mg). 
- everything going good, but feeling the side effects of the new meds pretty much instantaneously. referred to dbt adult services: still waiting.
- early 2020, overdose again and self harm to the point were police have to pick me up and take me to hospital. wait 14 hours to see psych evaluation team and kick off on them because i know i’ll just be discharged.
- get discharged.
- receive letter saying that i have been accepted for dbt; but they will get in contact with me. still waiting for help. 


so yeah: had my fair share of meds and evaluations - but venlafaxine is always effecting me in terms of side effects. it never makes me feel stable enough to manage my emotions - but i get this feeling where my brain is basically floating in my head and when i move my head it’s like dissociated but instantly “clicks” back?? 
does anyone know how i can make this stop? 
it gets worse if i reduce the dose gradually. no weight gain though (which i’m so happy about), but still cold towards caregivers and always agitated. 


also, in regards to dbt: i have the letter from them but i not feel confident enough to call them and ask for an update. i just desperately want help to get off this medication and learn how to manage my emotions again with the help of dbt. 


also - does anyone know how dbt at adult services differs from the dbt at adolescent services? i’m still struggling with alcohol, gambling, managing money and self harm in the mean time; are these things i can bring up whilst there? i’ve tried private therapy but i just think they’re in it for the money so it never works for me...

Benzo or alcohol? Got weird advice by my psych,"hello, my first post here. (as long as i remember personally.)

two days ago, i had been to my regular visit to the psychiatrist and i asked, what should i do if i feel nervous to the point of throwing up. if it would be appropriate to take a benzo (neurol in my country) in such case.

she laughed at me (which threw me off) and told me that ""how do you even imagine taking it, everyday?"" *\[i am trying hard to convice myself it was ment well, and it was not a condescending tone, but it hit me in the guts right away. it was the first time after 10+ visits i actually opened up a bit to her. she even complained to my husband, who goes there too (gad), that i do not talk to her about my actual issues, which is true.\]* by that point i was shaking (thinking i must have fucked up and stuff, you know it), but told her that it especially happens when i  have to go to doctors, for i am afraid of them.

the doctor told me, it's okay if i take it once per week (before she recommended up to four times per week??) and that it is much better if i take alcohol instead. i reminded her that because of my other meds, i cannot take alcohol, for it makes me weird and sick faster than usual (one shot is more than enough to make me drunk now). to which she only shrugged and did not further pursue the topic.

what i am confused about is, my family has a long **long** history of substance abuse, including alcohol. both my parents were/are addicted to meth, heroine, subutex, alcohol, and cigarettes. they have been years before my birth.  because of this, it took me years to get out of my fear and disgust over these things, and even now i don't feel really great about them. i myself have abused alcohol later in life to calm myself down (spoiler, only made me feel worse.) doctor knows all of this, yet recommends me to drink alcohol on daily basis?

before, she also told me it is better if i take a benzo instead of self harming (but i did a great progress of distracting myself as much as i can instead, so it happens 80% less these days). she is not my first psychiatrist. i have been told by many people, including doctors, that benzo is highly addictive, so i have been taking it only when necessary (sometimes it is three in one week, two in one day, one in a month, it depends.) last time i was in the hospital after an attempt (overdose on trazodone), the psychiatrist who was supposed to check if it is a one time thing or not (to send me home or to send me who knows where) spent the whole thirty minutes with me rambling about neurol being terrible and how i will be super addicted to it by my fourties (??? i was twenty four) and so on.

aside from trazodone (150) i also take venlafaxine (150) daily. i can feel the trazodone working still, but not so sure about venlafaxine (i am one year on it.) before i was on three different brands of citalopram, sertraline, escitalopram, bupropion - none of them had any positive effect, mostly negative side effects (rage, self-mutilitation, excessive sleepiness, nausea). i felt a bit of a pozitive effect on venlafaxine, but only during the first week after raising the dosage (0-75, 75-150), so no idea if it is even related.

**my question is mostly, should i heed my doctor's recommendation and drink alcohol, or should i just take a benzo and be done with it?** the difference between these two for me is only that after alcohol i feel sick and after benzo i am sleepy beyond saving (making me fall asleep even if i just woke up, unless i grit my teeth and stay awake for at least two hours after. diazepam had similar effect on me, but i got a shot because of gerd check up, not psych related.)  


i hope i disclosed all needed context, and also did not write too much, i apologize for the long wall of text. any advice or comment will be highly appreciated! thank you.

ps: hope i used the flairs right.",1579848607,True,BPD,2020-01-24 06:50:07,"Benzo or alcohol? Got weird advice by my psych hello, my first post here. (as long as i remember personally.)

she laughed at me (which threw me off) and told me that ""how do you even imagine taking it, everyday?"" *\[i am trying hard to convice myself it was ment well, and it was not a condescending tone, but it hit me in the guts right away. it was the first time after 10+ visits i actually opened up a bit to her. she even complained to my husband, who goes there too (gad), that i do not talk to her about my actual issues, which is true.\]* by that point i was shaking (thinking i must have fucked up and stuff, you know it), but told her that it especially happens when i  have to go to doctors, for i am afraid of them.

the doctor told me, it's okay if i take it once per week (before she recommended up to four times per week??) and that it is much better if i take alcohol instead. i reminded her that because of my other meds, i cannot take alcohol, for it makes me weird and sick faster than usual (one shot is more than enough to make me drunk now). to which she only shrugged and did not further pursue the topic.

what i am confused about is, my family has a long **long** history of substance abuse, including alcohol. both my parents were/are addicted to meth, heroine, subutex, alcohol, and cigarettes. they have been years before my birth.  because of this, it took me years to get out of my fear and disgust over these things, and even now i don't feel really great about them. i myself have abused alcohol later in life to calm myself down (spoiler, only made me feel worse.) doctor knows all of this, yet recommends me to drink alcohol on daily basis?

before, she also told me it is better if i take a benzo instead of self harming (but i did a great progress of distracting myself as much as i can instead, so it happens 80% less these days). she is not my first psychiatrist. i have been told by many people, including doctors, that benzo is highly addictive, so i have been taking it only when necessary (sometimes it is three in one week, two in one day, one in a month, it depends.) last time i was in the hospital after an attempt (overdose on trazodone), the psychiatrist who was supposed to check if it is a one time thing or not (to send me home or to send me who knows where) spent the whole thirty minutes with me rambling about neurol being terrible and how i will be super addicted to it by my fourties (??? i was twenty four) and so on.

aside from trazodone (150) i also take venlafaxine (150) daily. i can feel the trazodone working still, but not so sure about venlafaxine (i am one year on it.) before i was on three different brands of citalopram, sertraline, escitalopram, bupropion - none of them had any positive effect, mostly negative side effects (rage, self-mutilitation, excessive sleepiness, nausea). i felt a bit of a pozitive effect on venlafaxine, but only during the first week after raising the dosage (0-75, 75-150), so no idea if it is even related.

**my question is mostly, should i heed my doctor's recommendation and drink alcohol, or should i just take a benzo and be done with it?** the difference between these two for me is only that after alcohol i feel sick and after benzo i am sleepy beyond saving (making me fall asleep even if i just woke up, unless i grit my teeth and stay awake for at least two hours after. diazepam had similar effect on me, but i got a shot because of gerd check up, not psych related.)  


i hope i disclosed all needed context, and also did not write too much, i apologize for the long wall of text. any advice or comment will be highly appreciated! thank you.

Effexor Withdrawals; Inside the Borderline Mind (No. 3),"taking effexor was fine for roughly a week. i was prescribed the medication during my stay at the inpatient hospital and was relatively pleased with the results, at first. but looking back, i think my outlook had become more relaxed due to the fact i was receiving intense treatment, not necessarily via the medication change. this was my second ssri to be prescribed to me, after zoloft. it became apparent that zoloft was no longer working when i was sent to the emergency room with severe suicidal ideation and dissociation. at least the side effects were not nearly as bad as effexor, which weeks after my hospital discharge, entailed excruciating migraines once or twice a day. i called the hospital over a weekend, and the on-call doctor told me to just come off the meds, since i was technically on the lowest dosage. apparently, that was incorrect. according to other doctors i have since consulted, i was supposed to have alternated taking the effexor by the day, slowly weaning myself off of it. what they say is true; effexor, is by far, the worst drug to withdraw from that i have ever taken. save for the fact that i did it cold turkey. its absence gave me a boggling sense of loss, vertigo, and rapid mood swings, followed by a sense of total emptiness. classic case of unmedicated bpd, but with a lot of dizzy spells. subtle migraines, constantly on the verge on nausea, but never actually becoming sick, unable to eat, and unable to stand. i will never take that drug again. for anyone who has gone through either zoloft, effexor, or both, what were you prescribed next? i am hesitant to try even anything else, as the withdrawal forced me to quit my job. i was a full-time student as well, which my hospital stay took from me. although i am not angry at this recovery process, it has stopped time for me. i am not working, not studying; just sitting at home, healing myself. i attend weekly therapy, and have hopes to rejoin a dbt skills group. but for now, i hope i am going in the right direction. any and all suggestions are welcome- i want to get well.",1512334584,False,BPD,2017-12-03 20:56:24,"Effexor Withdrawals; Inside the Borderline Mind (No. 3) taking effexor was fine for roughly a week. i was prescribed the medication during my stay at the inpatient hospital and was relatively pleased with the results, at first. but looking back, i think my outlook had become more relaxed due to the fact i was receiving intense treatment, not necessarily via the medication change. this was my second ssri to be prescribed to me, after zoloft. it became apparent that zoloft was no longer working when i was sent to the emergency room with severe suicidal ideation and dissociation. at least the side effects were not nearly as bad as effexor, which weeks after my hospital discharge, entailed excruciating migraines once or twice a day. i called the hospital over a weekend, and the on-call doctor told me to just come off the meds, since i was technically on the lowest dosage. apparently, that was incorrect. according to other doctors i have since consulted, i was supposed to have alternated taking the effexor by the day, slowly weaning myself off of it. what they say is true; effexor, is by far, the worst drug to withdraw from that i have ever taken. save for the fact that i did it cold turkey. its absence gave me a boggling sense of loss, vertigo, and rapid mood swings, followed by a sense of total emptiness. classic case of unmedicated bpd, but with a lot of dizzy spells. subtle migraines, constantly on the verge on nausea, but never actually becoming sick, unable to eat, and unable to stand. i will never take that drug again. for anyone who has gone through either zoloft, effexor, or both, what were you prescribed next?

BDP and Medication - Does anything actually help?,"hello,

some background - i was diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis in april 2017 and was recently treated with intravenous steroids. the treatment did improve some of my symptoms such as rage, violent outbursts, and intensive crying episodes. my anxiety is also reduced. the feeling that was there before and stayed though is loneliness. i feel extreme emotional pain that is easily triggered by seeing a family have dinner in a restaurant, hearing someone talk about their cousins, a facebook photo of someone with their child. i don't have any of that - no family dinners, no children, no nephews, no cousins in this country. this causes me severe emotional pain. sometimes it can be paralyzing. i could be at work, feeling ok and just doing my job, then i overhear a conversation of two coworkers and someone mentions seeing family on the weekend. i then get an intense feeling, sort of like grief (that is what a psychologist told me whom i used to see). i feel tearful and even physical pain in my chest. i can't continue to work, i can't do anything, i just want to stop exiting because the pain is so strong.

i have already tried tons of medications which did not help at all - abilify, cipralex, mirtazapine, wellbutrin, risperidone, olanzapine, trazadone, cymbalta, pristiq, sertraline, latuda, etc.

i was now prescribed lithium by a psychiatrist but my family doctor is not sure whether i can take it because of my autoimmune disease.

Wtf is wrong with me? * trigger warning for self harm/ eating disorders / drug use*,"sorry to the mods if my tagging isn’t correct format please don’t delete my post i tried, i’m not used to that kinda thing and i didn’t see a format under the rule for tagging, please i’m really in a bad place i need advice please don’t prevent me from getting this out.

i seriously just spent the last 7 hours, 11 pm to 6 am now, reading and rereading and rereading the comments section on a single youtube video i had put on for a quick laugh before sleep. i’m supposed to drive my spouse to work in an hour and a half, then try to make some money myself doing deliveries. 
 
i haven’t had a single stretch of sleep longer than 3 hours in over a week and i’ve all but stopped eating. idk how much longer i can do this rn. i feel like i’m breaking. people think my bpd has been better because i’ve been stable but really i’ve just gotten way better at hiding it. i’ve still been making shitty impulsive decisions just doing it more in secret and i’ve felt emotionally numb and dead inside ever since quarantine began, maybe even a few months before that. i fucking hate it. i literally have such little emotion i’m afraid of myself because i feel like i don’t reliably know right from wrong right now and i can do anything off an impulse. when i do start to feel anything, it comes out of fucking nowhere and is so intense i feel like i’m going to explode and i can’t even fucking tell what emotion i am having! it’s just vague intensity almost like a panic attack but not one. or maybe it is hell idk it doesn’t feel like i’m used to if it is. 

i’m becoming increasingly forgetful all of a sudden, never remembering to lock my car anymore, while also not remembering to grab my wallet instead leaving it right there on the seat in a neighborhood where car break-ins are common. 

felt the urge to cut again a few times recently for the first time in a very long time just so i can feel something. alternately when i’m having that exploding vague emotion feeling i want to cut because it used to calm me and center me during panic attacks but it’s such a fucking horrible non coping mechanism i know logically i don’t want to do it even though the urge keeps getting worse and worse. 

i can’t tell why i’m not eating. a mix of factors i suppose. my stomach has been wrecked with stress i’m having trouble feeling and recognizing though i’m sure it’s there under the surface i assume while i also have been having massive body image issues lately and horrible dysphoria as the pandemic has put me in a situation where we are living with extended family including my dad who i can’t bring myself to come out to even though i’m out to everyone else in my life. not to mention the pain of constantly feeling like i’m starving seems to be making it impossible for my mind to dwell to long on any of the thousands of horrid thoughts in my head. 

 i feel so alone. i feel so, so disconnected from everyone and from reality right now. i keep splitting on everybody. one minute feeling like my spouse is an angel i don’t deserve and the next feeling that she is the cause of everything wrong in my life and ready to divorce her. similar feelings about parents and friends. 

i’m so fucking broke and in debt and can’t afford therapy at the moment. but i’m going to try to shoot my therapist a text today and then try to save up for a session or two after i get a couple more things paid off.

has anyone here ever tried mood stabilizers before? i have heard they can help with bpd but i don’t know anything about them. old therapist that had me diagnosed with anxiety and depression sent me to a psychiatrist that put me on sertraline and klonopin and they fucking ruined my life at the time. i begged the psych to not give me the klonopin script because of my addictive personality and past xanax addiction but she was a bitch to me and gave it to me anyways and i abused it just like i knew i would. 

my currentish therapist who i haven’t seen since lockdown i specifically picked because she was all about trying to help through therapy without meds, and she’s the one who finally diagnosed me properly, but i’m starting to think i really might need to be on something just nothing that can be addictive. i know sertraline is an ssri, is that the same thing as a mood stabilizer ? i hated it, it’s also been horrible for 2 out of 3 of my friends who have been on it. i don’t wanna feel like that again but i want to feel something and i want to be stable. if that is the same as a mood stabilizer maybe i just need to try a different one?

any insight into anyone’s experience with mood stabilizers would be greatly appreciated so i can bring it up to my therapist and see what she thinks and if she knows an actual good psych she can refer me too.  

like i just told my spouse as i vented to her a minute ago, my emotions feel like they’re completely on mute and i feel nothing with random bursts of unknown emotions hitting an 11 out of nowhere. i fucking hate it. i wnna be at a 5. i want to feel something but i don’t want to feel everything so intense either. i just want to feel “normal” i can’t even remember if i’ve ever felt that way. i feel like i’ve been dealing with these issues at least since age 9. i remember next to nothing prior to that age except a few traumatic events and a couple happy memories from my childhood.

in the mean time if anyone has any good coping mechanisms for me for any of the problems i’ve described especially the intense emotions out of nowhere please let me know. i haven’t seen  my therapist since lockdown started. she helped me talk through my traumatic past and figure out a lot of what my issues are and what i was feeling, but the coping mechanisms were somewhat lite as just the talking was such a huge improvement for me and our plan was to talk through all those issues first then start work with dbt but lockdown hit before we got there and life has been so weird and intense ever since i completely neglected my mental health just thinking foolishly that getting things off my chest had fixed me somehow. god i’m so naive sometimes.  

if anyone takes the time to read this and offer any advice i appreciate you more than you could possibly know. ❤️ 

and just so no one is overly worried i don’t think i’m an immediate physical danger to myself, i’m holding it together but the cracks are forming though. but i have successfully resisted cutting so far and i haven’t been suicidal in a very long time, i’ve had 2 massive heart attacks that nearly killed me in recent years so i’m pretty terrified of dying to be honest as much as life exhausts me and even though i used to be suicidal constantly when i was younger. and i’ve never thought about hurting anyone else, even if i am completely enraged at someone else i always just take it out on myself. like i’ll yell at someone (extremely rarely) but if my anger wants to get physical i’ll go find a place to be alone and punch a wall or steering wheel , or sometimes just scream, until i start crying. 
 
sorry for the long ass post y’all. promise i won’t make another anytime soon just needed to get this off my chest to someone who gets it and need some advice. thank you all and i hope you’re all doing well.",1619187501,False,BPD,2021-04-23 14:18:21,"Wtf is wrong with me? * trigger warning for self harm/ eating disorders / drug use* sorry to the mods if my tagging isn’t correct format please don’t delete my post i tried, i’m not used to that kinda thing and i didn’t see a format under the rule for tagging, please i’m really in a bad place i need advice please don’t prevent me from getting this out.

like i just told my spouse as i vented to her a minute ago, my emotions feel like they’re completely on mute and i feel nothing with random bursts of unknown emotions hitting an 11 out of nowhere. i fucking hate it. i wnna be at a 5. i want to feel something but i don’t want to feel everything so intense either. i just want to feel “normal” i can’t even remember if i’ve ever felt that way. i feel like i’ve been dealing with these issues at least since age 9. i remember next to nothing prior to that age except a few traumatic events and a couple happy memories from my childhood.

in the mean time if anyone has any good coping mechanisms for me for any of the problems i’ve described especially the intense emotions out of nowhere please let me know. i haven’t seen  my therapist since lockdown started. she helped me talk through my traumatic past and figure out a lot of what my issues are and what i was feeling, but the coping mechanisms were somewhat lite as just the talking was such a huge improvement for me and our plan was to talk through all those issues first then start work with dbt but lockdown hit before we got there and life has been so weird and intense ever since i completely neglected my mental health just thinking foolishly that getting things off my chest had fixed me somehow. god i’m so naive sometimes.  

if anyone takes the time to read this and offer any advice i appreciate you more than you could possibly know. ❤️ 

and just so no one is overly worried i don’t think i’m an immediate physical danger to myself, i’m holding it together but the cracks are forming though. but i have successfully resisted cutting so far and i haven’t been suicidal in a very long time, i’ve had 2 massive heart attacks that nearly killed me in recent years so i’m pretty terrified of dying to be honest as much as life exhausts me and even though i used to be suicidal constantly when i was younger. and i’ve never thought about hurting anyone else, even if i am completely enraged at someone else i always just take it out on myself. like i’ll yell at someone (extremely rarely) but if my anger wants to get physical i’ll go find a place to be alone and punch a wall or steering wheel , or sometimes just scream, until i start crying. 
 
sorry for the long ass post y’all. promise i won’t make another anytime soon just needed to get this off my chest to someone who gets it and need some advice. thank you all and i hope you’re all doing well.",wtf wrong trigger warning self harm eating disorder drug use sorry mod tagging isn’t correct format please don’t delete post tried i’m used kinda thing didn’t see format rule tagging please i’m really bad place need advice please don’t prevent getting seriously spent last 7 hour 11 pm 6 reading rereading rereading comment section single youtube video put quick laugh sleep i’m supposed drive spouse work hour half try make money delivery haven’t single stretch sleep longer 3 hour week i’ve stopped eating idk much longer rn feel like i’m breaking people think bpd better i’ve stable really i’ve gotten way better hiding i’ve still making shitty impulsive decision secret i’ve felt emotionally numb dead inside ever since quarantine began maybe even month fucking hate literally little emotion i’m afraid feel like don’t reliably know right wrong right anything impulse start feel anything come fucking nowhere intense feel like i’m going explode can’t even fucking tell emotion it’s vague intensity almost like panic attack one maybe hell idk doesn’t feel like i’m used i’m becoming increasingly forgetful sudden never remembering lock car anymore also remembering grab wallet instead leaving right seat neighborhood car breakins common felt urge cut time recently first time long time feel something alternately i’m exploding vague emotion feeling want cut used calm center panic attack it’s fucking horrible non coping mechanism know logically don’t want even though urge keep getting worse worse can’t tell i’m eating mix factor suppose stomach wrecked stress i’m trouble feeling recognizing though i’m sure it’s surface assume also massive body image issue lately horrible dysphoria pandemic put situation living extended family including dad can’t bring come even though i’m everyone else life mention pain constantly feeling like i’m starving seems making impossible mind dwell long thousand horrid thought head feel alone feel disconnected everyone reality right keep splitting everybody one minute feeling like spouse angel don’t deserve next feeling cause everything wrong life ready divorce similar feeling parent friend i’m fucking broke debt can’t afford therapy moment i’m going try shoot therapist text today try save session two get couple thing paid anyone ever tried mood stabilizer heard help bpd don’t know anything old therapist diagnosed anxiety depression sent psychiatrist put sertraline klonopin fucking ruined life time begged psych give klonopin script addictive personality past xanax addiction bitch gave anyways abused like knew would currentish therapist haven’t seen since lockdown specifically picked trying help therapy without med she’s one finally diagnosed properly i’m starting think really might need something nothing addictive know sertraline ssri thing mood stabilizer hated it’s also horrible 2 3 friend don’t wanna feel like want feel something want stable mood stabilizer maybe need try different one insight anyone’s experience mood stabilizer would greatly appreciated bring therapist see think know actual good psych refer like told spouse vented minute ago emotion feel like they’re completely mute feel nothing random burst unknown emotion hitting 11 nowhere fucking hate wnna 5 want feel something don’t want feel everything intense either want feel “normal” can’t even remember i’ve ever felt way feel like i’ve dealing issue least since age 9 remember next nothing prior age except traumatic event couple happy memory childhood mean time anyone good coping mechanism problem i’ve described especially intense emotion nowhere please let know haven’t seen therapist since lockdown started helped talk traumatic past figure lot issue feeling coping mechanism somewhat lite talking huge improvement plan talk issue first start work dbt lockdown hit got life weird intense ever since completely neglected mental health thinking foolishly getting thing chest fixed somehow god i’m naive sometimes anyone take time read offer advice appreciate could possibly know ❤️ one overly worried don’t think i’m immediate physical danger i’m holding together crack forming though successfully resisted cutting far haven’t suicidal long time i’ve 2 massive heart attack nearly killed recent year i’m pretty terrified dying honest much life exhaust even though used suicidal constantly younger i’ve never thought hurting anyone else even completely enraged someone else always take like i’ll yell someone extremely rarely anger want get physical i’ll go find place alone punch wall steering wheel sometimes scream start cry sorry long as post y’all promise won’t make another anytime soon needed get chest someone get need advice thank hope you’re well,0.99968622450508,"['Alprazolam', 'Clonazepam', 'Sertraline']","```json

Nothing to look forward to and lacking a will to live.,"i am 20m, in uk, diagnosed with asd, ocd, and 'eupd traits'. i couldn't get a full review for bpd/eupd, because it wouldn't affect my treatment options. the former two were diagnosed in 2016 which is the same year i was prescribed an antidepressant. i have been on different medications for over 4 years.

initially, in mid-2016, i had fluoxetine. after some months, this was changed to sertraline, and an antipsychotic (risperidone) was added. i stayed on this medication for some years. in mid/late 2019, risperidone was replaced with quetiapine. in early-2020, sertraline was replaced with venlafaxine. as of now, it's impossible for me to confirm if the medication has made, or is making, a positive difference.

since 2016, i have had numerous forms of treatment: talking to psychiatrists, counselling with trained professionals, psychotherapy, cbt therapy (i did this in late-2018/early-2019, but i am currently in a second round of it, with longer sessions), calling helplines, etc.

i have had numerous blood tests, checking vitamin/mineral levels, testosterone, thyroxine, tsh, etc. this shows low thyroxine (free t4) and high tsh. this indicates hypothyroidism, but i need to wait for another blood test in february to confirm the pattern. quetiapine could be causing this thyroid issue which explains my frequent sleeping. interests flick on and off like switches in my brain, and my mood/optimism rapidly changes. this is likely eupd-related, and medication might never fix this.

treatment may have helped me to complete my pre-university education and lead a more-functional lifestyle, but i am far from living a happy life.

i am not currently in-education, but i have applied to university for entry in september/october 2021. ever since the uk lockdown began in march, i have spent some time on my studies (looking over my old work and getting a head start on what is to come) and do research into what i want, career-wise. now, all university admissions commitments (e.g. applications, interviews and tests) are over. 

i'm not looking forward to studying engineering, because i'm terrified of many things, namely boredom and the high workload. i don't know if i'll be alive in september 2021. i feel like university will lead me to a life far away from art, writing, music, or anything of that sort. i cannot see all of these things coming together in any meaningful way. if i miraculously graduate in engineering, how are any of these side projects going to lead me anywhere? i'm being pulled in completely different directions. 

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

since april/may, i started duolingo to study japanese. i only do 15 minutes on my phone, on a near-daily basis. i may start doing more hand-written work and in-depth studying (from my downloaded resources), since i don't have university deadlines looming over me.

over the months, i have tried to get into python and drawing. i did some basic programming practice today, using online resources, but it has been months since i did any art. it's not really art, just the homework exercises from the drawabox website. all of this is very boring, and i feel like i can never get better due to my procrastination. 

i want to be good at art, but i'll never make it the way that i'm going now. when it comes to writing stories, reading or music, just forget about it. it's been months since i touched the novel i wanted to read. i know i have to read if i want to be a good writer, but i cannot do it. i haven't played an instrument in years, despite having access to a keyboard and acoustic guitar. i just can't see a point in starting. it's not fun, and it will take years upon years to feel like i'm getting somewhere. i rarely play games, because i don't feel in the mood to play them.

gyms re-opened in late-july, but i didn't decide to come back until late-september. i did weight training 3 times per week until the second november lockdown forced gyms to close again. when they opened again in december, i went every other day. i managed to work my way back to the same place i was before the november closure. they have been closed for just under a week, due to christmas, but i'll start again tomorrow. 

these setbacks have been really annoying, and i question why i'm even doing this, when i doubt i'll have the time once university starts. i don't want to lose my progress. it's mainly for vanity and maybe some health benefit. i go in the hope that, one day, i'll like the way i look, but this will take many years. it's not fun, and it doesn't always improve how i feel, once i've done a session.

i watched soul on disney+, and the scene came-up about appreciating life for the little things. all i could think is that it sucks for me and everyone else with anhedonia, who cannot feel pleasure from these little things that make life worth living. i though that the existential premise would be for me, but i felt empty the whole way through, never smiling or feeling moved. there are a few things i have watched this year that i like, but it just makes me long for the day when i will be good-enough to create my own media.

i am so tired of everything feeling like a chore and the constant jealousy. there are times where i cannot look at someone's art/animation online without feeling like it's already over for me. the same applies to music. there are numerous people i have reached-out to, some semi-popular, not online celebrities or anything. some do talk occasionally, but the rest either haven't seen my messages or have read them and not responded. i feel even more worthless, knowing that months have passed and i don't matter to any of these people. i feel inadequate in every way to them. there's no reason for me to exist when they do.

when i procrastinate, i go to bed and rest, hoping that my thoughts will go away. i have nobody in my life. i don't love my father, and i told him right to his face. i don't know how i feel towards my mother and siblings, even though they love me. there are some friends, but i don't think they would be any worse-off if i died. many are busy and live far across the country, due to university. i feel a lack of closeness to anyone, but what's painful is that i desire connection more than anything.

i am tired of spending every night in an empty bed. even if i had a partner, they couldn't take away the mental exhaustion and pain i feel. i'll never be happy with myself. i have no self-esteem, and i feel like worthless most of the time. i have many regrets and hold trauma from the past. discussing this in therapy at great-length has not reduced the inner guilt and shame i feel.

there are two reasons i am not already dead:

1) i don't want to die a failure. dying, being forgotten and having served no purpose is my greatest fear. even if i say that what i do doesn't matter, because this universe isn't forever, that just creates its own anxiety. if, no matter what i do, the world will cease to be one day, why bother living if i don't enjoy it? why put myself through all of this work and pain when i get nothing out of it? all the praise and accolades in the world can't give me what i want. i want to feel appreciated, but i cannot see myself ever being content. i don't want fame, but i want to be needed.

2) i have done a lot of research into suicide methods. physical means are not an option, so that leaves overdose or poisoning. overdose on legal substances is notoriously unreliable and results in many failed attempts, potentially with life-altering consequences. poisoning will work, but i can't get it. i don't trust paying for sn online. even if what i order is what i get, it could get seized. i'll lose my money and could face punishment for ordering without a chemical license.

"18yo with ruined sex life – I can't orgasm on my medication BUT the medication helps my BPD a lot, any advice?","hi, fellow borderline 18-yo here. i am having sexual problems and am unable to orgasm. i have read that this might be caused by my medication, zoloft (in my country it has a different name, serlift/sertralin). i was being prescribed xanax 1mg and zoloft 50mg. since it wasn't enough, now my zoloft dose went up to 100mg, 1mg xanax is still there since no addiction and my doctor added olonzapin, an antipsychotic which should help me sleep (had problems from zoloft) and support what zoloft does. i am not psychotic, it is used to treat schizofrenia which i do not have, but my doctor said it would help. i only take a quarter of the pill and it does help. okay, whatever.

&amp;#x200b;

zoloft makes me unable to orgasm during sex which was never a problem a only appeared since the increase from 50mg to 100mg. i get wet but am unable to orgasm which makes my girlfriend sad. it is incredibly hard to orgasm during masturbation but i have made it once after 20 minutes of effort and at least 5 times of ""being-almost-there-but-actually-not"".

&amp;#x200b;

i know i should talk about this to my doctor, but i only see her in 3 weeks. i started taking the zoloft 100mg before 4 days. maybe it's placebo or just the 50mg from earlier kicking in, but i feel a small improvement and don't want to lose it, since i have many, many scars on my arm

zoloft makes me unable to orgasm during sex which was never a problem a only appeared since the increase from 50mg to 100mg. i get wet but am unable to orgasm which makes my girlfriend sad. it is incredibly hard to orgasm during masturbation but i have made it once after 20 minutes of effort and at least 5 times of ""being-almost-there-but-actually-not"".

&amp;#x200b;

i know i should talk about this to my doctor, but i only see her in 3 weeks. i started taking the zoloft 100mg before 4 days. maybe it's placebo or just the 50mg from earlier kicking in, but i feel a small improvement and don't want to lose it, since i have many, many scars on my arm

Conflicting info from vague doctor about starting effexor - any advice would be appreciated,"hi guys, (also posted in effexor sub)

so back in summer 2018 i was prescribed two 37.5mg tablets of effexor twice a day (venaflaxine here in the uk). i was on sertraline which was great but went back to the docs asking for something new due to the libido issues. i took one tablet and the foggy side effects took place and i got sent home from work, so i stopped taking them. i felt like i didn't have the time feel the side effects and for them to subside. luckily i was in a good period so wasn't desperate for the help.

recently i've been feeling pretty bad again so was going to start taking them again but went to the doctor today to get their advice, and i don't really think he was listening to me. he gave me the option of citalopram or the effexor again. i said what do you recommend and he was like ""i'm giving you the choice"" - super confusing as he's a doctor so should be telling me what to do! of course i couldn't do loads more research sitting in the room so i've just stuck with the effexor for now and will get another appointment in a month. however he said take one per day, where the leaflet says the usual starting dose is 2x 37.5mg per day, as does my original prescription.

recently i've not been feeling great (i have bpd so anxiety, depression, mood swings, paranoia) so was going to start taking them again but went to the doctor today to get their advice, and i don't really think he was listening to me. he gave me the option of citalopram or the effexor again. i said what do you recommend and he said ""i'm giving you the choice"" - super confusing as he's a doctor so should be telling me what to do! of course i couldn't do loads more research sitting in the room so i've just stuck with the effexor for now and will get another appointment in a month. **however he said take one per day, where the leaflet says the usual starting dose is 2x 37.5mg per day, as does my original prescription.**

what i'm not sure about is whether i should take 2x per day as originally prescribed or 1x a day as he says. if i take 1x a day will i not just go into withdrawal before i take it the next day? of course usually i would do whatever the doctor says but this doctor wasn't very helpful and i now have two conflicting prescriptions.

Wondering if my depression/anxiety is actually BPD,"so i’ve (25m) struggled with generalized “depression/anxiety” symptoms for a long time and when i first went to see a psychiatrist at 21, i reported feeling symptoms of being anxious and down a lot of the time. that was enough for a cursory anxiety/depression diagnosis and ssri script. initially the script (zoloft) made me feel kind of euphoric, but that euphoria dropped quickly.

since then i have gone through a couple ssris (lexapro, prozac, and now the snri pristiq) with little success. wellbutrin was a bit of a help but i suffered seizures on it (probably due to my ed). 

i’ve never talked to my current psychiatrist about “reconsidering” the diagnosis but i’ve been reading about bpd and some of the symptoms make me think that i might be better suited for a bpd treatment, esp. some kind of mood stabilizer. here’s what i mean:

-i don’t have “spells” of depression. mostly i feel low and i occasionally have some kind of trigger that gives me this sense of hope and energy that seems like it comes from nowhere—but i appreciate it and am able to be active and do stuff all the while knowing nothing has “really” changed.
-i am incredibly susceptible to triggers. a friend reaching out or a job interview could give me euphoria. going a day without social interaction or reaching a seeming dead end in a pursuit of mine launches me into despondency. i can switch to feelings of hopelessness and dread quickly, but all the while i can sense they’re “fake” and have the wherewithal to show evidence to myself that the dread is exaggerated.
-i am very insecure and self-conscious around others and a lot of my triggers involve some kind of slight perceived change in how someone else sees me or is treating me, even if i intellectually know that that’s “not how things work.” texts giveth and they taketh away.

however i’m also aware that there are some symptoms of bpd (anger?) that i don’t really feel. if i do it’s to myself. feelings of worthlessness, etc. 

anyway, i’m not here for a diagnosis. i’m just curious if anyone has a similar experience with reevaluating their unipolar depression diagnosis and has found bpd to be more fitting for them. i’d like to have some thoughts and insights into what i’m feeling before i meet with my psychiatrist again to get a sense of whether it’s worth going down that path with her and getting on some kind of mood stabilizer—or another drug that might help supplement my pristiq.

"Misdiagnosed as bipolar, how long will it take to recover from years of unnecessary anti-psychotics?","i was 17 when they misdiagnosed me as bipolar, and cycled through maybe 20-25 different antidepressants and eventually antipsychotics in the past 6 years. from zoloft to seroquel, i’ve been there.

Anyone know a med similar to quetiapine but without the weight gain?,"hi! some background info i’m currently on sertraline and i am also prescribed quetiapine (a relatively small dose of 25mg in the morning and 50mg at night) however i stopped taking my quetiapine a few months ago after it made me gain around 30 pounds in 5/6 months. as someone with problems with ed’s and serious body image problems i could not cope with that amount of weight gained and in fear of gaining more i stopped taking them.

apart from the weight gain, it was a great med for me and seemed to be working well despite the small dose. i did also use to take an extra 25mg as prn when having a bpd episode which calmed me down. it was a life saver really in that aspect but unfortunately the weight gain over-rid the good. been off it for about two months now so have got through the awful withdrawal stage.

so now i am just on sertraline and my mood swings and episodes are becoming very frequent again. i’m an emotional wreck and i can’t get anything done. i have no motivation and basically just spend my days in bed falling behind on all my uni work. i hate this.

i have a medication review coming up next week where i’m going to tell them i’ve come of quetiapine but i really feel like i need to be put on an alternative because as i am right now i don’t think an anti depressant is enough and i feel like i definitely need an anti psychotic or mood stabiliser to go along side it. does anyone know of a med similar to quetiapine just without the weight gain? i’m sure my psychiatrist will have some options but would just like to get a perspective and advice from people with bpd who have experienced the med themselves.

"Can BPD be ""brought out"" of an individual by medication?","i'm not sure if this is the correct place to put it, but i thought- why not post it.

can someone show signs of bpd through incorrect treatment? specifically, medication. 


my story is somewhat interesting, i suppose, and i would like to share it with you. 

&gt;i went through an extremely traumatic experience about 2 years ago. i went into the hospital for psychiatric help, in which they automatically prescribed me ativan and zoloft. i went in for a few more therapy sessions after these were prescribed, but the sessions stopped after about a month.

&gt;fast forward to a year later, the ativan was the only thing i felt was working for me. i had just started a stressful job and was in an abusive relationship. my doctors changed my zoloft to prozac, and a few months later, i went into the er due to nonstop panic attacks. 

&gt;i went back into therapy, and my doctors took me off of prozac and put me on seroquel, telling me i had borderline personality disorder since my feelings were intense, my mood swings were often, and i was exhibiting the bpd symptoms. i felt like i was legitimately going ""crazy."" all i wanted to do was sleep with people, then take my ativan and seroquel and sleep- then do it all again when i woke up. this was my vicious cycle for a few months. 

&gt;during these months, i found myself cutting. i found myself sleeping with strangers. i found myself drinking more than i felt comfortable with. i found myself pushing my friends away, then begging them to come back. life was terrible, and i didn't want to live like that anymore.

&gt;i wanted to kill myself, and after an attempt, i laid in bed for several days realizing i couldn't live like this anymore. i didn't want to go back to therapy, and all i wanted was to get better, but my impulses got the best of me.

&gt;i eventually decided to try to live without my medication. if it worked, then it worked. if it didn't, then nothing would be worse than what i was going through.

How many of you are NOT medicated?,"i've been medicated since i was 13 (i'm 19 now) and have only stopped for a few months before having to go back because i felt like i was going insane, having multiple panic attacks per day, could barely function, and was extremely suicidal. i'm currently weaning off of zoloft and starting prozac and i'm on super low dosages of both since i'm almost off of the zoloft (i started at the highest and now i'm taking half of a pill and soon i'll stop completely) and just started the prozac. my emotional regulation has been nonexistent. on the zoloft i was pretty constantly depressed but now i'm able to feel happiness and have energy and such but everything is so intense and sometimes i'll be fine and then very suddenly and randomly become very panicked and start disassociating. or i'll be  suddenly super super aroused and then immediately deeply depressed and suicidal in just a second. this of course, isn't even close to as intense as it would be if i were to go a month without any medication at all. i've been on just about every antidepressant and a few antipsychotics and some have worked but have bad side effects. wellbutrin was phenomenal but i ended up having a seizure and needed to discontinue it. cymbalta was good and i was on it for a few years but i gained soooo much weight and stopped that too.

Brain Fog at 75mg Lamictal,"i’m looking for advice on where to go from here, with lamictal being helpful but also giving me irritating brain fog. 

i’ve been on lamictal since february. until may it was 25mg a day because i switched doctors in that time. in may i went up to 50 mg, then in june i went up to 75 mg which i have been at for 6 weeks or so. i was prescribed it for bipolar ii and for bpd. 

about two weeks ago i noticed more brain fog than normal. every time i went up in dose before i had brain fog for maybe a week, then it went away. 

this time it hasn’t gone away and persists. sometimes drinking caffeine gets rid of that, but most of the time caffeine only helps slightly and prior to the 75mg lamictal i almost never drank caffeine. 

it’s really annoying because i also have adhd so it basically feels like it’s made all those symptoms worse. it often takes so much effort to think about anything. i feel like i can’t focus on even thinking. reading is even harder than because i can’t focus on the words and sometimes it takes a few seconds to grasp the words. i’m still able to think intelligently, come up with good ideas, etc and i’m not confused, it’s just my brain feels slow and foggy. sometimes i have trouble remembering things or remembering words which never happened before any more than the average person. all of that is really frustrating because i’m a very active and productive person, and all of that has been harder lately. i also feel tired or unmotivated often and it makes me so frustrated sometimes that i start crying. 

it’s also frustrating because the lamictal is really helping. my phq-9 score went from 24 down to 12 since at 75mg. my anxiety has been a lot better. my bipolar seems calm as far as i can tell, and my bpd is so so much better. i’m actually able to be relatively calm about my fp and my suicidal feelings have mostly gone away which is really nice. 

i don’t know what i want my doctor to do though. the brain fog is so annoying but i’m afraid of trying another mood stabilizer because this one helps so well with minimal side effects and i tend to have bad side effects on meds (i’ve  taken zoloft, celexa, and hydroxyzine, and all of them had such horrible side effects and made me feel so much worse so i had to stop all of them) so i’m terrified of trying new meds and because i respond so poorly to most of them. 

i guess i’m just looking advice for where i should go from here.

i've tried soooooo many. quetiapine (25mg, 50mg, at start of episode but i've also tried up to 100mg daily), ativan (0.5mg, 1mg, &amp; 2mg, absolutely zero effect at any dose)  olanzipine 2.5mg dissolving tablets is what they have me on right now, but the first two times i took it, it took almost three hours to kick in (unhelpful).  after that it hasn't affected me at all, though i haven't tried a higher dose yet.

do any of you have prn medications that have helped? i know there's a lot of kickback about xanax and valium but i've read that some people have a good experience with it. 

also, if it's relevant, i've been on lexapro (between 10-40mg for like 8 years, though stopped bc it didn't do anything anymore) zoloft, which made me insanely suicidal, prozac which made me sick and i'm currently on trazodone 100mg for sleep.

Meds!,"so i'm currently on 90mg cymbalta and 100mg lamictal.

i seem to have plateaued and i've got a meds review with a psych tomorrow and i'm considering asking for effexor instead of cymbalta as snris are the only ones that seem to work for me (i've had zoloft 150mg - an ssri - and remeron 45mg - an nassa before).

i dunno if my lamictal needs upping or if i need a different mood stabilizer but i thought it was worth asking if anyone had a similar experience. i read that cymbalta doesn't have any benefits over 60mg but it *can* go up to 120mg daily. fuck knows. help?

I need help. Please give me some advice on what to do.,"i need help. 

about a month ago, i did something that i won’t go into that put me in hospital. while i was in hospital, i was diagnosed with a case of bpd and cptsd. after finding this out, it’s explained a lot of things that i do in life. i’ve been consistently fighting the voice in my head that tells me that everyone hates me, doesn’t want me around, etc. 

a little bit of back story, i was kicked out at the age of 15 because i’d came out as gay. my family was incredibly abusive and raised me as jehovah’s witness. growing up knowing that what i was doing was “wrong” (even though being gay really isn’t wrong) was incredibly tough. i felt like i had my fake life as a witness, and my real life as well, just a gay guy. 

after getting kicked out, i lost everything. both my immediate and extended family, as well as my entire network of friends. this was incredibly hard because, as a jehovah’s witness, you’re not allowed to socialise with anybody outside of the church, so my entire social network was jw’s. i lost all of that, and became homeless.

to fight the voice in my head that started to appear, i turned to drinking and pot. i was homeless at the time, and fell in with a bad crowd which, in that time, i fell into various substance abuses and a lot of unhealthy coping mechanisms.

i ended up getting with a (now-ex) partner, who was absolutely terrible, took advantage of me, both sexually and financially. i really do not want to go into too much detail about this, either, but it’s so hard to forget the things he put me through.

i’ve gone through phases where i absolutely purge every single social media account i have because i feel like nobody actually likes me and i’d be better off just not being a burden to absolutely everybody that i know. 

i also get these random suicidal thoughts out of absolutely nowhere for no reason at all, and the thing is, it actually brings my mood down to the point i just want to end it all so i stop being a burden on everyone. hell, i’m feeling like i’m being too much just by writing this post up, but i seriously do not know how to manage it. i’ve never had anyone tell me anything before. 

i’ve seen doctors about this since i was about 13, and i’ve been put on the following in that time. (not all at once, this is just an idea of what i’ve been taking)

* - *sertraline*

* - *diazepam*

* - *alprazolam*

* - *zolpidem*

* - *desvenlafaxine*

* - *venlafaxine*

i am extremely apprehensive about seeing a doctor, as i’ve been put on numerous different types of medication over the years and i have had no effect from them whatsoever. nothing has helped me at all, in fact, they all make me feel worse to the point i get suicidal/end up doing thing that fuck my life up. at this point i just feel like some sort of pharma guinea-pig they're just feeding pills to to see what shit works. i have a doctor’s appointment scheduled from next week (at the time of writing this post) and in all honesty, i don’t know what to tell them. i just want help. that’s all i want. 

as of now, i’m currently with a partner who is an absolutely lovely person, but i just have this voice in the back of my head, and it’s been so exacerbated as of late for reasons i don’t really quite understand. i keep thinking that he secretly hates me, he doesn’t want me around, all that. the thing about this is, i know this is stupid and foolish, and i know that he wants me around. i just can’t convince myself that.

he’s been incredibly patient with me, but he’s got his own problems too, so i am really worried my problems are just going to put an irreparable strain on this relationship.

i’m just trying to fight this stupid voice in my head that’s telling me to get out and go somewhere else, because nobody really wants me around, and i’m a burden to everyone, everyone secretly hates me etc.. i really don’t want to be thinking like this.

it's also incredibly hard for me to hold work, and i really don't want to be like this. i want to get myself out of this and at least have some success in my life. even if it's a little one. i just want to be ""normal"" again. my life hasn't ever felt the same since i was kicked out and it really, really does pain me to constantly think that i'm like, ""broken"" or something. because that's all the voice in my head is telling me , 24-fucking-7.

First class antipsychotics for BPD?,"i'm currently admitted to a psych ward and they've been giving me huge doses of levometrazin and triapidal (antipsychotics), besides my old prescribed meds (sertraline and quetiapine) which made me feel wonderful . to give some context, i switched psych wards 2 weeks ago and my ex doctor was amazing and really did me good with my old prescription. sertraline and quetiapine literally changed my life . this new doc though, has no experience with bpd (i'm primarily here for detox) , and just keeps me giving enormous amounts of antipsychotics which only makes things worse (i get angry more easily , depressive , no joy in doing things ).

"Really debated posting this; but I think it will serve as a PSA to rule out any biophysical causes of mental distress. This is my ""success"" story, or something like that","this is a new account, but i have posted here many times under others. 

i'm 23 years old and i was diagnosed with bpd at 19, but it was suggested even earlier than that. basically i was a mess. suicidal, depressed, constantly anxious and nauseous, panic attacks, depersonalization, paranoia, uncontrollable rage, ocd and obsessive thinking, etc. it just went on and on. 

i have seen many doctors, expensive psychiatrists out of pocket, dbt, cbt, inpatient dbt programs, i tried everything. i have been on over 15 different psychiatric medications from anticonvulsants to antipsychotics, to ssri's, to benzos, to everything.. 

none of them ever worked very well, except to temporarily put me into some hypomanic like state. last year this time i started zoloft and 4 weeks later i had attempted suicide and was committed to the psychiatric ward after a few days in the hospital recovering. i swallowed a brand new bottle of xanax .5 mg. i didn't know it then but my allergies turned out to save my life (and almost ruin it).

well i got out of the psych ward, back on different meds, tried yoga, tried meditation, still wanted to die. i considered ect to be my only option, that or suicide. almost every day of my life was in agony. i am still in disbelief that i can say all of this in past tense. 


anyways onto the present situation: i have always had bad allergies and extraordinarily itchy legs. i get nauseous a lot, i get headaches, i feel like i am on meth (restless/nervous energy), i get dizzy when i stand up, and i never have an appetite. my whole life i have struggled to maintain a weight in the 90s (lbs). i am 5'6 so i have always been very drastically thin. 

well i had the worst episode of my life of the above mentioned itching and i got to googling. i came across a blog where the girl's story literally mimicked mine. she also spent years being diagnosed as bipolar, borderline, schizo-affective, etc. it turns out she had a histamine intolerance. 

we all know about histamine from allergies, but did you know histamine is in every food you eat? some foods have a lot (red wine, aged cheese, tomatoes, citrus fruits) and some have less. some people's body's can't tolerate this histamine because they have trouble breaking it down (and/or also naturally high levels). 

this is not an allergy, it's a psuedoallergy. it is an intolerance. the effect is cumulative, if i am eating low-histamine and cheat on one meal, it might be okay. but if i've been cheating a lot, it could be recipe for disaster. i never considered food allergies before, i never considered that all of my problems could be related.

i would hate to give anyone false hope, but since i have discovered i am not the only one this has happened too, i felt compelled to share. maybe someone out there shares a similar problem? 


once i went on the low-histamine diet out of desperation, within days my life was different. literally. life changing. i have never felt this way in my life. i don't itch, i have an appetite, i don't puke, i don't scream, i don't feel crippling emptiness, i don't feel insane rushes of adrenaline, i don't panic, i have perspective, i take it in stride. 

i was able to get off of trileptal 300 mg, wellbutrin 300 mg, and xanax .5 mg within days of the diet (under supervision of my psychiatrist.) i feel amazing. i feel calmer and happier than i have in my entire life. 

i was one of the worst cases my psychiatrist has ever had when it comes to borderline/bipolar 2 (my diagnoses, along with ocd and trichotillamania) all of it has disappeared. i can't say it will be this way forever but i sure fucking hope so. 


**if you can, monitor yourself. see doctors, pay attention to what you put in your body and how it makes you feel. look for more answers**

me and my therapist are good friends and we share a theory that most psychiatric illnesses have a direct physical or biochemical cause. the problem is many of these (including histaminosis or histamine intolerance, what i have) are not well known in the us. in germany and austria they are very well known conditions. none of my doctors here have heard of it, despite it being well documented with peer reviewed research. i would have never guessed this in a million years, but i hope someone out there can be helped by this somehow. sorry for the novel 


i hope you are all having a beautiful night. i hope i didn't hurt anyone's feelings with this or piss anyone off. my intentions are good and i want all of you to be in peace.

Has anyone else not had luck with medication?,"i’ve been diagnosed with bpd for about a year now, but i’ve known i had it for a long time. i’ve been on and off antidepressants for about three years, including wellbutrin, lexapro, prozac, and zoloft. i’ve never had any of them give me anything but negative, shitty side effects. the one that worked the best was wellbutrin, until i realized that it was making me feel extremely numb. but, at least i didn’t have the same side effects of no sex drive, headaches, etc. it’s to a point now that they’ve just decided that maybe medication isn’t for me. 

has anyone dealt with the same thing? did you need something that wasn’t an antidepressant? i’ve wondered about anxiety medications, too, since i do have a lot of anxiety day to day and i took ativan (i think) a couple of times in the hospital and found that it really, really helped.

Ssri and bpd,"tw: idk i’m a big manic rn so if that come through sorry or if it triggers you please don’t read just incase, take care loves!!

dose anyone with bpd here have a good experience with ssri’s. i don’t, i don’t have a bad experience, it literally does nothing. i took myself off 20mg lexapro overnight (after 5 months) nothing. i took myself off of 150mg zoloft overnight after 5 months nothing. no side effects no withdrawals.

i’m convinced i have no problems with my serotonin levels but no professionals want to listen. i know medication needs time but i felt like i was on a sugar pill. i tried seeing my psychiatrist after three weeks (i really need to be on sum to help now i’m desperate) and they set my next appointment 4 months away. they keep telling me i need to tell them how to help and what do i even want, they’ve told me to go private aswell. i can’t afford that my dads not working and my mams working 16 hr weeks (still entitled to nothing in ireland). so they said they were too busy for me and i should go to the emergency hospital. 

so i went he was just condescending me the whole time. i got pissed off and told him i don’t want to hear about any “sleep hygiene” “mindfulness” shite. he was obvs going on to that so he started to get annoyed and got more condescending. 

i’m a small 19 almost 20 girl but i’ve a baby face so they usually think i haven’t seen things or sum idk. anyways i stormed out after that he let me leave without any meds on my back.

he must’ve copped on cause he rang me near midnight saying he was actually worried about me and said he’d call my psychiatrist and tell him to get me an earlier appointment. it’s been a week and i haven’t heard back. 

so i went to my gp as a last resource absolutely grasping for anyone to help me, i asked if she could put me on the meds i’ve heard good things about (venlafaxine wellbutrin) she ended up being like, well it’d be s but cheeky of her to go behind my psychiatrists back for meds. 
i up crying in hysterics again saying stuff like “am i not the priority” like fuck being all pals with them, help the bleeding patient in front of you. she ended up tell me she used to work st my psychiatrists office and she’s feel bad or some shite. didn’t even think of asking for a second opinion. just left €55 down the drain, damn yous with obamacare and nhs 🙄

but anyways yeah that’s the story of how my mental sector is basically a cult. 
but yeah i’m i rambled i’m s bit manic but here is venlafaxine and wellbutrin good if ssris don’t work that was like the original question i just got really angry and needed a vent too idk.

Is Zoloft/Sertraline making me paranoid?,"so i started taking zoloft 25mg on january 11 and after a week moved up to 50 mg which i have taken 2 doses of so far. my doctor prescribed it for gad with depressive symptoms but she also thinks i have bpd and less chance but also possibly bipolar. she discussed me trying zoloft and seeing if they eventually need to put me on a mood stabilizer. 

in general the zoloft has made me feel worse mentally and emotionally (way more anxious than normal, mood swings are more intense than normal, moods cycle faster, i get really hyper, last night i was really depressed for several hours, i have the strongest craving/need to do self destructive things like get drunk and do drugs and overeat because i sometimes am struck by terrible emptiness and feel so nihilistic at times, i haven’t done any of those things but i have been more impulsive and have been driving more recklessly than i did before zoloft and buying dumb things, as well as needing to use my self harm alternatives) since taking the first dose, as well as physical side effects like my ears ringing ever since i went up to 50 mg. 

anyways, today for more than an hour i’ve been suffering from derealization/depersonalization, which was common for me before zoloft, except today it’s lasted more than an hour whereas before it only lasted while having a panic attack but i’m not having a panic attack right now, i’m just really anxious. also i feel like i can physically feel sounds touching my ear drums like asmr but it’s all sounds. 

i also don’t know whether this counts as paranoid ideation but i was freaking out on the way to work because with the dp/dr, the existence of other people became terrifying to me. seeing them sitting in their cars driving was freaking me out and i almost started crying because i was scared. i also keep feeling panicked when i look at other people because i get the idea that maybe they are thinking about me or talking about me or following me. i know none of this is actually true. i know logically that these ideas are ridiculous, i know i’m not having full-blown paranoia or a break with reality, but everything feels really weird and surreal right now. is that paranoid ideation or just anxiety? 

it’s taking so much effort to not be weird at work and to keep up the illusion i am normal even though none of the people i am talking to seem like they’re real but i still know i have to act like they are (and logically i know they are real and that the world is real even if it doesn’t feel like it)

Advice - what meds for me could I advice to my psychiatrist?,"friends fellow sufferers,
i am going to psychiatrist in friday.
through seven years i tried various antipsychotics and antidepressants.
in my country we have a saying: even a blind chicken finds a seed now and then. that is how i feel from using the right drugs for me, like a blind chicken who is searching for a right seed.
here is the list i used so far:

antipsychotics:
quentiapine - its actually best mood stabilizer but i sleep with it 12 to 14 hours a day, i get extra weight, but i dont mind it, as long as it works.
abilify - i tried this for couple of days, i just couldnt stand consuequences. i couldnt sit straight for 10 minutes, my heart was beating like mad, it was like demon was inside of me.
fluphenazinchlorid - i tried this in small dosage, but it seems it has no effect on me, and i feel i cant focus on it.

antidepressants:
escitalopram - it kicked in after 7 to 8 weeks of feeling very nervous and anxious, but it lasted only three months and less.
zoloft - i took it for three months. it didnt helped at all, it just made me more cranky and nervous.

anxiolytics:
oksazepam - im using this for my sleep for around five years and more. but if im using it during the day, i feel like im more addicted and its less helpful.

my friends, any piece of advice could be helpful. thanks!",1551907363,False,BPD,2019-03-06 21:22:43,"Advice - what meds for me could I advice to my psychiatrist? friends fellow sufferers,

A rant/experience,"it's been 2 years since i've taken it but i'm scared of being prescribed lamtrogine/lamictal again because of how awful i felt. 

i'm not trying to self diagnose but there aren't many good doctors in my country and they simply jump to the most common disorders. 

i've visted 3 doctors and each diagnosed and prescribed different things and i haven't gone since 2 years ago and i'm ready to go again because i've been in limbo.

anyway, i'm wondering if anyone could guess which disorder is most likely correct from my symptoms and experience from past meds.

i'm feeling completely unsatisfied with my life but with no intention of doing anything that might harm me but i'm just stuck not doing anything. just feeling apathy or depression and rarely do i get sudden bursts or energy but i mostly use them for cleaning the house. usually i'm hyperfixating on really useless things, like binging tv shows i don't even enjoy. so does this sound like borderline personality disorder? i just never felt that to be true for me. 

1st doctor prescription/ diagnosis bpd: i tried lamictal which made me rapid cyle and cry for hours and i hated my life the 3 months i took it for and ended up breaking up with my long term boyfriend on it. 

2nd doctor prescription/ diagnosis depression: i took lexapro and risperidone during my exams and i was most stable on that combo and before that i took abilify too but something felt off taking 2 antipsychotics and i don't remmeber why i hated abilify more.

3rd doctor prescription/ didn't even tell me a diagnosis: zoloft which was horrible, peak apathy and indifference. truly felt like a zombie, the opposite of lamictal.

Dangers of Mistreatment in BPD patients [TW: Mental Hospital],"allow me to preface this by stating this is my personal experience, and my view on this doesn't apply to every circumstance and situation. bpd can manifest itself in many forms, symptoms, etc. every case is different. however, i'd like to share my story. 

i have textbook bpd, all 9/9 of the dsm criteria. i have a professional diagnosis too, if that's something that matters to anyone. i've struggled with a lack of identity, emotion regulation, fear of abandonment, and all of that good stuff. my interpersonal relationships are turbulent, to say the least. 

only... no one believed me, when i'd try to tell anyone that i was struggling. i had a crying fit one night at age 17, and ended up in an emergency mental health facility. these kinds of facilities are in place for people who are violent, attempted suicide, or are having an episode of psychosis. my memory of this time is absolute crap, so i can't offer too many specifics, except that a friend feared i would end my life after some self-injury behavior, and suddenly there were policemen at my door. 

i can't even tell you anything about what happened at the emergency mental health place, but i remember the crisis specialist wearing a beige blouse, and i cried for the duration of the visit, including on the way there in the car during the police escort. this single event in itself has changed my whole life, irrevocably. this was nearly 7 years ago (coming up in november) and these actions can't be reversed.

after that night, my family went scrambling for immediate help, in the form of any type of mental health professional they could get. while i'd tried to warn people, i didn't do a good enough job, because it seems that things got out of control, and quickly in hindsight. the first port of call, in fact the only ""counselor"" in the area who had any immediate availability was a social worker. at 17, i was having trouble controlling impulses and reckless behavior, as well as paranoia. it sent anxiety through the roof when she insisted on talking to a parent without me in the room after a session. on my fourth session with her, she listened to me for about 5 minutes before stopping me to say, ""if my granddaughter ever acted the way you did, she'd be disowned."" i never went back to her. 

i honestly have no idea how much time passed between then and when i got to see my first psychiatrist. he was chronically late, rude, and had such a remarkably low affect, i didn't feel comfortable. so he started me immediately on zoloft. i think that's the tylenol of mental health medication. it wasn't long until i was able to get in somewhere else, a friendlier looking practice. i would come to have this doctor for around 5 years. 

within one session, she diagnosed me as bipolar. i accepted it, stupidly, without question. sessions were brutal, i'd even say in one she committed a serious form of malpractice. i didn't question her on her speedy diagnosis, and to this day i don't know why. immediately, this pill-happy doctor cycled me through many different types of benzos, mood stabilizers, and eventually antipsychotics. 

it was under this doctor's care that i seriously fell through the cracks. within a year of the crying episode, i'd be committed. 

for the sake of honesty, i'll admit i don't remember what led up to being dropped off at the door of a psych hospital. i've lost a few years of memory, really. what comes back is in bits and pieces. i think my brain is trying to protect me. 

the psych hospital, in short, scared the shit out of me. i don't remember the outside of the building or what it looked like, but i remember the doors. the big, scary, slamming doors that locked behind us wherever we went. thankfully, i was placed with the adolescents and not the adult unit, largely because i was still in school. i can still smell the nasty eggs they made for breakfast everyday. today, i was making coffee, and a flashback came back of the dead, vacant eyes of the fellow patients. the patients were so drugged up, they couldn't all work normally, most of them shuffled around the decrepit building with tattered pajamas and slippers. 

it's coming up to six years of this experience, and flashbacks still hit me hard, all the time. i remember my room mates, one homicidal, the other schizophrenic. all under the age of 15. i think about the writing on the wall, all in magic marker as we were not allowed anything other than soft markers or crayons. ""help me,"" was the message that stood out the most.

this didn't happen to me, but it did happen to someone in my unit. the staff does vital checks in the night. this is often terrifying, because you'll wake up suddenly and have someone standing over you. another patient reported that the aid covered their mouth as they were waking up, so that the patient wouldn't scream. when this patient protested, they were given a shot of tranquilizer. no matter how good reviews a hospital has, there is often behavior that is rigid and degrading to patients that goes unreported.

during the duration of my stay, i was cycled through more antipsychotics including seroquel. my psych didn't look like he ever wanted me released. i was getting worse the longer i spent there, and i was there a few months. i grew more insular. as someone who had bpd as opposed to bipolar, i never learned to cope with the world. 

that's what i'm wrestling with today, this year, all the time. i was drugged up, not taught to cope. a year after i was released, i was put on abilify. this drug caused dramatic, life-altering changes for me. this includes a serious weight gain (i'm talking 90-95 lbs in four years), the occasional tremor, and now i'm looking at type 2 diabetic symptoms and pcos. i have since received a proper diagnosis, i have been taken off the antipsychotics safely. i am working on getting my physical health under control, even while my mental health is suffering. i have terrible sensory issues, hyper-vigilance. i don't trust mental health professionals anymore, although i am starting dbt next week. had i been properly treated and diagnosed, i know i wouldn't gotten the help i need.

the point i'm trying to drive home in this post is that not all mental health treatments are one-size-fits all. by that i mean, if you're unsure about a diagnosis, get a second eval! don't let a doctor intimidate you, and if you find yourself in turmoil, get targeted therapy. my issue with long-term hospitalization for bpd patients is that they are not taught to deal with the real world. i don't want what happened to me to happen to anyone else. thank you for reading.

Ever wondered what it’s like to be in a relationship with someone with BPD?,"there is a lot of words here. please save it and read when you can. tw: note that there are references to abuse, rape and some other things that may be triggering. i typed this while in different cycles, and have not proof read as it is too painful right now. i apologise for any mistakes. 


day 1

i’ve learned a lot about myself in the last year. i’ve learned what it is i need to work on and i know what a long and difficult road it will be to notice differences in those things. i write this as someone who has lost the thing that gave them the determination to acknowledge, to research, to become aware. it isn’t something i can do alone, and it’s not something i can afford to do quickly. 

i wanted to write something, because i have been embarrassed at how i react. sometimes so publicly, with so much spite. it’s as though i want someone to feel all the hurt i’ve ever felt. it’s childish, it’s humiliating and it’s not an excuse but i seem incapable of stopping it. 

i only ever feel good or bad or nothing. there is no in between, no moment i feel a bit of both. no moment where i feel a bit bad, but good enough that i can talk about it sensibly, resolve it and move on. when a bad thing happens, even if it’s minor, a lot of bad things come back at once. sometimes, it’s clear that’s what’s happening and on rare days i can control myself better, i can stop myself from escalating a situation from nothing to something difficult to repair. on the more frequent bad days, i realise what i’m doing but only after using past hurt as a weapon. sometimes that person causes it. sometimes they have not been there for me in a way i need, but can’t explain. on other days, it doesn’t feel so clear. all the pain i’ve experienced just gels into a thick paste that covers everything that was ever good. i can’t recognise that what i’m feeling is pain beyond the situation that i’m in. 

a bad day starts with distancing, promises that i’m fine, a genuine but futile attempt to stop myself in my tracks. i will say this while vacantly staring at walls, scratching my chest, avoiding eye contact, changes in the way i speak, address people, acknowledge people, changes in the way i act. i feel incapable of stopping my reactions, so saying i’m fine seems a bit pointless. but i say it, and every time i hope it just disappears, but it doesn’t. physically, it feels like my head is vibrating. all the painful things just bouncing from side to side against my skull. when i shut my eyes, i visualise nothing. there is nothing but black. when i focus on what i can hear, there is a loud buzzing noise, with the world continuing quietly in the background. people who are close to me and addressing me directly feel and sound miles away. 

dissociation. what feels like the mental equivalent of running away. i disappear. the previous strong, painful emotions seem to numb. exactly the same as when you take some paracetamol for a headache and you have the few minutes of it getting better but not feeling quite right? that’s it. bpd is the headache, and dissociation is the painkiller. 

but here is the problem. now, i feel nothing. it happens most times. i start to feel a lot, so i guess my mind attempts to protect itself by removing anything that might evoke emotion. if this really was just a headache, that wouldn’t be an issue. but this isn’t, this is a huge cancerous tumour that is swelling my the second. so the painkiller can only numb it for so long. i wish i could capitalise on it. make the most of the numbness, somehow use it to avoid an escalation. i just can’t. it’s like i’m not there, the people around me aren’t there, i hear that people are speaking but i can’t process it, i often can’t respond or have limited, child-like speech. i can’t move, and become dehydrated quickly. i don’t like to be touched or comforted. while writing this, i realise that if i could accept affection while in this state, it may make a positive difference to how i am when i float back down to earth. 

while writing this i have also realised, that upon the many discoveries i have made in my quest to understand my mental abnormalities, that i have never known what causes the dissociation period to end. i realise now that i have little memory of what happens during those times. maybe i don’t like being touched because it begins the reintroduction into reality? maybe that’s why i can’t speak. am i in some sort of paralytic dream-like state? i am certain of one thing, the paralysis is different depending on the emotion i’m withholding. 

but for whatever reason, it always does end. there always gets to a point where there’s not a force capable of holding it - whatever it is - back from rearing it’s ugly head. my anger, my sadness, my euphoria, they are powerful. you can almost see, and smell and taste it. as it’s been the most frequent of late, we will discuss the anger. you can sense the eruption in every way. time to walk on eggshells. a friend of mine once said that ‘there are a million ways to get it wrong, and only one to get it right’. that is something that weighs the heaviest to me. how helpless must you feel to be someone trying to make another feel more grounded, to find that you can’t. if you’re lucky enough to find something that works, don’t relax just yet because it won’t every time. 

and then the cycle of hurt continues. and i don’t remember always the specifics, i just remember how that person has made me feel before. any time they’ve ever got it wrong, it comes flooding in at once and it’s just so unbearable, so consuming. i can’t sleep it off, i shut my eyes and all i see is cars crashing. i don’t really know where this comes from but i suppose it’s just another, more simple way of visualising a disaster i feel is out of my control. there is nothing but pain, there are no positive thoughts i can use to try and replace the negative ones. 

it is exhausting. whatever the emotion is, it’s the same cycle. i feel all the anger, or all the sad, or all the happiness. i martyr the people i love and then kick the ladder from under their feet and watch them plummet and become someone i have demonised. it all goes back to the same issue. to me, someone can only be good or bad. a person that causes pain or relieves it. there’s no middle ground, there’s no chance of being a good person that makes mistakes. just good or bad. 

the emotional manipulation is heavy. it’s difficult to prevent, because i feel so strongly one way or the other. i’m so afraid of being alone, losing someone i love. the first sign of abandonment, i will feel so adamant that my life is better without them. leave, if that’s what you want. leave, i want you to. i never wanted you. you have ruined me. the way i feel is because of the things you do. i become so abusive, so defensive. and what follows that is sheer desperation at the thought of losing the person i told to leave. i think any one who has ever loved me, has felt trapped. it’s not okay, it’s never been okay i know that but i just don’t know how to stop. i can’t imagine how it feels for someone being with me in these states. like if you leave, you live with the consequences of me not being able to cope. just like everything else, the desperation and panic controls me. i’m pretty likely to cause physical harm to myself, overdose, drive in conditions i shouldn’t be driving in.

and then i apologise. i beg for forgiveness. i promise things will be different and that i can change. i so desperately want them to. i feel like i can’t breathe until i am loved again. i try so hard to stay calm and not react to things, not to make someone feel so awful about themselves about something so minor. something i know myself won’t matter in hours to come. why is the force that takes over me so strong that i can’t prevent a reaction? anyway, this lasts for a couple of days, generally. vary rarely more than a week. all the things that piss me off during an angry cycle seem to not affect me. the person is martyred again. they can do no wrong. 

so i love big, and i love strong and i love so much that it tempts people in. i know it can make others feel amazing about themselves, having someone that hangs on your every word, someone that is 100% interested in every move you make, every word you say. someone who validates you constantly. doesn’t stop letting you know the positive impact you’ve made on their life. someone that genuinely puts your life ahead of their own. will cancel their plans and put yours first. it’s easy to fall into the trap. it is nice, and not all that common to be loved to the extent that i mean. it can make the awful bits, the manipulative bits, seem worth it. it seems like it’s an easy thing to do, walk away from manipulation. it’s not so easy to walk away from this side of it though. 

my perception of the people i love the most changes constantly and rapidly. i no longer know what is real or what is imagined. i no longer know who to trust and who to avoid. i don’t know who to cut from my life, and who to keep. i feel like i’m losing my mind a bit more each day, my grasp on reality has faded and all my lines are so blurred. i don’t know where my boundaries are, or who is crossing them and when. i don’t know what is forgiveness and what is a desperate desire to not be alone. i don’t know what it is to love separately from what it is to need. i don’t know what thoughts or feelings of mine are genuine any more. 

this is, believe it or not, a short version of what it’s like being in a relationship with someone who has an untreated mental illness. it’s harder than you could imagine. add some lovely fresh trauma to that, and you’ve got yourself a permanent rollercoaster of emotion that will, probably, be difficult to sever your ties with. i don’t ever want the people i love to feel trapped. i am sorry for what some people have endured, and i’m sorry for the neglect i’ve placed on others. 


day 2. 

i write this cautiously. i feel so different to how i felt yesterday. so numb. the lines that draw my boundaries are more blurred than ever, today. i feel like a different person, living through the same situation but with a different outlook. i feel more objective. like i’m looking at the situation from more angles than just my own. 

i thought about what i wrote yesterday. i still believe a lot of it is true, but i think i was more justified in my reactions than i wanted to give myself credit for. the person who i love the most hurt me time and time again. he gave little consideration as to how you fix a mistake, a mistake like cheating on me with your ex, the mother of your child, someone who will remain in our lives forever. did he give any real consideration at all in how you work to fix that? 

or did he keep lying, day after day? or did he lie sometimes and other times let his own resentment for how hard he had to work to try and fix things take things take leadership, so like telling the truth but not caring enough to really convince me? there have been lies. there have been lies about who he is speaking to, there have been hidden social media accounts that he kept me blocked on. there have been conversations with the woman in question in which he lied multiple times, about them ever taking place and their content - about how he misses her. there have been lies about what he is really thinking?

now that last one can’t be proved, but with a years worth of other lies, am i really that crazy for thinking it might be? how 5 days ago he told me we would face anything together, and moments later told me there is no hope. he can’t help how he feels. i’m so angry, i am so fucking hurt. is it a lie or did he just feel that differently that quickly? was he maybe even lying to himself?

regardless, i begged. i promised myself i wouldn’t, but i did. i asked if there would ever still be hope for me to prove i can change and make him happy again. he said ‘always’. i told him everything that has changed for me. what i’m going to do to be better. what changes i have made to improve myself and be someone capable of accepting love again. i told him why it is different now, and what made me complacent before. i think i meant it all. i really do think things can change. therapy starts for me on 20th, i have new medication (again), the lockdown in the uk eases on 12th. there are more opportunities for me to try something different than there has been since we started dating. 

he was interested. he said he would come round to talk. i was ready. i felt 100% like it was the right decision, to keep trying. i love him and my life without him seems so directionless and empty. i was planning what to say, how to make him turn my 1% chance into a possibility, and then into a probability, and then a reality. i was brimming with excitement. i felt hope again. 

i shouldn’t have begged, i know. the trouble with using emotional manipulation is it tends to get you what you need to stop the pain. sometimes, when i’m in extreme emotional suffering, which is unfortunately more common for me than some other people, once again, due to the splitting and only ever seeing good or bad, i have imagined physical pains. i clench my jaw so tightly that it starts to feel like my teeth are falling out, my whole face is on fire and i can’t stop clutching at my jaw and applying pressure desperately trying to relieve it. again, it’s all pretty fucked up. often, the pain doesn’t exist. i have many pain killers to hand, after jumping 45ft to escape a potential murderer and confirmed rapist, and a car crash. i am stacking. i take codeine, naproxen, tramadol. even morphine. the pain is relentless, it doesn’t stop. i take handfuls. it does not stop. but take away whatever is causing anxiety, whether it’s ending an argument or taking valium or being admitted to hospital and replacing the anxiety with something new. it goes. and i’m just left uncomfortably numb. 

i am ashamed to admit, that the physical and the emotional distress causes me to use manipulation tactics to feel better. i avoid it at all costs but just like the rest of it, i really just can’t stop sometimes. if i’m given a window, i will use it. so i begged. he texted me saying he was sad and lost, and when i said i was too, he asked if i wanted to see him. i have asked him to stop texting. i have told him if you give me anything to hang on to, i will use it. he continued to text me. asking where i am, if i got home okay etc. 

i tried. i tried the sensible option of saying no, because it will hurt more when he leaves but i couldn’t stop thinking. there is always hope - for as long as he cares how i feel, there must be. so i asked what i asked about, you know if the window is still open for me and like i said, i was all excited and then it left. i’m not joking, i could feel it leave my body like going from hot to cold in just a second. emotional chilblains. he said not to start thinking in a week it would all be forgotten about and we would be back to normal. 

i switched. i wondered how he would have the audacity to warn me. i thought about every time he has hurt me. i previously said that sometimes i feel the blanket, the reminder of hurt, not what it was specifically that happened. today wasn’t that. today the specific details came back. every time he has ever lied. every time he put his feelings ahead of mine. every time he promised me the world and never delivered. i remembered it all. i remembered feeling it, hearing it. i remember seeing his face as he has to explain why he chose to lie. i could feel my heart racing again, like it did at the time. i could feel the cold. for some reason, in certain anxiety-inducing situations, i find i feel cold rather than hot - like i said before, i can feel the heat leave my body.  i felt that. every time i shut my eyes, this time i could see him and i sitting in my car. i picked i different lie each time and relived each experience like it was happening again. the songs i was listening to. me begging for the truth. sitting side by side, not looking in each others eyes, me driving aimlessly hundreds of miles, begging begging begging. his face, i think about it, i think about the look he gets when he’s been caught out again and god, why did i ever bother? why would i care so much about someone who done so much damage?

now here’s the bit that’s interesting. i felt all of that. he texted me saying he ‘believes that i can be different but needs to see it’ and ‘not to expect us to be back together in a week’ at 12.58. i replied saying i need some resolutions from you too, and that i don’t want things back to normal without change considering he’s hurt me periodically for a year at 13.01. i texted him saying i don’t want him to come round, i am not trying any more, i don’t know why i ever thought i would, told him to stop texting me and fucking with my head etc - i texted this at 13.02. 

in 3-4 minutes, i relived a year of lies. i relived every time he promised he would be there and let me down. every time i cried myself to sleep and he wasn’t there. every time he lost his shit at me without reason. i didn’t just remember it. i relived it. every smell, every taste. like i was there. 

in 4 minutes. in 4 minutes i went from feeling like my life wasn’t worth living without him, and cutting my legs with broken shards of glass, emptying pills into a glass and drinking vodka at 10am, to thinking the only life not worth living, is the one i share with him. in 4 minutes i went from wanting to try anything to save us, to wanting to hear him say he was wrong for how he treated me too - enough that it took over anything else that was important. 

it’s been about 2 hours, and i feel nothing. i feel indifferent. even as i type, he doesn’t cross my mind. i can’t visualise his face, or his voice. i can’t imagine the comfort of his arms around my shoulders and pulling me in. i’m typing it, but i can’t feel it any more. i don’t feel sad, or happy, nor angry. i feel as though i am a passenger. i don’t feel hot or cold. the tv is on, but i can’t concentrate on it. i’ve watched the last episode of behind her eyes 4 times this morning. it’s like i’m phasing in and out of consciousness. 

i feel nothing. and i think one thing, over and over again. am i going crazy? am i wrong for expecting allowances for my behaviour on the basis that not only can i not help it, but unavoidable and extreme trauma towards someone you love should create some sort of shield? that i can have an exceptionally bad day without extreme consequence. like i can snap and he understands and comforts rather than being anger. he used to, and we were so happy. he handled it in such a moving way, so gracious and so strong. he wouldn’t let me walk over him, but had some leniency before retaliation. 

am i crazy? is it wrong to expect that? i never did, but he told me he would make things better for me and to trust him and to date him. i don’t hold any resentment there today, i understand how someone could feel like they can save you when they don’t understand the extent of the damage. on another day, i hate him with every molecule for not listening to me and being so naive. on other days, i love him more, for knowing how hard it would be and still having that faith and wanting to try regardless. 

i was wrong when i said that all my lines are blurred. there is only one today. the line of human decency, the power of love and what to expect from people. i don’t know if i’m wrong to think he could’ve handled it 1000 times better on 1000 different occasions.

i am certain of one thing today. i will not text him. i will not say i was wrong to say i won’t try. i will not apologise. i will, however, shower, and do my hair and put on some make up, and stay awake and sober-ish. just in case he surprises me, comes bursting through my door saying he will try as hard as i want to. just in case. 

day 3. 

today is a hateful day. today is one of the ones where i am a good person, and he is a bad person. today is the opposite of day 1. i guess day 2 was my dissociation period. everything hurts so much today. it’s like how yesterday started, but without the relieving numbness after it. it’s actually the evening of the same day, but it feels like i’ve been in pain for weeks and months, not literally a couple of hours. 

i wrote him a letter. i’m not going to send it, but i couldn’t articulate how i was feeling without addressing him directly. so i will use that letter in place of me talking through my feelings. 

‘one last thing i will say for you to think about. realise that i cannot truly forgive, if i do not understand. i have told you why i can’t bring it (the cheating and other lies) up in a calm way, and i hope that, overall, i’ve created a relationship where you feel comfortable being honest with me and telling me the whole truth, and talking about it long enough that you might understand it better yourself shouldn’t be the most terrifying thing? 

i’ve told you it is what i need. transparency is the most expected thing to want after being cheated on, yet on and off for different reasons you make it seem like it’s such a difficult task for you, or like you’re always fucking it up. it’s not that difficult, and your responses to the times i have something to bring up, increasingly make the situation worse and put me in a position where i don’t feel comfortable any more, so now i’m defensive. we can’t have a conversation about anything real, because from the moment you cunt off, we are just battling against each other being defensive and then apologetic. these times, and absolutely no other times but the times where it seems like you’ve lied or deceived or avoided the truth - if you want things to work, you have to learn to put your feelings to the side to hear what i’m saying before it escalates to something bigger - like me just thinking you’re nasty or you don’t want me because i’m useless and i don’t try or i’m wrong to feel how i feel or i should’ve gotten over it by now. you take away the part of me, that no matter how angry, would always still explain why i feel how i feel, and you would understand better and not feel as angry!! you make me close up. i have never and will never expect you to not react when it’s not directly related to you cheating on me and it being something i’ve told you i need your help to heal from. anything else, react as you want - it won’t go as terribly as you think. 

so that place i create for you, and you might not feel it much any more, but the one where you can tell me anything and i will listen. the times immediately after where i would let you talk and not get mad - they come back if one: you use them to benefit our relationship in some way and two: if you give me those same spaces when i need them, even at the expense of how you feel. i did that for you - i let myself hurt so i could be someone you spoke to about what you done. you were that person for me once. you are not any more. 

you start a conversation with me about it. you tell me how sick you feel at what you done and how you wonder if you could ever forgive yourself. you remind yourself it’s the worst thing you’ve done and to someone that had only ever loved you. and then you talk to me. and i talk back, and i get the answers that i want. ‘it just happened’ isn’t good enough, neither is self sabotage or you were reminded of the way things used to be. i don’t give a fuck if you want to get over it, you get over it with me by helping me. i deserve that from you. i want the loose ends tied, i want specifics. i want you to fucking hear me when i say that your honesty about what happened and why, will never hurt more than every time i am reminded that there is more to this that i am yet to learn. it is a safe place. i want to know. i beg you time and time again. i want you to feel how i feel just for a day, and use it to help us. help me trust you won’t do it again. help me believe your version by telling me how you felt, and not just what you done. i can’t bring this up, because you act like this. you get defensive. you know i still don’t trust you, you know i still struggle most days with what happened - but i need you to be ready, on your terms, and want to talk to me and finally help me heal. 

but you don’t.

i’ve come to realise that when i’m not dealing with the trauma you put me through, i can be an amazing person. i can be kind, considerate, empathetic, loving, loyal, unwavering. increasingly, i am none of those things when i am with you and i don’t want to lose sight of the person i worked hard to be. i will not let you, my dad, my rapist, or anyone else that has caused me years worth of psychological damage be the same people that cause me to lose my character and who i am as a person. you took my trust, and that is all you will take. i will not give you the release of knowing that i caused this by staying with you, as much as you caused it with your actions. 

just know that i have tried. you tell me every time i have an issue with your lack of transparency that you feel i don’t try at all. but i try every day to word things a little kinder, to not act like every issue is the end of our relationship. i try to give you space to explain before i accuse. i try every day by cuddling you to sleep and by waking up with you each morning. i try, when i say i love you even on the days i don’t think you deserve to hear it. i try every time there is someone that has been as loyal to me as i have them, that i let down to spend time reconciling with you. 

i do not deserve to have my feelings ridiculed and put down. you created a victim, so you allow that victim the space they need to heal at your own expense or you walk away. you do not, and unfortunately, for a long time will not have the same right to anger that i have. i recognise that you’re a human being with reactions, regardless of the past - but it is your responsibility to manage those reactions in a way that lets me feel openly about what you done and what you continue to do when you deceive. 

you have put too much attention on trying to make our days perfect and argument-free rather than real. you work on today rather than the future. you live in some sort of fear of being reminded about what you done, and somehow expect me to absorb that, alone, every day. 

you chose to date a girl that had been brutally raped and kidnapped just a couple of months before dating you. whose parents explosive separation caused her to have no contact with either of them. who had been wrestling with loneliness and mental health disorders. i don’t expect you to understand how to manage that without my help - but i expected you to stay faithful. 

you can downplay it as much as you want, and you can say i’m using it as an excuse, but does it really matter? the reality is, you sat in a police interview room with me, as the one person i was allowed to bring with me due to covid-19. you held my hand and cried with me as you watched a monster get sentenced to over 20 years in prison. you heard every second of what i endured that day - what he said to me, what he done to me and sat with me knowing there was more endurance to come. that 3 days before you sat in that room with me, you made a decision to be unfaithful. you heard me say in my witness impact statement that i don’t know how i will ever trust someone again. it’s not an excuse, it is a fact.  

i can’t continue to try while you sit there blaming the victim you helped create.’

what i want to say, or rather scream in his face before melting to the floor, is how dare he? how dare he let me fall in love with him, put me through this and then leave me? he should be begging, not me. he should be the one who feels like they’ve lost someone who made their life great - not me. as i write this, the self resentment is closing in so i can’t really say it with as much conviction as i would’ve done an hour ago. 

maybe we are both just awful. maybe we just weren’t right. maybe i am a little bit crazy, or completely fucked up. maybe he is a bit of a dickhead and maybe he could’ve been better. maybe i’ve been gaslit for months and that has fucked my perception on reality. that’s what my friends say, my colleagues, people that know us both. they say he was wrong to treat me how he did, and i have nothing to feel this crippling self loathing for. maybe i’ve gaslit them into thinking that. 

my head feels like ants. like white noise. like tens of millions of these little dots and lines just vibrating around between my eyes. 

i have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder for 12 years. i have ptsd. i have tried lithium, venlafaxine, sodium volproate, citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, mirtazapine and quetiapine, that i can remember. many more from years ago, but these are the ones most recently. i haven’t found one effective enough to keep me out of hospital and safe. i certainly have not found anything that balances my mood. they are good for different things, some have helped me get to sleep, stay asleep, some have given me a head start on happiness in the mornings, some have turned the buzzing noise down on some of the days. 

i have had talking therapy. mainly for ptsd. i have learned about grounding techniques, but nothing that has helped in my relationship. i have seen 7 different therapists/psychiatrists in the last 14 months. i have been firm in what i need, and that is not trauma focused therapy but dbt. the more recent psychiatrists have agreed, and the ball is rolling, i have my first session with a ‘specialist’ on 20th april and i refuse to stop telling people what i need until i get it. i am grateful to have health professionals on my side, after many years of them working against me. 

dbt is hard to find. not all therapists offer it and it is expensive. you need individual sessions and group sessions to the tune of around £125 a week. it’s made more difficult by being only phone or zoom based now. i know i have slightly different ways of projecting myself based on the medium, so i hope for face to face sessions to resume soon. i have looked into rehabs. i would say that what i experience is not much different to an addiction. rather than taking something i know is bad in the long run, i say something. i guess it’s all to do with feeling a lack of control over my actions. rehab will be my next step. this will cost £3000 for 3 months, with 12 months of follow ups.


thank you everyone that took the time to read this. i am not looking for your opinions on my relationship. i just needed to vent. i thought it may even help someone. maybe someone reading this feels the same buzzing i do, and this might help them recognise it. maybe it’s your partner, and reading this helps you to identify the issues and work with them to get better. it helps me to write, and to try and organise my thoughts and i appreciate that this is insanely wordy, but it’s a relief to type and another relief to post.",1616942423,False,BPD,2021-03-28 14:40:23,"Ever wondered what it’s like to be in a relationship with someone with BPD? there is a lot of words here. please save it and read when you can. tw: note that there are references to abuse, rape and some other things that may be triggering. i typed this while in different cycles, and have not proof read as it is too painful right now. i apologise for any mistakes. 


day 1

i’ve learned a lot about myself in the last year. i’ve learned what it is i need to work on and i know what a long and difficult road it will be to notice differences in those things. i write this as someone who has lost the thing that gave them the determination to acknowledge, to research, to become aware. it isn’t something i can do alone, and it’s not something i can afford to do quickly. 

i wanted to write something, because i have been embarrassed at how i react. sometimes so publicly, with so much spite. it’s as though i want someone to feel all the hurt i’ve ever felt. it’s childish, it’s humiliating and it’s not an excuse but i seem incapable of stopping it. 

i only ever feel good or bad or nothing. there is no in between, no moment i feel a bit of both. no moment where i feel a bit bad, but good enough that i can talk about it sensibly, resolve it and move on. when a bad thing happens, even if it’s minor, a lot of bad things come back at once. sometimes, it’s clear that’s what’s happening and on rare days i can control myself better, i can stop myself from escalating a situation from nothing to something difficult to repair. on the more frequent bad days, i realise what i’m doing but only after using past hurt as a weapon. sometimes that person causes it. sometimes they have not been there for me in a way i need, but can’t explain. on other days, it doesn’t feel so clear. all the pain i’ve experienced just gels into a thick paste that covers everything that was ever good. i can’t recognise that what i’m feeling is pain beyond the situation that i’m in. 

a bad day starts with distancing, promises that i’m fine, a genuine but futile attempt to stop myself in my tracks. i will say this while vacantly staring at walls, scratching my chest, avoiding eye contact, changes in the way i speak, address people, acknowledge people, changes in the way i act. i feel incapable of stopping my reactions, so saying i’m fine seems a bit pointless. but i say it, and every time i hope it just disappears, but it doesn’t. physically, it feels like my head is vibrating. all the painful things just bouncing from side to side against my skull. when i shut my eyes, i visualise nothing. there is nothing but black. when i focus on what i can hear, there is a loud buzzing noise, with the world continuing quietly in the background. people who are close to me and addressing me directly feel and sound miles away. 

dissociation. what feels like the mental equivalent of running away. i disappear. the previous strong, painful emotions seem to numb. exactly the same as when you take some paracetamol for a headache and you have the few minutes of it getting better but not feeling quite right? that’s it. bpd is the headache, and dissociation is the painkiller. 

but here is the problem. now, i feel nothing. it happens most times. i start to feel a lot, so i guess my mind attempts to protect itself by removing anything that might evoke emotion. if this really was just a headache, that wouldn’t be an issue. but this isn’t, this is a huge cancerous tumour that is swelling my the second. so the painkiller can only numb it for so long. i wish i could capitalise on it. make the most of the numbness, somehow use it to avoid an escalation. i just can’t. it’s like i’m not there, the people around me aren’t there, i hear that people are speaking but i can’t process it, i often can’t respond or have limited, child-like speech. i can’t move, and become dehydrated quickly. i don’t like to be touched or comforted. while writing this, i realise that if i could accept affection while in this state, it may make a positive difference to how i am when i float back down to earth. 

while writing this i have also realised, that upon the many discoveries i have made in my quest to understand my mental abnormalities, that i have never known what causes the dissociation period to end. i realise now that i have little memory of what happens during those times. maybe i don’t like being touched because it begins the reintroduction into reality? maybe that’s why i can’t speak. am i in some sort of paralytic dream-like state? i am certain of one thing, the paralysis is different depending on the emotion i’m withholding. 

but for whatever reason, it always does end. there always gets to a point where there’s not a force capable of holding it - whatever it is - back from rearing it’s ugly head. my anger, my sadness, my euphoria, they are powerful. you can almost see, and smell and taste it. as it’s been the most frequent of late, we will discuss the anger. you can sense the eruption in every way. time to walk on eggshells. a friend of mine once said that ‘there are a million ways to get it wrong, and only one to get it right’. that is something that weighs the heaviest to me. how helpless must you feel to be someone trying to make another feel more grounded, to find that you can’t. if you’re lucky enough to find something that works, don’t relax just yet because it won’t every time. 

and then the cycle of hurt continues. and i don’t remember always the specifics, i just remember how that person has made me feel before. any time they’ve ever got it wrong, it comes flooding in at once and it’s just so unbearable, so consuming. i can’t sleep it off, i shut my eyes and all i see is cars crashing. i don’t really know where this comes from but i suppose it’s just another, more simple way of visualising a disaster i feel is out of my control. there is nothing but pain, there are no positive thoughts i can use to try and replace the negative ones. 

it is exhausting. whatever the emotion is, it’s the same cycle. i feel all the anger, or all the sad, or all the happiness. i martyr the people i love and then kick the ladder from under their feet and watch them plummet and become someone i have demonised. it all goes back to the same issue. to me, someone can only be good or bad. a person that causes pain or relieves it. there’s no middle ground, there’s no chance of being a good person that makes mistakes. just good or bad. 

the emotional manipulation is heavy. it’s difficult to prevent, because i feel so strongly one way or the other. i’m so afraid of being alone, losing someone i love. the first sign of abandonment, i will feel so adamant that my life is better without them. leave, if that’s what you want. leave, i want you to. i never wanted you. you have ruined me. the way i feel is because of the things you do. i become so abusive, so defensive. and what follows that is sheer desperation at the thought of losing the person i told to leave. i think any one who has ever loved me, has felt trapped. it’s not okay, it’s never been okay i know that but i just don’t know how to stop. i can’t imagine how it feels for someone being with me in these states. like if you leave, you live with the consequences of me not being able to cope. just like everything else, the desperation and panic controls me. i’m pretty likely to cause physical harm to myself, overdose, drive in conditions i shouldn’t be driving in.

and then i apologise. i beg for forgiveness. i promise things will be different and that i can change. i so desperately want them to. i feel like i can’t breathe until i am loved again. i try so hard to stay calm and not react to things, not to make someone feel so awful about themselves about something so minor. something i know myself won’t matter in hours to come. why is the force that takes over me so strong that i can’t prevent a reaction? anyway, this lasts for a couple of days, generally. vary rarely more than a week. all the things that piss me off during an angry cycle seem to not affect me. the person is martyred again. they can do no wrong. 

so i love big, and i love strong and i love so much that it tempts people in. i know it can make others feel amazing about themselves, having someone that hangs on your every word, someone that is 100% interested in every move you make, every word you say. someone who validates you constantly. doesn’t stop letting you know the positive impact you’ve made on their life. someone that genuinely puts your life ahead of their own. will cancel their plans and put yours first. it’s easy to fall into the trap. it is nice, and not all that common to be loved to the extent that i mean. it can make the awful bits, the manipulative bits, seem worth it. it seems like it’s an easy thing to do, walk away from manipulation. it’s not so easy to walk away from this side of it though. 

my perception of the people i love the most changes constantly and rapidly. i no longer know what is real or what is imagined. i no longer know who to trust and who to avoid. i don’t know who to cut from my life, and who to keep. i feel like i’m losing my mind a bit more each day, my grasp on reality has faded and all my lines are so blurred. i don’t know where my boundaries are, or who is crossing them and when. i don’t know what is forgiveness and what is a desperate desire to not be alone. i don’t know what it is to love separately from what it is to need. i don’t know what thoughts or feelings of mine are genuine any more. 

this is, believe it or not, a short version of what it’s like being in a relationship with someone who has an untreated mental illness. it’s harder than you could imagine. add some lovely fresh trauma to that, and you’ve got yourself a permanent rollercoaster of emotion that will, probably, be difficult to sever your ties with. i don’t ever want the people i love to feel trapped. i am sorry for what some people have endured, and i’m sorry for the neglect i’ve placed on others. 


day 2. 

i write this cautiously. i feel so different to how i felt yesterday. so numb. the lines that draw my boundaries are more blurred than ever, today. i feel like a different person, living through the same situation but with a different outlook. i feel more objective. like i’m looking at the situation from more angles than just my own. 

i thought about what i wrote yesterday. i still believe a lot of it is true, but i think i was more justified in my reactions than i wanted to give myself credit for. the person who i love the most hurt me time and time again. he gave little consideration as to how you fix a mistake, a mistake like cheating on me with your ex, the mother of your child, someone who will remain in our lives forever. did he give any real consideration at all in how you work to fix that? 

or did he keep lying, day after day? or did he lie sometimes and other times let his own resentment for how hard he had to work to try and fix things take things take leadership, so like telling the truth but not caring enough to really convince me? there have been lies. there have been lies about who he is speaking to, there have been hidden social media accounts that he kept me blocked on. there have been conversations with the woman in question in which he lied multiple times, about them ever taking place and their content - about how he misses her. there have been lies about what he is really thinking?

now that last one can’t be proved, but with a years worth of other lies, am i really that crazy for thinking it might be? how 5 days ago he told me we would face anything together, and moments later told me there is no hope. he can’t help how he feels. i’m so angry, i am so fucking hurt. is it a lie or did he just feel that differently that quickly? was he maybe even lying to himself?

regardless, i begged. i promised myself i wouldn’t, but i did. i asked if there would ever still be hope for me to prove i can change and make him happy again. he said ‘always’. i told him everything that has changed for me. what i’m going to do to be better. what changes i have made to improve myself and be someone capable of accepting love again. i told him why it is different now, and what made me complacent before. i think i meant it all. i really do think things can change. therapy starts for me on 20th, i have new medication (again), the lockdown in the uk eases on 12th. there are more opportunities for me to try something different than there has been since we started dating. 

he was interested. he said he would come round to talk. i was ready. i felt 100% like it was the right decision, to keep trying. i love him and my life without him seems so directionless and empty. i was planning what to say, how to make him turn my 1% chance into a possibility, and then into a probability, and then a reality. i was brimming with excitement. i felt hope again. 

i shouldn’t have begged, i know. the trouble with using emotional manipulation is it tends to get you what you need to stop the pain. sometimes, when i’m in extreme emotional suffering, which is unfortunately more common for me than some other people, once again, due to the splitting and only ever seeing good or bad, i have imagined physical pains. i clench my jaw so tightly that it starts to feel like my teeth are falling out, my whole face is on fire and i can’t stop clutching at my jaw and applying pressure desperately trying to relieve it. again, it’s all pretty fucked up. often, the pain doesn’t exist. i have many pain killers to hand, after jumping 45ft to escape a potential murderer and confirmed rapist, and a car crash. i am stacking. i take codeine, naproxen, tramadol. even morphine. the pain is relentless, it doesn’t stop. i take handfuls. it does not stop. but take away whatever is causing anxiety, whether it’s ending an argument or taking valium or being admitted to hospital and replacing the anxiety with something new. it goes. and i’m just left uncomfortably numb. 

i am ashamed to admit, that the physical and the emotional distress causes me to use manipulation tactics to feel better. i avoid it at all costs but just like the rest of it, i really just can’t stop sometimes. if i’m given a window, i will use it. so i begged. he texted me saying he was sad and lost, and when i said i was too, he asked if i wanted to see him. i have asked him to stop texting. i have told him if you give me anything to hang on to, i will use it. he continued to text me. asking where i am, if i got home okay etc. 

i tried. i tried the sensible option of saying no, because it will hurt more when he leaves but i couldn’t stop thinking. there is always hope - for as long as he cares how i feel, there must be. so i asked what i asked about, you know if the window is still open for me and like i said, i was all excited and then it left. i’m not joking, i could feel it leave my body like going from hot to cold in just a second. emotional chilblains. he said not to start thinking in a week it would all be forgotten about and we would be back to normal. 

i switched. i wondered how he would have the audacity to warn me. i thought about every time he has hurt me. i previously said that sometimes i feel the blanket, the reminder of hurt, not what it was specifically that happened. today wasn’t that. today the specific details came back. every time he has ever lied. every time he put his feelings ahead of mine. every time he promised me the world and never delivered. i remembered it all. i remembered feeling it, hearing it. i remember seeing his face as he has to explain why he chose to lie. i could feel my heart racing again, like it did at the time. i could feel the cold. for some reason, in certain anxiety-inducing situations, i find i feel cold rather than hot - like i said before, i can feel the heat leave my body.  i felt that. every time i shut my eyes, this time i could see him and i sitting in my car. i picked i different lie each time and relived each experience like it was happening again. the songs i was listening to. me begging for the truth. sitting side by side, not looking in each others eyes, me driving aimlessly hundreds of miles, begging begging begging. his face, i think about it, i think about the look he gets when he’s been caught out again and god, why did i ever bother? why would i care so much about someone who done so much damage?

now here’s the bit that’s interesting. i felt all of that. he texted me saying he ‘believes that i can be different but needs to see it’ and ‘not to expect us to be back together in a week’ at 12.58. i replied saying i need some resolutions from you too, and that i don’t want things back to normal without change considering he’s hurt me periodically for a year at 13.01. i texted him saying i don’t want him to come round, i am not trying any more, i don’t know why i ever thought i would, told him to stop texting me and fucking with my head etc - i texted this at 13.02. 

in 3-4 minutes, i relived a year of lies. i relived every time he promised he would be there and let me down. every time i cried myself to sleep and he wasn’t there. every time he lost his shit at me without reason. i didn’t just remember it. i relived it. every smell, every taste. like i was there. 

in 4 minutes. in 4 minutes i went from feeling like my life wasn’t worth living without him, and cutting my legs with broken shards of glass, emptying pills into a glass and drinking vodka at 10am, to thinking the only life not worth living, is the one i share with him. in 4 minutes i went from wanting to try anything to save us, to wanting to hear him say he was wrong for how he treated me too - enough that it took over anything else that was important. 

it’s been about 2 hours, and i feel nothing. i feel indifferent. even as i type, he doesn’t cross my mind. i can’t visualise his face, or his voice. i can’t imagine the comfort of his arms around my shoulders and pulling me in. i’m typing it, but i can’t feel it any more. i don’t feel sad, or happy, nor angry. i feel as though i am a passenger. i don’t feel hot or cold. the tv is on, but i can’t concentrate on it. i’ve watched the last episode of behind her eyes 4 times this morning. it’s like i’m phasing in and out of consciousness. 

i feel nothing. and i think one thing, over and over again. am i going crazy? am i wrong for expecting allowances for my behaviour on the basis that not only can i not help it, but unavoidable and extreme trauma towards someone you love should create some sort of shield? that i can have an exceptionally bad day without extreme consequence. like i can snap and he understands and comforts rather than being anger. he used to, and we were so happy. he handled it in such a moving way, so gracious and so strong. he wouldn’t let me walk over him, but had some leniency before retaliation. 

am i crazy? is it wrong to expect that? i never did, but he told me he would make things better for me and to trust him and to date him. i don’t hold any resentment there today, i understand how someone could feel like they can save you when they don’t understand the extent of the damage. on another day, i hate him with every molecule for not listening to me and being so naive. on other days, i love him more, for knowing how hard it would be and still having that faith and wanting to try regardless. 

i was wrong when i said that all my lines are blurred. there is only one today. the line of human decency, the power of love and what to expect from people. i don’t know if i’m wrong to think he could’ve handled it 1000 times better on 1000 different occasions.

i am certain of one thing today. i will not text him. i will not say i was wrong to say i won’t try. i will not apologise. i will, however, shower, and do my hair and put on some make up, and stay awake and sober-ish. just in case he surprises me, comes bursting through my door saying he will try as hard as i want to. just in case. 

day 3. 

today is a hateful day. today is one of the ones where i am a good person, and he is a bad person. today is the opposite of day 1. i guess day 2 was my dissociation period. everything hurts so much today. it’s like how yesterday started, but without the relieving numbness after it. it’s actually the evening of the same day, but it feels like i’ve been in pain for weeks and months, not literally a couple of hours. 

i wrote him a letter. i’m not going to send it, but i couldn’t articulate how i was feeling without addressing him directly. so i will use that letter in place of me talking through my feelings. 

‘one last thing i will say for you to think about. realise that i cannot truly forgive, if i do not understand. i have told you why i can’t bring it (the cheating and other lies) up in a calm way, and i hope that, overall, i’ve created a relationship where you feel comfortable being honest with me and telling me the whole truth, and talking about it long enough that you might understand it better yourself shouldn’t be the most terrifying thing? 

i’ve told you it is what i need. transparency is the most expected thing to want after being cheated on, yet on and off for different reasons you make it seem like it’s such a difficult task for you, or like you’re always fucking it up. it’s not that difficult, and your responses to the times i have something to bring up, increasingly make the situation worse and put me in a position where i don’t feel comfortable any more, so now i’m defensive. we can’t have a conversation about anything real, because from the moment you cunt off, we are just battling against each other being defensive and then apologetic. these times, and absolutely no other times but the times where it seems like you’ve lied or deceived or avoided the truth - if you want things to work, you have to learn to put your feelings to the side to hear what i’m saying before it escalates to something bigger - like me just thinking you’re nasty or you don’t want me because i’m useless and i don’t try or i’m wrong to feel how i feel or i should’ve gotten over it by now. you take away the part of me, that no matter how angry, would always still explain why i feel how i feel, and you would understand better and not feel as angry!! you make me close up. i have never and will never expect you to not react when it’s not directly related to you cheating on me and it being something i’ve told you i need your help to heal from. anything else, react as you want - it won’t go as terribly as you think. 

so that place i create for you, and you might not feel it much any more, but the one where you can tell me anything and i will listen. the times immediately after where i would let you talk and not get mad - they come back if one: you use them to benefit our relationship in some way and two: if you give me those same spaces when i need them, even at the expense of how you feel. i did that for you - i let myself hurt so i could be someone you spoke to about what you done. you were that person for me once. you are not any more. 

you start a conversation with me about it. you tell me how sick you feel at what you done and how you wonder if you could ever forgive yourself. you remind yourself it’s the worst thing you’ve done and to someone that had only ever loved you. and then you talk to me. and i talk back, and i get the answers that i want. ‘it just happened’ isn’t good enough, neither is self sabotage or you were reminded of the way things used to be. i don’t give a fuck if you want to get over it, you get over it with me by helping me. i deserve that from you. i want the loose ends tied, i want specifics. i want you to fucking hear me when i say that your honesty about what happened and why, will never hurt more than every time i am reminded that there is more to this that i am yet to learn. it is a safe place. i want to know. i beg you time and time again. i want you to feel how i feel just for a day, and use it to help us. help me trust you won’t do it again. help me believe your version by telling me how you felt, and not just what you done. i can’t bring this up, because you act like this. you get defensive. you know i still don’t trust you, you know i still struggle most days with what happened - but i need you to be ready, on your terms, and want to talk to me and finally help me heal. 

but you don’t.

i’ve come to realise that when i’m not dealing with the trauma you put me through, i can be an amazing person. i can be kind, considerate, empathetic, loving, loyal, unwavering. increasingly, i am none of those things when i am with you and i don’t want to lose sight of the person i worked hard to be. i will not let you, my dad, my rapist, or anyone else that has caused me years worth of psychological damage be the same people that cause me to lose my character and who i am as a person. you took my trust, and that is all you will take. i will not give you the release of knowing that i caused this by staying with you, as much as you caused it with your actions. 

just know that i have tried. you tell me every time i have an issue with your lack of transparency that you feel i don’t try at all. but i try every day to word things a little kinder, to not act like every issue is the end of our relationship. i try to give you space to explain before i accuse. i try every day by cuddling you to sleep and by waking up with you each morning. i try, when i say i love you even on the days i don’t think you deserve to hear it. i try every time there is someone that has been as loyal to me as i have them, that i let down to spend time reconciling with you. 

i do not deserve to have my feelings ridiculed and put down. you created a victim, so you allow that victim the space they need to heal at your own expense or you walk away. you do not, and unfortunately, for a long time will not have the same right to anger that i have. i recognise that you’re a human being with reactions, regardless of the past - but it is your responsibility to manage those reactions in a way that lets me feel openly about what you done and what you continue to do when you deceive. 

you have put too much attention on trying to make our days perfect and argument-free rather than real. you work on today rather than the future. you live in some sort of fear of being reminded about what you done, and somehow expect me to absorb that, alone, every day. 

you chose to date a girl that had been brutally raped and kidnapped just a couple of months before dating you. whose parents explosive separation caused her to have no contact with either of them. who had been wrestling with loneliness and mental health disorders. i don’t expect you to understand how to manage that without my help - but i expected you to stay faithful. 

you can downplay it as much as you want, and you can say i’m using it as an excuse, but does it really matter? the reality is, you sat in a police interview room with me, as the one person i was allowed to bring with me due to covid-19. you held my hand and cried with me as you watched a monster get sentenced to over 20 years in prison. you heard every second of what i endured that day - what he said to me, what he done to me and sat with me knowing there was more endurance to come. that 3 days before you sat in that room with me, you made a decision to be unfaithful. you heard me say in my witness impact statement that i don’t know how i will ever trust someone again. it’s not an excuse, it is a fact.  

i can’t continue to try while you sit there blaming the victim you helped create.’

what i want to say, or rather scream in his face before melting to the floor, is how dare he? how dare he let me fall in love with him, put me through this and then leave me? he should be begging, not me. he should be the one who feels like they’ve lost someone who made their life great - not me. as i write this, the self resentment is closing in so i can’t really say it with as much conviction as i would’ve done an hour ago. 

maybe we are both just awful. maybe we just weren’t right. maybe i am a little bit crazy, or completely fucked up. maybe he is a bit of a dickhead and maybe he could’ve been better. maybe i’ve been gaslit for months and that has fucked my perception on reality. that’s what my friends say, my colleagues, people that know us both. they say he was wrong to treat me how he did, and i have nothing to feel this crippling self loathing for. maybe i’ve gaslit them into thinking that. 

my head feels like ants. like white noise. like tens of millions of these little dots and lines just vibrating around between my eyes. 

i have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder for 12 years. i have ptsd. i have tried lithium, venlafaxine, sodium volproate, citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, mirtazapine and quetiapine, that i can remember. many more from years ago, but these are the ones most recently. i haven’t found one effective enough to keep me out of hospital and safe. i certainly have not found anything that balances my mood. they are good for different things, some have helped me get to sleep, stay asleep, some have given me a head start on happiness in the mornings, some have turned the buzzing noise down on some of the days. 

i have had talking therapy. mainly for ptsd. i have learned about grounding techniques, but nothing that has helped in my relationship. i have seen 7 different therapists/psychiatrists in the last 14 months. i have been firm in what i need, and that is not trauma focused therapy but dbt. the more recent psychiatrists have agreed, and the ball is rolling, i have my first session with a ‘specialist’ on 20th april and i refuse to stop telling people what i need until i get it. i am grateful to have health professionals on my side, after many years of them working against me. 

dbt is hard to find. not all therapists offer it and it is expensive. you need individual sessions and group sessions to the tune of around £125 a week. it’s made more difficult by being only phone or zoom based now. i know i have slightly different ways of projecting myself based on the medium, so i hope for face to face sessions to resume soon. i have looked into rehabs. i would say that what i experience is not much different to an addiction. rather than taking something i know is bad in the long run, i say something. i guess it’s all to do with feeling a lack of control over my actions. rehab will be my next step. this will cost £3000 for 3 months, with 12 months of follow ups.


thank you everyone that took the time to read this. i am not looking for your opinions on my relationship. i just needed to vent. i thought it may even help someone. maybe someone reading this feels the same buzzing i do, and this might help them recognise it. maybe it’s your partner, and reading this helps you to identify the issues and work with them to get better. it helps me to write, and to

I'm convinced I have Quiet BPD.,"hey everyone, i just wanted to grab some insight on my first psychiatrist appointment i had last week.

first of all, i haven’t been diagnosed with bpd. a few months ago i had to stop working because i had a plan to end my life and was really scared so i went home to live with my parents for a while. at the time i was seeing my therapist every other week and we had been working on emdr therapy for some past trauma that seems to make me feel like a burden constantly and others about low self-image. i told her perviously that i was afraid that i might have a personality disorder but i was scared to ask her if she thought i did. my best friend and roommate at the time has been diagnosed with bpd and after having long conversations about our experiences, our emotions and trauma she was also convinced i had bpd. my emotions are always all over the place and i become obsessive over someone and feel extremely dejected and suicidal when they don’t seem to care about me as much as i do, and for the first time in my life i felt like someone understood what i was saying and how i felt. after being home for a while, i talked with my doctor who put me on zoloft (i have been on lexapro in the past, but i hated it and it just made me feel numb.) she screened me with lots of questions and also asked if i had heard of bpd, to which i answered yes. she told me that i could have bpd or bipolar and referred me to a psychiatrist. at the same time, i was seeing my therapist weekly and was feeling extremely depressed, was self harming more than i ever have before and also excessively drinking in my room without my family noticing. i was practicing sh and drinking to punish myself, feel something or distract myself from suicidal thoughts. i told my therapist that my doctor had suggested that i may have bpd or bipolar and she said that maybe we should try some dbt in order to help me control some of my unhealthy urges, which has greatly helped these past few months. before my psychiatrist appointment last week, my therapist and i made a list of everything i wanted to mention to him and what my fears were going to the appointment. my therapist also told me to tell him first and foremost that i tend to downplay what i am going through a lot. i constantly do this during therapy sessions and i always think i am being dramatic and over exaggerating everything even when i tell her i am suicidal every day and that nothing matters, i just think i am faking it. we wrote down how i constantly have black and white thinking, constantly feeling guilt and feeling like a burden, impulsivity (sh, drinking), constantly pushing my friends and family (relationships) away. we also added how i want to be less suicidal and feel better about myself and want to be able to enjoy life without feeling like a burden to everyone. i was really afraid to go since i have a larger fear with men and i have a bigger fear that they think i’m being dramatic.

my appointment was less than eventful. i was in and out within fifteen minutes, i had printed off the sheet my therapist and i made about the troubles i wanted to mention to him, and told him that i tend to downplay what i am going though and how i think i am faking everything and the feelings i am actually experiencing. he read it over and asked me if i have abandonment issues, which to that i said yes, he asked how old i am and then asked if i have impulsive behaviours, like if i had ever got an impulsive tattoo or piercing to which i said not particularly. he then asked me if i had ever self harmed (which was on the sheet) and then he asked to see them which i was reluctant to show him but showed him the ones on my wrist although most of them are healed because i’ve been working so hard with my therapist these last few months in order to control my urges. he asked me if my emotions are hard to control to which i responded yes, told him how i get really big highs which i enjoy but are followed by lows which i have realized from my therapy sessions and have been working on skills in order to keep my highs more stable. he prescribed me abilify (a mood stabilizer) and asked if i had any other questions to which i asked if he thinks i have any sort of disorder or any symptoms of one which he responded no to, said that i may have some emotional regulation problems but the medication should help with that. again, i was in and out within fifteen minutes. i cried in my car for two hours after the appointment.

my parents said that it’s good that i don’t have a “disorder”, however am i wrong for being frustrated? i spoke with my therapist about it already and she did make a good point that fifteen minutes isn’t a long enough time to understand someone. i’m just so frustrated because i feel like i’ve done so much research and i am seriously convinced i have quiet borderline, but at the same time i feel like i’m being dramatic and faking it all the time. i don’t want to go on a mood stabilizer just for it not to work because he doesn’t have enough information to be able to medicate or diagnose me properly. i’m so frustrated as i waited over three months for this appointment too. i'm also off work right now and on disability so it's frustrating that i have to go back to work soon and i still feel terrible. i feel like my psychiatrist just tried to diagnose me for “typical” bpd traits. it’s so frustrating and i’ve never been more confused. does anyone have any advice and/or insight onto what i’m going through right now? am i wrong for being frustrated and disappointed?sorry i know this is long. sorry if this doesn’t make sense. anyways if you read all this i seriously appreciate you and thank you.

**tl;dr i haven’t been diagnosed with bpd but i am convinced i have quiet borderline. my therapist and my gp seem to think so as well. i have been in therapy for over five years and three with the same therapist and have been doing dbt with her for a few months now and it is extremely helpful for coping with harmful urges. my visit with my psychiatrist was extremely short and didn’t seem to think there was much wrong other than “emotional instability” and put me on abilify. am i wrong for being frustrated and disappointed?**",1620762338,True,BPD,2021-05-11 19:45:38,"I'm convinced I have Quiet BPD. hey everyone, i just wanted to grab some insight on my first psychiatrist appointment i had last week.

**tl;dr i haven’t been diagnosed with bpd but i am convinced i have quiet borderline. my therapist and my gp seem to think so as well. i have been in therapy for over five years and three with the same therapist and have been doing dbt with her for a few months now and it is extremely helpful for coping with harmful urges. my visit with my psychiatrist was extremely short and didn’t seem to think there was much wrong other than “emotional instability” and put me on abilify. am i wrong for being frustrated and disappointed?**",convinced quiet bpd hey everyone wanted grab insight first psychiatrist appointment last week first haven’t diagnosed bpd month ago stop working plan end life really scared went home live parent time seeing therapist every week working emdr therapy past trauma seems make feel like burden constantly others low selfimage told perviously afraid might personality disorder scared ask thought best friend roommate time diagnosed bpd long conversation experience emotion trauma also convinced bpd emotion always place become obsessive someone feel extremely dejected suicidal don’t seem care much first time life felt like someone understood saying felt home talked doctor put zoloft lexapro past hated made feel numb screened lot question also asked heard bpd answered yes told could bpd bipolar referred psychiatrist time seeing therapist weekly feeling extremely depressed self harming ever also excessively drinking room without family noticing practicing sh drinking punish feel something distract suicidal thought told therapist doctor suggested may bpd bipolar said maybe try dbt order help control unhealthy urge greatly helped past month psychiatrist appointment last week therapist made list everything wanted mention fear going appointment therapist also told tell first foremost tend downplay going lot constantly therapy session always think dramatic exaggerating everything even tell suicidal every day nothing matter think faking wrote constantly black white thinking constantly feeling guilt feeling like burden impulsivity sh drinking constantly pushing friend family relationship away also added want le suicidal feel better want able enjoy life without feeling like burden everyone really afraid go since larger fear men bigger fear think i’m dramatic appointment le eventful within fifteen minute printed sheet therapist made trouble wanted mention told tend downplay going though think faking everything feeling actually experiencing read asked abandonment issue said yes asked old asked impulsive behaviour like ever got impulsive tattoo piercing said particularly asked ever self harmed sheet asked see reluctant show showed one wrist although healed i’ve working hard therapist last month order control urge asked emotion hard control responded yes told get really big high enjoy followed low realized therapy session working skill order keep high stable prescribed abilify mood stabilizer asked question asked think sort disorder symptom one responded said may emotional regulation problem medication help within fifteen minute cried car two hour appointment parent said it’s good don’t “disorder” however wrong frustrated spoke therapist already make good point fifteen minute isn’t long enough time understand someone i’m frustrated feel like i’ve done much research seriously convinced quiet borderline time feel like i’m dramatic faking time don’t want go mood stabilizer work doesn’t enough information able medicate diagnose properly i’m frustrated waited three month appointment im also work right disability frustrating go back work soon still feel terrible feel like psychiatrist tried diagnose “typical” bpd trait it’s frustrating i’ve never confused anyone advice andor insight onto i’m going right wrong frustrated disappointedsorry know long sorry doesn’t make sense anyways read seriously appreciate thank tldr haven’t diagnosed bpd convinced quiet borderline therapist gp seem think well therapy five year three therapist dbt month extremely helpful coping harmful urge visit psychiatrist extremely short didn’t seem think much wrong “emotional instability” put abilify wrong frustrated disappointed,0.9952402086328684,"['Aripiprazole', 'Escitalopram', 'Sertraline']","```json

What medications work for you?,"i know this question is commonly asked on this sub, but i’d like to share my experiences with medications and i want to know what others recommend.

i’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for as long as i can remember. i got diagnosed and i started taking zoloft. zoloft made me feel like a zombie, so i was switched to wellbutrin. wellbutrin really helped improve my base mood, but i broke out in horrible hives a few weeks after starting it. after that i started prozac, but it gave me terrible insomnia and actually worsened my depression. soon after, i was diagnosed with ocd and bpd and my psychiatrist suggested lexapro. i’ve been taking it for about a month now, and i believe it helps a lot with my general feeling of optimism, but over this past month i have been very depressed. occasionally to the point where i can’t do anything. i’m seeing my psychiatrist again next week and i’m not sure if i should ask to up my dosage. switch to something else, or add another medication to the lexapro. i will also be starting therapy this month.

Friendly reminder that psychiatrists can be assholes,"some of the shittiest, most narcissistic people i’ver ever met have worked in the mental health field. if you are ever seeking treatment and someone isn’t treating you right or things just seem off, it’s not your fault. they might try to make you think it is since you’re the one seeking mental health treatment, but really, the psych workers are the ones who have undiagnosed mental health issues and just want to take it out on others.

and if you are taking pills that don’t make you feel good, you absolutely have the right to say you don’t like them for any reason.

Medication problem,"okay so i got diagnosed more than two month ago and i’ve been on sertraline (50mg) for almost two month. the first two weeks was hell ( i wasn’t able to go outside because i had a severe panic attack ) but after it seemed like it’s working well. after a month, i started having soreness on my leg whenever i try to sleep and get up in the morning. it was really hard to fall asleep because of the discomfort i had. i called my doctor and he said maybe i should stop taking sertraline. i used to sleep 12-14 hours daily basis before taking sertraline, but after i had a regulated sleeping schedule. but when i stopped taking sertraline, i couldn’t sleep anymore. it’s either i wake up around 4 or 4 or 5 in the morning and try to go back to sleep around 8 or i go to bed around 3 and wake up at 8. i lost 10 pounds since i’m on sertraline ( i lost my appetite), but now i’ve gained weight because first of all, i’m feeling tired and when i feel tired i eat a lot and second of all, i can’t stop eating for no reason. i’m keep craving something. i’ve also been more active ever since i’m off sertraline but i feel really lost and i really don’t know who i am.

i’m going to see the doctor tomorrow, but i really don’t know what to say. it sucks and i hate everything. i wanna die. but at the same time i feel super excited and happy about my life. i feel like i can do everything and i try to go out more and speak to people i haven’t spoken to in awhile.

i feel like i’m going crazy, my dosage wasn’t even high so i feel like i’m super exaggerating. i don’t know what kinda medication should i take or suggest to the doctor (i have a gad as well and i think sertraline didn’t help with anxiety). idk i need any advices right now.

sorry for my bad english, i’m not a native english speaker. also, i’m a bit drunk now, i’m feeling a bit dizzy. i kinda wanna keep drinking because it makes me happy.

i have had some success with cocktailing medicines. the most useful medicines for me are quetiapine (seroquel®), 150 mg and lamotrigine (lamictal®), 200 mg. i have in the past also used diazepam (valium®), 5 mg as a rescue therapy for debilitating anxiety.

while i had success with sertraline (zoloft®), 200 mg for the relief of depression and anxiety, i have been asked to switch to vortioxetine (trintellix®/brintellix®), 10 mg for the same symptoms. from what i read online, it has a similar review profile as quetiapine: if it works it’s great, but it doesn’t always work, and when it doesn’t, it’s awful.

Abilify for BPD/bipolar 2,"hey guys,

im bipolar 2 with bpd features, and i'm really struggling. i'm on lamictal and zoloft, which i believe has helped, but my doctor would like me to cut the zoloft and try 2mg of abilify as a supplement for the lamictal.

Haloperidol. Any experiences? URGENT,"i [26f] have been dealing with bpd for 9 years and i have taken all kinds of meds to treat it.

i'm not doing good with sertraline (100mg) it made me photobic and gave me blurred vision. i'm always angry and tired because my arms are always hurting and are numb therefore my hands are always shaky, to the point i cannot even use a pen.

now my sister who never speaks to me just entered my room saying 'i'm coming in peace to tell you the doctors agreed to put you on haloperidol in secret because they're going to decreased the sertraline to 50mg, because your actual meds are not helping you and you're very agressive. so, please, give it a try and if it doesn't work, we just stop '.

it's an oral solution, (in drops) that has to be dissolved on a glass of water and is also tasteless.

How crazy a day can be when you have BPD!,"so i woke up this morning having had about five hours sleep, at about 8.30am, and i figured i may as well just try and get up and be a normal productive human. i should have been at work but my psychiatrist signed me off from work for two weeks, because i have been withdrawing from effexor/venlafaxine, which any of you who have done will know is absolute hell, so in all honesty the last two weeks haven't been easy in any case.

so i pulled myself together and headed outside with pokemon go to hand - caught myself a few pidgeys, went to the bank, came back home and cooked some breakfast. it was around then that i realised just how awful i was feeling. my psych prescribed me pregabalin to help with the venlafaxine withdrawal symptoms, so i took a few of those but it didn't help. i started to break down big time, suddenly convinced i was the worst person in the universe, that i was disgusting and i should just go and die.

i'm home alone for a week because the people i live with are on holiday, so i lost my shit big time, i was screeching like a banshee as i tore apart my room to find the razors my sane half had tried to hide from my mad destructive half. i found them and tore a few gashes into my arm, and even that didn't seem to help as much as usual.

so i called my mental health team and asked to speak to the duty worker, who was nice enough but just kept saying i need to start taking citalopram, which a) i can't because i've been taking 5-htp supplement to help with my withdrawals, and b) takes bloody forever to work anyway so frankly the advice was not helpful. anyway the duty worker was a super nice guy and i told him i couldn't come over to pick up the citalopram script because i was losing my mind, so he brought it to my house and i cried and thanked him.

then i was alone again.

the day passed in a series of convulsions - for a while i would be utterly consumed by the darkness inside of myself, howling and wailing up to the gods for any form of respite. then respite would come, brief, perfect and i would attempt to savour it, only for the beast inside my stomach to rear its head again. i ordered too much pizza and ate it to try and quiet myself. i called a private therapist and arranged a free assessment session for next week because i was so desperate to find someone, anyone to talk to who might understand how much awful all-consuming pain i am in.

at around 5.30pm i got scared that i was genuinely suicidal - i sort of came to from a chance to find myself sitting with a claw hammer, tapping it gently, menacingly against the back of my hand. i called papyrus which is a uk youth suicide prevention helpline, and they told me to call the crisis team, so at the crest of the wave of my impending crisis, i did.

""hello?"" said the voice on the line.

""hello,"" i said. ""the mental health team gave me this number and i am in desperate need of help so i thought i would call.""

the lady sounded uninterested at best. she asked for my name, which i gave, and then told me that i was not referred to the crisis team, and if i wanted to be referred then my best bet was to go and present myself to a&amp;e in my current crisis so they would refer me. i asked her why on earth my mental health team would have given me the number if i wasn't referred to the team.

""i don't know,"" the woman said blithely, as though it didn't matter, as though it wasn't important, as though it wasn't a matter of life or death.

i cut myself again after that, writhing on the floor, gasping for air into my lungs only to expel it in the same heartbeat. i cut and i cut and again it didn't help. by this point i was really panicking about what i might do, gathering all sorts of old pills i could find in my drawers into a little crow's treasure nest in my bed - sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, venlafaxine, ibuprofen, co-codamol, pregabalin, my 5-htp... i bunched them all up in a heap, all my leftover pills, and placed the claw hammer next to them.

then i called samaritans and spoke with an incredible man called gary of all things, who offered me an incredible level of support which, after over an hour on the phone, seemed to somewhat quell the raging demon who had possessed my body unbidden this morning.

now i lie in the sea of my own destruction - my arm torn to bits, my room tossed to bits in the frantic frenzy of razor-searching, leftover pizza from my binge, the hammer sitting randomly on my floor alongside a pack of cheap razors.

Doctor just stopped my Clonazepam without any warning - clinic and doc will not respond! Help!,"so i've been seeing this psychiatrist twice now, and yesterday he put me on risperdal in addition to the zoloft he started last month.

i've been on xanax daily for years, but last year another hack psychiatrist switched me to clonazepam.

yesterday the clinic told me the doctor wasn't there, but i caught him walking around in the back, so i called them out, and i met with him.

when i went to get my meds from wal mart, there were 2 meds missing, the most important being the clon, since it's a benzodiazepine and it could be fatal to stop cold turkey.

i emailed the doc 3 times and called the clinic twice. nothing.

what can i do?? i don't have money for the er and it was super difficult to even get this doc to see me.

if you like watching train wrecks, google ""compass health in boynton beach"" and read the google reviews.

so, i'm 27. i was first diagnosed with bpd and major depression when i was 16, after having 3 surgeries and a mrsa/osteomyelitis infection in my left ankle at age 15, and two broken metatarsals and two surgeries on my right foot at age 16. my mom was trying to prevent me from getting hooked on opiates, so she had my pediatrician prescribe me antidepressants. when i was diagnosed, i was on 300mg wellbutrin xl and 250mg zoloft. i was in constant pain, i ate tylenol and ibuprofen like candy, etc. i grew up in california, and i had friends who smoked weed, so i began smoking weed at 16 as well, to numb everything. when i was 18 i quit all antidepressants, started smoking more often, drinking, and hunting opiates because i was in constant pain. i'm still amazed i escaped that phase of my life in one piece.

anyways. that's a short version of a big part of why i am who/how i am today. i had a few toxic relationships (nothing physical. just narcissistic assholes and verbal abuse and such) and then i met the man who is now my husband (we're not legally married). i moved halfway across the country to be with him, and cut back on smoking when i moved because of the state i moved to - not nearly as common up here, and a much less populated area. i continued to smoke until i got pregnant with our beautiful daughter, and i slowly tapered down and quit smoking while i was pregnant. i smoked a few times since then but i don't enjoy it much anymore. but i used weed as a crutch, a mask, and an avoidance mechanism for my feelings and struggles. now that i haven't been regularly smoking (a total of one joint worth in two years) i am realizing just how fucked up i am mentally. after our daughter was born i got ppd, went back on zoloft, because it never gave me bad side effects and is still working well for me. after our son was born (july of last year), my depression worsened and i began having severe mood swings. i would almost compare it to what i understand bipolar to be like. i got put on lamotrigine (lamictal), started at 25mg twice daily and am now taking 75-100mg twice daily. it does significantly improve my overall control of my mood, but i still struggle sometimes. my home life is up and down, which doesn't help. i usually watch/listen to shit on youtube (currently listen to creepypasta narrations) to keep my mind distracted, but i know that's not the best way to handle things. i have been wanting to start journaling, but i never follow through with it long term. there's a lot that i'm not including in here that is probably somewhat relevant, but my thumbs are getting tired and i don't want to go overboard rambling.

tl;dr: i am just now realizing the full strength of my mental struggles and i don't know how to cope/change my self destructive, negative, procrastination patterns and thought processes. have also been stress/comfort eating a lot of sugar and chocolate, which i know does not help.

she usually tells me she loves me and laughs at my dumb jokes and funny faces when she's on sertraline but off of sertraline she acts as if i completely disgust her and as if she hates me more than she hates anyone else on earth.

thanks in advance.",need help switching med hey ive prozac couple month doesnt really help several breakdown without obvious reason feel tired depressed almost time physical side effect killing grind teeth time wake headache due grinding sleep spend day without eating anything dont feel like want lustral sertraline zoloft wasnt good definitely helped better time mental breakdown didnt mind long dont happen frequently im thinking switching back lustral wanted ask first anyone similar experience prozac tried lustral know something help bpd thanks advance,0.989558038421958,"['Fluoxetine', 'Sertraline']","```json

Anyone else with a dual Bipolar/BPD diagnosis?,"wondering if anyone else has a dual bipolar/bpd diagnosis. i (29f) am seeing a therapist, a psychiatrist and am in a weekly dbt class. i just had a big setback and am feeling very discouraged. i'm on zoloft, wellbutrin and am working on tapering up lamictal (using psychiatrist's directions). she wants me on cymbalta, buspar and lamictal.

i just rage quit yet another job. i am so tired of this endless cycle...feel good, make progress...feel bad, self sabotage, end up in the same place again. i'm using my dbt skills and then all of a sudden i'm raging and everything goes out the window.

I seem to have some BPD traits. Any medication recommendations?,"25 y old female here. i have struggled with social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder all my life, as far back as i can remember. this is accompanied with feelings of sadness/depression and emptiness. in university, i just barely got my assignments in on time. i went to an excellent university and did well in a challenging degree though. sleep schedule was completely a mess and i felt pretty friendless. (insomnia on stressful days leading to late mornings). yes, there were people i tagged along with but i just felt like i didn't connect with them as was a burden. i was called ""needy"" by some but others were nice enough. however, since leaving university i haven't been able to really stay in contact with any of them as i guess i was not that close to them. it was so bad that in university, i pretty much had every meal alone in the dining hall (where everyone goes in groups). since graduating, i have attempted to work and get jobs but i had such bad social/general anxiety that i cannot talk to those i work with or just freak out and have insomnia all the time. getting any meaningful work in these circumstances is not possible.

i have been mainly unemployed since graduating trying various medicines and supplements to get better. what has worked for me so far is omega 3 fish oil and thyroxine 50mcg. these allowed me to really understand how others think (which i was so disconnected from my whole life). they also removed a significant amount of fog in my mind. i am not diagnosed as hypothyroid - my levels are normal except for tsh which is a 5.6 on a scale ending at 4.2. increasing the thyroxine any more gives me anxiety so i think i have reached an appropriate amount with that.

the next phase since the increased clarity has been intense meditation and exercising. these are providing some more headspace to figure out what's going on with my mind. it boils down to this - i have these intense emotions during social situations (usually intense sadness when i think someone doesn't like me or i have said something wrong or i am acting awkward) which just don't ever go away. the day after the stressful situation (say a group meeting for charity volunteers), part of the emotion is still there - either pain or sadness. and while i can get out of bed and eat food and pretend to be normal at home, i can't concentrate on anything - like reading, talking to people. and these leads to more sadness and the cycle continues. i have tried antidepressants such as sertraline, fluoxetine, agolmelatine, bupropion, venlafaxine but they don't help, i am guessing because i don't have major depression. vortioxetine did help but it numbed my out completely and i was very confused about who i was or how i should act (something i struggled with before i was taking it already ; i have identity issues). i have also done a lot of cbt over the past few years and i am kind/generous towards myself but i have this sneaking suspicion that i really need medication for these mood issues. i would love you guys' advice on this.

ps. my psychiatrist is starting me on psychodynamic therapy in a few weeks time.

Experiences with lamictal,"after being on 25 mg for two weeks, i've now been on 50 mg of lamictal for almost two weeks. i'm going to move to 75 mg soon, which (according to my psychiatrist) is when i should start to feel something.

just wanted to know what everyone's experiences were. i've had some pretty terrible experiences with medications in the past. zoloft made me go manic (which is what caused my psychiatrist to realize that i probably have bipolar tendencies). another one which i've had (i cannot remember the name of it -- it had two names, one started with an ""m"" and the other with a ""r"") caused weight gain.

my main worry is any side effects -- particularly weight gain. i've gained the horrid freshmen 15 after starting college. also, i've gone off of my dexedrine (which majorly suppresses appetite) -- which i've been taking since i was eleven years old. it's hard to manage my appetite now that i actually feel hunger.

i've also heard that lamictal can cause lethargy. i've actually been experiencing issues with insomnia (which i'm now taking ambien for, which i hope doesn't cause weight gain as well) and briefly went off of lamictal because i couldn't sleep. what have been the experiences of people that were made more energetic by lamictal? did you still get the whole ""brain fog"" or anything?

at what dosage did you guys start to notice changes? if it helps, i'm 5'3"" and about 121 pounds -- in case my size would have anything to do with what dosage would affect me more (sorry if this is unnecessary information).

I think of ending my life more than 10 times a day.,"my bpd has worsened dramatically. i’m a final year student at uni and i suffer from bpd, social anxiety disorder, depression and adhd(not diagnosed but very likely), dyslexia &amp; learning disorder. i was born into a dysfunctional family as they had a boy who died of an accident before i was born. he drowned at the age of 3, while my father was working as an expat in london. this happened when my mother was busy taking pictures &amp; talking to her friends who came to visit mum from south korea. by the time she had realised that he was disappeared, it was already too late. this happened on my father’s birthday. it was a very traumatic event for my parents and my older sister. 

of course the marriage was very unhappy after that event, i’m sure that both my parents have mental illnesses, especially mum- i think she has bpd too as she was raised by narcissistic and sociopathic mother(my grandmother), who manipulated her and my uncle to move back into her house, even when they were married and have kids in their 40s and 50s. she hates grandmother but lives with her without getting a job to this day.

my father says she was the one who manipulated mum to divorce him, but my sister and i also know that he was having an affair when we were 13 and 5. my sister first discovered the text message from the woman he was seeing and she was traumatised by that again. but she never mentioned it to dad. mum smacked his head when she discovered my sister’s resentful letter to dad- while we were having breakfast in the living room. he swore at her and left the table. i still remember seeing it. i was 5.

there were just never ending family disputes, i saw them arguing and fighting everyday. i never got used to schools and was never able to socialise with kids, my overprotective(most likely caused by my brother’s death) mum suddenly flew to us without telling me and my sister when i was 7. after they got divorced, dad took our custody and i was forced to migrate to england with them. personally i wanted to live with mum but my sister made this decision for me as i was ‘too young’. the first month we arrived, i cried alone every night, in the new, unfamiliar country.

my father had serious issues with women. he completely ignored my opinions on my (ex)stepmother and her kids and got remarried before moving back to london. he said it was all for me and my sister but i knew that he just wanted her. he discovered that she cheated on him with a man she met at church and they always argued. she tried to kill dad and dad beat her up for cheating. 

even after they got divorced again after 2 years marriage, i was mentally abused(threatened, mocked and belittled) by adults like a punchbag(both parents, sister and teachers) and bullied at school for being the only asian kid whose english was poor, sexually assaulted at 12 by mum’s friend in vietnam, beaten up by dad with a golf club for refusing to go to school(a private school which costs £60 pounds a week according to him) and starved &amp; bullied  by (ex)stepmother and her kids, then raped by two men while i was still confused with my sexuality. i identify myself as lesbian. 

as a child, i worked hard at school though because i wanted that attention and love from dad and tutors. but it never got to me. my parents only used my performance at school to brag it to their friends and i was always home alone after school. my sister ran away after the stepmother incident and she lived alone ever since. dad was busy at work &amp; busy seeing women, always came home after i fell asleep but his co-worker(as well as his close friend) who was living with us, took care of me instead, treated me like a friend and father. i liked him because he’d cook for me, watch tv with me and listen to my sorrows. he left &amp; moved back to korea after a year though, apparently he called my mother and told her that he got eventually sick and tired of dad. i was upset that he was gone. 

i have so many problems myself and i know it. i’ve always wanted to break free from dad but i’m always so scared and unsure about myself and my life. i still want love and attention but i’m afraid of being hurt and neglected. i screwed up my a-levels when i discovered that my father got remarried second time to a woman without telling me / my sister. it was a marriage certificate that i discovered on the table and the woman is 24 years younger than him. it brought back all the memories of how i got abused by my (ex)step mother. i fumed and got mentally destroyed with betrayal. my immediate thought was ‘there had been already 3-4 suicide attempts before and is he trying to make me go through all this again?’. i confronted him ‘why didn’t you tell us? aren’t we your daughters?’ instead he replied ‘it’s none of your business’ ‘you have to move out once you’re in university anyway’. this hurt me so much. i kicked him and punched him for the first time ever. he started threatening me financially for ‘hurting’ him and for being ungrateful to a ‘birth parent’. his emotional abuse just never stopped and it is still ongoing to this day.

when i tell mum about problems in daily life, she laughed. she’s gone crazy for sure and i blocked her last month. i tell my sister about what i experienced, she just ignored me. i don’t blame her but i had to live with second stepmum for two months. the thought of her being a gold digger never got away and it was too stressful for me to handle so i moved out too at the age of 17/18. 

i was never happy with life. i’m still not sure what happiness feels like without drugs. everyday feels raw pain to me. i wake up in the morning thinking: ‘why did i wake up, i wished i never woke up’. i’ve been stuck in my room for 4 months now, after i was told my self-esteem is too low by one of university tutors during crit, some students stopped talking to me and started avoiding me. thus i stopped going into university. i’ve been on nhs cbt waiting list for 3 months but as my mental health worsened, they cancelled it &amp; transferred me under mental crisis care. almost everyday, different nurses came in just to check if i’m at risk of committing suicide. as i have social anxiety, this didn’t help at all but made me feel even more hopeless angry. 

i had taken so many different types of antidepressants over the course of 8 years on &amp; off. sertraline, prozac, citalopram, fluoxetine and so on. sertraline worked best for me while i was at 6th form but it doesn’t work for me anymore. i started having seizures since last november after breaking up with my date(who also had unhappy childhood). i think i was the cause but i don’t know what i did wrong. perhaps being too clingy, as she mentioned that i was ‘way too intense’. i feel sceptical about medications and i just want to end my life. i don’t see any hope for the future. i can’t get out because i can’t help thinking negative sides of people and what they could do to harm me. but again, i feel so lonely and isolated. so fucked up. 

i have already made specific plans to end my life. i’m just a mere individual in this world. life will go on even after i’m gone, no big deal. i want to be forgotten. i shouldn’t have been born. nothing i do is good. i want eternal sleep. for myself. i apologise for this long post, i wanted to clear my thought process. life isn’t for everybody... but i hope you all remaining bpd sufferers find happiness and hope in life. i have made my decision.",1552438968,False,BPD,2019-03-13 01:02:48,"I think of ending my life more than 10 times a day. my bpd has worsened dramatically. i’m a final year student at uni and i suffer from bpd, social anxiety disorder, depression and adhd(not diagnosed but very likely), dyslexia &amp; learning disorder. i was born into a dysfunctional family as they had a boy who died of an accident before i was born. he drowned at the age of 3, while my father was working as an expat in london. this happened when my mother was busy taking pictures &amp; talking to her friends who came to visit mum from south korea. by the time she had realised that he was disappeared, it was already too late. this happened on my father’s birthday. it was a very traumatic event for my parents and my older sister.

there were just never ending family disputes, i saw them arguing and fighting everyday. i never got used to schools and was never able to socialise with kids, my overprotective(most likely caused by my brother’s death) mum suddenly flew to us without telling me and my sister when i was 7. after they got divorced, dad took our custody and i was forced to migrate to england with them. personally i wanted to live with mum but my sister made this decision for me as i was ‘too young’. the first month we arrived, i cried alone every night, in the new, unfamiliar country.

my father had serious issues with women. he completely ignored my opinions on my (ex)stepmother and her kids and got remarried before moving back to london. he said it was all for me and my sister but i knew that he just wanted her. he discovered that she cheated on him with a man she met at church and they always argued. she tried to kill dad and dad beat her up for cheating. 

even after they got divorced again after 2 years marriage, i was mentally abused(threatened, mocked and belittled) by adults like a punchbag(both parents, sister and teachers) and bullied at school for being the only asian kid whose english was poor, sexually assaulted at 12 by mum’s friend in vietnam, beaten up by dad with a golf club for refusing to go to school(a private school which costs £60 pounds a week according to him) and starved &amp; bullied  by (ex)stepmother and her kids, then raped by two men while i was still confused with my sexuality. i identify myself as lesbian. 

as a child, i worked hard at school though because i wanted that attention and love from dad and tutors. but it never got to me. my parents only used my performance at school to brag it to their friends and i was always home alone after school. my sister ran away after the stepmother incident and she lived alone ever since. dad was busy at work &amp; busy seeing women, always came home after i fell asleep but his co-worker(as well as his close friend) who was living with us, took care of me instead, treated me like a friend and father. i liked him because he’d cook for me, watch tv with me and listen to my sorrows. he left &amp; moved back to korea after a year though, apparently he called my mother and told her that he got eventually sick and tired of dad. i was upset that he was gone. 

i have so many problems myself and i know it. i’ve always wanted to break free from dad but i’m always so scared and unsure about myself and my life. i still want love and attention but i’m afraid of being hurt and neglected. i screwed up my a-levels when i discovered that my father got remarried second time to a woman without telling me / my sister. it was a marriage certificate that i discovered on the table and the woman is 24 years younger than him. it brought back all the memories of how i got abused by my (ex)step mother. i fumed and got mentally destroyed with betrayal. my immediate thought was ‘there had been already 3-4 suicide attempts before and is he trying to make me go through all this again?’. i confronted him ‘why didn’t you tell us? aren’t we your daughters?’ instead he replied ‘it’s none of your business’ ‘you have to move out once you’re in university anyway’. this hurt me so much. i kicked him and punched him for the first time ever. he started threatening me financially for ‘hurting’ him and for being ungrateful to a ‘birth parent’. his emotional abuse just never stopped and it is still ongoing to this day.

when i tell mum about problems in daily life, she laughed. she’s gone crazy for sure and i blocked her last month. i tell my sister about what i experienced, she just ignored me. i don’t blame her but i had to live with second stepmum for two months. the thought of her being a gold digger never got away and it was too stressful for me to handle so i moved out too at the age of 17/18. 

i was never happy with life. i’m still not sure what happiness feels like without drugs. everyday feels raw pain to me. i wake up in the morning thinking: ‘why did i wake up, i wished i never woke up’. i’ve been stuck in my room for 4 months now, after i was told my self-esteem is too low by one of university tutors during crit, some students stopped talking to me and started avoiding me. thus i stopped going into university. i’ve been on nhs cbt waiting list for 3 months but as my mental health worsened, they cancelled it &amp; transferred me under mental crisis care. almost everyday, different nurses came in just to check if i’m at risk of committing suicide. as i have social anxiety, this didn’t help at all but made me feel even more hopeless angry. 

i had taken so many different types of antidepressants over the course of 8 years on &amp; off. sertraline, prozac, citalopram, fluoxetine and so on. sertraline worked best for me while i was at 6th form but it doesn’t work for me anymore. i started having seizures since last november after breaking up with my date(who also had unhappy childhood). i think i was the cause but i don’t know what i did wrong. perhaps being too clingy, as she mentioned that i was ‘way too intense’. i feel sceptical about medications and i just want to end my life. i don’t see any hope for the future. i can’t get out because i can’t help thinking negative sides of people and what they could do to harm me. but again, i feel so lonely and isolated. so fucked up. 

i have already made specific plans to end my life. i’m just a mere individual in this world. life will go on even after i’m gone, no big deal. i want to be forgotten. i shouldn’t have been born. nothing i do is good. i want eternal sleep. for myself. i apologise for this long post, i wanted to clear my thought process. life isn’t for everybody... but i hope you all remaining bpd sufferers

Hoping my Psych will alter my Rx and finalize my diagnosis...,"i am going to see my psychologist today and discuss changing my medications. currently, i'm on zoloft and wellbutrin for depression and vyvanse for binge eating disorder, but i don't think depression is my issue. honestly, i think she may have mentioned me being diagnosed with bpd before, but i can't remember.

i don't quite know how to express all of these problems to her. i don't know if she'll fully understand what i'm trying to say. i'm also very worried that she'll push me to stay on my current medication. 

i just made a 3 page list of my questions, concerns, and symptoms and rated their intensity/ frequency on a scale of 1 to 10. if you actually read this novel, thanks... and please give me your input.

here we go...

1. i feel more anxious than depressed. i'm concerned the zoloft and wellbutrin are not helping with my current issues. adjusting the dosage has not given me any results. i also want to avoid taking a ""cocktail"" of medications.
2. i experience severe irritability, sometimes seemingly unprovoked. (8/10)
3. i have a lack of desire for social interaction. (10/10)
4. hearing my coworkers voices makes me tense. (9/10)
5. i worry what others think of me or may be saying about me. (7/10)
6. i compulsively pop, pick, and pluck hair, skin, and nail polish on a daily basis. (9/10)
7. i struggle with feelings and fear of abandonment. -- example, if a close friend (of whom i have few) intends to move, i find myself distancing from them emotionally or putting up a wall. sometimes, i even resort to anger as a form of defense. (8/10)
8. i find myself out of control with my food intake. my sweet tooth is a strong force and without the vyvanse, i tend to binge eat. (5/10)
9. when i am angry, i get the urge to physically express it. last week my husband and i got in a huge argument, resulting in me throwing our wedding photo down the hall and shattering the frame. (7/10)
10. this one, i simply wrote "" hard to explain... ""emptiness""/ void"". i can't really put that into words... i know that i should be happy. i own my home, work a great paying full-time job, have a loving husband and amazing kid... but something always feels unfulfilled somehow? (8/10)
11. i space out at random times. during conversation my attention may waiver or if i'm at my desk i let my mind wander to things i may have to do later... (6/10)
12. i at times will find myself feeling disconnected from my son and husband. i worry that i don't do enough for them or am not giving them the best of me and perhaps they resent me for my shortcomings. (6/10)
13. i experience moodswings frequently, and they can last from an hour to a couple of days. i'll go from feeling empty&gt; worried&gt; super attentive and productive/ creative&gt; exhausted&gt; hopeless and lost... on and on it goes. (9/10)
14. i am afraid of being invisible or unimportant. i often feel that i am. (7/10)
15. other times, i find myself feeling superior to others and overly confident. it's like ""super hero"" status kind of mania. (7/10)
16. i attempt to quell my negative feelings with reckless behavior. i'll drive erratically, indulge in some retail therapy, or eat my feelings. (7/10)
17. i often wake up, wide awake, at 2am. i take an otc sleeping aid nearly every night now. (8/10)
18. i notice a change in my behavior when i become close to someone. it's like i am a sponge and i'll absorb a characteristic of theirs. it could be a physical tendency or something they say on occasion. it could be an interest or eating habit. i'll see it and adopt it as my own characteristic. (5/10)
19. i create goals for myself (often a 30 day challenge related to my health) and i seldom reach them. (7/10)
20. i have been called cold, manipulative, and i'm seen as a bitch. (8/10)
21. stressful situations cause me to put up a wall and it causes me to be seen as ""aloof"" or as if i don't want to be bothered. (which... in some cases is true, but i don't want to be mean.) (9/10)
22. if i must socialize, i prefer one-on-one socialization. (6/10)
23. i find myself obsessing over a project or idea. whether it's the prospect of moving, buying a new car, or painting a bedroom. even if i find it is not within budget or unable to be completed, i'll continue spending a large amount of time looking into it. (6/10)
24. i sometimes feel that i can handle things better than others, or that my ideas and work are superior. it's bordering a strong sense of entitlement. (8/10)
25. any change in routine or situation causes me a great deal of stress. i panic at the idea of any instability disrupting what i do in my day to day. (8/10)

&amp;#x200b;

that's kinda all i could really put into words. it feels scattered and unorganized. i am afraid to switch up my medications and i worry that she may not fully understand my problem. i know that different medications work for different people, but i'm curious to hear what you all take if you find our symptoms mirror each other.

Any positive experiences with mood stabilizers?,"i’ve gotten to the point where i seriously need to be on mood stabilizers but i’m worried about the side effects. before i was diagnosed with bpd, i was on zoloft and xanax for my anxiety and depression and gained over 20 pounds.

Considering an alternative medication (help),"hello there! im 21 male young adult. ive been struggling with severe anxiety, some panic attacks here and there, irritable and low mood, laziness and some empty feelings (anhedonia) and sometimes low motivation. i started therapy some months ago, i don’t take drugs like i used to in the past (besides weed), i workout, i have some sunlight whenever possible, and my anxiety and overall mood does not improve that much. it helps, but i dont consider it enough. i have intense and dynamic emotions (i may have borderline disorder most probably) and worry too much about the future and family/friends. 

ive tried lamotrigine (mood stabilizer) for a few months and left me really lazy. tried sertraline (ssri) for a year and helped with anxiety and mood but also left me kinda lazy and i didn’t like it much (sexual side effects too!). ive been all 2020 without any medication (i quit them on my own). ive made research on bupropion (works on dopamine instead of serotonin) and i might give it a try. anybody has taken bupropion? how was it for you? side effects? thank you :)",1611615171,False,BPD,2021-01-25 22:52:51,"Considering an alternative medication (help) hello there! im 21 male young adult. ive been struggling with severe anxiety, some panic attacks here and there, irritable and low mood, laziness and some empty feelings (anhedonia) and sometimes low motivation. i started therapy some months ago, i don’t take drugs like i used to in the past (besides weed), i workout, i have some sunlight whenever possible, and my anxiety and overall mood does not improve that much. it helps, but i dont consider it enough. i have intense and dynamic emotions (i may have borderline disorder most probably) and worry too much about the future and family/friends.

Emotional numbness,"i've experienced this before. almost 8 years ago i was beginning to feel like my emotions went from a whole technicolor spectrum, to shades of off colors. i had been on zoloft for a year back then. i was on a really high dose (200mg) and at first it helped so much. i was getting back into liking school, i was less anxious, i rediscovered my passions, and i was doing so well. then at the end of my first semester in college i noticed it. i wasn't happy, i wasn't sad, i couldn't feel anything. everything was boring. i did my work because being on a routine made me feel stable and normal. i acted excited when i needed to. i faked sadness. i pretended to be happy...but i was just feeling to ghost of those emotions... not feeling them full force like i used to. which was a somewhat good thing. meeting and becoming friends with people is easier when you're not manic or depressed. 

it was just boring. i became a machine. only feeling what the others around me felt. pretending to fit it. 

then my parents' insurance decided that, since i was 19, and technically living on my own, they could kick me off... despite being in school. so i stopped my meds slowly to prepare myself for it. i started to feel better. i started to *feel*. then after being completely off it, everything turned upside down. i became irrational. completely turned upside down. i couldn't handle my emotions. everything was full force. it was like a dam burst. it couldn't flow like a steady river, it was a raging rapid. there was no middle ground for me...

i have been on so many medications it forget what i took. but two and a half years ago i decided i'd try zoloft again. it was the only thing that i took that kept me stable for a long time. i really didn't want to go back, and decided to try prozac. a week on that and one freak out told me i should just try zoloft again. i had a more capable doctor that specialized in mood disorders and i trusted him. i didn't want to have my mom come pick up my dog and get my daughter from school, because i couldn't stop the suicidal thoughts. i didn't want her to come to my house and find me, fully clothed in my shower with the water cold as ice and the lights off. 

i started zoloft in december 2017. i started small. then worked up. my doctor told me that he didn't want me to go above 100mg. if i started to feel a plateau i should lower the dose instead of increase it. in his experience, increasing it usually made it worse. 

i'm beginning to get back to the point. i have to force myself to feel sad. being happy is a fleeting feeling and it's gone as soon as it started. i can't cry as easily as i want. i get angry, but it just feels cold and bitter. i just want to feel again. feeling raw emotions is what being alive is all about. and lately i really need it. 

my daughter was born still in april. i feel so sad...but i can't release the emotion. it just won't come. it's a feeling i know is there, but just can't reach it. i want to cry, but i'm not sad enough to. i'm just empty. i need the release. i need to feel this pain, and stop pushing it away. zoloft, i need you to let me feel how i need to. so starting tomorrow, i'm going to take 3/4 of a pill. i'm going to do this for a week. if i begin to feel better, i'll keep it going until i see my doctor in the beginning of july. i already told her it was what i'd do. i know if it gets bad, i will stop and continue to take my full dose. 

i've been doing this for over a decade now...i'm basically an expert. i hope this works. i just want to feel again. i want to feel the sadness i know i'm harboring in my heart. i don't want to have to force myself to cry anymore. i want to cry, and let that release free me.",1561537249,False,BPD,2019-06-26 08:20:49,"Emotional numbness i've experienced this before. almost 8 years ago i was beginning to feel like my emotions went from a whole technicolor spectrum, to shades of off colors. i had been on zoloft for a year back then. i was on a really high dose (200mg) and at first it helped so much. i was getting back into liking school, i was less anxious, i rediscovered my passions, and i was doing so well. then at the end of my first semester in college i noticed it. i wasn't happy, i wasn't sad, i couldn't feel anything. everything was boring. i did my work because being on a routine made me feel stable and normal. i acted excited when i needed to. i faked sadness. i pretended to be happy...but i was just feeling to ghost of those emotions... not feeling them full force like i used to. which was a somewhat good thing. meeting and becoming friends with people is easier when you're not manic or depressed.

Drugs that work for you? Comorbid bullimia. Tried prozac--&gt;extreme fatigue,"hey guys,

wondering if any medications have worked successfully for you?  
i'm proposing some new ones to my gp.  
prozac has not worked for me, tried it for 2 years but because of extreme fatigue to the point falling asleep at desk i had to stop.  
zoloft did not work for me either, i started binge eating enormously.

i have used phentermine, which is not an ssri or anything like that, its something i got from my mum as a weightloss drug and that works exceptionally well for some reason?. but it is considered speed lol. i haven't mentioned this to the doctor though.  


anyway, i'm thinking of suggesting pristique and wellbutrin. opinions? i haven't thrown up in a while and have some control over this so i could get the clear for wellbutrin.

what else is out there?

my main is issues it that i have emotional dysregulation and i am hypersensitive to others.  
for instance, i will freak out if someone rolls their eyes at me, it will completely ruin my day without medication.  
with prozac, i was different but i am a med student and i could not focus or anything. i could not stay awake. i was sleeping most of the day and it destroyed my grades.

Coming off Zoloft (sertraline): what doctors DON'T tell you.,"i've been on zoloft for six months now to help with a depressive episode (i have mdd with my bpd). i read up on how everyone responds differently to ssris (and all meds, for that matter) so i went in with an open, albeit paranoid, mind.

i gave it the college try and found it wasn't for me. it numbed my emotions a bit, but i wanted to feel happy, not to just not feel, i can do that on my own with my bpd thanks very much. the side effects made it basically unbearable after a while. i got night sweats, vivid dreams and loss of sex drive as my top three. bingo! after the six months i went back for another psychiatric review and my doctors decided that i could come off it slowly. so i went from 150mg down to 100mg a day for a week no problems. then down to 50mg for a week. still no problems. then after a week of 50mg, i was advised to take them every other day to complete the taper before stopping. so the first day i didn't take one i was fine (i take them in the evening). next day i felt a little dizzy during the day but chocked it up to blood sugar. popped my pill that night and was horribly nauseous for the rest of the night, sweating bucketloads and waking up soaking wet and freezing cold.

the next day was the no-pill day and i found myself so dizzy i actually had to come home from work. i decided that since taking the pill had just made everything worse, so i made the executive decision to just go cold turkey from there on out. a decent night's sleep with slightly less sweating brings us to today. i am back at work, dizzier than yesterday, not willing to drive. i'm only here because i have stuff i absolutely must finish before the weekend, but i'll probably end up leaving early and cadging a lift home. 

ssri withdrawal is not easy and needs to be done carefully. they don't tell you that even when you do it right, you will still feel like absolute crap.

How do I even know if meds are doing something?,"i've been on a couple of meds throughout my life: sertraline, fluoxetine, escitalopram, quetiapine, alprazolam and oxcarbazepine.

but i swear, other from making me really sleepy (wich i hate so so so so much) i don't feel they have ever done much for my mood.

i know you're supposed to pair meds with therapy and i'm doing that but it makes me even more confused, cuz idk what's making me feel better when i do feel better. 

recently i (kinda dumbly tbh) stopped taking my meds because i ran out, and my mom made me feel paranoid that i maybe don't even need them so i thought nothing really would happen, and i wanted to stop feeling sleepy all the time.

but... i've been feeling very bad these days. like, relapsing on sh and panic attacks bad. but i still am not sure how much it's because of not being on meds.

i would hate to be overeacting. i've been told even by the psychiatrist that i tend to exaggerate and i already feel like he doesn't believe most of the things i say to him. 

i finally gathered courage to make an appointment with the psychiatrist, it's on tuesday and i'm shaking about what to say. i'm very embarrassed and i feel he's gonna be pissed.

BPD Recovery through Medication,"hi everyone. i’m going to share with you what helped me recover from my bpd. i was in and out of therapy and hospitalizations for years. i dealt with my trauma, i learned the coping skills but something was still very wrong with my brain. every little thing bothered me and made me upset and anything could be a trigger. my emotions were so intense it was as if something traumatic was happening to me everyday. i had extreme episodes of rage and sadness that i just couldn’t control. i was endlessly suicidal. i was self harming in extreme panic. during my last hospitalization, i was really out of control and i had delusional paranoia that the doctors and my family were conspiring against me. it was horrible. the psych prescribed me an antipsychotic called risperdal in the ward that i had no choice but to take even tho i was terrified it would kill me or permanently disable me. as soon as i took it i noticed a sense of calm come over me almost like a benzo would. my thoughts stopped racing and for the first time i felt real relief from my brain without the messed up feeling from a benzo. when i got out of the hospital a week later i noticed i had blurry vision like as if i needed glasses. i couldn’t see the tv very well and reading or driving was impossible. it took about another 2 weeks for that side effect to go away. it sounds scary, but honestly i felt so good from having relief from my brain that i was happy to deal with it. it’s 7 months later and i am thrilled to say that i am still stabilized. it feels like night and day difference and my loved ones see it too. the only other med i take is the lowest dose of zoloft bc the risperdal helps with my anger/paranoia/panic and the zoloft helps with the sadness. i have tried well over 15 different meds but i have finally found this golden combo. there is hope!

i got on ssris last year for anxiety and mild depression following a very bad breakup. lexapro 20mg for about 9 months. at first i was optimistic, this could really help me. the first few weeks fucking sucked. typical of starting ssris, fine. after the initial side effects, i continued to ride it out expecting to become some ""limitless"" version of myself. 

things seemed fine the first month or two. however i noticed i was neglecting my hobbies and interests. barely listening to music, didn't have the attention span to watch movies, tv or play video games. this is ok, i guess. it will pass. after some time i noticed it had been awhile since i felt that warm fuzzy happy feeling. nothing in my environment affected my emotions. my uncle, who i was fairly close with passed away. nothing. 

soon i realized i was riddled with anhedonia. there was no point in doing anything because nothing had a point. i stopped taking gigs for my business. didn't bother to work. i couldn't do anything besides lay in bed scrolling reddit or pace around my house chain smoking. i no longer wrote, hadn't touched my guitar in months. my memory was shot. i don't think i retained any information i learned in that time. i could barely remember my past. that was it. 

i finally accepted this was a problem so i contacted my psych and told her. she insisted i needed to be on medication regardless and switched me to zoloft. that's when shit hit the fan. everything i was dealing with became worse. i completely isolated myself because the idea of being around people was aggravating. i felt nothing for anyone and just wanted to be left alone. 

i couldn't live like this. i had to feel something, even if it was how i felt before. hell, the depression and anxiety i was fighting before seemed like ecstasy at this point. i told my psych i was done. she told me to taper down over the course of 4 weeks, which i now know was way too short, but i did it. 

the first week after the taper i felt the same. no noticeable difference other than minor ""brain zaps"". however week 2 kicked my ass. flu like symptoms and emotional changes that made my previous opioid detox feel like a vacation. this was hell. 

now here i am, 4 weeks later. the physical symptoms are gone along with the brain zaps. i'm slowly starting to feel things again but i don't feel like myself at all. i have this emptiness i can't describe. i feel completely disconnected from myself and have constant mood swings. i'm sure this too will pass but boy has this been a hell of a ride. 


2/10 would not recommend.

Maybe BPD? Help?,"hey all,

so i've had gad and depression for about 4+ years now (4 years since the diagnosis, maybe had anxiety/depression for longer than that; anxiety at least). anyways, i've had a history with substance abuse (alcohol, nicotine, weed, some slight dissociatives and opioids here and there). i've been sober for 2 years now and recently got off nicotine. i quit that and weed cold turkey while also starting zoloft and also going through a breakup... and.... i fucking lost my mind. like my anxiety and depression skyrocketed and i had really bad suicidal ideation. i was also thinking about doing some really bad behavior like trying harder drugs and trying to just have sex at any opportunity presented. i haven't done these two things yet.. but i've been thinking about it a lot. i started smoking weed again (just really been in a haze for a week now).

i've had two suicide attempts. i've had self harm (cutting, burned myself with a cigarette before). previously i've also had bad reactions to zoloft and prozac (both increase my suicidal thoughts and ideation). i got off zoloft about as quickly as i got on it this time and just switched to propranolol. things are just really bad. i've noticed that i have really bad ocd thoughts i can't get to stop. i'm just miserable and i can be really withdrawn for days on end where i won't talk to friends or family. i took some of the online diagnostic tests and i have read up on bpd and i just don't know what to do. whenever i am stressed out i always think about doing hard drugs and suicide... it's just whether or not i actually try it. like i find it soothing to look up facts about suicide and heroin when i'm upset. 

i act like a neurotic person in relationships and i constantly need reassurance. i'm terrible at keeping in contact with my friends. recently in these past two months i've been noticing that i am just a gaping hole and i rely a lot on outside things for emotional stability (music, tv, video games, previously nicotine, venting to people, etc). i'm never at peace and i can't just sit with my thoughts. i'm not happy and i feel like a shell. i overthink everything, especially with relationships. i've always felt like who i am depends on who i hang out with. i've been angry for like 4 years, and it's both what started the drinking and i feel like it hasn't gone away since i've stopped drinking. the last two jobs i had i didn't quit, i just went ghost. as college went on i stopped showing up to class. i've always been a procrastinator. i almost failed a class the semester before i graduated. i don't trust anyone. it's really hard for me. like to the point where it took me a year or so of therapy before i could even admit some things that i had in my head. 

i'm in a really bad place right now. i've seen a counselor for two years (specializing in cbt and dbt) but i've really struggled to commit to doing the homework. everyone always says that i just struggle with anxiety but after reading a lot of information on bpd it really sounded like i fit the bill. i took the diagnostic tests and they said i'm at risk but i also know they're just online tests. i'm really fucking scared i ruined this relationship with my impulsivity and poor rationale and i just feel like a fuck up man. i feel like i've irreparably fucked up my life and i can't do a damn thing about it. i mean i know i can make progress and stuff but.. what about all the things i've fucked up just realizing i need help?",1574226381,False,BPD,2019-11-20 05:06:21,"Maybe BPD?

i'm in a really bad place right now. i've seen a counselor for two years (specializing in cbt and dbt) but i've really struggled to commit to doing the homework. everyone always says that i just struggle with anxiety but after reading a lot of information on bpd it really sounded like i fit the bill. i took the diagnostic tests and they said i'm at risk but i also know they're just online tests. i'm really fucking scared i ruined this relationship with my impulsivity and poor rationale and i just feel like a fuck up man. i feel like i've irreparably fucked up my life and i can't do a damn thing about it. i mean i know i can make progress and stuff but.. what about all the things i've fucked up just realizing i need help?",maybe bpd help hey ive gad depression 4 year 4 year since diagnosis maybe anxietydepression longer anxiety least anyways ive history substance abuse alcohol nicotine weed slight dissociatives opioids ive sober 2 year recently got nicotine quit weed cold turkey also starting zoloft also going breakup fucking lost mind like anxiety depression skyrocketed really bad suicidal ideation also thinking really bad behavior like trying harder drug trying sex opportunity presented havent done two thing yet ive thinking lot started smoking weed really haze week ive two suicide attempt ive self harm cutting burned cigarette previously ive also bad reaction zoloft prozac increase suicidal thought ideation got zoloft quickly got time switched propranolol thing really bad ive noticed really bad ocd thought cant get stop im miserable really withdrawn day end wont talk friend family took online diagnostic test read bpd dont know whenever stressed always think hard drug suicide whether actually try like find soothing look fact suicide heroin im upset act like neurotic person relationship constantly need reassurance im terrible keeping contact friend recently past two month ive noticing gaping hole rely lot outside thing emotional stability music tv video game previously nicotine venting people etc im never peace cant sit thought im happy feel like shell overthink everything especially relationship ive always felt like depends hang ive angry like 4 year started drinking feel like hasnt gone away since ive stopped drinking last two job didnt quit went ghost college went stopped showing class ive always procrastinator almost failed class semester graduated dont trust anyone really hard like point took year therapy could even admit thing head im really bad place right ive seen counselor two year specializing cbt dbt ive really struggled commit homework everyone always say struggle anxiety reading lot information bpd really sounded like fit bill took diagnostic test said im risk also know theyre online test im really fucking scared ruined relationship impulsivity poor rationale feel like fuck man feel like ive irreparably fucked life cant damn thing mean know make progress stuff thing ive fucked realizing need help,0.9731264720494414,"['Fluoxetine', 'Propranolol', 'Sertraline']","```json

Doctors/Meds/Everything Sucks On the NHS [Rant] [Possible TW],"gah. summary.

* 10 years on/off therapy ages 15-18 then 22-25 (present).
* prescribed prozac aged 17, didn't take it.
* prescribed zoloft aged 24, been on it 3ish months now.
* most recent therapy was psychodynamic psychotherapy but my pdoc dumped me and told me a woman would be taking over. have yet to have an appointment with her. probably be january now. 


so. i went to my gp's today for a review on how my meds are working. should probably ask for advice here - how the fuck do you know if they're working? i'm up and down all the goddamn time but i forget about my mood changes so quickly it's difficult to keep track of how i'm feeling. for example, yesterday i was happy and productive and then i just dossed around on the internet during my workday, went home to put up christmas decorations with my partner, tried to be excited, wanted to burst into tears and cut myself, then five minutes later i was fine. ffs. so it's hard for me to know if the zoloft is helping. i'm up to 150mg now, and i don't want to top myself right at this very moment, but through my life i've had higher months and lower months so who the hell knows whether or not it's doing anything? i go through periods of being super-focused and on the ball at work and days like today where i spend the entire time on reddit and do the bare minimum i can get away with.

not so proud of myself.

anyway, i started meds prescribed by one gp three months ago and was given an appointment to see a different one for the review today. i checked with the receptionist and she assured me that they work together and it'd be fine. i've seen a few different gps at my practice and know it mostly depends on who's available (yayyy nhs) so i was cool with it. i walked in and sat down and the nice young lady doctor smiled at me. she asked why i was there so i explained about my meds. she asked what i was taking the meds for.

i'll just repeat that so you get the full extent of my horror.

**she asked me what i was taking the meds for.**

i explained to her that i am diagnosed with depression and that i'm being treated for bpd at a specialist clinic about 30 miles away, and that i'm awaiting a new appointment. i explained that i wasn't seeing the same pdoc there any more. 

she asked me who i was seeing about three times.

she asked me if i had had counselling before.

she asked me if i'd had cbt.

she asked me how the meds were doing.

she asked if i wanted to stay on the meds or come off them and try something different.

she asked how often i self harmed and if i still did (i told her yes and she asked me twice what i did to self harm and i had to tell her about my past overdoses).

she told me i shouldn't have children yet (not even something i'm thinking about!!).

she told me i should *talk to my partner about my negative feelings*.

she told me i should try [basic mindfulness skills i was taught in cbt; cbt being the therapy that *didn't help me* and why i was referred to the bpd clinic].

she told me that sometimes mental illnesses are just as bad as physical illnesses and that mental illnesses can be hard to accept and harder still to treat.

i sat there, reeling. i graciously accepted my prescription for more tablets, calmly explained to her that i had been in and out of therapy for ten years and that i would be seeing someone next month and no, cbt hadn't helped, and yes, i'd had counselling.

seriously. what. the. fuck. 

i have enough of an issue with being severely paranoid that i'm wasting nhs time and funds and there's nothing really wrong with me. i have enough of a problem with depression and admitting i have actual illness.
bpd has been a part of me for as long as i can remember and it destroys me that no one has ever taken me seriously or given me proper help when i asked for it. 

i acknowledge that i'm lucky enough at the moment. sure, i have no family, but i have a stable enough job with a fantastic boss who totally gets it, and a loving partner who stays with me even when i split with him.

but please, please, nhs, why am i having to deal with someone who can't even be arsed to read the medical records on the screen before dealing with me and quizzing me on my entire mental health history?

why am i having to call up and pester the specialist service i'm in just to get a confirmation that they haven't forgotten i exist after three months with no contact?

why am i put with a horrible pdoc who is patronising and mean with no alternative and then shunned by him in favour of another woman i have yet to meet?

why am i diagnosed with depression and 'paranoid anxiety' (but not even told what the fuck that is) but not with bpd or bipolar or any of the other myriad of things i probably tick the checklists for but yet have it constantly *hinted* to be by ""professionals"" that i have bpd?

why is it that i can't pick and choose my doctors and i feel far too vulnerable and scared to speak up about the way i'm being treated??

is there really just nothing wrong with me? am i wasting all this time? everyone's time, including my own? driving myself crazy by imagining i am?

they talked about antipsychotics, too. 

i can't tell if i'm crazy or not any more. i don't know. i just don't know.

i won’t do it, but it’s all i think about. inevitably killing myself. sticking around not because i’ve ever been able to have hope that things will be okay, but because my family and bf think i shouldn’t do it. obviously. i know that it only comes off as undermining their ability to decide what does and does not have value in this world, but nothing ever has or ever will convince me that they wouldn’t eventually be much better off after it’s done and over with and they can move on with their lives and see the beauty and wonder that would be there once i’m not a dark cloud in their life. why can’t they just see that? that it’s just a waste of time! someone here said they feel like an npc that only exists to create chaos and destruction in the lives of those around them. it’s so well put. 

it’s not for a lack of trying. ive been institutionalized 11 times for pathetic attempts on my life that never worked, and in rehab 9 times to get off heroin, recover from anorexia, get clean from self harm, and general mental health rehabilitation. it’s been so many times because i only completed three of them and got kicked out of the rest because i’m untreatable.

i went off my meds because i wanted to see how i could apply the skills i learned to love the way i’m supposed to without the crutch. i can. but  intense almost fucking romantic desire to kill myself is again a constant in my live. the only constancy out of everything. the only thing i’m intimately familiar with. the only thing i know i can do. i don’t tonos if i am capable of doing string else, but i know that i can do that. i failed it before because i was a coward. the cut was always just short of deep enough. the overdose one mg short of being lethal. i can move past actually doing it, i do that every moment

Here’s my daily routine,"hey this routine is what worked for me.  i cut a lot have bpd and anxiety and depression.  very unstable emotionally and in relationships. felt empty inside. done some crazy shit where a ended up in the hospital quite a few times.  i am a completely different person than who i was a year ago and i can confidently say that i am extremely satisfied with my life at the moment and very grateful for everyone who pulled me out of the hole.  so this was my average day when i didn’t have work or school.  i found if i did most of these things and took my meds at least tried to be productive and help calm myself down.  i have terrible apathy and i learned that i just had to do the opposite of my urge and gain control by sticking the the schedule and rewarding myself with netflix and candy and mini vacations.  i found i often got into trouble when i didn’t have a schedule, so this kept me on track to getting better! hopefully this is helpful to people with bpd, cutters, people with anxiety disorders and depression etc

Queries about medication...,"i've been on and off medication since 2014.

for some history - i started on citalopram and took it for a month until i stopped. then about a year later began taking sertraline and lamotragine which i only continued to take for two months, then switched to just sertraline which was for two months and now i'm on citalopram again and i have propranolol for if and when i'm really anxious.

i'm telling you the history of this because i've never been on medication long enough to truly feel the effects. it's partly to do with the fact that i don't necessarily enjoy being on medication, and also to do with my impulsivity. my bpd is always wanting to drag me back down. i have thoughts to stop taking my medication and to become sicker, and that's exactly what happened last year and is the main reason why i haven't been on any medication for long each time i've taken it.

so i was wondering, what do the long term effects feel like? do you feel more uplifted or neutral? does it help with any breakdowns you may have and low moods? is it worth me starting on them again?",1495711838,False,BPD,2017-05-25 11:30:38,"Queries about medication... i've been on and off medication since 2014.

medication / successful bpd meds,"so, ive only very recently been (almost) diagnosed with this. like they think its underlying but haven't told me, i got this from an foi request.

What are medications I can use with zoloft? Like mood stabilizers and anxiety control meds.,"i havent been able to take my meds for about two weeks now (second week and i have an appointment on friday) the reason why ive been off them for so long was because i didnt have a relfill for them since i was just starting out on them. well zoloft helps but since i've been off it i realised.......im fucking insane when off it.

seriously. they work wonders for depression but not great for anxiety and my moods which are caused by my bpd which pretty much comes from my ptsd (theres levels to this shit). like i have been losing my fucking mind ever since i've been off them and have been doing things i never would have. i think i need to be heavily medicated in order to keep myself safe because dude this shit has been rough. i thought i would be fine because it's just two weeks but nope. i was so wrong.

OCD during tougher times?? Sorry for long ass post.,"29, female, diagnosed officially about 6 years ago...
whenever things seem to be going great, something terrible happens and i become very very volatile.

this time it was confiding in a close friend, who is also my boss of nearly 9 years (bad, i know) that i had been contacted by a major news outlet to write about a story that i had posted on here. he immediately expressed that he wasn’t supportive and reminded me i need to keep my life simple. i’m 2fcking9 years old and i’m sick of everyone who’s known me long-term (through many struggles) trying to shelter me, which comes off more like treating me like an invalid. i tried to express that to him but he just ended up telling me to do whatever i wanted and then he left and didn’t come back for the day. after happened, when i left work, i ended up side swiping my car on a post ($700!!!!) (first time ever, been driving 14 years) and then when i got home my cats incision from her recent spay had opened up and there was blood everywhere (see my profile for more on recent cat health issues, serious stuff, especially if you use essential oils) i rushed her to the vet and they have had to keep her for a few days and a few more to go. then, my other cat got sick so i had to take her to the vet too. more money. i’m not a wealthy or even well off person, i’m pretty damn close to poor, really. then my boss told me i was dealing with too many issues (including my reddit media interest) and told me not to come to work until monday (this all happened on thursday). i interpreted it as a direct jab against me and i caused quite a bit of damage after maybe?? including telling many people close to me i quit my job when in reality i texted both bosses (the other boss is that ones dad) and asked for a performance review (why???) and i made threats of self harm to people who care for me. including one who is ill and helpless.
my boyfriend of 5 years lives 450 kilometres away (in august 2017 he went up there for a 3 week vacation and now we’re closing in on 3 years that he’s been gone) and comes back for 10 dayish long visits every couple months. when i go into these spirals, which have decreased, he isn’t usually here, and is usually conveniently away from his phone when i need someone to talk to.
my mom got a double lung transplant in january and from that day on my life has not been the same. we saw each other every day and now we barely can at all, i know it is not her fault she is just so busy with medical stuff but holy fuck am i lost without her. i do not have many friends, and although i am a very generous, nice, compassionate and fairly intelligent person, there is something odd about me, which usually results in people being drawn to be short term, but long term they create distance (borderlines know what i mean right?)
i have done years of dbt, tried so many meds (i react badly to all of them, anyone else experience this?? - cipralex, zoloft, foquest, concerts, paxil (this one was the best for me but then i got pregnant w my son (a real treat as an undiagnosed borderline at the time) and had to stop and then i guess the differences between my pre and post pregnancy body physiologically changed my reaction to paxil and i went fcking loco) concerta, lithium, welbutrin) and i just have these enormously disruptive lows that drive me so close to the edge i am scared sometimes. suicidal ideations are different for me as a mature borderline than they were in adolescence. they’re scarier because they seem so much more unavoidable. 

by this point you’re probably wondering when i’m gonna get to the ocd stuff - tbh once i started talking about everything i totally forgot about the point of this. anyways - i like things tidy and neat and clean. but when i spiral i become ocd about germs in my house - like dirty bathrooms and sinks and stuff. it bothers me to the point where i’m sick almost, i can’t eat, it’s just absolutely gut wrenching. and it isn’t that i’m concerned i’ll get sick - i really don’t care about my well-being to be honest - i’m just grossed out and then it feels like i can’t be comfortable in my own skin.

Question about Quetiapine &amp; does anyone take it ? If so what are your experiences/reactions etc?,"so a little bit of a backstory of me, i have bpd &amp; have had it for years (diagnosed approx 6 years ago now). i’ve never been successful with the medication prescribed for me. i’m pretty sensitive to side effects of medications and seemingly most times the side effects have been way more negative than the reward and i’ve eventually ended up coming off them and stopping medication altogether.

recently i went through something pretty traumatic to add on top of all the other traumatic things, and i’ve basically been experiencing high levels of mania, delusions and pretty intense mood swings daily, in reaction i suppose. 

my doctor went and prescribed me 25mg of quetiapine which i understand is a low moderate dose, i was on 250mg of insomnia inducing sertraline last year.

i’m a pretty big researcher / googler especially with pills and having reactions etc ( i got a itchy skin rash across my body from citalopram ). i did my research and it says for quetiapine, the big red bold main side effects are weight gain and increased appetite. my issues with this, like most other people with bpd, is that i’ve struggled with ed behaviours all through my life. 

after the most recent traumatic thing happened, i gained quite a bit of my weight as my bed/ starving kicked into full steam ahead and i’ve only just very recently managed to get this under control. 

has anyone taking this, experienced the rapid weight gain ? after working really hard to get my binge eating stuff manageable, i’m really afraid of taking this for it to escalate my ed again. 

(my doctor being the absolute *insert mean word for doctors here*, didn’t even explain to me about the side effects, look at my file at all, i mean the dude reduced my 10 min appointment to a 3 min one by telling me my emotions weren’t real and that everything i felt was my illness, real rad doctor he is 🙂)

Hypomania after starting tablets??,"yesterday morning i started lamotrigine and buspirone. 
lastnight my thoughts were racing.

i was fully focused and felt if i had the ways and means of testing my ideas - it would be a good experiment. i could see myself working in the scientific field. not really since im not qualified in the slightest, but felt my ideas were good enough, if you get me.

before the meds my mood had been quite flat. after a period of depression over the christmas, i was no longer depressed but not, not depressed either. if that makes sense. 

i felt so energized by my thoughts and felt quite good. it is not an unfamiliar feeling as i have been here on many occasions, only with different things. usually involving science. this time it was about the brain, consciousness and a coma. other times it has been about space, time travel, alternate  universes. alternate universes were included with last nights thoughts. 

usually topics with endless questions and answers. 

last time i was at this point i had started sertraline. yesterday i started lamotrigine.

Codependent “cyclothymic/bipolar spectrum” individual with questions for those of you affected with Borderline Personality Disorder,"disclaimer: im not seeking a diagnosis from any of you. (i would only leave such claims to medical “professionals”). im looking for trends amongst this community’s illness that may be prominent in my dysfunctional lifestyle so that i can seek more effective help for once in my life. i need professional help. any of your input is greatly appreciated, thank you for taking the time to read my post.

hello. i’ve been treated for bipolar spectrum illness for almost 3 years. ive been suicidal since i was 12. i’m 18. 

i feel like i’ve been misdiagnosed for the reason that i have extremely codependent tendencies. dangerously on and off in my relationship, anger and love in constant battle that destroys my life. literally feeling like dying without her. then wanting to never see her again. taking sleeping pills when she wont talk to me. blocking her when she triggers me.

in my research behind codependent relationships (online lectures and books by psychotherapists specializing in codependent relationships) i have found that an individual with any type of personality disorder is usually a key ingredient for a codependent relationship. a dysfunctional person, one who denies being ill and refuses treatment (me).

my parents dont force me to have a pdoc/therapist because one is absentee and the other is sort-of easy to fool. i prefer to hide my problems because theres so much social stigma around being a mentally dysfunctional male.

i’ve been hospitalized for suicide
had drug and alcohol problems
major depressive episodes
cyclothymic hypomania (never full mania)
been on paxil, seroquel, lamictal, xanax, zoloft (prescription) 
i no longer take medication because i would abuse it to try to hurt myself, and i had a lot of nightmarish side effects. i also believe that my old psychiatrist was over medicating me which has made me distrustful of psychiatrists and medication. this psychiatrist (one ever saw him) was retiring and didnt care about me, i dont know why i went to him. i was too young to understand what a good psychiatrist was like. i use extensive exercise and bad coping mechanisms to calm myself down when needed.

my question is, do you find any similarity between your problems in mine. were any of you called manic-depressed before you were called bpd? is codependency something that most of you struggle with?

what do you do to cope? meditation, exercise, psychiatric medication?

seriously, any input is really appreciated. i need the help of a therapist and i need to stop lying to myself about being normal. i need to stop denying treatment. again, thank you for taking the time to read my post. it means a lot to me, to hear from people who know first-hand what it is like to have bpd.",1518655342,False,BPD,2018-02-15 00:42:22,"Codependent “cyclothymic/bipolar spectrum” individual with questions for those of you affected with Borderline Personality Disorder disclaimer: im not seeking a diagnosis from any of you.

"New Diagnosis, Like Reading My Autobiography...","cliffnotes: 

1. i'm interested to hear what medications others are taking to help manage bpd.  i'm on trileptal for the off-label benefit of a mood stabilizer... what are others taking currently?  i've heard sertraline, which might be my next stop if the trileptal doesn't work.
2. bpd stinks obviously, and outside of meds, how can i prevent myself from getting stuck in the rut of thought processes that come with bpd...
3. who have you informed of your bpd? spouses are probably on this list, but what about supervisors, coworkers, bosses, friends, family... curious to hear this one too!

now to the post...

well, for what its worth, i spoke with my psychiatrist, and we both came up with the conclusion that i have bpd.  when i read symptoms online, it was like i was reading my autobiography.  the symptoms and experiences that someone with bpd has were shockingly close to what i experience in my daily life.  i don't think i experience the splitting that comes with bpd, but since i never knew what to look for in the first place, i'm sure that might change, now that i know what to look for in splitting.

someone on here posted this: ""i love having bpd, it adds variety to my life, and keeps me on my toes guessing"".  i sincerely hope that they were kidding, or being facetious.  i, probably along with everyone else, would lob off limbs if i were told it would get rid of bpd.  it's not something you should love to have, it's not something you should use to provide variety or spice in your life, and it's not something that anyone would truly want in their life...at least to me.  hopefully, that was a troll, and not someone who experiences the pain and suffering that comes with bpd.

as everyone knows, there's no fda labeled treatment for bpd.  however, my psychiatrist started me on trileptal, a medication known to help with seizures, but has a well known off-label usage for mood stabilization.  he said that should help me out with the symptoms that i experience, when used twice daily.  it's been about a week, and i haven't felt differences that are storybook-worthy, but i guess my pharmacist said it could take a few weeks to get the full effects.

i think it stinks that they make medications for all sorts of mental disabilities (depression, manic episodes, ptsd, mdd, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar, etc) but can't come up with something that will directly treat bpd.  i do have to give kudos for my psychiatrist to know what off-label treatments exist, discuss the options with me, weigh the pros and cons, and decide what is right for me.

and how public does everyone get with bpd? are you advocating it to friends and family to raise awareness? or are you looking at it as an embarrassment and not telling anyone?  i'm not looking for an excuse or a pardon for my behaviors, just want others to understand why i do what i do, and why i say what i say, and why i think what i think.

Med change = emotional mess,"i've been all over the place lately. my therapist even told me she hasn't seen me this bad in years. i saw her twice last week because i was such a wreck.

i saw a new psychiatrist on a tuesday and we're in the process of taking me off cymbalta and zoloft and changing me to lamictal. i've never had a mood stabilizer before. 

so far i feel miserable. i took it tuesday night (and stopped cymbalta). didn't sleep well. i was fine until about 1pm yesterday when all of a sudden it felt like i was really high. i got some lunch but that didn't help. i ended up leaving work.

i got really down last night, couldn't sleep well at all. woke up this morning with really bad body pain, very very sad, super lonely. i am off work this morning to have a plumber over but i just don't think i have the strength to go in at all today.

how long will this last? i don't want to give up 2 days in. 

my soul aches with sadness and loneliness. i'm wasting my time on a guy who isn't even sure when he'll be in the same state as me again. i'm doing emotional labor for another guy who just last week was suicidal and now is all happy as can be because he had a hookup that went really well. i was trying to plan a birthday lunch for my work best friend but since i'm not there her supervisor (who she hates) has taken credit for it.

i am a impulsive person which is i guess ''normal'' in bpd, but i don't feel like i have true manic episodes when i'm off meds. though after 3 months on citalopram (try 2 times, 3 months each), i've kinda felt like i've been in a manic episode: spent lot of money (more than i can) in designer clothes-helipcopter-airplanes tickets for 2-3 days vacations-limos-even a hot air balloon (please don't laugh :3), became involved in way too manies activities at work and outside of it, couldn't filter what i say., became more promiscuous than usual... so i've dropped citalopram and my doctor prescribed zoloft instead. i've only spend 5 days on zoloft and after that i couldn't sleep at all, and my thoughts were way too quick so i've became scared of a ''manic'' episode and drop again.

[Lamictal/Lamotrigine] Anyone experienced that a lower dosage below the therapeutic dosage worked better?,"i started lamictal about a year ago, and it's worked well for my bpd in addition to zoloft and wellbutrin (i'm not the biggest fan of wellbutrin, but i literally cannot wake up in the mornings without it. tried, and had to go back on 'em). lamictal has been a lowkey lifesaver for me. it doesn't stop the mood swings, but it's kinda like it gives me a warning a split second before emotions hit after a trigger, so that i'm kinda like ""uh oh, here it comes"" – kinda like looking at a massive wave about to hit you and you just go ""fuck."" and then get slammed.

i’m 30 days sober. that’s a huge thing for me and has been really hard, but drinking made my moods extreme and my rage and outbursts where so cruel. my rational was that it numbed me out, but it didn’t really, just made me avoid everything instead. i verbally abused my loved ones while drunk and said some of the most horrible things. most i don’t remember cause i was drinking to the point of blacking out. 

quitting drinking has helped my  moods stabilize and my meds seem to help with anxiety and focus. adderall isn’t helping with impulsivity though and that’s why i was prescribed it. i don’t have the psychosis side of bpd (i do get paranoid, but it’s for things like my evil ass mom doing some sneaky ass move to manipulate me etc)

Does Zoloft really help with bpd?,"i was on zoloft for about a month and it sort of slowed me down and made me sleep heaps so i stopped taking it. i got on my feet and have done a lot since - moved out, studying, working etc. i managed to do it without my therapist and if i’m going to be honest my fp at the time was convincing me off it. he said i changed and i wasn’t happy. recently, i was under a lot of pressure and decided to take one. i blocked my fp when i started taking it because i realised i was much happier with it than with him. that process repeated itself and i got off the zoloft when my fp came back into my life. 

i cut my fp off for good now and i’ve started taking zoloft again because of some severe suicidal thoughts. i know i shouldn’t start and stop, which is why i’m currently looking for a new therapist. i guess what i want is a different perspective from somebody who has taken antidepressants long term. is it worth me taking it? i know it helps me calm down and relax but i’m scared it’ll effect me a lot more down the track. sorry if that was too much to read. any advice is highly appreciated. thank you.",1600176518,False,BPD,2020-09-15 13:28:38,"Does Zoloft really help with bpd? i was on zoloft for about a month and it sort of slowed me down and made me sleep heaps so i stopped taking it. i got on my feet and have done a lot since - moved out, studying, working etc. i managed to do it without my therapist and if i’m going to be honest my fp at the time was convincing me off it. he said i changed and i wasn’t happy. recently, i was under a lot of pressure and decided to take one. i blocked my fp when i started taking it because i realised i was much happier with it than with him. that process repeated itself and i got off the zoloft when my fp came back into my life.

Experience with Zoloft?? Please help,"i'm on my second try of an antidepressant. first one was effexor and i had horrible side effects. switched to zoloft 25mg about 12 days ago. after about 4 days i thought i was feeling better but now i'm wondering if that was just placebo. then skip to about days 7 or 8 to today and i feel, well, shitty. i'm more irritable, easily overwhelmed, definitely more tired (need a lot more sleep) and overall just feel a lot more down. ;(

my boyfriend said i've been wild in my sleep. tossing and turning, yelling and smacked him. :( :( :( i've also been having nightmares.

my question is, is this normal? i've heard people say, antidepressants pull you down then bring you back up. but maybe that's bs?

What therapy works? (+ medication),"can anyone tell me what's worked for them? 

i've had dbt when i was a teenager and idk if i just wasn't in the right headspace but it didn't do anything for me at the time. i was very suicidal and would dissociate a lot so i didn't feel the coping skills helped me as when i got to that blackout stage i couldn't use any of the coping skills as i didn't remember what happened to me. 

i had one session of psychotherapy many years ago which i found very interesting and thought it could possibly help me with a lot of childhood stuff but was always told i was too vulnerable and unpredictable so i wasn't right for it. 

i'm due to have my initial assessment to look at what therapy i can have at the end of the month and i'm actually lost. i don't want to accept dbt just because they would think it's the go to for bpd when i know it's never helped before, just for it not to help again then me be left on another months long waiting list for something else 😩

also is there any medication anyone has found that helps? i've been on fluoxetine, sertraline, diazepam and quetiapine none of which i've found has helped. i've always been very against accepting anti psychotics as i also suffer on and off with anorexia and i'm worried about the weight gain aspect. but if there's a medicine i know outweighs the side effects i'll definitely consider.

"Medication, change, and hope","like many of you i've been in a decently large mess for a long time with my mental health. i was brought up with a bpd mum, bpd older sister, and bpd/bipolar 1 father, so you can imagine what kind of personality that fosters in a young kid (not helped by autistic traits which went undiagnosed due to the kinds of chaos that this family dynamic creates). i struggled with anxiety and panic from age 6, depression from 13, and manic/psychotic traits from time to time starting at 23; again, like probably most of you. try as i might i couldn't get control of things and ended up in hospital a few times as a result; eventually i got my psychiatrist to try me on medication despite there being little documented evidence of drugs being a good approach to the treatment of bpd. 

i posted here and there on reddit while trialing different drugs about the issues i encountered while doing so; allergic reactions, side effects, and the emotional baggage that came with it relating to my upbringing. sertraline, citalopram, duloxetine, propranolol, depakote, and reams of sleep drugs brought me no success over 5 years. eventually however i got to try lamotrigine, which i was interested in because apparently it was less sedating and had less weight gain.  

in short this drug is giving me my life back. my head is alert and busy, but calm and focused. there have been no urges to self harm whatsoever, which used to be a weekly occurrence. no flashes of blind rage. the anxiety i have is now contextualized and kept in proportion, and i can easily take control of my feelings when i need to so i can explore them without the safety implications there were before. i started volunteering with young people with mental health needs, so i could make some good come out of my experiences, and have received glowing praise from my colleagues in the process. a year ago i was too frightened to use the phone or be outside for any length of time; 6 months ago i wasn't showering, abusing drugs, and wasn't ever functional for more than a few days at a time, etc.

i've worked hard in addition to being medicated, but the point is that right when you feel like its time to write off this life, you might just run headlong into a solution. it always feels like forever when you're in the midst of a relapse or a stressful period, and very little makes that easier, but **you might only be a step away from big changes and not realise it**. so whatever's going on, however you're tackling it, however bleak the outlook, you need to keep the faith that eventually you will feel different as long as you work hard and persevere.

Quitting antipdepressants cold turkey..,"so i was maxed out on two antidepressants, zoloft and wellbutrin, but i felt as if they were essentially having no effect. against my pdocs orders, i quit both cold turkey. bad form, i know...i had recently added seroquel and lamictal, which seem to be giving  positive results, and i did not want to be on so many meds, especially those which seemed to be doing nothing, aside from the typical side effects. since coming off, i feel like an emotional basketcase. i feel like i could cry at the drop of a hat, sometimes over the strangest stuff. i can handle the brain zaps, the crappy sleep, etc.. but this emotional shit is getting to be a bit much for me. anyone gone through something similar?",1467739525,False,BPD,2016-07-05 17:25:25,"Quitting antipdepressants cold turkey.. so i was maxed out on two antidepressants, zoloft and wellbutrin, but i felt as if they were essentially having no effect. against my pdocs orders, i quit both cold turkey. bad form, i know...i had recently added seroquel and lamictal, which seem to be giving  positive results, and i did not want to be on so many meds, especially those which seemed to be doing nothing, aside from the typical side effects. since coming off, i feel like an emotional basketcase. i feel like i could cry at the drop of a hat, sometimes over the strangest stuff. i can handle the brain zaps, the crappy sleep, etc.. but this emotional shit is getting to be a bit much for me. anyone gone through something similar?",quitting antipdepressants cold turkey maxed two antidepressant zoloft wellbutrin felt essentially effect pdocs order quit cold turkey bad form knowi recently added seroquel lamictal seem giving positive result want many med especially seemed nothing aside typical side effect since coming feel like emotional basketcase feel like could cry drop hat sometimes strangest stuff handle brain zap crappy sleep etc emotional shit getting bit much anyone gone something similar,0.937643259810234,"['Bupropion', 'Lamotrigine', 'Quetiapine', 'Sertraline']","```json

A super sad true 'love' story,"i assume that i have been afflicted with this disorder my whole life. when i was 15 years old - the dark symptoms began to show. my first relationship came to an end and i quickly turned manipulative and suicidal - suicidally manipulative.  


after that my relationships seemed normal - of course they were just the disorder taking a different form. i was so afraid of being abandoned that whenever i was in a relationship i would talk to other girls, so that i would have somebody else when the existing relationship ended. talk about fearing being alone. 

then i fell 'in-love' again, in reality i was co-dependent. shortly after my 17th birthday the relationship spiraled out of control. after she cheated my self-hating anger became all-consuming and the dark symptoms were back ten-fold. i had several pseudo-suicide attempts and never sought out treatment. 

by time i was 18, i fell in love, again. this time i made sure i would not hurt the girl i loved. of course i was super-co-dependent and practically spent everyday with my so. it was great - but four months in i became jealous. this time my anger was not directed at her but at myself. i started becoming a heavy marijuana user. this led to being a heavy drinker - and abusing various drugs. 

my downward spiral was enough to make my so leave me, although i was ultimately the one who ended the relationship. my life continued to spiral and i was subsequently arrested for dui and 6 counts of possession. my drug use helped me to escape and 'not feel.' this lasted for about a year. then one morning after binging with benzos the night before i broke down. i was suicidal once again, this time i admitted myself to a psychiatric unit where i stayed for a total of 9 days. 

while i was there i was diagnosed as major depressive and prescribed zoloft and wellbutrin. by the time i was discharged i felt like 'myself' a healthier version of myself. the next four months were the best of my life. i went back to university after my hospital stay and finished off the semester with a 3.8 gpa - i worked out nearly every day - ate the best healthy food i could - and was ultimately content with my life.

then everything fell apart - again.  a friend of mine was having her 21st birthday party. i have always been extremely attracted to her and we had been flirting for weeks before this ( even though she had a boyfriend.) she picked me up at the train station and threw me completely off guard when she said there was going to be a guy that she was interested in at her party - not her boyfriend, not me..

so i tried my best to maintain my composure, after all i was on the high dose of the happy pills ( which should not be mixed with alcohol.) i caved and popped an ativan to deal with the anxiety. 

then i was thrown off my game again, she confessed her love for me and we started kissing. at this point my memory got fuzzy but for some reason she started hooking up with the aforementioned guy and i retreated back into my drug abuse. i began popping ativan like tic-tacs, and even drank. my memory from this point forward is practically non-existent but i remember sneaking out of her house trying to 'run-away' ultimately making my way back to the house and passing out. 

it has been over 6 months since that day.. i stopped taking my anti-depressants - smoked copious amounts of weed. this is my story, but i will not allow it to define my life. today is day 1. today i will get help.",1419964584,False,BPD,2014-12-30 18:36:24,"A super sad true 'love' story i assume that i have been afflicted with this disorder my whole life. when i was 15 years old - the dark symptoms began to show. my first relationship came to an end and i quickly turned manipulative and suicidal - suicidally manipulative.

UK based resources and help?,"a few years back when i started recognising my self destructive behaviours i took myself to the gp in my hometown and explained everything. she asked me about my childhood and history etc, and said it very much sounded like bpd. she prescribed me prozac and referred me to a psychiatrist for an assessment.

the prozac didn’t work, so they moved me to sertraline, which also didn’t work. 

i’m now entirely untreated. i’ve been working a lot on my triggers and coping mechanisms and i’m a lot more stable than i was then, but after a recent break down of a relationship (and just this year generally) i’m starting to notice the same pattern of behaviours i was exhibiting then (excessive drug and alcohol use, angry outbursts at friends, self harm etc) and i know it’s really not healthy. 

i can’t afford private therapy or assessment. i’m dubious about going back to the doctor because even though i’m in the capital city now and resources are better here i’m generally wary of what they might say or if i’ll be dismissed again. does anyone have any advice? has anyone else been through their gp, or does anyone know of any other resources/charities i could reach out too? does anyone have any advice on medication, if prozac and sertraline didn’t work? just looking for some thoughts from people who’ve been here before!",1605266903,False,BPD,2020-11-13 11:28:23,"UK based resources and help? a few years back when i started recognising my self destructive behaviours i took myself to the gp in my hometown and explained everything. she asked me about my childhood and history etc, and said it very much sounded like bpd. she prescribed me prozac and referred me to a psychiatrist for an assessment.

Trying to be kind to myself (Trigger Warning: Binge eating disorder),"hey there i wanna start off by blatantly saying that i am aware that i am kinda writing this for validation and because it helps to write down positive thoughts.

basically i have been struggling with bed for the past 5 years and particularly over the last 2, psychiatric medication, medical school application stress and an unfortunate series of painful occurrences in my romantic life aggravated the situation. i reached my all time high weight on february this year due to the aforementioned issues. later, i switched from 20mg lexapro to 150mg wellbutrin + 200mg zoloft. this combination gave me, in every way, my life back after years of feeling anxious and profoundly self-conscious. that being said, the weight loss part of my improvement didnt come easy, because although i had the med school thing out of the way (i was accepted in march) and like i said was overall feeling better mentally, dieting is still something that freaks me out and admittedly finally having it in me to hang out more with friends (and thus drink more, smoke weed etc...) also didnt help as i found myself having many “fuck it” moments. obviously some quarantine boredom and anxiety around covid were other contributing factors. anyway i did manage to climb down from 156lbs to 128lbs in september, but being away in college, loneliness, missing friends and family, way too much drinking and another unrequited love caused me to gain a lot of it back, the last time i weighed myself was last week and i was at 141lbs, which is still technically healthy for my height but still not where i’d rather be at.

anyway so tonight i found out about how the modern family actress ariel winter lost 30lbs after starting wellbutrin and i know it is sort of a stimulant and appetite-suppressant and all that. and that gave me an insecurity crisis, as i dont notice any decrease in hunger on it and like i said am far from thin despite my meds. i guess it may help a little bit with food cravings maybe, because i find myself daily things more, but i still absolutely love eating. so then all those “lack of self-control”, “weak”, “addict” etc... labels, that i have often struggled with, came to mind. please, if any of you have any stories of having lost copious amounts of weight on wellbutrin, do not share as i am in a fragile state of mind atm and feel like that would just further trigger me immensely.

in conclusion though, as much as i feel a little disappointed with myself, i must also recognise that it has not been an easy year, actually the past 7 years or so have been intense, mostly in a bed way. thus, i am tryinh to focus on the positive - i am studying a subject i love tp hopefully pursue a career i am passionately about, i have a few people who do care a lot about me and obviously weight or physical appearwnce for that matter are not everything.

Very anti social and I love having no human interaction.,"this is long but it's a realistic story about living with bpd.

i was diagnosed with many mental illnesses in the military.  i am a real professionally certified borderline personality disorder sufferer. throw in a dash of paranoia and schitzophrenia and chronic depression and i am a certified mess. i'm not sure if the military made me this way but i suspect it may have been a large part of it.  although, i think i have had it from the begining of about 10 yo.  i'm still here. i still find beauty in the world... just not with people.

i know this is supposedly not the place for politics but politics and values are a huge part of my issue and i believe a large part of why we all are becoming depressed and withdrawn from social interaction. for me it's why i don't want to interact with anyone anymore.  i think sweeping politics under the rug could possibly be preventing people from getting the help they need.

i have a large friends group but since i am fomer military most of my friends are far right. i just can't listen to the stupid retoric anymore and don't want to be around them.  i haven't talked to my best friend in over 2 years, to me we aren't friends anymore. i used to find common ground but politics have gotten out of hand in this country to the point that there is no escaping things turning political.  it happens every conversation.  it dosen't matter if im talking to a righty or a lefty, i hear the dumbest stuff from both of them.  it's gotten to the point where i can't go an hour with out hearing the name of the political boogeyman of either the left or the right depending on who i am talking to. i was talking about upgrading my kitchen and the cost and some one interjects well if &lt;insert boogyman here&gt; wouldn't have done this to cause inflation things would still be cheap.

i used to think my lefty friends were smarter but now many of them have become so obsessed with corona virus and that one orange guy that they have just become opposite sides of the same coin.  

so now i find my self being obesessed with chosing my words so carefully that i find myself saying little to anything at all. for a few months people would talk and i would just say vanilla stuff like.  ""oh that's an interesting viewpoint.""  or ""oh yeah, i don't know, you could be right.""  'well, everyone is entitled to thier opinon."" but now i'm like ""that's not true and you know it."" or ""do you have any evidence to back up that idiotic claim?"",  ""where did you hear that suspect crap from?"".  all of a sudden they are taken aback. i feel like i used to be their echo chamber listening to their torturous ignorant yapping. but i am done.

i yelled at one of my friends after going on and on about coronavirus safety and how right wingers are endangering everyone. ""if your so damn concerned about masks why are you at a party without one you fucking hypocrite. do you know everyone here, do they have the vaccine have you checked for cards?""  well um i um no...  then i made a condecending voice mimicing him i said ""then shut up about it"" and left. i haven't talked to anyone at that ""party"" since.

i went to my last gathering with my veterans motorcycle group after we got into a heated discussion when one of my ""brothers""  explained in detail why he believed derek chavin should be found innocent, which is unconscionable to me.  which set me off i laid into him agressively for 2 minutes culminating with me putting my middle finger right againt the bridge of his nose. then i chirped out and sold my motorcycle the next day.  i haven't talked to any of them for months. i also deleted my facebook and all social media accounts that day.

my wife and i have been to counciling for me. i feel bad because my behavior is now affecting my wife's social life.  she also had the same friends group and now she says that it's become akward and people feel like i have become a loose cannon and they are afraid for her safety.  i asked her if she felt unsafe and she said no but i'm concerned for you. 

i went to a mental health professional that i have only seen a handful of times.

my therapist said,  you are a high risk individual for self harm.  i said ""wow jeeze i'm glad i paid $257 for such expert analysis doc.""   she said ""you need to lose weight"" ""wow, another stuning revelation""  luckily, she laid into me and said ""do you want help or not? i can't help anyone who cant help themselves.""  i told her ""fair assesment. i'll listen.""  she said ""i'm going to give you lexapro.""  i was like an ssri like zoloft?  her: ""slightly different.""  me: ""i'll just asssume as a professional you aren't steering me wrong.""   so now i'm on lexapro and i don't know how well it's working.  i still have no desire to interact with people outside of my wife and son. 

i wrote this post because i just got a message from my college professor ""friend"" that he is having a bbq on the 7th of may and wants me to come.  for a split second i was like yeah i'm on lexapro and i'll rise like a phoenix out of the ashes and become a better person and then during our conversation where i explained some of the issues i was having and then he said some condecending garbage about uneducated republican yokles are unbareable.  so i texted ""screw you and your barbeque you pretentious prick. lose my number.""  he replied. "" i'm sorry you feel this way,  i hope you get the help you deserve."" which made me roll my eyes and feel good about the decision i made.

so i'm back to square one. i hate everyone and the drugs aren't making me like people any more. i have burned all my bridges and am starting to affect my wife negatively.  

i feel like once someone is too far gone like me.  it's just better to become a hermit and limit social interaction. i'm thinking i should get a divorce let my wife have everything and i can move somewhere in the middle of nowhere.

what is wrong with our brains?  is it food, is it our jobs?  it it just modern life? what is it?

i feel like this maybe the only place i can be understood.",1618785004,True,BPD,2021-04-18 22:30:04,"Very anti social and I love having no human interaction. this is long but it's a realistic story about living with bpd.

i was diagnosed with many mental illnesses in the military.  i am a real professionally certified borderline personality disorder sufferer. throw in a dash of paranoia and schitzophrenia and chronic depression and i am a certified mess. i'm not sure if the military made me this way but i suspect it may have been a large part of it.  although, i think i have had it from the begining of about 10 yo.  i'm still here. i still find beauty in the world... just not with people.

i know this is supposedly not the place for politics but politics and values are a huge part of my issue and i believe a large part of why we all are becoming depressed and withdrawn from social interaction. for me it's why i don't want to interact with anyone anymore.  i think sweeping politics under the rug could possibly be preventing people from getting the help they need.

i have a large friends group but since i am fomer military most of my friends are far right. i just can't listen to the stupid retoric anymore and don't want to be around them.  i haven't talked to my best friend in over 2 years, to me we aren't friends anymore. i used to find common ground but politics have gotten out of hand in this country to the point that there is no escaping things turning political.  it happens every conversation.  it dosen't matter if im talking to a righty or a lefty, i hear the dumbest stuff from both of them.  it's gotten to the point where i can't go an hour with out hearing the name of the political boogeyman of either the left or the right depending on who i am talking to. i was talking about upgrading my kitchen and the cost and some one interjects well if &lt;insert boogyman here&gt; wouldn't have done this to cause inflation things would still be cheap.

i used to think my lefty friends were smarter but now many of them have become so obsessed with corona virus and that one orange guy that they have just become opposite sides of the same coin.  

so now i find my self being obesessed with chosing my words so carefully that i find myself saying little to anything at all. for a few months people would talk and i would just say vanilla stuff like.  ""oh that's an interesting viewpoint.""  or ""oh yeah, i don't know, you could be right.""  'well, everyone is entitled to thier opinon."" but now i'm like ""that's not true and you know it."" or ""do you have any evidence to back up that idiotic claim?"",  ""where did you hear that suspect crap from?"".  all of a sudden they are taken aback. i feel like i used to be their echo chamber listening to their torturous ignorant yapping. but i am done.

i yelled at one of my friends after going on and on about coronavirus safety and how right wingers are endangering everyone. ""if your so damn concerned about masks why are you at a party without one you fucking hypocrite. do you know everyone here, do they have the vaccine have you checked for cards?""  well um i um no...  then i made a condecending voice mimicing him i said ""then shut up about it"" and left. i haven't talked to anyone at that ""party"" since.

i went to my last gathering with my veterans motorcycle group after we got into a heated discussion when one of my ""brothers""  explained in detail why he believed derek chavin should be found innocent, which is unconscionable to me.  which set me off i laid into him agressively for 2 minutes culminating with me putting my middle finger right againt the bridge of his nose. then i chirped out and sold my motorcycle the next day.  i haven't talked to any of them for months. i also deleted my facebook and all social media accounts that day.

my wife and i have been to counciling for me. i feel bad because my behavior is now affecting my wife's social life.  she also had the same friends group and now she says that it's become akward and people feel like i have become a loose cannon and they are afraid for her safety.  i asked her if she felt unsafe and she said no but i'm concerned for you. 

i went to a mental health professional that i have only seen a handful of times.

my therapist said,  you are a high risk individual for self harm.  i said ""wow jeeze i'm glad i paid $257 for such expert analysis doc.""   she said ""you need to lose weight"" ""wow, another stuning revelation""  luckily, she laid into me and said ""do you want help or not? i can't help anyone who cant help themselves.""  i told her ""fair assesment. i'll listen.""  she said ""i'm going to give you lexapro.""  i was like an ssri like zoloft?  her: ""slightly different.""  me: ""i'll just asssume as a professional you aren't steering me wrong.""   so now i'm on lexapro and i don't know how well it's working.  i still have no desire to interact with people outside of my wife and son. 

i wrote this post because i just got a message from my college professor ""friend"" that he is having a bbq on the 7th of may and wants me to come.  for a split second i was like yeah i'm on lexapro and i'll rise like a phoenix out of the ashes and become a better person and then during our conversation where i explained some of the issues i was having and then he said some condecending garbage about uneducated republican yokles are unbareable.  so i texted ""screw you and your barbeque you pretentious prick. lose my number.""  he replied. "" i'm sorry you feel this way,  i hope you get the help you deserve."" which made me roll my eyes and feel good about the decision i made.

so i'm back to square one. i hate everyone and the drugs aren't making me like people any more. i have burned all my bridges and am starting to affect my wife negatively.  

i feel like once someone is too far gone like me.  it's just better to become a hermit and limit social interaction. i'm thinking i should get a divorce let my wife have everything and i can move somewhere in the middle of nowhere.

Going medication free?,"i've been on medication for over 2 years to deal with the symptoms of bpd, and it's helped for sure. i started off with zoloft and seroquel, but changed those this year because of the side effect (weight gain and sexual dysfunction at low doses because i'm very sensitive to medication). i'm on lamotrigine and wellbutrin currently, but for the last while i've really been noticing the effect both or either one is having on my short-term memory. i'm forgetting things i never forgot before (putting away groceries, dinner i'm in the middle of prepping). it's just really a crappy thing to have to deal with.

as opposed to when i started medication i'm now in group schema therapy, dbt, and i have a private therapist. so there is definitely support there that wasn't there before. my question is whether anyone here has gone medication free 

disclaimer: i completely support the use of medication if it's working for you and the side effects are nonexistent or tolerable for you. this isn't me suddenly deciding that medication isn't worth it at all. i'm just really weighing up the side effects and the toll they've been taking on my life life, and it would help to know that there are people who have bpd who are genuinely treating it without medication and having success.

my shrink started treating me for bpd and started dbt with me but i left therapy shortly after and since then i have been kicking myself for it.

also has anyone here tried memantine? if so please do tell your experiences. i also have ocd that is evil and obsessional and i do still pick my skin multiple times a day and twist hair and have experienced minor psychosis in the past and had very bad hypochondria.

Other entities in your head... looking for someone who experiences what I experience.,"trigger warnings: self harm, suicidal ideation, childhood trauma, emotional and physical abuse, pedophilia. i do not go into explicit detail, but these themes are mentioned.

i posted this to r/did and the post was removed. i have also posted this to r/dpdr.

just for clarity: i do see a psychiatrist. i'm in therapy every week. i'm just looking for some information, i guess. someone who relates to me.

i'll be as brief as i can. i'm sorry it's sort of long anyways. i would really appreciate any feedback.

\------------------

relevant information: my aunt has did. there is not much other official history of mental illness in my family; one half is pentecostal religious, the other half has a strong history of drug abuse and suicide.

apparently, i had a traumatic childhood. every therapist i've had has told me i do not recognize the trauma i endured. to me it's all sort of funny, like a joke, like i didn't really experience any of it. my father was physically and emotionally abusive. he was very unpredictable. my mother was largely absent. when they divorced at age 10, my father convinced us that my mother did not love us, and that the devil was controlling her. i believed him.

when i was 13 an entity came to me. he was the ""invisible man"" i called him. he was outside of me, but i couldn't see him. he spoke to me through telepathy. he made me do things for him like hurt myself and leave one blind open on the windows so he could watch me while i sleep. he watched me at school through the eyes of other people. he told me people could read my mind and protected me by teaching me how to control my thoughts, to keep them safe. i also developed compulsions at this age which have never left.

his strictest rule was that i could never tell anyone about him. i told my dad once and he, being very religious, literally performed an exorcism on me with other members of the church to ""cast out the demons."" he has told me i used to see demons, i do not remember ever telling him that. my mom (divorced parents by that time) sent me to therapy because apparently i told her i was hearing voices-- i do not remember doing this. i refused to say a single word in therapy until the therapist cancelled our sessions.

the invisible man compelled me to interact with online pedophiles. i would video chat them graphic things. i gave them my phone number so they could talk to me late at night. it terrified me, but i had to. to this day, i go into what i call my ""turns""... very obsessive with graphic, illegal sexual things regarding murder and children. it horrifies me. i hate myself when these turns come on. it's like a beast inside me that gets let out occasionally.

by age 15 the invisible man had left. he successfully had taught me how to ""act normal"" as he put it and how to keep my thoughts safe. mind reading persisted.

at 19 i had what doctors called a psychotic break. i had delusions about david bowie. a new voice accompanied me and coached me through life, teaching me how to ""appear normal"" and how to ""not let anybody know you're crazy"" so that people didn't question me. i started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist.

around this time i started having blackouts. i have no idea what happened during this time. i would wake up in the same place i blacked out, though. however, i appear to have had blackouts in other times, too. apparently my brother and i had a conversation where i learned he was raped in the military. i have no recollection of that. i also started to have frequent episodes of ""mis-remembering"" things, where i would swear i'd spent a day doing something, only to find out that it hadn't happened. no clue what really happened. i remember times where i was hanging out with people downstairs, went upstairs for a moment, and came back downstairs to be told nobody had been over to the house. i never thought much about it.

age 20 i was diagnosed with schizophrenia, but they were never truly sure what was going on with me. at 22 they changed my diagnosis to a persistent anxiety disorder and ""other specified personality disorder"" (the three i matched criteria for are schizotypal pd, obsessive-compulsive pd, and borderline pd). even then, they made it clear to me that i don't really fit any criteria for a specific diagnosis. they're always confused about what's ""going on"" with me.

dissociation comes and go. i have described it as being a ""passenger"" in my body, watching myself go through the world with no real control over what i do. i often get what i call ""two feet back, two feet up"" where i am literally outside of my body watching me interact with others. since i was a young child, i would dissociate whenever i was in trouble with my dad. now it happens whenever i have any sort of serious conversation. i become a tiny peanut inside my body, and the world gets... larger. like i am one inch tall. everything appears massive, and i cannot feel my body. i feel like an ant inside a glass shell, looking out at the world, watching my mouth move in response. i also occasionally get 'confused' about which body is mine. for example, i'll be looking at another person's tattooed hands and genuinely think ""when did i get those tattoos?"" etc.

around age 20 i started abusing substances, namely marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol. i have been sober since october.

since last year, i have a new voice. his name is dexter. he tells me what other people are thinking, and what their intentions are. he says not to talk about him, or i will be gaslighted into thinking i'm ""crazy."" he protects me. he teaches me how to ""appear sane."" three weeks ago i broke his rules and told my clinicians about him. he got very angry. he made me cut myself--something i haven't done since i was a young teen. he told me to kill myself. he was very cruel to me, but he was doing it to help me. he told me exactly how to hurt myself so that others would believe me. ""if you don't do it 'this way,' they'll call you a faker."" the police were called on me, and i ran. i was able to avoid another hospitalization by staying with my mom and girlfriend.

earlier this week a new voice appeared. it was a female named mikkel. i had been seeing dexter's physical form for the first time (in my head)--he was picking up random weapons and trying to kill me. i was shocked and confused and fighting him off. then mikkel appeared. she was taunting me and calling me crazy. this upset dexter considerably. i just laid there and listened to them fight and fight and fight. they were visually fighting each other in my head as well. i had to ask her like ten times to even get a name out of her.

dexter has a very strong desire to be recognized by other people. both he and i want people to believe him. instead, i am gaslighted by my therapist and psychiatrist. my therapist recently called me delusional. dexter has an inhuman ability, and people are not willing to accept that. it's a frustrating position.

i take zoloft 150mg. i used to be on abilify 300ml injections, but i quit those in january. my psychiatrist wants me back on abilify because i recently had a manic episode in which i destroyed my car-- she was careful to point out that i don't have bipolar, though. i also take gabapentin 300mg, going up to 600mg next week.

thank you if you read this. the major point is that i feel compelled to believe and do what my voices tell me to do, and i often feel like the passenger, but i do not know what that means as far as ""what is going on with me."" i am unsure if this is psychosis, personality disorder, or something else. any feedback is very much appreciated. thanks again.",1559245152,False,BPD,2019-05-30 19:39:12,"Other entities in your head... looking for someone who experiences what I experience. trigger warnings: self harm, suicidal ideation, childhood trauma, emotional and physical abuse, pedophilia. i do not go into explicit detail, but these themes are mentioned.

Zoloft and Possible BPD Rage?,"hi everyone, 

i believe my boyfriend has bpd, he has been diagnosed with manic depressive in the past but bpd seems more realistic to his symptoms. he is also in outpatient detox for heroin, and while he is detoxing from this, his medical plan includes zoloft, he just started this week, and three days ago he had an explosive bpd rage. i have been with him for 3 years and i've never ever seen him like this. he was more depressed than i've ever seen him, he tried to commit suicide that night several times, wielded a knife from the kitchen and was even terrifyingly verbally abusive to me and mother. i want to know if anyone had any situations with zoloft. also, he had about two glasses of bacardi that night after taking his zoloft.

"ANTIDEPRESSANTS(zoloft) HELPED ME BIG TIME!! and I figured out WHY it helps too, so please read if you are suffering, you do not deserve to do this alone","hello! 

i had a very eye-opening experience where **i accidentally tricked my bpd into falling into it's own trap and finally releasing my poor hostage-held personality** *was always right there.*

i know that without the sertraline/zoloft(ssri's) there's a good chance i'd still be stuck in this indescribable hell of a bpd brain.

i know there can be a stigma, but please hear me out. this came from a very genuine place in my heart **that i am for the first time proud to call a part of my personality**. this thread has been an enormous help and i want to give something back. i would never have felt confident enough in my own advice or experience help but fuck nothing to lose i just want y'all to see how beautiful you are. nothing to lose, for real. just time and a whole lot of energy. 

&amp;#x200b;

i have written this as entertainingly as possible and it includes a water break. ready? let's goooooo don't let my 6 hours go to waste 

&amp;#x200b;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


i feel like not enough people realise that these meds really really really effectively **helped** me. helped in bold because i want to empathise that ad's are not a cure, you do all the work yourself. but i do think the effect of ssri's **make it a lot easier to have faith in your own abilities and intelligence.**

 i'm now on month 1 and a half of 50 mg sertraline and no, it doesn't take away my intense emotions, but that's a good thing. it feels like this is how non-npd people might experience emotions, to a certain degree except i am very aware of all my normal-person achievements. *...which makes me laugh because i kind of imagine myself as an alien in kids movies but the heart warming type where the alien blends in awkwardly but in the end everything turned out okay.. don't make me explain this. let your imagination do the work*. ( do not convince me that you don't have imagination, because you sure as hell do. **because you are definitely creative to compare yourself to a ""funhouse mirror"",** *which was probably one of the most beautiful, creative and dark comparisons i have ever read and definitely felt.* t was one of y'all, you know who you are.)

 i think we all need to slow down for a minute and see the potential our intensity and passion has. and by that, i mean the **genuinity**, the **caring**, the **passion** etc. apply it however you like, but i think first we need to kind of **realise that this is actually possible**. i read so so much about how hopeless and life-long this ""disease"" of ours is, but that people can learn to deal with it with intensive life long therapy.. i don't know about you, but that doesn't exactly get me pumped to live when i am that lost.

i am surprised how little people talk about what happens when they turn their energy the other way. you might think there is no other way, but i think there is a very big chance that there is a **you** that you would fp instantly if you met **you** doing the things you love to do and because **your** mind is beautiful.  yeah that sentence sucks to read in so many ways ..

 right now i'm just kind of seeing my borderline as my kung fu master and that one tiny crumb of self worth is like yoda or whatever but he was asleep and the zoloft just tells him ' *yo wake up. give that student a little peptalk he went through some shit.'* make sure i '*use the force wisely'*... probably remind me of some armour and weapon i discarded because i thought it sucked compared to other people's armour. oh **hey turns out there's no war and you live in a pretty peaceful village**

&amp;#x200b;

right back to the point before i get too carried away and you're all going to stop taking me seriously...

..and i really want you to take this seriously and feel personally spoken to because i honestly think we need to hear this kind of thing more. and **we need to keep reminding ourselves as much as others because** **i don't think anyone can flip our switch like people we trust to know the extent of our pain**. at least feel like you are able to save people's lives this way. **it's kind of the only thing that allowed me to come near that switch because i didn't value my own life enough for it to be worth working on.** 

so i think what makes this one different from every other manic""breakthrough"" i've had, is that i realised that my empathy skills also worked on all of you here, combined with my overly-dramatic feelings of responsibility and most importantly projecting(this mf is the sneaky killer i swear to god), resulting in a fucking mind-hack. **i feel like i punched that one asshole-bully in the face because i realised i have giant fists all along and the bully was dumber than i thought.**

&amp;#x200b;

*//intermezzo// hello, loyal bpd human. i admire your devotion for having gotten this far. drink some h2o //intermezzo over//*

&amp;#x200b;

so anyway,,, now that i polised both our ego's nice for us to bear with me a little longer, i will try to get back to the point i wanted to make.

&amp;#x200b;

i'll try to summarize how i got to the point where the docs suggested it and what got me to give in to therapy that i didn't even think i needed but would probably have ended up addicted and probably in a lot of pain in many more ways.

&amp;#x200b;

this all happened after a very intense 2 year relationship in a foreign country after impulsively having traveled the world in a frantic attempt to find comfort in the feeling of not belonging by escaping society and directing my deep-rooted anger towards humanity as a whole. actually managed pretty well there thanks to a nice an reliable supply of people appreciating my presence because of my enthousiasm and genuinity. of course, over time after idealising the first best thing away from home that i had demonised, i impulsively moved there and stayed there for a year before the owners of the place were question why i was still there and i inturn once again question my entire existance, let alone self-worth which was entirely based on how useful and liked i was by these people. visited a city, fp'd the hell out of a very unlucky fella, messed up both our minds worse than i'd like to admit, along with all the people i involved during my big performance, pushed the boy out the house, appearantly out the city, country and over the ocean and straight into therapy. wise boy. i at the time was still highly convinced he was the ultimate narcissist and i abused my freedom by abusing drugs. jokes on me i'm not actually that tough and taking it way too far, having the worst come-down of my life combined with this facade of telling myself i'm better off without him, i called my parents that i am not okay and told them what happened. you can probably fill in the rest based on the fact that i'm writing this now. 

skipping the nightmare that is everything that comes before you finally get your therapy and then diagnosis after probably a total of 15 weeks. i got diagnosed with bpd, anxiety, ptss, with a nice finishing touch of crippling depression that developed over time when i could not move on to the next life and all i had was the worst version of myself and no distractions aka people. hell, i had already decided the next life was not gonna happen for me before my therapists put me on zoloft(sertraline). 

 this particular type of ad was chosen for me because helps a lot with the anxiety that often comes with bpd. 

it especially helps dig out that part of you, that knows better but gets fully overtaken and ends up overruled by this big ol cloud of self loathing. it fucking spirals man.

only once i started to be able to be a bit kinder to myself whilst recognising i have this disorder ( thankfully one of my obsessions is understanding people and finally myself too) i felt no reason not to allow myself a fucking break rather than destroying myself. i have made a hobby almost out of figuring this disorder and different mood and anxiety disorders, without feeling personally attacked or worthless for having them.

 i get why i have this, but for the first time i don't feel sorry for myself or hate myself and expect others to fix it because 'i do so much for others', but i actually feel good about myself and see the good traits this bpd brings. i feel confident enough actually take responsibility. **i think all of us have fucked up serotonin receptors ( we associate happiness with the wrong stuff bruh ),** and the biggest difference it made was experiencing that happiness doing the right things. things that i'm proudly starting associate with!, without my bpdbrain immediately seeing all the negativity in everything and especially myself.

you can look up what ssri's do if you don't know, but understanding how they work it makes so much sense to how it affects the way you look at things. i am so motivated to understand myself and others a lot clearer and i'm actually **benefitting** from years of being extremely awful to myself **by realising i'm a really genuine**, passionate, creative, funny person! i had to be good at everything but i did not see it if i was at all. 

i know it can sound like i feel like i am better than people and some might accuse me of npd. i think that's fair, i definitely suspected myself of it and tried to convince myself i have it. but really it feels like now that i really understand the disorder i feel like i have no excuse to feel sorry for myself because it's a dead end. it feels hopeful because i feel like i'm part of this world and if i'm confident and what works best is to own everything i am, even if that means i say kind of inappropriate things. i would laugh if someone made that joke and if they don't they're missing out on a lot of quality entertainment, for sure.. i make a concious effort not to try and  mandanouvre myself around myself i get out of being stuck and the well known snow-ball of self hatred, confusion and regret. 

when i realised this, recognising where patterns started, everything really got a lot easier and i'm feeling this sensation of remembering myself as a person who enjoys life. and trust me, i was convinced i do everything based on what might be desirable for people. yeah, maybe my trauma's influenced that growing up, but that's not my fault and i can't turn back time and replace my parents and surroundings, just like i can't now. what i can do is work with what  got, and that's a whole lot more than you want to admit, which is definitely the case in all you fucking incredible human beings.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

 and **now i can finally see that that's pretty cool and that being super sensitive to everything can be amazing. the connections with people i make can be so beautiful, and positively use you can really make a great positive impact on other people's lives**, if that's something you care about. i figured out what i actually care about and i got a shit ton closer to my personality.

i feel like not enough people realise that these meds really really really effectively **helped** me. helped in bold because i want to empathise that ad's are not a cure, you do all the work yourself. but i do think the effect of ssri's **make it a lot easier to have faith in your own abilities and intelligence.**

 i'm now on month 1 and a half of 50 mg sertraline and no, it doesn't take away my intense emotions, but that's a good thing. it feels like this is how non-npd people might experience emotions, to a certain degree except i am very aware of all my normal-person achievements. *...which makes me laugh because i kind of imagine myself as an alien in kids movies but the heart warming type where the alien blends in awkwardly but in the end everything turned out okay.. don't make me explain this. let your imagination do the work*. ( do not convince me that you don't have imagination, because you sure as hell do. **because you are definitely creative to compare yourself to a ""funhouse mirror"",** *which was probably one of the most beautiful, creative and dark comparisons i have ever read and definitely felt.* t was one of y'all, you know who you are.)

 i think we all need to slow down for a minute and see the potential our intensity and passion has. and by that, i mean the **genuinity**, the **caring**, the **passion** etc. apply it however you like, but i think first we need to kind of **realise that this is actually possible**. i read so so much about how hopeless and life-long this ""disease"" of ours is, but that people can learn to deal with it with intensive life long therapy.. i don't know about you, but that doesn't exactly get me pumped to live when i am that lost.

i am surprised how little people talk about what happens when they turn their energy the other way. you might think there is no other way, but i think there is a very big chance that there is a **you** that you would fp instantly if you met **you** doing the things you love to do and because **your** mind is beautiful.  yeah that sentence sucks to read in so many ways ..

 right now i'm just kind of seeing my borderline as my kung fu master and that one tiny crumb of self worth is like yoda or whatever but he was asleep and the zoloft just tells him ' *yo wake up. give that student a little peptalk he went through some shit.'* make sure i '*use the force wisely'*... probably remind me of some armour and weapon i discarded because i thought it sucked compared to other people's armour. oh **hey turns out there's no war and you live in a pretty peaceful village**

&amp;#x200b;

right back to the point before i get too carried away and you're all going to stop taking me seriously...

..and i really want you to take this seriously and feel personally spoken to because i honestly think we need to hear this kind of thing more. and **we need to keep reminding ourselves as much as others because** **i don't think anyone can flip our switch like people we trust to know the extent of our pain**. at least feel like you are able to save people's lives this way. **it's kind of the only thing that allowed me to come near that switch because i didn't value my own life enough for it to be worth working on.** 

so i think what makes this one different from every other manic""breakthrough"" i've had, is that i realised that my empathy skills also worked on all of you here, combined with my overly-dramatic feelings of responsibility and most importantly projecting(this mf is the sneaky killer i swear to god), resulting in a fucking mind-hack. **i feel like i punched that one asshole-bully in the face because i realised i have giant fists all along and the bully was dumber than i thought.**

&amp;#x200b;

*//intermezzo// hello, loyal bpd human. i admire your devotion for having gotten this far. drink some h2o //intermezzo over//*

&amp;#x200b;

so anyway,,, now that i polised both our ego's nice for us to bear with me a little longer, i will try to get back to the point i wanted to make.

&amp;#x200b;

i'll try to summarize how i got to the point where the docs suggested it and what got me to give in to therapy that i didn't even think i needed but would probably have ended up addicted and probably in a lot of pain in many more ways.

&amp;#x200b;

this all happened after a very intense 2 year relationship in a foreign country after impulsively having traveled the world in a frantic attempt to find comfort in the feeling of not belonging by escaping society and directing my deep-rooted anger towards humanity as a whole. actually managed pretty well there thanks to a nice an reliable supply of people appreciating my presence because of my enthousiasm and genuinity. of course, over time after idealising the first best thing away from home that i had demonised, i impulsively moved there and stayed there for a year before the owners of the place were question why i was still there and i inturn once again question my entire existance, let alone self-worth which was entirely based on how useful and liked i was by these people. visited a city, fp'd the hell out of a very unlucky fella, messed up both our minds worse than i'd like to admit, along with all the people i involved during my big performance, pushed the boy out the house, appearantly out the city, country and over the ocean and straight into therapy. wise boy. i at the time was still highly convinced he was the ultimate narcissist and i abused my freedom by abusing drugs. jokes on me i'm not actually that tough and taking it way too far, having the worst come-down of my life combined with this facade of telling myself i'm better off without him, i called my parents that i am not okay and told them what happened. you can probably fill in the rest based on the fact that i'm writing this now. 

skipping the nightmare that is everything that comes before you finally get your therapy and then diagnosis after probably a total of 15 weeks. i got diagnosed with bpd, anxiety, ptss, with a nice finishing touch of crippling depression that developed over time when i could not move on to the next life and all i had was the worst version of myself and no distractions aka people. hell, i had already decided the next life was not gonna happen for me before my therapists put me on zoloft(sertraline). 

 this particular type of ad was chosen for me because helps a lot with the anxiety that often comes with bpd. 

it especially helps dig out that part of you, that knows better but gets fully overtaken and ends up overruled by this big ol cloud of self loathing. it fucking spirals man.

only once i started to be able to be a bit kinder to myself whilst recognising i have this disorder ( thankfully one of my obsessions is understanding people and finally myself too) i felt no reason not to allow myself a fucking break rather than destroying myself. i have made a hobby almost out of figuring this disorder and different mood and anxiety disorders, without feeling personally attacked or worthless for having them.

 i get why i have this, but for the first time i don't feel sorry for myself or hate myself and expect others to fix it because 'i do so much for others', but i actually feel good about myself and see the good traits this bpd brings. i feel confident enough actually take responsibility. **i think all of us have fucked up serotonin receptors ( we associate happiness with the wrong stuff bruh ),** and the biggest difference it made was experiencing that happiness doing the right things. things that i'm proudly starting associate with!, without my bpdbrain immediately seeing all the negativity in everything and especially myself.

you can look up what ssri's do if you don't know, but understanding how they work it makes so much sense to how it affects the way you look at things. i am so motivated to understand myself and others a lot clearer and i'm actually **benefitting** from years of being extremely awful to myself **by realising i'm a really genuine**, passionate, creative, funny person! i had to be good at everything but i did not see it if i was at all. 

i know it can sound like i feel like i am better than people and some might accuse me of npd. i think that's fair, i definitely suspected myself of it and tried to convince myself i have it. but really it feels like now that i really understand the disorder i feel like i have no excuse to feel sorry for myself because it's a dead end. it feels hopeful because i feel like i'm part of this world and if i'm confident and what works best is to own everything i am, even if that means i say kind of inappropriate things. i would laugh if someone made that joke and if they don't they're missing out on a lot of quality entertainment, for sure.. i make a concious effort not to try and  mandanouvre myself around myself i get out of being stuck and the well known snow-ball of self hatred, confusion and regret. 

when i realised this, recognising where patterns started, everything really got a lot easier and i'm feeling this sensation of remembering myself as a person who enjoys life. and trust me, i was convinced i do everything based on what might be desirable for people. yeah, maybe my trauma's influenced that growing up, but that's not my fault and i can't turn back time and replace my parents and surroundings, just like i can't now. what i can do is work with what  got, and that's a whole lot more than you want to admit, which is definitely the case in all you fucking incredible human beings.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

 and **now i can finally see that that's pretty cool and that being super sensitive to everything can be amazing. the connections with people i make can be so beautiful, and positively use you can really make a great positive impact on other people's lives**, if that's something you care about. i figured out what i actually care about and i got a shit ton closer to my personality.

I’ve been suicidal for 5 days straight and I don’t like what to do,"this is my first post and it’s going to be pretty long so bear with me. i’m 21 and i’m an aircraft mechanic in the air force who was just diagnosed with bpd about two to three months ago. getting diagnosed helped me a lot with understanding why i am the way that i am. i’m currently in the process of getting a medical discharge from the military because i was hospitalized in inpatient facilities 3 times in the second half of 2020 and they’re deeming me unfit for duty. 

i’ve been abandoned by everyone in my life except for my one friend from high school and a friend i have who’s also in the military but i feel like it’s just a matter of time before they leave too. i can’t keep going through this. i was talking to this girl for a week and a half and we hung out every single one of those days, and i get attached super easily because i cling onto any sort of affection, which i’m sure comes with bpd (i’m still learning about it). within that week and a half she definitely became my fp and she seemed like the perfect person for me. on friday she told me she doesn’t think it’d be healthy if we dated because she also has bpd and she said that we both need to learn better ways to cope. i felt like her also having bpd would be better because she could understand more what i’m going through but i guess she didn’t agree. this obviously crushed me because i felt abandoned once again by a fp and it’s so fucking painful. she said she wasn’t gonna abandon me because she understands how it feels and she sat with me for a while when i broke down after she told me that. she still messages me sometimes but it’s not the same. she also just got back with her ex this past weekend who treated her like shit and i just want her to be treated right plus that made things extra hard on me. 

obviously this was really hard but this triggered a bunch of other stuff as well. like it made me feel like i’m undeserving of love and i’ll never be able to be loved. i don’t think i’ve ever actually felt love but i do believe in it because of how i love. i feel like its very unlikely but i want to find someone who can love the same way i do. i thought it would be this girl because from what i can tell she loves the same way but i guess it’s not. a big reason why i feel that i’ll never feel love is because i don’t know if i could ever be with someone without bpd because they won’t understand what i’m going through and most of my past relationships have ended and i’ve been abandoned due to me being clingy or they think i’m overreacting over something. i’m really not sure if i could do it because having this disorder always pushes people away. apparently i can’t be with someone with bpd either because it’d be too toxic. i feel like i’m just destined to be alone forever which i definitely cannot handle. 

i’ve hated myself for a while but i feel like this triggered me to hate myself even more because it made me hate that i have this mental illness, even more then i did before. it’s ruined almost every relationship i’ve been in because it’ll cause me to be too clingy or overreact over minor things (like getting left on read or ignored), and it ruined the chance of this one because she didn’t think it’d be healthy since we both have it. i also tried having sex with this girl and i couldn’t perform. my doctor said the ed was most likely due to a combination of the medications and the mental health issues. they prescribed me viagra which really fucking sucks because i’m 21, i feel like i shouldn’t need to take that. the girl i was talking to was very understanding and accepting of it but it just makes me hate myself and the mental illnesses i have even more. i hate myself for it every single day and i can’t ever imagine it getting better. i can’t envision the future at all, especially not a future where i’d feel happy because i can’t remember the last time i felt genuine happiness, it’s definitely been many years. i should be getting discharged from the military within 6 months and i have no clue what i’m gonna do because i didn’t really expect to live this long and i’m still not really sure if i’ll still be alive at that point.

i literally don’t know what to do. this happened friday and i’ve been very suicidal ever since. not just because i got abandoned by a fp again (that was a big part of it) but because of the other things it triggered as well. there have been times within the past few days where the suicidal thoughts weren’t as bad as others but for the most part it’s been consistently bad and i’m so very close to just giving up. i’ve been suicidal every single day since july 2020 but it was usually only for a short period of time besides the times i ended up in the hospital. it’s just continuing to get worse and the past few days have been really bad. 

i can’t even do my job effectively because i’m in so much emotional pain and i don’t know what to do. that’s really hard on me because it makes me feel extremely useless. i’m also afraid it’s gonna be the same at my next job after the military and it’ll end up getting me fired. 

i’m on two different anti depressants (450mg wellbutrin and 150mg zoloft) as well as 10mg adderall since i just got diagnosed with adhd, i’ve been doing therapy for a year and a half and i was hospitalized 3 times but all of that literally has done nothing for me. they’re taking about prescribing me a mood stabilizer which i’m willing to try if it’ll help even a little bit because i can’t keep living like this. 

i’ve thought about going to a therapist who specializes in bpd where i can do dbt because that’s the only thing i can think of that’d possibly help but i’d have to pay for it out of pocket because the military doesn’t cover it and the military therapists aren’t really doing anything for me. i know bpd is incurable but it’s possible to learn how to cope with it. it scares me that i’m going to be struggling with this for the rest of my life. i’ve heard learning to cope with bpd can take years even with putting a lot of effort into it. that also terrifies me because i can’t go that long while still feeling like this and it makes me really want to give up. 

i’m just so done with everything, like i said in the title i’ve been suicidal for the past 5 days nonstop and there’s nothing that’s helping. i’ve tried distracting myself by listening to music, working on my cars, and driving around but nothing is working. i so badly want to just give up so because i can’t live with this pain anymore but i’m so scared that i’m going to fail and end up back in the hospital since that just makes things worse because i feel trapped.

i don’t know if anything can be done and i feel like it can’t but if anyone has any ideas please let me know. i apologize for such a long post but i don’t really have anyone to go to for actual help and i can’t keep going on like this and continuing to get abandoned. i just don’t know what to do.",1615928330,False,BPD,2021-03-16 20:58:50,"I’ve been suicidal for 5 days straight and I don’t like what to do this is my first post and it’s going to be pretty long so bear with me. i’m 21 and i’m an aircraft mechanic in the air force who was just diagnosed with bpd about two to three months ago. getting diagnosed helped me a lot with understanding why i am the way that i am. i’m currently in the process of getting a medical discharge from the military because i was hospitalized in inpatient facilities 3 times in the second half of 2020 and they’re deeming me unfit for duty.

Buspirone + Amitriptyline,"hi everyone. i suffer with bpd since i was little and my mum has it too. last year my mental health deteriorated, i got divorced with my narcissistic husband and i also quit my job because my racist boss treated me like a slave. i was prescribed sertraline and was sent to an emdr therapy which didn’t really help. sertraline made me suicidal and caused chronic bladder pain so i stopped taking it. then i changed a doctor and asked for buspirone. i took 5mg in the morning for few weeks but i didn’t have any side effects so the doctor put me on it twice a day. i felt tiny bit less anxious and i didn’t have panic attacks anymore but i was still worrying all the time. later on i developed back pain and pelvic pain and in march doc added 10mg amitriptyline. i’ve noticed the difference straight away. it’s been almost a month taking both and i feel like a different person. i’m happy every single day, my brain stopped plotting bad things, i finally have a filter, my thoughts are so much more positive, i stopped worrying, i stopped starting fights and breaking up with my boyfriend every week, i stopped hurting him and calling him bad things, i’m not jealous anymore, i’m not obsessed anymore, i’m not even bothered about cleaning so much like i always did. i feel more myself than ever, i don’t feel numb at all and i still have crazy high sex drive. i can finally concentrate on being in love rather then my crazy, vicious thoughts. life is great!",1588236822,False,BPD,2020-04-30 08:53:42,"Buspirone + Amitriptyline hi everyone. i suffer with bpd since i was little and my mum has it too. last year my mental health deteriorated, i got divorced with my narcissistic husband and i also quit my job because my racist boss treated me like a slave. i was prescribed sertraline and was sent to an emdr therapy which didn’t really help. sertraline made me suicidal and caused chronic bladder pain so i stopped taking it. then i changed a doctor and asked for buspirone. i took 5mg in the morning for few weeks but i didn’t have any side effects so the doctor put me on it twice a day. i felt tiny bit less anxious and i didn’t have panic attacks anymore but i was still worrying all the time. later on i developed back pain and pelvic pain and in march doc added 10mg amitriptyline. i’ve noticed the difference straight away. it’s been almost a month taking both and i feel like a different person. i’m happy every single day, my brain stopped plotting bad things, i finally have a filter, my thoughts are so much more positive, i stopped worrying, i stopped starting fights and breaking up with my boyfriend every week, i stopped hurting him and calling him bad things, i’m not jealous anymore, i’m not obsessed anymore, i’m not even bothered about cleaning so much like i always did. i feel more myself than ever, i don’t feel numb at all and i still have crazy high sex drive. i can finally concentrate on being in love rather then my crazy, vicious thoughts. life is great!",buspirone amitriptyline hi everyone suffer bpd since little mum last year mental health deteriorated got divorced narcissistic husband also quit job racist bos treated like slave prescribed sertraline sent emdr therapy didn’t really help sertraline made suicidal caused chronic bladder pain stopped taking changed doctor asked buspirone took 5mg morning week didn’t side effect doctor put twice day felt tiny bit le anxious didn’t panic attack anymore still worrying time later developed back pain pelvic pain march doc added 10mg amitriptyline i’ve noticed difference straight away it’s almost month taking feel like different person i’m happy every single day brain stopped plotting bad thing finally filter thought much positive stopped worrying stopped starting fight breaking boyfriend every week stopped hurting calling bad thing i’m jealous anymore i’m obsessed anymore i’m even bothered cleaning much like always feel ever don’t feel numb still crazy high sex drive finally concentrate love rather crazy vicious thought life great,0.8907103938309594,"['Amitriptyline', 'Buspirone', 'Sertraline']","```json

In and out of crisis mode; could new medication be causing this?,"background: i was on 50mg of zoloft from early december to january 11th. at first, it really seemed like this was the answer. it was the first time i had taken medication of any kind, but the effects started to fade and i began having swings again. 

psychiatrist put me on 100mg of zoloft on january 11th. for the next two months, it made my life so much worse. i developed agoraphobia for about three weeks. i was so much more prone to lashing out on my boyfriend. i even cut myself for the first time in three years, though i was drunk when it happened. 

this monday, i finally got an appointment in to see my psychiatrist. i'm being tapered off the zoloft and switching to  37.5mg of effexor. psychiatrist said she wants to increase to 75 when the time comes. i've been swinging pretty violently for the past four days, with today being the worst and most extreme. i woke up after having bizarre and vivid dreams with a generally negative undertone. felt sunshiney and happy being that the weather is nice and i went to go get coffee and breakfast. 

around 4 pm, i swung violently into panic and withdraw mode. i was splitting, but not lashing out and ended up going on a walk with my boyfriend where i was crying and shaking and too afraid to mention that i was upset to him. not that he would yell at me, but i knew i wasn't being rational and would suffocate him for affirmation after affirmation. i thought i was dying.

felt okay after about ten minutes of that, so it was some sort of panic attack. then i leveled out for a bit and watched saved by the bell. fifteen minutes ago i felt the dread in my chest again. i'm withdrawing and feel isolating and unloved. my boyfriend left the room to talk to his mother and i started sobbing. 

i have no idea what could be causing this. my doctor won't be in until monday, my talk therapist leaves at 6 pm everyday, and my art therapist may be in, but it's a friday. it does feel like i keep going in and out of crisis mode. i just want my life to feel normal again.

Anyone else have anger issues?,"so for about a year i was on zoloft (100mg) and i smoked pot almost constantly. after spending the whole summer apathetic and suicidal i decided to quit zoloft. (i reduced myself to 50mg at the start of summer because it gave me heartburn and 25mg a week ago.) i've also basically stopped smoking because it cost too much.

before being medicated i had serious anger issues and when they more or less vanished (when i'm high it's basically impossible to make me mad) i thought i'd just grown older and learned to manage it. (there was a period between the anger and the medication where i was in a toxic relationship and i was too busy being sad to get angry.) obviously i was wrong and the zoloft was just muffling it.

i've never had a therapist. i went to one, he told me i was really weird (exact words, maybe he didn't believe me, idk) and referred me to a psychiatric who diagnosed me with bdp and prescribed me the zoloft. 

how common is anger issues in bdp? i've always been a fairly angry person (discounting this last year) . i don't usually blow up at people--i may snap at them if they're the direct cause of my anger--but it's more like i've got a hive of angry bees ready to swarm the weakest target and i'm just containing them till i can be alone.

Fiance and treating her BPD,"good morning everyone,

i have been with my fiance for 6 years and she has been diagnosed with bpd since we started dating. i will say, in comparison to what a lot of others deal with in there circumstances with bpd, my fiance does well with coping with it.

however, my fiance is currently in school for her masters and working a full time job as a registered behavior technician and the last couple weeks her bpd has been flaring up really bad. she wakes up each morning afraid to go to work because she feels like everyone at work hates her and she is going to ruin everything we have worked for over the last 6 years. i think it is to the point where she will need to take therapy and possibly medication. however, all of her therapists in the past have not been helpful to her. some even playing into her paranoia by saying things like, ""what if they really are lying to you? what if you are reading them correctly and they really don't like you?"" which has affected the way she views therapy and doesn't want to put the energy into trying it again with a new therapist.

in regards to medication, she has been prescribed things quickly by past psychiatrists including hydroxyzine, zoloft, and klonopin. i think the past psychiatrists just prescribed her something without truly understanding what she needs. i think she needs something along the lines of an anti-psychotic to help balance her mood swings and clear up the intrusive thoughts in her head (everyone hates me, i ruin everything, i hurt everyone i come in contact with).

i am just seeking some advice on how i can go about talking to her about it without overwhelming her. i just want her to feel ok and stable and i thought that asking others who struggle with it would be able to help me find the best way to reassure her that it is going to be beneficial for her. i appreciate any help.",1638201194,False,BPD,2021-11-29 15:53:14,"Fiance and treating her BPD good morning everyone,

recently my life has gone to shit, and as usual, i can really only blame myself. it's been exactly two years since my suicide attempt/hospitalisation, and i'm afraid i feel another crisis impending. so i did the responsible thing today, went to the doctors, and he prescribed me a new round of zoloft, upping the dosage from 50 to 100mg a day, and stressed i keep up with the prescription.

my question is, how helpful has zoloft been for those of you taking it to assist with relieving bpd symptoms? side effects, both short and long term? how does it compare with other ssris you may have been put on?

Trying medication - UK,"hello,

i'm 30/f, had bpd 10+ years but was probably diagnosed 2013?

i've relapsed recently due to a bad break up and i'm not looking after myself - not sleeping, not eating (lost a lot of weight), crying between work meetings (wfh) and struggling to see the meaning in everything. considering si. exercise, workbooks etc aren't working and the waiting list for therapy is long. i know it takes me a long time to get over someone so when my gp suggested medication today i was open to it.

last time i tried it, i tried sertraline for a few months about 6 years ago. it made me feel very speedy with strange rushed thoughts in the morning (on a low dose) so i decided to stop it.

my current gp's suggestions are sertraline or citalopram. can anyone recommend anything else for me to research? i doubt they will give me benzos and i'm worried about being left flat with ssris. i'm in the uk - thank you x",1621515672,False,BPD,2021-05-20 13:01:12,"Trying medication - UK hello,

living with borderline: challenges and victories,"tw: self-harm, substance abuse, eds and suicide

my mental health journey has not always been easy. in fact, many people who suffer from mental illnesses are afraid to reach out for help for many reasons - stigma being a main one. up until now, i have lived my life in shame and confusion, not knowing what was wrong with me.
i wanted to share my story with this amazing community, because i do feel like i need some guidance from more experienced “sufferers”. 

my problems have started in my childhood, around the age of 8-9 years old. i think i always had some struggles, but i never externalised them in a healthy way. my life at home was not the greatest and i was living in quite an unstable environment. i was never abused in any way, but my relationship with my parents has always been difficult. i come from a pretty affluent family, so most of the fights were about money (surprisingly). my mom is a pretty difficult person to live with, i won’t lie. she has always been a high maintenance person and she always focused on her appearance, so the way in which society perceived her was always important to her. my dad was mostly absent, because he was gone on business trips and was always working late. also, even though my parents had an extremely dysfunctional relationship, they still managed to travel the world - for this reason, i pretty much grew up around nannies. my parents had a long and complicated divorce, mainly because they were fighting about their assets. 

after their divorce was finalised, i started elementary school. right from that time, i always felt misunderstood by my peers and wasn’t really getting along with anyone. i always thought that it was wrong, because i saw myself as superior to others and felt discriminated that by the treatment that i received fron those around me. most people thought that i was mean and spoiled, which wreaked havoc on my self-esteem. i reminded myself that this issue could pass and i would finally show who i truly was - in all honesty, this never really happened and i have always been marginalised by children of the same age.

also, because i never felt normal, i behaved in such way. i had intense mood swings and every inconvenience fueled me with rage - thus, i spent most of the time screaming for hours on end. i had these episodes in public spaces, thefefore i never really experienced shame and was unfazed of the reactions that strangers gave whenever i had these long fits of anger. i have verbally and physically abused my parents when i was younger, which i am not proud of. keep in mind, all of these problems could not have been understood by a child, i didn’t know any better. i am a little bit more able to control my anger in some instances, but these mood swings are affecting my life greatly. i also formed a habit of spending large amounts of money - stealing money from my parents’ wallets, searching for money in the house, maxing out my parent’s credit cards and so on. i am a really impulsive person, so that coudl be an explanation for my toxic behaviour. this impulsivity has led me to abuse drugs sometimes - although it never developed into a full blown addiction. for example, when i was in 9th grade, i took a shit ton of ativan and combined it with alcohol (a full bottle of wine). i still don’t know how i didn’t die, guess someone must have really wanted me alive. not gonna lie, i would try almost any drug (maybe to fill the void inside or to feel something other than sadness and rage).

i think that the paragraphs above were written in too much detail, so i will try to write more about my current struggles. i started using self distructive coping mechanisms from when i was really young, but i started to cut myself from 5th grade. from my thighs to my arms, they are all covered with scars. i also have an unhealthy relationship with food (recovered bulimic) and i can never eat with someone around me, always alone - not even with closest friends or parents. i also have a tendency of hiding food inside my room for days. i really need help, i feel like i am on the verge of insanity. i cannot get out of bed to shower, i haven’t done that in about a week. i haven’t brushed my teeth in three weeks. i cannot go out of my house to take walks, because it makes me exhausted. i also have pretty weird feelings, like someone is always out to get me. i was always afraid that my dad was going to rape me (even though he was never abusive and never laid a finger on me) or that video cameras were installed in the house so that i could be watched. when walking on the street, i had a feeling that everyone was looking at me and talking about me or even that i was going to be kidnapped and murdered by strangers. it’s pretty hard to think that i will ever get better and be able to function. after a long depressive episode, i finally reached for help. the first psychiatrist refused to treat me because of my bpd and sent me to a mental hospital instead. the second one thought that my problems were not that extreme and that i was just making them up. however, the third one was really understanding and compassionate, which helped me gain some faith back. upon receiving my bpd diagnosis, i felt that a great weight has been lifted off my shoulders. i finally felt that all of my problems had an explanation and that i wasn’t just imagining it. i was put on zoloft, which fucked me up. along with the side effects, my suicidal thoughts became more intense and i attempted suicide for the first time last month. i was out of ativan, so i tried to slit my wrists - and my three huge vertical scars are there to remind me every day of it, they never fail. 

all in all, i am finally starting therapy and i will also switch my medication (mood stabiliser and possibly a low dose of antipsychotics). i am sorry that i wrote so much, but my mind is not in the right place and i am in a time of crisis. i would greatly appreciate it if anyone could give me some tips on how i can adjust to medication, be more receptive to therapy or just learn how to cope better with this condition. i would also like to apologise if my writing is somewhat incoherent, but i am really not okay and struggling very badly. if anyone would like to know more about my symptoms or background, don’t be afraid to ask. i still have many other things that i wasn’t able to write about here - as it was getting too long and tiring. thank you for taking time out of your day to read this ❤️",1592508304,True,BPD,2020-06-18 19:25:04,"living with borderline: challenges and victories tw: self-harm, substance abuse, eds and suicide

I’ve been off my medications for a few months and I’m finally starting to have a psychotic breakdown..once again.,"for a couple of years i was on mirtazapine (remeron) 40mg and olanzapine (zyprexa) 5-7mg. 
i also have bipolar ii and chronic ptsd. 
i got off of my meds like a month after we moved into our new place 09/24/2019. and so far up until now i have felt amazing. little to no depression, handling stressful situations rationally, no fearing of abandonment, minimal arguments with my so and really helping my kids make better grades in school. 

but for the last few weeks i have been sleeping in from the time i put my kids on the bus until it is time to get them off of the bus. today i actually woke up and cleaned my home. may have been motivated to do so because my boyfriends mom came over to spend the afternoon with us, so i’m not sure if i should be proud of myself or not for being somewhat productive after all these weeks. 

my moms birthday and wedding anniversary just passed (she’s deceased) and that kind of ruffled up some feelings, my boyfriend and i have been having some communication and intimacy issues. 

some things i have noticed in the last week or two is that i have become really hyper sexual, thinking a lot more rapidly, i can’t sleep at night, paranoia more frequently, crying since valentine’s day, and i keep wanting to act impulsively. yesterday i stole something from the store for the second time in my life and it was so thrilling that i feel like doing it again but with more risk. i haven’t self harmed in a long time and i don’t have sex often and those were the two things i turned to when i was having some kind of adrenaline rush. now it’s like i want to do more to fill that need. i sprained my wrist and instead of taking the pain pills for my arm i’ve been taking them (double) with muscle relaxers just because i know it’s abusing it. 

but i realized this is irrational behavior so i’m waiting for my therapist to email me back with her next opening and i started my zoloft 50mg tonight...with pain pills. and i read that you can’t mix certain medications with zoloft cause it could harm you but i did anyway just because i know i’m not supposed to. 

i don’t know what’s happening. i can’t tell if this is the bpd or the bipolar and i’m angry, adrenalized, starving myself, crying, resentful etc.

i also have bipolar ii and chronic ptsd. 
i got off of my meds like a month after we moved into our new place 09/24/2019. and so far up until now i have felt amazing. little to no depression, handling stressful situations rationally, no fearing of abandonment, minimal arguments with my so and really helping my kids make better grades in school. 

but for the last few weeks i have been sleeping in from the time i put my kids on the bus until it is time to get them off of the bus. today i actually woke up and cleaned my home. may have been motivated to do so because my boyfriends mom came over to spend the afternoon with us, so i’m not sure if i should be proud of myself or not for being somewhat productive after all these weeks.

I'm NPD and BPD in a Co-Dependent Marriage,"background: i have a history of mood disorders and disassocation. i was medicated with mood stabilizers for 15 years beginning at nine years old. i was severely bullied from a young age. i didn't have a lot of friends. my parents absolutely hated each other but stayed together ""for the kids"". never had a relationship with my dad. my mom would not accept my bisexual identity. they hated gay people and most minorities. told me i'd be kicked out if i ever had sex or got pregnant. they spoiled me, but you could call their upbringing unconditional love. 

i've been suffering from panic attacks, disassociation, insomnia, intrusive thoughts, and severe mood/personality swings for the last six months ever since i started to realize things about myself and my husband. it started after a huge fight with him. he said some triggering things to me, things that toed the line of manipulation or psychological abuse. ""your body is my body."" ""go lay on the bed and get ready for sex or i'm watching porn"". but i said some selfish things and nasty things about him, things considered devaluing.

our relationship probably didn't start out very healthy. i had a history of sexually pleasing men in high school and college. he was one of them. i didn't really want to have sex but i wanted him to want me. he was so opinionated and funny and outspoken. he cheated on his gf with me. then we went a while without talking because he started telling people were sleeping together and his girlfriend made him block me on facebook. i was pissed, but looking back i had no right. 

so then i dated a terrible guy in the army who manipulated me and abused me, promised me we'd get married, got matching tattoos which i paid for, dumped me over the phone while he was halfway across the country, and later found out he cheated on me and gave me an std. i decided to run back to my now husband (that same night) who had broken up with his girlfriend (she ended up in a mental institution for wanting to kill herself). we built our relationship on sex. he promised me if i could make him finish from xx blowjobs, he would ""put a ring on it"". and i tried so hard to make that happen. after a few months, i found myself feeling more and more uncomfortable during sex. he had a lot of kinks, things like telling me he wanted to ""rape me"" or begging for threesomes. pushing my head down hard on his dick until i'm choking. he was addicted to porn, watching is for sometimes an hours or more at night, and then comparing me to girls in there. fraud charges on our credit cards from buying porn. i have found it very hard to enjoy sex. in fact, i kind of dread it.

i'm not broken though, and i'm definitely at fault, too. i've posted many anonymous naked pictures online. i formed an extremely addictive online sexual relationship with a woman (who turned out to be a catfish). i have such a strong desire to be wanted by strangers. basically, anyone who doesn't love me.

i started therapy after several huge fights with my husband and i started reading the 12 steps books after a lot of marijuana abuse on my end. i realized i was being selfish and not dealing with problems or communicating effectively. this is when i also realized i have a problem with attention-seeking, needing validation, and toxic relationships. my therapist said i sound a little codependent, bpd, and npd. our first year of marriage has been hard. probably harder than most people's. i just feel like it's either all black or all white. i either love him to death and act like his little ""baby"" and ""wifey"" or i just devalue him and act like he is a monster and an irresponsible idiot and talk trash about him to everyone. it's like i'm a different person around him.

he has adhd and has destroyed 3 cars in a year and i try to be understanding. however, i find myself thinking less and less of him and reconsidering a future with him. i've built so much contempt, i don't really know if this is the person i want to share my life with. i realize that's kind of selfish. is it wrong to think less of someone over money and cars? he claims he loves me so much, but i feel like, am i just giving of myself over and over again. one second ""it's fine baby, it's just money."" and the next second i'm throwing it in his face telling him he's a ""manchild"". we don't really have any goals together, and now that i'm saying it out loud it kind of scares me.

what's sad is that i think part of me does love him, or at least i thought i did. i'm so afraid to be without him. but i'm afraid i've just used him to fill my void of extreme loneliness. but ironically, he does the same to me! he doesn't want me to go on work trips, he doesn't want me to make friends, he doesn't talk to his family (his father abandoned him and his stepdad was abusive) and we really only talk about other people and surface-level things...

to make matters worse, i sometimes wonder if i'm actually a lesbian, or if i'm just craving someone new. i've only had one real experience with a woman when i was 16. i remember really enjoying it but feeling so ashamed that i broke it off with her and told her ""it's not normal. i need to be normal."" i was scared to death of my mom. i've actually confessed to him three months ago that i thought i was a lesbian, and then when i saw him crying i realized how bad i hurt him, which hurt me, and i quickly took it back. he's my favorite person, and i could not even imagine a life without him in it. so i told him i guess i've just been sexually traumatized so many times, i must just be confused. part of me longs to explore the lesbian side of me, but i also wonder if maybe i'm just a covert narcissist and i've gotten tired of him and i'm ready for my next thing. i remember talking to girls in college when i was younger and them saying ""you're such an asshole. it's a turn on."" or, ""you have such a big ego"". so the dilemna is, i'm not sure gender even matters. i think i just don't know how to love.

the psychiatrist has me on lamictal, topamax and zoloft. i'm scheduled for an assessment at a mental health hospital on wednesday, even though my husband thinks i'm possibly overthinking everything. i keep having moments where i'm like, ""what are you doing? you're fine. you're not a narc. he's gaslighting you and maybe if left you'd be okay."" and then i immediately start crying and saying ""no, this is you blaming him and trying to hide from your problems because you've been exposed and it feels like you don't know how to cope and you might lose him and your entire life is ruined"". and then i have a panic attack and my entire day goes to shit and i can't eat or sleep or breath. i don't know how to function.

tldr; i think i'm going through narcissistic moritification. i thought i loved my husband, but now i'm not sure. he's been a little manipulative and abusive, but i'm also at fault. also struggling with my sexuality, but can't tell if i'm truly confused or just longing for my next victim.",1634309981,False,BPD,2021-10-15 14:59:41,"I'm NPD and BPD in a Co-Dependent Marriage background: i have a history of mood disorders and disassocation. i was medicated with mood stabilizers for 15 years beginning at nine years old. i was severely bullied from a young age. i didn't have a lot of friends. my parents absolutely hated each other but stayed together ""for the kids"". never had a relationship with my dad. my mom would not accept my bisexual identity. they hated gay people and most minorities. told me i'd be kicked out if i ever had sex or got pregnant. they spoiled me, but you could call their upbringing unconditional love.

"I had an appt with a psychiatrist for the first time ever, diagnosed with BPD and am just confused. Just looking for support","i (24f) finally saw a psych after being on zoloft 25mg prescribed by my pcp may of 2020 for depression/anxiety. the zoloft worked so well. yes i had side effects and some weight gain, but i feel like it really helped me with staying calm and just dealing with life better. i felt so fine that in january i stopped taking it. felt like shit for some weeks and decided i should probably go back on. i started on 25mg again. 

well i asked one too many questions to my pcp and she told me i need to speak with a psych and she can’t really do anything else for me. i went to an appt with a psych and i told him i’m just looking for someone to discuss my mental health with and someone to help me manage my meds,etc. 

once the psych found out my grandmother has bpd he pulled out a questionnaire. i said most of the statements didn’t fully describe me, i don’t have “highs”, just low days and days i feel fine. he said bpd can be just feeling sad and then fine some days. everything i questioned, he tweaked it to make it fit my symptoms. 

he tells me i most likely have bpd which explains my depression. this confuses me because i feel like his main reasoning is a family history. he wants me to stop zoloft and start on a mood stabilizer. he then asks me if i ever have anxiety - which is one of the first things i said to him? 

i know no one can diagnose me, but i am more just looking for people who have dealt with the same issue? i have no friends i can discuss this with sadly. i just don’t think i trust him. should i get 2nd opinion?

6 month after my diagnosis,"on the morning i was born, my father left the hospital feeling drunk with happiness. over 30 years later he says he still remembers the birds singing, can still feel the sting of the early morning sun on his skin and the absolute certitude that he was the happiest man on earth. he wanted to stop strangers in the street and tell them about me, who had already changed his life forever just by coming into the world. i have always loved this story, loved the way he tells it and knowing i once gave someone the best day of their life. i now wonder if it was already written then, that there would be something a little off about me. or if some things happened that made my brain work differently. i have some clues. i stare at the man in the picture and he’s not at all like my 11 years old self remembers, and his name eludes me and i ask him, what did you do to me? i wonder if he’s the missing part of my story, then i wonder if it really matters right now.


today’s doctor looks like most the professionals i have seen in the past months: well under 25 years old. like every other time, like every doctor before him, he politely excuses himself after listening to my story and goes next door to ‘discuss it with his supervisor’. i have heard it so many times lately that i can’t help but wonder if there’s actually someone next door. i’m tempted to follow him just to check if there’s a wizard behind the curtain. junior is gone for quite a while. i entertain myself imagining an old professor sitting in a dark office all day, waiting for junior to come explain the case of yet another borderline-in-crisis, then tiredly shaking his head no, unspoken response to a vague request: help me. junior comes back looking sorry and i forget to ask him about the wizard behind the curtain. his hands are tied, junior says. there’s no room in therapy and he can’t take the responsibility to put me on medication, my gp should do that. my gp wants you to do it, i remind junior. he shrugs apologetically, palms up, eyes down. i go home and i stare at the glass full of pills that has been sitting on my desk for weeks, like an invitation to end the pain. sometimes i hide the glass in the kitchen cabinet. sometimes i move it to my nightstand. i don’t take the pills and i know i never will. not long ago i had projects, hopes and so many reasons to be happy despite the struggles and the walls i had carefully built around myself. i have to believe that i have it in me to find myself again.


for now, extreme emotional responses and anxiety attacks are threatening to strike at any moment. old and new addictive behaviours sit heavily on my shoulders, tempting me every second of the day. everything in my current behaviour screams borderline and i’m not quite used to it yet. i repeat the word over and over. i write it, i spit it, i sing it, i deny it, i live it, i can’t get past it. depression has slowly taken over and i watch myself destroy every good thing there is about me and about my life. i push people away to avoid the pain i would go through if they abandoned me when my issues become too much too handle. the relief i felt when i was diagnosed six months ago is long gone. i was shocked then, and angry and filled with regrets, just out of a relationship i had hoped would last and that i had ruined with a constant push-and-pull i couldn’t help doing despite knowing the pattern all too well. brokenhearted and unable to manage the intensity of my emotions, not quite understanding what borderline meant yet but suddenly hopeful and ready to fight. relieved my behaviour had a name and a solution: schema therapy. hopes for better relationships in the future and more balance in my life in general.


but it’s like junior said: the system is broken. here in the netherlands, the waiting lists are so long that mental health patients have to wait several months before they can start therapy. gps refuse to give antidepressants in the meantime, because they’re not therapists. therapists refuse to give antidepressants because they can’t offer long-term follow-up. so i tried on my own. i don’t mean the antidepressants — although, like a friend pointed out, if you can hire a hitman on the darknet you should be able to buy zoloft. ha. no, i mean the therapy part. i have always had an almost obsessive need to understand things so i did what i do best: i read all the books about borderline personality disorder and completed all the therapy exercises i could get my hands on — those which help you identify emotional triggers and how to better handle your reaction to them.


it helps, of course, even though it doesn’t replace therapy. i can see myself progressing slowly but if something triggers an intense emotion that i fail to manage properly, i’m back to square one with some more damage to my self-image. i oscillate between despair and hope, never really knowing if i’m holding on or giving up. i try to hang on to the good things about me so i won’t forget about them in my darkest moments. i list the words and i read them out loud. funny. strong. generous. charismatic. smart. sensitive. determined. in the middle of my mantra the other side shows up and tries to take over. intense. insecure. manipulative. needy. unstable. complicated. and then i don’t know anymore and i lose touch with who i am. i know i should be able to be all of this, i know it’s not all black and white but i’m lost all the same.

Just recently found out I most likely have BPD,"i’ve been self medicating with mary jane and my psychiatrist prescribed me zoloft and wellbutrin. 
i haven’t talked to my psychiatrist yet as i do not like her.  and the last time i told her i smoked the above and she got really close minded. 
sneaky cunt only wrote me one months prescription for my zoloft so i’d have to come back (i guess she forgot there is more than psychiatrist in this city) 

anyway. the main point of this post is, i’ve never had any real friends.  i’ve always made selfish decisions up until midway through high school ( i’m finishing up my 3rd year of colldge) then. i started to try to be the best friend ever.  
to no avail.  

idk.  

i’ve never had a support group.  i go to university where people id get along with are on the fringes of society and i struggle between stayin true to myself and having to be someone else to have friends but when i do that it exhausts me relatively quickly then i’m crying on my floor.  
ever since i started taking zoloft and smoking.  i feel like i’ve gotten slightly better.  
idk. 


i find myself telling random guys on bumble or tinder about how fucking depressed i am. and how alone i feel.  no one wants to hear it nor cares. 

idk. 
i don’t have any friends.  
most days the only people i talk to is no one actually.  maybe my mom if she answers her phone. 
i have my dog, a sweet puppy i got on valentine’s day this year. i think my puppy is a sign/miracle from god because valentine’s day always depressed the hell out of me.  

idk. 
in high school i used to cry and cry cry for hours  sit on my floor and wail and scream  punch myself in my head. 

idk. 
one thing that alway fucked with me waswhen people didn’t want to be friend anymore they’d try to pretend it wasn’t me. or they’d say it was me and give a bullshit excuse. 

i don’t know what to do. 

i’m literally alone.  
i have my puppy and i love her but she deserves someone better than me.   i find myself getting frustrated with her when she doesn’t pee or poop right or goes out of her way to destroy something of mine.  
it took a while to realise that she’s a dog for crying out loud she doesn’t understand.  
i’m not going to give her away.  
for some reason, god sent her to me. 
i remember my first dog was injured by me when i hit her too hard ( please don’t tell me how awful i am for this. i already know.  i already know) 
i desperately searched facebook and craigslist day and night looking for a new doggy friend and after two weeks of that on valentine’s day at 4 pm i said i’m going to check one more time then i’m getting ready for class.  the first post that popped up when i refreshed there she was. i dropped everything and drove to get her.  
i almost killed cauliflower(what i’m going to call her for this post) on easter sunday april 1st when i think she pooped on my moms carpet (my mom didn’t want me to get a dog in the first place because i couldn’t afford one. i really can’t. but i’d like to think i’d be back to idealising suicide without her) and i don’t know what happened. i guess i had a psychotic episode. and cauli started to breathe terribly just as my other dog did and i rushed her to an emergency vet who s said i should euthanise her. (my father went into the hospital on april 1st the previous year and died the next night. my psychiatrist who is stupid asf  unaware of my other symptoms outside of depression and anxiety ) suggested i get an esa. 
long story short. cauli was fine the next day unlike my dad which makes me think that cauli is going to help me get through this somehow. 

i don’t really hit her anymore. when she does something that triggers me i tend to get upset and storm over to her and then i look into her eyes and realise what monster i just turned into. 
since i started smoking regularly i’ve been gradually becoming more aware of my triggers. 
and since i almost lost cauli i realised how utterly destructive i can be and since then i’ve become much much much better at controlling little triggers and since then i have yet to hit her.  


however, i’m glad i’m learning how to control my outbursts with my dog rather than my future infant child who won’t stop crying 

i know some of you may think that i am a horrible person and i’m sorry.  
i really don’t want to be. 

i guess i just want to know. 
what do you do for support in real life to help cope when you absolutely have no one who understands/willing to listen and not even a single soul as a friend? 

i’m extremely frustrated with life.  i keep trying to calm myself and say it’s okay. it’s for the best for x y and z but that just makes me believe i’ll always be this way.  

i don’t know what to do. 
i don’t know who to talk to. 
my mom is 61 and still believes most stigmas around mental health so she’s useless in this respect.  
and my dog doesn’t speak english. 
now my mood randomly just shifted  because of the dog joke i just made. so i guess that’s good 

i just really need help. 

i made an appointment with a different psychiatrist for next week. but i need to know what i can do now from real people.  
not an online article that gives me vague techniques where i have to purchase 4 different books to learn.  

edit: i say in real life because online support groups help.  but i used to be so dependent on online forums and people for all my support and social interaction and it wasn’t good for me.  
i need to get out of head and off of the computer.",1524945731,False,BPD,2018-04-28 20:02:11,"Just recently found out I most likely have BPD i’ve been self medicating with mary jane and my psychiatrist prescribed me zoloft and wellbutrin. 
i haven’t talked to my psychiatrist yet as i do not like her.  and the last time i told her i smoked the above and she got really close minded. 
sneaky cunt only wrote me one months prescription for my zoloft so i’d have to come back (i guess she forgot there is more than psychiatrist in this city) 

anyway. the main point of this post is, i’ve never had any real friends.  i’ve always made selfish decisions up until midway through high school ( i’m finishing up my 3rd year of colldge) then. i started to try to be the best friend ever.  
to no avail.  

idk.  

i’ve never had a support group.  i go to university where people id get along with are on the fringes of society and i struggle between stayin true to myself and having to be someone else to have friends but when i do that it exhausts me relatively quickly then i’m crying on my floor.  
ever since i started taking zoloft and smoking.  i feel like i’ve gotten slightly better.  
idk. 


i find myself telling random guys on bumble or tinder about how fucking depressed i am. and how alone i feel.  no one wants to hear it nor cares. 

idk. 
i don’t have any friends.  
most days the only people i talk to is no one actually.  maybe my mom if she answers her phone. 
i have my dog, a sweet puppy i got on valentine’s day this year. i think my puppy is a sign/miracle from god because valentine’s day always depressed the hell out of me.  

idk. 
in high school i used to cry and cry cry for hours  sit on my floor and wail and scream  punch myself in my head. 

idk. 
one thing that alway fucked with me waswhen people didn’t want to be friend anymore they’d try to pretend it wasn’t me. or they’d say it was me and give a bullshit excuse. 

i don’t know what to do. 

i’m literally alone.  
i have my puppy and i love her but she deserves someone better than me.   i find myself getting frustrated with her when she doesn’t pee or poop right or goes out of her way to destroy something of mine.  
it took a while to realise that she’s a dog for crying out loud she doesn’t understand.  
i’m not going to give her away.

$600/45 min or free eternity in the abyss?,"hello everyone!

currently, i am feeling not so good. terrible really. and i don't like it!

**dilemma: see my doctor for $600/45 minutes with the chance a new prescription will work or spend forever in a dark hole (for free!)?**

my insurance does not cover personality disorders (amongst many other things). my last bill was $600 and i can not afford that again (that is about 3 months of groceries for me).

does anyone have any advice about what i should do?

i am diagnosed with bpd, bipolar, adhd, depression, and beta thalassemia (genetic blood disorder).

i was doing well for a stretch of about a year. then these past few weeks have gone downhill. i cry all the time, in class, at the gym, on the phone. i feel no energy to do anything. as a full-time student at university, i can feel homework piling on me as i have a full credit load of senior level math, physics, and computer science courses (as well as undergraduate research). i also work as a tutor and find it hard to concentrate on the students and help them.

the decline happened right around when school started. it did not help that my new doctor took me off of vyvanse (20 mg) and abilify (7.5 mg) at the same time. i currently take lamictal (250 mg), sertraline (100 mg), and vienva (1.5 mg, birth control). unfortunately, there are no breaks on the school bus so i can't drop out and i must keep going to finish the semester. (i graduate fall 2019!)

what i have going for me: a rockin' partner who is helping me through this! unfortunately, i am pulling him down with the weight of my tears. i would like to stop doing that as soon as possible.

Psychotic Depression,"!!!!!!!! cw: suici*e

hi! do any of happen to suffer from psychotic depression? i'd like to hear about the symptoms and thought patterns it might cause.

*for the rest of the post i'll just describe my situation. if you wish, you can just answer the question above, and not read the rest *   🍍

i'm 23f, diagnosed with bpd, severe (&amp;chronic) mdd with no psychotic symptoms, and an unspesified eating disorder. (would also most likely qualify for a diagnosis of complex ptsd but that disorder is not recognized officially in my country yet)
i have massive attachment issues and fear of both physical and emotional closeness and intimacy 👑

i'm currently on bupropion, zoloft (sertraline) and a low dose of quetiapine (for sleep mostly).

i currently don't have appropriate access to a psychiatrist since my country's public healthcare is seriously underfunded and i cant afford private ones. so it has been a minute since i've talked to a professional. that's mostly why i'm on reddit asking this stuff again lol. 

so. i'm very depressed.  so deeply depressed my legs and arms and head often feel so heavy i feel like i can't move. i'm so consumed by this endless feeling that everything is thoroughly meaningless. i can't shake the feeling, i constantly try to combat it with logic and reasoning but i can't, really. i always end up thinking i'm just deceiving myself to avoid the unpleasant reality.

i'm often puzzled by most other people: they clearly seem to find a lot of meaning in life, getting into relationships and having kids and advancing their careers and planning their future etc. going through a lot of hardship just to continue living. as i observe people i mostly feel fascinated and confused. i don't know what it is that they find valuable about existing. it's almost like there is a secret that most other people know and i don't, i'm for some reason left out of the club.
 it's like being invited to a place at a very spesific time and once you arrive you have no idea why you needed to be there, yet for everyone else it seems to be perfectly clear what they're supposed to do and why.

so at this point, maybe you're asking: are you suicidal? and, well, yes. of course. but not acutely. i'm chronically suicidal, so suicide is ""always on the menu"" .

i spend most of my time either angry or afraid. mostly afraid. i'm so insanely afraid of a ""catastrophe"". i don't know what it (the catastrophe) is. i just can't let go of the idea that the world is full of dangers i am not equipped to handle and it's just a matter of time that i will be crushed. because i'm fundamentally weaker than most people and i was just not built for this world. my survival was not intended to happen, it's unnatural and futile to try and change that. 

do these sound like psychotic thoughts to you? or just ptsd/bpd stuff? or maybe something else?

Medication worsening BPD symptoms,"hi,
i'm new here and i wanted to ask the community some questions with their experience of bpd and medication.
i'd like to give a trigger warning also, just incase.

so, i've been to counselling ever since i was around 13 and i've tried medication on and off from ages 14 to 21 including fluoxetine, amitriptyline, sertraline, mirtazapine. i've never felt like any medication suited me. i want to know if anyone else has been the same.

last year i stopped taking any medication and decided i don't think i ever want to try again. i've noticed that every time i go on medication, my symptoms worsen to a point where every day is my worst day. my life becomes so hard to manage and i turn into a different person. i've had the same experience on any antidepressants i've taken and it isn't just the worsening you get when first start them, it's throughout the whole time being on them.

i start talking really loud, even shouting but i don't realise i'm doing it, i talk and talk for hours on end and can't stop, i would be constantly irritable or raging, i developed insomnia and lost so much weight because i just couldn't eat, dissasociating daily, i was super paranoid and i felt like i was constantly at war with myself. self harm and suicide was on my mind everyday. i ended up engaging in self harm. i was very easily influenced and putting myself in dangerous situations more than usual. being horrible towards people or oversharing without realising. etc.
its like being in a meltdown or episode 24/7.

after my last time trying meds, i had moved house and started seeing a new therapist who told me that i shouldn't be treated with medication, that many times meds can make bpd symptoms worse and that i need cbt. this was the first time i had been told this and the first time i hadn't felt i was being penalised for not wanting to use medication anymore. i couldn't understand why the 10+ therapists ive had in the past never warned me that my symptoms could worsen with medication.

i came off my medication and after months went back to what i would call 'myself'. all the symptoms that had exacerbated calmed down, my speech went back to normal, i never think about self harm and i don't think about suicide half as much and meltdowns have been rare. i started to realise that growing up, anytime i took medication, this happened. it's like every symptom is cranked up to 10.
since then, i've spoken to people who say medication has been great for them and i haven't really found anyone who has the same experience as me.

everything i've read, and even had to study academically recently (i'm studying nursing and am doing a mental health subject this session, in which i've had to complete a presentation on bpd itself lol) scares the hell out of me because all signs point to that, as well as other disorders quite likely, on top of the generalised depression/anxiety disorders i've already been diagnosed with.

so my question is, if i hear those three scary words from this new psychologist i've found, does anyone have any advice or resources/links/books/videos they can recommend for newly diagnosed people?i've read a lot on it but the reality that this may be what has been going on for me this whole time in life is starting to sink in and idk, i'm really scared to hear it if it is so, i guess i want to know if it really is possible to recover/ get better/ get in control of the symptoms with the right help?? or is it really as insidious a disorder as some things i've read do make it out to be??

does anyone have any insights into antidepressants?,"so i’m currently ubpd or bipolar, i’m going through the motions at the moment, but i’m really starting to feel like shit.  like really shit.

Sertraline mistake,"i took one of my mum's sertraline antidepressants last night. i don't know why. i didn't want to feel anything anymore, but it went horribly wrong.


it says that you shouldn't take them if you experience mania, and i have mania like symptoms when i really get going. as well as the fact that they weren't designed for someone with a personality disorder to take.


my mind was wired. i felt weird, like i was bouncing from dissasociating and not rapidly. i got really upset but couldn't physically show it and it made the feeling of not being in control even worse. 


i also meticulously planned out my suicide while my mind raced at a thousand miles a second and i convinced myself i was a fucking terrible person who deserved to lose everybody.


i then puked.


this morning, i feel like i am on a come down and i'm dissasociating hard. i was a heavy drug user up until a few years ago and i know what a come down feels like and this is it. it's disgusting and grim and i regret it, but at the same time i don't. the simple antidepressant messed with my mind royally.

Advice?,"hi there. just looking for some general advice.

i've struggled with mood issues and depression for years, beginning as early as fifth grade where i first mentioned suicide to my parents.
 

in middle school i received a vague diagnosis of bipolar disorder type two, and i began treatment.


for the last year or so, i have become more and more unstable both in thoughts about myself and my relationships with others. my depression also became more severe, and i began self harming.


wondering if i might have been misdiagnosed after some research, i brought up the issue with my psychiatrist after feeling a deeper connection to bpd than bp type two.


well, he recommended a psychologist to me who does psychological testing. after quite a few tests, i got quite the whammy of a diagnosis. yes- i did have bipolar disorder. but- i also had bpd, gad, and dependent personality disorder and negativistic (also known as passive aggressive) personality disorder.



i'm still on the meds i was before my newest diagnosis- lamictal, zoloft, and xanax. i also just started taking a very low dose of amitriptyline but that is more for my very severe ibs. 


i also really liked the psychologist who did my testing, and he has offered to do therapy for me which is a relief. he is a psychotherapist and said he will be incorporating parts of dbt and cbt into my therapy.


i don't have any very specific questions, but i was wondering if any of you have advice for a teenager on the verge of graduating high school coping with the intensity of bpd, in addition to several other mental health diagnoses. i think i'm on the right track, but i want to know if there is anything else i should be doing. 

let me know if i have left anything important out.

intro/vent/newly diagnosed!,"hello!  
so, i got diagnosed two weeks ago after years and years of all sorts of practitioners being confused about why no meds seem to be helping and me being frustrated with different kinds of therapy and feeling like people don't 'get it' (i'm sure sadly is a common experience?)  
i got prescribed some zoloft and a great antipsychotic that's been really helping me to manage my moods and emotions and anxiety, and i'm really excited to feel that it's working, but also terrified that i know my symptoms aren't gone and they won't be until i get confident in dbt things. but!! ok here's the thing:

i currently am staying abroad, as i have some friends here and there is very easy access to decent psych care. my financial situation is a complete and utter disaster, but i know for a fact that my quality of life is much better when i am there and i generally feel more 'myself'(although, at the moment i am not sure what that means).

the initial plan was to move back to the us, get a job of any kind that i can pay rent with and slowly but surely make it to a decent level of life where i am hopefully able to get a therapist and deal with my brain. 

however! here's the rant part:  
i am struggling so much at the moment with trusting myself at all, and it makes making decisions feel absolutely impossible; i have two university degrees and yet am not at all able to get a job in any field; i am apparently quite intelligent and fluent in a few academic fields and yet cannot bring myself to do absolutely anything with it because it feels like any knowledge i have ever acquired wasn't acquired by me but that i was pretending to be different things (!) and i do not know what it feels like when i am not pretending and i am extremely tired of this; and i have considered not really thinking about any of it and focusing on my mental health but in order to do that i need to find a job as i do not have any support from any relatives whatsoever; and in order to get a job i need to figure out what i like and/or what i can tolerate doing and at the moment i am completely blanking out. i have never kept a job for longer than a year (and that happened only like twice and it feels like that was by accident and/or because i got too obsessed with the narcissistic boss); 

on top of it all, i feel completely overwhelmed with what i would even do about my diagnosis; the mental health professional didn't give me much information and every friend i have reached out to seem to either not know how to react or be scared, which makes this feel even more scary; i don't even want to get into the fact that most information online is about how terrifying it is to be around a bpd person and so little resources for bpd ppl?!??!?!??!   
also from what i have researched myself i think i might be what they call a 'quiet' bpd type since i don't really act out but instead like trap it inside -- i know i developed this as a coping mechanism sometime as a teen which has thankfully saved my life a few times but now this makes it really confusing for me to even understand what is happening with me forget to try and communicate to my friends 'what this diagnosis means'. 

anyway !! i don't know what the point of this is besides the fact that i think i could really use a community and or some advice or support, i've been sitting inside for the past two weeks after i've gotten the diagnosis and coming out to get candy and food, i am feeling fine overall because of the antidepressant but also really need to decide what continent i am going to live on in two months and how i am going to afford food and what my life is going to look like from now on in general and that inevitably is stressful even though the drugs make it feel a bit more manageable than i know it normally would.

Old Behaviors Coming Back - How do I proceed?,"hi all,

i have never made a reddit post before on any sub and i'm so nervous i'm shaking for some reason. i hope this is the right place for this and i'm so sorry its so long...  i just need, some help. i guess i'm going to share some things that will make it seems like i just want to rag on my boyfriend. i don't. that's the last thing i want. i love him, with my entire heart. but i want to share how bad it got, so that maybe someone can help me understand how to move forward. 

my boyfriend of almost 3 years has been diagnosed with bpd and bi-polar disorder. although i think the majority of his issues stem from the borderline (based on tons and tons of reading and discussion with a psychologist).  although he may have some bi-polar traits, his symptoms, as they manifest, are bpd through and through.  i'm sure you guys know them well and he checks almost every box. 

we moved to a new city together 2 years ago and things got bad pretty quickly. by the time i reached my limit and ran from the apartment (literally ran with almost no possessions) i had experienced everything from daily possessive and manipulative behavior (i could write an entire second post about this) to keeping me up all night long when he knows i have to work the next day because he isn't done talking about something,  to destruction of many of my possessions, terrifying behavior while driving that threatened both of our lives, being backed into corners and screamed at until cowering on the floor, watching him bang his head on objects until he nearly fainted, a half sincere suicide attempt in front of me in which he took a dull knife to his arm and hacked at it while taking breaks in between to wave the knife in my face, blaming, threatening, then begging and promising everything will be fine...etc.. 

i didn't want to leave him and it took a lot of people in my life to basically force me to do it.  when i left i thought it was over for good. but i was worried that he would hurt himself because he was so low at the time. so i stayed available to him, i told myself it was to make sure he was ok, but i know at least part of it was that i wasn't ready to say goodbye.

it turns out that my leaving was the wake up call that he needed. he enrolled in dbt, got onto lithium and sertraline, engaged in private counseling once a week in addition to the dbt and began yoga and meditation.  i was extremely cautious at first, but over the course of the next year we became closer than ever.  he was the person i love. he is such a fantastic human being when he isn't plagued by all the pain, and i have been happier with him over the course of the last year than ever in our relationship.  it was a long hard battle but eventually i was even able to get my friends and family back on board - especially since they saw how much he had changed.  it's the kind of change that you can feel as soon as a person enters the room; its truly palpable.  

so.... fast forward... everything is great. i have never been happier.  my friends and family love him. we rarely fight, and when we do, we deescalate it pretty quickly, normal couple stuff. but then... a few weeks ago, maybe it was a month or two... i just notice that hes starting to be kind of overly sensitive again (this was a huge problem in the past - everything someone did was a direct insult) i noticed that he was clinging to little things, holding on to them and bringing them up later to fight about.  he has started doing this thing again where he tells me that other people have negative perspectives of me or my behavior (control tactic). he has started picking fights over nothing, etc... it crept up slow, so i almost didn't even notice it. my friend noticed it first in fact...but last night it was back in a big way, and i cant ignore it anymore.  yesterday he slept through a morning plan.  i called and texted many times on the way to pick him up for our plans, but couldn't reach him so i went alone - literally no hard feelings on my end, figured he was tired from a late commitment the night before.  when he finally woke up and called me he was irritated at me that i didn't get a fob key from his apartment office, let myself into the building and wake him up.... the apartment office is closed sunday, so this would have been impossible... long story short, i was able to talk him down and discuss it rationally and he admitted that he was being unfair and that he had been feeling kind of down lately.   later things  escalated again and i was up until 2am last night in a fight in which he repeatedly threatened our relationship because i was trying to engage in intimacy with him and he didn't feel i was trying hard enough....he didn't feel i was making him feel wanted enough....while i was trying to initiate intimacy.... it took 3 hours to calm him down and he was even hitting himself in the head again. when he did calm down he told me - ""you know i'm always going to be like this."" he also told me all his happiness over the past months has been a lie and he is perpetually sad - (i don't believe this, he will say literally anything he thinks will hurt me when he is in this mode- but i can't be sure of course)

in the morning he was back to normal and is taking it seriously- set an appointment with his psychologist to discuss the lithium dose etc.... invited me to attend, wants to make me dinner, laughing, etc..  he isn't brushing it off like he used to, and that's great. and, i feel like we have tools and knowledge we didn't have the first time around, and that's great.... but were about to move in together again and i cant shake the terror that this is about to start all over. i don't think i realized how traumatized i was the first time and the wretched fear and sadness in my gut bubbled back up last night in a way that has left me extremely shaken today. 

so after all that, i'm not even sure what my question is.... when we decided to give this a go again, i told him that i recognize his condition and, knowing whats ahead of us, i am there for him and want to proceed, but i also said that being there for him didn't mean i could continue to be the victim of his symptoms. i told him i could not go through another year of what he calls ""episodes"". the counselor present at the time didn't seem to think this was an unfair request. did i lie? does being there for him mean i'm supposed to be able to handle the way that he treats me as a result of it? is that the trade? if you say you want to be with me you have to be ok with me making you miserable for no reason sometimes? 

what does one do in this situation?  maybe i'm being too hasty because i'm so traumatized from the last time - maybe hes just having a rough few weeks and we can catch it and put some healthy things in place to address it. or does it mean that nothing will work and it will, as he said, ""always"" be this way.   is there a way to have bpd and not take it out on your partner?  

&amp;#x200b;

i am an opinion having, high energy and also sensitive (on a normal level) woman.  i am not the kind of person who is going to be unaffected by it when someone is repeatedly being aggressive or argumentative towards me. last night he said - 'i don't think you have the personality to be able to handle this, so it may just not work.""  is it time to accept that?  and what the actual fuck is the right personality to handle being treated that way? i'm lost.",1540229991,False,BPD,2018-10-22 17:39:51,"Old Behaviors Coming Back - How do I proceed? hi all,

it turns out that my leaving was the wake up call that he needed. he enrolled in dbt, got onto lithium and sertraline, engaged in private counseling once a week in addition to the dbt and began yoga and meditation.  i was extremely cautious at first, but over the course of the next year we became closer than ever.  he was the person i love. he is such a fantastic human being when he isn't plagued by all the pain, and i have been happier with him over the course of the last year than ever in our relationship.  it was a long hard battle but eventually i was even able to get my friends and family back on board - especially since they saw how much he had changed.  it's the kind of change that you can feel as soon as a person enters the room; its truly palpable.  

so.... fast forward... everything is great. i have never been happier.  my friends and family love him. we rarely fight, and when we do, we deescalate it pretty quickly, normal couple stuff. but then... a few weeks ago, maybe it was a month or two... i just notice that hes starting to be kind of overly sensitive again (this was a huge problem in the past - everything someone did was a direct insult) i noticed that he was clinging to little things, holding on to them and bringing them up later to fight about.  he has started doing this thing again where he tells me that other people have negative perspectives of me or my behavior (control tactic). he has started picking fights over nothing, etc... it crept up slow, so i almost didn't even notice it. my friend noticed it first in fact...but last night it was back in a big way, and i cant ignore it anymore.  yesterday he slept through a morning plan.  i called and texted many times on the way to pick him up for our plans, but couldn't reach him so i went alone - literally no hard feelings on my end, figured he was tired from a late commitment the night before.  when he finally woke up and called me he was irritated at me that i didn't get a fob key from his apartment office, let myself into the building and wake him up.... the apartment office is closed sunday, so this would have been impossible... long story short, i was able to talk him down and discuss it rationally and he admitted that he was being unfair and that he had been feeling kind of down lately.   later things  escalated again and i was up until 2am last night in a fight in which he repeatedly threatened our relationship because i was trying to engage in intimacy with him and he didn't feel i was trying hard enough....he didn't feel i was making him feel wanted enough....while i was trying to initiate intimacy.... it took 3 hours to calm him down and he was even hitting himself in the head again. when he did calm down he told me - ""you know i'm always going to be like this."" he also told me all his happiness over the past months has been a lie and he is perpetually sad - (i don't believe this, he will say literally anything he thinks will hurt me when he is in this mode- but i can't be sure of course)

in the morning he was back to normal and is taking it seriously- set an appointment with his psychologist to discuss the lithium dose etc.... invited me to attend, wants to make me dinner, laughing, etc..  he isn't brushing it off like he used to, and that's great. and, i feel like we have tools and knowledge we didn't have the first time around, and that's great.... but were about to move in together again and i cant shake the terror that this is about to start all over. i don't think i realized how traumatized i was the first time and the wretched fear and sadness in my gut bubbled back up last night in a way that has left me extremely shaken today. 

so after all that, i'm not even sure what my question is.... when we decided to give this a go again, i told him that i recognize his condition and, knowing whats ahead of us, i am there for him and want to proceed, but i also said that being there for him didn't mean i could continue to be the victim of his symptoms. i told him i could not go through another year of what he calls ""episodes"". the counselor present at the time didn't seem to think this was an unfair request. did i lie? does being there for him mean i'm supposed to be able to handle the way that he treats me as a result of it? is that the trade? if you say you want to be with me you have to be ok with me making you miserable for no reason sometimes? 

what does one do in this situation?  maybe i'm being too hasty because i'm so traumatized from the last time - maybe hes just having a rough few weeks and we can catch it and put some healthy things in place to address it. or does it mean that nothing will work and it will, as he said, ""always"" be this way.   is there a way to have bpd and not take it out on your partner?  

&amp;#x200b;

i am an opinion having, high energy and also sensitive (on a normal level) woman.  i am not the kind of person who is going to be unaffected by it when someone is repeatedly being aggressive or argumentative towards me. last night he said - 'i don't think you have the personality to be able to handle this, so it may just not work.""  is it time to accept that?  and what the actual fuck is the right personality to handle being treated that way? i'm lost.",old behavior coming back proceed hi never made reddit post sub im nervous im shaking reason hope right place im sorry long need help guess im going share thing make seems like want rag boyfriend dont thats last thing want love entire heart want share bad got maybe someone help understand move forward boyfriend almost 3 year diagnosed bpd bipolar disorder although think majority issue stem borderline based ton ton reading discussion psychologist although may bipolar trait symptom manifest bpd im sure guy know well check almost every box moved new city together 2 year ago thing got bad pretty quickly time reached limit ran apartment literally ran almost possession experienced everything daily possessive manipulative behavior could write entire second post keeping night long know work next day isnt done talking something destruction many possession terrifying behavior driving threatened life backed corner screamed cowering floor watching bang head object nearly fainted half sincere suicide attempt front took dull knife arm hacked taking break wave knife face blaming threatening begging promising everything fineetc didnt want leave took lot people life basically force left thought good worried would hurt low time stayed available told make sure ok know least part wasnt ready say goodbye turn leaving wake call needed enrolled dbt got onto lithium sertraline engaged private counseling week addition dbt began yoga meditation extremely cautious first course next year became closer ever person love fantastic human isnt plagued pain happier course last year ever relationship long hard battle eventually even able get friend family back board especially since saw much changed kind change feel soon person enters room truly palpable fast forward everything great never happier friend family love rarely fight deescalate pretty quickly normal couple stuff week ago maybe month two notice he starting kind overly sensitive huge problem past everything someone direct insult noticed clinging little thing holding bringing later fight started thing tell people negative perspective behavior control tactic started picking fight nothing etc crept slow almost didnt even notice friend noticed first factbut last night back big way cant ignore anymore yesterday slept morning plan called texted many time way pick plan couldnt reach went alone literally hard feeling end figured tired late commitment night finally woke called irritated didnt get fob key apartment office let building wake apartment office closed sunday would impossible long story short able talk discus rationally admitted unfair feeling kind lately later thing escalated 2am last night fight repeatedly threatened relationship trying engage intimacy didnt feel trying hard enoughhe didnt feel making feel wanted enoughwhile trying initiate intimacy took 3 hour calm even hitting head calm told know im always going like also told happiness past month lie perpetually sad dont believe say literally anything think hurt mode cant sure course morning back normal taking seriously set appointment psychologist discus lithium dose etc invited attend want make dinner laughing etc isnt brushing like used thats great feel like tool knowledge didnt first time around thats great move together cant shake terror start dont think realized traumatized first time wretched fear sadness gut bubbled back last night way left extremely shaken today im even sure question decided give go told recognize condition knowing whats ahead u want proceed also said didnt mean could continue victim symptom told could go another year call episode counselor present time didnt seem think unfair request lie mean im supposed able handle way treat result trade say want ok making miserable reason sometimes one situation maybe im hasty im traumatized last time maybe he rough week catch put healthy thing place address mean nothing work said always way way bpd take partner ampx200b opinion high energy also sensitive normal level woman kind person going unaffected someone repeatedly aggressive argumentative towards last night said dont think personality able handle may work time accept actual fuck right personality handle treated way im lost,0.8175088546726725,['Sertraline'],"```json

DAE know if Lithium helps..?,"i’ve been living with a “bpd” diagnoses for about 4 years now.

my medical file “resembles a well-worn passport..” so the—very cliche— story goes.

life also waits for no-one. i am trying to deal— but i can’t. i graduated from college, and tore-up my diploma. my best friend and my straight-“crush” got together in a beautifully-hopeless-romance (a narrative i find myself repeating, often). i am homeless/‘couch-surfing.’ i am thousands of miles away from home, “because i am gay and my parents won’t accept me.” i’ve been on waiting-list; after waiting-list; after waiting-list. dbt, cbt, just a regular-old psychiatrist; a fucking sage with experience in dealing with bpd.. nothing. —4 years untreated. i’ve been on zoloft for 2 years, and i am at the highest available dosage.

so the story goes bpd, can’t be treated with medication. i’d like to pursue a “harm-reduction” approach to my illness. i am not suicidal (i learned the hard way that-that is not an option; and you will be punished for trying/thinking about it). ideally i’d like to sleep through the rest of— ‘this.’

i was able to get a prescription for lithium— because, what the hell now-a-days.

can lithium relieve some of the severity and unbearability in feelings of anguish, and sorrow, associated with bpd/ptsd?

Just really frustrated.,"everything started last year after i broke up with a girl i was seeing.
a little background, im 22. still at my first year of college after dropping out like 3 other schools.

on summer i was on sertraline and my mood was a little maniac, couldnt concentrate, i was always on the move and didnt think about food. dropped around 10 lbs during summer.

my psyquiatrist then prescribed me velafaxine and everything sucked. literally sucked.
couldnt make it out of bed, slept 15 hours straight and couldnt do much of my life. stopped training and eating healthy and started binge eating everything i could.

im up the 10 lbs now, and even though im not fat, i feel awful about myself. stopped taking the velafaxine and now im on quetiapine and risperidone.

My Story and Advice on getting Healthy,"hello,

i've recently been diagnosed with bpd, and i'm motivated to work as hard as possible to combat this thing and lead a healthier life. 

my story:
i've always been afraid of rejection and whether people like me or not. this has caused my self-esteem to get really low, and has also prevented me from pursuing certain career choices because i thought i wasn't good enough or i didn't want to be rejected. the biggest area that my bpd affects are my relationships. all of my serious ones have never lasted more than 8 months and when i'm broken up with, i'm devastated for years. 

what motivated me to seek help:
this time last year i was in an amazing relationship with this wonderful guy. we just clicked really well and had all the same goals and outlooks on life. however, we were in a long-distance relationship because i was in grad school ~2 hours away and he lived with his mom, helping to take care of his disabled dad. eventually, he got an offer from an old college professor to get his masters in canada, free tuition. this turned our 2 hour ldr into an 8 hour distance. i was so frustrated at the time with the distance that i would pick fights that i knew would bug him, like money or religion. after 2 months of living in canada, he broke up with me and i was devastated. fast-forward 10 months to today, and the breakup still feels fresh and he is now dating his roommate who also got the same full ride to get her masters. i've been obsessively contacting him for months to the point where he wants to end all communication with me, which is understandable. i still think about him all the time and over-romanticize our relationship. last time this happened where i was devastated by a breakup, it took me 2.5 years to get over the guy completely. i don't want it to take that long again to get over an ex.

current plan of action:
i work out and i eat healthy, i've also reconnected with a lot of friends and i've been trying to fill up my social calendar. i just started seeing a np and a therapist. i'm on lamictal (after an adverse reaction to zoloft), trazodone for sleep, and the recommended dbt therapy (which hasn't started yet because i'm moving and need to find a new therapist). 

advice:
1. what other healthy activities should i look into?
2. how do i stop obsessing over my ex? i've told him about the bpd, and he was very understanding, but when my mind starts to wander i think about him and i cry and cry for hours....i don't get anything done and i want this to stop. 
3. are there any books or evidence based articles that are useful for reading?
4. i'm graduating with my masters in december, but i'm already having second thoughts about my career and i want to go back to school and pursue something a little different. is this related to my bpd? or should i pursue a new career after i graduate?
5. how do you stop day-dreaming and dissociating? this kind of practice has helped my get over stressful situations by giving myself false hope and separating myself from the current stressers. it really isn't a healthy process since reality is never as good as my day-dreams and i feel lower than before. 
4. is there hope? will i overcome this bpd, and lead a healthy relationship? should i give up on dating and just settle into a life of singlehood? i'm too afraid of experiencing another breakup and the adverse emotional reactions i have to them, that it doesn't seem worth it.

i've recently been diagnosed with bpd, and i'm motivated to work as hard as possible to combat this thing and lead a healthier life. 

my story:
i've always been afraid of rejection and whether people like me or not. this has caused my self-esteem to get really low, and has also prevented me from pursuing certain career choices because i thought i wasn't good enough or i didn't want to be rejected. the biggest area that my bpd affects are my relationships. all of my serious ones have never lasted more than 8 months and when i'm broken up with, i'm devastated for years.

New meds on friday. Worried,"i have issues with meds. i tend to take them for so long and then just stop abruptly, for one reason or another. it was usually due to them being anti depressants and making me feel hypomanic, and less stable than i was before i started them.

Trying to understand my BPD boyfriend,"we've been in a relationship for 3 years. in this time, he's made real progress. 
when i met him, he drank heavily everyday and self harmed almost everyday. it was so bad, he doesn't actually remember the first year of our relationship. he was taking strong anti psychotics, strong anti depressants and benzos. now, he's in dbt therapy, hasn't self harmed for almost a year, has stopped drinking and on different and far less meds (aripiprazole and zoloft). after watching the way he struggled, i'm very proud of him for making it this far. 

things are still far from what they should. he's still wracked with impulses. don't know how many times he's bought laptops, consoles, tvs and the like and has gotten rid of them in the same week. it's becoming quite a strain because it means we literally can't own anything because he'll just change his mind. 

he's also bulimic. therapist has put this down to another form of self harm but this is the only physical self harming behaviour he has now. cutting has stopped. 

in the 3 years, we've not achieved a normal sex life. since he stopped drinking, it happens maybe once every 6 months. he said he finds it hard to have sex with someone he's in a relationship with. he also said that he cannot reach orgasm, feels no pleasure from the experience and it's always been this way. he used to sleep around quite alot and said its easy to sleep with a stranger but with me...it's very hard. it's hard not to take this on a personal level. erections - no problem. putting my hand on his erection - piece of cake. having a little cuddle while i touch him - absolutely fine. trying to stimulate him or offering to try to have sex - nope. 
(he has suffered no sexual abuse in the past) 

he's currently in dbt after cbt failed. he complains all the time about it. he hates it. says he goes in and stares at the clock for an hour and leaves. he's still in pre-dbt, no group stuff yet. says he's not even ill so doesn't need it. self sabotaging again. (i said if he can get his mental health worker and therapist to agree with him, then he can stop doing it. needless to say, he's still going to the sessions.)

i think my favorite person might be my therapist,"(f14) hi so i just want to say that i am not diagnosed with bpd nor am i claiming to be diagnosed, i just want to share my experiences and get some advice. also sorry if this is a long story. 

i am diagnosed with ocd so here is a post i posted yesterday or r/ocd

“okay so about 3 months ago i started showing symptoms of ocd. it started with harm thoughts but it has been all over the place since then. i started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist at about the same time in february. i started on zoloft andean working with my therapist who i really liked. i was having a pretty positive outlook on life until about a month ago(around the end of february/start of march). the zoloft kicked in and i think not having the physical symptoms of anxiety made my mental anxiety worse. at the time i was having harm/homicidal intrusive thoughts. with the lack of anxiety and the thoughts i basically convinced myself that i was a psychopath and that the only thing i could do was to kill myself. on march 4th i was taken to the er after my dad found out that i had overdosed. from there (on the 8th) i was admitted to a mental hospital and stayed there for two weeks. i got discharged on saturday and every since then i have been really hostile and upset at everyone. i hate that i’m acting like this but everyone is just pissing me off so much. i’ve been really mean to my parents and then worst part is that i have been really mean to my therapist. i had an appointment with her today and i think she probably hates me. 

to be honest i guess i just liked the comfort of being sad and depressed and suicidal and now that i don’t feel that way anymore it makes me mad. i guess i just want to feel miserable because it is so comforting. i don’t know what to do anymore. i don’t think my therapist wants to talk to me and i think everyone is giving up on me because of my attitude. i just feel like everything is all screwed up and i’m not sure if it’s even worth trying to fix it anymore.”

so now onto the bpd part. i’m not sure if i have bpd or not so i can’t tell if i just like my therapist or if she is my favorite person. i know i have been acting really impulsively and have been trying to push her away but i don’t want to loose her. i know it is bad to have an unhealthy relationship with your therapist. ugh i just don’t know what to do anymore. someone please help. 

i don’t know if this is bpd or just me being a moody teenager :(

Experience with Zoloft?,"so i've been on zoloft for over a year now. i was at 100mg but it was giving my really bad heartburn so i cut down to 50mg without consulting my doctor. the transition made me a little emotional but things evened out and i've been on 50mg for a few months now.

"need for perspective and this is also kinda a rant, I could only do one flair lol","i hope this is allowed as i'm not asking for a diagnosis, just help with what to do. before you get into it, i just want advice on what you guys think i should do.  im a 17f and i believe i have symptoms of quiet borderline. i resonate with a lot of aspects of it but whenever i go about talking to my mom about it, she always invalidates what i say. of course i could be wrong but it hurts so much when i try to get a word in about it. i've recently started journaling when i experience a high or low so i can have ""proof"" of it. of course i feel i fall under the quiet subtype so it's less obvious to others, i just hate how she plays devils advocate against the symptoms i resonate with. for example, being mean to others in a quiet way (source: verywellmind). she brought up how i get very aggressive with my siblings but my thought was arounds others, not my family. i'm technically diagnosed with major depressive disorder but i feel it doesn't feel 100% right cause i'm not always feeling the symptoms, they come and go more often than those diagnosed with it typically do. i had a psych eval with a doctor and they said (paraphrasing, in reference to the depression symptoms i have) ""that's not enough."" it really hurt the way she said it, but i think she's right. i don't really know where i was going with this so i'll just move on.

i've been on an ssri and mood stabilizer for a little under a year and its definitely doing something. my mom says before the meds, i was always irrationally angry, upset, etc. but she never saw my ""high"" mood swings. once i started the meds, she said i'm more easygoing and better to be around. but, i still feel everything the same when i'm alone, maybe a bit easier to handle. (cw) i still self harm and have extreme suicidal ideations, all that good stuff. i just don't know if it's working all that well if i still wanna die i guess. i know what you're thinking, bring this up to your doctor. i do but they always amount it to teenage hormones and depression. i fucking hate that nothing i feel is being taken seriously. maybe it is just hormones but it doesn't make my will to live come the fuck back. ugh.

but, here's some of the journal entries if it helps with perspective or whatever. 

1. off meds 1 day. yo i just wanna die. i have literally everything going right for me but all i wanna do is die. i almost guarantee that in a few hours or tomorrow i'll be just fine, happy, excited, whatever. but i get into these shitty times where all i can think about is how i could kill myself. i'm so fucking tired. my dreams have been shit, i miss my ex so so fucking much even though he treated me like shit. i miss him in a comically painful way. words can't fucking describe it. i sometimes think i might have quiet bpd, i'm not diagnosed, but my doctor and therapist don't think so, so i just stopped going to therapy cause they haven't really helped me. ranting about my brain only does so much. i guess i just wanted to vent and maybe get advice.  
i post shit like this everytime i get into these headspaces, get good advice, and never do anything. i swear sometimes i don't even want to get better, i just wanna die. i'm diagnosed with major depressive disorder but it doesn't feel right. i'm on two meds, sertraline and buproprion, and they kinda help. my mom says she doesn't see my mood swings anymore but god i still feel them and i still deal with all the mental shit when i'm alone so what is it actually doing? making me more bearable to be around? what uses that if i can't even be around myself? but these shitty headspaces only sometimes come so it's so invalidating and i feel i'm just making it up. fuck i don't know what to even do.  
i already feel better and it's been 5 minutes
2. i take my meds everyday, i eat well, work, exercise enough, and whatever, and i still wanna fucking die. i can't deal with this. i feel so guilty cause i take it out on other people when i'm overwhelmed but also things are really good for me in terms of life so i don't even know. i just wanna die so bad. i feel like a wimp but i can't do it anymore. don't worry i'm not gonna attempt but i don't wanna feel like this over tiny things that happen. i'm doing everything therapists and doctors say to do and fucking nothing changes. i just don't wanna deal with this anymore. about 30 minutes later and i feel pretty much fine. this happens a lot, why do i do this shit
3. i could be wrong, but i do feel there is something off with me. i'm a 16f, so it could just be hormones as everyone says, but i feel the way my head works just isn't normal. there are some days, like today where everything is great. i feel like i'm dreaming but i'm pretty happy. of course the thought that nothing really matters and i wanna end everything is always there, but it doesn't cloud over the ""contentment."" but then there are days like yesterday where getting out of bed is fucking impossible. for example, if i was asked to do the dishes, i probably would've cut myself or at least cried. but today, i cleaned a shit ton for no reason. it's days like today that make me feel so invalidated in terms of my mental health because i feel a little too normal i guess? then the shitty days happen and it feels too real. along with normal and sad days, there are days when i'm really excited. a few days ago, i completely shaved all my hair off, a full on 2007 brittany spears moment, and i don't really regret it. those days i don't ever sit down until i'm absolutely exhausted. but the issue is though, is these different mental states (that's what i'll call them i guess), they aren't extreme enough to count as bpd or bipolar, or whatever else there is. that also when i start to doubt myself more because maybe it is just hormones, but i don't have any idea. part of me thinks i want to have mental illness just to explain and understand myself. i want to be diagnosed just to be diagnosed i guess. i also see shit. not ""shadow people"" or hear voices type of thing, but everything moves. the walls and ground breathe, patterns manipulate, other stuff such as that. i've never done psychedelics but i have smoked weed but i don't think that matters.
4. i am literally so happy right now. like, everything feels like it's going so well and i think i'm going to freak out just from happiness. like my entire body is twinging, i feel like the whole world is on my side, little shit makes me feel like people are angry at me, but i don't give a fuck. i'm literally yelling at my phone right now. god i'm so happy god god i'm literally driving right now. oh my entire body is tingling. i saw a video of a dog being abandoned and i was so so sad i wanted to kill myself, i think i'm okay now. i was at my grandpas pool and on my way home i went 100mph

also, some random shit i think is worth mentioning is i have misophonia and derealization/dissociation stuff that is diagnosed (or whatever). i know i already said this, but what do you guys think i should do? sorry this is so damn long",1627089871,False,BPD,2021-07-24 01:24:31,"need for perspective and this is also kinda a rant, I could only do one flair lol i hope this is allowed as i'm not asking for a diagnosis, just help with what to do. before you get into it, i just want advice on what you guys think i should do.  im a 17f and i believe i have symptoms of quiet borderline. i resonate with a lot of aspects of it but whenever i go about talking to my mom about it, she always invalidates what i say. of course i could be wrong but it hurts so much when i try to get a word in about it. i've recently started journaling when i experience a high or low so i can have ""proof"" of it. of course i feel i fall under the quiet subtype so it's less obvious to others, i just hate how she plays devils advocate against the symptoms i resonate with. for example, being mean to others in a quiet way (source: verywellmind). she brought up how i get very aggressive with my siblings but my thought was arounds others, not my family. i'm technically diagnosed with major depressive disorder but i feel it doesn't feel 100% right cause i'm not always feeling the symptoms, they come and go more often than those diagnosed with it typically do. i had a psych eval with a doctor and they said (paraphrasing, in reference to the depression symptoms i have) ""that's not enough."" it really hurt the way she said it, but i think she's right. i don't really know where i was going with this so i'll just move on.

My (27M) (ex-)girlfriend (25F) has been sectioned and is staying at an institution. I have no idea whats happening.,"hi,

i believe that she has made me her ex because i think she was splitting over the last couple of months. we had a relationship for about 4 years. i believe she has bpd or bipolar, but it hasn't been diagnosed yet. she has been diagnosed by her psychologist with ptss and adhd/asd, and she had been given sertraline (zoloft) for treatment. i believed this medication induced a manic episode in her, she splitted from me, started hearing voices of angels and could communicate with her deceased grandfather. she was able to telepathically communicate with others.

of course i had a hard time believing her, even if it was gently, and she would be increasingly mad at me. she kicked me out of the house. i knew her behavior was not normal, so after she kicked me out i got worried. i reached out to her psychologist and the institution she got referred to. it was hard to get information when you have to say you are her ex.

apparently she got apprehended some time last week. i hadn't spoken to her as she blocked me everywhere and her psychologist recommended me to distance myself. i believe the police has been involved as she is supposed to stand trial sometime in the next couple of weeks. i don't know what exactly transpired, but her friends have reached out to me. my ex had told her friends that i was stalking her. so any time i reached out to them with my concerns about my ex's health, they just wouldn't reply or basically tell me to fuck off.

right now i'm keeping her parents and close friends informed. i had lived with her through the period building up to the psychosis. it seems she doesn't want to see me. she only keeps asking her attendants for her new ""favorite person"" which she met three weeks ago. he will not answer her calls. i believe she scared him away good. i used to be her favorite person before the manic episode, but she pushed me away. so right now i don't know what she thinks of me. i don't know if she wants to speak to me. i don't know if she wants me to visit her. she is in a really bad state of mind. behind the scenes i'm helping her family and friends with all kinds of things, and helping to manage the mess that is her sudden sectioning.

i dunno what to do. i believe she is now given mood stabilizers or some other form of medication that helps with mania. but yesterday i heard she is still very confused and has extreme mood swings. she talked to some of her friends on the phone who let me know.

i'm scared to know how i'll be while pregnant. i get really pissy if i'm tired and i trigger myself a lot. i really want a baby, and so does my husband. and i'm just curious if anyone has been pregnant with bpd and how you held up. my husband is extremely supportive and understanding. he does everything he can for me, and pays attention to every detail. i'm just worried about myself....i can't find much on bpd and planned pregnancies...just...""accidentally getting pregnant"" because of bpd...

Dont wanna die but cant stand being alive??,"sometimes i just find it hard to wrap my head around this whole living thing. i'm a fairly religious person so thats the only reason im still holding on but quite honestly, i've been feeling beyond exhausted lately. i just get extreme mood swings where im super happy for a few minutes-hours then i instantly crash and feel so weird. i don't know how to describe this feeling but its sort of like a feeling of doom, like everything is black, like theres no way out and im trapped in 'here'. 

&amp;#x200b;

when i feel like this i tend to force myself to sleep because i know that being awake will make me go extremely manic at some point and i'll do things i regret (like cut or get super irritable). i just don't know how to cope with this anymore. i feel like i've tried every single thing but regardless im the most unstable person ever.

Service Dog,"i’ve been diagnosed with bpd, dysthymia, and anxiety disorder for fifteen years now. i’ve been in and out of therapy and counseling and i take wellbutrin, zoloft, and buspar as perscribed by a aprn at my university. 

nothing gives me much relief. i have a hard time opening up to counselors and i’m starting to become agoraphobic. i feel paralyzed. if i have to go out in public i’m so tense and anxious that my muscles start to ache and i clench my jaw so hard. 

i don’t want to be like this. 

fast forward to a month ago and my boyfriend got me a chow puppy who’s 3 months now and my life has drastically improved. i actually want to leave the house now and i don’t mind talking to people as much. as long as i’m holding his leash, i’m almost ok! i can see it only getting better.

i’ve already begun training him extensively (he can do deep pressure therapy already!) and he’s well behaved in public, likes people, potty trained. the only problem i see is that a lot of people squeal and come up to him. however, this even amazes me because any other time i’d have a nervous break down right there. i know he’s young and needs even more training (will train him through his entire life) but i’d like to know my options. i have no interest in bringing him into restaurants because the idea of making other people uncomfortable makes me want to die. and i have no intention on abusing this privilege. i’d just think bringing him to class and in public would make my life livable.

can i ask my aprn at the university for a letter for a service dog? if she says yes i’ll proceed to get him a professional service dog trainer. do i need approval from my aprn to make/have a service dog anyway? the idea of asking for help in this department paralyzes me because i can’t bare to hear “no.”  i think she might think my medication is enough, but one day i’d like to be medication free. and the medication doesn’t help with situational anxiety and depression. should i just start training my dog as a service dog in training before approaching my aprn? this fall is my last semester anyway and i don’t have insurance right now to see anyone else. is there a free service i can go to to get perscribed a service dog? 

i’d really benefit from teaching my dog to interrupt my panic attacks before they escalate and the deep pressure therapy is already beneficial. and these tasks would change my life in public. and performing tasks i can’t myself would make him a service dog and not an emotional support animal.

I’m not sure if my meds are doing anything,i’ve been on zoloft and wellbutrin for about a year. i was taking prozac before that but it was less than desirable. it took about 2 months for both z and w to kick in but they were working really well for 6 months. the last couple months however feel like how i was when i wasn’t taking anything. i feel like i’m living in one continuous spiral. i can’t keep up with my mood swings and it’s exhausting. i’ve always struggled with sleep disorders but lately it’s been unbearable. i make sure that i take my meds at 9:30 every day so they wouldn’t keep me awake but it might not be early enough? i know that meds don’t magically fix everything and i’ve been working really hard to remember/use all i’ve learned in therapy. i’m a quiet borderline so i’m not sure if anyone has noticed this shift...so maybe it’s not that big of a deal? my next appointment isn’t til the beginning of march so i’m stuck til then. i’m not sure what i’m looking for but it was nice to talk about it.,1608561492,False,BPD,2020-12-21 14:38:12,I’m not sure if my meds are doing anything i’ve been on zoloft and wellbutrin for about a year. i was taking prozac before that but it was less than desirable. it took about 2 months for both z and w to kick in but they were working really well for 6 months. the last couple months however feel like how i was when i wasn’t taking anything. i feel like i’m living in one continuous spiral. i can’t keep up with my mood swings and it’s exhausting. i’ve always struggled with sleep disorders but lately it’s been unbearable. i make sure that i take my meds at 9:30 every day so they wouldn’t keep me awake but it might not be early enough? i know that meds don’t magically fix everything and i’ve been working really hard to remember/use all i’ve learned in therapy. i’m a quiet borderline so i’m not sure if anyone has noticed this shift...so maybe it’s not that big of a deal? my next appointment isn’t til the beginning of march so i’m stuck til then. i’m not sure what i’m looking for but it was nice to talk about it.,i’m sure med anything i’ve zoloft wellbutrin year taking prozac le desirable took 2 month z w kick working really well 6 month last couple month however feel like wasn’t taking anything feel like i’m living one continuous spiral can’t keep mood swing it’s exhausting i’ve always struggled sleep disorder lately it’s unbearable make sure take med 930 every day wouldn’t keep awake might early enough know med don’t magically fix everything i’ve working really hard rememberuse i’ve learned therapy i’m quiet borderline i’m sure anyone noticed shiftso maybe it’s big deal next appointment isn’t til beginning march i’m stuck til i’m sure i’m looking nice talk,0.709016519241711,"['Bupropion', 'Fluoxetine', 'Sertraline']","```json

first post // kinda a rant,"it's been a month since i've been unwillingly weaning off my meds and maaan it's terrible but it's only 6 days more. i had to cut the dose down to half to preserve my meds until the psych appt so here we are. 

yesterday was the worst day ive ever had it seems, even worse than some traumatic bpd experiences ive had. i was like. in a full breakdown for three hours and thought id off myself, then my girlfriend finally texted me even though i hinted at her im feeling bad (earlier). not her fault. she was just tired herself. 

i lashed out at her and got angry because she ""ignored"" me for those couple hours, then i suddenly broke into sobbing and crying and i apologized to her and. i just feel so bad about this but at least she seems to understand. shes mentally ill herself too, not bpd but still.

nonetheless, today im feelign far better and lowkey manic if i may call it this way but also that sucks because i went out of my way to order a fuckton of things on aliexpress and buy a pizza and call off my classes (i teach kids english, individually)... rip?

im getting a bit tired, i hope ill be able to fall asleep

anyways. im hoping to get a prescription next wednesday. im on sertraline, lamotrigine and valproate and honestly? lamotrigine is the real shit. id be dead if not for it. fr

everything was going great, i am weaning off my klonopin that turned me into a zombie. i got buspar for anxiety and my zoloft dose upped. 

   
it worked perfectly because the group is on thursday and that's my day off.but. so i transferred hospitals 3-4 months ago, to a specialty center and the plan was to get trained on stuff before a new doctor starts in august. it works where there's 2 techs per doctor for the sake of continuity with clients and patients. i'm on board because then you work with a team and have a system etc.

"Not doing well today, could use someone to talk to.","i don't really even know where to start. i should probably first say that i have not been officially diagnosed with bpd. i am almost positive that i have it, but i have had trouble getting a psych eval appointment because of covid. many places have a 6 month waiting list. after browsing this sub i have realized that i have a lot of bpd traits. 

about 6 months ago i started taking zoloft. at first i loved it. i felt like i was on coke or adderall. i finally had motivation to get out of bed and get over my depression. about a month in i realized that while the zoloft helped immensely with my depression, i was becoming much more suicidal. this was really confusing to me because i thought that when my depression got better my suicidality would subside. i told my doctor and he upped my dose to 50, and then 100 mgs. the physical side effects got much worse (night sweats, diarrhea, nausea, muscle spasms) and the mental side effects have been practically unbearable. i've been having severe paranoia and nightmares, as well as intrusive thoughts and suicidality. 

i have never been a big drinker but recently to ease the pain i started drinking more. i've also done something that i am more ashamed of than anything. i have been taking opioids. this was something that i never wanted to do, because i know i have an addictive personality and i really love drugs a lot. i have been helping my cousin out since she had shoulder surgery, and i've been sneaking her dilaudids. just 2mgs per night, but i still feel awful and manipulative because of what i'm doing. 

honestly i just need someone to talk to, or someone who relates... i can't tell this stuff to my so bc i know they will be so disappointed in me and honestly, i don't really trust them. i think that's just my paranoia and mental illness talking, but often times i will hide knives because i am so afraid that they will come for me in the night with the knife. i should state that i have no valid reason at all to think this, its just my paranoia. i honestly don't know what's real and what i'm imagining. i often confuse dreams with reality and i am diving deep into my psychosis at this point.

zoloft made me loose my appetite to the point where i feel queasy even thinking about food. so after a while i went off the meeication so i can eat and sleep well (it also gave me sleeping problems). pretending to be okay in front of my family has forced me to eat 3 meals a day with them, eventhough they noticed i eat a lot less than i used to. but going off of zoloft after a few months of consistency caused me to relapse and go intoncontinous depressive episodes where ive started cutting myself at every chance i get or hitting something to feel pain. suicidal thoughts ahve been very rampant since then but i havent had the will to attempt.

the new semester started this week and im back to living alone. i havent eaten a single thing since saturday breakfast with my parents before they dropped me off and ive been rapidly losing energy since yesterday. i give myself the excuse that i forgot to eat because ive been having classes and studying (where i live our weekdays start on sunday)  and until now i havenno energy to leave my room to even make instant noodles and im too anxious to ask for a biscuit or something. 

im not a very fit person (21f), or large to say the least so i dont think ill last a week like this. but at the same time i dont care that much but thats probably just me and being suicidal as usual. i dont have supportive friends or community who will say im not skinny enough to have an eating disorder. they mean well, but they just arent very educated on mental health so i usually just keep things to myself.

Just Discovered I Have BDP After Years Of Anguish,"i discovered i have bpd today. i'm kind of devastated and relieved at the same time. i've spent years going to terrible therapists, doctors that are ready to just write me a prescription for the incorrect meds and being admitted to wards to figure out my problems; only to be put on medications that made me feel like an even emptier shell of myself, like seroquel+abilify. i've been put on zoloft and other anti-depressants, but seroquel was the worst thing i've ever experienced. it made me extremely uneasy/jittery and like i had just woken up out of a 7 year coma.

anyway, my mother had me when she was 18 years old, (i was at her graduation). her relationship with her parents wasn't the greatest, and she was kicked out of her house around the time i was either about to be born, or had just been born. i'm pretty sure i inherited her anxiety. my biological father was a guitarist for some up and coming glam metal band in the 80's (and was actually pretty good from what i heard), but was a deadbeat. things like promising to take me to disneyland and never showing up. she had a friend from highschool, whom my middle name is taken from, who was basically head over heels for her and would help her take care of me when i was an infant, but apparently was forever friendzoned. i don't know their particular history, but i do very vaguely remember a series of abusive relationships from when i was extremely young where her boyfriend would beat the living shit out of her in front of me. apparently i was 4 years old when this happened, but i remember a man hitting my mom in the face a couple of times and then throwing a desk on top of her, and her jumping out of the bathroom window to get away, and the man stomping one of my plastic football helmets with his foot as he slammed the door open to chase after her. this story was confirmed by my mother who was astonished that i remembered, because why the hell would my mom reminisce with me about such a thing. i can still vividly remember the layout of that apartment and what it looked like, but nothing else.

to escape this reality, she married a man in the coastguard. my mother and i moved away from my family and were stationed 2 states away. eventually she got pregnant with my middle brother. coastguard man was also an extremely abusive military type, who believed in whipping his kids with a belt. fine. but he would hit my 6 year old ass like i was a grown man and it wasn't just a couple..it was very angry, almost as if he was getting off on it, repeatedly. my ass used to be so beat i couldn't sit down for hours. it was some of the worst pain i have ever felt in my life. i would have contusions on my buttocks (never in places people could see of course!). i was a child, i thought everybody got punished this way, so i never said anything. and this was for things like ""pouring water out of the tub when he told me not to"" or ""eating a piece of bologna without asking""..one time i actually poured water out of the tub one to many times (i was fucking 6), and he grabbed me so hard out of the tub it dislocated my arm. i wasn't taken to the hospital. i think he used to hit my mom too, but i can't confirm it. i did used to listen to him screaming at her on a daily basis. this went on for about 4 or 5 years, and is still something i think about on a daily basis. it happened 22 years ago. he would also do things like put on movies like full metal jacket, the x files and other things that would terrify any average 6 year old, and didn't mind me watching.
they eventually got divorced and he kicked my mother out of the house, and she was once again rebuilding from scratch. single bedroom apartment with no furniture. my brother and i were forced to stay with him while she got back on her feet. he favored my brother because he was his actual son, i was basically his whipping post to take his anger out about my mother. he went through a series of different relationships with women who had children and they would all pick on my younger brother, and i would always get my ass beat for defending him. i eventually got kicked out at age 9, by the man that used to hit me on a daily basis, for ""being too wild"". i was actually just defending my baby brother from these strange people filtering in and out of my life. my mother at this point had remarried and i moved back with them.

abusive coastguard man at this point was being restationed across the country to the opposite coast, which meant my baby brother was being taken away from me. he would always come visit during his school vacations, and it was always one of the happiest moments in my broken little families lives when he would come back. it was also the most heart breaking fucking moments i've ever experienced watching my 6 or 7 year old brother being escorted onto a plane across the country by an attendant.
my mom and his dad fought for custody for what seemed like forever and after 4 years or so of this back and forth, my brother became too much to handle for his dad and he finally agreed to let him come live with us. eventually my mom got pregnant with my youngest brother with her second husband, who is actually my adopted father, and things were finally starting to normalize.
i learned to kind of mask my pain by trying to make other people laugh, because it made me happy to see people happy, and i would tell jokes and immitate voices from cartoons and other shit like the movie preview guy.

fast forward to the (somewhat) present. i'm still learning what bpd actually is, but i wasn't the weird kid in school. i was a 4 year varsity letter scholar athlete in baseball. i was voted ""most desirable"" (lol right?) and ""class clown"" and all that shit that doesn't matter. i did extremely well (and still do) with girls.. and i surround myself with great friends. the problem is, sometimes it all feels really forced and fake. like i'm an empty shell just watching life from 3rd person. like all these great people don't really care. i have a woman that is truely in love with me, would do anything in the world for me, and i feel like ""she's doing it just to be nice"" or like ""i don't deserve it"".

i still feel resentment towards my mother for ""allowing"" these things to happen. i've felt so betrayed, wondering how you could ever let that happen to your child. i've talked with her about it but it usually ends up in her getting defensive. i went down and met my biological father and his family for the first time when i was 21. he's almost 50 and still lives at home with his mom. recovering meth addict, and his family was extremely weird, manipulative and tried to get me to ""side"" against my mother because she ""took me away from them"". they bought me a one way ticket to visit them, and made it seem like it was ""so i could come back whenever i wanted"", but had no intention of flying me back, and i eventually had to make my way home myself.

i have horrible anger issues but it hasn't gotten really bad until the last couple of years. it's mainly just me losing my shit and accidentally breaking keys off of my laptop and things of that nature, i could never harm somebody. i've never even been in a fight, but i've gotten really sick of having to replace my nice things because i couldn't get myself together..i'm generally extremely laid back, but if something sets me off, i go from 0-100 in seconds flat. i feel like fucking dr. jekyll and mr. hyde..

i'm extremely irritable when i'm around people i know i can just ""let it go"" around. most of the time i'm not even ranting or pissed off at these people, in my head i feel like my racing thoughts are pouring out, but it comes off as me yelling at them. i tend to raise my voice a lot when i feel i need to make a point or if i feel like i'm not being heard. my girlfriend has literally told me ""it's like you're two different people"". i have this ideation that i've caused so much anguish and stress in peoples lives, that they'd just be better off without my shitstorm. i can't ever just ""let things go"". i have a pretty large group of friends who all seem to genuinely enjoy my company, but if i ever feel like somebody is even making the slightest attempt to hurt me in any way, i lash out and immediately go for the jugular. i haven't been doing this as much, that's one of the few things i've been able to get a grip on, but sometimes it feels like i can't control the word vomit/me flipping me shit.

i went to college for graphic design/photography, but dropped out because i have this constant fear that i'll never be good enough. i'll mill over something that's pissed me off for days before i cool off. i don't have any freak outs in public or around anyone outside of my gf and immediate family, but i can feel my screws just turning. nobody else really has any idea what's going on with me, they all just think i'm cynical as fuck, which must get exhausting for them, too. i've just grown tired of feeling extremely sad, lonely and empty on the inside and pretending to be this happy go lucky dude who's telling jokes to mask how i really feel. like nobody understands me and like i'm going to suffer for the rest of my life. i used to drink to blackout to numb the pain until that eventually put me in the er from asphyxiation/alcohol poisoning. now i smoke shitloads of pot. i hate feeling like i need a crutch, but for the most part it helps me mellow out/sleep/eat normally.

i completely distrust doctors, because most of them have either just written prescriptions or weren't getting paid enough. i've never had a therapist make me feel like what i'm going through matters. i've had doctors in the ward straight up lie to my dad. it all feels so debilitating. on the outside i appear like a normal person, but on the inside i feel like a fucking freakshow. like every time i wake up it feels like ""here we go again..."". sometimes i feel like with the things that i have experienced and have seen, i should have turned out to be jeffrey dahmer or something. it's an extremely painful way to live, i've just turned 27 now and i feel extremely exhausted. like i've lived 80 years. but my younger brothers keep me going. everything else just doesn't feel like it's real anymore.
at least i've finally found the answer i've been searching for, for the last 10 or so years. i absolutely loathe that i've ""inherited"" this anxiety and intense anger from other peoples mistakes, but i guess everybody has got to start somewhere.",1411476337,False,BPD,2014-09-23 12:45:37,"Just Discovered I Have BDP After Years Of Anguish i discovered i have bpd today. i'm kind of devastated and relieved at the same time. i've spent years going to terrible therapists, doctors that are ready to just write me a prescription for the incorrect meds and being admitted to wards to figure out my problems; only to be put on medications that made me feel like an even emptier shell of myself, like seroquel+abilify. i've been put on zoloft and other anti-depressants, but seroquel was the worst thing i've ever experienced. it made me extremely uneasy/jittery and like i had just woken up out of a 7 year coma.

Recently diagnosed and learning to live with BPD...,"morning guys,

i thought i'd drop a post in here with my story - it's likely not too different to anyone else's but i need to talk about it, with others that understand...

whilst i have people in my life i can talk to about the way i feel, i think it's hard for them to understand the constant roller-coaster of emotions, thoughts and feelings. shit, it's hard for me to understand let alone friends and family who have witnessed me change into a different person.

just over a month ago (june 17th) i was diagnosed as having bpd by the local mental health authority, this came after a number of events of personal tradagy and self sabotage including my mother passing away at the end of 2019, extreme and prolonged stress from my previous employment, suicidal thoughts on a number of occasions due to romantic (or not so) situations including marriage breakdown and failed relationships there after, reckless behaviour endangering myself and others abusing alcohol, putting my career and lively hood at risk... man, who am i?

for content, i'm 35, male, no children and uk based - i can confidently say that i am a completely different person to who i was in my late 20's. the aforementioned situations have caused this and of course, natural growth and understanding of myself, people, and the world around me. 

the culmination of my behaviour was on june 12th of this year when i had an accident in my car, no one was injured but i did crash into another vehicle and this was under the influence of alcohol leading to my arrest and being charged for drink driving, loosing my licence and almost loosing my career. my job is actually as an on the road salesperson for a mechanical engineering company, in the building services sector and my immediate thought when i woke up in a cell the following day was that i was going to lose my job, in turn the roof over my head and everything else and the automatic reaction for me was that i wanted to kill myself, if that happened.
luckily, for me my work have been extremely supportive and even though i am now banned from driving roe a period of time have reconfigured my role so that i can use trains and other public transportation to get to meetings and site visits. i'd really turned my life around at 30 years old and gone from comfortable jobs in procurement to switching to sales, pushing myself to do better, earn more and really challenge myself. in the blink of an eye i nearly threw all of that effort away. 

this culmination of events, the crash and the stressful situation surrounding it has really served as an eye opener for me, a blessed chance to start again, be independent again, learn to live a different kind of life, reevaluate whats really important to me and to learn to cope and deal with having bpd. i am currently taking quetiapine as prescribed however this is due to change in the next couple of weeks to an alternative medication. i've found the quetiapine has really helped as previously i was misdiagnosed (back in november 2020, when i had a breakdown at my previous employment and was very close to throwing myself infront of a train) as being chronically depressed and given sertraline. this went from 50mg up to 150mg by january of this year and i felt dead on my feet so stopped taking it. i didn't go back to the doctor and spent from end of january through to june unmedicated, instead trying to manually manage how i felt. fuck was that a bad idea...

a month on from receiving my diagnosis, attending therapy and airing all my issues, thoughts and getting things off my chest i feel great. i now commute everywhere by train and bike (bought myself a decent one and love to go out at the weekend, jump on the train to somewhere new and bike for rest trails around the uk), i've started back at the gym 5 days a week and can see and feel the difference that's making.

in the words of the classic fatboy slim album, ""you've come a long way baby"" and i really do feel i have. sure they'll be dark days ahead but i'll deal with those accordingly this time and be thankful for what i do have.

i'm aware that along the way i've worried, disappointed and pushed people away (i can hear the words i've said and see the things i've done) but i'm not going to beat myself up for that. it's done now and the only way when you hit rock bottom is up, and i'm going all the way up and using this time off the road, this chance to start again in the most positive way. 

i'm sure there is more i've missed here, but it's hot and i'm fed up of typing, ha.

I (25f) think my husband (34m) has BPD. I so desperately want to make us work but I am exhausted. Any insight appreciated.,"(throwaway for obvious reasons). this is long so i apologize. 

we have been married since november 2019 but together since early 2014. we have a 6 year old and 8 month old together. 

i have strong suspicions that he has some mental health issues. i know for a fact he has depression/ anxiety and i pleaded with him to go to the doctor so he could start taking something. well he ended up going and guess what he asked the doctor for? xanax. i am a nurse and i explained to him he needs more than something for acute anxiety episodes, he needs a long term anxiety medication such as zoloft, wellbutrin, etc. 

he has a history of being emotionally abusive, such as calling me names (bitch, slut, whore, cunt, fuck of) and this honestly burned a hole through my heart every time. he has also been physically abusive (only 2 times that i can recall). he has thrown a glass of water in my face and one new years he shoved me into a wall when he was drunk. the physical abuse hasn’t happened for a couple years but the emotional abuse is still there. 

whenever we get into an argument or i hurt his feelings, many times he shuts down and gives me the silent treatment. this drives me absolutely crazy when he does this, because i desperately try to talk to him to see why he is upset so we can talk through it as a mature couple and resolve it, but he doesn’t even acknowledge me. sometimes in the past he claims i am just being selfish trying to make myself feel better by trying to communicate with him. lately it’s gotten to the point where i don’t even try to talk to him and just wait till he gets over it (usually the next day) because i know he’ll just ignore me. 

his emotions are very erratic. one moment he can be happy and smiling, and the next minute something triggers him and he becomes a completely different person. i am constantly riddled with anxiety because i never know what emotion to expect from him. one night when i was 2 weeks postpartum, our son was crying and i asked if he could make him a bottle. he responded with “i was the last one who fed him. fuck you i want a divorce.” i was flabbergasted when he said this, as it was completely out of line. the next day i had to ask him to apologize to me as i was heartbroken by his statement. he apologized, but it didn’t seem sincere. on top of that, i had severe postpartum depression which didn’t help at all. 

lately, he hasn’t been putting forth any effort to spend time with me or his children. most of the time he is upstairs playing video games while i’m downstairs with them and i end up feeling like a single parent raising them by myself. i’ve repeatedly told him how i feel about this but he just responds with “you guys can come hang out up here while i play.”  that is not what i meant but ok. so i bring them upstairs and i’m still the only one playing with them while he is sitting on his butt playing games. 

i’ve basically had it and i made a terrible mistake recently. i posted some nude pictures (anonymously) because i was so desperate for attention and love. well it got a lot of attention and it made me feel loved and appreciated for once (i’d like to note that i didn’t talk to anybody that tried to talk to me). he ended up finding it and went absolutely crazy and i don’t blame him. i ended up deleting everything and profusely apologized to him. he ripped up some of my clothes and flipped over all the pictures of me in our house so he doesn’t have to look at them. he also moved my car to the driveway so it wouldn’t be parked in the garage. i went to work the next day and he texted “thanks for ruining our lives with your awful choices. you need to move out now.” i later found out he created a tinder account and put a picture of our daughter on there (um wtf). as of now i believe the account is deleted but who knows. i don’t go through his phone. 

so now we are going to marriage counseling after i recommended we go. his first response was “fuck no” but he eventually agreed to it. i went to my individual appt yesterday and the therapist’s facial expressions were very telling when i told her all of this. 

i know this whole situation is fucked up and i don’t even know if it worth salvaging at this point but we have two children and a house together and i just want to be a loving family and make good memories with them. he is just so hateful sometimes and i wonder what other issues he has besides anxiety/depression. my mother has bpd and he exhibits many of the symptoms she does. ironically his mother is a child therapist and recommended that i go to therapy, not her son who so obviously needs to see a psychiatrist.

the whirlwind that has been my life,"this is my first post on here so please be patient :)

i am a 42yo female.  when i turned about 16 i went to my doctor because i was having fits of rage with hardly no provocation and then a minute later i was crying my eyes out and hoping my boyfriend/friend/parent would forgive me.  my parents chalked it up to hormones and being a normal teenager.  i knew that it wasn't just that.

when i was about 22 i had come to my parents with my then husband (now ex) and a fight ensued so bad that my parents told me they didn't want me to come back again (i am an only child and things blew over quite quickly).  so i went to my doctor again thinking that i must have anxiety or whatever the case may be.  she then prescribed me zoloft and i thought that would be the end of it.

fast forward a couple years and my now ex-husband and me would fight all the time about the dumbest things..and i couldn't wrap my head around the fact that what was such a trivial thing was being blown out of proportion by me.  my husband then left me (long story but he got some other woman pregnant) and he said it was because, after 9 years, he didn't want to walk around on eggshells anymore.

so back to my parents i went.  3 months later i met someone online...picked up all of my stuff....and moved 4 hours away...i was with him for 4 years...but he was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder cluster trait b.  he would yell at me, spit on me, throw things at me.  he had tried to commit suicide multiple times.  it got to where we were fighting all the time and i couldn't sleep.  so  i went to rvh (in barrie, on) and was speaking to the same psychiatrist that my boyfriend was.  i told the psychiatrist that i couldnt sleep and that i was blowing up on people left right and center.  he started me on clonazepam, nozinan, trazadone and respirodol).  one day my boyfriend came out of his session with the psychiatrist (who was head of psychology there) and demanded to know why i had told the doctor this, that, and the other thing.  (i know totally unethical) and then the doctor told me that he hoped one day that he wouldnt see me because i had left my boyfriend (who backstory stabbed his dad over a piece of pizza because his dad took it and didnt pay for it) 

i am a nurturer by nature and i was always afraid that if i left him, there would be no one to save him if he tried to kill himself again.  we then moved in with his mother (who was an alcoholic) and we weren't even there 2 days when we got in a fight to end all fights.  his mom had me in the laundry room with a knife to my throat...i called my parents at 2am and my dad said he would pick me up in the morning.  cops were then called and my ex-boyfriend was sent to the drunk tank (because they asked his mom who they should take and she said him) and then i was made to stay up all night long and wait for my parents to pick me up (because she said if her son was in the drunk tank then i wasn't going to sleep).  and what was the fight about? i wanted to go to sleep because i had to work in the morning and his mom and him were up all night blaring music and partying (keep in mind neither of them worked) 

fast forward a year and i met someone else online, and he was nice, but yet again, he didn't work (was on disability which there is no problem with it) and his parents kicked him out of their house and so i begged my parents to let him move in with us (never should have happened) but he would go out and i would want to know where he was all the time.  i couldnt let him breathe...because i knew that he was a recovering alcoholic and my last relationship he was an alcoholic.  so i basically pushed him away as well. (short end to a really long story)

fast forward a couple of years and now i am with my current husband. i had known him since i was about 7 years old, we caught up at my cousins wedding, i went home with him that night (which unfortunately is not a new thing for me) and we started dating the next day.  we have been together now for just over 6 years (married for just over 3).  i explained to him that i thought i had bpd and that i was going to get help and talk to my doctor because i was so afraid that i would lose him too because yet again i was making people walk around on eggshells. i told my doctor that something had to be done.  

finally i started researching and i came across the symptoms of bpd.  i got the book i hate you, don't leave me and started reading.  i went to my doctor and said: ""is it possible that this is what i could have?"" and she said (get this) ""i thought you probably had this since you were a teenager but i like people to come to the conclusion themselves because you can't get help if you don't know what you have""  ummmm...so since i have been going to her for 26 years telling her about all these symptoms, you would think that she would have been hey, lets have you speak to someone.  and then she stated that she felt that bpd was ""a spoiled kid syndrome"" and  i was like, huh?  she said that children that were spoiled (i didnt have a bad childhood and was an only child but i definitely wasn't spoiled) are more likely to have bpd.  has anyone's doctor ever told them that???  

i am now on effexor for my anxiety and doxepin for sleep (although sleep is a rarity) and i am being enrolled in a program called, managing powerful emotions  [https://www.providencecare.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/personality-disorders-service-programming-sept-2016.pdf](https://www.providencecare.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/personality-disorders-service-programming-sept-2016.pdf)  in hopes that i can at least learn to live with what i have.  to get into the program i had to basically face 3 psychologists at once and answer 200+ questions to see if i did actually have bpd.  they confirmed that i did but that i was low on the spectrum and that they didn't want to change my medications but that the program would help.  so here's to crossing fingers!

\~as always....make today your best day possible!\~",1569244025,False,BPD,2019-09-23 13:07:05,"the whirlwind that has been my life this is my first post on here so please be patient :)

i am a 42yo female.  when i turned about 16 i went to my doctor because i was having fits of rage with hardly no provocation and then a minute later i was crying my eyes out and hoping my boyfriend/friend/parent would forgive me.  my parents chalked it up to hormones and being a normal teenager.  i knew that it wasn't just that.

when i was about 22 i had come to my parents with my then husband (now ex) and a fight ensued so bad that my parents told me they didn't want me to come back again (i am an only child and things blew over quite quickly).  so i went to my doctor again thinking that i must have anxiety or whatever the case may be.  she then prescribed me zoloft and i thought that would be the end of it.

fast forward a couple years and my now ex-husband and me would fight all the time about the dumbest things..and i couldn't wrap my head around the fact that what was such a trivial thing was being blown out of proportion by me.  my husband then left me (long story but he got some other woman pregnant) and he said it was because, after 9 years, he didn't want to walk around on eggshells anymore.

so back to my parents i went.  3 months later i met someone online...picked up all of my stuff....and moved 4 hours away...i was with him for 4 years...but he was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder cluster trait b.  he would yell at me, spit on me, throw things at me.  he had tried to commit suicide multiple times.  it got to where we were fighting all the time and i couldn't sleep.  so  i went to rvh (in barrie, on) and was speaking to the same psychiatrist that my boyfriend was.  i told the psychiatrist that i couldnt sleep and that i was blowing up on people left right and center.  he started me on clonazepam, nozinan, trazadone and respirodol).  one day my boyfriend came out of his session with the psychiatrist (who was head of psychology there) and demanded to know why i had told the doctor this, that, and the other thing.

I just don’t get this anymore,"like a bit of a life story here, but i grew up in a divorced household with a single mom and a brother who was a meth addict. mom has undiagnosed bpd, and brother is going on 20 years of sobriety soon. i was subject to watching them have violent screaming matches almost daily, they punched holes the size of dinner plates into the walls, threw dishes, and screamed vulgarities into the wee hours of the morning.

mom thought she was going through menopause but it turns out she was 5 months pregnant with me. i was her “happy accident” apparently. my nicknames ranged from bitch, cunt, slut, and prostitute. all before i even lost my virginity lol

dad dipped out when i was a year old, only showed up for christmas and my birthday, or to fight with my mom when he dropped off the child support check. he been remarried and divorced literally 7 times now, mom was #4. he had two kids before me that he would threaten and beat. 

step dad died when i was 10, then my grandmother at 11, and by high school i had attended multiple funerals and i was unable to feel anything while at them. bro moved out when i was about 13, and i became moms punching bag. i never knew what i was walking into everyday, but it was mostly her either not being home because gambling was more important than remembering to buy groceries so i could at least cook for myself. or i came home to her telling me how much of a failure i was and how i wouldn’t even be able to pass high school.

in high school, i had very few friends because i was a volatile and generally came off as aggressive. regardless i tried to at least struggle through classes, and make it through teachers telling me how much i was going to fail as well (due to the fact that i didn’t do homework, because if i didn’t understand i didn’t have an opportunity to ask my mom for help). i was in band and put most of my efforts into drawing and trying to stay stable.

when i was 16 i was drugged and raped by a kid who was in band with me, he gave me so many shrooms i passed out. he undressed me while i was unconscious and i woke up to him raping me. i didn’t press charges, and when i finally reported it the police disregarded my testimony stating that i was of legal age of consent. he went on to rape a 14 year old when he was 22, no charges were filed against him.

so i graduated high school, and moved out from age 17 to 21, and lived with a long term boyfriend in our own apartment. i’ve held and maintained work since age 17 as well. i was probably the most unstable girl he’ll ever date, and when he had to distance because of my emotional instability i just sabotaged the relationship from every angle. 

i went to see a psychiatrist and psychologist to help with my violent outbursts, and was diagnosed with dysthymia, marijuana dependency,ptsd, and bpd. my meds (zoloft, xanax, and briefly wellbutrin) led me to cutting, and suicidal plans that were hairlines away from death for me. i’ve hung myself, overdosed multiple times, and at one point had a shot gun locked and loaded and pointed at my head. not to mention 98% of my “friends” and “family” cut contact.

a few days ago i utilized my safety plan and went to a psych ward to be held on suicide watch. during that time i was talked down to by therapists, and doctors alike. one psychiatrist even kicked me out of his office for “dropping the f-bomb,” after trying to explain my situation to him and saying “i’m fucking trying to get better.” 

i’m off of all meds and drugs rn, and i honestly can’t understand how i’m supposed to get better or be anything but how i am after everything. at this point i don’t think i have a real self, because i’ve been focused on trauma my whole life. i’m losing what little hope for life i have left because my doctors have quit on me, and i’m basically trying to do this by myself. 

if i put all of my trauma aside and ask who i am, i don’t have a solid answer, and i feel like no one really does, but therapists seem to feel differently and act dissatisfied when i say that. i don’t understand wtf i’m supposed to be and i’m trying to just do what makes me happy, but it gets lonely when no one wants to be around you. i feel like therapy did nothing, and i regret not pulling the trigger when i had the chance. what’s the point? 

like i’m still angry, and lonely, and feel hopeless most of the time. i’m sure this is black and white thinking but i really don’t think this is working.  all i’ve wanted is to be happy, but that seems like such a figment also concept that i don’t think it’s possible for me. i’m trying to go back to my therapist but she’s not answering, so that my not even be a possibility. not to mention it cost me over $600 with insurance for staying in psych, so that just adds to the stress of feeling like shit. 

what does it mean to “get better” because at this point it all just seems like a bunch of garbage and an excuse to make a quick buck off of people who are really struggling in life. i would say send help but that hasn’t really worked so i’m just stuck.",1573437399,False,BPD,2019-11-11 01:56:39,"I just don’t get this anymore like a bit of a life story here, but i grew up in a divorced household with a single mom and a brother who was a meth addict. mom has undiagnosed bpd, and brother is going on 20 years of sobriety soon. i was subject to watching them have violent screaming matches almost daily, they punched holes the size of dinner plates into the walls, threw dishes, and screamed vulgarities into the wee hours of the morning.

Obsessing over relationships &amp; friendships/just started DBT/question about dissociation and meds.,"i will try to sum this up into three parts.

firstly, i have recently been obsessing over people again, particularly ex friends. i found out yesterday that one of my very few friends hasn't stopped talking to some ex friends of mine despite them treating me like shit. i introduced them all too so it's not like they were friends before me or anything. it hurts to think that he doesn't care and will still talk to them. he never even asked me why i stopped. i had an overwhelming urge to sh, but i managed to ignore it for a change (but drank more beer).


secondly, i just got back from my very first dbt group. it was incredible. i was really scared and i've had a terrible experience with group therapy in the past but this was so different. my last group was really formal, everyone was sad and the therapists were useless, we weren't taught skills, and we were watched by a two way mirror. only one person had been diagnosed bpd despite the group having 'borderline' in its name. today's group was relaxed,  the room is big, light and airy and instead of tiny windows and a two way mirror there are huge windows and the therapists actually respect you. i got a few handouts and took notes and i'm looking forward to going back next week.



thirdly and finally, after dbt next week i have an appointment with my care coordinator (a cpn). i want to ask about meds again *if* there's anything that could help me. i got nothing from sertraline or mirtazapine but my main issue at the moment is (aside from the crazy emotional roller coaster) is dissociation. i am in a near constant state of mild dissociation and i always feel zoned out or not with it. it's difficult to feel in touch with reality and my work and home life are suffering because of it. does anyone have any advice for this or can anyone recommend any medication (if there even is any) that might help? my ex psychiatrist did suggest amisulpride at one point, an atypical antipsychotic, but it was never prescribed. any personal stories or anything? thanks &lt;3",1456752141,False,BPD,2016-02-29 13:22:21,"Obsessing over relationships &amp; friendships/just started DBT/question about dissociation and meds. i will try to sum this up into three parts.

some days i don't even think about my ex. recognizing that makes me feel like half a person. seven years every day with the same human, relying on them whether you could or not, making every decision of every size depending on how it will affect them... then separating and not even speaking to them every day, let alone every week.

the on this day app is how i start my day. that can mean before i go to sleep sometime around three in the morning or first thing when i wake up at my alarm before going to work. not hyperbole: 95% of every single thing i've done online for the past eight years of my life involves dane. or our dogs, or our friends. almost every single day on every single year, he posted some nonsense on my wall, or we went somewhere, or i cooked him something.

i feel like the only thing that's going to help me get my head on straight about it is a massive purge. but my bills are piling up, and i've been sick for days and had to miss work all weekend. i'm just drowning in things i can't make myself do, again. i'm not sleeping again. yesterday during the worst of this sickness i actually napped for five hours because i had to take a xanax at urgent care. i was lightheaded when the doctor was testing my lungs and she said i was okay, but made me lay down for twenty minutes before she'd let me drive anywhere. i've been on zoloft for a month now.

today, i was going through my on this day and saw a picture of dane. i'm still attracted to him. i still wish he could have been what i needed him to be. all seven years were an act of desperation. i wish he'd loved me, i wish i'd been enough of a reason. but he was relieved to be free of our relationship, and of me. his resistance was because it meant now he had to sink or swim on his own. he's swimming really well.

and my new relationship is going well but all i do is worry about it. there's no lack of affection but it still doesn't feel like enough. it's all drew's fault. he's a permanent bruise on my brain. we are the same. there was always conversation, there was always someone who wanted my opinion on something or who wanted to tell me something. we are the same.

i'm worried i'll sabotage this relationship because nothing ever feels like enough. i'm worried nothing is ever good enough and that i might be some form of perfectionist. i'm not sure how to fix that. i have my own forms of disorder and because they are mine and i know my systems, they work. anyone else's form of disorder makes me want to slam my head against the wall. i want to cut. i'm overdue to cut but i'm in a relationship again and no part of my body is my own once again.

i've fucked 11 people since dane and i broke up near the end of october. not a single week has gone by since we ended that i haven't had sex. i was openly cutting while i was single. none of my partners could say anything about it, though they'd acknowledge it and be sad. comfort me, listen to me tell them with a smile that it helped and this is how i am. in a relationship, it's different. it hurts the person. it makes them think they're not doing enough or aren't good enough.

I am terrified,"hi everyone,

i suffer from borderline personality disorder and until now i dissociated from time to time but i never thought it was alarming.
i also take antidepressants, 100mg of zoloft a day. 

these past 3 or 4 months i have been getting really reckless with substances.
it has come to a point where i wake up at noon, i hit the bong, eat, feel shitty about being stoned all the time and want to be less passive, i drink a bottle of wine, take 1 or 2 lines of coke and wait for my friends to be off work and then we hit the bong again, drink half a dozen shots, i pretend to go to the bathroom and take a few more lines of coke and then nitrous oxide, one two three balloons and then we hit the bong.

i can't sleep, i eat junk food all day, i stay home with no motivation, no direction in life, no job, no hobby except getting so fucked up i don't recognize the world around me anymore.

i told my friends about how unreal and scary the world feels after nitrous oxide balloons, how i feel stuck in a moment forever and how i don't have a grasp on either space, or time, or anything else for that matter. nothing connects, nothing makes se ce, i feel trapped in a shitty simulation where i am the only one realising nothing is real. even writing this doesn't feel real... what's the internet, what's reddit, can i break my phone i have no use for it, can i kill myself, i'm scared ? i don't know how to explain but it's really scary and i did some research and read about derealization.

do you think what i am experiencing is derealization? do you think it will go away if i quit all drugs (except antidepressants?) do you think i should quit cold turkey and never look back or should i try to do drugs with modération ? i don't know what to do i am scared..

i’m currently taking lamotrigine 200mg and lexapro 40mg. i use to take sertraline 100mg but after a year i started to struggle with the nightmares, so discontinued use.

does anybody use people, knowing that you’ll soon abandon them once you’ve gotten what you want from them, before they get the chance to abandon you? just because you know the friendship won’t last long, so you might as well take advantage of it while ya can. it’s like these friendships have a deadline, a time set in my head.

instead of going into frantic efforts to prevent being abandoned, i abandon them first. because of this, i have unstable relationships and friendships, they don’t last very long because i simply just ghost them. it gets lonely. but, i’d rather be lonely and use this technique than live in constant fear of abandonment and mistrust.

i tend to have many small groups of friends, as opposed to having one big group, and i keep them seperate. this makes it easier to ghost people when i want to. i can ghost one group of friends, but keep another, just so i’m not completely lonely. this is also a handy technique! 

it does get tiring because i have a different persona for each friend group. i tend to ’mirror‘ those people, like a chameleon effect — i act the same, behave the same, talk the same, dress the same, etc.    i also have to keep up with the lies and different stories. so it does get tiring.

Newly diagnosed,"hi everyone! so i'm 29f recently diagnosed after 15 odd years of depression and anxiety. i was always told it was manic depression which i agreed with. i tried psychologists and counsellors and nothing worked. i self harmed and turned to drugs and alcohol in my teen years.  a few years ago i was put on fluoxetine (prozac) and overdosed but persisted with them for 3 years till i tried to overdose again. my gp then changed me to sertraline which gave me insomnia. i was then assessed my a psychiatric nurse and diagnosed with bpd which i had heard of but never looked into. i did some googling and connected with everything. i've now watched documentaries and some youtube and podcasts of people with bpd and i can't believe the diagnosis had not come up before now. i'm now on mirtazapine and awaiting psychiatry review (hopefully be seen after the new year). 

i'm reaching out really just to try and understand a bit more about the condition and what has helped other people with day to day struggles, relationships (i'm married) and parenting (i have a 10 year old). i've struggled with my emotions and other things for years but now i hope with this diagnosis that i can find a way to actually help myself and be a ""normal"" person for my son and husband.

I am functional,"i have worked hard to take care of myself and make myself functional. 

i currently take 4 different types of medication to try and alleviate some of my symptoms (pregabalin for mood, mirtazapine for sleep, propranolol for anxiety, and sertraline for depression). the doctors have been terrible about explaining how the drugs interact with each other, and how they might affect me. i'm now in the process of researching better medication options, but this should not be my job. i had appointments with social services to ask for help, but they were useless.

i have hounded doctors and psychologists for assistance. i'm registered at a psychological health service (this took me a very long time to get), and have gone to all the group therapy with fellow bpders. i have begged for dbt and cbt, and still haven't received any.

i make the effort to eat healthily, as i have binge eating disorder as a result of my moods. i went from 12 stone to 19 stone in a year and a half, this was caused by medication weight gain and binge eating. i'm working hard to lose weight but it's a slow game.

i avoid all alcohol and drugs now, whereas in the past i depended heavily on these to manage my moods. i have cut ties with friends who i loved but are a bad influence on me (drugs, drinking, police etc). i think carefully about my money now, and separate it into savings accounts that don't give me instant access so i can't impulse buy. i am in a long term romantic relationship with someone who treats me well. it's a struggle to stop myself from splitting on him, but i work hard and stay. i avoid self harming now, and if i feel that bad i dig my nails into my skin instead.

i have a satisfying job in a company i love. i have been transparent about my disorder, and they even made a policy just for me. some of the measures include: giving me any feedback in writing before a meeting so i can process it in my own time and deal with the moods, letting me have every wednesday off so i don't feel overwhelmed with work, and offering me a free counselling line when i need it. 

i think carefully about my responses to messages, sometimes waiting a day before i reply to make sure it's actually how i feel or what i want to say. i have put distance between myself and my friends at work, so i don't get overly attached to them and split.

i'm trying to learn more about how to deal with my negative emotions. i've asked friends and colleagues and researched online what to do when i feel a certain mood.

"Killing the BPD, Killing the only thing that made me alive... my story","hey /r/bpd,


i just wanted to connect with people who would understand.  i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder at age 15 or so.  my parents were divorcing and i kept trying to off myself.  i was a cutter into my mid to late twenties.  plenty of psych ward admissions.  two failed marriages and 3 estranged kids.  anyways, i am 30 now.


last year i had an updated psychological assessment done and the psychologist told me that i don't qualify for bpd anymore but that i have a form of ruminative ocd / depression.  labels aren't important, the reality of what i feel is.  


anyways, i've been on every med available over the years.  currently i am on seroquel xr and zoloft and clonazepam.


i used to be really impulsive and that ruined my marriages, cause i was always thinking the grass was greener and i admit i was a cheater.  i also tried to kill myself for years, though i think i didn't want to die.  i'm not stupid and if i wanted it permanent, i could have figured it out.  i stopped cutting, though i have the urge often, i used to cut a lot and i have the scars... which i'm kind of proud of... a badge that i went through hell.  i only stopped because my partner started freaking out on me for cutting.


so it's been years now that i've made improvements.  and by improvements, i should say i've met the goals of therapy and the er nurses don't know my name anymore.  


i just want to say that while i saw bpd as a curse and something i agreed to be treated for, in a way, killing the bpd in me, killed a big part of me and my sense of being alive.


now, i miss certain things.  mostly i miss feeling.  it's true that i felt to extremes.  i would love so fiery and intensely, and i would grieve with the same intensity.  life was a bit of chaos.  and yeah, it was getting out of control.  but the answer is not to not feel.  i am a robot now with the therapist in my head that can counter just about anything.  i have been in therapy more than half my life, and i studied it in school.  having the rational answers and the moderate outlook are helpful in not drawing attention to yourself, but honestly, i feel like a ghost, like i don't even exist.


i'm still left abandoned... by family, by friends, by the women i loved.  and so it's just me and this sense of emptiness.  you know ""chronic emptiness"".  that part of things never went away.  and solving some bpd symptoms didn't do anything to make relationships happen.  


in a way, though i viewed my past as hell while it was happening, i look back with romanticism.  i look back and i know that i felt, i know that there was something magical and energetic about life.


i just wanted to ""rant"" because i doubt i'll ever feel that way again.  i desire to feel, but the only ways i ever knew how have been taken from me.  


if you are trying to heal, i support you and can give advice as to certain things, but at the same time, i encourage you to accept yourself for who you are and not try and be something that you aren't.  sometimes, it could be said to be true that bpd is normal and everyone else is crazy -- and i think it's true, because a healed life is not a real life, it involves a lot of tricking of your own mind and intuition.  


i just encourage you toward love.  love is the key.  if you can feel, even if it goes from extremes, focus on the love.  that is when i felt alive.  and when chaos comes, you'll survive it.  you think you won't, but you do.  love yourself and love others, and don't be something or someone that you aren't.

“Traits of borderline” without actual BPD?,"asking because my therapist yesterday had me circle symptoms on a list of bpd symptoms that i’ve had and i circled almost every single one. 

she said “well, you definitely have the traits of bpd, even if you don’t have the actual disorder”, concluded that i could have bpd but she wants to start me with an antidepressant first for my depression and anxiety, and told me that i should buy a bpd workbook on amazon to get started helping learn skills. she also said they would figure out in the future if i needed mood stabilizers after seeing how i responded to the zoloft (there’s also the suspicion i could be bipolar?)

a bpd diagnosis is something the two of us are going to work on more in the future and i trust that we will. correct me if i’m wrong, but wouldn’t having the traits of bpd mean you actually have bpd? would it be possible to have the traits without the disorder? do you think she formally has to rule out other things before diagnosing bpd but maybe she personally believes i probably have it?

My doctor may diagnose me with BPD,"tl;dr fight with boyfriend nearly led to breakup, given a second chance with the condition that i seek mental health support. doctor may diagnose me with bpd.

some background: i’ve been suffering from severe anger issues, extreme mood swings, impulsivity (specifically with money) etc. for years and was diagnosed with a severe anxiety disorder in november 2019 and was put on sertraline which worked fine but i became reliant on it and stopped taking it in june 2020. i was put back on sertraline in january 2021, but i was suffering from not being able to sleep and being sick all the time so was put on propranolol in march 2021.

back in january my boyfriend (m20) and i (f20) had one of the worst fights in our relationship (for the life of me i can’t even remember what caused it), and he kept trying to make me leave his room to calm down to the point where he had to physically lift me out of the room and i said “if you kick me out of here we’re finished”. i don’t know why i said it, and i definitely didn’t mean it but i had a mental breakdown for ages until he was ready to talk about the fight. he admitted that he was strongly considering breaking up with me and something clicked in me and i started sobbing and begging him not to leave me, saying i’ll do better etc. and he agreed to give me one last chance (as my anger has caused so many near relationship ruining fights in the past). the condition for this was if i went to a doctor to get real help, which i promised i would so many times in the past and never did. so i called and made an appointment right there and then.

i’ve been seeing this mental health doctor since then, and through deep discussion we came to the conclusion that my anger issues are rooted from the 7 years of bullying that has traumatised me among other things. but he also said that he was certain i had a personality disorder, and gave me instructions to read up on all the personality disorders on mind.org with my boyfriend to see if we can guess which one it is (the doctor knows what one he wants to diagnose me with, so i’m not sure why he wants to play a guessing game for it).

after looking through these with my boyfriend we both concluded that bpd is the only one out of all of them that i actually fit the description for. in a way it was comforting to know that there is a reason why i am the way i am, however i’m scared that this diagnosis is going to ruin my life in some way (e.g. effect future career in law or journalism). i’m not really sure what i’m asking for, i guess some support or insight would be great :)",1619100497,False,BPD,2021-04-22 14:08:17,"My doctor may diagnose me with BPD tl;dr fight with boyfriend nearly led to breakup, given a second chance with the condition that i seek mental health support. doctor may diagnose me with bpd.

"I shared upcoming happy news with my sister, and she made me hate myself.","backstory: hi there. new to this sub, and just diagnosed with bpd and adhd a little over three years ago. was incorrectly diagnosed with bipolar type 2 at 15 and was over medicated for 10 years until i sought a new diagnosis at 25. 

as you all probably know, irrational bouts of anger, anxiety, and extremely low self worth are just a few of the diagnostic criteria for bpd. these are the areas i still struggle with the most, but my fiancé / boyfriend of three years is the most amazing support system and his belief in me is mind blowing. i feel like finding him was the universe's way of paying me back for my mental illness and mood disorder. 

i spent years in and out of psych wards as a teen, had a suicide attempt at 17, but have refused to give in. i completed a dbt therapy course and will most likely seek basic therapy in the fall when i get insurance. my biggest struggle right now is my medication. i'm currently taking zoloft, and it just isn't enough. i will be coupling it with seroquel once i can find an affordable pharmacy. hopefully this will fill the gap. 

current day: family vacations have always been a struggle. my family is a bunch of short fuses, and my baby sister (24) and mother deal with high anxiety like myself. i get my temper from my dad, and my middle sister (26) is just mean. we have never gotten along, especially when confined to day after day of family activities. we have fought all through our childhood, and i was hoping to have a better relationship with her as an adult. (spoiler alert: not happening.)

i know my limits, know when i need a break, know when i need to separate from my family. and when you're in a foreign country (where i currently am), makes it even harder to have that space. 

i'm also half way around the globe, away from my home, my safe space, and 1% milk because apparently that isn't a thing in europe. i also smoke marijuana to help keep my anxiety down. it's readily available in oregon where i live, but definitely not in rome. 

all of this combined, with medication effectiveness that comes and goes, has had my anxiety at a 10 since i left home. 

it's been a long, stressful vacation full of not knowing where we are, not knowing the language, and 8am-8pm days of site seeing and tours. and it has been the most amazing week of my life...but i've reached my breaking point. 

last night i was out having a drink and smoke with my middle sister, her boyfriend, my fiancé, and myself. the two boys leave for a moment, and we had been talking about family and such. i wanted to share with my sister that after our wedding in september, my fiancé and i wanted to try for children. very excited to take this next step, i'm the first to be married, and my parents are so excited for grandkids. 

so i mention this to her, and what is the first thing she says? not congrats or excitement or surprise. her exact statement was, ""what happens if you're on vacation and you get angry? you don't want a baby around that.""

i don't know how i didn't murder her on the spot. my dbt skills came out of nowhere and i explained why. explained how we felt. how my fiancé and i were starting to make serious financial plans to be ready come this fall. how i'm getting my medication figured out so i don't have to pay $70/script. my parents have always financially supported me, and have allowed me to pay $50 less on our rent check to them each month to help cover my meds. (my parents bought my fiancé and i a house, and we are working with a financial advisor right now to get my fiancé and i a mortgage to take over ownership of the house.)

and she just tore me down. questioned every part of my mental health, my ability to take care of myself mentally and financially, and was just so negative. by then, the boys returned and we dropped the conversation. 

i didn't sleep at all last night and cried in the restaurant at breakfast telling my dad what happened. and he looked so incredibly sad. to see me so defeated. and to know my own sister said that to me. 

i stumbled across this sub by accident, and just needed to vent about how my sister made me feel about myself; about an illness i never wanted and never asked for. i was just hoping for some validation that i am capable of being a great mom one day, despite my issues.

help me out guys !,"hello everyone. i am an 18 year old girl. i’ve been struggling with my mental health since a very young age. i always felt like i was different from everyone else and that i couldn’t relate to anyone. but i’m also a middle child with an older special needs brother and a younger sister who was born when i was three.  so i always thought my mental health issues stemmed from the fact i (hypothetically) lacked attention and affection growing up.  i am extremely sensitive and my emotions are insanely powerful. when i’m happy i’m extremely happy and when i’m sad i literally want to die. everyone says i’m an extremely sweet girl but i don’t have a lot of friends.  i have one really close friend and i usually bounce between relationships frequently and i tend to make that person my world and get interested in what they are. i’m really bored with life and often i just stay in my room on the internet.  i was diagnosed with adhd in 8th grade and then depression and anxiety my sophomore year in high school. i am very up and down and i feel like i have no self identity. i’m painfully insecure, but i am getting better. i tend to latch onto people (specifically male romantic interests) and obsess over them in very unhealthy ways until it ends with them being creeped out. i will go on their social media and check what they are doing like very very frequently. more than 10 times an hour i am a very deep thinker and i recently had a short period of time where i was almost convinced i had multiple personality disorder while i was smoking thc. like i was very convinced, and then as the days went by the more unrealistic it seemed to me. i am a very compulsive and obsessive person. i check my phone very very frequently and keep looking at the same things over and over again. it’s really hard for me to stay on task for more than maybe 30 minutes. my mom brought up the fact that i may have bpd today. i read the symptoms and they seem to add up. can you guys help me?? feel free to ask any questions. also i am currently taking wellbutrin and zoloft and may start taking adderall.  i start college soon and i just want to live a normal life, i need your help 
side notes : 
it’s also really hard for me to make decisions like on what to eat and what to wear ect.
and i don’t really have opinions on things

side notes : 
it’s also really hard for me to make decisions like on what to eat and what to wear ect.
and i don’t really have opinions on things

So i talked to a psychiatrist and she said she thinks i have borderline,"but i guess i'm afraid i unconsciously chose stories that would have led to a diagnosis. idk i've felt like i've had bpd since july, but two therapists i talked to said ""untreated depression and anxiety"" and ""attachment style issues"". one straight up said ""yeah so i don't work with those people"" when i mentioned that i resonated with bpd criteria. and then she said ""those people are mean and hostile and give me a bad feeling and you don't do that"". but i also don't think she was the best therapist. or the most professional. lol she talked about her alcohol addiction and about herself so much that i got really infuriated that i was paying her and she was getting more therapeutic treatment than me. 

my current therapist thinks i just have anxious attachment issues since most of my bpd symptoms revolve around my romantic relationships. also he said he ""treats patients not diagnoses"" so he kinda just dropped the discussion completely after that. 

so i kind of feel relieved or happy because i was right all along. but then did i make it seem like i've had it more than i did? i didn't lie at all during the eval/whatever. but sometimes i don't feel like i have bod and maybe i'm just a hypochondriac who wants a diagnosis so she can have an excuse for all my bad behaviors. but also before i even knew bpd even existed, i still had all the symptoms.

this is a ramble. i guess one of the biggest things on my mind is who do i tell? i want to tell my boyfriend(?) but we're on a minimal contact break right now and i don't want to manipulate him into thinking that he should ultimately stay with me bc he pities me and it wasn't my fault that i did all the things i did in our relationship that got us where we are today. and like yeah, i do want him back but i want him to want me for me and not because he pities me and feels obligated or whatever. can't tell my family because they don't believe in mental illness (also because they certainly contributed to it). does it help telling other close friends? 

oh yeah also anyone on lexapro? i'm being started on that now and i'm uncertain if it will help at all. i've tried zoloft but it did nothing for me emotionally. just made me lose my libido and start having night sweats every night for a month. i wanted to ask for an anti-anxiety med (like a benzo) for when i go into those freak out modes and do something rash or start angry texting ""you don't love me or care about me"" yadda yadda. but i don't want to be like ""hey prescribe me benzos pls"" because i don't think that will work. anyone use benzos? do they help if you take them during an episode? i guess if i'm convinced enough that they'll help i might ask... but also yeah yeah i know, gotta learn to regulate on my own, dbt, etc. i'm about to go to a dbt class in like 30 min so chill, i'm doing a lot of hard work on my own too.",1512513290,False,BPD,2017-12-05 22:34:50,"So i talked to a psychiatrist and she said she thinks i have borderline but i guess i'm afraid i unconsciously chose stories that would have led to a diagnosis. idk i've felt like i've had bpd since july, but two therapists i talked to said ""untreated depression and anxiety"" and ""attachment style issues"". one straight up said ""yeah so i don't work with those people"" when i mentioned that i resonated with bpd criteria. and then she said ""those people are mean and hostile and give me a bad feeling and you don't do that"". but i also don't think she was the best therapist. or the most professional. lol she talked about her alcohol addiction and about herself so much that i got really infuriated that i was paying her and she was getting more therapeutic treatment than me.

"Diagnosed with OCD, but doing DBT to address BPD symptoms?","hello all, i'm hoping to get a bit of interaction from this post in the bpd community. 

i've always struggled with mental health. earlier this year i was diagnosed with ocd and it felt like such a relief because it all made so much sense. i joined a few support groups and found myself relating to the others in so many ways. i was doing both cbt and erp, and was on sertraline (for mood swings) and clomipramine (for ocd). 

early november, after weeks of stashing my clomipramine, i overdosed, with intention to end my life. the medication was helping, but the therapy felt like a waste of $400 per month. (among other issues in life, of course.)

a crisis team talked to me in the hospital. i got moved to a community funded mental health thing, where a different psychiatrist saw me and said i need to do dbt after evaluating me. 

she said she was not diagnosing me with bpd but said i have a ton of similarities as someone who has it, and would benefit from dbt instead of erp. 

after reading up on bpd, i relate to it so much. similarly to how i felt when i learned about ocd, i feel this relief like i'm not alone, and these issues are treatable. 

not sure what i'm after in this post. my irl friends don't really relate to the struggle, my partner is supportive but can't relate, and even now my ocd group doesn't relate. i guess i'm wondering if it's possible i have both conditions, or of anyone has any advice for this oddly specific post

This is a disorder you need to take in to your own hands,"this is the most stigmatized disorder. theres aparently dbt and schema therapy, not only are these hard to get in to but they have a high drop out rate.  

seriously the best course of action is to just get a few self help books, one on mindfulness one on dbt and one on spirituality and just work through them yourself.  keep them wherever you spend most your time.  



become obsessed with meditation, diet and exercise and more inwardly focused, get a good friend to monitor you and get on at least one med such as zoloft or abilify and stay on that med.  

the more you work through with meditation progressing from mindfulness to others the more at peace you become with yourself and that's a lot of the disorder eliminated, particularly the lack of identity and feelings of emptiness.

get in a flow state of a balanced lifestyle and try your best to make income from something not too routine.  

one of the best things is to simply take up jogging and yoga or jogging and tai chi, take a holistic approach to yourself as well as the modern medication approach. don't chase relationships be comfortable by yourself with your hobbies and just throw away social expectations. create your own identity and reevaluate your values.  

don't look in to the disorder too much or labels, stay away from sources of negativity and bad influences, set yourself strong boundaries on both what you allow around yourself and your own behaviour.  

*this all works because it's you focusing on you and not you trying to fit in to conditioning and expectations or reversing personality traits.*  

mental health professionals have it drummed into their heads that this disorder is a lost cause and they unconciously take that in to therapy with them.  

the concept i'm trying to propose is don't make it society vs you, make it you against you, work with what you have which is so many tools rather than one or two professions take on things.",1550143650,False,BPD,2019-02-14 11:27:30,"This is a disorder you need to take in to your own hands this is the most stigmatized disorder. theres aparently dbt and schema therapy, not only are these hard to get in to but they have a high drop out rate.

Doctor has no boundaries either,"long time lurker, first time poster.

i was diagnosed with bpd 3 years ago, adhd just recently by a new psychiatrist. i haven't had much luck with psychiatrists nor medications until i started seeing this new psychiatrist and was finally prescribed the right medications. i had no idea just how much better my functioning and overall quality of life could improve until seeing this particular doctor who actually listened and gave me a script for an amphetamine when so many doctors just overlooked my issues. for vyvanse and zoloft, i am so thankful for this doctor. 

the first time i met him, it was at a clinic i have been going to for 6 years. my long time counsellor facilitated the meeting and i felt very comfortable and was surprised at how thorough the doctor was with my case. i was finally optimistic to have a psychiatrist that a) was new and therefore not going to end their practice abruptly and switch clinics or b) continue to treat me for bipolar which i do not have.

now my meetings with this doctor are at the same clinic and one on one. i understand the purpose of a psychiatrist as a medical doctor is not for counseling or the cognitive aspect of my situation. maybe that is why he has trouble reading body language or knowing appropriate action in the mental health field. i know he is a medical doctor and the medications are foremost, but the last 3 times i have seen this doctor, i have left the clinic feeling very uncomfortable and i am not sure what to do.

my doctor repeatedly uses phrases like, ""do not worry, you are young and attractive, you have your whole life in front of you,"" and ""but you are attractive and very intelligent, so you must remain optimistic"" and i feel these comments are so inappropriate to how i already perceive the world as shallow, appearance based and obsessed with female youth. shouldn't he be reiterating other things? shouldn't my youth and perceived beauty have no place in a psychiatrists office? 

i recently started opening up about some trauma i experienced in my childhood. i have never talked about it before and the realizations that what i thought was normal coming of age stuff wasn't normal at all has been extremely distressing to me. i often dissociate when talking about it. the last few times i have seen my doctor, he has said, ""come in for a cuddle"" and hugged me close to him as i was leaving. i don't understand why he does this especially after telling him about something so deeply personal and sexual. i told him how i felt my body wasn't mine sometimes and his response was to hold me to his chest in his office as i was trying to leave. i felt very taken vulnerable and almost taken advantage of. i know i am not supposed to, but i know another patient of his through a support group we attended last year. i asked this person how the doctor comforts her and how the end of their appointments go. she told me he is very assuring and tells her ""there there"" but doesn't touch her ever. i didn't want to influence her therapeutic experience so i just ended the conversation reiterating how helpful he has been with giving me the right medication. 

but my blood is boiling and i do not know how i should respond to this feeling. i am shaking at the thought of him reaching for me and not even asking but stating ""come here for a cuddle"". i am scared to tell my psychologist because i do not want to lose the one doctor who has given me a new life with these medications. i just wish i had the balls to tell him i do not want to be touched, or reminded that my youth and beauty he praises so often are fleeting every second. i am 28 years old. it just feels wrong.

Seeing a new doctor today.,"i'm going to see a new psychiatrist today. this will be the intake appointment, meaning they could ultimately decide to not accept me as a patient. 

i'm hoping that's not the case, as i think i'm in serious need of a medication change. i've been on wellbutrin and zoloft for almost 2 years now, and while i think they help, i don't think i should still be having this severe of suicidal ideations with medication. i don't know. 

i'm also back on medical leave from work. my guilt about that is slowly getting better. i'm thinking of starting a travel blog and devoting myself to that, along with university work to keep myself busy and not end up on the couch every night watching netflix.

not much else to say, other than i'm really nervous about seeing this new doctor and the possibility that they may not want me. fingers crossed.

Getting diagnosed with BPD and your experiences,"so,
hi everyone, this is my first post here and one of my very few on reddit, but i've hit a bit of a wall and want some advice from actual people with bpd instead of some shitty article that someones written with 10% input from people with bpd

so basically, i think i may have bpd? i'm currently on sertraline for depression after struggling for years, and have been so for just over two years now.
even before being diagnosed with depression i thought i was dealing with something a bit more complex. i thought maybe its just depression, maybe its bpd, maybe its bipolar. when i finally went to see my gp, it sort of went
me: hi i'm sad
doctor: here have some antidepressants
and that was it. at the time, i wasn't even sure if i could say i had a diagnosis because it was that vague and dismissive. well a year or so later i went back to the same doctor and expressed, very delicately i might add, that i was concerned that i was experiencing something more than depression, maybe bpd. he essentially told me that i wasn't and didn't even refer me to someone a bit more qualified to make that decision, despite me delicately asking and expressing that things had gotten worse. he upped my anti-depressents and i had another appointment in a few weeks to make sure that i was adjusting 'ok'.
after that appointment, i was fuming, i felt so invalidated and silly. i told my mates that i felt really dismissed and my friend, who's dealt with shitty doctors invalidating her as she was 'too young' to experience the pain she was, told me that if i asked for a referral he had to give it to me, legally. 
well i went to my next appointment ready to put my foot down for my own mental health, at that point it wasn't even about getting a diagnosis, it was about being heard and taken seriously. well this time, when i requested that i be referred to a psychologist or psychiatrist he told me that in our area, they only refer people who have addiction or are dealing with personality disorders, so i wouldn't qualify. yes, personality disorders. the thing i had asked about the other week, but now i wasn't fucked up enough to even see a specialist.
i let it go at that time because it frustrated me to the point of angry tears any time i thought about it.
i wasn't able to get a diagnosis for a personality disorder because they only refer people to the psychologist who have personality disorders?
i have no idea, it pisses me off to this day.

well here we are a year later and i feel like i've been through it. my dad unexpectedly died and i finally committed to dropping out of uni. i've been doing varying levels of cbt therapies over the last year, and i'm nearly coming to the end of the higher level. and shocker, shits getting bad again.

every time i search bpd, i identify with a good chunk of the symptoms. i do those stupid 'do i have (insert mental health condition here)' tests, and i'm always in the red. i just want a bit of confirmation and support at this point.

i can't remember a time when i didn't feel empty. sure, there have been days and even weeks where the hole is a bit plugged but its always there. no matter what coping mechanisms i use for my 'depression' i still feel empty. even if on the outside i'm doing well and ticking all the boxes of being a functioning person, i feel like i'm sleep walking through it and not being real.
my sense of self is non-existent. i'm constantly changing what i like and love, and fixating on something for a few weeks before its gone again.
my relationships with family and friends seem fine, which to be honest they are on the outside. despite my fluctuating feelings for people, i rarely show it? like i don't take it out on them even if i'm furious with them for whatever reason. but in my head people can be on my shit list for really random reasons. for example, my best friend, who i live with is currently so far on my shit list that i've moved home temporarily for the first time in years. she thinks it's just because of covid but 90% of the reason i've moved home is because i can't stand her and her boyfriend, and i don't like her anymore? like i definitely do and i know we'll still be friends but for some reason right now i don't like her, and she has no idea.
everything certain people say seems to hurt, for example my mum. i know she doesn't mean it but 90% of the things she says around me feel like a personal attack, even if its not directed at me. she could comment about someones hair and i would find a way to be personally offended, you know? because to me, why would you comment about their hair when it looks like mine? clearly that's a thinly veiled attack on my hair.
i don't know.
as i'm getting older, i feel like i'm a functioning person, just not for this world? like i can do shit day to day, but i feel so different to the people around me, like everything's on a different level.
i just feel so sensitive and wrong and i'm living in a world not designed for me.
i'm struggling so much with my purpose at the minute. i dropped out of uni this year, as i mentioned before, and since then i feel like i've just been floating. since that time i've started a casual buisness with a friend (that i'm sort of dropping now for no real reason) and written a complete buisness plan for another and just completely dropped it. i've considered going back to uni, for about 4 different subjects most of which i've got no experience in (even though uni was one of the most painful experiences for me). i just feel i've got no identity. growing up school and academics were my entire identity, and when uni went to shit, i've really struggled with that aspect of life and my personality. 
i'm hitting that point again where i don't really want to be here. its not because i want to hurt myself or be dead. i just feel like i'm not designed for this world and i cant seem to function in it. 
i feel i tend to hide my issues quite well despite the fact that i feel devastated and like i'm falling a part inside, and sometimes this means i find it difficult to express that to doctors or even friends and family.

in summary, i feel like i'm the conductor of the hot mess express and no one can see it.

so, i guess, what my point of this post is, i just want to hear about your symptoms, your bpd related quirks and things. i just want to hear more about bpd from actual humans living with bpd, as opposed to a doctor or an article, and also your experience with being diagnosed.

No hospitals will help me anymore,"warning this job long and uneddited. just need arvice if anyone has any. 

i've been a frequent flyer at all the local phyciatric hospitals (all 2.5 of them) since i was about 15 and now that i'm 18 and bpd is officially on my diagnosis sheet i'm fucked. as soon as i try and go in for help i'm turned away and deemed a liar. i can't get into therapy till july i don't know what to do no one will help me anymore so i just shut up about what i'm dealing with and eat my perscribed pills and hope for the best. 

anyone have any idea what i should do. i'm just stressed to the max and don't know where else to go to and not be judged harshly. i have well over 10 hospitalizations but less than 20. most where clustered around when i was 15-16 (2015-2017) and then one very long one when i was almost , 17. then i managed to stay out till april of this year but they sent me to the hospital i hate so i got out with out getting help. then i tried again this month in the 7th but i was on drugs at the time so they refused and tried to send me to a detox place but my hallucinations where so bad i thought the detox place was drugging me so i left a few hours after being there. 

i'm a month sober now but the hallucinations are still bad and get worse when i smoke weed but i need weed to function my meds make me sad and numb. i'm on zyprexa and the only thing making me not want to die most days is my zoloft. i just don't know what to do but suck it up till i start therapy in july.",1558673888,False,BPD,2019-05-24 04:58:08,"No hospitals will help me anymore warning this job long and uneddited. just need arvice if anyone has any.

Should I get a new psychiatrist or wait this out??,"so a couple months ago i went to my psychiatrist because i learned that the ""depression and anxiety"" i've dealt with for 10 years was actually bpd. i talked to the psychiatrist about how nothing was working. therapy and zoloft  did nothing for me. he kinda brushed it off and was like ""yeah sounds like bpd. but you seem to be high-functioning, so you'll be okay.""  i asked if theres any medicine that could help. he told me absolutely not, because it's a personality disorder, not a mood disorder. he said to go to group dbt (which i dont have the time or money for, but i am trying to get into individual dbt). 

but the main problem is i'm not ""high-functioning"". my life is literally falling apart and i have suicidal thoughts daily because of it. i've ruined every relationship i've started. i lost all my friends. my boyfriend of 4 years is now threatening to leave. i've lost everyone.  i feel like i'm barely functioning. i've been trying to get into therapy but nothing works with my schedule, or they dont deal with bpd people.

   each doctor would act the same, overwhelmed, uncomfortable with me, shocked to hear about suicidal thoughts, unable to truly empathize, each with a different guess and prescription. c-ptsd? bipolar? anxiety? depression? there had to be at least 6 people who wanted to prescribe first and ask questions later. finally i snap, and am at an emergency psychiatric centre. the nurse leading the initial interview is the first genuine health care practitioner i've spoken with, i tell them a lot of heavy things, and they react like someone who is concerned for me. it was nice.

   the psychiatrist was an older man, not really there to listen to a young female. he was dismissive, i told him i had a bad experience with medication, specifically antidepressants and antianxiety. he writes me a script for zoloft. i told him i suffer from both night terrors and hallucinations, that the walls were falling in on me or that i was covered in thousands of spiders. i was paranoid and thought people knew what i could think. that i truly believed i was being haunted for over a month before. he said that was normal and everyone experiences that sometimes. he said i might have cyclothymia. low level bipolar disorder. i read online and it doesn't make sense, what he prescribed and what's prescribed for cyclothymia doesn't make sense. i try the medication for 6 months and it does the opposite of what it needs to. now i'm addicted to a medication that doesn't work, psychiatrist cancels my appointments, i go through withdrawals and almost lose my job. again.

anyone else think their therapist judges/hates them?,"so basically i am currently at my second attempt of therapy, i was first in therapy from 13-16, but am now 19 and have recently decided to go again as i am doing quite bad.

i told him in my head medication is my last option as i'm so scared, and i may start taking it when my actual treatment has started (i'm still on a waitinglist). 

thing is i feel he is judging me now whenever i talk about symptoms, and he feels like i am just whining and dont really want to get better. whenever i talk about my obsessions or general anxiety being bad, i can just hear him in my head go 'well maybe you should take the medication then'.

I have NO SAY in my treatment options (UK NHS). Fucking brilliant.,"i just got back from my doctors. here's how i *thought* it would go:
__________________________________
doc: hi, glitterain, how are you doing?

me: not bad.

d: so you're here to discuss meds. i've spoken to your psychiatrists team and they seem to not know what they're doing. i think we'll start you on venlafaxine alongside your mirtazapine/take you off your mirtazapine/try something new. how is therapy going?

m: not well, it doesn't seem to help and the psychiatrists are condescending and unhelpful. are there any other treatment options?

d: well there's the cmht, i gave you crisis numbers, we can try you with x/y/z after this therapy, how's that?

m: great, thanks.
______________________________
end scene.


**here's how it *really* went:**
_______________________________________

doc: hi, how are you?

me: not too bad, thanks.

d: i spoke to your psychiatrist who also spoke to your ex psychiatrist (the one you didn't like who was horrible and didn't help you). we think you should try coming off mirtazapine completely as we need to see what you're like now.

m: what about the withdrawal?

d: it'll be fine, take one every other day for two weeks. here's a prescription for six more tablets.

m: but i had really bad withdrawals with sertraline.

d: it'll be fine, you're only on 15mg. cold turkey would be fine but try every other day to be safe. your pdocs said you should bring this up at group therapy. can you do that?

m: group therapy is awful, the doctors don't listen, avoid questions and don't offer help. we haven't been given boundaries or a decent explanation, we don't even know who the other facilitator is (if she's a pdoc, a psychologist, a nurse, whatever) and they just make us talk to each other.

d: i understand that it can be difficult talking to strangers and the other people in the group make it daunting for you.

m: no, i like the other people fine, we all get on, it's just the facilitators that are the problem. we all agree.

d: okay. well try to bring it up in group?

m: i don't think i can. group isn't working and they won't even tell us if there's going to be any help available after group.

d: well that sounds very frustrating.

m: it is. they call us borderline but they won't even diagnose us.

d: that does sound frustrating. try taking your meds every other day and see me in a month. bye.

doc: hi, glitterain, how are you doing?

me: not bad.

d: so you're here to discuss meds. i've spoken to your psychiatrists team and they seem to not know what they're doing. i think we'll start you on venlafaxine alongside your mirtazapine/take you off your mirtazapine/try something new. how is therapy going?

m: not well, it doesn't seem to help and the psychiatrists are condescending and unhelpful. are there any other treatment options?

d: well there's the cmht, i gave you crisis numbers, we can try you with x/y/z after this therapy, how's that?

m: great, thanks.

m: what about the withdrawal?

d: it'll be fine, take one every other day for two weeks. here's a prescription for six more tablets.

What diagnosis would you guess I have?,"this will be a long text and i would really appreciate it if you guys take your time and read it. i know that you can't diagnose someone based on a text on the internet, but if you could give me some answers what i might have that would be great or give me some sort of guidance.

i have not been to therapy before, i have been suspecting i have add and had an assessment with a psychologist, i was not clean at the time so they could not continue it.

okay so short about my childhood. i was born to two parents from a mena (middle east &amp; north african) country who migrated to a scandinavian country because of war. my parents met through an arranged marriage, my mothers family were very poor and my mom who was 17 at the time was illiterate when they married. my father was more than 20 years older than my mom and i don’t know so much about him except the fact that he was addicted to khat which is a stimulant and it is very common in that area.

when i grew up my father was very abusive in the relationship and he used to hit my mom a lot in front of us kids (me being the oldest). i remember him being paranoid and thinking my mom was cheating and he even threatened her with a knife, i was very scared and defended my mom thinking he would kill her. i was always sleeping with my mom when my dad was angry at her because i was scared of what he would do to her (my mom told me this last part as i got older). this was around the time i was 4-6 years old. my mom told me i was very withdrawn as a kid and i didn’t like getting hugs from kindergarten teachers. i was also bullied a lot by other kids when i started school.

anyways when i was 6 my mom had enough, my dad had a lot of addiction problems. he was dealing khat as a living, was addicted to gambling so he spent most of his money on that. he used to have psychosis when he stayed up too long on khat and was acting very weird and irrational, asking me questions about my mom seeing other men when he was there. he also looked under the bed to see if there was a man under there. around this time i realised he was not sane, i was 5-6 years old. my mom told us she had to divorce our dad and that we were moving, i remember meeting social workers and they were talking to us.

after that we moved away and i started a new school. it was all good. i never had a hard time in school luckily. growing up we had it good, thank god for my mom. she was very supportive and made us feel safe. i didn’t see my dad until i was 11-12 years old i think. i later found out he had a restraining order when i was 15. so that was a little bit about my childhood.

i always knew i would try drugs when i was younger when they taught us about it in school. so when i was 16 i started drinking and smoking weed and i really loved the effects i got. 2 years later i tried mdma and lsd and loved it. after that i tried every drug i could get my hands on, painkillers, benzos, amphetamines etc. i had a problem with amphetamines for awhile but i stopped. i also started abusing weed smoking always daily with friends. also around this time i was depressed and had a lot of anxiety so the drugs helped me cope. when i was not using drugs i was browsing \[[r/drugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/drugs/)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/drugs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/drugs/)), erowid and other forums to read about tripreports and such.

around the time i was 20 i started doing criminal stuff. i was hanging out with people who sold drugs, some of them were criminals (i know it's criminal to sell drugs but they were doing other shit too) and i am a very naive person, or i used to be. i got hustled by a guy and i got angry and broke into his house and stole his stuff. i also started selling weed and liked living the lifestyle. i got into deeper problems and a childhood friend of mine ruined my apartment. i rented it for him (it cost me 800$). i confronted him about it and later we got into a fistfight and he robbed me on my phone. after that he threatened me he would stab me if i tried fighting him again. this was around 2017-2018, i got deeper into my drug addiction. i started having beef with my then girlfriends exs who had guns and were older criminals. i was paranoid all the time looking for people i wanted to avoid and was very hypervigilant so i got prescribed zoloft.

then it went downhill, i started taking steroids and had a girlfriend who was very deep in her drug addiction. our relationship was very toxic (think jesse pinkman with his drug addict gf + fighting a lot). we were using drugs daily, smoking heroin, weed, taking tramadol ,benzos. i was in a bad place. some of my friends started distancing from me, i was still angry with the guy who ruined my appt and i was hunting him. we got into fistfights and i was chasing him down with a beer bottle once trying to hit him in the head (long story). after that i was getting into a lot of fights. i started taking harder steroids like trenbolone (one of the hardest steroids who has very negative mental side effects) while abusing painkillers and smoking weed daily.

me and my girlfriend at the time put an advertisement on an escort site and we lived in my friends appt. i told my girlfriend to talk to them on the phone and bait them to our apartment. when the horny older man (they were usually old) came i was waiting inside the bathroom, i then told my gf to lock the door and say she is going to the toilet. i pulled a knife on them and robbed them on their money and phone. i stopped doing this after one guy started fighting back, i started to think if the sex customers had a knife they would stab me in self defence.

i got into fights a lot and i had a personality change. my family started noticing it but i didn’t care. then in 2019 when i was meeting an older lady (56 years old) from a sex site i was speeding and the road was slippery, i was in a car accident. i almost died but i didn’t have any life threatening injuries. when i told my friends and mom about this they were really worried and concerned, after the near death experience i got a reality check. i was still using drugs until the summer in 2019 when i went to my home country for a month. i decided to quit. i was sober for 3 months which was the longest time in many years. i relapsed but this time i was not abusing drugs like i did before.

in all this time i was studying in university (2016-2020). i graduated earlier this year. i was living a double life but i still did good in school, even though i cheated sometimes. first half of the year my dad got diagnosed with corona and i broke up with my girlfriend. my dad survived but i was still using drugs. i was hanging out with my friends who were all drug addicts. i knew that as long as i lived in my hometown i would be using drugs and waste my life, so i started looking for jobs and have since moved.

since i moved i have been living very calm. except when i met a 53 year old lady through a sex site, she was very out of shape and looked very trashy… the after nut clarity hit and i honestly felt embarrassed. i have a sex addiction problem lol. i have been to thaimassage twice, one was with a older lady 50+, she was out of shape too and bad at sex. i still paid 100$. the second time i requested someone younger, but her pussy smelled like fish so my dick went soft so she gave me a handjob. i then decided thaimassage was not my thing.

on the positive side i have been sober for 1 month and 23 days, i started taking zoloft again 200mg daily. i am doing better, still depressed and anxious but better than before. my memory is also pretty fucked but i am okay with it lol. i have trouble sleeping and waking up every night but it has been so for a long time. it is also because i have started a new job and got a own apt. i am going to start therapy soon, i am honestly a little scared of what diagnoses i have so i have been procrastinating it. but i also know i need to talk to someone about this and i have trauma i haven’t dealt with. so… before i make the contact i would appreciate if someone could take a guess on what i have? i think i have a personality disorder. i don’t think it is narcissistic pd since i don’t feel like i am better than anyone else. i was thinking maybe borderline? or maybe i have bipolar disorder?

some things to mention:

\* i was sexually molested when i was around 5-6 by an older guy (around 12 i think?)

\* when i was in my home country the first time when i was 6 i killed cats. one cat i threw a rock at, the other cat i drowned and my relatives found out. i don’t know how i feel about that tbh. also i put rubber bands on my handicapped cousin arms so she would lose her arm. her mom found out.

\* i was very addicted to videogames as a kid. i played waaay too much, my mom got concerned. i was very asocial. when we got a computer when i got older i always used it. they even had to put a timer on it so it shuts itself down after 2 hours. i found a way to take away the program. me and my mom used to fight a lot because of it and i ran away from our home a couple of times.

\* before i tried weed and alcohol i used to steal my little brothers concerta (he has severe adhd), i was 15-16 around this time. my mom found out that the pills were gone before the prescription date so she confronted me and i denied. after that i stopped for a while..

\* 2017 i was working in elderly care and used to steal oxycontin from older patients. i remember once when an elderly person was in a lot of pain and asked if i could give her the morning medicine earlier. i gave her extra paracetamol instead and later snorted the oxys. i also used to steal all kinds of prescription drugs from the elders i worked with. i knew something was wrong with me and i had no problem doing it and not feeling any remorse..

\* when i was robbing people the first times i was on a lot of drugs and taking steroids. so my excuse was steroids. but i still did it sober when i quit the steroids, and i honestly have no remorse. my excuse is if you buy sex from women you deserve it. and also i have been a victim myself, idk. it’s pretty hypocritical i know.

\* i have it very easy getting obsessed with girls. always had, even as younger. i even remember i had a huge crush on a girl when i was around 6, when she spat on the floor i took her saliva and swallowed it (i know wtf). and i still get stalkish with girls i don’t even know (like the guy in “you” on netflix) and have a very unhealthy obsession with them. maybe borderline?

\* i have had psychosis twice when i took too much acid with the wrong people, once ended in psychiatric care after chasing my friend with a knife trying to kill him….

\* i usually don’t manipulate people. i am a compulsive liar though. i am trying to quit since i have learned people almost always find the truth.

\* i have cheated in 2 of my relationships.

\* i grew up in a very strict muslim family, i a am closeted atheist so i do not believe in god. i had to live a double life growing up, pray, fast during ramadan etc. it was very taxing, but i had to please my mom. i have since moved so i don’t have to deal with that anymore.

\* we never talked about what happened in our childhood or feelings. my mom was very loving though. since a few years back i started bringing it up and my mom is opening up more now. she was even denying about what happened during our childhood but i forgive her, she has a lot of trauma

\* my dad is very manipulative, we don’t have much contact. he is close to 70 and has been close to death many times. i want to forgive him but it's hard, he only wants money from me now that i am working and it is causing a lot of stress. he is a real asshole but my mom taught me not to say anything to him, i once told him he can’t tell me what to do since he didn’t raise me. he started crying and after that i felt kinda bad for him. so i am thinking the last years he is alive i let him live in his ignorance thinking he is a good father etc..

\* i haven’t cried since 2017, after an argument with my mom when we didn't talk for weeks and i overdosed on some drugs in my room (not lethal, no one found out) and i was angry at her and started crying. before that it was many years. i want to cry because it is healthy and i remember the feeling but i don’t know why i can't cry.

\* after the steroid abuse i have hypogonadism (low testosterone), my natural production was fucked. opiates probably had to do with it too. but it has been a while since i checked and trenbolone suppresses natural production up to 18 months, i am living a healthier lifestyle and workout so i think it is better now. but i was feeling really depressed when i found out...

\* after the car accident i didn’t borrow anyone's car for a while since i don’t want that responsibility. now that i work and use the company car i noticed i still am a reckless driver… i drive way above the speed limiting and can’t help myself. i am very impulsive and thrill seeking and it is just a matter of time before i am in a car accident that is fatal.

if you have read all this, thank you so much. most of the things i have not told anyone and i feel safe telling it on reddit anonymously. and it honestly feels good typing this out. there are other things i left out, but i am taking that to my grave.. is it okay to tell all this to a psychiatrist? i don’t want to get in legal trouble. some might get shocked about the things i have done and that i am a horrible person, but i know that already. i want to get help and figure things out before i either die in a car crash or get in jail. i don’t want my family to die this early and leave my family this early, i know my mom would get devastated. also i am not suicidal, i have suicidal thoughts sometimes when i am down but i know that when i am sober in the future and have my life in control i will feel a lot better. i used to have some self-harming behaviour (i didn’t know what it was until a friend told me) when using steroids, drugs and getting into fights. but i hope you could tell me what diagnosis you think i have? or any thoughts? thank you for listening to my ted talk…

tl;dr: there is no tldr sorry.",1601403773,False,BPD,2020-09-29 18:22:53,"What diagnosis would you guess I have? this will be a long text and i would really appreciate it if you guys take your time and read it. i know that you can't diagnose someone based on a text on the internet, but if you could give me some answers what i might have that would be great or give me some sort of guidance.

if you have read all this, thank you so much. most of the things i have not told anyone and i feel safe telling it on reddit anonymously. and it honestly feels good typing this out. there are other things i left out, but i am taking that to my grave.. is it okay to tell all this to a psychiatrist? i don’t want to get in legal trouble. some might get shocked about the things i have done and that i am a horrible person, but i know that already. i want to get help and figure things out before i either die in a car crash or get in jail. i don’t want my family to die this early and leave my family this early, i know my mom would get devastated. also i am not suicidal, i have suicidal thoughts sometimes when i am down but i know that when i am sober in the future and have my life in control i will feel a lot better. i used to have some self-harming behaviour (i didn’t know what it was until a friend told me) when using steroids, drugs and getting into fights. but i hope you could tell me what diagnosis you think i have? or any thoughts? thank you for listening to my ted talk…

I have no idea how to handle this overflow of emotions right now.,"recently my boyfriend (23m) and i (21f) decided that we need to take a break since my bpd behaviors have begun to do more bad than good for us. it stresses me out because i keep wanting to reach out to him in hopes i get a response, but we both know and acknowledge a break is probably what will help best as i start medication and therapy again. he works at an in-patient hospital, and suggested the idea of a break so he would not interfere with treatment since he sees the same people come back all the time on account of not understanding boundaries.

to make a long story short, i really would appreciate any skills i can practice to keep myself busy so i do not hone in all of my focus on this empty gut feeling that overcomes me every waking minute since he and i separated. i am currently starting zoloft and have moments where it helps, and then other moments where i am dizzy and feel worse than i did with no medication. my psychiatrist said eventually she wants to add lamictal  to my plan, but until i get into the deep sessions of therapy i have no knowledge on how to cope. i need to find distractions so i’m not constantly checking my phone at work, home, or school in hopes he reached out to me; on top of that, i just want to get better so i can prove to him and everyone around me i’m not as crazy as i’m feeling lately.",1573994531,False,BPD,2019-11-17 12:42:11,"I have no idea how to handle this overflow of emotions right now. recently my boyfriend (23m) and i (21f) decided that we need to take a break since my bpd behaviors have begun to do more bad than good for us. it stresses me out because i keep wanting to reach out to him in hopes i get a response, but we both know and acknowledge a break is probably what will help best as i start medication and therapy again. he works at an in-patient hospital, and suggested the idea of a break so he would not interfere with treatment since he sees the same people come back all the time on account of not understanding boundaries.

Anyone here comorbid with OCD?,and if so what medications are you taking if any? i have ocd and have had it my whole life. recently i have been researching bpd and feel very strongly that this is what has been going on with me for a very long time. i've looked through a lot of posts on here and relate to pretty much everything that i've seen you guys express. i do know that ocd can trick you into thinking that you have something you don't but i am also certain it's not the only thing i've been struggling with. i take 200mg of zoloft every day for ocd and was taking 2mg of abilify as an add on for depression but discontinued that a short time ago. is it common to have both of these disorders? which medications would you recommend?,1553310035,False,BPD,2019-03-23 03:00:35,Anyone here comorbid with OCD? and if so what medications are you taking if any? i have ocd and have had it my whole life. recently i have been researching bpd and feel very strongly that this is what has been going on with me for a very long time. i've looked through a lot of posts on here and relate to pretty much everything that i've seen you guys express. i do know that ocd can trick you into thinking that you have something you don't but i am also certain it's not the only thing i've been struggling with. i take 200mg of zoloft every day for ocd and was taking 2mg of abilify as an add on for depression but discontinued that a short time ago. is it common to have both of these disorders? which medications would you recommend?,anyone comorbid ocd medication taking ocd whole life recently researching bpd feel strongly going long time ive looked lot post relate pretty much everything ive seen guy express know ocd trick thinking something dont also certain thing ive struggling take 200mg zoloft every day ocd taking 2mg abilify add depression discontinued short time ago common disorder medication would recommend,0.5047091484129183,"['Aripiprazole', 'Sertraline']","```json

zoloft caused hallucinations!!,"hello everyone,
i’ve been diagnosed with bpd 7 months ago and been medicated with 150 mg zoloft.
honestly i haven’t noticed any changes since i started it like not even one bit. so sometimes i would stop taking it for days (i know i shouldn’t but yea) but then go back on it again. 

so last time i stopped taking it was for like a week or less (which is usual time off for me) but decided to take it again cuz why the hell not.

i took my usual dose at night right before bed, but something unusual started to happen. 

my room was pitch dark which is how i like it when i sleep, but suddenly somehow it turned into a red color like i have red led lights on. objects and things appeared distorted and wavy. i saw black silhouettes and blobs. my body had this weird sensation it felt like floating like it’s numb and i don’t feel it but i can still move. it felt like i was oding but i didn’t take an od. the room didn’t feel like my room it felt like a different dimension! i was literally so scared!

this has never happened to me before! i have no history of hallucinations and psychosis. i don’t want to take this medication again. i keep telling my psychiatrist to change it for me as i see no results but he keeps upping the dose and idk what to do!",1636840857,False,BPD,2021-11-13 22:00:57,"zoloft caused hallucinations!! hello everyone,

Help please,"hey,

i'm an 18 year old girl diagnosed with bpd. i've been on 150mg of zoloft for the past 7 months. just started taking 300mg of lithium twice a day so 600mg in total. i also happen to smoke weed a lot because i feel like that's the only time my brain thinks clearly. 

my brain has been so foggy, i can't hear my own thoughts. you know that little voice everyone has in their head telling them wether or wether not to do something? i do not have that little voice in my head. my memory is completely shot, i can't even remember why i've walked into a room most of the time. it's so strange it's like i can't control what comes out of my mouth at all. i don't know if the borderline's getting worse because i'm almost at the age where it starts to worsen

i can't for the life of me figure out why i am feeling like this. could be the weed, could be all the medication, could be just having bpd in general? someone help please. i have tried not smoking but then i just don't sleep for days because i cannot fall asleep.

also i have no motivation to do anything, i feel absolutely nothing no emotion, my anxiety's been getting to the point where i feel like i'm constantly about to throw up for no reason. every time i leave the house i feel like everyone is staring at me and judging me. i'm extremely irritable as well. 

if anyone has experienced anything similar or you've had the same combination of medications i've had, it would be lovely if you could provide some insight because i am so lost and so confused and i don't have a supportive adult figure let alone supportive anything in my life that can help me figure out. god i've never been more lost my entire life.",1591915916,False,BPD,2020-06-11 22:51:56,"Help please hey,

"I feel much happier, but also far more depressed now that I have a boyfriend.","i started dating my first boyfriend a couple months ago. i already love him more than anything in the world. before i was with him i wasn't necessarily actively depressed or suicidal, but i was very empty and lonely. i was kind of drifting through life on auto pilot day in and day out. i didn't really have much to be happy about or look forward to. now that i'm with my boyfriend i've never felt this happy in my life. he makes me feel safe and comfortable and i enjoy every moment i spend with him. being with him has given me a sense of purpose and i now have a future to look forward to.

on the other hand though i have been experiencing really bad depressive episodes. when i'm not with him i feel lonely and i miss him so much it hurts. i can't really find enjoyment in things anymore unless i'm doing them with him or it is related to him in some way. i get extremely paranoid that i am annoying him or that he doesn't like me anymore and it can cause me to literally become depressed until i see him again. something as simple as a change in his tone of voice, going a night without saying goodnight/ily, or even sometimes nothing at all, are all things that can cause me to go into a downward spiral. i feel extremely lonely without him, and i am scared of what i would do if we ever broke up. 

i didn't realize i had bpd until i started dating him. the last time i had a friend/boyfriend was in elementary school (besides a couple online friends). i never realized i had a fear of abandonment this bad. i am sometimes so scared of him breaking up with me that i feel like i should just end things first before he does it. i am usually aware that i am overreacting though, so i try not to act on those thoughts. i also didn't realize how bad and unstable my mood swings and emotions are. before i started dating him i could go from happy to extremely depressed or mad in a split second, but i never thought much about it until now. it's worse now than it's ever been. i can go from feeling happy to feeling suicidal in the span of a minute.

another thing i realized since i started dating him is how low my self esteem is. i already knew i had it bad, but i never knew it was this bad. i can go from liking myself to hating myself so much that i wonder why he even wants to be with me. i trust him fully, and i know he would never cheat on me, but i am constantly scared he will develop feelings for someone else. i feel like there are so many girls out there that are much more attractive, funny, and interesting than me. i am constantly obsessing over my weight, my acne, my hair, and so on, trying to make then perfect for him. i think i've lost about 15 pounds since i started dating him. most of that was in the last few weeks because i have recently completely lost my appetite. i also stopped taking my anti-depressants (zoloft) when i started dating him because i was worried i would gain weight. i try my best not to come off as insecure around him because i know that he finds it attractive when i am confident, but it gets really hard sometimes. i usually just keep to self depricating jokes and that's all.

i am not officially diagnosed with bpd yet but i know for a 100% that i have it. i experience 8 of the 9 symptoms and you only need 5 to even be diagnosed. i have an appointment scheduled in a couple weeks. i really want to tell him about it but i have been waiting until i am officially diagnosed. part of me is just putting it off though because i am scared of telling him and seeing how he will react. his first girlfriend was very clingy and had a lot of mental issues and he's talked a lot about how it was very straining and stuff. i would never try to put my issues on him or take them out on him, but i feel like he'll still think i'm just gonna end up like his ex. i'm aware that a lot of my feelings are just a part of my bpd/anxiety so i try my best to not act on them. i am also worried he won't believe me or that he'll think i am trying to get attention. most of my feelings and thoughts i keep to my self and don't ever talk about them or act on them. i don't think he has any clue how i usually feel behind the scenes, and so i'm worried he won't believe me because he's never really witnessed any of these things first hand.

i feel like telling him would lift a huge weight off my shoulder though. i really wanna be able to be honest with him and feel like i can trust him with this, and i feel like telling him would make me feel a lot better and a lot less alone in this. i would still deal with it alone and i plan on doing therapy after i am diagnosed. i wouldn't put any of this on his shoulders and i feel i shouldn't make it his responsibility to make me feel better constantly. i just want him to know. i feel there are small things he could do that could make me feel better. for example texting me goodnight and that he loves me every night. we do this most nights, but on the nights we don't i usually can't sleep and i think about it until the morning. 

i just wanted to vent and document all my feelings. i'm aware that being this dependant on someone for your happiness isn't healthy and i am working on fixing it. i'm not necessarily asking for advice or responses. i'm aware that my post isn't very different than most other posts on here considering most of what i write about is just classic bpd symptoms. i just simply wanted to get it out.",1610084506,False,BPD,2021-01-08 05:41:46,"I feel much happier, but also far more depressed now that I have a boyfriend. i started dating my first boyfriend a couple months ago. i already love him more than anything in the world. before i was with him i wasn't necessarily actively depressed or suicidal, but i was very empty and lonely. i was kind of drifting through life on auto pilot day in and day out. i didn't really have much to be happy about or look forward to. now that i'm with my boyfriend i've never felt this happy in my life. he makes me feel safe and comfortable and i enjoy every moment i spend with him. being with him has given me a sense of purpose and i now have a future to look forward to.
