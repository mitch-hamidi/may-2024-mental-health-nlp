"Informal survey: What (legal) drugs, if any, 'worked' for you?","hi! so i'm officially diagnosed, tried dbt but didn't follow through , currently in therapy twice a week (logotherapy) with okay-ish results.

i've been advised that since my bpd is fairly extreme (2 suicide attempts, self-harm, impulsive behaviour that's been costly and devastating for both home and work life), that i need to go under some type of medication. i do not present signs of schizophrenia/schizotypal behaviour however.

i have an appointment coming up, but being no strangers to meds already, i wanted to ask you what, if anything, **worked for you.**

my understanding is that there are several types of drugs, sometime used in isolation and sometimes in tandem with others, roughly falling into the following categories:

**mood stabilizers:** antiepileptics, topiramate (topamax), lamotrigine (lamictal), divalproate (depakote), lithium (to a certain extent as it's not a mood stabilizer per say), etc

**ssris:** citalopram (cipramil), dapoxetine (priligy), escitalopram (cipralex), fluoxetine (prozac or oxactin), fluvoxamine (faverin), paroxetine (seroxat), sertraline (lustral), vortioxetine (brintellix), etc

**maois:** isocarboxazid (marplan), phenelzine (nardil), selegiline (emsam), tranylcypromine (parnate)

**tricyclic antidepressants** amitriptyline (elavil, amitril, endep) , nortriptyline (pamelor, aventyl) , etc (note: these are rumored to make things worst for bpd patients)

**antianxiety agents and sedatives:** benzodiazepines of all kinds: diazipam (valium), alprazolam (xanax), temazepam (restoril), flurazepam (dalmane), and triazolam (halcion). note: these are addictive and prone to abuse in a population already prone to abuse so are rarely prescribed for bpd patients.

**antipsychotics (fgas 'first generation' neuroleptics):** thiothixene (navane), haloperidol (haldol), trifluoperazine (stelazine), flupenthixol (depixol), etc.

**atypical antipsychotics (sgas - 'second generation'):** olanzapine (zyprexa), aripiprazole (abilify), risperidone (risperdal), quetiapine (seroquel), lurasidone (latuda) , clozapine (clozaril), etc.

**opiates antagonists:** naloxone, naltrexone, nalmefene, etc (note: these are experimental in some countries)

**others:** rtms, ketamine injections, psilocybin micro-dosage, etc.

**non-medication but electronically/mechanically assisted therapy:** emdr, etc.

any recommendation would be extremely appreciated as i'm at the end of my proverbial tether. thank you so much!",1602953594,FALSE,BPD,2020-10-17 16:53:14,"Informal survey: What (legal) drugs, if any, 'worked' for you? hi! so i'm officially diagnosed, tried dbt but didn't follow through , currently in therapy twice a week (logotherapy) with okay-ish results.

My experience with lamictal/lamotrigine,"this is going to be a very long post because i want to be thorough. when i was researching lamictal before i took it, i found it helpful to read about people's experiences, and i want to cover every aspect i can think of. so here we go.

i have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder for roughly 5 years (although i knew i had it long before that) and have always struggled to gain access to necessary medication. i was initially prescribed wellbutrin and buspirone, then later on lexapro, all of which were not even remotely helpful in managing my bpd symptoms. despite asking multiple doctors about the possibility of a mood stabilizer, my requests were rejected on the basis that i do not have a diagnosed mood disorder. i was frustrated by that, as i know many borderline folks have experienced relief from extreme mood swings and the intensity of their episodes with the use of a mood stabilizer.

two years ago i was prescribed low dose ativan, then xanax, both of which helped mildly at controlling the severity of my episodes (but not the frequency or duration of them). just to be clear, when i am referring to episodes, i mean when i am triggered past any level of higher reasoning and i exhibit temporary extreme dissociative/psychotic behaviors and that last for several hours and, on occasion, days. i know episodes look different for everyone, but i just want to be clear as this is a medical review, lol.

at long last i found a psychiatrist that recommended i start lamictal, a medication used to manage seizures in folks with epilepsy and to stabilize mood in folks with bipolar disorder. he explained to me that lamictal has very few side effects in most people, both short and long term, but that there is the possibility of developing a life threatening rash while adjusting to the medication. because of this, there is a long titration period to avoid that possibility. he also told me that in the 35 years of his practice, he has seen the greatest success rate with lamictal for borderline folks as compared to other mood stabilizers. as a side note, he also prescribed me low dose klonopin/clonazepam to help manage daily anxiety, so keep in mind that might skew my ability to accurately measure how lamictal has helped me, as i am not taking it alone. i take 0.5 mg of klonopin most days, although i do occasionally take 1 mg if i'm having a particularly bad day or an anxiety attack, and i occasionally skip a dose if i feel like i won't need it that day (aka i'm not leaving the house).

while waiting for my prescription to come in, i did some research. i was mostly interested in people's anecdotes, though i did also check out a few studies. the use of lamictal for folks with bpd is considered ""off label,"" so there isn't a tremendous amount of research in that area. i was pleasantly surprised to find that many folks consider lamictal a wonder drug and very few reported negative side effects of any kind. at worst they got the rash and therefore had to end treatment, and for others it simply did nothing. i did not read any anecdotal reports of bpd symptoms worsening. i felt confident in beginning the treatment myself.

i started off taking 25 mg for two weeks, 50 for two weeks, 75 for two weeks, 100 for one week, 150 for one week, and finally reaching the therapeutic dose of 200 mg (which is the dose i currently take).

so, on to the actual review. i have experienced zero side effects of note...no rash, no increased appetite, no more headaches than usual, no fatigue or insomnia. it has always been difficult for me to compare how i'm doing now to the past, as i experience strong emotional impermanence and have almost zero recall of how i've felt in the past to compare to how i feel now. here is what i know for sure:

while i still spiral as much as ever, i have experienced a marked reduction in the frequency and severity of my episodes. i did not notice the change until i reached 150 mg, and at 200 i feel i can actually say there's a difference.

i am used to going from 0 to 100 when there is a strong trigger, and i would say i now go from 0 to 80. that might not sound like much, but to me this is an enormous relief. i feel i have just enough time to even attempt a coping mechanism or two before the episode becomes too severe to do anything but just ""ride it out.""

my only complaint is that it takes so long to titrate up and the changes were so gradual that i personally found it very difficult to know if it was making any sort of difference. i've had to think long and hard about how i'm doing now compared to before taking it, but i feel i can say that it has been effective for me. right now i'm going through some absolutely traumatic life events, and i've managed to stay relatively calm throughout. i am grieving terribly, but so far i've only had one episode when typically i would experience them almost daily when under this amount of stress. to me, that shows a fairly dramatic change.

consider asking your doctor about lamictal if you haven't experienced any relief from other medications. it might not work for you, but beyond the rash the risk is markedly low as compared to other mood stabilizers. i feel it has been quite effective in reducing the severity of my more extreme symptoms, although i have not noticed a significant reduction of milder or comorbid symptoms (aka anxiety, low self worth, thought loops, splitting, etc). as a side note, in no way am i suggesting that that anxiety/splitting/maladative thought patterns are less impactful on daily living &amp; massively painful...but for me personally, i consider them less severe as they are a daily reality that i work to manage but do not cause me the same extreme distress that my episodes do. that's just me, though.

lamictal does not prevent me in any way from feeling triggered, but has given me some space to actually address the triggers and communicate before going nuclear and tearing my relationships to shreds. to me it isn't exactly a wonder drug, but i have been impressed with its efficacy so far.",1628777635,FALSE,BPD,2021-08-12 14:13:55,"My experience with lamictal/lamotrigine this is going to be a very long post because i want to be thorough. when i was researching lamictal before i took it, i found it helpful to read about people's experiences, and i want to cover every aspect i can think of. so here we go.

My first time Inpatient: how I learned to advocate for myself,"hi everyone, i just got released from the hospital after the 72 hours. i signed all the papers to go in voluntarily so i could stabilize and get my meds changed in a safe environment. it's a long story about why i went in but i figured you guys could understand. i've recently been diagnosed bipolar and borderline.

so, i was previously on 40 mg of prozac, 25 mg lamictal and 10 mg buspar. prozac and buspar were part of my old ""anxiety and depression"" cocktail. the first psychiatrist i saw added 25 mg of lamictal to my regimen after my diagnosis and didn't change anything else 

after that appointment, when i got home i felt great. for all of....2 days. my body got used to the lamictal and from there on it was like eating candy. i kept taking the medicines hoping it would get better.

from there, things kept going downhill. i ended up in one of the most severe depressive episodes i've ever had while also experiencing mild psychosis. i had a lot of outlandish thoughts like i wanted to build a makeshift boat and go to india, i wanted to get to paris with a total of 60 bucks in my pocket, really weird stuff. then i talked about hanging myself.

the next day, my family had me go to counseling. my psychiatrist was contacted and told how bad things were yet refused to change my medicine and didn't call for hours. i was still in full blown crazy land so the best option was hospitalization. i agreed to it because i was so tired of feeling like i was.

the hospital was great and i loved the doctors i saw. i remember answering tons of questions. every single doctor informed me that i should not have been on any more ssris after my diagnosis. before being diagnosed, i had tried 7 ssris with little to no success or worsening of symptoms. also i was told the mood stabilizer i was on was gonna be way too slow working. 

the head psych doctor there reevaluated my whole med regimen and took me off of prozac and lamictal and she added lithium and left me on buspar which i do well with. i felt like a new person when i started lithium. it's been totally amazing so far. i have a checkup in 4 days to see my blood levels.

i'm going to do all of my follow-ups with the hospital's doctors which i feel very good about. i feel like i can trust them and they have a lot of knowledge about medications as well as what each mental illness needs to be treated with. i completely cancelled everything else i had with the prior doctor.

overall though, i learned that it's okay to reach out for help. i also learned that i have to fight for myself when my medication is out of balance. it's hard when you're seeing some doctor that's second guessing you and then they leave you hanging when you're in a crisis.  i feel much stronger about advocating for myself after all of this.

i just wanted to share because this community has made me feel like i belong. maybe some of you can relate as well. i feel like everyone here is a friend and i'd love to hear anything you guys also want to share.",1594470067,FALSE,BPD,2020-07-11 12:21:07,"My first time Inpatient: how I learned to advocate for myself hi everyone, i just got released from the hospital after the 72 hours. i signed all the papers to go in voluntarily so i could stabilize and get my meds changed in a safe environment. it's a long story about why i went in but i figured you guys could understand. i've recently been diagnosed bipolar and borderline.

the head psych doctor there reevaluated my whole med regimen and took me off of prozac and lamictal and she added lithium and left me on buspar which i do well with. i felt like a new person when i started lithium. it's been totally amazing so far. i have a checkup in 4 days to see my blood levels.

i'm going to do all of my follow-ups with the hospital's doctors which i feel very good about. i feel like i can trust them and they have a lot of knowledge about medications as well as what each mental illness needs to be treated with. i completely cancelled everything else i had with the prior doctor.

overall though, i learned that it's okay to reach out for help. i also learned that i have to fight for myself when my medication is out of balance. it's hard when you're seeing some doctor that's second guessing you and then they leave you hanging when you're in a crisis.  i feel much stronger about advocating for myself after all of this.

Tomorrow I am seeing my doctor pertaining to my medication and I'm the most anxious I've ever been.,"okay, i just need to get this out. 

so after being diagnosed with bpd i do what i always do and that is dive straight into voraciously reading everything about the disorder. i read and comprehend more and more and more until my head is close to exploding. i've always been this way. it is a pattern close to obsessive. heh. anyway, after all of the information i've absorbed i've drawn a few conclusions about the particulars of my diagnosis. the first and foremost thing being how greatly i am affected by my emotions. the second is how i exhibit no signs of psychosis. 

i'm anxious about seeing my doctor tomorrow because i will be specifically requesting topamax or lamictal. abilify just isn't doing it and that doesn't surprise me since, as i mentioned before, i have no psychosis accompanying my diagnosis. 

i am hoping - no, *praying* and to whom i don't know since i'm an atheist, that he just doesn't try to increase my dosage of abilify. i've read about some of the side effects and how poorly patients *without* psychosis can react if the dosage increases too much. (doing so could result in something called 'tardive dyskinesia'.)

in particular i found this information, and later on [this](http://www.bpddemystified.com/treatments/) entire website, helpful:

&gt; another class of medications, referred to as mood stabilizers, has been shown to significantly reduce certain symptoms in patients with borderline disorder.27 these symptoms include impulsivity, anger, anxiety, depressed mood, and general level of functioning. the size of these therapeutic effects range from moderate to very large.
mood stabilizers do not reduce suspiciousness, split-thinking, dissociative episodes and paranoia in borderline disorder. when these symptoms persist after others improve with mood stabilizers, the addition of an antipsychotic agent is indicated.
the most commonly used and effective mood stabilizers for borderline disorder are topiramate (topamax) and lamotrigine (lamictal). these medications are also referred to as antiepileptic drugs because they are commonly used for people suffering from partial complex seizure disorder. partial complex seizure disorder has its origin in the temporal lobes of the brain, a brain region important in the generation of emotions and control of impulsive behavior.
weight gain does not appear to present a problem with topamax, which may acutally normalize weight in some patients, or with lamictal. the latter medication rarely may result in a serious dermatological problem, especially if the dose is raised too quickly.

i want to be clear that i am sharing this not just to ""get it off my chest"" but in case anyone else out there is experiencing bpd in the same way that i am. i exhibit the following:

* unstable relationships.
* unclear or unstable self image.
* impulsive, self-destructive behaviors.
* extreme emotional swings.
* explosive anger. 
* some/sporadic feelings of emptiness. (i've noticed this happens rarely.)

wish me luck? please? i usually try, and desperately so, to keep it together but i'm on the verge of tears with worrying about how tomorrow will go. it is almost 3:00am here and i should be asleep. that is probably not going to happen.

Lamictal (Lamotrigine) + What Combination?,"okay, right now i am currently on 200mg lamotrigine a day. no side effects other than extremely tiredness, almost somnolence in the evening. which is no problem, because i have had insomnia for years. i do wake up two hours after falling asleep, then i need to go to my bathroom and take a promethazine anti-histamine i was prescribed to fall asleep, and then i sleep until about 6 in the morning (going to bed between 9:30 and waking up 06:00 in the morning.

i can feel the lamotrigine making my mood changes much better. it's still not regulated totally, i still cry from time to time, but now it's like i can't cry. which relieves me alot because i used to cry every day.

but my mood is still changing at at stage where it's still frustrating me and i'm bored to death. still got the feeling the everything i do is meaningless because we're all going to die at one time or another.
__________________________
but, the question is, anybody with bpd that get's a higher dose than 200mg a day? i take 100mg in the morning at 06:00 am and another at 06:00 pm. 12 hours between to keep blood values stable.

and anyone that just needed another medicine like an ssri or something together with lamotrigine, i read that someone needed that. but ssri's have always made me tired, fat and inactive. any ssri's with least side effects?

i also read that an anti-psychotic would work nice together with lamotrigine, especially abilify.
i am not happy about anti-psychotics because it think that i am a victim of long term side effects such as inactive libido, but maybe abilify is better than quetiapin i got for two years and became almost impossible to get an erection.

i also read that lithium does wonders for some people with unstable mood?

can anyone confirm any of this and tell me their ""wonder combination"" to get my motivation and happiness back in life?

looking forward to get some answers.

New medication increase and addition,"hey guys,

little bit of a back story for context:

i've been admitted to a psychiatric hospital due a recent suicide attempt.

before i was admitted i was taking 150mg venlafaxine (effexor) 200mg lamotrigine (lamictal) and 25-50 quetiapine (seroquel prn)

since my admission my doses have been increased to 225mg venlafaxine, 300 lamotrigine and 50ir seroquel and 50xr seroquel note as well as prn 10mg valium. my psych knows that i am recovering from an eating disorder so i am quite picky and choosy about what type of medications i am on, luckily i haven't gained weight since taking the prn seroquel for the past year (it can be on and off, sometimes one or two a night but then i can go two weeks without) she knows that i am concerned that i have increased the seroquel regularly at note, which she reassures me is a short term thing.

so, anyway - the reason for this post is that i have been started on 2.5mg of abilify, creating a large cocktail of medications. does anybody have any experience being on this combination and what is your story?

since my admission my doses have been increased to 225mg venlafaxine, 300 lamotrigine and 50ir seroquel and 50xr seroquel note as well as prn 10mg valium. my psych knows that i am recovering from an eating disorder so i am quite picky and choosy about what type of medications i am on, luckily i haven't gained weight since taking the prn seroquel for the past year (it can be on and off, sometimes one or two a night but then i can go two weeks without) she knows that i am concerned that i have increased the seroquel regularly at note, which she reassures me is a short term thing.

so, anyway - the reason for this post is that i have been started on 2.5mg of abilify, creating a large cocktail of medications. does anybody have any experience being on this combination and what is your story?

thankyou in advance",new medication increase addition hey guy little bit back story context ive admitted psychiatric hospital due recent suicide attempt admitted taking 150mg venlafaxine effexor 200mg lamotrigine lamictal 2550 quetiapine seroquel prn since admission dos increased 225mg venlafaxine 300 lamotrigine 50ir seroquel 50xr seroquel note well prn 10mg valium psych know recovering eating disorder quite picky choosy type medication luckily havent gained weight since taking prn seroquel past year sometimes one two night go two week without know concerned increased seroquel regularly note reassures short term thing anyway reason post started 25mg abilify creating large cocktail medication anybody experience combination story thankyou advance,0.9999902584770190,"['Aripiprazole', 'Diazepam', 'Lamotrigine', 'Quetiapine', 'Venlafaxine']","```json

Lithium and Lamictal,"i've been on lithium (900mg) since 2017 and it's a pretty good base of a medication that helps my main symptoms, but not all of them.
ever since then, i've been on lithium + a thousand other combinations to control psychotic or anxiety symptoms.
since none of them seemed to work, my doctor prescribed lamictal with lithium. in case lithium just needed an extra help from another mood stabilizer.

lamictal worked wonders for me after a couple weeks and i almost forgot i had a disorder in the first place .but i go to a public psychiatric hospital and medications are free and donated, except for lamictal, and i couldn't afford it. unfortunately, i had to stop taking it and got bad for 2 weeks after it until i got somewhat stabilized again (back again with anxiety symptoms but no depression or anger). i went to the hospital again and miraculously could get back into it bc they were able to donate some for me again. but as soon as i started taking it again, i got into such a bad depression i even started cutting again after 3 years of haven't done so. i'll keep taking it since i'm starting to get better again and my psychiatrist might prescribe a higher dose of lithium and drop lamictal completely.

Currently weaning off of Effexor slowly (psychiatrist’s rec. and being monitored) but starting to feel off after a week and a half,"i’ve heard the horror stories and how it’s one of the more difficult snri’s to come off of. i’ve been on 300mg for a few years now and have just had it lowered to 225mg. 

i’m still on my lamictal (god send i swear, i was an emotionally awful person and extremely manipulative before it). 

but the depressive moods and anxiety has been slowly creeping back in.

i’m ashamed to say i’ve missed three days of work because the anxiety was so bad i couldn’t face leaving the house without shaking.

the thing is, i like my job. i like my coworkers and i’m good at my work. i have no reason to feel this way about going. 

i’ve hardly left the house and have a hard time leaving my bed. i’ve been sleeping so much.

i don’t know how much of this is from weaning off the meds, but the goal is to eventually switch me to zoloft.

i feel like i’ve tried everything. wellbutrin, celexa, gabapentin, lexapro, xanax as a prn, klonopin as a prn, seroquel and i’m just tired of the constant cocktail of meds that never seem to help.

the effexor and lamictal have been the best combo so far. but i’m really thinking it’s the mood stabilizers are what’s really working.

it took years for them to even realize i had bpd and prescribe me something for it.

i’m also thinking i’ve been showing signs of add too but my psych. thinks it’s just extreme anxiety. (i know it’s definitely not the cause, fiancé feels the same). but because i don’t talk about it often enough in sessions i’m not sure they’re getting the full picture.

i’m just tired and feeling worthless.

my fiancé has been so supportive but i feel like it’s only a matter of time before i push him away too with all the ups and downs. i feel a lot of shame.

anyone in the same boat who can share experiences or what worked for them?

I don't fit neatly into a box... but that's OK! I'm bigger and better than ANY box you put me in!,"i recently had an episode of sh, chronic emptiness, dissociation, suicidal ideation (without any real intention, just emotionless practicality). i have no clue how many times i've been down this road, but it's as familiar as it is comforting; and as saddening as it is frustrating.

i am, right here and now, a 33 year old female who, 3 years ago, moved from the uk (and utterly shit mental healthcare available on the nhs mixed with a tiny bit of privately paid for, better quality psychiatric care) to australia (private healthcare, incredible psychiatric care, therapy programmes and private hospitalisation available to me 24/7).

when i left the uk i carried with me a 'diagnosis' of possible bipolar disorder and possible bpd, but the only confirmed illness my uk doctors had been happy to label me with was major depressive disorder. i was unable to access the specialists needed in the uk to investigate bpd or bipolar further (despite having been hospitalised for a severe psychotic mania for 3 weeks at one point, and another time disappearing because of delusional thinking for a week and ending up stabbing myself in the leg), and because of this 90% of my care was via my family gp who wouldn't prescribe anything beyond antidepressants. 

as a result, from age 11 to age 29 my life was a complete catastrophe of depression, self harm, multiple suicide attempts, reckless and dangerous behaviour, law breaking, turbulent relationships and catastrophic self image. i am not exaggerating even one ounce when i say i'm genuinely baffled that i survived and didn't manage to complete a suicide attempt, get myself murdered by putting myself (all of 5ft 4 of tiny flimsy female) in horrifically dangerous situations with men i didn't know, or accidentally overdose on one of my frequent cocktails of uppers, downers, psychedelics and opiates.

at that changed when i moved to aus and got private healthcare, as that's just the way here. the move triggered a very dark depressive episode with suicidality and i was admitted to a private, specialist psychiatric hospital for the first time in my life at age 30. that's when i met my current psychiatrist and he took one look at my previous medical records from the uk, literally rolled his eyes so hard you could hear them rattle, and told me he was going to evaluate me again from scratch. i left the hospital 4 weeks later with a firm bpd diagnosis, mdd, and bipolar nos. i also had a drug regimen that included mood stabilisers and drugs to help with my anxiety.

fast forward 2.5 years. at my last psych appointment at the end of last week (emergency meeting to discuss adjusting my drug and treatment regimen after my sh episode (my first for a year, previously unheard of) my pdoc, fiancé and i finally had a really in depth discussion about diagnosis labels, and he explained that the reason he has never labelled me bipolar 1 or 2, although he would be tempted if forced to place as type 1, was for 2 reasons;

1) i seem to have an atypical reaction to antidepressants compared to the vast majority of bipolar patients, as they do not appear to push me into mania. my episodes that could be said to be manic or hypomanic appear to be unaffected by them, and fluoxetine (prozac) is actually currently a vital part of my medication regimen. 

2) secondly, even though i have had two prior episodes that he would definitely call 'manic with psychosis and/or delusional thinking', as i wasn't under his care then and have freely admitted being a raging consumer of illegal pharmaceuticals in my 20's when these both happened, he cannot with complete certainty rule out the possibility of these both having been drug induced, separate to a bipolar episode. 

i appear to have an atypical level of success with certain drugs in general; my bpd symptoms are managed quite effectively with drugs prescribed typically for bipolar disorder and in conjunction with antidepressants and anxiolytics. he thinks this is because of the severity of the depressive episodes i experience which are actually more in line with the mdd or the severity and frequency of depression experienced by type two bipolar sufferers. 

it really got me thinking that ultimately, while obviously useful to a degree in helping categorise and treat our illnesses, these labels which we are assigned for treatment purposes, have a very high risk of becoming the be-all and end-all of how we self identify. i see myself as a borderline/bipolar person, and i have this habit of viewing my entire life and all the experiences within it as being attributed to, or symptomatic of, my illnesses. 

but my psychiatrist explained to me that even he doesn't view me like that. he views me as a collection of symptoms and his job is to try to treat those symptoms in a way that best suits me. so he doesn't give a shit if sodium valproate, or lithium, or seroquel, or lamotrigine, or prozac, or propanolol, or xanax, or diazepam, or even ect (which i have had twice), or olanzapine works best for me. he doesn't care what it's 'supposed' to be prescribed for. dbt or cbt, doesn't matter as long as it helps me. he isn't hung up on labels; his job is to find a solution to best treat all of my destructive or inappropriate symptoms, and from there help me function to the best of my ability in my public and private life. he really made me realise that i shouldn't be so hung up on what my 'diagnosis' is either. we are more than a label. we are all the sum of many parts. we may identify with and relate to each other, but we are all different. our experiences ultimately don't have to fellow the same path. 

what i'm trying to say is that subs and communities like these are an amazing resource of information and comfort from similarly minded individuals. we may share many feelings and experiences. but we are not all the same. and we are not 'just' bpd, or bipolar, or depression sufferers. those are the illnesses we carry with us; but they are not us!

since that chat with my pdoc something inside me has changed. not 'and now i'm miraculously cured!' bullshit; but by changing the way i see myself, as a person first, and having illnesses second, i have been able to recover much quicker from my recent episode than i think i have before. per my pdocs suggestion, i started keeping a list of daily habits and checking them off each day (stuff i would normally do but not even think about it like get dressed, shower, eat, brush teeth etc) and i tick them off every day. it makes me mindful of the positive things i do every day to function as a good, normal human being, and to remember to give myself credit for them!! and then i write down any 'extra' things i do like leaving the house, cleaning out a cupboard or teaching one of my dogs a new trick. it helps me realise that this illness that i feel has taken over my life, hasn't actually won. i'm still inside here, in my head somewhere. i'm still me. i'm not a walking personification of my illnesses. i'm a bright, intelligent, funny, capable person. i'm sexy and i look awesome! i'm a brilliant cook, and i am an excellent 'mother' to my three fur babies. i have good hygiene and cool curly hair that people are envious of. i write well, i read interesting books, i am a fountain of seemingly useless but fascinating information. 

if you're struggling today, and feel weighted down by your diagnosis; if it feels all encompassing and it defines who you are... stop for a second. take a moment to remember that it is a collection of symptoms, and each one has a method of management. it may be something different for you than it is for anyone else. don't come to these subs and forums for the wrong reasons. don't come here to have your negative self image validated. come here for support and to take inspiration from how others find ways to cope so that you can find the right solution for you. drugs, activities, therapy, routines, meditation, creative outlets; every one of us is unique and our management techniques will be unique too. don't lose yourself in your labels. you're so much more, so many more parts than one word or an acronym, just like your illness is. when you refuse to give that label power anymore, you open your mind and your heart to taking on each symptom one at a time. and then you'll start to realise that you are far more powerful than the thing you're trying to fight. 

i want to point out i'm not claiming to be 'fixed' or even that i've gotten anything under control; this is going to take time and constant effort. two days ago i had an episode of rage over a mcdonalds drive thru order that the dumb fucks got wrong and i didn't realise 'till i got home. i smashed a few plates and kicked a hole in a door. but you know what i also did? i managed not to sh, and i still showered, brushed my teeth, walked my dogs, did a load of laundry and later on i baked some ginger biscuits. and all those things went on the 'good habits/achievements' list. 

a day later (yesterday) instead of beating myself up for the rage episode, i focussed on how i still managed to do good things that day, and how now i get to go choose a couple of new plates (maybe even a set!) from target (i love shopping), and how my fiancé went to the hardware store and bought an identical replacement door, pre painted, for $75 and had it replaced within 10 minutes, nbd. 

if you read this far, i hope my story helps you in some way to strengthen your resolve to never stop fighting, to give yourself permission to make mistakes, and to give yourself credit for even the tiniest things. because every positive and productive thing you do, even just combing your hair or washing up a cup, is one thing your illness didn't stop you doing today. start adding all those little things up, and you'll start to realise you're so much more than a mentally ill person. that doesn't mean it'll ever go away. for most of us this is for life. but it means a happier life where you are in control of your illness. not the other way around.

i want to point out i'm not claiming to be 'fixed' or even that i've gotten anything under control; this is going to take time and constant effort. two days ago i had an episode of rage over a mcdonalds drive thru order that the dumb fucks got wrong and i didn't realise 'till i got home. i smashed a few plates and kicked a hole in a door. but you know what i also did? i managed not to sh, and i still showered, brushed my teeth, walked my dogs, did a load of laundry and later on i baked some ginger biscuits. and all those things went on the 'good habits/achievements' list. 

a day later (yesterday) instead of beating myself up for the rage episode, i focussed on how i still managed to do good things that day, and how now i get to go choose a couple of new plates (maybe even a set!) from target (i love shopping), and how my fiancé went to the hardware store and bought an identical replacement door, pre painted, for $75 and had it replaced within 10 minutes, nbd. 

if you read this far, i hope my story helps you in some way to strengthen your resolve to never stop fighting, to give yourself permission to make mistakes, and to give yourself credit for even the tiniest things. because every positive and productive thing you do, even just combing your hair or washing up a cup, is one thing your illness didn't stop you doing today. start adding all those little things up, and you'll start to realise you're so much more than a mentally ill person. that doesn't mean it'll ever go away. for most of us this is for life. but it means a happier life where you are in control of your illness. not the other way around.

Afraid of switching medications,"hi all,
i know this topic gets mentioned a lot, but i was looking for some support/experiences. 

i’ve been on prozac 80mgs daily for about two years now. it was the first medication i was prescribed, even before i was officially diagnosed with bpd. it has definitely helped my overall mood, but now my psychiatrist wants to stop the prozac and start something new (specifically abilify). 

my anxiety has been out of control in the last few months, and she believes the prozac may have something to do with that. i also take buspar 30mgs twice a day, which is great, but if i don’t take it my anxiety is almost crippling. 

does anyone have any experiences with abilify, or any other antidepressants that have worked for them? i’m sincerely afraid to stop the prozac because of how bad things were before i started taking it. i know i’m probably being a baby here, but any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

edit: i felt i should mention the meds i’m already on for reference.

Can meds help with dissociation and derealisation?,"i've got a question for y'all, is there any medication that has helped with your dissociation and/or derealisation??

i've been struggling real bad lately and i'm currently 3 weeks on venlafaxine (effexor), quetiapine (seroquel) and lamotrigine (lamictal), so obviously that hasn't really kicked in yet and i'm not even on the full dose of lamotrigine (upping that in 9 days).

has anyone had any luck with meds working for this??

edit: according to a bunch of studies i googled lamotrigine + snri or ssri antidepressants can reduce depersonalisation and derealisation

and also quetiapine can do that as well

medication recs? (I know everyone is different),"just wanted some opinions and at least get familiar with some of these meds. i was only being treated for anxiety/depression, so i've never tried anything other than an ssri/benzo combo. my old pdoc thought i was bipolar ii and put me on 150mg of lamictal, but all i think it did was decrease my happiness threshold.

i fully tapered off prozac around march and i'm looking for a new med to add to the lamictal (we didn't discuss going off of it completely). i was on ssri's since 7th grade (zoloft, lexapro, prozac) and after going off of prozac at 23, i feel like i just put contacts in for the first time. it has been out of my system and i'm shocked at how much more human i feel. i told my pdoc i never wanted to touch an ssri again, but i went from not crying at all to having these episodic spells, my social anxiety is at an all time high, and i can't stop drinking to ease it. having my sex drive/feelings of intimacy back in particular is an important factor because my past relationships have suffered from it. 

are there any meds that have a better tradeoff -as in they can help my panic disorder without making me a zombie? xanax is a miracle drug for me but after abusing it for a few days during one depressive episode, i'm probably not going to be prescribed a benzo.

Was recommended Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT) - My entire perception of my psych problems has shifted.,"hello everyone. little background, i'm diagnosed bipolar (personally disagree despite 3 diagnoses) &amp; have considerably severe treatment resistant depression. i also have complex ptsd and a lot of borderline traits. i've been through about 4 different therapists, completed individual dbt, and am currently in a dbt skills group. i take 300mg wellbutrin for depression and 100mg lamictal as a mood stabilizer. i no longer feel as though i am taking any medication, and i don't get out of bed until i have to go to work. my suicidal ideation is worse than ever; it seems i think about killing myself almost every 3 hours. i'm having trouble showering consistently and have disconnected from most of my friends. i torment my boyfriend almost daily despite the dbt and my seemingly constant consumption of buddhist/shambhalic texts.


needless to say, i'm afraid i'm running out of options.


i started seeing a new therapist at my dbt center this week who is trained in radically open dbt, or ro-dbt. ro-dbt has essentially the opposite goal of standard dbt, in that it encourages open emotional expression as opposed to emotion regulation, and is for ""overcontrolled"" people (cluster c - avoidant, ocd) instead of ""undercontrolled"" (b - bpd, narcissistic, etc.). because i have extreme bouts of anger to the point of screaming and breaking things, it's pretty needless to say that i've never considered this kind of therapy.


initially they thought that prolonged exposure therapy for trauma would be best, as i felt my reactions to my environment stemmed from my childhood trauma (neglect, addict parents, etc.). however, during my first session, the therapist was extremely interested in what my reactions were in response to rather than the reactions themselves. she asked me about how i can't focus when the dog makes mouth sounds, how i can't let it go if my boyfriend leaves his guitars in the center of the room, and how i can't get anything accomplished because i get so distracted by details - i.e. going to take a shower and spending 20 minutes making a ""shower playlist"" to hear the perfect songs.

i know i'm uptight and can be a perfectionist, however, i haven't completed my ba because i keep dropping out (due to depression), i do and have done a lot of drugs, i drink a lot, am and have always been promiscuous and generally impulsive. perfectionists are successful, right? i'm a broke waitress. i can't even get out of bed. i give up on everything i begin. i'm also a compulsive oversharer, it's a joke among my co-workers and people that know me that i would read everyone my diary if i had the chance. i connect with people all the time. 


then the therapist asked me, “how do you feel when you’re telling people these personal things? do you feel closer to them? do you feel connected to them?” 
i realized i don’t. 


i still feel very far away from people despite my frantic attempts at intimacy. i tell them all about myself but i’ll laugh or smile when talking about childhood trauma or sexual assault. she explained that you can share without connecting, especially when your emotional expression doesn’t fit the words. i’m saying vulnerable things because i’m terrified of actually being vulnerable. this is why i drink so much socially, and why i will do drugs socially. which even so, i’ve been told i’m a reserved drunk, and that i’m a serious person albeit a very funny one. i am constantly aware of my appearance and generally find myself unattractive despite being told i’m beautiful and getting considerable attention for my appearance throughout my adult life. i’ve had an on-again-off-again eating disorder for over 10 years and a relentless preoccupation with my weight despite being .1 above the underweight bmi. i won’t try new things around people, i never feel like i let loose. if one thing goes wrong i abandon a project. i was once asked to do vocals for a band and had to drink vodka beforehand and would still be singing too quietly, i was terrified and frozen. i refuse to practice anything around anyone.



she suggested that my depression and mood disorder could possibly stem from being overly controlled, that because i can’t let loose and i feel like things absolutely have to be a certain way, i paralyze myself and can’t progress. she suggested that this is why i haven’t pursued a career and why i have never shared my creative writing. on a lighter note, that this is why i refuse to do karaoke. 


she also suggested that the reason i explode on my boyfriend, and those in the past, is because they are the ones to actually see me vulnerable. i no longer have total control over my living environment. he see me in my pajamas on the couch at noon. he sees me sleep past 1. i can’t posture myself around him. so i am scared and i resent him. he’s going to leave me because he knows what i’m actually like. 


i spent the rest of the day in shock. i’m still processing it, which is partially why i wrote this. i’m starting ro-dbt next week.

hello everyone. little background, i'm diagnosed with bipolar 2 (personally disagree that i have bipolar at all despite 3 diagnoses) &amp; have considerably severe treatment resistant depression. i also have complex ptsd and a lot of borderline traits. i've been through about 4 different therapists, completed individual dbt, and am currently in a dbt skills group. i take 300mg wellbutrin for depression and 100mg lamictal as a mood stabilizer. i no longer feel as though i am taking any medication, and i don't get out of bed until i have to go to work. my suicidal ideation is worse than ever; it seems i think about killing myself almost every 3 hours. i'm having trouble showering consistently and have disconnected from most of my friends. i torment my boyfriend almost daily despite the dbt and my seemingly constant consumption of buddhist/shambhalic texts.


needless to say, i'm afraid i'm running out of options.


this week i started seeing a new therapist at my dbt center who is trained in radically open dbt, or ro-dbt. ro-dbt has essentially the opposite goal of standard dbt, in that its emphasis is on encouraging open emotional expression as opposed to emotion regulation, and is for ""overcontrolled"" people (cluster c - avoidant, ocd) instead of ""undercontrolled"" (b - bpd, narcissistic, etc.). because i have extreme bouts of anger to the point of screaming and breaking things, it's pretty needless to say that i've never considered this kind of therapy.


initially they thought that prolonged exposure therapy for trauma would be best, as i felt my reactions to my environment stemmed from my childhood trauma (neglect, addict parents, etc.). however, during my first session, the therapist was extremely interested in what my reactions were in response to rather than the reactions themselves. she asked me about how i can't focus when the dog makes mouth sounds, how i can't let it go if my boyfriend leaves his guitars in the center of the room, and how i can't get anything accomplished because i get so distracted by details - i.e. going to take a shower and spending 20 minutes making a ""shower playlist"" to hear the perfect songs. she was especially interested in the fact that none of my friends seem to believe i have mental health problems, because aside from lapses in my social involvement, i seem fine when i’m actually around everyone, despite my many explanations and admissions of my struggles at home. i only explode around my boyfriend, never at work, never at school, never with anyone other than him and every other boyfriend. i considered this a borderline trait, but she seemed extremely surprised that i can go from a huge fight, screaming and crying, then appear at work 15 minutes later and be able to chit chat with co-workers, despite secretly wanting to die. this is generally my life, i feel very uncomfortable and different, but i’m good at being funny, talking expressively, and making self-deprecating jokes.


i know i'm uptight and can be a perfectionist, however, i haven't completed my ba because i keep dropping out (due to depression), i do and have done a lot of drugs, i drink a lot, am and have always been promiscuous and generally impulsive. perfectionists are successful, right? i'm a broke waitress. i can't even get out of bed. i give up on everything i begin. i'm also a compulsive oversharer, it's a joke among my co-workers and people that know me that i would read everyone my diary if i had the chance. i connect with people all the time. 


then the therapist asked me, “how do you feel when you’re telling people these personal things? do you feel closer to them? do you feel connected to them?” 
i realized i don’t. 


i still feel very far away from people despite my frantic attempts at intimacy. i tell them all about myself but i’ll laugh or smile when talking about childhood trauma or sexual assault. she explained that you can share without connecting, especially when your emotional expression doesn’t fit the words. i’m saying vulnerable things because i’m terrified of actually being vulnerable. this is why i drink so much socially, and why i will do drugs socially. which even so, i’ve been told i’m a reserved drunk, and that i’m a serious person albeit a very funny one. i am constantly aware of my appearance and generally find myself unattractive despite being told i’m beautiful and getting considerable attention for my appearance throughout my adult life. i’ve had an on-again-off-again eating disorder for over 10 years and a relentless preoccupation with my weight despite being .1 above the underweight bmi. i won’t try new things around people, i never feel like i let loose. if one thing goes wrong i abandon a project. i was once asked to do vocals for a band and had to drink vodka beforehand and would still be singing too quietly, i was terrified and frozen. i refuse to practice anything around anyone.



she suggested that my depression and mood disorder could possibly stem from being overly controlled, that because i can’t let loose and i feel like things absolutely have to be a certain way, i paralyze myself and can’t progress. she suggested that this is why i haven’t pursued a career and why i have never shared my creative writing. on a lighter note, that this is why i refuse to do karaoke. 


she also suggested that the reason i explode on my boyfriend, and those in the past, is because they are the ones to actually see me vulnerable. i no longer have total control over my living environment. he see me in my pajamas on the couch at noon. he sees me sleep past 1. i can’t posture myself around him. so i am scared and i resent him. he’s going to leave me because he knows what i’m actually like. 


i spent the rest of the day in shock. i’m still processing it, which is partially why i wrote this. i’m starting ro-dbt next week.

this will be long, i'm sorry 


earlier this year, i was admitted to a mental hospital and diagnosed with bpd. i was put on seroquel, 50mgs, immediate release. i liked the slight stabilization and reduction in episodes but i didn't feel like the 50mgs was doing just too much, so a few months later i talked to my psychiatrist to get it adjusted. she prescribed me an additional dose of extended release seroquel at 50mgs as well. so i was taking 100mgs, half extended, half immediate.


getting the dose upped amplified all of my negative side effects, such as dissociation, irritability, loss of sense of self, and especially weight gain. i went from 141lbs to 161 in two weeks. it just made me feel so. out of my body. worse, and in a different way, than usual. i quit taking the extended release, then saw the doctor to talk about not taking seroquel anymore. 

now i am on lamictal, or lamotrigine, and taking bigger doses each week. i took 25mg the first week, 50mg this week, etc, until i get to 100mg. at 75mg, i am to stop taking my seroquel, and instead start taking 25mg of trazodone, for my lucid dreaming/inability to fully sleep. i've done some research and saw it's qualified as an antidepressant and sedative. i've also read that it can react weird with pill form birth control, which i take (chateal)

Mood stabilizer for BPD,"hello, my girlfriend has bpd and cyclothymia and she's worried her psychiatrist isn't very helpful. she started taking oxcarbazepine instead of lamictal and she wants some answers to understand what is best for her.

she has a few questions about oxcarbazepine:

1) many people suffering from bpd take oxcarbazepine at 150mg. is that enough as a mood stabilizer, or does she need to raise/lower the dosage?

2) she's been taking it for almost a week. how long before she will start feeling the effects? 

**the following questions apply to both lamictal and oxcarbazepine:**

3) if side effects should occur, when do they start appearing and are there any that she should worry about and maybe therefore quit taking it?

4) what is the half-life of the drug and how long are its effects?

5) are there any blood tests that need to be taken to make sure she stays healthy (like with lithium)?

6) are there any advantages or disadvantes between using oxcarbazepine or lamictal.

"So, I’m struggling again. Here’s me story. *TRIGGERING*","so i have bpd (obviously), with severe clinical depression and whole lot of anxiety sprinkled into the mix. i’m only on lovan (fluoxetine) 40mgs a day. i have previously been on many different antidepressants/anti anxiety medications in the past. as well as being on antipsychotics/mood stabilisers. 

i first started on lovan when i was 16 after i tried to kill myself and was diagnosed with severe clinical depression and generalised anxiety disorder, i was removed from school and pretty much stayed inside for months under the supervision of mum. (i’m not close to my mum, so it was extra shit). after those months i went back to school, stayed on the lovan but on a higher dosage, went to a psychologist regularly until i was 17 and left school. met someone, moved out with him, he treated me like i’m as his property, i didn’t know any better, he used me, mentally abused me, raped me quite often, even when i was crying and begging him to stop. i couldn’t face my parents because i wasn’t close to my mum and i know that they would’ve been disappointed with my choices so i kept quiet. 

so before then i went from lovan, to cipramil, to prestique. i also got prescribed antipsychotics for short term problems. people were always ‘accusing’ me of having bipolar disorder and saying that no one will ever love me because i’m crazy and that my brain isn’t wired up properly (which were the words of my abusive boyfriend which was another reason why i didn’t leave because i felt like i wasn’t good enough for anyone else). 

pretty much since then, i have been on different medications, blaming them for me being depressed even though it was my surroundings, but i refused to admit it. i had different things happen with a lot of trauma, a lot of moving, being kicked out a lot, being abused. i finally got the courage to leave him and moved back in with my parents.

i met someone at a party and ended up in relationship with him for a bit over 3 years. he was mentally unwell, and we were both just getting worse and worse, we loved each other so fucking much but we tore each other a part. we fought all of the time, screaming matches, pushing each other, hitting each other. this was from 2013 - 2016. i got a new job in 2015 in a nursing home, day shifts and afternoon shifts, i started to get really shit at my job, so it was obvious that my home life was affecting my work life. 

i got on effexor in 2016 and then the doctors diagnosed me with bpd shortly after and started to prescribe me with valium. 

it was good for when i was overwhelmed with my moods and feelings, but god it made me really cloudy. i left my boyfriend of over 3 years, i told him i didn’t love him anymore even though i still did but i hated my life with him so i had to rip the bandaid off. 

work got better, i starting work afternoons and the nights, i got my license and a car and things were going well. though i did start sleeping with a lot of random guys and really craved the attention of men. 

i got kicked out of home, moved into a share house, i then started drinking heavily, smoking, working only night shifts (nursing home), slept with a lot more people, went to night clubs and did quite a bit of pot (this was until 2017). i then quit my job, packed all of my belongings into my car and moved up the coast to live and i attempted to study enrolled nursing while i was away. i didn’t know anyone up there, i lived with a roommate and i couldn’t get work and had to go on welfare. 

my mental health had gotten really bad, i could no longer study, i was very suicidal and had regular hospital trips but they wouldn’t admit me because ‘i wasn’t bad enough and they didn’t have enough beds’ so i pretty much was drugged up most of the time and sent home, i was absolutely miserable. i 

attended a place where i had to go to continue to get my welfare money, which was good because i met other people that had mental health issues too and they provided job training and opportunities for us. the people were beautiful, i loved them and it was nice. 

i then started dbt at the hospital there on weekly basis. 

but then i met someone and it went down hill very quickly (he had a lovely family and they were very warm which made it harder for me to leave him, i was closer to his family than my own). he was extremely toxic and he was quite abusive to me mentally and physically. but he was obsessed with me and wouldn’t let me go and would always go to my house even when i didn’t want him there, he was always there, my roommate hated him. it took a long time and but i finally got out of it and away from him after he got drunk one night, chased after me up the hall at his house picked me up and threw me across the room. i had to run home with my things and call a taxi to my place just to get away from him.

now during this period i was still on effexor, but i went from 150mgs to 225mgs and i was on respiridone which knocked me around big time. i was super cloudy, i couldn’t drive anywhere i couldn’t attend places that i was meant to attend because i could hardly walk to the bloody bathroom. but i slowly got used to it and i was slowly getting better to be able to drive again and to attend the places that i needed to attend. 

then i didn’t have enough money to register my car, so i ended up being alone again, in a place where i knew no one else but my room mate and a couple of people at the hospital that i attended dbt. i still had no job, i now had no car and the public transport there was atrocious. so i got really suicidal again from being isolated and i ended up in hospital and then was transferred to public mental health unit even further up the coast. 

while i was in the mental health unit, they weened me off effexor and respiridone in a matter of days and put me on lovan and lamotrigine. it was horrendous, the side effects were horrible from withdrawing from 2 meds and going on 2 other meds, i threw up every day, hardly ate anything, cried constantly until they gave me some valium to shut me up for a few hours. my parents came and took me back to my home town and i had to stay with them for a while. i got a used car (thanks to my grandfather), i got help and travelled back up the coast to retrieve the rest of my things and ended the lease on the house where i was staying up there. i was getting used to my medications and things were ok. (this was mid 2018).

late 2018 i met someone, but i took it extra slow, i wasn’t ready and he respected that (but i really think he had a thing for girls with issues and it kind of weirded me out so i kept my distance). but he was there when i needed him and was absolutely caring, very trust worthy and i couldn’t ask for anything else in a friend who i did end up being in a relationship with, we are now together and are best friends. 

we moved to a few places and finally settled in our own place with just us 2 in late 2019, i’m now only on lovan and things are ok, i have a new job and a new car and so does he. we got a cat and everything’s ok. 

but my brain won’t shut up, i’m getting agitated again, i’m getting really sad again, and i have turned back to drinking heavily everyday after work to sedate myself. except last night i drunk that much that i couldn’t go to work today and i am disgusted with myself. 

i don’t want to go back on antipsychotics, i can’t go to a higher dosage on lovan. i can’t go on effexor because my highs are way to dangerous when i’m on it and i do horrible things when i’m manic. i don’t know what to do, everything’s ok around me but my brain is still not wired right. 

i dream about my past vividly a lot, i’m always dreaming of running away again, and i like getting into my car and driving far away and coming back the late afternoon or the next day. i’m obsessed with getting away and driving and running. but i don’t want to anymore, every thing is ok, i’m in a very good spot and i just don’t understand why this is happening all over again. i’ve never trusted anyone more in my entire life, he treats me so well and we are so close. i don’t get it.",1582079701,FALSE,BPD,2020-02-19 02:35:01,"So, I’m struggling again.

i got kicked out of home, moved into a share house, i then started drinking heavily, smoking, working only night shifts (nursing home), slept with a lot more people, went to night clubs and did quite a bit of pot (this was until 2017). i then quit my job, packed all of my belongings into my car and moved up the coast to live and i attempted to study enrolled nursing while i was away. i didn’t know anyone up there, i lived with a roommate and i couldn’t get work and had to go on welfare. 

my mental health had gotten really bad, i could no longer study, i was very suicidal and had regular hospital trips but they wouldn’t admit me because ‘i wasn’t bad enough and they didn’t have enough beds’ so i pretty much was drugged up most of the time and sent home, i was absolutely miserable. i 

attended a place where i had to go to continue to get my welfare money, which was good because i met other people that had mental health issues too and they provided job training and opportunities for us. the people were beautiful, i loved them and it was nice. 

i then started dbt at the hospital there on weekly basis. 

but then i met someone and it went down hill very quickly (he had a lovely family and they were very warm which made it harder for me to leave him, i was closer to his family than my own). he was extremely toxic and he was quite abusive to me mentally and physically. but he was obsessed with me and wouldn’t let me go and would always go to my house even when i didn’t want him there, he was always there, my roommate hated him. it took a long time and but i finally got out of it and away from him after he got drunk one night, chased after me up the hall at his house picked me up and threw me across the room. i had to run home with my things and call a taxi to my place just to get away from him.

now during this period i was still on effexor, but i went from 150mgs to 225mgs and i was on respiridone which knocked me around big time. i was super cloudy, i couldn’t drive anywhere i couldn’t attend places that i was meant to attend because i could hardly walk to the bloody bathroom. but i slowly got used to it and i was slowly getting better to be able to drive again and to attend the places that i needed to attend. 

then i didn’t have enough money to register my car, so i ended up being alone again, in a place where i knew no one else but my room mate and a couple of people at the hospital that i attended dbt. i still had no job, i now had no car and the public transport there was atrocious. so i got really suicidal again from being isolated and i ended up in hospital and then was transferred to public mental health unit even further up the coast. 

while i was in the mental health unit, they weened me off effexor and respiridone in a matter of days and put me on lovan and lamotrigine. it was horrendous, the side effects were horrible from withdrawing from 2 meds and going on 2 other meds, i threw up every day, hardly ate anything, cried constantly until they gave me some valium to shut me up for a few hours. my parents came and took me back to my home town and i had to stay with them for a while. i got a used car (thanks to my grandfather), i got help and travelled back up the coast to retrieve the rest of my things and ended the lease on the house where i was staying up there. i was getting used to my medications and things were ok. (this was mid 2018).

late 2018 i met someone, but i took it extra slow, i wasn’t ready and he respected that (but i really think he had a thing for girls with issues and it kind of weirded me out so i kept my distance). but he was there when i needed him and was absolutely caring, very trust worthy and i couldn’t ask for anything else in a friend who i did end up being in a relationship with, we are now together and are best friends. 

we moved to a few places and finally settled in our own place with just us 2 in late 2019, i’m now only on lovan and things are ok, i have a new job and a new car and so does he. we got a cat and everything’s ok. 

but my brain won’t shut up, i’m getting agitated again, i’m getting really sad again, and i have turned back to drinking heavily everyday after work to sedate myself. except last night i drunk that much that i couldn’t go to work today and i am disgusted with myself. 

i don’t want to go back on antipsychotics, i can’t go to a higher dosage on lovan. i can’t go on effexor because my highs are way to dangerous when i’m on it and i do horrible things when i’m manic. i don’t know what to do, everything’s ok around me but my brain is still not wired right. 

i dream about my past vividly a lot, i’m always dreaming of running away again, and i like getting into my car and driving far away and coming back the late afternoon or the next day. i’m obsessed with getting away and driving and running. but i don’t want to anymore, every thing is ok, i’m in a very good spot and i just don’t understand why this is happening all over again. i’ve never trusted anyone more in my entire life, he treats me so well and we are so close. i don’t get it.",i’m struggling here’s story triggering bpd obviously severe clinical depression whole lot anxiety sprinkled

Please someone tell me it gets better...,"i was diagnosed with bpd back in 2016 but didn’t really think i had it. my ex was diagnosed with it later that year or maybe the following year and i watched her go through hell so i figured “there’s no way i have that, i’m nothing like her”. wellll after we broke up i learned a lot about it and what do you know, i fucking have it. anyway, i’ve always been on an antidepressant and then got put on latuda back in 2018 when i fell into a depression after an old classmate from high school ended his life. i was depressed for probably 6 months and then was stable for about 2.5 years. back in may i started using nicotine and then became addicted for a couple months until i was laying in bed and had this out of body panic attack and i freaked out and blamed it on the nicotine so i quit cold turkey (bad idea). at this time i was drinking and smoking a little weed but not a lot of both. then i just spiraled into this deep dark depression/existential crisis. it’s almost been 3 months and at this rate i feel like it’s getting worse. my psychiatrist put me on lamictal but i know it takes weeks to kick in which sucks. she took me off of latuda and put me on 100mg of seroquel but i feel like it’s making me have crazy anxiety so we’re going back to latuda. seroquel doesn’t even knock me out like wtf. so right now i’m taking 20mg of paxil (that i don’t even think works anymore), 25 of lamictal (until we find a higher dose that works), and 20 of latuda. i have an appointment with a therapist on tuesday who knows dbt and i know i need to start that. 

what brings me on here is i went to admit myself today to a psychiatric hospital and they wouldn’t take me!! that’s so fucked up. i told the doctor i wanted to kill myself and had access to do so and he gave me outpatient resources that i can’t even go to until monday and told me to follow up with my doctor. the us’s medical system is a joke. they don’t care. 

do any of you ever fall into random deep depressions like this that are usually triggered by something? can medicine help that? i’ve been stable pretty much my whole life for the most part and have always been able to bounce back from negative emotions. this is probably only the 2nd time i’ve ever been depressed but this is the worst it’s ever been. 

someone send words of encouragement please. i don’t want to live like this forever. all my brain keeps thinking about is dying and it’s so fucking scary. i mean i’ve always thought about it my whole life but it’s mostly just been passing thoughts. i feel like the thoughts are so loud right now.",1610240496,FALSE,BPD,2021-01-10 01:01:36,"Please someone tell me it gets better... i was diagnosed with bpd back in 2016 but didn’t really think i had it. my ex was diagnosed with it later that year or maybe the following year and i watched her go through hell so i figured “there’s no way i have that, i’m nothing like her”. wellll after we broke up i learned a lot about it and what do you know, i fucking have it. anyway, i’ve always been on an antidepressant and then got put on latuda back in 2018 when i fell into a depression after an old classmate from high school ended his life. i was depressed for probably 6 months and then was stable for about 2.5 years. back in may i started using nicotine and then became addicted for a couple months until i was laying in bed and had this out of body panic attack and i freaked out and blamed it on the nicotine so i quit cold turkey (bad idea). at this time i was drinking and smoking a little weed but not a lot of both. then i just spiraled into this deep dark depression/existential crisis. it’s almost been 3 months and at this rate i feel like it’s getting worse. my psychiatrist put me on lamictal but i know it takes weeks to kick in which sucks. she took me off of latuda and put me on 100mg of seroquel but i feel like it’s making me have crazy anxiety so we’re going back to latuda. seroquel doesn’t even knock me out like wtf. so right now i’m taking 20mg of paxil (that i don’t even think works anymore), 25 of lamictal (until we find a higher dose that works), and 20 of latuda. i have an appointment with a therapist on tuesday who knows dbt and i know i need to start that.

Risperidone (Risperdal) withdrawal. Could use advice.,"well it took long enough but i finally got off my lamictal and am on to quitting risperidone. i waited until it had been like a solid 6 weeks since my last dose of lamictal and most of the withdrawal was over. all this withdrawal has been going on since the start of may so i'm pretty sick of it and am tapering my risperidone quicker so it can all be over sooner than later. this one definitely isn't as bad as the lamictal withdrawal so that's good, but according to articles it can last way longer which is a bummer.

i was at .5mg twice daily and started by skipping my evening dose for 5 full days. yesterday was my first day completely off it, and it started getting pretty rough there in the evening. i have a feeling today will be the worst day. i'm hoping since it's such a low dose it will be somewhat tame. i've also been working on quitting smoking (well using my ecig anyway) and am on step 2 of the patch but had some step 1 patches left over for rough days. so yesterday i wore a step 1 patch, and i'm doing the same thing today. it definitely helps at least a little to have the extra nicotine because i was dissociating slightly prior to putting it on today.

i've only thrown up once so far, but i have a super fickle stomach so that's not really much to make a fuss about. i made some jello and am going to try to stick to tame foods. other symptoms: irritability, some depression, slight confusion type feeling (although the whole summer feels like a blur of withdrawal so far so idk), headaches that can progress into migraines, fatigue, and tons of anxiety. there's probably more, but my brain feels like an angry animated scribble of shouting thoughts.

i've been continuing the supplements that helped a bit during the lamictal withdrawal: daily multivitamin, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and b-complex. also vitamin d since my dad has ms.

so does anyone have any advice on other stuff or activities that might help or have experiences they could share?

i feel like these stupid drugs should have the same kind of warning labels on them as nicotine products. i mean at least you get a nice big warning of how addictive of a substance nicotine is before getting addicted to it so you know what you've gotten yourself into. and it's bullshit that there's countless people out there professionally trained in helping people get off of the illegal drugs or alcohol but you're pretty much on your own struggling to get off the shit doctors prescribed you. i mean my psychiatrist is aware of me quitting these meds obviously. i actually took things much much slower than her orders because of how terrible it was. ugh.

my advice to anyone who has to quit either of these drugs (lamictal and risperidone) someday: do it when you don't have a lot going on in your life and you have the free time to deal with all the emotions and side effects involved. i don't think i could handle this if i was working full time.",1531418213,FALSE,BPD,2018-07-12 17:56:53,"Risperidone (Risperdal) withdrawal.

Lithium and BPD? Anyone?,"so i just got put on lithium, i really kinda pushed for it because of the things people say about it… that it’s numbing, etc… i’m really hoping and praying that it does anything for me.

when i first started lamictal my reaction to it was immediate. the next day i felt nothing and no attachment to anyone, not even fp. we had an argument and it was completely one sided, i was really looking at him like “why are you upset”… i just didn’t feel it… which was like a superpower…
that didn’t last long, it turned into healthy emotional regulation, where i could care and love and also feel happy and also work through things that make me feel upset. i could talk through things instead of fight about them. we had to keep upping the dose because about a month after each increase, i would break down again, then with the increase- right back to reality! by the time we upped the dose to 400mg, the emotional regulation was gone. all that time (25mg increases at a time!) chasing regulation, but i can’t go higher than 400.

i’m still on lamictal because even though i feel unmedicated, i’m sure it’s doing … something probably.  but i just got on lithium too, yesterday.

all this to say, has anyone been on lithium here and have had the experiences that i had? did they last? when did they start? did anyone feel emotionally numbed? anything helpful? decrease in anger, impulsivity, anything??

BPD and ADHD,"so fairly long, sorry...
i've been diagnosed bpd for over two years with anxiety that changes from moderate to severe with occasional panic attacks, treatment-resistant depression, and moderate social phobia. 

my parents don't believe in mental health problems and so as a child they never sought out anything. 

i'm 99% sure i have adhd. i was out of therapy for a while after moving out of state, had a bad time, realized that dbt didn't really exist in texas and only saw a psychiatrist. after doing extensive research and starting meds (my first stint in therapy was several trial/error drug combinations with nothing that worked). i ended up on lamictal 100mgs, .25mgs xanax for when my anxiety built up (i really hate sedatives. i'm groggy forever), and because i exhibited symptoms of adhd and wanted to try a stimulant, i started vyvanse. we started with 20mgs to 40mgs and then moved back to minnesota.  they vyvanse is literally the only thing i've taken that has noticeably increased my quality of life and decreased the majority of my negative symptoms. it took me 3 months to get an intake with another psychiatrist and i'm seeing someone to practice individual dbt skills weekly. i saw him, told him my latest set of meds was extremely helpful and while he represcribed the vyvanse he wanted me to have an official adhd diagnosis before our next meeting. did two meetings with someone who specializes in adhd with both self-surveys, informant surveys, and a computerized attention test. i scored in diagnostic criteria across the board for everything. i really didn't think my attention was that bad, but on the computer test i was slow and apparently my score for visual was 0. i knew i missed a few, but i definitely hadn't missed all, but had trouble concentrating on the screen when i was listening for auditory cues. a normal person would score in the 80s-90s and someone with no struggles would easily get 100. 

this specialist then told me that while it might look like i have adhd, that my anxiety is the main perpetrator in my cognitive lapse. he then said that he recommends i stop vyvanse since it will cause psychosis, to start an ssri (which i've tried more than i can count and never have had any luck), take an anxiety med (which make me groggy for hours on end and incapable of doing work, school, or driving), and to continue dbt skills. 

i'm terrified my psychiatrist is going to agree with him and refuse to continue my vyvanse and insist i try meds i've already tried and have had terrible side effects or outcomes with because of this. 

there are several studies that suggest a strong comorbidity link between adhd and bpd (which i've printed out and remarked upon for reference in my next meeting), that a stimulant can be used extremely successfully, and that a stimulant induced psychosis occurs with people who enter into a psychosis (like schizos/bipolar, which i've never exhibited symptoms of) or those with a family history of such. 

am i just freaking out? do i need to calm down? should i find a new psychiatrist if he refuses? i feel like he thinks i'm trying to abuse it, but i honestly just want a life worth living. have you guys tried a stimulant successfully? i feel like its bullshit that this specialist refused to acknowledge that i could have both. he didn't even bring up my bpd diagnosis, which i don't think he has much experience with and i'm just really at a loss.",1477294281,FALSE,BPD,2016-10-24 07:31:21,"BPD and ADHD so fairly long, sorry...

i'm 99% sure i have adhd. i was out of therapy for a while after moving out of state, had a bad time, realized that dbt didn't really exist in texas and only saw a psychiatrist. after doing extensive research and starting meds (my first stint in therapy was several trial/error drug combinations with nothing that worked). i ended up on lamictal 100mgs, .25mgs xanax for when my anxiety built up (i really hate sedatives. i'm groggy forever), and because i exhibited symptoms of adhd and wanted to try a stimulant, i started vyvanse. we started with 20mgs to 40mgs and then moved back to minnesota.  they vyvanse is literally the only thing i've taken that has noticeably increased my quality of life and decreased the majority of my negative symptoms. it took me 3 months to get an intake with another psychiatrist and i'm seeing someone to practice individual dbt skills weekly. i saw him, told him my latest set of meds was extremely helpful and while he represcribed the vyvanse he wanted me to have an official adhd diagnosis before our next meeting. did two meetings with someone who specializes in adhd with both self-surveys, informant surveys, and a computerized attention test. i scored in diagnostic criteria across the board for everything. i really didn't think my attention was that bad, but on the computer test i was slow and apparently my score for visual was 0. i knew i missed a few, but i definitely hadn't missed all, but had trouble concentrating on the screen when i was listening for auditory cues. a normal person would score in the 80s-90s and someone with no struggles would easily get 100. 

this specialist then told me that while it might look like i have adhd, that my anxiety is the main perpetrator in my cognitive lapse. he then said that he recommends i stop vyvanse since it will cause psychosis, to start an ssri (which i've tried more than i can count and never have had any luck), take an anxiety med (which make me groggy for hours on end and incapable of doing work, school, or driving), and to continue dbt skills. 

i'm terrified my psychiatrist is going to agree with him and refuse to continue my vyvanse and insist i try meds i've already tried and have had terrible side effects or outcomes with because of this. 

there are several studies that suggest a strong comorbidity link between adhd and bpd (which i've printed out and remarked upon for reference in my next meeting), that a stimulant can be used extremely successfully, and that a stimulant induced psychosis occurs with people who enter into a psychosis (like schizos/bipolar, which i've never exhibited symptoms of) or those with a family history of such. 

am i just freaking out? do i need to calm down? should i find a new psychiatrist if he refuses? i feel like he thinks i'm trying to abuse it, but i honestly just want a life worth living. have you guys tried a stimulant successfully? i feel like its bullshit that this specialist refused to acknowledge that i could have both. he didn't even bring up my bpd diagnosis, which i don't think he has much experience with and i'm just really at a loss.",bpd adhd fairly long sorry ive diagnosed bpd two year anxiety change moderate severe occasional panic attack treatmentresistant depression moderate social phobia parent dont believe mental health problem child never sought anything im 99 sure adhd therapy moving state bad time realized dbt didnt really exist texas saw psychiatrist extensive research starting med first stint therapy several trialerror drug combination nothing worked ended lamictal 100mgs 25mgs xanax anxiety built really hate sedative im groggy forever exhibited symptom adhd wanted try stimulant started vyvanse started 20mgs 40mgs moved back minnesota vyvanse literally thing ive taken noticeably increased quality life decreased majority negative symptom took 3 month get intake another psychiatrist im seeing someone practice individual dbt skill weekly saw told latest set med extremely helpful represcribed vyvanse wanted official adhd diagnosis next meeting two meeting someone specializes adhd selfsurveys informant survey computerized attention test scored diagnostic criterion across board everything really didnt think attention bad computer test slow apparently score visual 0 knew missed definitely hadnt missed trouble concentrating screen listening auditory cue normal person would score 80s90s someone struggle would easily get 100 specialist told might look like adhd anxiety main perpetrator cognitive lapse said recommends stop vyvanse since cause psychosis start ssri ive tried count never luck take anxiety med make groggy hour end incapable work school driving continue dbt skill im terrified psychiatrist going agree refuse continue vyvanse insist try med ive already tried terrible side effect outcome several study suggest strong comorbidity link adhd bpd ive printed remarked upon reference next meeting stimulant used extremely successfully stimulant induced psychosis occurs people enter psychosis like schizosbipolar ive never exhibited symptom family history freaking need calm find new psychiatrist refuse feel like think im trying abuse honestly want life worth living guy tried stimulant successfully feel like bullshit specialist refused acknowledge could didnt even bring bpd diagnosis dont think much experience im really loss,0.999310163743244,"['Alprazolam', 'Lamotrigine', 'Lisdexamfetamine']","```json

This illness is ruining and has ruined my life. tw suicide mention; tw self-harm mention,"i can’t take it anymore. bpd has affected all my relationships, romantic and non-romantic, i’ve constantly pushed people away, people have distanced themselves from me because i’m unbearable, and i’m recently going through a breakup which is making this all worse, when he said he could put up with it, it wasn’t a problem, and in the end he lied and ended abandoning me, like i knew he would. 

i’ve lost so many friends over the years. i’m 26. i experienced a traumatic event at around age 9 which probably caused my bpd and everything else. ever since then, it’s been being locked up in my room, developed chronic depression, generalized anxiety disorder, bpd, and bipolar 1. and it’s been this way for around 15 years. in a room. on my computer. mentally ill. not doing anything with my life. while losing irl friends, online friends, ldr relationships, etc, because i’m too difficult to deal with.

this illness is the worst thing ever. there is no cure for it. no medication. only therapy. i haven’t found dbt therapy yet, nowhere, only cbt therapy, which i know helps a bit, but still. 
my psych used to see me 2 times a week for 2 hours. now she’s busy with stuff and can only do 1 time a week for 1 hour to 1:30. that’s not enough therapy. 

no antidepressant has worked on me. i’ve taken all of them. so i went back to my roots and i’m on fluoxetine (prozac) 40mg. it doesn’t do anything. i’m also in buproprion (wellbutrin). 100mg. topamax 100mg. klonopin 2mg - 4 - 6 varying throughout the day depending on my anxiety, taken as needed. lamotrigine (lamictal) 150  and thinking of increasing it to 200. and i recently starting taking vyvanse to help with my binge eating disorder and it’s helped me lose a ton of weight.
what are you guys taking?

i had hope that my last relationship would actually work out, because we had plans on moving in together, marrying, etc, but that failed and he turned out to be an ass and this is probably why i’m more unstable than usual. yeah i’m one of those “hopeless romantic” types of people. 

i’ve lost hope. this illness and the rest of my illnesses will be with me forever. unless i kill myself before then. which i’ve been considering a lot lately, especially because of breakup. i can’t do that though because i don’t want to do that with my family. most importantly my grandma and mom. we’re extremely close. if they weren’t alive i’d kill myself immediately.

i self harmed because of my ex. i never self harm. only in extreme cases like when my cat died. but the pain i was feeling from my ex was so strong i had to mask it with another pain and it felt good. 

i don’t know what to do anymore. i’m 26 and have done nothing with my life because of these illnesses. i want to give up (not as in kill myself) but just do nothing from now on. i wish i could not feel anything. i wish i didn’t have to be in a romantic relationship to be happy. i wish for so many things. i have so many ambitions and life goals but i don’t think i’ll be able to fulfill them.

(switching from effexor, lexapro and lamotrigine to wellbutrin and lamotrigine) my doctor had me taper way too quickly as i am realizing now from reading people's accounts online of how they had to spend 9 months tapering off of lexapro on it's own - not even counting the effexor withdrawal which is a living nightmare. 

i have brain zaps, near constant panic, fatigue, dizziness, among other things. plus the regular migraines i always get. good times.

additionally, i am unstable enough right now with the neurochemical soup in my brain that i am being triggered so quickly and severely, i don't even feel like i have a chance to stop it. my husband and i have been fighting almost nonstop with a few days here and there of reprieve. 

with *my shit*, i need to feel safe and loved, no matter what. but when i feel unloved/abandoned emotionally or physically (particularly by my husband) i go off the rails. his defense mechanisms are withdrawal, avoidance and emotional shutdown. so i feel like i'm constantly in a tailspin of rarely feeling loved in a way that makes me feel safe and accepted.

i've been feeling like i don't want to live more intensely than i have in a very long time, but it stops at suicidal ideation. i have always said in my right mind that i would never ruin my children's lives by killing myself. and i feel like that is taken for granted by my so so that when i say i don't want to live, it's not taken seriously unless i want to leave the house.

Anyone know a med similar to quetiapine but without the weight gain?,"hi! some background info i’m currently on sertraline and i am also prescribed quetiapine (a relatively small dose of 25mg in the morning and 50mg at night) however i stopped taking my quetiapine a few months ago after it made me gain around 30 pounds in 5/6 months. as someone with problems with ed’s and serious body image problems i could not cope with that amount of weight gained and in fear of gaining more i stopped taking them.

apart from the weight gain, it was a great med for me and seemed to be working well despite the small dose. i did also use to take an extra 25mg as prn when having a bpd episode which calmed me down. it was a life saver really in that aspect but unfortunately the weight gain over-rid the good. been off it for about two months now so have got through the awful withdrawal stage.

so now i am just on sertraline and my mood swings and episodes are becoming very frequent again. i’m an emotional wreck and i can’t get anything done. i have no motivation and basically just spend my days in bed falling behind on all my uni work. i hate this.

i have a medication review coming up next week where i’m going to tell them i’ve come of quetiapine but i really feel like i need to be put on an alternative because as i am right now i don’t think an anti depressant is enough and i feel like i definitely need an anti psychotic or mood stabiliser to go along side it. does anyone know of a med similar to quetiapine just without the weight gain? i’m sure my psychiatrist will have some options but would just like to get a perspective and advice from people with bpd who have experienced the med themselves.

Advice on Sleep Regulation,"so i figure this is probably the best place to ask for bpd-related advice but i guess i don't really know. some lengthy backstory on my circumstances:

&gt;!i'm a career insomniac (since i was a toddler basically) and have always had difficulty waking in the morning as well, regardless of when i do successfully fall asleep. this has always had a negative impact on my performance in basically everything. i used to be able to pull all-nighters in order to be on time for important things scheduled in the morning (i did this frequently throughout college), but this is less and less the case and i know it's bad for me anyway.

as i entered my 20s, high stress, drug use, and (i'm assuming most of all) genetic factors contributed to a decline in my mental health. my emotions started to become erratic and my sleep schedule worsened. things came to a head when, during a period of high stress about two years ago, i began to hear voices. they were mostly benign, but it scared me to death and i went to my doctor. he diagnosed it as depression with psychotic features and prescribed me clonazepam and aripiprazole. i started at 5mg of the abilify, but experienced highly unpleasant akathisia and dropped the dose to 2.5mg, in combination with 100mg quetiapine. the quetiapine made me feel like shit so we got rid of that altogether and my symptoms seemed managed on the 2.5mg abilify. the klonopin worked fine and helped with my anxiety.

to the point, i am now 22. a few months ago, towards the beginning of the covid outbreak in the us (another period of high stress during which i was sent home from school and my job prospects fell apart), i began to experience new symptoms. i would go days with little sleep, feeling incredible, productive, sociable, and driven. i would spend money recklessly. then i would become incredibly depressed and/or listless and aimless and sleep for most of the day for lack of motivation to do anything else. there were points at which i was essentially catatonic. i don't know why i ignored these warning signs, but i carried on like this for a few weeks until things came to a head when my longtime girlfriend broke up with me. one morning the voices came back, but i tried to just shut them out. i couldn't be bothered to seek help anymore at that point i guess. it was only when the hallucinations became more vivid, to the point that i could no longer distinguish them from reality, that i worried. then i started to see things. vivid visual hallucinations. i still refused to seek help. only once my mother found me asleep on the living room floor in a particularly bad depressive episode, was i forced to seek help.

ultimately, the hallucinations subsided of their own accord as i got my stress levels under control. the periodic mood swings did not and it was ruining my life. at this point i had done my research and was fully aware that i was suffering from bipolar disorder. i was fortunate enough to have a family friend familiar with a nearby psychiatrist specializing in psychotic disorders. i was referred and got an appointment quickly (i consider this an act of some higher power). as i had suspected, he diagnosed me with schizoaffective bpd 2. he suggested some medications including lithium and lamotrigine.!&lt; 

the more pertinent bit:

i did my research and decided on the lamotrigine and began dose titration shortly thereafter. i recently got up to the goal dosage of 100mg and my symptoms have largely dissipated. however, i still experience periods of sleeplessness maybe every two days. it severely impacts every facet of my life and i feel like it is causing my mental state to take another turn for the worse. furthermore, i am trying to secure a job. i know that i will not be able to hold the job if i cannot regulate my erratic sleep schedule. i can tell my parents worry but don't know what to do.

i have, over the years, tried everything under the sun (prescription and otherwise) to help with my sleep and have only found two things that will both allow me to fall asleep in a timely manner and force me to wake up at a reasonable hour: alcohol, which i know will ultimately cause much more harm than good if i attempt long-term self-medication with it; and ghb, which seems more practicable. ghb, however, is illicit and fairly expensive at the dosage i would require to medicate. i am aware, however, that ghb is occasionally prescribed for narcolepsy at a fairly low dose. i am considering asking my gp (who is aware of my situation) if he will prescribe me a buttload of narcolepsy meds. i think he may be open to it, as he knows i have tried almost every alternative.

however, being realistic, this is a longshot. i was wondering if anyone here has any non-medication strategies they use to regulate bpd-related disordered sleep. i am fairly desperate at this point, so any advice is much appreciated.",1602751891,FALSE,BPD,2020-10-15 08:51:31,"Advice on Sleep Regulation so i figure this is probably the best place to ask for bpd-related advice but i guess i don't really know. some lengthy backstory on my circumstances:

Stop me from making bad decisions,"this is mostly me needing to vent and get this off my chest. maybe if i put it out to others, i'll realize how silly i sound.

recently it came up how i'm on so many psych meds and it made me really self conscious. now i can't stop thinking about coming off at least a couple of my medications. currently i take 20mg of cipralex, 300mg of wellbutrin, 200mg of lamotrigine and 0.25mg on respiradone.

Brain Fog at 75mg Lamictal,"i’m looking for advice on where to go from here, with lamictal being helpful but also giving me irritating brain fog. 

i’ve been on lamictal since february. until may it was 25mg a day because i switched doctors in that time. in may i went up to 50 mg, then in june i went up to 75 mg which i have been at for 6 weeks or so. i was prescribed it for bipolar ii and for bpd. 

about two weeks ago i noticed more brain fog than normal. every time i went up in dose before i had brain fog for maybe a week, then it went away. 

this time it hasn’t gone away and persists. sometimes drinking caffeine gets rid of that, but most of the time caffeine only helps slightly and prior to the 75mg lamictal i almost never drank caffeine. 

it’s really annoying because i also have adhd so it basically feels like it’s made all those symptoms worse. it often takes so much effort to think about anything. i feel like i can’t focus on even thinking. reading is even harder than because i can’t focus on the words and sometimes it takes a few seconds to grasp the words. i’m still able to think intelligently, come up with good ideas, etc and i’m not confused, it’s just my brain feels slow and foggy. sometimes i have trouble remembering things or remembering words which never happened before any more than the average person. all of that is really frustrating because i’m a very active and productive person, and all of that has been harder lately. i also feel tired or unmotivated often and it makes me so frustrated sometimes that i start crying. 

it’s also frustrating because the lamictal is really helping. my phq-9 score went from 24 down to 12 since at 75mg. my anxiety has been a lot better. my bipolar seems calm as far as i can tell, and my bpd is so so much better. i’m actually able to be relatively calm about my fp and my suicidal feelings have mostly gone away which is really nice. 

i don’t know what i want my doctor to do though. the brain fog is so annoying but i’m afraid of trying another mood stabilizer because this one helps so well with minimal side effects and i tend to have bad side effects on meds (i’ve  taken zoloft, celexa, and hydroxyzine, and all of them had such horrible side effects and made me feel so much worse so i had to stop all of them) so i’m terrified of trying new meds and because i respond so poorly to most of them.

Lamictal (Lamotrigine) - how will I notice a difference?,"i started using lamictal (lamotrigine) 7 weeks ago, sloowly titerating upward with only 5 mg increase every week for the first 10 weeks as i had a small rash starting with the normal dose titerating schedule of 25 mg every two weeks. so far so good - no rash yet and i'm on 35 mg now. when i reach 50 mg, i will increase with 10 mg every week until i reach 200 mg. this means i will have reached my dose goal january 12th 2018.

my questions are:

1) how will i notice a difference in my mood, depressive state, anxiety, impulsivity, anger, feelings of emptiness, interpersonal insecurity, total boredom, dissociation and identity disturbances, difficulty motivating my self to do anything and so forth?

2) have you experienced any side effects, except rash/breaking out?

can anyone please tell me how they noticed a difference in their total state of being on this med? it would be very much appreciated. i am suffering pretty hard as of now.

some background - i have always had a problem controlling my impulses. looking back, all my bpd symptoms started to emerge when i started high school. anyway, in college i started to drink way more, to dull my low low lows, and before going into social situations to lower my inhibitions (i'm rather nervous socially, but i don't think i come off as awkward.) i started taking adderall to stay up all night to study, which led to taking it before hitting the gym so i could work out harder, which led to using it at parties while i was drinking. i never planned on drinking or using adderall. the thought would come to me and i would immediately go get my fake id and run to the liquor store, or call my friend who sold addy.

and since the stigma is so real against bpd, i'm afraid to tell people at meetings. but i did tell a small group of people who i felt were rather trustworthy about how my bpd leads me to problems with impulse control and that's what makes my recovery different from theirs, and they basically said i'm using my diagnosis as an excuse. excuse from what? i dunno. they didn't specify.

i am an addict. i went into withdrawals when i stopped using. but my addiction has always, always, always been a symptom of my bpd. i know that.

Living with untreated BPD,"this is my first time posting to reddit. i usually just enjoy wandering around different subreddits and browsing, but i like coming here when i feel down and out, and it's gotten to the point where i feel like i should post something.

i've been around medication and therapists since my freshman year in high school. for the majority of this time i was always diagnosed with depression, and this was around the time my grandfather died so i could see this as being a fitting description of my personality. back then i knew nothing of bpd. in high school i was given lexapro to help cope with my depression, but it made everything a lot worse, and i was constantly depressed and suicidal. after the pills started kicking in during the summer, i spent almost a whole month locked up in my room avoiding any sort of social contact and cutting myself on a daily basis. it was really bad. 

once i got off of the medication things started to look up for me. i met someone and got into a relationship that was calm and comfortable for a while. it was my first good relationship in a long time, at least in the beginning. i have a lot of really trademark symptoms of bpd especially when it comes to relationships. i am attached and idealize the person i'm with a lot, but i've always been extremely loyal and i had never started to make messes in my relationships until i saw that the connection was fading. i'm very much the kind of person who can't let go of something that is dying and just accept its end. i have to hold on for all i can.

after a year of dating, this boy and i were very happy with each other, but he was graduating high school early and planning on going out of the country for a year. he never broke up with me before his departure, he merely got progressively distant as the day he was supposed to leave neared. we spent the last day together and had a teary goodbye, but, like i said, he never told me that our relationship was over, and i'm not even sure he considered it to be over until he was out of the country for a while. he even sent me a letter in his first month signed, ""love, g--"". so, naturally, i thought we were still together, until i got a prompt email in february that explained his desire to move on, and that that was his intent all along. i was devastated, but there was nothing i could really do with him so far away and so far from email or a phone. i learned to just go on without him for the next five months, until he came to my house the day after he came home. i would like to say that i was mostly fine until i saw him. when he came to my house to say hello after a year of being gone, i just wanted him back and i couldn't understand his petty, ambiguous reasons for leaving. the next year really exposed my bpd tendencies. i feel like i went crazy. i tried everything under the sun to get him back, and i even let him take advantage of me because i was convinced sex was love. i yelled at him and called him crying trying to understand where everything went wrong, and i blamed myself constantly and manipulated him into feeling bad. i used self harm and suicide to try to get him to care about me again, and eventually i had to leave my first year of college away from home and enroll in my hometown school while i recovered at my parents' house.

things started looking up as the new semester started. i started dating other people and i had a really good circle of friends who were there for me through everything. i was doing well in school so things were starting to look up significantly. i had started a combination of prozac and abilify to treat my deep depression, and i was given these pills the spring before i came home, and they seemed to be working very well for me.

fast forward to this year. it has been almost two years since being given the combination of prozac and abilify. i am currently in my spring semester of my third year in college, and last semester i had a lot of difficulty dealing with my emotions and moods. i barely went to class or work, and i was struggling through every aspect of my life. i was pulling an all-nighter every week in a desperate attempt to get all of my work done because i was flooded with lack of motivation and an inability to concentrate. i was taking the same doses as before, so i didn't understand where this was all coming from. i was so inundated by my responsibilities that i was feeling extreme forms of stress, and in a random spell of trichtillomania, i pulled out all of my eyelashes within the course of two weeks. i was seeing a psychiatrist at the time and she was putting me on lamictal while trying to take me off the prozac and abilify. i felt like i was going to burst, so in my flighty state i stopped going to my psychiatrist and stopped taking medication altogether.

i felt extremely tired and low within the month and a half that followed, and i know this probably has to do with cutting myself off from the medicine so suddenly, but, at the time, i felt like there was no other way. i was happy with the result of everything after getting off my medication, and i felt more lively and more like myself.

spring semester has started and i feel like i am overwhelmed by all the stress in my life. i feel like i never have enough money for anything. my relationships with my friends are deteriorating as time goes on. i very much feel more angry and irritable on a daily basis, and i am so stuck within my negative thoughts that i constantly feel like i am going to cry. i am in an amazing relationship with someone i love, but i'm always scared i'm doing something wrong, or that i'm going to be to blame if everything falls apart. i feel like i lash out at my parents for just being concerned with how i am doing. i don't like talking about anything. i go to a therapist once a week, but most times i end up skipping class afterwards because i get so ashamed of myself and depressed. most of all, i am unsure of who i am, and i greatly dislike whoever i am. i cannot escape from the eyes of others, and i am constantly worried about what people think of me. i don't ever feel relaxed. i feel constantly sad and horrified about everything in life.

even before, without medication, i feel like things have not been this bad, in terms of the way i perceive myself. i thankfully do not think of suicide anymore, but i am constantly trying to escape in some way, and i often fantasize about running away and forgetting everything. i don't want to go back on medication because the process is so slow and arduous and i don't want to be disappointed with another medication that stops working. i just don't know what to do anymore to make myself feel better. i never want to do anything. all i ever want to do is sleep in order to avoid all of my problems.

i don't know what advice i'm really asking for, i just wonder if anyone knows this awful feeling, and if anyone knows the best way to evaluate life and this disorder without being completely overwhelmed.",1424656351,FALSE,BPD,2015-02-23 01:52:31,"Living with untreated BPD this is my first time posting to reddit. i usually just enjoy wandering around different subreddits and browsing, but i like coming here when i feel down and out, and it's gotten to the point where i feel like i should post something.

even before, without medication, i feel like things have not been this bad, in terms of the way i perceive myself. i thankfully do not think of suicide anymore, but i am constantly trying to escape in some way, and i often fantasize about running away and forgetting everything. i don't want to go back on medication because the process is so slow and arduous and i don't want to be disappointed with another medication that stops working. i just don't know what to do anymore to make myself feel better. i never want to do anything. all i ever want to do is sleep in order to avoid all of my problems.

i don't know what advice i'm really asking for, i just wonder if anyone knows this awful feeling, and if anyone knows the best way to evaluate life and this disorder without being completely overwhelmed.",living untreated bpd first time posting reddit usually enjoy wandering around different subreddits browsing like coming feel gotten point feel like post something ive around medication therapist since freshman year high school majority time always diagnosed depression around time grandfather died could see fitting description personality back knew nothing bpd high school given lexapro help cope depression made everything lot worse constantly depressed suicidal pill started kicking summer spent almost whole month locked room avoiding sort social contact cutting daily basis really bad got medication thing started look met someone got relationship calm comfortable first good relationship long time least beginning lot really trademark symptom bpd especially come relationship attached idealize person im lot ive always extremely loyal never started make mess relationship saw connection fading im much kind person cant let go something dying accept end hold year dating boy happy graduating high school early planning going country year never broke departure merely got progressively distant day supposed leave neared spent last day together teary goodbye like said never told relationship im even sure considered country even sent letter first month signed love g naturally thought still together got prompt email february explained desire move intent along devastated nothing could really far away far email phone learned go without next five month came house day came home would like say mostly fine saw came house say hello year gone wanted back couldnt understand petty ambiguous reason leaving next year really exposed bpd tendency feel like went crazy tried everything sun get back even let take advantage convinced sex love yelled called cry trying understand everything went wrong blamed constantly manipulated feeling bad used self harm suicide try get care eventually leave first year college away home enroll hometown school recovered parent house thing started looking new semester started started dating people really good circle friend everything well school thing starting look significantly started combination prozac abilify treat deep depression given pill spring came home seemed working well fast forward year almost two year since given combination prozac abilify currently spring semester third year college last semester lot difficulty dealing emotion mood barely went class work struggling every aspect life pulling allnighter every week desperate attempt get work done flooded lack motivation inability concentrate taking dos didnt understand coming inundated responsibility feeling extreme form stress random spell trichtillomania pulled eyelash within course two week seeing psychiatrist time putting lamictal trying take prozac abilify felt like going burst flighty state stopped going psychiatrist stopped taking medication altogether felt extremely tired low within month half followed know probably cutting medicine suddenly time felt like way happy result everything getting medication felt lively like spring semester started feel like overwhelmed stress life feel like never enough money anything relationship friend deteriorating time go much feel angry irritable daily basis stuck within negative thought constantly feel like going cry amazing relationship someone love im always scared im something wrong im going blame everything fall apart feel like lash parent concerned dont like talking anything go therapist week time end skipping class afterwards get ashamed depressed unsure greatly dislike whoever cannot escape eye others constantly worried people think dont ever feel relaxed feel constantly sad horrified everything life even without medication feel like thing bad term way perceive thankfully think suicide anymore constantly trying escape way often fantasize running away forgetting everything dont want go back medication process slow arduous dont want disappointed another medication stop working dont know anymore make feel better never want anything ever want sleep order avoid problem dont know advice im really asking wonder anyone know awful feeling anyone know best way evaluate life disorder without completely overwhelmed,0.9971669891897360,"['Aripiprazole', 'Escitalopram', 'Fluoxetine', 'Lamotrigine']","```json

Treatment has improved my life so much!! (A feel good story),"being diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder, borderline personality disorder, ocd, anxiety and, adhd, and from about 17 to my current age of 25 i was off my meds for.. stupid reasons.

after a major mental break down a few months back, a good friend of mine persuaded me to get mental health treatment again. 

i started seeing a therapist as well as a psychiatrist about 2 months ago and i have been on a medication regiment ever since, more specifically lamotrigine (lamictal), olanzapine (zyprexa), guanfacine (tenex, intuniv) and lorazepam (ativan). 

with the exception of the guanfacine, this medication regiment has been working wonders for me!! for the first time in 10 years i finally feel stable and happy. i have had so many fewer mood swings. i have more motivation to do things, i have such a positive outlook on life now, even when i experienced a minor depressive episode a few days back, i felt down, but it wasn't like the deathly gloom that normally washes over me. and no brain fog!!

i don't even have a desire to listen to the negative music that i always listen to most of the time. 

i just feel so much more energetic but not like hypomanic energetic, just.. normal energetic everyday. 

the zyprexa is helping me get more restful sleep because i'm not compulsively writing in my journal, or dealing with intrusive thoughts.

the ativan has been a godsend for my anxiety, when i have panic attacks. 

but i think my favorite medication is the lamictal. i just feel so much happier and more stable because of it.

and my therapist is wonderful she's so kind and caring and she's so good at listening she actually remembers what i'm saying, both long term and short term. 
she remembers things i told her from weeks prior!! 

and one time i was a bit manic when i seen her and i rapidly expressed three different major problems and elaborated quite a bit on them back to back without taking a break and then when i was finished she recited back to me an overview of what i told her to make sure she had a good understanding. 

i was really impressed that she was actually able to absorb and retain all of that.

Medication reviews for BPD?,"so i'm debating asking my dr about trying different meds for my bpd because therapy isn't really enough. i hate trying out new meds because of the possible side effects and feeling like shit while your brain adjusts to it etc. i also have anxiety and depression so i used to take lexapro (escitalopram) and wellbutrin xl but the lexapro made my ibs worse so i came off of it and am only on wellbutrin.

Question Regarding Lamotrigine and Increased Anxiety,"i'm going to start this with my actual question and then provide some context.

has anyone gone through an increase in anxiety starting lamotrigine, and if so what if anything were you able to do about it?

\*context\*

back in march i was sent to an adult adhd specialist, for years i was bouncing between adhd meds and was looking to finally lock something down. along with this i've suffered from depression the last year and a half from an awful breakup, i've been doing therapy (mostly for trust issues) and while it's been a long road i can say i am getting better.

when i went for my appointment i got a bit of a slap in the face after filling out some questionnaires and doing a few reaction tests i was put in an office where i had a ""skype"" appointment with the doctor. this was just as covid was ramping up.

this entire conversation lasted a total of 10-15 minutes and consisted of this doctor i had never met before telling me along with adhd i had bpd. at the time i had no idea what bpd and in this 10 minute appointment not much was explained to me.. the doctor sent me out the door with a prescription for adderall (10mg now 20mg) and lamotrigine(gradual increase to 100mg) i'm waiting for my therapists office to reopen from covid to get a second opinion.

being completely honest i've been keeping all this in my back pocket until i get that second opinion, my therapist knows about this new diagnosis and has me top of the list for a second assessment once they reopen but for the most part we have agreed to focus on my initial depression and trust issue during our phone call appointments. the reason i'm more laid back on it is my therapist who has known me 2+ years didn't exactly sound too confident of that diagnosis by the doctor who met me for 15 minutes tops.

about 2.5 months ago i started noticing i was clenching my jaw, biting my tongue and lip. this was to the point id be leaving teeth marks on my tongue or getting aggressive pain in my back teeth before i even caught on i was doing it. the first thing i did was call my family doctor and ask to be switched off adderall, i knew anxiety was a side effect, it was a brand new medication so felt like the right place to start. a month went by and it got worse..

next i thought maybe the thoughts of bpd hanging over my head were causing me increased anxiety so i booked an appointment with my therapist specially to talk about that. the truth with that is i'm at peace with the idea i may have bpd. if it turned out to be true it would finally give a name to what i've been going through and give me something to attack for lack of a better word. to this point covid also hasn't increased my anxiety, i took up a new hobby of collecting basketball cards and have actually turned quite a nice profit while building up a personal collection of my favorite players

next my family doctor started me on buspirone (10mg 3x day) along with 1-2 50mg trazodone before bed to help me sleep. today marks 6 weeks on buspirone and while i've gotten better at noticing when i'm locking up my jaw it's still consistent, i just use the heads up to start chewing on a piece of gum until i go do something to distract myself (gym, walk, basketball etc)

i know this was a long walk for a short drink of water but wanted to provide context for this question. i am running out of options of things in the last few months that have caused this sudden increase in anxiety.

my next thought after exhausting every option listed above is call my family doctor and begin scaling back my lamotrigine until i get in for the second assessment because when things began to peak (2.5 months ago) was right around when i hit my current dose of 100mg, but before doing that i wanted to stop by here and get some feedback.

"DAE feel “toned-down”, numb or apathetic on lamictal?","i was on lamictal for around 3 years straight, along with lexapro and inderal as well. i started pristiq as my psych thought the lexapro was starting to lose effectiveness. i have been just taking the pristiq for around 3 months now. 

i am definitely feeling more extreme negative emotions in regards to depression and anxiety, but along with that i am also finally experiencing excitement and happiness. i feel like the lamictal toned me down to a point where i was apathetic about everything. yes, i wasn’t having as many panic attacks and my depression was a little less intense, but nothing truly excited me. i didn’t feel that glow in my body that i do now when i’m happy.

How Do I Ask My Doctor to Diagnose Me with BPD/Tell Them I Truly Believe I Have it?,"hi there, lovely beings. i know you might see these posts often, but i don't want you to write me off too fast.

i'm a female, 22, currently diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ptsd (complex). i take 75mg of topamax, 300mg of trileptal for mood stability, and while the meds are okay, i don't think i'm reaching my best potential with them. i also don't think my diagnosis is right.

for quite some time, i've believed i have borderline personality disorder. my mom had it **bad**. i mean, bad bad. she had a litany of other mental illnesses, but the bpd was the driving force behind it all. i remember this because she talked about it a lot and was very abusive towards me growing up. she ended up committing suicide in may of 2017; this is something that haunts me deeply still today.

i have a lot of her same qualities, and more are starting to come out of the woodworks. out of the 9 criteria of bpd, i meet 6 to possibly 7. self-harm and ""splitting"" are probably the biggest ones, as well as a distorted self-image and extreme mood swings (hence why my doctor put me on trileptal) that are fast and don't last long, maybe a day at most. i get road rage, horrendous anxiety that my family will die, etc etc. *i could go on...*

 i've told my psychiatrist about all of this, yet i don't think i've been diagnosed with anything other than what's stated above. i know bpd is a heavy diagnosis, but i feel trapped and honestly, like i'm going crazy. i meet with my psych this thursday and want to bring it up, but self-diagnosing is **never** a good look. like, ever.

\[med talk\]  i don't like my meds, excluding the topamax. the trileptal has made me gain 10-15 pounds of weight, which plays on my distorted body image and possible eating issues, so it's gotta go. i was on lamictal xr, but that was the absolute worst. i'm missing my prozac days lol. i also believe i need an anti-anxiety medication for when i have my intense anxiety episodes; it wouldn't be for everyday use, just for episodes. they've given me clonidine, but that shit just makes me groggy and doesn't do anything. i know docs are afraid to give out scripts for xanax because it's so often abused, but i need something to calm me down when i feel like i need to cut. i've mentioned klonipin to this same psychiatrist and she immediately shut that down. 

feeling very stuck. feeling very hopeless. feeling like i'm crazy.

i’m wondering if anyone has any sort of positive experience with any of that sort of med that didn’t result in a mass gaining of weight?

A rant/experience,"it's been 2 years since i've taken it but i'm scared of being prescribed lamtrogine/lamictal again because of how awful i felt. 

i'm not trying to self diagnose but there aren't many good doctors in my country and they simply jump to the most common disorders. 

i've visted 3 doctors and each diagnosed and prescribed different things and i haven't gone since 2 years ago and i'm ready to go again because i've been in limbo.

anyway, i'm wondering if anyone could guess which disorder is most likely correct from my symptoms and experience from past meds.

i'm feeling completely unsatisfied with my life but with no intention of doing anything that might harm me but i'm just stuck not doing anything. just feeling apathy or depression and rarely do i get sudden bursts or energy but i mostly use them for cleaning the house. usually i'm hyperfixating on really useless things, like binging tv shows i don't even enjoy. so does this sound like borderline personality disorder? i just never felt that to be true for me.

3rd doctor prescription/ didn't even tell me a diagnosis: zoloft which was horrible, peak apathy and indifference. truly felt like a zombie, the opposite of lamictal.

Starting IV Ketamine on the 18th!!!,"i'm so ready for this. i was recently put on lamotrigine (lamictal) and it has wrecked me. that horrible drug experience plus the complete incompetence of my psychiatry clinic in providing basic services and information were the last straws for me to pursue iv ketamine. lamictal is in the top 2 or 3 worst medications i've ever taken, and now the withdrawals from it are hurting me so much. i have never been so depressed or empty (except maybe in my early teenage years). i dissociate and sit on the floor for hours and can't snap out of it. the derealization warps rooms, and i feel like i'm in a doll house and i'm too large for the space. i cry randomly or i can't cry at all. i think about dying a lot but it's much more intense and real. i skip class unintentionally, forget appointments, can't keep track of time, and lose track of where i am traveling to/from. i frequently need help with basic tasks like turning on the bathwater. i feel like i'm in hell and i'm so ready to feel better.

My psychiatrist sucks (CW: SUICIDE),"hey guys, my name is xan, and i'm 15.

a little backstory, in 2019 i was diagnosed (by,, let's call him dr a) with an unspecified personality disorder with borderline traits and a few other things i'd rather not say. i've been seeing a different psychiatrist (dr b) since 2020, and have been on meds since 2019. the current two i'm on (lamotrigine and abilify) are the ones i've been on since 2020. i'm also seeing my family dr (dr c)

dispite technically not being fully diagnosed with bpd, i'm still reciving dbt and talk therapy from my therapist (t)

now, basically, my current psychiatrist (dr b) is kinda unprofessional. one thing he did was tell me ""well what's the point of being on meds if they won't work?"" after i asked him if he was going to put me on different meds, as the 3rd one i was on was reacting badly, and the other two i was on weren't enough on their own. he knew this, but didn't place me on any different medications to help. so i spent seven months waiting for him to call me, and when he finally did, he finally put me on a new medication, effexor xr, which i'm now coming off of as it's made me suicidal

dr b has tried two different medications for me so far, and is now telling me he doesn't know what to do. he kept trying antidepressants, though, in my report from dr a who had diagnosed me, said basically that antidepressants will not work for me if i truly have a personality disorder.

antidepressants have never worked for me in the slightest. dr b has this report, as well as dr c and myself. at my last appointment, i asked dr b about this, and why we kept trying antidepressants if we've been told they wouldn't work for me, and if there was anything else we could try. and then he said that he couldn't diagnose me with a pd and went off topic talking about that. so i didn't get a definite answer, and he just took me off the meds. i then asked him about benzodiaphines. now, i know, they're addictive, however, dr c said in may of 2020, that benzodiaphines could possibly be a last resort for me, and that we would just have to keep a very close eye on thsm. so i asked dr b what he thought. i got lectured about how i'd get addicted and how he wasn't prescribing me any..and that's where things ended off. 

i'm so done with dr b. i see dr c very soon so i'm gonna talk to her about this.

i'm stuck. i'm suffering with suicidal ideation/thoughts (dr b knows this btw and still said there was nothing he could do,) and i don't know what to do. it seems like nobody is listening to me, it seems like nobody cares. i'm done

i'm sorry if this seems confusing. i'm generally so upset and i'm trying to get everything out.

"New to diagnosis, need some medication advice (heads up kind of long)","so ive been in and out of therapy for the last two years and was originally diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder with occasional depressive episodes. because of this i was on and off lexapro 10mg for a while before ultimately deciding to stop it cause i didn’t want to be on medication. however, things started to go downhill for me earlier this fall, and i found myself back in therapy. because things had gotten super bad,  i opened up about my feelings to this new therapist a lot more than i ever had, and she mentioned that the things i was talking about sounded a lot like bpd. long story short, i now have a bpd diagnosis along with my gad. i met with my old psychiatrist who gave me a couple options for meds to try, one of which being lexapro 10mg again. the other two were lamotrigine and abilify. i went back on the lexapro 10mg to try and stabilize my anxiety which was my worst symptom; it worked for about a month but now starting to slip backwards again, especially with the rage and the mood swings, so thinking of trying a new course of meds. abilify is sadly out of the question due to its huge price; i am considering lamotrigine but i’m worried about the side effects plus i am on a combined birth control pill and i heard they interact.

Struggling to understand diagnosis,"long story short -- i have a mother who was physically/emotionally abusive and a father who was physically abusive.  i've dealt with lifelong depression/anxiety/ptsd, and have been to multiple therapists/psychiatrists, as well as tried just about every ssri medication out there and a few less typical medications (lamictal, buspar, mirtazapine, remeron, antipsychotics, probably some i'm forgetting).  i've been on some of the medications more than once and some in combination with others, with no results and a lot of side effects.

my psychiatrist recommended i go on more antipsychotics, which i refused to do (had trouble driving on them and other side effects).  he then recommended i try going on a ssri i've been on two times before, and i said i didn't want to try that again either, and then asked him about different medications.  he told me that i am ""defiant"" and ""not interested in becoming well, either subconsciously or otherwise"".  he then suggested that i have borderline personality disorder.  some of the symptoms seem to fit me (disturbed sense of identity/depression + anxiety/low self esteem), but most do not (emotion regulation issues/unsteady relationships/impulse control/fear of abandonment/difficulty managing anger).  he told me that my being on so many medications and not becoming better was a hallmark of borderline personality disorder, and is why he suspected me of having it.

in previous sessions, my psychiatrist asked me multiple times whether or not i had been arrested/in trouble with the law/involved in physical altercations (no), and repeatedly asked me about my experiences with anger and whether or not i express it inappropriately (no, i am generally calm and collected and have only blown up on somebody twice in the last ~ten years).  after his bpd suggestion and telling me that i am defiant/not interested in becoming well, i asked him for information on other psychiatrists because i felt we were having major issues communicating and that i was justified in not wanting to go on more antipsychotics out of fear of their side effects.

i would really appreciate help with these questions:

1) is it normal to be considered defiant by rejecting (strong) medications that your psychiatrist thinks are best for you but that you cannot handle the side effects of?

2) if somebody thinks you have problems with anger (expressing it) but you remain calm and collected in your daily life and in interactions with the person, how do you convince them that you don't have anger issues?

3) am i justified in wanting to change psychiatrists?  (if it wasn't for the months long wait to see a different psychiatrist, i may have already changed)

4) have you ever been told that you have borderline personality disorder but didn't agree with the diagnosis at first?  if you decided that you agreed with it later, what caused you to change your mind?

5) is not responding to medications really a symptom of borderline personality disorder?

6) does it sound reasonable for me to question the diagnosis?  i'm guessing this is something i can't ""argue my way out of"", but i am interested in getting well and don't want to spend my time pursuing a track that isn't accurate.

i am just exhausted by the mental health system at this point in time, and have been in treatment for over ten years now without much success.  i apologize in advance if this is too close to ""asking for a diagnosis"" as listed in the sidebar, but i am posting this as i have already received one and am struggling to understand why.  if this is inappropriate, please remove it/inform me as to what should be changed and i will do so.  i really appreciate any insight that you could give.  thanks!",1436417331,FALSE,BPD,2015-07-09 04:48:51,"Struggling to understand diagnosis long story short -- i have a mother who was physically/emotionally abusive and a father who was physically abusive.  i've dealt with lifelong depression/anxiety/ptsd, and have been to multiple therapists/psychiatrists, as well as tried just about every ssri medication out there and a few less typical medications (lamictal, buspar, mirtazapine, remeron, antipsychotics, probably some i'm forgetting).  i've been on some of the medications more than once and some in combination with others, with no results and a lot of side effects.

i stopped cipralex a few weeks ago which was a huge mistake, and so i started taking it again after going to the hospital. for the last few days now i've felt way better with none of the withdrawals i had before. (it was literal hell)

only thing i never tried is paroxetine and fluoxetine.

now my sister who never speaks to me just entered my room saying 'i'm coming in peace to tell you the doctors agreed to put you on haloperidol in secret because they're going to decreased the sertraline to 50mg, because your actual meds are not helping you and you're very agressive. so, please, give it a try and if it doesn't work, we just stop '.

Lamictal used to help... but possibly making me feel worse now?,"i thought i'd post this here because, while my diagnosis is a big ol' mess, the biggest things lamictal helps me with are bpd symptoms + depression and anxiety. plus i know lamictal is pretty common for bpd.

just had a bad fight with dad. physical. im out of a house for now. i have some questions for people with bpd.,"i am not diagnosed bpd.  but i have strong reasons for speculations

now questions. 

i feel like nothing is like life. nothing means anything to me. i feel like my father can do whatever he wants and i dont feel anything other than anger.  all i ever feel is anger.  all other emotions are in my head and noth physical with me body 

i took lamictal but it took away my mind. and gave me weird emotions and alot of anxiety 

i dont relate to anyone 
in always thinking about how diffeent everyone is.  

i took quetiapine but it just made me a dickwad. 

ive had xanax. shits addicting.  makes me just stupid drunk without the buzz. and i dont remember anything.  also more anxious with xans 

prozac and ssris always treated me dirty. 

aka

one time i thought god gave me this girl and i had to overdose to get her. luckily i didnt die.and i got the girl.  but dropped her after i got off the prozac and felt the drain of life once again 

second time. couldnt close my eyes without seeing me kill myself. and slit my writst with a fish blade. 

i only feel like life is real or means anything when im high

also im just a dick. but im aware of it. 



on the note of bpd. i have a very powerful abulity to not let most emotions out(except anger). but i do notice i have a tendency to infatuate about a friend/lover then hate them.  this still happened even while on lamictal. 

the degree is so low. and i almost get over the hatred after a while.  so i feel its a stretch. 


ive always enjoyed self harm but i dont do it amymore cuz scars. i could hold a dlame to my arm forever and feel nothing.  i can hold my breathe until i pass out without feeling a pull sometimes.  i just feel nothing ver.

so, i'm 27. i was first diagnosed with bpd and major depression when i was 16, after having 3 surgeries and a mrsa/osteomyelitis infection in my left ankle at age 15, and two broken metatarsals and two surgeries on my right foot at age 16. my mom was trying to prevent me from getting hooked on opiates, so she had my pediatrician prescribe me antidepressants. when i was diagnosed, i was on 300mg wellbutrin xl and 250mg zoloft. i was in constant pain, i ate tylenol and ibuprofen like candy, etc. i grew up in california, and i had friends who smoked weed, so i began smoking weed at 16 as well, to numb everything. when i was 18 i quit all antidepressants, started smoking more often, drinking, and hunting opiates because i was in constant pain. i'm still amazed i escaped that phase of my life in one piece.

anyways. that's a short version of a big part of why i am who/how i am today. i had a few toxic relationships (nothing physical. just narcissistic assholes and verbal abuse and such) and then i met the man who is now my husband (we're not legally married). i moved halfway across the country to be with him, and cut back on smoking when i moved because of the state i moved to - not nearly as common up here, and a much less populated area. i continued to smoke until i got pregnant with our beautiful daughter, and i slowly tapered down and quit smoking while i was pregnant. i smoked a few times since then but i don't enjoy it much anymore. but i used weed as a crutch, a mask, and an avoidance mechanism for my feelings and struggles. now that i haven't been regularly smoking (a total of one joint worth in two years) i am realizing just how fucked up i am mentally. after our daughter was born i got ppd, went back on zoloft, because it never gave me bad side effects and is still working well for me. after our son was born (july of last year), my depression worsened and i began having severe mood swings. i would almost compare it to what i understand bipolar to be like. i got put on lamotrigine (lamictal), started at 25mg twice daily and am now taking 75-100mg twice daily. it does significantly improve my overall control of my mood, but i still struggle sometimes. my home life is up and down, which doesn't help. i usually watch/listen to shit on youtube (currently listen to creepypasta narrations) to keep my mind distracted, but i know that's not the best way to handle things. i have been wanting to start journaling, but i never follow through with it long term. there's a lot that i'm not including in here that is probably somewhat relevant, but my thumbs are getting tired and i don't want to go overboard rambling.

tl;dr: i am just now realizing the full strength of my mental struggles and i don't know how to cope/change my self destructive, negative, procrastination patterns and thought processes. have also been stress/comfort eating a lot of sugar and chocolate, which i know does not help.

i don't know, i guess i'm just venting, looking for support, hoping i'm not alone, and hopefully figuring out how to attempt to improve myself. thank you for reading all of this if you made it down to here. ❤️",1617822610,FALSE,BPD,2021-04-07 19:10:10,"I'm not coping very well with life and such, and I am not sure where else to go - Google does not help. this will probably wind up being a long post.

and…it’s been 15 minutes since i’ve cried. 

everyone talks about how you should check on your friends who smile the most, and while that may be true i’d check on your friends who are always actually happy. do not be fooled, actual happiness and depression can coexist. am i happy? yes. do i have any reason to get out of bed in the morning, shower, feed myself, or stop watching star trek on repeat? no. have i had a reason? yes. did that reason help? no. but i am happy. i am happy that i’ve worked hard to be where i am. i’m happy that i have worked to love myself. i am happy that the people who know me love me. being happy, and feeling happy are two different things to me.  i am happy. i laugh, i smile, i talk to friends… but existing? now therein lies the problem. there is no greater torment sometimes. and while i do have friends who not only check in on me, but spend the entire day with me on facetime to help improve my mood and remind me that my existence is important to them, i am still depressed. i believe the little lies i tell them about how it’ll get better and i take their suggestions to heart but when i can’t even get out of bed to pee how can i look 5 steps ahead? 

depression, true depression, comes from deep deep desperation. depression comes from intense guilt. depression comes from years of compounding trauma that clouds your coping to the point of r e v e l i n g in that shit. depression is not wanting depression to end. because as bad as depression feels, depression feels good too. i lack the control to control myself or to get ahold of myself, and depression is the monster i know. and while i can’t control the depression, i am familiar with out of control. everything is out of control, except for getting out of bed. and for as guilty as i feel for doing this to her, the little girl inside of me finds comfort in it too.

Considering giving pharmacotherapy another go.,"i'm a 28 years old male, diagnosed as bpd when i was 18. life's much more stable than it used to, i'm living by myself and have been holding a steady job for the last 9 years but i'm still not totally normal and i feel that it affects me especially with romantic relationships, but also at work where i think i could have a much better career if i wasn't so unstable. 

i've had cbt training (unfortunately i don't have dbt in my country), have mindfulness skills and more than a year of yoga classes, but i've been lazy in the past months. i still think about suicide constantly, have lots of mood swings that i can pretend to others that are not happening but wear me down for the rest of the day. it feels as if i'm an american and i have to use manual gears in my car, but this for driving my life; so i marked an appointment with a psychiatrist this friday and am considering asking him for a prescription of lamotrigine.

i tried plenty of other drugs with undesirable side effects:

* **escitalopram** - low libido, had to quit
* **duloxetine** - brain zaps after i quit, not going to that again
* **benzodiazepines **- too good, too addictive, work in the short term but isn't something for the long term. also, memory loss
* **pregabalin** - prescribed for my insomnia, too good and i somehow felt it was even more addictive than benzos. i had to throw them off because i was eating and snorting them like candy
* **bupropion** - used it to try to quit smoking. the feeling wasn't nice
* **valproate** - wasn't prescribed, i just bought it. took for a few weeks during a breakup and despite not knowing if it helped me becoming more stable, i know that it didn't change my consciousness in undesirable ways (memory loss, loss of control, euphoria) and i felt like my normal self under the effects, that's what i'm aiming for but the need for constant blood workups and the potential hair loss are making me stay away from it

Has anyone switched all their traditional meds for CBD oil?,"hi,

(i hope this is the right sub reddit)

sorry if this is confusing im just really stressed out because my doctor wants me to go off my wellbutrin, lamotrigine and adderall and switch it for cbd oil.

i have been diagnosed with depression and (bpd which i do dbt for) and the wellbutrin and lamotrigine worked really well but i still have off weeks and my adderall is for add.

she claims that i would not need either medication and the cbd oil would help with my motivation levels. i rarely suffer from anxiety which i know a lot of people take cbd for.

im really concerned that it won't help my motivation levels and my depressive episodes and going through the whole process of switching will be pointless and affect my work/studies (because of the time and emotional resources required).

any feedback would be greatly appreciated :)

update: after literally crying to a friend about all my concerns and having a breakdown, the next day (so much calmer) i called my doctor and she literally said it's fine, she would explore other options and reminded me i was in charge of my treatment and medication.",1614743212,FALSE,BPD,2021-03-03 03:46:52,"Has anyone switched all their traditional meds for CBD oil? hi,

adhd vs borderline?,"i just want to put out here that for 2-3 years i have been amazing. i have had very strong emotions but there is a huge difference in my reactions. i was diagnosed maybe at 19-20 and i have been on lamotrigine for about a year now. my senior year of college (didn't take lamictal ) i didn't really experience any impulsiveness except those average ones of a  young adult. 

my drinking has also been significantly better. i took note of that from my last semester and how i started to manage my drinking. i don't stress drink nor drink to get drunk. this has improved the last 3 years of my life immensely academically, socially and personally. 

what i do struggle with and have been working on has been my inability to really focus. i daydream a lot, and i've recently have been playing video games that demand focus and strategy. it's really hard, but i keep trying. i have to tell myself everyday i'm not stupid even though i do feel like it sometimes when i can't get my thoughts together or i mumble. 

relationship wise. in the past, fucking terrible/ codependent/ short lived/ ect ect. but my last two have been so must easier (one without lamotrigine, the current one  on lamotrigine) and although i have had some experiences in the past (cheating, physical abuse) that would have lead me to have trust issues or insecurities in future relationships, i don't. friendship wise is better, my relationship with my boyfriend now makes me really happy. we're independent, give space, not needy from each other, encouraging, and full of trust. 

so i have to wonder, might i have adhd and my prior irresponsible life stlye might have painted it as bipolar/ borderline? i'm  25 now.  i want to focus so much better and i think i have done a lot. i am proud of myself. i'm attending a fast  paced graduate program in the fall and i can do it. i would like to see if switching over to a low dose of a non stimulant adhd medication would be better for me in the long run. lamictal has helped but i wonder if it might be my improved lifestyle and me applying cbt more in my life. the reason i got on lamictal again ( i took it my junior year, still a bad year and i stopped) and currently is because when i graduated college, i couldn't find a job was just home and it got to my head. it was also a short period where i smoked a lot of cigarrettes, (i'm off ciggs :d)

Experiences with lamictal,"after being on 25 mg for two weeks, i've now been on 50 mg of lamictal for almost two weeks. i'm going to move to 75 mg soon, which (according to my psychiatrist) is when i should start to feel something.

just wanted to know what everyone's experiences were. i've had some pretty terrible experiences with medications in the past. zoloft made me go manic (which is what caused my psychiatrist to realize that i probably have bipolar tendencies). another one which i've had (i cannot remember the name of it -- it had two names, one started with an ""m"" and the other with a ""r"") caused weight gain.

my main worry is any side effects -- particularly weight gain. i've gained the horrid freshmen 15 after starting college. also, i've gone off of my dexedrine (which majorly suppresses appetite) -- which i've been taking since i was eleven years old. it's hard to manage my appetite now that i actually feel hunger.

i've also heard that lamictal can cause lethargy. i've actually been experiencing issues with insomnia (which i'm now taking ambien for, which i hope doesn't cause weight gain as well) and briefly went off of lamictal because i couldn't sleep. what have been the experiences of people that were made more energetic by lamictal? did you still get the whole ""brain fog"" or anything?

at what dosage did you guys start to notice changes? if it helps, i'm 5'3"" and about 121 pounds -- in case my size would have anything to do with what dosage would affect me more (sorry if this is unnecessary information).

Medication,"hey everyone! i’m ac, i’m 24 and i was diagnosed with bpd a couple of years ago. i’ve been on a weird medication journey, as i’m sure most of us have, and i wanted to ask you guys

Lamictal effects?,"hey, about two months ago i started lamictal, and now i'm at 75mg; i'm also on luvox 200mg and adderall 20mg. i'd been having issues with sleep (some days could not fall asleep at all, others would sleep 12+ hours) and mood swings (obviously), so my psych wanted to try it out. to be fair, i've always been tired, but now i feel sleepy all the time. at least before i started lamictal, if i was too restless to sleep or got sleep, i could usually function without just thinking about how sleepy i am. as for my sleep schedule, it's more consistent, but i consistently sleep too little (3-5 hours a night, but i sometimes nap in addition). 

my mood is definitely more stable, but i still have mood swings. it's more that my mood swings are just far, far less extreme than they were, but they're still present. at first i thought it could be a good thing, but recently i'm feeling more and more zombie-like. my cat just died and i've been sporadically crying, but i don't feel much at all; my eyes will just water for a minute and then stop, but i won't really get the emotional release of crying. i can't remember feeling very happy, or very anxious, or very anything recently. i feel like i'm just thinking of what emotional response i would have in a situation and then acting it out. my ""mood"" changes frequently, but it can be almost unnoticeable in intensity.

other than that, i've been a bit more sensitive to light and just feel weird overall-- i described it to my psych as a dream-like state where things don't seem entirely real. i'm on a very low dose, so this is weird. does anyone else have similar experiences with lamictal? most of the stuff i've seen talks about how helpful it is, and i agree that it's stabilizing, but damn i'd rather feel my emotions and process them than just not have them at all. could these effects lessen with more time?",1555421167,FALSE,BPD,2019-04-16 13:26:07,"Lamictal effects? hey, about two months ago i started lamictal, and now i'm at 75mg; i'm also on luvox 200mg and adderall 20mg. i'd been having issues with sleep (some days could not fall asleep at all, others would sleep 12+ hours) and mood swings (obviously), so my psych wanted to try it out. to be fair, i've always been tired, but now i feel sleepy all the time. at least before i started lamictal, if i was too restless to sleep or got sleep, i could usually function without just thinking about how sleepy i am. as for my sleep schedule, it's more consistent, but i consistently sleep too little (3-5 hours a night, but i sometimes nap in addition).

"Lamotrigine - Pregabalin combination | Lamictal Lyrica | for social anxiety, sleep, mood swings","hello there,

i recently introduced pregabalin into my daily meds and am at 200 mg a day, 100 mg morning/evening, mainly for social anxiety, mood stabilisation and all that fuzz. i barely leave my house anymore and got my first 50 mg 2 months ago and slowly upped the dose. side effects were bad at first, slurred speech, increased salvia production, dizzyness but overall it was bearable, the side effects were basically nonexistant 2 weeks later.

lamotrigine is a drug i'm taking since early 2017 and i had no side effects, even at 250 mg. while i'm not sure how much it helped i think it did at least buffer out the depressive holes a bit.

is anyone of you using this combination for moods swings, (social) anxiety? got any advice or experiences?

 while i'm currently increasing pregabalin (goal is between 400 mg and 600 mg) i'm thinking about increasing lamotrigine aswell. i don't know if it's worth it though, i'm already on 2 antidepressants, and a few (well, lets say lots!) meds for organic problems, i want to keep the amount to a minimum. my breakfast is basically a hand full of pills.

also, did anyones sleep got better with taking the majority of pregabalin at noon? with better sleep i mean less intrusive thoughts, not being trapped in a cycle of thought for hours on end anymore? i tend to be awake for 2+ days straight every 2-3 weeks and barely get sleep most of the time, it makes the day unbearable. i don't want to sound weird, my psychiatrists and several doctors don't get it either, but even 80 mg of diazepam a day for 6+ weeks within a hospital didn't get me to calm down or made me tired. sometimes i think i'm on a automated program i can't stop, full of restlessness and miserable euphoria with dypshoria, if that makes sense. i often end up in the hospital, because it's usually a suicidal crisis, without me really realising. days or weeks later i 'wake up' and think ""what the fuck happened"". i somehow hope to get relief from this with meds? 

also - sorry this gets a bit long - weight gain, aaaaah what the fuck i'm eating 5k+ kcal a day! i gained so much weight, like 5 kg in 6 weeks! i know about energy content, and now that i'm a bedridden slob and eat a lot, so getting fat isn't a surprise, but why does it feel like an unbearable thirst? i don't feel saturated, ever, i could just eat eat eat. does this get any better?

I want to discuss the drug Lamictal.,"tldr; basically i’m experiencing a lot of shitty symptoms and i wanted to hear from those of you who have also taken lamictal and experienced something similar.

i’ve been taking 20mg celexa for my depression for a while now (since sometime last year, can’t remember exactly when), and recently my psychiatrist added lamictal for my bpd. he told me to take one (25mg) for the first week, two for the second week, and three for the third week and continue on three. i started with the first week and felt fine. when week two came around...i held those suckers in my hand and for some reason my gut told me not to take them. but i’ve fucked with my medications too much in the past so i decided to trust the guy with the phd.

long story short, after taking 2 pills for 5 or 6 days, i feel like death. my headache persists even worse than before; my hips, spine, and neck ache; i have a fever of 101.3 two days in a row now; constantly nauseated; and on top of that, i have rashes. everywhere. for those of you who don’t know this awesome (rare) side effect of lamictal, it’s basically where you get rashes all over your body that can develop into blisters and can cause burn-like damage to your skin, make you go blind, and eventually kill you. *yay.*

so i told my doc (pre-rashes &amp; fever) that i was experiencing some shitty symptoms and he told me to stop taking it, and start back up with 1 pill this tuesday. now that the rashes have appeared, he can suck it if he thinks i’m taking that shit again.

of course i also had to start self-diagnosing on google and a lot of my symptoms are similar to meningitis. great. 

*so finally* my question: have any lamictal users experienced this? what happened &amp; what did you do about it?",1555855071,FALSE,BPD,2019-04-21 13:57:51,"I want to discuss the drug Lamictal. tldr; basically i’m experiencing a lot of shitty symptoms and i wanted to hear from those of you who have also taken lamictal and experienced something similar.

"Invalidated, conflicted, and sick of myself.. Mood stabilizer experiences??

Largest study with Lamotrigine for BPD found it to be innefective,"&gt;we conducted a clinical trial of the mood stabiliser “lamotrigine” for people with bpd who were using mental health services. we compared the effects of lamotrigine with those of a placebo (a dummy pill that did not contain any active drug) so that neither the researchers nor the participants knew what treatment they had been given until after we had completed an initial analysis of the results of the study. we assessed mental health, social functioning, quality of life, side effects and use of services in the year after people entered the study.


​&gt;a total of 276 participants took part and 195 were followed up one year later. less than half the participants (39%) were taking trial medication regularly at one year. we found no difference in mental health or any of the other outcomes we measured between those prescribed lamotrigine and those prescribed the placebo. we checked to see if the results were affected by whether people were taking their medication regularly or not; and found no difference between those taking lamotrigine and those taking the placebo. on the basis of the results of this study, we do not recommend the use of lamotrigine for people with bpd. further research is needed to find out how best to help improve the mental health of people with this condition.

"Advice for GF with BPD struggling (ADHD, VYVANSE, LAMICTAL, THC)","long story short my girlfriend has been having a really rough time recently. she managed to turn her life around in the span of 7 months by getting a great job, going completely sober from cocaine and alcohol, moving across the country, and getting diagnosed with adhd and getting medicated (vyvanse+lamictal).
she’s doing so great and i’m so proud of her.

the issue is i’ve noticed since starting the vyvanse / lamictal her mood swings have become more frequent, and she loses the ability to rationalize. especially if there is an argument between us. 

she has been smoking weed to help with everything, but i am convinced that it is making things worse. panic attacks, dissociation, irrationality, splitting very frequently, etc. have all heightened during the period of her starting her new medicine and smoking weed.

thing is for the last two years i've had serious trouble getting out of bed in the morning. i sleep through my alarms, or wake up, try to check facebook to wake me up, fall asleep and drop my phone. or i wake up and fall straight back asleep.

part of the problem is that i just can't motivate myself to get out of bed but recently i've been turning up for work a half hour late (i make the time up at the end of the day so i'm not losing work) and obviously that isn't sustainable.

any advice? any tips? anyone gotten out of being like this? my so just doesn't really help - he's either still asleep or up way earlier because of his shifts whereas i do the standard 9-5. really would appreciate some help.

after trying lithium but getting toxicity (really need to drink water and eat if you are on this one!) i then tried lamotrigine (mood stabiliser) and after getting up to a moderate dose i have noticed a huge difference in the severity of my mood swings, i see my pdoc once a week. 
i also see a psychologist separately for 1 hr one on one talk therapy every 2 weeks and attend a dbt group twice a week (3 hr sessions) for the more 'personality problems' and relationship communication stuff and learning better coping skills for minimising destructive behaviours (self harm/ overusing my benzo's and alcohol). 
i have noticed a huge difference in my self esteem and ability to self regulate and to maintain healthier relationships compared to say 5 years ago. its still a long road and i'm not 'cured' but i feel functional and like things are really getting easier. i feel really proud of myself and still realise relapses happen but i am still in such a better place!

tl;dr: been in therapy 10 yrs and tried many different meds, in the last few months i have been given a more accurate diagnosis, found a great combo of therapy and meds and have noticed how far i have come on my recovery journey, its still bumpy but way less of a wild ride than before!",1392688752,FALSE,BPD,2014-02-18 01:59:12,"A new diagnosis, great therapy 'team', DBT group and medication are finally showing a dramatic improvement in my recovery/stabilisation of my mental health! i have been in therapy since i was 15, i am now 25.

hi, how is it going you all? i hope you are all doing fine.
i’m 19 years old and i’ve been on antidepressants since i was almost 12-13 years old.. i went through a lot and it wasn’t such a pleasant journey to me. 
i’ve experienced almost every kind of mental issues. depression, panic attacks, anxiety, seizures ( lasted for a while only ), mood swings.
i hurt myself about 3 times back in high school, but not anymore, even though i still think about it &amp; suiciding and just escaping everything. 
i believe that my psychiatric told me the diagnose by mistake, cause what happened is that she prescribed me lamotrigine, then while she was finishing the paperwork i googled ‘lamotrigine’ and searched about the purposes of describing it. i read that it’s mainly for seizures &amp; bipolar disorder. then i told her; “ but i don’t have the bipolar thing and definitely not the seizures” then she said that lamotrigine can help with bpd too then she got kinda nervous and tried to change the topic.
i felt happy that day after i left the clinic cause now finally i know that’s going on but the day after? i started to kinda panic.
now i feel kind of lost, full of regret, who am i? if bpd was controlling my behavior and attitude, then who am i? every time i got angry, pushed a friend away, ruined a beautiful relationship, made my family scared of who i am, got in a fight, or did anything stupid, was not the real me..

"Coming to Terms with BPD Diagnosis, Job Loss, First DBT Intake...Wish Me Luck","**tl;dr: so i got forced to resign from my job  of many years  after getting written up for a prior outburst.  now i need to get mentally stable enough to get a job or die.  i hope this shit works.** it's a long story, but i had some safety concerns at work that were being dismissed and i laid into my boss about it a little dramatically and was written up.  i tried to get my act together, got full psych eval, new bpd diagnosis, new meds (lamotrigine), started feeling more in control, started kicking ass at work, then landed into the er with a rash and swollen glands.  it was a set back to my self esteem and finances, but i kept on going hard with work, trying to keep up, trying to keep it up as my role as a pleaser, make people laugh, reassure everyone i'm fine.  

i knew the other shoe was gonna drop soon.   i started taking topamax 2 weeks after i stopped lamotrigine.  the effects were somewhat similar, but a lot more subtle.  the side effects were also startling.  rapid weight loss, which was initially welcome since i was struggling to lose weight from the lexapro i had stopped taking nearly a year ago.  i was also experiencing tingling numb hands/feet/face, slight lack of urgency, a little bit of confusion.  my main boss was out of town while i was on my initial dose of topamax leaving me alone with a newer manager.  i basically had a hard day, things were disorganized since my main boss was gone, i got confused and frustrated so i started to cry, asked coworkers from a different department for help.  i tried to breathe and tried not to get angry but i was still in tears.  they were lost too so they got the new manager and he came over and basically took over and laughed at me instead of helping me with the logistical issues i had to deal with at the start of a very long work day.  that toward the end of a work week.  i spent the entire weekend wracked with guilt over crying at work and potentially bumming out my coworkers or bringing down morale.  

monday i'm at work itching to talk to my manager about the issues that led to me crying and what i need to have a smoother day.  monday and i get a call from the dbt institute.  they said there was no reason why i couldn't start group right away and that i could've started a while ago.  i called them after my psych eval from 2 months ago trying to schedule an intake.  i fill out their intake paperwork online and they eventually reached out to me a week or 2 later to schedule an initial intake, then group therapy since one on one has a  year wait list.  fine awesome.  i was driving so i call back, accidentally leave a message in ""work mode"".  i have an ethnic name and go by an anglicized name for simplicity, so was like ""hi this is \_\_ from \_\_\_ company...uhhh never mind. click"".  then i called again, left another message like normal trying to schedule an appointment and they never got back to me.  got emails saying i need to sign an info release form, so i click the link to sign the form and it says the link has been expired.  i've called and left weekly messages over the phone trying to schedule intakes to get this started to learn coping skills to save my job and explained all of this over the phone with the poor receptionist.  i told her i thought it was my fault for leaving a weird confused voicemail a few months ago, that i must've scared them off or something.   she was like *ohhhh....i'm sorry, i think there was a glitch with adobe sign &amp; send...*what s fucking joke!!

anyway, since i broke down and cried at work, my manager called in my 2 bosses who i had worked with for years.  they wouldn't look me in the eyes.  the manager had only been there for a couple of months did all the talking.  he said i could either stay on and my entire workflow would change and i would be forced to work closely with him only him and if i so much as expressed any frustration at work again, i would be fired on the spot without pay.  the alternative would be resigning with severance.  i have never been fired from a job before.  i felt my whole world crashing.  all the relationships i built, the work i've accomplished, the independence i've gained from my family, the good will and reputation i've built in the industry i was working was just destroyed.

up until this point, i have had breakdowns at other jobs but have been able to mask, repress, or remove myself from public view.  i had been functioning at what i felt was an acceptable level.  i've always acknowledged my temper was an issue but never been able to admit it could be pathological. i've been getting by with repression.  since my diagnosis, i was reluctant to even read anything about bpd because of the stigma.  i also have adhd cptsd, gad, mdd.  i've been seeing the same therapist, but i think there were some things lost in translation due to cultural differences.  i always suspected i was an evil person but because of my own ignorance, i thought it meant i was officially diagnosed as evil.  the more i'm reading about it, the more i realize i'm just really fucking sad and in need of comfort a lot.  i feel guilty all the time.  my partner, bless him, has become much more understanding of me since the diagnosis.  i've reached out to my sister, the person in my family i feel closest to for support, but it's hard because i feel like i'm shattering her image of a now stable and happy family dynamic, which i'm not really a part of.  i don't hang around that much with my parents or family.  i try when things are good in my life and when i feel i'm ""presentable"" enough for them ie: financially stable, have enough to show them i'm a total fuck up, but i can't get over the physical and emotional abuse i suffered as a child, teen, and young adult.  she asked me if i had been listening to a podcast that my brother and our childhood family friend made and i tried but i can't.  i later told her the friend molested me from middle school to high school and i can't listen to it.  she said he owes me at least an apology.  i talked to her a few days later and she asked if i listened to the podcast again, then i hung up on her, sent a long text threatening suicide, told her the family is fine without me.

now i'm sitting here spiraling..i have enough money for another month's rent, a car payment, maybe a week's worth of group therapy.  i need to get stable enough to get another job.  since resigning, i've been replaying all of the interactions i've ever had with in my network wondering what they're thinking.  i didn't get a chance to say goodbye.  i don't know where to start.  filled out a form for a new therapist that seemed right up my alley a week ago but they haven't gotten back to me.  might've scared them away too.  fuck :(",1630347460,TRUE,BPD,2021-08-30 18:17:40,"Coming to Terms with BPD Diagnosis, Job Loss, First DBT Intake...Wish Me Luck **tl;dr: so i got forced to resign from my job  of many years  after getting written up for a prior outburst.  now i need to get mentally stable enough to get a job or die.  i hope this shit works.** it's a long story, but i had some safety concerns at work that were being dismissed and i laid into my boss about it a little dramatically and was written up.  i tried to get my act together, got full psych eval, new bpd diagnosis, new meds (lamotrigine), started feeling more in control, started kicking ass at work, then landed into the er with a rash and swollen glands.  it was a set back to my self esteem and finances, but i kept on going hard with work, trying to keep up, trying to keep it up as my role as a pleaser, make people laugh, reassure everyone i'm fine.  

i knew the other shoe was gonna drop soon.   i started taking topamax 2 weeks after i stopped lamotrigine.  the effects were somewhat similar, but a lot more subtle.  the side effects were also startling.  rapid weight loss, which was initially welcome since i was struggling to lose weight from the lexapro i had stopped taking nearly a year ago.  i was also experiencing tingling numb hands/feet/face, slight lack of urgency, a little bit of confusion.  my main boss was out of town while i was on my initial dose of topamax leaving me alone with a newer manager.  i basically had a hard day, things were disorganized since my main boss was gone, i got confused and frustrated so i started to cry, asked coworkers from a different department for help.  i tried to breathe and tried not to get angry but i was still in tears.  they were lost too so they got the new manager and he came over and basically took over and laughed at me instead of helping me with the logistical issues i had to deal with at the start of a very long work day.  that toward the end of a work week.  i spent the entire weekend wracked with guilt over crying at work and potentially bumming out my coworkers or bringing down morale.

Nexplanon brought back my BPD,"tl;dr — if you are on nexplanon, please consider the side effects!

i learned about bpd through reddit of all places when  a bunch of armchair psychologists threw out the term to describe a woman depicted in a meme. out of sheer curiosity, i read about it on wikipedia and was horrified when i realized most of the symptoms described what it was like for me to live every day.

i was officially diagnosed in 2016, started a mood stabilizer (lamictal), and got into intensive dbt for 6 months. it was during this time that i worked through a lot of childhood trauma and ptsd from early adulthood. i got better and better and eventually felt i was in remission. this carried on for nearly 4 years.

birth control has many effects on women regardless of their mental health. once i was on the mood stabilizer, i realized that i felt different when on or off of certain birth controls. this is because estrogenic birth controls actually inhibit the body’s ability to break down lamictal, and in turn, it becomes less effective. the most pronounced of these was ortho tri cyclen lo. when i stopped taking it, i noticed a huge improvement in my mood. suddenly i was much more confident, could focus better, and felt more talkative. as someone who has had my fair share of adventures, i knew that being in a hormonal contraceptive was a necessity. i elected to go on the nuvaring, which dampened some of the confidence/boldness i gained from coming off of ortho tricyclen lo. still, i was happy, and if i was consistently exercising, i was doing pretty well.

i got off of birth control entirely for a while due to dating a woman and then dating someone who was waiting for marriage. when both of those relationships ended, i decided to go with nexplanon, since it is a progesterone-based birth control and shouldn’t affect lamictal the way estrogen does.

within the first few days of it being implanted into my arm, i felt enraged. i remember consciously saying to myself that i felt like my bpd had returned. still, i was stubborn and wanted to stay on some form of birth control as i was in a relationship with a man.

weird, bpd symptoms started popping up again. uncontrollable anger, splitting, and feelings of emptiness. it cost me one of my relationships and it wasn’t until a couple of weeks ago when i realized i was about to lose another partner yet again.

it had gotten much worse. i began having dissociative episodes while arguing with my current partner nearly every day. some of the arguments were justified. others weren’t. part of me wonders if the side effects became more severe after i lost weight. after getting nexplanon my weight shot up to 145 lbs. i rapidly lost 15 lbs over the span of a month and a half or so, meaning that the dosage of hormone i was now receiving was most likely higher than it had been previously.

my current partner pointed out to me that his sister and ex had struggled with nexplanon due to mood issues. i took a hard look in the mirror and realized that i was exhibiting symptoms of bpd again. i was ashamed of myself.

i will say that removing it has made a huge difference in my basal stress levels. i no longer feel like everyone is so fucking annoying/stupid/wrong all the time. i feel relaxed for the first time in a long time. 

my point for writing all of this is to warn other women who are looking into this birth control. i’ve never been on anything that has made me so angry before. it was terrifying and my relationship is still mending because of it (and also for other reasons related to not disclosing my bpd).",1596325565,FALSE,BPD,2020-08-01 23:46:05,"Nexplanon brought back my BPD tl;dr — if you are on nexplanon, please consider the side effects!

“Break Ups” by BPD,"29yr old f - bipolar 2 with bpd. too many posts about borderlines and not enough from a borderline’s perspective.

here’s what it’s like: my boyfriend broke up with me after a year of your typical bpd lying, manipulation, and extreme emotions. i struggle badly with dissociation and half the time couldn’t own up to doing these things because i genuinely don’t remember them happening. anyways, he gets tired of it and bails. everything shatters. and i mean everything. i am completely broken. i am drowning.

switch now i’m full blown manic. two days later i download tinder. try to find his one friend who i know is on it, this is the best idea i’ve ever had. this makes so much sense. i should fuck his friend, i just want to hurt him because he hurt me. match with his friend. get a text from the ex about it. now he’s just mad and i look crazy. he proceeds to take the day shouting at me for downloading tinder so soon and for trying to fuck his friend. i am malicious. i am manipulative. 

my cousin’s girlfriend, sets herself on fire in a hotel parking lot. i get scared because not much separates me from her except one extreme emotion. i’m full of extreme emotions. i begin an iop, start lamictal. 4 days of therapy 7 days of meds. i can’t tell if i’m starting to get depressed or if this is just how normal people feel. i have no mood fluctuations, i just exist. i text my ex this. “im changing” i internally scream. he just wants his stuff back.

i go to drop off his stuff. purposely wait until after 11pm so i can try and plug in a “can i stay over, it’s too late to find street parking by my house now.” we have sex, i stay the weekend. he makes me breakfast and i go to rite aid to get us drinks. i know his favorite morning drink, i don’t even have to ask. i am truly the only person capable of loving him this good. i am elated. i am back baby! i am the king of new york! literally no one in human history has ever been this good! he tells me i have to go home because he has a show to go to. i cry. i cry several times. i physically can’t let go of him. i am clinging to him. if i step foot outside this apartment i know i will never be let back in. i am malicious, manipulative.

i ask him to go ice skating the following day. no response. ok that’s fine, i’ve been practicing mindfulness. i got this. people get busy. i text him again the day after that. no response. i go up a dose on lamictal, i stay up later each night. sending a single text. checking instagram every 3-5 minutes to see if he’s been online. if he’s been online, then why can’t he answer my text? whose this girl he started following on instagram? she’s cute. i’ll check her profile every 3-5 minutes. oh she posted a story? it’s her and my ex playing games at dave and busters. what the fuck. what the fuck. 

i start to not eat much, i don’t need it. i’m psychically not hungry. i order mozzie sticks at work during my 11 hour shift, i have one. i’m full. i start to panic. so begins lamictal induces mania. i text my ex “if i get off this couch right now i’m going to kill myself”. it’s true, i will do it. he doesn’t respond. i stay on the couch for 3 full days before taking myself back down to my original lamictal dose. i keep checking her instagram for more stories of him. i am malicious and manipulative. 

a day or so later, coworker texts me a screenshot of a tinder profile. “isn’t this your ex?”. sure is. after he gave me shit for having a tinder so many moons ago, i am enraged. i search instagram far and wide for the girl of his dreams. i download tinder. armed with another beautiful girl’s photos i swipe furiously until i find him. “super like”. we match. or should i say “ellen” and him match. we talk. we chat. i ask him all the things i’ve been dying to ask him since seeing him last. we set up a date. a dive bar by my house. after a few days of talking he has softened me. i’m no longer angry, i want to be his savior. i’ll show up to the dive bar. after he gets stood up, i’ll be there. to take care of him. i am the only person in the world capable of loving him. he ends up bailing on my catfish date. i am broken. i am shattered. i am malicious, manipulative. 

my iop wraps up. i’m left alone. from 4 days of intensive therapy to being completely alone. over this 2 month journey i’ve isolated enough to convince myself that my ex is the only one i can depend on. no one not a single soul will ever love me like he did. despite the texts i receive throughout the week of people checking in on me. i tell him i say “i can’t set this boundary, i need you to set me free. i’m not strong enough to do it”. he tells me “i have no intention of getting back together with you”. i am broken and incomplete. i am drowning and i am scared. my chest hurts. i am physically shattered. but taking my therapy seriously. i need to respect him. 

it’s been 2.5 months since the breakup and i still have to repeat out loud to myself every single night to leave him alone. to not check his instagram. to not text him. to stop manipulating him, whether for good or bad. i do my dbt workbook. i’ve been sober for 2 months. i bought an indoor exercise bike. i’ve been trying to find the good in it. to focus on me.

my iop wraps up. i’m left alone. from 4 days of intensive therapy to being completely alone. over this 2 month journey i’ve isolated enough to convince myself that my ex is the only one i can depend on. no one not a single soul will ever love me like he did. despite the texts i receive throughout the week of people checking in on me. i tell him i say “i can’t set this boundary, i need you to set me free. i’m not strong enough to do it”. he tells me “i have no intention of getting back together with you”. i am broken and incomplete. i am drowning and i am scared. my chest hurts. i am physically shattered. but taking my therapy seriously. i need to respect him. 

it’s been 2.5 months since the breakup and i still have to repeat out loud to myself every single night to leave him alone. to not check his instagram. to not text him. to stop manipulating him, whether for good or bad. i do my dbt workbook. i’ve been sober for 2 months. i bought an indoor exercise bike. i’ve been trying to find the good in it. to focus on me.

Experience taking Lamotrigine?,"i recently went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed lamotrigine - a mood stabilizer. i had a huge episode of borderline rage, and it really pushed me to see a psychiatrist. my regular therapist said it was a good idea as long as i didn't intend to stay on it forever, which i don't. he also said that since we were beginning to get into deeper stuff in therapy (doing less damage control and going deep into my upbringing), the mood stabilizer will help manage stress and other emotions i'll be feeling as a result of this.

i started lamotrigine on 25mg for two weeks, and i am about to go up another 25mg (as prescribed). my psychiatrist said with this medication, it takes a long time to get to a therapeutic dose. 

anyone taking this, how much are you on as a ""therapeutic dose?""

also, side effects i've been having are:

\- dizziness when standing up too fast

\- more tired at the end of the day

\- heart palpitations

\- loss of appetite (though, i am making a point to consciously think about when i need to eat, so it's not really an issue)

\- losing my train of thought

what are other side effects you all experienced going further into medication?

the positives

\- i have significantly cut down on drinking (though i don't know that you're really supposed to drink at all on this medication). i went from binge drinking 3-4 days a week to having one or two drinks about twice a week. i haven't gotten drunk at all. 

\- i am actually able to contain my emotions and haven't had borderline rage or feelings that are too intense since starting. i don't know if it's a placebo effect of just knowing i'm on the medication, a result of being more tired and not really having the energy for that, or the medication already having a positive effect.

\- i have gotten other parts of my life together and overall feel like an improved person (looking for a new apartment, decluttering, managing money well (also not spending so much on alcohol), and consolidating &amp; refinancing my loans). 

\- i can tell i have a better sense of self-worth, maybe just as a result of taking charge of this.

i'm supposed to go up to 50mg in three days. i just want to know what other peoples' experiences are on this! my therapist said this week that he is already amazed at how well i am doing. it makes me feel good that he is proud of me, and it gives me more motivation to get better.",1532100397,FALSE,BPD,2018-07-20 15:26:37,"Experience taking Lamotrigine? i recently went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed lamotrigine - a mood stabilizer. i had a huge episode of borderline rage, and it really pushed me to see a psychiatrist. my regular therapist said it was a good idea as long as i didn't intend to stay on it forever, which i don't. he also said that since we were beginning to get into deeper stuff in therapy (doing less damage control and going deep into my upbringing), the mood stabilizer will help manage stress and other emotions i'll be feeling as a result of this.

hiya pals. i’ve been diagnosed bipolar 1 for four years now. i fit the classic definition of bipolar / i had 4 manias and depressions in a year, each lasting weeks or months.   

i take 900 mg lithium, 200 mg lamictal, 2 mg risperdal, and 10 mg lexapro (i should be on 60 mg latuda if i could afford it).   

but i still wasn’t 100% okay. i fervently hated myself. i was constantly suicidal. i reacted poorly to the slightest bit of feedback.   

i told my new psych i felt that my self hatred was psychotic. she dismissed me.   

2 months later i see a therapist and in 20 min he diagnoses me with borderline.   

today, on my 25th birthday, my psych confirmed i have both bipolar and borderline.   

honestly, i’m so happy. this whole i thought i was this awful person who just couldn’t keep up with adulthood. it was like i was on fire and people were telling me to just not be on fire.   

i now know that i can get better. i can do dbt. i can practice self compassion. i can do the exercises.

finally, i looked into dbt and bpd obviously came up. i have spent the last few weeks diving deep into bpd.  i looked at notes my dr wrote from the first session and reflected on my past and it seems bps fits and explains things that don’t fit adhd unlike i thought (fear of abandonment, feelings of emptiness, etc). 
 

question: on thursday i am going to see my psychiatrist to get a referral to see a different psychiatrist to get approved for dbt at a clinic….. while i’m there i want to bring up the possibility of a bpd diagnosis. how do i go about this? do i just straight ask? do i list my history of symptoms or other preparation? is it even worth it as i have a treatment plan? will she eventually just tell me? i wonder if it’s just confirmation bias which could mess up the diagnosis? anything else i should know? i don’t know how much of an impact a formal diagnosis will have in my life or what the point is.

#  study description

the purpose of this study is to test the potential of the rapid-acting anti-depressant ketamine to decrease suicidality in borderline **personality disorder** (bpd). the rate of completed suicide in bpd is similar to that of depression or schizophrenia. there is currently no specific medication treatment for bpd.

ketamine is an fda-approved anesthetic agent that has been shown to rapidly decrease suicidality and improve mood in people with major depressive **disorder** (mdd). though symptoms overlap, effective treatments for mdd and bpd differ. this clinical trial tests if ketamine also decreases suicidality and improves mood in bpd. this trial will also measure several other outcomes after ketamine versus placebo in bpd: adverse events, bpd symptoms, pain, social cognition, and neuroplasticity.

# detailed description:

this clinical trial primarily tests the impact of ketamine on suicidal thoughts in borderline personality disorder (bpd). it also tests the impact of ketamine on symptom intensity (for mood, bpd, and pain symptoms), social cognition, and neuroplasticity in people with bpd.

suicidal ideation and action are too common in bpd, occurring at rates similar to those in people with depression or schizophrenia. intensive psychotherapy helps, but many people with bpd do not have access to that treatment, and not everyone responds to psychotherapy if they do get access. no medication is fda-approved for bpd, and no medication has been shown to decrease suicidality in bpd.

ketamine is a promising medication for this problem. it is an fda-approved anesthetic medication with n-methyl d-aspartate activity. sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine decrease suicidality and improve mood in people with major depressive disorder (mdd). this effect is rapid, with symptom improvement within hours that endures approximately two weeks. people with bpd can have symptoms that overlap with those of mdd, however, the effective treatments for bpd and mdd differ. this clinical trial will test if ketamine, which is effective in mdd, is also effective in bpd.

the investigators will use semi-structured interviews and self-report questionnaires to measure suicidal ideation and clinical symptoms (adverse events, mood symptoms, bpd symptoms, and pain). social cognition will be also be measured using both interviews/questionnaires and cognitive psychology tasks. one proposed mechanism of ketamine's effect in mdd is increased neuroplasticity - opening a window during which new learning can occur. this mechanism has been demonstrated in rodent models of depression. in bpd, negatively-biased social interpretations impede meaningful recovery and increase suicide risk over time. a post-ketamine neuro-plastic window may provide an opportunity for revisions of rigid social attributions. the investigators will test for changes in neuroplasticity using a cognitive psychology task and electro-encephalography.

#  study description

the purpose of this study is to test the potential of the rapid-acting anti-depressant ketamine to decrease suicidality in borderline **personality disorder** (bpd). the rate of completed suicide in bpd is similar to that of depression or schizophrenia. there is currently no specific medication treatment for bpd.

ketamine is an fda-approved anesthetic agent that has been shown to rapidly decrease suicidality and improve mood in people with major depressive **disorder** (mdd). though symptoms overlap, effective treatments for mdd and bpd differ. this clinical trial tests if ketamine also decreases suicidality and improves mood in bpd. this trial will also measure several other outcomes after ketamine versus placebo in bpd: adverse events, bpd symptoms, pain, social cognition, and neuroplasticity.

when i started lamotrigine i got my period like the next day, so missed my pms week(s). i‘m also currently not diagnosed because my psychiatrist said that “a diagnosis doesn’t really matter as long as the moods are managed.”

i think increasing my mood stabilizers increased my impulsivity?,"i recently upped my lamictal from 100 mg (sub therapeutic dosage) to 150 mg after 4 months. the reason i didn’t up sooner was because i had fucking insane vivid dreams after taking it and my psychiatrist wanted to wait until i wasn’t experiencing them before continuing. i’m actually still experiencing them, im just used to them now. even the ones that should be terrifying don’t scare me. it still fits his criteria of wanting it to be no longer distressing, so i mean...

anyways, i was prescribed lamictal whilst in inpatient to reduce impulsivity and compulsions. it really has done wonders, especially at helping me curb the urge to lie for attention. i haven’t had any huge compulsions to lie since getting on these meds! small ones still surface occasionally, but im much better at resisting them. i’m also much better at managing the urge for destructive behavior, and in general i’ve had a lot of success. however, ever since it upped i’ve become more impulsive. it’s only been a week on 150 and i’ve had so many impulsive urges which to avoid hurting readers won’t be listed. one of my biggest concerns though is contacting people i shouldn’t, like, really shouldn’t be contacting. fortunately, the urge to lie is still under control, which was the biggest benefit and so long as i can retain that im not really inclined to go off lamictal entirely.

I'm completely unhinged and everyone thinks I'm doing great,"hello everyone, i went off my meds! how thrilling right?!^notreallyno

i was on paxil (i take lamictal and stuff too but besides the point) for a little while and it was helping my mood. i stopped crying all the time, a lot of the intrusive thoughts disappeared, and i've actually managed to hold down a semi-new job but in 3 months i've gained over 15lbs and i hate myself and feel so disgusting. cant even look at myself.

well, as i mentioned initially, i had this great idea to make myself feel better! what better way to feel better than stop taking your antidepressant, right?

now i'm puking every day immediately after i eat nearly every time! i'm constantly nauseous oh and i'm shitting like all the time and crying and im pretty sure i just broke up with my poor boyfriend who i love. getting brain zaps like all day and thinking about cutting (i swear i'm not gonna cut though) the withdrawals are no joke and would you believe i've *been* through this before?!?!?! lmao didnt learn my lesson and now i feel like i'm dying. again. good job sage, fucking dumb fuck lol. obviously the easiest thing to do would be get back on the paxil, duh but nope i'm too big of an asshole and i refuse 

i even ghosted my psychiatrist last week because i didnt feel like telling her what i did. and i really like her, shes great. probably not gonna even try to make another appointment though haha because that makes sense right?

i've just been popping ativan all day at work, then i as soon as i get home every day im smoking so much fucking weed, drinking really high abv beers, masturbating way too much and rewatching got and tpb for the 90000th time all this to deal with the withdrawals and i kind of feel like picking up a bottle of bourbon for the weekend

did i mention like everyone thinks i'm doing great

How long did it take to get an accurate BPD diagnosis? How many times were you misdiagnosed? I'm feeling discouraged.,"back story: about 10 years ago i was diagnosed with bipolar 2. got on lamictal and it drastically improved my depression. however, it did not do anything for my supposed hypomanic episodes. i was told lamictal doesn't treat the hypomanic part of bipolar 2 and it only treats the depression part. this started the journey of medication after medication combination that never seemed to do anything as my life continued to fall apart. all of my relationships have failed mainly because of my suspicions/paranoia, jealousy, accusations, and the hurtful words and actions that quickly followed. that and my irresponsible and destructive behavior. my last resort was lithium which is a medication i refused to try until i had exhausted all other options. when i got on lithium, i became extremely suicidal. so, i was put on seroquel in addition to it to balance everything out. i no longer felt as suicidal, but the side effects were terrible. i lost what little motivation i had to do anything. i didn't laugh anymore. i didn't cry. my memory was almost non existent. the only thing i gained from those medications was weight. i still had my outbursts, jealousy, suspicions, hurtful actions, destructive behavior, all the same shit. finally, i was done with it. last march, i began the process of weaning off of the meds. i've been off of them now for about 6-7 months. 

here we are now: i've always felt like i either didn't have bipolar 2 or that i had something else going on too. nothing made sense and i got so very hopeless. one day my girlfriend sent me a link about the negative ideas that people have about bpd and how misunderstood the disorder is. then it gave insight and information about the disorder and how to treat it. the reason she sent this to me is because she thought that bpd stood for bipolar disorder, which made me think so as well because i really didn't know what bpd was. as i'm reading this, i'm thinking.. that doesn't really sound like what i've heard bipolar disorder described as, but that sure as hell fits exactly what i've gone through for as long as i can remember. that is when i discovered what bpd is. since then i have watched every video available, read books and done all the research i possibly can on this disorder. i finally made an appointment with a psychologist, and i went to that appointment earlier today. 
he did his initial evaluation and at the end of the session, he told me that at this point he would diagnose me with bipolar 2, anxiety disorder, and gambling disorder. i was very upset and asked him if he felt like i didn't meet the criteria for bpd. he said he doesn't feel like i do, but if i would like, we can explore that during our next session. i am extremely upset by this and i'm wondering if it takes multiple sessions for the doctor to realize what is going on and give an accurate diagnosis? do i even bother going back to this psychologist? do i trust what he's saying and let go of the idea of what i think is going on? has anyone else experienced this before? am i losing my absolute mind???

"Lamotrigine, PMSing, and cannabis","i have a few questions for people (mostly women, but also cannabis users) who are taking lamotrigine. 

i have been taking it for a few months. i was sitting at 150mg for about two weeks, and i honestly felt like it was helping a lot and i was a bit more stable and in control. and then i got to my final dose of 200mg a few weeks ago and i feel everything went to shit ! 

the episodes are so aggravated now. i feel extremely sensitive and scared all of the time. i upped my dose and started pmsing the next week, and it got so bad that i have been lashing out every day since then. i thought maybe it’s just because i’m so hormonal and the increase collided with the pms. my period was so late and i read that lamotrigine can do that, so my pms symptoms were extended a week and a half past what they should’ve been, and they were a lot more intense. 

has this happened to any of you before? will the intensity of my feelings, and the extreme sensitivity go away when i get “settled” into the 200mg? or is this not normal and i should get back to 150mg when i can tell my psychiatrist? it didn’t happen with any of the previous increases. 

now about the weed: i was a daily smoker for about two years, it helped immensely in stopping an episode and it also just relaxed me with the right indica strain, or it makes me happy and euphoric when it’s more a sativa/hybrid. up until 150mg, using it was still fine and it did what it usually does. once i made the switch to 200, it stopped being fine. 

now, both strains i’ve tried, even ones low in thc count, are giving me panic attacks. i was using a strain while on the 150 that i really liked, it was working great for me, but once i did the increase that very same strain made me freak out and panic so hard that i threw up. thought it was a one time thing so i went and got a nice indica, and it happened again. so i thought maybe i was using too much, so i tried a really tiny hit the next day and it still gave me the bad anxiety, but i didn’t throw up that time. so i have stopped smoking. 

has this happened to anyone else??? note that i haven’t tried smoking actual flower since i upped the dose, all three times were using my dab pen. is this normal? do lamotrigine and marijuana just collide in a bad way? because for the first few months trying to get to my final dose, they didnt collide at all. pleaaase tell me if this is normal. also, if this has happened to you, would smoking flower maybe be better than concentrates? or did it happen whilst using flower? does this even have anything to do with lamotrigine at all??",1530209021,FALSE,BPD,2018-06-28 18:03:41,"Lamotrigine, PMSing, and cannabis i have a few questions for people (mostly women, but also cannabis users) who are taking lamotrigine.

BPD and Meds,"hello, i'm new to this subedit so this will be my first post. i've been diagnosed with bpd for about a year now after a long time of misdiagnosis's and lots of trial and error with meds. i've been through 6 different medications and most of them either gave me unbearable side effects or didn't work. for the most part they made me feel very emotionally numb and everything felt like it was just going through the motions. has anyone had positive experiences with meds to help their bpd? my last psychiatrist didn't believe in using meds for treatment so i was never prescribed something for my actual diagnosis so i was wondering if anyone is taking meds for their bpd that actually makes them feel ""normal""

Codependent “cyclothymic/bipolar spectrum” individual with questions for those of you affected with Borderline Personality Disorder,"disclaimer: im not seeking a diagnosis from any of you. (i would only leave such claims to medical “professionals”). im looking for trends amongst this community’s illness that may be prominent in my dysfunctional lifestyle so that i can seek more effective help for once in my life. i need professional help. any of your input is greatly appreciated, thank you for taking the time to read my post.

hello. i’ve been treated for bipolar spectrum illness for almost 3 years. ive been suicidal since i was 12. i’m 18. 

i feel like i’ve been misdiagnosed for the reason that i have extremely codependent tendencies. dangerously on and off in my relationship, anger and love in constant battle that destroys my life. literally feeling like dying without her. then wanting to never see her again. taking sleeping pills when she wont talk to me. blocking her when she triggers me.

in my research behind codependent relationships (online lectures and books by psychotherapists specializing in codependent relationships) i have found that an individual with any type of personality disorder is usually a key ingredient for a codependent relationship. a dysfunctional person, one who denies being ill and refuses treatment (me).

my parents dont force me to have a pdoc/therapist because one is absentee and the other is sort-of easy to fool. i prefer to hide my problems because theres so much social stigma around being a mentally dysfunctional male.

i’ve been hospitalized for suicide
had drug and alcohol problems
major depressive episodes
cyclothymic hypomania (never full mania)
been on paxil, seroquel, lamictal, xanax, zoloft (prescription) 
i no longer take medication because i would abuse it to try to hurt myself, and i had a lot of nightmarish side effects. i also believe that my old psychiatrist was over medicating me which has made me distrustful of psychiatrists and medication. this psychiatrist (one ever saw him) was retiring and didnt care about me, i dont know why i went to him. i was too young to understand what a good psychiatrist was like. i use extensive exercise and bad coping mechanisms to calm myself down when needed.

my question is, do you find any similarity between your problems in mine. were any of you called manic-depressed before you were called bpd? is codependency something that most of you struggle with?

what do you do to cope? meditation, exercise, psychiatric medication?

seriously, any input is really appreciated. i need the help of a therapist and i need to stop lying to myself about being normal. i need to stop denying treatment. again, thank you for taking the time to read my post. it means a lot to me, to hear from people who know first-hand what it is like to have bpd.",1518655342,FALSE,BPD,2018-02-15 00:42:22,"Codependent “cyclothymic/bipolar spectrum” individual with questions for those of you affected with Borderline Personality Disorder disclaimer: im not seeking a diagnosis from any of you.

"I’m new here, and I need to say some stuff I haven’t told anyone.","first, i should start off by saying i have not been formally diagnosed with bpd.  i have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, eating disorder, &amp; also pmdd.  ssris always made me nauseous, and my doctor told me some people experience that with ssris.  in may, he suggested i try lamotrigine, and i’ve stuck with that now for 4 months.  when he prescribed it, i researched it &amp; realized it’s used a lot to treat bipolar (as well as other things).  again, he told me it was just being used in my case for major depression.  i looked into bipolar, and i don’t really think that’s what i suffer from.  i do think i exhibit many signs of bpd, but obviously, i’m not a doctor so i am just speaking from my heart on this one.  overall, i’ve felt a lot more in control on the medicine (lamotrigine).  the doctor also prescribed me xanax for pmdd.  it’s only to take the 1-2 days i usually feel hormonal changes around my period and they are only a very small dose.  i also have a therapist that i see biweekly, and i’ve been in therapy on and off for years.

with this regimen, i haven’t had any episodes &amp; was feeling really positive...until this last week.  last week, i started/created a huge fight with my fiancée.  i’ve done this in the past, but i thought i had made major progress and was past those behaviors.  i started a fight about something that could hypothetically happen in the future, so in retrospect, an absolutely pointless fight.  i screamed horrible things at him like i hate him, i didn’t want to be with him anymore, i wanted him to move out, i wanted to cancel the wedding.  i pushed him to the point that he was mad, and then i played the victim when he stood up for himself &amp; said some stuff back.  i drug the fight on for a few days until i finally snapped out of it...and then i apologized a million times.  

i’m just so scared that one of these days - he won’t forgive me &amp; i’ll be out of “second chances”.  i’ve been in therapy &amp; seeing psychiatrists for years, so it actually breaks my heart that i feel so fucked up still.  i want so badly to be better &amp; to be stable &amp; to be nice &amp; to be someone worthy of love.

to catch you up to speed a bit more, here’s a little bit about my patterns &amp; life:
-i am 29/female.
-i am privileged and i never worried about money when i was growing up.
-i was a very good student.
-i am a perfectionist.  i am high functioning, so no one really has any idea what’s going on.  i’m an attorney, and licensed in multiple states.
-i was anorexic in high school &amp; i have always had body dysmorphia.  after being physically abused, i developed binge eating disorder.  body dysmorphia has been consistent throughout.
-i have always been a loner.  i’ve never had many girl friends.  i have a few best friends, but for majority of my life (especially adolescence), i had really no friends.
-i grew up in the south.  my parents are atheist, so many families wouldn’t even let my classmates/other kids hang out with me.  i also grew up feeling kind of lost... like no moral compass or purpose.
-my parents didn’t really have friends - they just hung out with each other.
-when i was a teenager, i had horrible fights with my parents.  i also said horrible things &amp; i would do rebellious things for seemingly no reason.
-as a teenager, i exaggerated a lot.
-i didn’t do drugs (and i only drank a little) in high school, but i did lie a lot to my parents.
-i started to validate myself through men.  in teen years, i slept around.
-i tend to isolate myself socially.  but simultaneously, i get lonely &amp; wish i had more of a support system.
-from about 18 to present day, i have been monogamous &amp; in serial long term relationships.
-my first real relationship was extremely fucked up &amp; mentally abusive, and i was very reckless in it (unprotected sex, etc).  it lasted about a year.
-i started seeing a counselor when i was 18.
-my 2nd big relationship was even more fucked.  it lasted about 4 years.  he hit me.  we had explosive verbal fights prior to him getting physical.  i also made bad decisions like try molly with him one night.
-i am not a regular drinker &amp; i don’t use any illegal drugs.  in college, i definitely would binge drink &amp; i tried smoking weed.  but, it was clearly social as i don’t like either.
-i also was raped on a night of heavy drinking when i was 19.
-during some seasons of my life, i light up a room &amp; i am the life of the party so to speak.  during other seasons, i can’t get out of bed &amp; i am so depressed.
-i have a history of having rocky relationships &amp; being prone to conflicts.  i used to chalk it up to girls being mean, but it’s happened so much that i’m likely the culprit.
-i am not suicidal but i have stated i wanted to kill myself a few years ago in a fight with my fiancée.  if i am being honest, it was manipulation.  it is so fucked and i hate myself for it.
-i am extremely negative and cynical.
-i do have a history of “intense” relationships.
-i do have a very sarcastic sense of humor.
-i am able to hold jobs &amp; i typically have kept same jobs for at least 2 years, and i always give employers full 2 week notice.
-i have dogs, and i love them and take care of them.  i experience no anger or anything.
-i’ve never physically hurt anyone or anything.
-i only have episodes with people i’m close to (ie my parents, my sibling, my fiancé).  i do not have episodes with friends, coworkers, strangers, bosses.
-some days, i don’t feel like doing anything but laying around.  other days, i will run or ride bike.
-most days, after work, i zone out &amp; just watch tv or something.
-i am extremely giving &amp; i always try to do things or get things for my fiancé or family (like sentimental or heart felt items).
-i enjoy cooking, and i cook most days.  if i’m depressed, i won’t cook.
——
my current relationship is what i would consider my only “normal” relationship i’ve ever had.  we have been together 3 years &amp; he is the best guy and the love of my life.  he is 33/male.  i have no trust issues with him, and neither of us has ever cheated.  he has never abused me.  he has been patient with me.  in the beginning of our relationship (about 7 months), i never had an episode.  i was extremely happy, and i felt stable.  after the first episode, i felt so sad &amp; like “omg no i am going to be alone forever - i still have these mental issues” - and for about a year, i had many episodes.  

when i say episode, i mean that the following typically happens:
-it occurs the week before my period (2-3 day range).  it does not occur every month.  for example, it hasn’t occurred at all in last 5 months or so (until last week).
-i start a fight
-i say horrible things and most of which are things i truly don’t mean (ie i hate you, fuck you, we are done, etc)
-i accuse him of being the mean one &amp; abusive
-i push him to point of saying he doesn’t wanna be with me &amp; then act like he’s abandoning me
-i bring up stuff that doesn’t even bother me &amp; start acting like it does (ie “i always do the dishes”) just to add fuel to the fire
-when i finally snap out of it (typically 2 days), i am so ashamed and embarrassed.  i apologize profusely but the damage is done.

——
i genuinely feel terrible and crazy.  i am willing to do anything.  i do not know what to do.  i do not want to lose my fiancée.  we are getting married in a few months.  more than anything, i do not want to ruin his whole life by having him waste it on a marriage to a garbage person.

he has been so caring, and he’s extremely sensitive and supportive to whatever underlying mental health issue i have.  he’s never shamed me, and he’s fully supported whatever i need to make me feel more whole.

i love him a lot, and i want to be better for him.  obviously, i want to be better for myself as well.  i wish more than anything in the world that i could be stable and not have any episodes in the future where i lose my shit &amp; get angry &amp; treat any loved one like shit.  before this pattern with romantic partners, i feel like i did this as a teenager to my parents.

i do truly think i have bpd, and again, i’m not speaking on a whim or trying to insult anyone with an actual diagnosis.  but, i am wholeheartedly coming to this forum for a shimmer of light, hope, or positivity.  i am not sure if anyone else experiences episodes close in time to hormonal changes/period, but that is typically when my episodes happen (if they happen).

i’ve done talk therapy for 11 years.  i’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for about 6 years.  i just don’t know what else to do?  i would love any tips, stories, or words that anyone can offer on their thoughts and what they think i can do to manage this disorder.  i want to be the person i know i’m capable of being &amp; the person that exists a lot of the time.  i want this disorder to be in remission.  i am all ears.  i am willing to do the work, and i have been for years in therapy.  i just don’t feel i’ve made that much progress on managing this.

i appreciate and thank you in advance for your responses.  if you don’t respond, thank you for reading this &amp; let me say this to someone.  i am crying as i write this because i just feel so horrible for how i’ve treated people during my life.  i do feel thankful to be alive, but i wish i never had episodes or days like i’ve had.",1568575945,FALSE,BPD,2019-09-15 19:32:25,"I’m new here, and I need to say some stuff I haven’t told anyone. first, i should start off by saying i have not been formally diagnosed with bpd.  i have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, eating disorder, &amp; also pmdd.  ssris always made me nauseous, and my doctor told me some people experience that with ssris.  in may, he suggested i try lamotrigine, and i’ve stuck with that now for 4 months.  when he prescribed it, i researched it &amp; realized it’s used a lot to treat bipolar (as well as other things).  again, he told me it was just being used in my case for major depression.  i looked into bipolar, and i don’t really think that’s what i suffer from.  i do think i exhibit many signs of bpd, but obviously, i’m not a doctor so i am just speaking from my heart on this one.  overall, i’ve felt a lot more in control on the medicine (lamotrigine).  the doctor also prescribed me xanax for pmdd.  it’s only to take the 1-2 days i usually feel hormonal changes around my period and they are only a very small dose.  i also have a therapist that i see biweekly, and i’ve been in therapy on and off for years.

so far i feel miserable. i took it tuesday night (and stopped cymbalta). didn't sleep well. i was fine until about 1pm yesterday when all of a sudden it felt like i was really high. i got some lunch but that didn't help. i ended up leaving work.

i got really down last night, couldn't sleep well at all. woke up this morning with really bad body pain, very very sad, super lonely. i am off work this morning to have a plumber over but i just don't think i have the strength to go in at all today.

how long will this last? i don't want to give up 2 days in. 

my soul aches with sadness and loneliness. i'm wasting my time on a guy who isn't even sure when he'll be in the same state as me again. i'm doing emotional labor for another guy who just last week was suicidal and now is all happy as can be because he had a hookup that went really well. i was trying to plan a birthday lunch for my work best friend but since i'm not there her supervisor (who she hates) has taken credit for it.

BDP and delusional jealousy: any medication effective?? Want to save my relationship!,"bdp sucks. i suspected something was wrong with me for a long time, my  emotions were too extreme, i was too sensitive to anything around me. a minor slight felt crushing, i was socially anxious, not many friends, overreacting constantlyy. if people were late for appointments i thought i was being disrespected and 2 or 3 times of that and i'd  cut ties. everything was too extreme. extreme joy, spontaneity and excitement and extreme sadness, depression and loneliness. never been suicidal though...although my father passed away when i was a kid that way...(sight). i was diagnosed add 2 years ago, but that didn't explain everything, so a few months ago my psych upon my insistence revealed that i'm borderline. he believed labels such as bdp have a negative impact. and that treating the symptoms without labeling people is best. so he didn't want to tell me what he thought i suffered from.
 
my main issue is that im easily offended and incredibly jealous. i've always been incredibly jealous (due to fear of abandonment, rejection etc), but my current partner was keeping an a light emotional affair by text and calls for several months,  that i found out about, and i was devastated. so i'm not longer sure if my jealousy is unjustified, or if when i overreacted i'm just being delusional. 

what seems extreme to me is how seemingly unimportant things trigger me. and then i spiral down. for instance, saying he was going to sleep and seeing him online for a long time on whatsapp triggered the last bout of jealousy. my mood changed immediately, intrusive thoughts and scenarios of deceit  populate my head and i can't tell him cause it's ridiculous and i'm embarrassed of myself for being so hypersensitive and jealous for something so small. so just imagine how my reaction would be if i see him casually flirt with a woman or a friend of mine, i think i'd go nuts. and by nuts i mean i get silent, stonewall him for days, get enraged inside and eventually it bursts out into a destructive fight, him feeling like shit and despondent and me apologizing. he doesn't know i have bdp, my doc thinks again it's unhelpful to tell my partner my diagnosis. it could lead to him blaming me for everything bad that happens between us (because ""i'm sick in the head"") even when he is partially responsable.   i also get offended by the slightest thing, i have no thick skin. only a thin layer on top of a raw open wound called bpd,  triggered by childhood trauma, i've been told. 

i'm afraid of ruining my relationship with this chronic jealousy and bdp rage. but there is a part of my brain that thinks that it could be justified and i should trust my instinct, that if he did it once he can do it again. yet that's not always true. 

ive been taking bupropion for about 3 years for depression, and i think it keeps depression at bay. and for my bpd i take lamotrigine (50mg+50mg per day) and abilify (5mg in the morning). i take ritalin sporadically on a ""need basis"" for add.

i think abilify is doing it's thing, and has effectively toned down my reaction to jealousy, i don't act on it so much, i control myself more, but the jealous thoughts are still there to some extent. i noticed since taking it (3 weeks now) i haven't had an argument with my partner. that's a first. coincidence?

i so wish i didn't give a fuck wether he looks at someone else or not, if he texts women or not. be secure that if he does it's his loss not mine. i wish i could either trust him or not give a damn. but no, i'm stuck in this dysfunctional way of thinking and feeling that causes me tremendous angst and make the life of my partner a nightmare. 

he stays because he loves me dearly and can't imagine living without me, but it's not easy living with me. i feel like i'm always on the verge of walking away, breaking up for nothing important that i turned into a gigantic drama. it has happened before. it's the old self fulfilling prophecy isn't it....

maybe one day he will cheat for real, since he already has the reputation and the lack of trust, there is nothing to loose. im half joking, half serious...

i think i should ask my psych to increase the abilify to increase the numbing effect on my jealousy i guess,  but i'm afraid of addiction and permanent side effects, such as td.

Lamictal and Birth control?,"hey friends,

i was recently prescribed lamictal. my psychiatrist said it would effect my nexplanon implant, so i got nervous to take it. now after online research it seems like nexplanon would actually be fine with lamictal (maybe making lamictal less effective, but not the other way around). i'm uneasy because of what my doctor told me, but everything else online is reassuring. i'm mainly reading that lamictal is fine with most birth controls, but if there are issues it may be with the pill not impacts or hormonal iuds.

months go by several mental break downs and mania episodes with extreme highs and lows and the therapist states he believes my husband may be bipolar. i see all of the signs. in college he abused xanax heavily . the doctor stated he could be imbalanced due to drug abuse in the past. is this something permanent? does it get better? he is on effexor and just started lamotrigine a few weeks ago. he also takes trazodone because he won’t sleep if not.

moving on : my daughter is getting to the point where she understands. she is four . she was upset the other day and “stated she wanted to hurt herself. that’s another heartbreak that i can’t even fit into this post. what do i even tell her about her daddy ? she told me that she knew daddy loved her but she wished daddy loved me and wished he was nice to me. i can see that it hurts her.

Weight Gain &amp; Triggered BPD Episode,"this is a rant... i just needed an outlet to do it.  don't feel obligated to reply, and i will advise in advice it could potentially be a trigger warning for anyone with an eating disorder. i don't have one, but i'm starting to think i'm developing one. 


it's been several months since i had a severe bpd episode where i went to my ""dark place""..aka, really bad head space.  lately though, i've noticed weight gain from being trapped indoors (i know...""everyone has gained weight"") but somehow hearing that doesn't really make me feel better. i've always had a little bit of a tummy, nothing that would make me feel extremely critical of myself. but the added 10 lbs i gained over the last 2 months has destroyed my self-esteem, which has affected my sex-life, my mood, and my relationship. i manage to go a few days dieting before slipping back into eating whatever i want, which is hugely disappointing and makes me feel like shit. ""why can't i just accomplish this one thing. it's only 10 lbs, it's not 100 lbs. you aren't grossly overweight, you just need to shed 10 lbs and you'll be back to only *kind of* having a tummy"". i'm really bothered by it, and i'm really trying to not let it affect my mood.  


having said that, last night my brother and i were talking about weight gain, and i asked him straight up ""do i look really, really, bad?"" and he said ""well, i wouldn't say two reallys, just one really"". and my mood just sunk to the bottom of the ocean.  for context, i'm 5'5"" and 145 lbs at 33 years old. my weight goes straight to belly fat. i was 135 before corona, and even then i was pretty critical of my tummy. now i'm begging to just get back to that point. 


i've started looking up phentermine or weight loss. even emailed a doctor about whether or not i would qualify for a ""short term, low dose"". like 2 weeks. just so i can run on a slight amphetamine like feel, have little to no appetite and just focus on doing things. even if it's exercise. many of us have probably been hypomanic before. that crazy good feeling where you're just getting shit done and high on life. i just need to be focused in that mode for a short while and shed some pounds. but of course, i know it's a shortcut. i know it has risks. i know that i'm not even technically obese or barely qualify as ""overweight"". i'm just a slightly fat american, who should be told ""go diet"".  but bpd is making me crazy depressed about it. i can't focus on anything other than shortcuts at this point, so i don't go back to my dark place like last night. it's the first time my girlfriend has seen me like that, and it's humiliating. it's not the dynamic that she signed up for or should have to deal with.  it's not attractive to see your boyfriend (10 years older than her) breaking down over being a bit fat. she deserves better than that. i can't have *another* failed relationship because i'm a fuckup with bpd baggage. no matter how many times i explain to her that i'm upset/depressed about something else (like my weight), it apparently is always perceived as me being moody or nasty with her. if i can shred this weight off.. i feel like it'll go a long way toward improving my self-esteem back to what it was pre-covid. 


my concerns: i'm on viibryd for depression, lamictal for mood stabilizer, and clonazepam for panic attacks/anxiety.   phentermine is a stimulant, like adderall (my 2nd choice, though i've never taken it or phentermine), and as such, any stimulant is going to spike my anxiety.  both my primary care physician and my psychiatrist think it would be f'n nuts to throw uppers and downers together.  of course having only my narrow point of view, i say ""to hell with it, they can balance each other out then"".  i get that it could be dangerous and that there are risks, but there's also significant risks if my mood/depression continue to decline and it ruins my relationship.  then i'll be in a really, really, bad place.

Advice on what medication to seek and the best way to go about getting it,"hello, hoping some people here have some experience with this and can help me out. i just got a job that is full time with benefits finally after losing health insurance early this year. im not gonna write a novel length backstory, this will probably end up long anyway cause thats how i write. i have been diagnosed with bpd, adhd, and depression. currently i am only taking adderall because it helps with the job. previously i was on a med cocktail of anti depressants (generic prozac i think), anti pyschotics(aprizol or something like that), and mood stablizers (lamotrigine). my current hope is to work this job the next couple years and learn to code, then switch into whatever i can find in that field when i am up to speed. gonna be patient about it. 

i basically want meds that turn me into a working robot. i dont want to freak out and make the people i care about sad anymore, i just want to disappear for the next couple of years and put my head down and learn. people sometimes complain that the meds theyre on make everything muted and dull- thats what i want for now. when i get a career going that i can make a decent living wage with i plan on really starting to address my underlying issues so maybe someday i can be functional enough to at least have stable close friendships. ive given up on the fact ill ever be able to make any romantic relationship work at this point, its not fair to the other person. 

i am hoping with the adderall counter acting any sleepiness the pills might cause i can find something that works for that. so my two questions are- any advice on meds that would fit in that category? lithium maybe? i dont care what it is (maybe not a benzo or anything addictive, not a great idea for me) ill take it if it stops me from feeling too much and losing control of myself.

the second question is if anyone has any advice on how to broach the subject to a doctor. i think telling them i want to be a robot zombie probably isnt going to work out so well, but maybe i dont know.

Being poor with mental issues feels like a death sentence,"i’ll preface this by saying, i’m not even in the us, where this stuff seems even worse, i’m in australia, where we allegedly have “good healthcare”. the whole mental health system just seems impossibly stacked against you if you’re poor. it already feels ridiculously tough to overcome these issues without that barrier, think in an ideal situation with all factors accounted for, there’d still be a chance you might not ever recover. but if you’re broke it just feels impossible.

to start with it’s just a catch-22 already. i can’t hold down a job because of my issues but i can fix my issues without money. that alone makes me feel like giving up. but then when you think about the sheer amount of money you have to throw at things that aren’t even helpful half the time, it basically just becomes a sick joke. i can’t count how many times i’ve paid to see a mental health “professional” that actually left me feeling more confused and hopeless. 

at the moment i’m on day three of suffering through absolutely awful ssri withdrawals because i couldn’t afford to get my meds renewed. my lexapro was on the same script as my lamictal. i’ve got a healthcare card that’s *supposed* to get me assistance with this stuff, but the pharmacy told me that lamictal “isn’t covered”. i don’t even understand that, how can a very common mood stabilisers, one of the primary forms of treatment for bipolar not be covered? it doesn’t even make sense to me. they told me it’d be $40 to get the script filled and that was for the generic version. i literally don’t have that money in my account so i just had to say no. it just seems so immoral.

and that’s not even to mention neither of those pills did anything for me. no intended effects, no side effects, no nothing. same story with every single medication i’ve taken in the past and i’ve been at this for years. makes me wonder if i’m even being treated for the right things. after all, depending on which psychiatrist you ask, i have major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, bipolar type 2, bpd, ptsd, c-ptsd, anorexia, substance abuse disorder and probably more i’m forgetting. seems like my diagnosis changes with the wind. i’ve seen 3 psychiatrists, all about a year apart because i just couldn’t afford to go more often than that or go back to the same one twice. first guy said it was just the depression with maybe some bpd. second said bpd with possible bipolar and ptsd or c-ptsd. third barely listened to me and said it’s definitely bipolar for purely genetic reasons and maybe some bpd traits. i’m just lost at this point and i can’t afford to keep going back to get clarity.

only reason i can get in to see a therapist now is because i’m on welfare and you can get a few free appointments. but even that’s no help because the guy they’ve sent me to, honestly, is dumber than a sack of bricks. i’m sure he means well, but he’s not gonna be able to help me. and i can’t afford anyone better. and even when i could, the cbt specialists, dbt specialists, emdr specialists, all seemed to be basically the same. none of it helped and again, it took up all my money just to get in the door so i didn’t have the luxury of trying again afterwards.

i just don’t get it. even my gp is throwing up her hands at this point saying there’s really no options left. i just feel untreatable, i mean i’m clearly already pretty treatment resistant as it is, so if i can’t even shop around until i get someone good or even feel confident i’ve got the right diagnosis, what hope is there? how does someone like me ever get better? i can’t even afford my goddamn meds anymore. this is just awful.",1630203372,FALSE,BPD,2021-08-29 02:16:12,"Being poor with mental issues feels like a death sentence i’ll preface this by saying, i’m not even in the us, where this stuff seems even worse, i’m in australia, where we allegedly have “good healthcare”. the whole mental health system just seems impossibly stacked against you if you’re poor. it already feels ridiculously tough to overcome these issues without that barrier, think in an ideal situation with all factors accounted for, there’d still be a chance you might not ever recover. but if you’re broke it just feels impossible.

Medication has ruined my sex life,"i (22m) have been on so many different types of medications at this point, about 5-6 different antidepressants, an antipsychotic and currently i’m on another antidepressant, lexapro and also lamotrigine for the first time. none of them seem to have done a damn thing for my mood but i keep taking them and trying new ones when i’m told to because surely they must do something, right? otherwise why would they exist? why would doctors keep saying i need them? i just want to feel better for once…

but they have completely ruined my sex life. i’ve never talked about it with anyone cause it embarrasses the fuck outta me, but i’ve been on medication the entire time i’ve been sexually active and as a result, i’ve never been able to orgasm once during sex. it’s fucking humiliating. 

i know this is a common problem for people on meds and even some people without meds and maybe i’m overreacting but it’s really fucking killed my sex life. i actively avoid sex now (not that it comes up much, i don’t really talk to anyone anymore either, prefer to be alone these days) because i know i’m probably not gonna be able to preform properly and then i’m gonna have to explain all this shit to the girl i’m with and run the risk of making her feel like it’s her or something or have her think i’m less of a man because i can’t reach orgasm. 

i already feel like i’ll never be able to have a relationship because of all my instability and how frustrating it must be for the people around me to see me go through the same fucking cycles over and over again, making me look completely weak to them because i’m just powerless to stop it. and this just adds a whole other layer to that. i can’t even have a healthy sex life. so i can’t do either side of the relationship, i can’t be attractive emotionally and i can’t be attractive physically, i’m just a fucking useless fuckup as far as relationships are concerned. i guess it’s a good thing i don’t have any people in my life at all and i don’t talk to anyone at least.

i really fucking hate what the medication has done to me, i feel like it’s ruining my body. but desperately i just want to stop feeling so shitty and unstable and suicidal all the time, otherwise what’s the point of being here? it just feels like my mental illness has just taken away any possibility i could’ve had for even remotely enjoying any aspect of life and every day i’m seeing less and less point to being here.",1624981702,FALSE,BPD,2021-06-29 15:48:22,"Medication has ruined my sex life i (22m) have been on so many different types of medications at this point, about 5-6 different antidepressants, an antipsychotic and currently i’m on another antidepressant, lexapro and also lamotrigine for the first time. none of them seem to have done a damn thing for my mood but i keep taking them and trying new ones when i’m told to because surely they must do something, right? otherwise why would they exist? why would doctors keep saying i need them? i just want to feel better for once…

i really fucking hate what the medication has done to me, i feel like it’s ruining my body. but desperately i just want to stop feeling so shitty and unstable and suicidal all the time, otherwise what’s the point of being here? it just feels like my mental illness has just taken away any possibility i could’ve had for even remotely enjoying any aspect of life and every day i’m seeing less and less point to being here.",medication ruined sex life 22m many different type medication point 56 different antidepressant antipsychotic currently i’m another antidepressant lexapro also lamotrigine first time none seem done damn thing mood keep taking trying new one i’m told surely must something right otherwise would exist would doctor keep saying need want feel better once… completely ruined sex life i’ve never talked anyone cause embarrasses fuck outta i’ve medication entire time i’ve sexually active result i’ve never able orgasm sex it’s fucking humiliating know common problem people med even people without med maybe i’m overreacting it’s really fucking killed sex life actively avoid sex come much don’t really talk anyone anymore either prefer alone day know i’m probably gonna able preform properly i’m gonna explain shit girl i’m run risk making feel like it’s something think i’m le man can’t reach orgasm already feel like i’ll never able relationship instability frustrating must people around see go fucking cycle making look completely weak i’m powerless stop add whole layer can’t even healthy sex life can’t either side relationship can’t attractive emotionally can’t attractive physically i’m fucking useless fuckup far relationship concerned guess it’s good thing don’t people life don’t talk anyone least really fucking hate medication done feel like it’s ruining body desperately want stop feeling shitty unstable suicidal time otherwise what’s point feel like mental illness taken away possibility could’ve even remotely enjoying aspect life every day i’m seeing le le point,0.9411345156367110,"['Escitalopram', 'Lamotrigine']","```json

"Out of the hospital, new diagnosis?, starting DBT soon, what happens next?","i am out of the local psychiatric hospital after a week of a mix of good and bad experiences. 

my medication has been altered-- i have been started on 125mg of trileptal, alongside my 300mg of lamictal, and 10mg of abilify. i am also on meclizine for my vertigo. i was taken off of xanax indefinitely. 

the care at the psychiatric hospital i went to wasn't exactly excellent, but by all means, was absolutely better than nothing at all. it gave me time to clear my head in a generally positive environment. there were times where the staff couldn't control the patients, but sometimes things like that happen. i cut it some slack when i felt uncomfortable. i've never been hospitalized before, so this was all new for me to experience. 

my new diagnosis may be bipolar ii with borderline personality instead of major depressive with bpd, but that isn't finalized yet. i just want a clear diagnosis at this point, so i can know what to read up on and learn about so i can find out how to better my own treatment and understand how the chemistry in my mind works. 

dbt is a very likely possibility at this point, and it is almost set that i will be starting it soon. i'm not sure what to expect because i have to do more research on it. i'm looking at it as a positive change in my life. i am looking forward to beginning it.

so what next? i know i'm not magically healed because i've been in a hospital for a few days, and that the road to recovery is going to be long and difficult, and i'll try my best not to relapse. it could happen, but i'm not planning on it. wish me luck with whatever the future holds.",1393908532,FALSE,BPD,2014-03-04 04:48:52,"Out of the hospital, new diagnosis?, starting DBT soon, what happens next? i am out of the local psychiatric hospital after a week of a mix of good and bad experiences.

Lamictal and Breakthrough Bleeding?,"i started taking lamictal a week ago, starting on 25mg and titrating up. this was after careful discussion with my psych (he wanted to put me on valproate originally) as i also need to be on a combined oral contraceptive to keep endometriosis at bay. i take yasmin and at the direction of my gynaecologist, back to back 3-4 packets then have a break. 

basically, this is probably the longest back to back i have done. i had my final exams at university and just couldn't deal with a period so i started a fifth packet of yasmin and planned to break after that. now i'm bleeding and having really bad period type cramps in my back but still have 8 days of this pill packet left. this started yesterday. i have never suffered breakthrough bleeding on yasmin before so wondering if this is to do with the lamictal?

Experiences on Wellbutrin,"hey everyone, i was diagnosed with bpd earlier this year and immediately started on lamictal. im currently up to 100 mg and i have truly noticed a huge difference in my life.  i don't overthink things as much as i was, i don't cry every 5 minuets while watching movies or tv, and i haven't felt as suicidal.  my moods don't change every 10 minuets.   although these changes have helped, i am still depressed and have absolutely no energy or motivation.  so my doc started me on wellbutrin 150mg xl, since i have not tolerated ssri's very well in the past, and my mom had a good experience on it.   i just wanted to document my first few days on it, and would really love to hear other peoples experiences on it, especially others with bpd. 

day 1:  felt very strange.  high almost.  a bit manic and irritable.   was able to sleep though.  mouth and stomach felt very strange 

day 2: had a bad stomach ache, didn't eat all day- just ate dinner.  extremely irritable.  really wanted to fight my mom lol. 

day 3:  had some energy in the morning.  felt very foggy- almost like i was getting sick.  kind of high.  terrible stomach ache- threw up.  ate something and felt worse.  the desire to eat is completely gone.  very weird considering i am a binge eater.   feeling pretty depressed, cried a few times today.  feeling extremely alone, irritable, angry and mean.  and worse than i did just on lamictal.  wanted to go out but didn't feel like being around people.

BPD and shifting goals,"hi pw/bpd, i hope you are well.

according to some research, 1 out of 3 people w/bpd are under medical treatment - mainly antipsychotics, antidepressants or mood stabilizers. i have tried a lot of various drugs, none of them worked.

i would like to hear your experience with mood stabilizers. i felt somewhat different while taking carbamazepine, it really stabilized me to the point where i had no agitation whatsoever. i felt very down all the time, on the scale of 1 to 10 my mood was always 2/10. i don't know if feeling depressed and suicidal 24/7 is any better than feelimg unstable, i doubt it. ok top of that, carbamazepine made me gain a lot of weight, i had 
acne breakouts, was constantly tired (used to get exhausted while taking a walk), also partial memory loss. in the end my psychiatrist took me off of it. i asked her to put me on lamotrigine instead but she refused. 

the instability is very tiring to say the least. while on the drug i was not ashamed of myself because my opinions and goals didn't change throughout the day as much. 

the main problem i face while dealing with bpd is inability to focus and lack of determination to end what i started. i have no long term goals, just shifting around. i am just wondering, is it possible to learn to be more stable and organized, if that is the right word? i want to be interested in something, want to be an expert in one field or another, now i am just jumping from one activity to another, not deeply interested in anything. can psychotherapy help?",1623567952,FALSE,BPD,2021-06-13 07:05:52,"BPD and shifting goals hi pw/bpd, i hope you are well.

"Medication, change, and hope","like many of you i've been in a decently large mess for a long time with my mental health. i was brought up with a bpd mum, bpd older sister, and bpd/bipolar 1 father, so you can imagine what kind of personality that fosters in a young kid (not helped by autistic traits which went undiagnosed due to the kinds of chaos that this family dynamic creates). i struggled with anxiety and panic from age 6, depression from 13, and manic/psychotic traits from time to time starting at 23; again, like probably most of you. try as i might i couldn't get control of things and ended up in hospital a few times as a result; eventually i got my psychiatrist to try me on medication despite there being little documented evidence of drugs being a good approach to the treatment of bpd. 

i posted here and there on reddit while trialing different drugs about the issues i encountered while doing so; allergic reactions, side effects, and the emotional baggage that came with it relating to my upbringing. sertraline, citalopram, duloxetine, propranolol, depakote, and reams of sleep drugs brought me no success over 5 years. eventually however i got to try lamotrigine, which i was interested in because apparently it was less sedating and had less weight gain.  

in short this drug is giving me my life back. my head is alert and busy, but calm and focused. there have been no urges to self harm whatsoever, which used to be a weekly occurrence. no flashes of blind rage. the anxiety i have is now contextualized and kept in proportion, and i can easily take control of my feelings when i need to so i can explore them without the safety implications there were before. i started volunteering with young people with mental health needs, so i could make some good come out of my experiences, and have received glowing praise from my colleagues in the process. a year ago i was too frightened to use the phone or be outside for any length of time; 6 months ago i wasn't showering, abusing drugs, and wasn't ever functional for more than a few days at a time, etc.

i've worked hard in addition to being medicated, but the point is that right when you feel like its time to write off this life, you might just run headlong into a solution. it always feels like forever when you're in the midst of a relapse or a stressful period, and very little makes that easier, but **you might only be a step away from big changes and not realise it**. so whatever's going on, however you're tackling it, however bleak the outlook, you need to keep the faith that eventually you will feel different as long as you work hard and persevere.

sorry about the ramble, but i've been thinking straight for the first time in over a decade, and i believe that if i managed to turn things around in the situation i found myself in, then most people can. prove to the old guard in the psych community that bpd isn't untreatable and we're not write-offs. prove to yourself that you've earned your right to a place in this life just as much as anyone else.",1514135575,FALSE,BPD,2017-12-24 17:12:55,"Medication, change, and hope like many of you i've been in a decently large mess for a long time with my mental health. i was brought up with a bpd mum, bpd older sister, and bpd/bipolar 1 father, so you can imagine what kind of personality that fosters in a young kid (not helped by autistic traits which went undiagnosed due to the kinds of chaos that this family dynamic creates). i struggled with anxiety and panic from age 6, depression from 13, and manic/psychotic traits from time to time starting at 23; again, like probably most of you. try as i might i couldn't get control of things and ended up in hospital a few times as a result; eventually i got my psychiatrist to try me on medication despite there being little documented evidence of drugs being a good approach to the treatment of bpd.

How do I fix this before I end up in a hospital psychotic or before I do some stupid shit? Really desperate for help.,"i'll try to be as short as possible, but it won't be easy. i really don't know who to talk to anymore about this one messy thing that kinda isn't my fault at all - but my reaction to it is totally bpdish and i need help. i'm rather calm right now. the problem persists for days and doesn't go away.

**tldr: some (not *that*) bad things have happened to me and i'm persistently fucked up. if something doesn't change, according to my previous experiences, i will end up seriously self-harming, become suicidal or go through psychotic outburst. i don't want any of that and i want to be ""normal"" and i am desperate for help.**

so, i have bpd and bipolar disorder. i currently take only lamictal (stabilizer) and wellbutrin (antidepressant). i go to weekly therapy for 2.5 years. a lot of it has improved. i used to be a complete wreck and now i don't even self-harm anymore (used to be main coping mechanism). i still have some other prominent bpd symptoms though, and i can see myself relapsing in other ways under certain circumstances.

here's the thing. i'm almost 24, 1st year of phd in theoretical physics. my thesis advisor is a total dick. bear with me: he has never said a single bad word to me, ever, but he hasn't given me any kind of feedback either, ever. so, with neutral feedback, of course, i figured i suck (after my first presentation). later i had a presentation and *i* thought it was good, so it probably really was at least okay because i am very self-critical. my ta said nothing.

later i hear from two completely separate, but both trustworthy people that my ta has been talking shit about me behind my back. he has literally told his younger students that i ""know nothing"" and similar things. he told them that he is very disappointed after my *last* presentation, which i figured was good. he hasn't told me that.

it hurt like hell. i have lost interest in studying this. ironically, now i am getting closer to ""knowing nothing"" because of my current behavior. i even think about quitting academia overall. bpd, you know. however, here's the problem. since i have heard this, i act like i'm depressed, although i know i am not going through a depressive episode, it's all a mere reaction to this. i sleep a lot, get up at 5pm (luckily it's holiday season here), lie in bed until i must piss, return and remain here until i fall asleep again. i think about my academic reputation a lot and i bash myself for not studying in the meantime.

i am becoming more and more suicidal. it started with thinking it'd be easier to not go through this bullshit, nothing pathological. now i'm at ""it wouldn't be a shame if i got killed accidentally"" and i'm afraid it's worsening because i'm actually starting to consider whether my cats and so would be okay if i killed myself, and then i kinda get afraid of the thought and feel like a dick because of them and make myself stop thinking about it. i don't want to do it, but this line of thought does lead to wanting to do it someday. i won't deceive myself, if this doesn't stop i'll wind up in a shitty place again.

my self-harming urges have intensified again. literally the only thing stopping me from cutting myself is not wanting to have scars. so i turn to alternative self-destructive methods: i smoke on an empty stomach while i drink lemonade (it hurts like hell bc i have stomach issues), i hit myself and i have almost completely stopped eating as a method of... dunno really, self-destructive coping. just trust me on this one, it's not an eating disorder issue, because i had no body issues before and now i feel really unattractive (43kg...) and even feeling unattractive, among with stupid, boring and forgotten by everybody has it's appeals though: more excuses to self-loathe and/or die.

finally, i have already seen what extreme stress can do to me from experience. it can literally make me psychotic for shorter periods, and it has, three times in the past. i was so glad when i stopped taking the antipsychotic after my last outbreak (which was induced by my extreme fear of failing when i start my phd - how ironic).

i really don't know what to do. all of this has been induced by my ta talking the things i'm most afraid of behind my back. i know it's ""not that much of a deal"" but i can't help it. right now, it's worsening every day. i have this feeling that it's really ""building up"" somewhere in me and i will breakdown. i don't know how. i hope i won't end up suicidal-with-a-plan and i also hope i won't end up paranoid and seeing things again... 

my pdoc thinks things will settle down. i feel worse from day to day and it doesn't go away. my partner also says i seem and act worse every day. i need help. i don't know where to turn to. my doctor is probably the best i could find and she *is* good, but she just thinks everything will get back on track eventually.

i feel like there is no time for ""eventually"". i feel i might explode tonight, tomorrow, or other time soon. has anybody been in a similar situation (doesn't have to be the same background, just behavior)? what do i do? what do i do if i become psychotic again? my ta will think i know nothing forever. i wish i wasn't here.

**tldr: some (not *that*) bad things have happened to me and i'm persistently fucked up. if something doesn't change, according to my previous experiences, i will end up seriously self-harming, become suicidal or go through psychotic outburst. i don't want any of that and i want to be ""normal"" and i am desperate for help.**

so, i have bpd and bipolar disorder. i currently take only lamictal (stabilizer) and wellbutrin (antidepressant). i go to weekly therapy for 2.5 years. a lot of it has improved. i used to be a complete wreck and now i don't even self-harm anymore (used to be main coping mechanism). i still have some other prominent bpd symptoms though, and i can see myself relapsing in other ways under certain circumstances.

Irritable at others happiness?,"looking for advice or support i guess. a little background: i live with one of my best friends. i recently moved out of a roomate situation that included my fp that went horribly bad and i was in a terrible spot for months with my bpd as well as just losing 2 of my closest friends in the explosion. 
i moved in with a good friend who i was excited to live with because she's a very positive person and motivating and it was something that i needed badly from my last living situation. 
here's the thing though, i had to take a break from the meds i was on (lamictal and pristiq and gabapentin) and am just now starting new ones after months (wellbutrin) and i've been struggling so hard with irritability. it makes me so frustrated with myself. everything makes me feel angry or cringe or just irritable. especially her joy though. like the things she likes a lot that she loves to talk about and wants to share with me just make me so much angrier. it's funny too because it's things that i like too. like she's a huge swiftie and this past week has been taylor swift obsession. i like taylor swift too, i have forever. but her joy about it makes me hate it. i just continuously find reasons in my head to why i don't like it, why it's bad, why it's cringe, why it shouldn't be that way, why she shouldn't like this or do this etc etc. it's like everything. even small things like using the wrong size tuperware for leftovers. it makes me so irritated, like i can't smile or even find a good response to her anymore because i just feel upset at her and the things she likes. it makes me so sad because i want to feel the same level of joy she's feeling. i want to understand how she can be so happy about these things. i just don't feel the joy and it frustrates me so much. it makes me more upset than the original upset because i can't stop being upset. 
i know wellbutrin isn't perscribed for bpd specifically usually but i struggle with depression really bad on top of my bpd and my psych and i decided we needed to tackle the depression first but i'm afraid i'm going to ruin my relationship with my friend if i don't get this under control. i don't know how to explain it to her, she's not familiar with bpd and it can be hard to talk to her because she is a talker and often doesn't create space for me to share things or have my say in things, which doesn't bother me because i don't like to share a lot, but i just can't communicate the struggles i face with bpd. she's the kind of person who always thinks that problems are related to things like student debt or money of the future and tries to convince me that i'd be better if i just didn't have the ""weight of debt"" but i don't care about my debt at all, i don't even plan on paying it back i just don't care about that but she's so convinced that i am. i'm just stuck feeling irritated and i don't know how to properly communicate with her. she has struggles with her family and life which she is not shy sharing which is good but it gets so old and she never gives me space to share my own struggles, which are a lot less surface level than hers. it sometimes just comes off as shallow to me when she talks about her struggles because she knows that i have sever cptsd from my family life and my own personal struggles and she just has no idea how deep mine are. it's like she's stressed about buying a duplex right now that she could rent out (she's 22 i'm 23) and like keeps talking about how she needs to get a credit card and her savings and her parents buying her grandma's house and such but then completely ignored my family life (both of my parents are currently homeless and jobless and i grew up homeless my whole life and am stable for the first time in my life right now) and i just don't know how to be accepting of her likes and life when i feel like this

Going medication free?,"i've been on medication for over 2 years to deal with the symptoms of bpd, and it's helped for sure. i started off with zoloft and seroquel, but changed those this year because of the side effect (weight gain and sexual dysfunction at low doses because i'm very sensitive to medication). i'm on lamotrigine and wellbutrin currently, but for the last while i've really been noticing the effect both or either one is having on my short-term memory. i'm forgetting things i never forgot before (putting away groceries, dinner i'm in the middle of prepping). it's just really a crappy thing to have to deal with.

Tapering medication,"i am currently working towards tapering off my medications (ssri and mood stabilizer). 

i have been on various forms of ssris and snris for the past ten years with little results, even though various doctors have been convinced that i have improved on them. i never felt like they did much past the first few weeks of positive adjustment (eg. waking up earlier in the morning). 

one of the main reasons i haven’t stopped taking medication is because my doctors say they see improvement, they don’t want to taper, and my own fear of what will happen if i get off them and realize that i do want to be back on a medication and i have to wait 6-8 weeks to get back to a therapeutic dosage. 

after having an unusual (and scary) experience with geodon and excessive weight gain on lamictal. i have decided to finally taper off of medication. 

i am currently 6 months into dbt, working with a therapist i enjoy, and a bpd diagnosis.

Confusing phase in life,"hi guys, i'm a 19 year old male and i've been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and possibly bipolar disorder type ii. however, i understand this is not the place to ask for a diagnosis, but i'm am almost certain i have some form of a borderline personality disorder if not full borderline personality disorder. i have multiple personas that i've noticed - the confident and cool personality, the anxious and nervous personality, the angry personality (very common). i'm slowly realizing what's causing me to switch between these things - emotional dysregulation, misunderstandings in my relationship with others, anger at my school work and work in general, anger at my family, the slightest criticism from anyone, people who don't have common interests as i do, people who try to use me, anger at those i love, anxiety from school work, fear of being abandoned and alone. so lots of angers yeah.

i've tried multiple medication - lexapro (made me suicidal), ativan (makes me relaxed but extremely worsens my mood swings after it wears out and gives me muscle twitches), adderall (increased anxiety, was originally for my ""adhd""-like symptoms), lamictal (made my skin itchy and increased my anxiety, was used for the bipolar disorder diagnosis). as i've noticed, medication has not been working well for me and it seems to have made my situation worse. i don't do drugs either. i hate drugs with a passion. my dad's side of the family has anger issues and my mom's side has anxiety issues. 

i'm a university student and i have a hard time maintaining my friendships. i hate the school i'm at because it is way too damn difficult for me. i get angry at people for the smallest reasons and it's driving me nuts. i stay at home when my personality changes and i game and recently i've been trying so hard to stay away from that. gaming helps me get out of whatever i'm going but makes it worse in the end. it increases my anxiety and disconnects me from reality. i hate to say this but i masturbate way too often because it helps me calm down but it also worsens the situation in the end. i've been recently trying to stop that as well. 

my situation has continuously been getting worse and i really need help. i've been to way too many psychiatrists and they constantly misdiagnose me. i've been studying religion and trying to get my shit together. listening to parents. listening to people. trying to figure out what to do in this god damn world. i just don't get it. it's like the harder i try the worser i make the situation. been reading the 48 laws of power by robert greene. been reading how to win friends and influence people by dale carnegie. been reading the power of now by eckhart tolle. nothing for crying out loud is helping me. i'm so fucking frustrated. not even my parents are dealing with my shit anymore. i constantly find myself alone in my room. and my anger towards those i love is reaching its peak. it's fucking pathetic i know. it's sad really. i just don't get what i need to do because for crying out loud i took psychology in high school and we learned this term called learned hopelessness. i keep wanting to drop out of college and i keep losing friends and i keep getting angry at them and thrashing them out of my life. this is how i lost my first and only girlfriend (long-distance because lots of bpd people nowadays seem to be getting into long-distance relationships and i don't seem to be an exception).

"Birth control, rage and Abilify","for the women on here, what has your experience been like with bpd and hormonal birth control? and for those who have had children, what was pregnancy like?

after spending a significant amount of time on and off of multiple hormonal contraceptives (a game i like to refer to as musical birth control), i’ve realized that hormones just fuck with me. there’s a significant amount of evidence that some even directly compete with medications like lamictal (the mood stabilizer i’ve been on for 5+ years now).

i went from being stable for the past 6 months to unstable and experiencing symptoms again after starting the nuvaring a couple of months ago. i felt a little off kilter but noticed something was really off when i felt enraged for 5 hours last weekend. the episodes have been popping up more and more lately so yesterday i asked my psychiatrist for help.

they prescribed me an as needed dose of abilify, which i’m optimist about. the rage episodes are pretty rare and i just keep to myself when i’m ramping up and use my dbt skills to try to come back down. they don’t help as much as i’d need them to which is what prompted me to ask for a different solution.

I made a mistake... POTENTIALLY TRIGGERING!!!,"26y.o. male, bpd with schizophrenic elements...i should start by saying it's been an unstable four months or so. november was extremely depressing, and i was thinking about returning to my former addiction of burning myself. wrecked my car early december, and had to quit my job because of it... i spent much of december drinking obscene amounts of alcohol every night, and most of the time was irrationally angry or else enraged at the most insignificant events, things that don't deserve a second chance. sought help from my psychiatrist i hadn't seen in a while, unfortunately haven't been able to see a therapist due to insurance change first of the year. got a new job first week of january, and pretty much worked everyday (some 60 hours a week) for the next six weeks, which is good for a guy like me, keeps me busy and occupied.

in hindsight, i was abnormally happy, more than what events dictated. a bit more than ten days ago, things turned sour, and by wednesday i was suicidally depressed (for the umpteenth time in my life, goes back to early childhood for me).

i guess this would be a good time to mention my medication regiment, 450 mg wellbutrin xl (since ssris do little for me), 30 mg mirtazapine, as a supplement to the wellbutrin and a sleep aid, and 100 mg lamictal, to curb the edges.... guess they weren't working as well as i thought....

thursday night, after once again getting absurdly drunk. i downed what i had left of the mirtazapine... maybe 400-500 mg... went to bed slept maybe 6 hours. all next day at work i could not stop shaking. others noticed. and my thoughts got worse... that night (friday) i again got extremely drunk, and tried to end it through overdose, downing the rest of my meds (will refrain from dosages, i'd rather not give any ideas...) some 5 minutes later, i became extremely disoriented and dizzy, and went to my balcony to smoke a cigarette, where i lost all cognitive muscle function. i don't remember parts, other than beating my head against the walls, eventually not able to stand.... puked maybe half of what i had taken up, and gave in to the idea i was gonna live, (of course, extreme paranoia everyone in my life already knew, even if they couldn't, but that's another realm of thought...).... i tried opening to door to crawl to my bed, but couldn't figure out how to work the handle, and eventually as my sight dimmed, couldn't even find it. so i resided to sleep on the balcony in the cold.... i woke a few hours later, and my sight and a bit of muscle function had returned, so i crawled uneasily to my bed, and before passing out, puked beside my bed one last time.

i woke up saturday morning around 7am (i think i passed out in my bed about 2:30 am but it's hard to tell really, obvious reasons) noticed where i had puked next to my bed, and a good bit was blood. had to be since i hadn't eaten anything red colored for a couple days. i tried sitting up and going to puke again (i was extremely nauseous) and i fell to the floor, having to crawl to my toilet, so i could dry heave for about 20 minutes.... pretty much had to stay bed ridden, world spinning, till around 5pm when thinks cleared up enough i could walk.

it's sunday evening now, i have cuts and scrapes all over my head and arms (i've taken proper care of them after finding them saturday evening), and so far, this post is the first anyone has heard about this very regretful night of mine... fortunately, i feel rather even tempered now, with a slightly positive outlook on the future, as i remember what i had set out to do as of this year to become a better, more benevolent man... a cause i will pick up again starting with seeing my psychiatrist as soon as possible, and seeking a therapist immediately... it's obvious to me, that if going to help people like i want to, i need to help myself first, and that starts by learning skills and tools to better overcome my problems.

this event wasn't my first attempt, but i hope it is the last, and i will do everything i can to make sure it is. my advise to anyone reading this, i failed to reach out in my darkest hour... don't make that mistake, do not be afraid to tell someone you need help. also, do not let your problems or diagnosis define you, that's merely a label, and any good therapist treats the symptoms, not the diagnosis. if you want to be depressed, you will be depressed... unfortunately, if you want to be happy, you have to earn it. do everything you can everyday to help yourself be a better person, help others, and always see where you want to be this time next year, and do something everyday that gets you closer to that goal.


good luck my brothers and sisters.

POTENTIALLY TRIGGERING!!! 26y.o. male, bpd with schizophrenic elements...i should start by saying it's been an unstable four months or so. november was extremely depressing, and i was thinking about returning to my former addiction of burning myself. wrecked my car early december, and had to quit my job because of it... i spent much of december drinking obscene amounts of alcohol every night, and most of the time was irrationally angry or else enraged at the most insignificant events, things that don't deserve a second chance. sought help from my psychiatrist i hadn't seen in a while, unfortunately haven't been able to see a therapist due to insurance change first of the year. got a new job first week of january, and pretty much worked everyday (some 60 hours a week) for the next six weeks, which is good for a guy like me, keeps me busy and occupied.

in hindsight, i was abnormally happy, more than what events dictated. a bit more than ten days ago, things turned sour, and by wednesday i was suicidally depressed (for the umpteenth time in my life, goes back to early childhood for me).

i guess this would be a good time to mention my medication regiment, 450 mg wellbutrin xl (since ssris do little for me), 30 mg mirtazapine, as a supplement to the wellbutrin and a sleep aid, and 100 mg lamictal, to curb the edges.... guess they weren't working as well as i thought....

Advice on medication?,"over the past two years, i’ve been seen by two different medication prescribers because they’re the only ones at the facility my (absolute favorite) therapist is at.

i’m getting frustrated and hopeless. i feel hollow. depressed. i have for years, i’m just better at pretending now. no matter how good life is going, i can’t get myself to get out of this depression. i consistently loop back to suicidal ideation and have been in that headspace for a few weeks now. my irrational thoughts convince me that friends don’t want to see me, don’t care about me, etc. even though i have a job i love, i sometimes wake up and consider just skipping work. i just don’t see the point of anything, and i know that managed medication can help, but it feels like no matter how hard i try, they won’t listen.

"Feeling abnormally more suicidal due to nightmares, please help me.","i keep having recurring nightmares of disturbingly personal/traumatic situations, they will repeat endlessly in my head until i wake up drenched in sweat and feeling like i’ve got nothing left of me in my body. it ruins my sleep and makes me go into a funk where i am constantly being told in my head to kill myself, like over and over and over again throughout the next two to three days. last night i kept dreaming that i would brush my hair until i bled and i just would keep going and going, it was like i was being soothed by creating pain to my body. (i am ocd w/csp diagnosed too so that doesn’t help my situation with killing the unwanted thoughts including self harm)

i’ve always been at peace with the thought of death and i desire it a lot of days just because i so badly want to just check out from my mind forever. i had a failed attempt a few years ago which made me realize that i didn’t want to make my wonderful mom suffer so i haven’t had the actual guts to attempt again. but currently at this point, i can’t deal with my intrusive thoughts overtaking me anymore and i’ve been closer than usual to wanting to badly hurt myself which is terrifying me. 

i want to change before i do end up killing myself because i deserve to live happy, i’m tired of therapists listening to me talk for an hour and then kick me to the curb without any resolution or actual therapy overtime. i want to go to intensive therapy (like a rehab center) because i feel like a prisoner in my own mind, unfortunately no one close to me believes i am that bad off or maybe they’re in denial. 

i’m aware of the fact that my thoughts are something that i used to be able to control and it frustrates me so badly that i can’t go back to that stronger side of myself and i’m lost on how to get even get there in the first place. 

i’ve had to call out my semi-new job two days in a row now because of how terrible i’ve been feeling and of course that’s also making me feel worse because i am probably going to get fired. i have no idea what’s going on and my anxiety attacks and overall thoughts about life are weird too, i’ve vomited and been in a constant state of nauseousness from my anxiety, also i am having the hardest time breathing/sore chest. usually i’m on the floor hyperventilating and bawling my eyes out with muscle spasms when i have these attacks. i don’t feel like i am in control of myself anymore and i need advice. i’m not sure what advice i’m even seeking but i just know i need help and i have no friends to help me. i have a good life at the moment and i am sabotaging myself to make me hate it, i’m 22 years old and i’m not taking advantage of it at all, i’m a fucking hermit who wears fake tan so i don’t look like nosferatu. 

i’ve been prozac, adderall, xanax, and lamotrigine since december 2017, i feel like it’s not doing shit and it’s more of a placebo pill at this point. i am a daily weed smoker also, i am prescribed hydrocodone on top of all my other meds due to me breaking my back at 14 but i refuse to take them so i replace the pain management with weed. 

sorry for any typos and i’m sorry if i sound like i’m complaining, i’m just lost and run down, i know suicide is selfish decision. i’m mostly afraid of what i am actually capable of when my bpd really comes out to play (like now), i always irrationally make decisions and want to make myself suffer.

"Hi, I'm new here.","hi! 

i'm a 26-year-old woman in nyc who received a long-overdue bpd diagnosis this summer. i've long believed my mother to have bpd, and probably her mother before her. it's just affective instability all the way down in my family. 

i'm currently taking two low-grade mood stabilizers (lamotrigine and gabapentin) and they appear to really help me ride out my emotional cycles. i started dbt this summer, but changed jobs and changed insurance, and was no longer able to see that therapist due to money. i have gone through the ringer with insurance trying to find someone, and in the process encountered a therapist who laughed at a story i told her and when i said i thought it was inappropriate said ""this is what borderlines do. they exaggerate and get angry at you,"" prompting me to walk out of the session. i have plans to see my former therapist next year when my deductible resets and i will just use fsa for that. tl;dr: i have yet to really start a dbt program. 

i do not speak to either of my parents, but i have a stable career and friendships, and live with my boyfriend of two years. my relationship is where most of my symptoms arise, mostly in the form of truly irrational jealousy and a compulsive (but controlled) need for validation in the form of sex. i have had some of the worst episodes of my life because of fabricated reasons to feel jealous or disrespected. 

i worry about emotionally dumping on my friends when i do have emotional episodes. i have great female friends who know about my diagnosis and understand how my mind works and have genuinely helpful advice when my rational mind has just left me in the dust. 

when i do get upset and worked up about some perceived rejection or potential for abandonment, i can not really get through the cycle without talking about what's on my mind. while my boyfriend is very understanding and loving, i don't feel like it's in either of our best interests for me to vocalize all of my most incomprehensible fears. i express them to my friends sometimes, but i don't want to impose on their lives in that way. 

i am wondering if it is appropriate for me to use this subreddit as a place to write out what has upset me and how i'm handling the feelings. i know this is an essential part of dbt, and look forward to handling that type of stuff with my therapist next year. but for now, i am frustrated that my brain is held hostage until i vocalize my ridiculous, irrational fears, and worry about consequences of me being ""too bpd"" all over the people in my life.

Lamictal: i think im going insane and i need help,"i have been in treatment for bpd, ed and depression for some time and during the last few years i have been treated with various medications. over the last year i didnt have my doctor (for a number of reasons) so i sticked to the therapy i got when i left the hospital-300mg of wellbutrin(bupropion) and occasionaly clonazepam. 
i cant really say i've been stable and/or happy but i was able to function. about a month and a half ago i went to the psychiatrist who used to treat me in high school and he told me to take lamictal(lamotrigin). i did everything by the rules, slowly increasing the dose in four weeks until i got to 100mg.
now, im going insane. i have never been this unstable. its like there are thousands of different moods that keep changing all the time and really quickly. i start doing one thing but in a minute i feel like doing something completely different, but i dont finish that either. and its not just a mood, its like a whole..set, like i have hundreds of persons in my head that just keep changing. i put up with it during the day with occasional depressive episodes (and later i think that i was silly to depress over whatever i was being depressed about), going from extremely nice to extremly irritable, but then i cant really sleep so im awake for 30hrs or so, and in those last few hours i just... fall apart. break. i cant take it anymore. it literally feels like im going insane. my mood cant stay the same for half an hour, and sometimes even not more than few minutes.

can lamotrigine cause all of this? this hasnt happened ever before i started taking it. the funny thing is is that it should have opposite efect,right? make me stable and stuff. 

i think its getting pretty bad. i self harmed after years of being sh-free.

I feel more functional and “normal” than I ever have,"it’ll be a long one so here we go..

in the last 3 months i have been on lamotrigine. i had to channel my bpd brain when i went to the doctors and coerced them in to writing me up a script. i told them that i had taken it previously (i hadn’t been to the doctors in that area for a long time and i told him that i had it ages ago but stopped taking it because i felt better). so i was super convincing and used a lot of terminology.

while this isn’t an orthodox way to get medication, i had really no other option as i had tried about 10 different medications since being 16 (now 26) and periods of time where i hadn’t taken anything.

i had been diagnosed earlier in the year with bpd and bp2, which i had a feeling this was the case for awhile now... so all the medications over the years just kicked me more out of balance and i’ve had to ensure many withdrawals, sleepless nights, restless legs... i felt defeated. on the anti-psychotic front, i had seroquel for some time and i gained so much weight. my eating disorder thought patterns came back although i kept myself accountable and gave myself the firm no. i eat healthy and exercise sometimes/rarely so part my fault and part the medication ... moving on ...

i spent a lot of time doing extensive research and i thought lamotrigine made the most sense to try.

i started on 25mg and have slowly titrated to the therapeutic dose of 200mg. the most recent script i got was about a month ago for 100mg so i’ve been taking two of those in the morning.

i got some headaches and lost my appetite in the beginning and each time i titrated i had headaches.

i went to a psychologist a few weeks ago, after i had quit my job of 2 years as i had got another one (better pay, better team and new role). so that blew my anxiety right out of the water. we spoke about the wise mind and emotional regulation and she wants to see me again.

my world is now in colour. i feel things. i feel happy! my body isn’t sore (potential fibromyalgia but i could put it down to depression). i am sensitive to sad things i hear about or see on television. i have always been sensitive as a person, but i had felt numb for the longest time or my bpd amplified it and triggered rage hypomania so it was nice to actually feel something authentic, goosebumps and tears in my eyes from something i felt. i rarely cry! but these are empathetic and heartfelt moments for me, which i haven’t had since i was a teenager. i am a lot more understanding and i can have a conversation without feeling defensive or worried about what people think of me.

despite lying to the doctors which i don’t really feel bad about, it was the best decision i have made.

i just wanted to share this with the community in case anybody is in the same boat as me. do your research and weigh up the pros and cons. this is not advice, this is my story so far and for somebody who thought there was no hope and i would be this mess of a borderline and bipolar person clutching straws to keep her life together. it’s so much easier now.

Just diagnosed and not taking it well,"hi everyone. i feel like i need to say these things to someone who understands, so thank you for taking the time to read this. and sorry if this is a little disorganized. my family and friends have abandoned me at this point (i don't know if this is real or imaginary). i'm 27f and i've been sick my whole life. sexually abused starting at 4 years old. emotional abuse my entire childhood. i started self-abuse when i was seven years old, started compulsively cutting at 10 or 11. technically i qualify for both bipolar and bpd if going by the book. i have been diagnosed with bipolar 2 by my therapist. for many years i have had suspicions that i have bpd as well as bipolar. i don't quite understand how someone could have both, but in my case, i definitely have more going on than bipolar but i also don't have the daily mood changes that are supposed to come along with bpd. i have hypomania and severe depression that last months. i also have periods in between when i am normal and stable, and i've read that bpd doesn't have this. i definitely have the fear of abandonment and paranoia. when i'm stable, i am not easily offended by anything, i am independent and not incredibly needy like i am when i break down. basically, not every little thing in life gets me down and i'm a normal functioning person. so anyway, i saw my first ever psychiatrist a couple of days ago. i decided to go to her because i thought it would be better than getting meds from my general practitioner. i broke down several months ago and finally, after so many years of resisting, decided i needed to get on meds. my general practitioner gave me what i asked for. after research i decided i wanted to try wellbutrin and lamictal. started the wellbutrin first and went into what i called rapid cycling (psychiatrist doesn't call it this). i also hurt myself for the first time in 6 years. i didn't cut because i couldn't find anything sharp enough. i used an eraser on my wrist and rubbed my skin off until it was bleeding. several months later i am still putting makeup on it because it still looks fresh. started lamictal after that and it got better, the meds were helping, but i may have been in a hypomanic episode for three months, which would have been the longest period of time that i've had that. i filled out the paperwork for the psychiatrist and the first thing the psychiatrist said to me when i sat down was that i didn't have bipolar disorder. my heart sank because i knew what she was thinking. i had finally just accepted that i have bipolar disorder, this is something i will forever live with and i might as well do the best i can. several minutes later i asked her if it was bpd that she thought i had. she confirmed my fears and said yes. we talked for an hour and a half and near the end she changed her mind and said that she has to wait until next session to officially diagnose me because she suspects that i might have both bd and bpd. she is also convinced i have ptsd. i realized something that i don't like. this whole time i've been seeing my therapist, i have unconsciously manipulated her into coming to the conclusion that i have bipolar disorder and that's my problem, nothing else. but i was 100% honest with the psychiatrist for some reason. correct me if i'm wrong, but this unconscious manipulation sounds like things i've read about bpd. i liked this psychiatrist, i thought she was extremely intelligent and spot on about everything. as i was finishing up and checking out i felt okay, i thought i was fine. as soon as i got to my car i just broke down. i called my sister (who also has the same mental health issues that i do, she just doesn't see anyone). i told her everything that had happened. when my husband got home from work i told him everything. i was a mess all day. i'm back to the depression. i talked to my sister again on the phone later and told her that i was suicidal and that i just couldn't handle this right now. she didn't really say anything but she listened. my husband was the exact same way, he listened but didn't hug me or say anything to me. this was all on july 3rd. my sister was supposed to spend the day with me on the 4th but cancelled. she made up an excuse but i know it's just because she couldn't handle being around me. her excuse was something that wouldn't have prevented her from being with me that day when she knew i really needed support. my husband is avoiding this and refuses to do research to better understand what is happening to me. i've been trying to think of how to kill myself and i already hurt myself again. i say all this and i feel that i am being rational but at the same time, i know that there is a chance i'm actually being irrational and not seeing the situation clearly. i just don't know how i'm supposed to continue living like this. i'm upset and i can't live with the fact that i might suffer from both these things. every minute of the day i'm trying to decide what to do with myself because i'm stuck and don't get out of bed. my therapist is on maternity leave so i can't see her for a session. i feel like i'm supposed to accept that i need to deal with this alone and not rely on anyone else. i don't blame anyone for avoiding me, i know it must be extremely difficult. sorry for all the negativity, but thanks for listening anyway.

convinced i have ptsd. i realized something that i don't like. this whole time i've been seeing my therapist, i have unconsciously manipulated her into coming to the conclusion that i have bipolar disorder and that's my problem, nothing else. but i was 100% honest with the psychiatrist for some reason. correct me if i'm wrong, but this unconscious manipulation sounds like things i've read about bpd. i liked this psychiatrist, i thought she was extremely intelligent and spot on about everything. as i was finishing up and checking out i felt okay, i thought i was fine. as soon as i got to my car i just broke down. i called my sister (who also has the same mental health issues that i do, she just doesn't see anyone). i told her everything that had happened. when my husband got home from work i told him everything. i was a mess all day. i'm back to the depression. i talked to my sister again on the phone later and told her that i was suicidal and that i just couldn't handle this right now. she didn't really say anything but she listened. my husband was the exact same way, he listened but didn't hug me or say anything to me. this was all on july 3rd. my sister was supposed to spend the day with me on the 4th but cancelled. she made up an excuse but i know it's just because she couldn't handle being around me. her excuse was something that wouldn't have prevented her from being with me that day when she knew i really needed support. my husband is avoiding this and refuses to do research to better understand what is happening to me. i've been trying to think of how to kill myself and i already hurt myself again. i say all this and i feel that i am being rational but at the same time, i know that there is a chance i'm actually being irrational and not seeing the situation clearly. i just don't know how i'm supposed to continue living like this. i'm upset and i can't live with the fact that i might suffer from both these things. every minute of the day i'm trying to decide what to do with myself because i'm stuck and don't get out of bed. my therapist is on maternity leave so i can't see her for a session. i feel like i'm supposed to accept that i need to deal with this alone and not rely on anyone else. i don't blame anyone for avoiding me, i know it must be extremely difficult. sorry for all the negativity, but thanks for listening anyway.

Inquired with my pysch about Lamictal plus my life in general,"tw: suicidal ideation

hello all, 
i hope this reaches you all as well as possible. i was diagnosed with bpd in 2016, and my life since then has been a roller coaster between my own inner turmoil and a lot of outside life events. i have not been in a good place for awhile. i was with my soon to be ex (we are divorcing soon) for ten years and she was always a stabilizing force in my life (thank god for that), but once that relationship was gone, i had went back to maladaptive coping mechanisms to alter my moods. a lot of ssris and snris have either increased my anxiety and have not been effective for me. in the past, lamictal has proven effective for me and this past week, i had some very intense feelings, feelings of suicidal ideation and a situation happened where i just couldn't cope and i couldn't eat that entire day. 

i'm alive, i'm safe, and i'm here. but the situation made me realize that i'm using others to stabilize my moods and i get angry when they're not available to do so. i'm trying to give myself grace here because my ex and i were very codependent and we stabilized each other's moods for each other, and without her constantly by my by side, that need is greater than ever. plus, the grief that divorce brings, is a whole mood just in general. 

i reached out to my psychiatrist today about going on the lamictal and hope to hear from her soon (she's great and very responsive), plus, i have an amazing therapist (whom i have two sessions with in the next week) that took me off my suicidal thought ledge the other day and helped me foster the will to live that day and these last few days. 

i'm reaching out here to keep myself accountable and to follow through in the steps of my recovery because i know it will and can be possible. i know meds are not the only answer but a tool in the great big toolbox of bpd recovery. i really appreciate seeing all your posts because it makes me feel less alone, thank you and i love you all for listening.",1600015336,FALSE,BPD,2020-09-13 16:42:16,"Inquired with my pysch about Lamictal plus my life in general tw: suicidal ideation

The SMALLEST fucking dose of pretty much any psych med turns me into a dissociative robot,"idk what the issue is here? it’s all or nothing with me, even when it comes to meds. i can take 25mg of lexapro and once i feel it come on i’ll just sit and stare at a wall or my lap or my feet or just zone out on the internet (not really paying attention to anything) for like an hour. it’s like it numbs me and i suddenly don’t want anything. it makes it even harder to discern what i want, and the voice in my head is hushed to a whisper. it truly makes me an empty husk, a robot that only moves when someone tells it what to do. same story with wellbutrin and lamictal on the smallest possible dose just a single dose in. 

it intensifies my feelings of emptiness, depersonalization and derealization, and just dehumanizes me. it makes me feel even less like a fucking person. i don’t feel like a fucking person goddamnit why don’t i have an ego and meds make this central problem of mineso much more pronounced.

i'm a 22 year old male, new york city, a recovering addict (adderall mostly), queer, bachelor's in psychology and sociology from an ok institution i guess, diagnosed with bpd at 18, on lamictal, valium (as needed), and zendedi (which is like adderall but i take such a low, controlled dose and i let my sister hold them so i can't abuse them), all prescribed legally by my doctor.

all my life i've been able to hold down steady jobs while pulling good grades in both high school and college. i had a breakdown in college, though, resulting in hypothermia that led to frostbite that led to almost losing my toes (thank god for whatever modern medicine helped... i was knocked out in the hospital for weeks), and that was when my parents kinda started to take me seriously.

anyway, after i graduated college in december 2016, i came home and started working at a supermarket. i've worked at them before, mind you, but i couldn't handle it... i don't know why. i had to quit after a week because i couldn't stand having to run into the bathroom to cry multiple times a shift. i got another job working at a student loan company and it was good money, but i had to quit because my mood swings were getting out of control. i got another job working in marketing, but it turned out not to be what i expected and my boss would make fun of mental illness almost daily. i walked out one day, emailed a resignation notice, got my last check in months... and i've now been unemployed for about four months.

i can't work. i've started abusing drugs again, i'm about three weeks clean but i'm so scared i'll go back. i've developed what i think is an eating disorder, i take speed so i'm not hungry and laxatives, i weigh about 100 pounds (i'm only 5'6"" though), when people tell me i look like skin and bones i just want to be thinner, maybe then someone will love me, all my ex boyfriends have told me i'm too crazy for them, the three people in my life who've been my closest friends have either been locked up for years for charges unrelated to drugs/mental illness but i feel responsible, i could have helped, or the other two, they told me i was too much for them as well... my last college roommate, my best friend, the day after i graduated and moved out cursed me out and told me never to speak to her again.

How were you diagnosed and what do you experience daily?,"hello all! 26f. i am new to this sub.  
i wanted to hear some experiences about something that has been happening to me for a while now and didn’t know where else to turn. i was diagnosed with panic and anxiety about 4 years ago. at that point, i tried different medications (antidepressants) and found that some were helpful. the most helpful ones though were lamictal and another mood stabilizer but had to go off it because anxiety would come back. i was surprised to know this as i thought this was for bipolar individuals.

skip forward to this year, covid basically fucked me up mentally and i had to switch out off mirtazapine. by the last days i was on it i felt hopeless, with suicidal thoughts, and like my thoughts were very rapid, which was weird because i am not usually like that. the next med i tried was fluvox for about 2 months, and this is where the mood swings started. i was literally happy one moment and five seconds later i was crying because my life was too difficult and wanted to kill myself (i do not, but this is a scary obsessive thought that keeps reappearing lately). i then tried lexapro (the med i am currently on), and i have to say i feel like shit. 

in the last year since i’ve been on this med, i have had the craziest mood swings ever. thing is, i was never like this before (at least not to this degree). but basically at least 3-4x a week, i wake up very happy, motivated, clean my entire apartment, and all of the sudden at work, i go through an alternation of negative and positive thoughts: “my life makes no sense, i love working here, my life is so meaningless i hate my job, i’m excited to go to the gym today, i am going crazy - i want to end this, okay i’m fine”. wtf? all in a span of 1 hour.

at this point, i have talked endlessly with my psychiatrist and she keeps mentioning that she thinks i have bpd. in my mind, i don’t truly know because i was not like this before, this started showing up mid last year. and i’m concerned that it may be the medications that have fucked me up in a way? in conclusion, i’d like to ask you guys how you were diagnosed and if you have gone through any experience like the one i described with mood difficulties. thanks!",1636485455,FALSE,BPD,2021-11-09 19:17:35,"How were you diagnosed and what do you experience daily? hello all! 26f. i am new to this sub.

so i called him today hoping to get advice or a different prescription and he gave me the wrong fucking number. i googled him to find the right one and this guy has like 6 phone numbers and then it came up that he has gross negligence on his record from just last year, and he has a shit ton of reviews saying how unreliable and sketchy he is.

i finally found the right number and the receptionist sounded like she didn't give a shit then accused me of not taking my medications only to find out he wrote down another prescription for lamictal but forgot to call it in?? i called my pharmacy and they said there was no prescription for lamictal. 

so then the receptionist said she'd forward my message to him and hed call me back today. well he didn't and now i have to wait all weekend.

Sexual Side Effects of Mood Stabilizers/SSRIs (Mainly for men) [NSFW I think],"i think the rules of this sub require not to mention specific medications or give/ask for actual medical advice, so i won't.

so i'm currently taking a mood stabilizer given to epileptic patients, but my psych says it's popular for treating bpd. he also prescribed me an ssri (the only one i haven't tried yet - i've been on all of them when my diagnosis was major depression). i've been taking them for about two weeks now. my symptoms have decreased dramatically, so i have no plans to stop taking them. but there's a problem.

i've recently begun dating a really amazing guy. we've been on four dates, and have had sex twice. he's kind of an impulsive dude as well (he doesn't have bpd), so we drink a lot and roam around our big city and just enjoy each others' presence. he makes me happy. he's also a very serious guy, so if my symptoms flare and i'm thinking with my emotions, not my mind, he kind of straightens me out.

anyway, when we were in bed two nights ago, i couldn't ""get it up."" he would usually be the one penetrating me, but after i couldn't get excited, we just laid down and cuddled and talked. that was cool and all, but i just got so frustrated. normally my libido is sky high as a 20-something gay male, and it still is, but it's so hard for me to get excited now. even when i want to pleasure myself alone, it takes a lot for me to get excited, and even longer to reach climax. so i can climax, but when i'm with another person, i just can't.

and i don't know about you guys, but that's so stupidly embarrassing. he kept on asking me ""are you sure you're enjoying this?"" (like a good person should, he wanted consent and just to know if i was liking the encounter) and no matter how much i said yes, because i was, i feel like he thinks less of me.

when we were cuddling i told him about my bpd and that i take meds for it, and he seemed okay with it. but yesterday we were texting, and he could kinda feel that i was sad, so i told him i just feel bad that we couldn't have sex, and he hasn't answered in a day. so of course, i'm overanalyzing that he hates me and i'm unlovable etc etc etc even though i know that's not true.

tl;dr so i guess i'm just asking if anyone else has sexual side effects from bpd meds, and what i could do about that to i can enjoy my sex life.

advice for coming off lamictal and/or pristiq?,"i've been on pristiq for 4 years and lamictal for 3 - i'm currently on 200mg of each. honestly i don't know if either of them are even helping anymore - i do get manic / depressed if i miss a dose or take it late, but i don't know if that's how i really am, or if it's just because i've been on them for so long that my body is reliant on them now.

i really don't want to be taking so much stuff for the rest of my life, and honestly the side effects are getting unbearable. i sweat soooo much, especially when i sleep (it gets to the point where sometimes i will wake up in the middle of the night and the mattress is soaked through), and i've developed hypersomnia - i sleep so much but i can still barely ever keep my eyes open.

Got LASIK while being under Lamotrigine,"it's been a week and i feel horrible, my eyes need to stay as hydrated as possible but the lamictal tends to dehydrate my entire body, skin, eyes, i'm always thirsty etc... 
because of the drug i feel like my recovery is much harder, i have terrible headache and eye pain (my eyes are fine my vision is too i'm just dehydrated... ) 
i can't go to work, can't watch screens for more than 10min, can't stay outside cause even a little wind is painful.

Some questions about BPD.... long scattered post but please read.,"**pretty long post and might be hard to make sense of because i'm a very scatterbrained adhd riddled person. i would appreciate if you could read through and provide input**

i just read a comment from a psychiatrist that said ""if you think you have borderline personality disorder, you probably don't"". how true is this? the more i read into bpd the more i suspect i have it. i'll try to sum up some of my symptoms and why i suspect i might have bpd. i probably won't even scratch the surface. but i'll try:

i grew up in a not so good environment. my dad dealt with severe mental illness and at the time was very unstable throughout my childhood. they separated soon after i was born but they lived across the street from each other so from my earliest memories i watched my dad verbally abuse my mother frequently, who is the sweetest and would never do anything to truly deserve it. i grew up listening to him belittle her and call her horrible the names. i don't know if this is relevant but this is just an insight to one of the reasons i could have developed it? i don't know.

anyways-- throughout my childhood and teenager years i saw many doctors, counselors, psychiatrists. the problem is from a very young age i learned how to manipulate my mood disorders to others. away from my mom and some of my family i could (mostly) control outbursts although in public they happened occasionally. i was especially good at pretending to be normal infront of doctors and would deny all of the issues my mom brought up. most of the times the doctors would dismiss me as a regular kid that had some slight mood issues. although i did receive a few diagnosis's of bi polar and a lot of diagnosis's of adhd. i never took the medication i was prescribed as a child which includes lithium and ritalin to name a few. 

along with severe mood swings i suffered from bad adhd as i said previous along with horrible anxiety from a very young age. school was hell to me as a child and it lasted all the way up until i dropped out of school. it was truly a nightmare. from kindergarten onward i can recall fighting my mom to go to school. not long after that i was always dealing with the school administration and eventually it would come to court and probation due to truancy. it was so bad that i didn't care the consequences and would not go. when i did go i could never focus probably due to adhd and anxiety as i said. i dropped out in early high school and eventually in my teenage years i turned to alcohol, then drugs which were mostly silly over the counter things but none the less it was a mostly everyday thing. eventually it would turn into hard drugs that resulted in me stealing and other random crimes which was never like me to ever do. i'd do all of this to fit in with the crowd around me that i found because most of the time being under the influence resulted in no anxiety for me which was so surreal. and no decision making either. this got me into a lot of legal trouble and most recently resulted in me doing a lot of jail time. 

fast forward nearly a year i've been sober since and don't have any cravings to use or anything like that. but the crippling anxiety and mood swings have only gotten worse to the point where i don't leave the house much. i'm always aggressive and yelling at the family member for no reason and i don't understand why. in the moment i feel like i mean the terrible things i say but then when i can force myself to stop and think about it i realize most of what i was mad about was irrational and tell myself i'll quit that nonsense for good. but it's an everyday thing that seems to be a loop. i hate it. i have too much anxiety to even apply for a job. i've only ever held a couple jobs and the best part is the longest i worked at any one of those was a couple of days. my anxiety gets the best of me and despite being on nearly every anti depressant there is, along with other medications such as my current regimen of lamictal, morning has even come close to helping. besides perhaps ativan or xanax, but of course i've never had more than a couple of days of a prescription so i don't know if it would have been helpful long term. 

most recently, within the last two years i saw a psychiatrist very briefly that didn't seem to think i had the bipolar i had been diagnosed with previous to that because i never had a case of mania. i had agreed and brought up bpd that at the time i had just briefly read about. she quickly dismissed that without even a discussion so i dropped it up until recently. so many of the symptoms fit in with me especially that no treatment has even scratched the surface. not counseling and especially not medication. but alas i suspect that i probably do not have it for the sole reason that it seems as though you don't usually recognize what's wrong with you and maybe for the worse i all to well know what's wrong with me and what i do wrong whether it be right after or some time after. it's a horrible feeling that eats at me.",1627017937,FALSE,BPD,2021-07-23 05:25:37,"Some questions about BPD.... long scattered post but please read. **pretty long post and might be hard to make sense of because i'm a very scatterbrained adhd riddled person. i would appreciate if you could read through and provide input**

Experience with Lamictal?,"so i finally told my psych on monday that i felt it was time to try a mood stabilizer. she said she usually starts with lamictal, and that it typically works for a lot of people. i was on it as a kid &amp; i don't remember how well it worked, but i wasn't really on it long. i take my first 25mg dose tonight, then spend the next 3 weeks titrating up. 

in your experience how well did it help particularly with mood swings? and how long did it take for the effects to reach their peak? any side effects? also, if it didn't work for you, what did you try next?

Staying motivated during a depressive episode?,"*i originally tried to post this in a bp group but since my account is new they're screening it.
i have both bpd and bp. not sure if people with bpd alone struggle with motivation but i figured i'd ask.

i'm currently too depressed to know if this is the best way to describe how i feel but here it goes: i'm sure many of you are familar with long lapses in motivation only to be followed by manic swings of conquering every topic you have a vague interest in only to drop it all. during my happy times i'm driven, caring, passionate, etc but then i go through 2-3 months where food tastes bland, a hot bath feels like nothing, my relationships are empty. i'm also diagnosed with general anxiety and bipolar. i've always loved art and i'm apprenticing as a tattoo artist (which i thought was my dream) but creating is giving me no satisfaction and my mind is dry of any inspiration. i don't know who to tell because nothing anyone says helps. for anyone else who has a ""favorite person"" i'm wondering if i'm alone in how i interact with mine. the only thing that makes my motivation better during a depressive state is validation from my fp and my relationships with my fps are usually volatile and so i'm a wreck and it feels like i only do anything to make whatever guy i'm feeling at the moment like me. when that relationship falls apart i feel stripped of everything and function sluggishly. it's like i'm withdrawing. i know i'm just using the high i get from their attention to balance out my anhedonia but i can't seem to break the cycle. i haven't been truly single in almost a decade.

my fp at the time died suddenly 3 years ago (on the 9th) and i have never truly let it go. valentine's day was his funeral and the person i've been seeing on and off since may seems to have abandoned me since monday and i'm not taking it well. i hate myself for not handling it like an adult.

i work my apprenticeship tomorrow but i'm struggling to fake wanting to be there and no one understands that deep down i probably care but i can't feel it right now. 
also the guy i was seeing works there and seeing him at shift change us fucking up my anxiety.
this shop is the best opportunity i've ever been given and my mental health is about to destroy it. i have bills to pay. i'm 3000 miles away from my friends and family. i have to overcome this. i'm currently taking lamotrigine (since june) and i just started gabapentin but i may switch to buspar soon. if you know any meds you had success with for bp, bpd or anxiety let me know and i'll ask my doctor. i was considering wellbutrin but i couldn't start at the time because i was very underweight. also if you have any other stategies to combat the emptiness.. i don't start therapy until wednesday (didn't seek help at all until june after my suicide plan fortunately went awry) and it's so hard to be ok right now.

sorry if this post is annoying i just really needed to vent and it's hard to explain to most of the people i know. they're scared of me or stigmatize mental disorders. i'm not using my diagnosis for pity. i wouldn't wish this numbness on anyone. i'm just hoping there's something i can do to find my passion and be ok without an fp.",1518412529,FALSE,BPD,2018-02-12 05:15:29,"Staying motivated during a depressive episode? *i originally tried to post this in a bp group but since my account is new they're screening it.

DAE feel like their meds are placebo? (Lamotrigine),"in the last few months i feel like i have made positive strides in my mental health. my situation is the best it has ever been, maybe not in terms of work but in terms of being able to get on with each day i feel like each day is not 100% a struggle.

that being said, i’m not sure whether or not medication has had an impact on this. i was on duloxetine for about 8 months between 2019 - early 2020, and it was definitely not for more. i slept a lot, was constantly nauseous, sex drive inhibited, mental landscape remained strained. i was off meds for about 6 months and then with the advice and support of my doctor moved onto lamotrigine. 

as of yesterday i am currently on 150mg a day, still working out what dose works for me. i don’t feel any serious side effects, no nausea, sleep has been unaffected, sex drive is normal (potentially higher because i feel less horrible all the time). my mood seems to be more stable and i am not only able to move on from things a whole lot quicker than i used to, but the desire to better myself is also present - something that i have never felt before. (actually, i feel immediately inebriated after just one drink, and it takes far less weed to get me high - now i’m a cheap date)

i know based on what i’ve just said it seems like the obvious common thread is the new meds, but i’m not sure whether that’s the case. my situation is much healthier now. i am in a stable relationship (as opposed to an abusive 2-year long relo in which i was cheated on consistently), i found out i malabsorb fructose and have since changed my diet (mostly) - i didn’t know that people ate without feeling incredible pain and bloating for days. i live in a new space, humble but i don’t need anything more. my relationships with my family and friends are no longer strained and restricted by my ex. my partner treats me well and supports me in every way he can.

i’m not sure i really believe that widespread placebos exist, i am sure legally they can’t. yet i’m not convinced that my meds aren’t just sugar pills. i have worked my way up from 12.5mg and have never felt any sickness when going up in dose, which feels strange to me. on my past meds when i upped a dose i felt incredibly sick and x2 depressed for up to a week. 

i’m sure i’m just convincing myself of this, because all signs are pointing to they’re a part of the puzzle of my healing, but my head and body don’t feel like the drugs are impacting that at all. weather this suspicion is because they are actually helping or not, either way i don’t notice their effect.

I'm verging to madness,"i'm literally going crazy. in this period i am having dissociative crises, i cannot remember my actions or give weight to what i do, i am careless, i forget things, even the most stupid ones. i wake up in the morning with a weight on my stomach and i don't know what to do, i don't know who i am, i'm sick. all my interests, all my hobbies have been lost. i'm taking drugs to go on, because the psychiatric drugs they prescribed for me have no effect on my mood (mainly antipsychotics). there are days when i suffer from loneliness and i cry like a baby, feeling myself like a heavy boulder. each step becomes an enterprise. on the other hand, there are days when loneliness does not even hit me because i am used to it and because i realize that if i had someone next to me, first of all i would destroy him/her and secondly i would also destroy myself. i'm always on a tightrope, always on the verge of getting pissed and having a burst of anger. it happened yesterday while i was texting a girl who i don't even know whether to consider my friend. this girl did something that is harmless to me now. last night, however, that thing was not harmless to me. i was in a strong state of paranoia, i got pissed, i had the poison inside me and i needed to spit it out. this poison was fermenting in my body, i felt it in my stomach and it started to flow up to my chest and mouth. i needed to spit this poison: i insulted her by hitting her weak points, i hurt her, i made her feel bad. this thing helped me relieve anxiety and distress, but only for a few hours. shortly thereafter another anxiety returned: the anxiety of being alone, of not being forgiven and of having hurt that person. i felt guilty, a real shit. she forgave me, but i know that when people forgive me, that forgiveness is a false forgiveness because words do not slip on anyone and not even bad deeds. i go from being pissed, empty, depressed and megalomaniacal in a day. it happens too often, too much within 24 hours. i'm in pain, i don't know what to do. i would like to have someone but at the same time i don't want anyone because i am afraid of being hurt. i consider myself too labile and unhealthy to be able to have a healthy relationship with someone. every relationship i had with a girl ended badly, every girl who was by my side suffered; i carry the pain with me and spread it on the bodies of others. i am not well when i get angry, i suffer because it is not what i would like, but at the same time i cannot contain it. i can't focus on anything else when i become psychotic.  i can't even explain this mental asphyxia. i have an ""emotional crater"" that is devouring me. i'm still in love with my ex and every day i worry about it because i really hurt her and now i miss her and her doesn't want to talk me because she's scared. sometimes anger is so devastating that it leads me to destroy and hurt even the most beautiful thing i love. this anger hurts me more than others. the psychiatrist who is treating me continues to denigrate my problem and pretend nothing. they prescribe me antipsychotics over antipsychotics such as lamictal and have no effect on me. i don't know what to do anymore, i'm going crazy and i'm sick. i almost broke my knuckles by punching the wall and this is becoming more and more frequent. i am sure that if i continue to feel bad i will kill myself with my own hands. i can't stand myself anymore.  this disease is destroying me and i was born with the bad luck of having it. i don't hate my mom and dad for mistreating me when i was a kid. i still remember the episodes in which, for example, my mother beat me and then told me that if i cried i would have taken twice the blow. i remember when one night i went to my parents' room and told my father that my tooth hurt and he gave me a backhand telling me to go to bed because it was late. i don't hate them for that, but in my life i never told either of them that i love them. for me they are neutral elements of the family, i am confused and i cannot recognize them as my parents. i live only for drugs, they're my only real purpose in life. when they will notice my body only because of the stench. i'm totally alone, caged in my own mind.",1581195792,FALSE,BPD,2020-02-08 21:03:12,"I'm verging to madness i'm literally going crazy. in this period i am having dissociative crises, i cannot remember my actions or give weight to what i do, i am careless, i forget things, even the most stupid ones. i wake up in the morning with a weight on my stomach and i don't know what to do, i don't know who i am, i'm sick. all my interests, all my hobbies have been lost. i'm taking drugs to go on, because the psychiatric drugs they prescribed for me have no effect on my mood (mainly antipsychotics). there are days when i suffer from loneliness and i cry like a baby, feeling myself like a heavy boulder. each step becomes an enterprise. on the other hand, there are days when loneliness does not even hit me because i am used to it and because i realize that if i had someone next to me, first of all i would destroy him/her and secondly i would also destroy myself. i'm always on a tightrope, always on the verge of getting pissed and having a burst of anger. it happened yesterday while i was texting a girl who i don't even know whether to consider my friend. this girl did something that is harmless to me now. last night, however, that thing was not harmless to me. i was in a strong state of paranoia, i got pissed, i had the poison inside me and i needed to spit it out. this poison was fermenting in my body, i felt it in my stomach and it started to flow up to my chest and mouth. i needed to spit this poison: i insulted her by hitting her weak points, i hurt her, i made her feel bad. this thing helped me relieve anxiety and distress, but only for a few hours. shortly thereafter another anxiety returned: the anxiety of being alone, of not being forgiven and of having hurt that person. i felt guilty, a real shit. she forgave me, but i know that when people forgive me, that forgiveness is a false forgiveness because words do not slip on anyone and not even bad deeds. i go from being pissed, empty, depressed and megalomaniacal in a day. it happens too often, too much within 24 hours. i'm in pain, i don't know what to do. i would like to have someone but at the same time i don't want anyone because i am afraid of being hurt. i consider myself too labile and unhealthy to be able to have a healthy relationship with someone. every relationship i had with a girl ended badly, every girl who was by my side suffered;

I'm NPD and BPD in a Co-Dependent Marriage,"background: i have a history of mood disorders and disassocation. i was medicated with mood stabilizers for 15 years beginning at nine years old. i was severely bullied from a young age. i didn't have a lot of friends. my parents absolutely hated each other but stayed together ""for the kids"". never had a relationship with my dad. my mom would not accept my bisexual identity. they hated gay people and most minorities. told me i'd be kicked out if i ever had sex or got pregnant. they spoiled me, but you could call their upbringing unconditional love. 

i've been suffering from panic attacks, disassociation, insomnia, intrusive thoughts, and severe mood/personality swings for the last six months ever since i started to realize things about myself and my husband. it started after a huge fight with him. he said some triggering things to me, things that toed the line of manipulation or psychological abuse. ""your body is my body."" ""go lay on the bed and get ready for sex or i'm watching porn"". but i said some selfish things and nasty things about him, things considered devaluing.

our relationship probably didn't start out very healthy. i had a history of sexually pleasing men in high school and college. he was one of them. i didn't really want to have sex but i wanted him to want me. he was so opinionated and funny and outspoken. he cheated on his gf with me. then we went a while without talking because he started telling people were sleeping together and his girlfriend made him block me on facebook. i was pissed, but looking back i had no right. 

so then i dated a terrible guy in the army who manipulated me and abused me, promised me we'd get married, got matching tattoos which i paid for, dumped me over the phone while he was halfway across the country, and later found out he cheated on me and gave me an std. i decided to run back to my now husband (that same night) who had broken up with his girlfriend (she ended up in a mental institution for wanting to kill herself). we built our relationship on sex. he promised me if i could make him finish from xx blowjobs, he would ""put a ring on it"". and i tried so hard to make that happen. after a few months, i found myself feeling more and more uncomfortable during sex. he had a lot of kinks, things like telling me he wanted to ""rape me"" or begging for threesomes. pushing my head down hard on his dick until i'm choking. he was addicted to porn, watching is for sometimes an hours or more at night, and then comparing me to girls in there. fraud charges on our credit cards from buying porn. i have found it very hard to enjoy sex. in fact, i kind of dread it.

i'm not broken though, and i'm definitely at fault, too. i've posted many anonymous naked pictures online. i formed an extremely addictive online sexual relationship with a woman (who turned out to be a catfish). i have such a strong desire to be wanted by strangers. basically, anyone who doesn't love me.

i started therapy after several huge fights with my husband and i started reading the 12 steps books after a lot of marijuana abuse on my end. i realized i was being selfish and not dealing with problems or communicating effectively. this is when i also realized i have a problem with attention-seeking, needing validation, and toxic relationships. my therapist said i sound a little codependent, bpd, and npd. our first year of marriage has been hard. probably harder than most people's. i just feel like it's either all black or all white. i either love him to death and act like his little ""baby"" and ""wifey"" or i just devalue him and act like he is a monster and an irresponsible idiot and talk trash about him to everyone. it's like i'm a different person around him.

he has adhd and has destroyed 3 cars in a year and i try to be understanding. however, i find myself thinking less and less of him and reconsidering a future with him. i've built so much contempt, i don't really know if this is the person i want to share my life with. i realize that's kind of selfish. is it wrong to think less of someone over money and cars? he claims he loves me so much, but i feel like, am i just giving of myself over and over again. one second ""it's fine baby, it's just money."" and the next second i'm throwing it in his face telling him he's a ""manchild"". we don't really have any goals together, and now that i'm saying it out loud it kind of scares me.

what's sad is that i think part of me does love him, or at least i thought i did. i'm so afraid to be without him. but i'm afraid i've just used him to fill my void of extreme loneliness. but ironically, he does the same to me! he doesn't want me to go on work trips, he doesn't want me to make friends, he doesn't talk to his family (his father abandoned him and his stepdad was abusive) and we really only talk about other people and surface-level things...

to make matters worse, i sometimes wonder if i'm actually a lesbian, or if i'm just craving someone new. i've only had one real experience with a woman when i was 16. i remember really enjoying it but feeling so ashamed that i broke it off with her and told her ""it's not normal. i need to be normal."" i was scared to death of my mom. i've actually confessed to him three months ago that i thought i was a lesbian, and then when i saw him crying i realized how bad i hurt him, which hurt me, and i quickly took it back. he's my favorite person, and i could not even imagine a life without him in it. so i told him i guess i've just been sexually traumatized so many times, i must just be confused. part of me longs to explore the lesbian side of me, but i also wonder if maybe i'm just a covert narcissist and i've gotten tired of him and i'm ready for my next thing. i remember talking to girls in college when i was younger and them saying ""you're such an asshole. it's a turn on."" or, ""you have such a big ego"". so the dilemna is, i'm not sure gender even matters. i think i just don't know how to love.

the psychiatrist has me on lamictal, topamax and zoloft. i'm scheduled for an assessment at a mental health hospital on wednesday, even though my husband thinks i'm possibly overthinking everything. i keep having moments where i'm like, ""what are you doing? you're fine. you're not a narc. he's gaslighting you and maybe if left you'd be okay."" and then i immediately start crying and saying ""no, this is you blaming him and trying to hide from your problems because you've been exposed and it feels like you don't know how to cope and you might lose him and your entire life is ruined"". and then i have a panic attack and my entire day goes to shit and i can't eat or sleep or breath. i don't know how to function.

tldr; i think i'm going through narcissistic moritification. i thought i loved my husband, but now i'm not sure. he's been a little manipulative and abusive, but i'm also at fault. also struggling with my sexuality, but can't tell if i'm truly confused or just longing for my next victim.",1634309981,FALSE,BPD,2021-10-15 14:59:41,"I'm NPD and BPD in a Co-Dependent Marriage background: i have a history of mood disorders and disassocation. i was medicated with mood stabilizers for 15 years beginning at nine years old. i was severely bullied from a young age. i didn't have a lot of friends. my parents absolutely hated each other but stayed together ""for the kids"". never had a relationship with my dad. my mom would not accept my bisexual identity. they hated gay people and most minorities. told me i'd be kicked out if i ever had sex or got pregnant. they spoiled me, but you could call their upbringing unconditional love.

$600/45 min or free eternity in the abyss?,"hello everyone!

currently, i am feeling not so good. terrible really. and i don't like it!

**dilemma: see my doctor for $600/45 minutes with the chance a new prescription will work or spend forever in a dark hole (for free!)?**

my insurance does not cover personality disorders (amongst many other things). my last bill was $600 and i can not afford that again (that is about 3 months of groceries for me).

does anyone have any advice about what i should do?

i am diagnosed with bpd, bipolar, adhd, depression, and beta thalassemia (genetic blood disorder).

i was doing well for a stretch of about a year. then these past few weeks have gone downhill. i cry all the time, in class, at the gym, on the phone. i feel no energy to do anything. as a full-time student at university, i can feel homework piling on me as i have a full credit load of senior level math, physics, and computer science courses (as well as undergraduate research). i also work as a tutor and find it hard to concentrate on the students and help them.

the decline happened right around when school started. it did not help that my new doctor took me off of vyvanse (20 mg) and abilify (7.5 mg) at the same time. i currently take lamictal (250 mg), sertraline (100 mg), and vienva (1.5 mg, birth control). unfortunately, there are no breaks on the school bus so i can't drop out and i must keep going to finish the semester. (i graduate fall 2019!)

what i have going for me: a rockin' partner who is helping me through this! unfortunately, i am pulling him down with the weight of my tears. i would like to stop doing that as soon as possible.

thanks for reading! also, if anyone ever needs to vent or something, pm me.",1550000412,FALSE,BPD,2019-02-12 19:40:12,"$600/45 min or free eternity in the abyss? hello everyone!

Is identity disturbance ALWAYS a sign of BPD?,"was diagnosed bipolar type ii earlier this year when an ssri snapped me out of severe depression and straight into a hypomanic phase within two days of taking it. i feel like the diagnosis fits my family history and some of my own past history. lamictal has made a huge difference in my life. however, i've always had issues with switching identities and it started in middle school during puberty. this has mostly been under control since starting lamictal (mood stabilizer). i still get interested in random stuff but it no longer becomes my entire personality. just a couple of examples:  


when i was 13, i became obsessed with a singer. i started dressing like her, did my hair like her, and thought that i was called upon to be her successor. she was all i could talk about. i even sometimes made people call me by her name (cringe).   


when i was 16, i watched the aviator and became obsessed with the idea of becoming a genius pilot.  


when i was 23, i became convinced that i was called upon to be jewish. i thought i could become a rabbi or transcribe the whole torah by hand.

i was diagnosed bipolar type ii at 29 years old. the thing is, between these 'identities' i've had a stable sense of self. i studied creative writing and literature in my ba, ma, and phd. i've had the same career which i love since 2015. i have stable relationships with close friends and my spouse.

Trigger warning/spilling my heart and story,"so about a month ago now, my (ex) partner, fp, twin flame, left. my ups and downs had made him depressed, the shame and the guilt is eating me alive inside. i was diagnosed with bulimia at 11, borderline at 21 and received a differential diagnosis of bipolar type ii shortly after the (first) uk lockdown was put in place. it was also a new psych that made the differential diagnosis. she left her post within three months. i was put on lamotrigine and lithium then taken off lithium shortly after the new psych left. having struggled with alcohol issues since my young teens, i finally broke that with the love and support of this man. coming up to a year sober in december. when he walked out, i was only two weeks completely off lithium, i quit smoking cannabis cold turkey and have not touched it since, nor do i miss it. the anxiety and the gut wrenching pain is consuming me however and i pray so hard daily for guidance, mercy and grace. having been severely bulimic all of my adult life, i have also not binged or purged since he left. i gave up drinking caffeine too which i used to drink a lot of. i sensed deep in my heart and soul i was losing him within perhaps the last six months of our relationship, and it drove me crazy. when he finally opened up, i over shared on social media, frantically messaged his friends and family and in general made a total mockery of myself. he has not blocked me, has repeatedly said he does not want to resort to that (the onset of a couple of the worse anxiety attacks i frantically messaged him detailing all the positive changes i had made and was making and that i was doing it all for him and to prove to him how much i wanted a life and future with him). neither of us doubt our love for one another, however he has become convinced we are not compatible. it is horrible to think of because i know deep down it is not true and that  my mental health is to blame for all of these blockages between us. since our last interaction, i've respected his wishes and left him alone., perhaps one of the few things i have left to feel a tiny bit of pride within myself about.

i've over spent in the last couple weeks on online psychics and readings. researched spells. i know this is obsession. i know none of it is healthy. i am in so much fear if i lose him forever i will lose one of the greatest blessings life ever gifted me. i still cling to faith he will reach out when he has had space and time and recognised my dedication to stablising and bettering myself. we had just got a kitten two days before he opened up and broke up with me. i had to pack his things up for him because he had only done half of it. the pain of doing that in itself i think was traumatic. i badly hurt myself that day too. (self harm) which i've generally managed to keep under control throughout my life with only periodic 'slip ups'.

i journal everyday, i write gratitude lists everyday, i engage with the professional mental health team looking after me (though not sure how much ed psych really cares) - she is also acting as my main psych currently whilst that post is filled. i exercise intensely every day, i go for walks outside every day. i look and apply for training and jobs every day. i meditate several times a day and i pray throughout the day too. i attend to my personal hygiene and have made a big effort to eat at least twice daily (i stopped eating in the initial two weeks after he had left and lost a stone a half). i don't look healthy and i am self conscious of that. 

&amp;#x200b;

i went online today to search for how to love yourself when you have borderline, and to reeducate myself on borderline. it massively triggered me and i have spiralled into shaking and anxiety. 

&amp;#x200b;

i am trying so hard. the ed psych actually said during our last phone appointment i was in her top three patients who work the hardest at their skills and getting better. so why does it feel not good enough to grant me any happiness or success in recover/stability?

i received the borderline diagnosis at 21 as i mentioned. i have a little boy who was one when that happened. the pain of receiving some answers, but painful,hard to accept truths about myself again prompted more self hatred and doubt. my childs father was alot older than me, kind of preyed on me if i'm being honest when i was 19 and heavily drinking. i believed falling pregnant was the universe giving me a chance at a happy life. how wrong i was. my son is the best thing that ever happened to me but his father has brought such trauma to me. he cheated shortly after our sons first birthday and then began a relationship with her. she is older than him , no children, lots of money and twenty years my senior.  i've struggled financially, to hold down jobs, to save money.  i couldn't afford the house we (childs father and i) rented so i had to claim homeless with the local council. i had to declare bankruptcy from the debt i was left with. i took seizures from the stress, i still take seizures periodically which the doctors have put down to severe psychological stress. i moved house, and then had a complete break down. i gave my son to my childs father, believing he and his new partner could and would provide the stability and finances that he deserved and needed. they then took me to court to make it legally binding and my mental health was used against me, just as my childs father had used it against me since we first met. i've done so much therapy to reverse the belief i could not and would never be a capable,deserving  and loving mother.

 i get my son every week and it is the only light at the end of the tunnel for me. the whole reason i fight so hard. for him and my beloved (ex) partner. the reason, truth be told, i am still alive today. all i ever wanted was a happy healthy stable life with them.

&amp;#x200b;

i ended up in the care of the local authority when i was 14, and was raped of my virginity in that care home. i was forced to go to the police but my case was never taken to court. not long ago, i found online that he went on to rape another young girl who did get a conviction and he was sent to the state hospital. i pray for him everyday, he was so messed up, i blamed myself for what happened.

[pseudo-xpost] Anyone with previously misdiagnosed or current duo-diagnosed with Bipolar disoder? Differences in treatment for personality disorders compared to bipolar spectrum illnesses?,"this is a copy and pasted post from /r/bipolarreddit ([https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolarreddit/comments/bgwzz9/anyone\_with\_previously\_misdiagnosed\_or\_current/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolarreddit/comments/bgwzz9/anyone_with_previously_misdiagnosed_or_current/)) . i asked the mods if this post was okay and we agreed that it was under the condition that i highly reiterate that i am not asking for a diagnosis. only a doctor can decide this. i am fully aware of the dangers of self-diagnosis. i have no intentions of seeking a diagnosis from this post nor diagnosing myself. this is elaborated upon in the first paragraph of the post. thank you. here is the post:

&amp;#x200b;

""i've always been in denial for all of my diagnoses. its part of me trying to comprehend the profound impact that my psychiatric situations have placed upon my life. i'm not trying to diagnosing myself, never have and never will, but i'm trying to better identify the past and current symptoms/occurrences that could be valuable data to provide to my psychologist and psychiatrist. i am mostly wondering about my behavioral symptoms that i have previously disregarded, and am wondering if i should present them to my psychologist when i go home in 2 months. to reiterate, i am not asking for a diagnosis, just asking if any of you have experienced similar symptoms to me and if your doctors considered them to be medically relavent. thanks!

i'm currently diagnosed bipolar nos. been a psychiatric patient for 4-5 years, since age 14-15. multiple suicide attempts, self harm, grandiose and reoccurring suicidal ideations. rapid cycling and increased self harm from antidepressants. negative physical side effects from antipsychotics. my docs and i only have only identified really minor manic episodes that don't usually last more than a month and aren't too dangerous. other times it can be very short, a week or so. but theres always a depression crash when it ends.

thats an incredibly short summary of why me and my doctors treat me for bipolar disorder using lamictal.

sometimes i wonder if i have a personality disorder. sometimes my mood is just so fucking irregular. i cant ever tell how my day is going to go because i always wake up feeling completely different and never well rested. i cut people in and out of my life over periods of many months. i more often than not create delusions that these people are out to get me and that they're enemies and that i need to stay away from them. it feels like i cant remember these people sometimes. especially when i start hanging out with them again. it feels like my ego and values are constantly changing and that i have multiple people that take turns in my head. all of my romantic relationships have revolved around codependency and me using the so as a bracer for my instability. i cant deal with being criticized. i don't know who i am and often look at other people and am amazed at their ability to constantly flow through life with a stable set of values. they wake up and are able to go through life with the same brain that they had yesterday and the day before and the day before. their identity is constant and doesn't seem to change drastically. sometimes i talk in multiple voices/accents. sometimes when i respond to something i will say 2 similar things but in 2 different voices.

2 months ago i experienced a lot of motivation, hard work, social prowess, etc. life for me was really good, i was actually dating again and shit. recently it ended and now im just stuck in depression. people are wondering why i haven't seem them for a few weeks.

i feel like im always changing. but thats just life at my age, and life in general, i shouldn't fucking align simple issues with a desire for psychiatric treatment. it does not even matter if the treatment for bipolar illnesses and bpd is similar. i always think about how i feel and if this emptiness can be fixed or if the life that normal people get to the experience is out of my reach forever. oof.

those of you who have personality disorders, or have been treated for them, or something similar:

what medications did your doctor prescribe to treat your personality disorder? what was different about it compared to medication that you received to treat bipolar disorder?

what were areas of behavioral interest for you and your therapist/psychologist to discuss and work on?

what was the main reason for you to have changed diagnoses, or maintain your current one?

thanks for taking the time to read my post.""

&amp;#x200b;

do any of you have similar experiences to this? its so difficult to be psychotically suicidal for a few hours and then be fine for the next few. its so difficult and i feel like im just a pussy and faking but it feels so real and so out of control. i dont want to believe that this is true. what do i do?

Differences in treatment for personality disorders compared to bipolar spectrum illnesses? this is a copy and pasted post from /r/bipolarreddit ([https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolarreddit/comments/bgwzz9/anyone\_with\_previously\_misdiagnosed\_or\_current/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolarreddit/comments/bgwzz9/anyone_with_previously_misdiagnosed_or_current/)) . i asked the mods if this post was okay and we agreed that it was under the condition that i highly reiterate that i am not asking for a diagnosis. only a doctor can decide this. i am fully aware of the dangers of self-diagnosis. i have no intentions of seeking a diagnosis from this post nor diagnosing myself. this is elaborated upon in the first paragraph of the post. thank you. here is the post:

&amp;#x200b;

""i've always been in denial for all of my diagnoses. its part of me trying to comprehend the profound impact that my psychiatric situations have placed upon my life. i'm not trying to diagnosing myself, never have and never will, but i'm trying to better identify the past and current symptoms/occurrences that could be valuable data to provide to my psychologist and psychiatrist. i am mostly wondering about my behavioral symptoms that i have previously disregarded, and am wondering if i should present them to my psychologist when i go home in 2 months. to reiterate, i am not asking for a diagnosis, just asking if any of you have experienced similar symptoms to me and if your doctors considered them to be medically relavent. thanks!

i'm currently diagnosed bipolar nos. been a psychiatric patient for 4-5 years, since age 14-15. multiple suicide attempts, self harm, grandiose and reoccurring suicidal ideations. rapid cycling and increased self harm from antidepressants. negative physical side effects from antipsychotics. my docs and i only have only identified really minor manic episodes that don't usually last more than a month and aren't too dangerous. other times it can be very short, a week or so. but theres always a depression crash when it ends.

thats an incredibly short summary of why me and my doctors treat me for bipolar disorder using lamictal.

sometimes i wonder if i have a personality disorder. sometimes my mood is just so fucking irregular. i cant ever tell how my day is going to go because i always wake up feeling completely different and never well rested. i cut people in and out of my life over periods of many months. i more often than not create delusions that these people are out to get me and that they're enemies and that i need to stay away from them. it feels like i cant remember these people sometimes. especially when i start hanging out with them again. it feels like my ego and values are constantly changing and that i have multiple people that take turns in my head. all of my romantic relationships have revolved around codependency and me using the so as a bracer for my instability. i cant deal with being criticized. i don't know who i am and often look at other people and am amazed at their ability to constantly flow through life with a stable set of values. they wake up and are able to go through life with the same brain that they had yesterday and the day before and the day before. their identity is constant and doesn't seem to change drastically. sometimes i talk in multiple voices/accents. sometimes when i respond to something i will say 2 similar things but in 2 different voices.

2 months ago i experienced a lot of motivation, hard work, social prowess, etc. life for me was really good, i was actually dating again and shit. recently it ended and now im just stuck in depression. people are wondering why i haven't seem them for a few weeks.

i feel like im always changing. but thats just life at my age, and life in general, i shouldn't fucking align simple issues with a desire for psychiatric treatment. it does not even matter if the treatment for bipolar illnesses and bpd is similar. i always think about how i feel and if this emptiness can be fixed or if the life that normal people get to the experience is out of my reach forever. oof.

those of you who have personality disorders, or have been treated for them, or something similar:

what medications did your doctor prescribe to treat your personality disorder? what was different about it compared to medication that you received to treat bipolar disorder?

what were areas of behavioral interest for you and your therapist/psychologist to discuss and work on?

what was the main reason for you to have changed diagnoses, or maintain your current one?

thanks for taking the time to read my post.""

&amp;#x200b;

do any of you have similar experiences to this? its so difficult to be psychotically suicidal for a few hours and then be fine for the next few. its so difficult and i feel like im just a pussy and faking but it feels so real and so out of control. i dont want to believe that this is true. what do i do?

Advice?,"hi there. just looking for some general advice.

i've struggled with mood issues and depression for years, beginning as early as fifth grade where i first mentioned suicide to my parents.
 

in middle school i received a vague diagnosis of bipolar disorder type two, and i began treatment.


for the last year or so, i have become more and more unstable both in thoughts about myself and my relationships with others. my depression also became more severe, and i began self harming.


wondering if i might have been misdiagnosed after some research, i brought up the issue with my psychiatrist after feeling a deeper connection to bpd than bp type two.


well, he recommended a psychologist to me who does psychological testing. after quite a few tests, i got quite the whammy of a diagnosis. yes- i did have bipolar disorder. but- i also had bpd, gad, and dependent personality disorder and negativistic (also known as passive aggressive) personality disorder.



i'm still on the meds i was before my newest diagnosis- lamictal, zoloft, and xanax. i also just started taking a very low dose of amitriptyline but that is more for my very severe ibs. 


i also really liked the psychologist who did my testing, and he has offered to do therapy for me which is a relief. he is a psychotherapist and said he will be incorporating parts of dbt and cbt into my therapy.


i don't have any very specific questions, but i was wondering if any of you have advice for a teenager on the verge of graduating high school coping with the intensity of bpd, in addition to several other mental health diagnoses. i think i'm on the right track, but i want to know if there is anything else i should be doing. 

let me know if i have left anything important out.

DAE lose nearly all memory/ability to recall events when dissociating?,"today i dissociated (and am still dissociating) after 2 extremely traumatic events came down on me very quickly. 

i’ve never dissociated this bad before, and i’m exhausted. it takes everything in me to not slip back into a worse state where i can’t walk/talk/do anything. my eyes always dart from place to place, and i can’t sit down and watch anything on my tv or phone (this is so hard for me to type), i have to be fully distracted by a family member 

anyway, i’ve spent the day having my mom ask me questions to distract myself and 9/10 times my mind would essentially wipe itself and i wouldn’t be able to recall anything at all. don’t know what classes i’m taking really, can’t recall major events etc. i had a dissociative episode when i was 15 (i’m almost 22 now) and ended up laying in a creek fully clothed, which i have little to no recollection of

i smoke about a bowl of weed nightly and it helps me immensely, but last night and today i was out. i know that weed can cause me to have brain farts but never that bad. is this probably the bpd dissociation? 

i took 1mg klonopin, 1mg xanax xr, and 50mg lamictal. although i’m currently fighting hard, i don’t feel as scared as i did this morning thankfully, so i’m hopeful 

right now, i’m going to try to watch asmr and maybe hopefully sleep, i’ve been awake for 24 hours but i may not be able to sleep until i get my weed tonight.

So apparently I've gotten a lot worse and my therapist doesn't know if there's a point in me continuing DBT,"well, i don't know what to think really. according to a test i took last week, i've done it two times before, i'm a lot worse in my symptoms. 

i started dbt on 19th of august 2015, and i have been participating as i should and learning skills. i have a little trouble implementing them as they don't seem to really help, but i guess it takes time and practice. other than that i've had no issues progressing. my therapist was quite surprised that i've gotten worse, and was definitely expecting the opposite. i think the score might be because i have more insight in how i feel and i reflect a lot more over my emotions and thoughts than i did before, at least in another way, so the previous scores could be faulty, but i honestly don't know.

the test we take is called kaboss-s which includes borderline, depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive behaviour.

**first time i did this test (august):**

depression - 29 points

anxiety - 25 points

obsessive compulsive behaviour - 22 points

borderline - 35 points

**second time (october):**

depression - 30 points

anxiety - 23 points

obsessive compulsive behaviour - 27 points

borderline - 29 points

**and now...**

depression - 37 points

anxiety - 34 points

obsessive compulsive behaviour - 33 points

borderline - 42 points

i don't know what to think of these scores. i don't know why it's worse. i don't know if dbt is for me. we did renew the contract for another 6 months though, just to be sure. 

i feel kind of numb to all this. i don't know what i should feel. it all seems kind of hopeless and meaningless. i don't think this is real. i don't know how to explain it but i don't really believe these scores. i may have gotten worse, yes, but... i don't know. i don't feel like i even know myself. i know myself even less than i did before. i'm empty all the time. every emotion that isn't negative is forced, which is sad, but i don't even care because the caring part is also gone. i am completely different emotionally from how i was last summer. i don't know this person, i feel like there isn't much left of the person i used to be, whoever that was.

i've also tried a few new meds this year, so that might be contributing. right now i am not on any antidepressant because the last one made me throw up every day for 3 weeks and i couldn't eat, so i had to quit even though it was improving my depression. i've got an appointment with my doctor tomorrow so hopefully we'll try out something new. i'm sick of all these meds. i just want to find one that works, alongside lamotrigine. i just feel like giving up, tossing my meds, quitting dbt and just release the kraken. i don't want to care or hold back anymore. i want some god damn results from the work i put in. i want to live a normal life. i don't feel like i live in the same reality as those around me, like i'm somewhere else.",1460398543,FALSE,BPD,2016-04-11 18:15:43,"So apparently I've gotten a lot worse and my therapist doesn't know if there's a point in me continuing DBT well, i don't know what to think really. according to a test i took last week, i've done it two times before, i'm a lot worse in my symptoms.

i don't know what to think of these scores. i don't know why it's worse. i don't know if dbt is for me. we did renew the contract for another 6 months though, just to be sure. 

i feel kind of numb to all this. i don't know what i should feel. it all seems kind of hopeless and meaningless. i don't think this is real. i don't know how to explain it but i don't really believe these scores. i may have gotten worse, yes, but... i don't know. i don't feel like i even know myself. i know myself even less than i did before. i'm empty all the time. every emotion that isn't negative is forced, which is sad, but i don't even care because the caring part is also gone. i am completely different emotionally from how i was last summer. i don't know this person, i feel like there isn't much left of the person i used to be, whoever that was.

i've also tried a few new meds this year, so that might be contributing. right now i am not on any antidepressant because the last one made me throw up every day for 3 weeks and i couldn't eat, so i had to quit even though it was improving my depression. i've got an appointment with my doctor tomorrow so hopefully we'll try out something new. i'm sick of all these meds. i just want to find one that works, alongside lamotrigine. i just feel like giving up, tossing my meds, quitting dbt and just release the kraken. i don't want to care or hold back anymore. i want some god damn results from the work i put in. i want to live a normal life. i don't feel like i live in the same reality as those around me, like i'm somewhere else.",apparently ive gotten lot worse therapist doesnt know there point continuing dbt well dont know think really according test took last week ive done two time im lot worse symptom started dbt 19th august 2015 participating learning skill little trouble implementing dont seem really help guess take time practice ive issue progressing therapist quite surprised ive gotten worse definitely expecting opposite think score might insight feel reflect lot emotion thought least another way previous score could faulty honestly dont know test take called kabosss includes borderline depression anxiety obsessive compulsive behaviour first time test august depression 29 point anxiety 25 point obsessive compulsive behaviour 22 point borderline 35 point second time october depression 30 point anxiety 23 point obsessive compulsive behaviour 27 point borderline 29 point depression 37 point anxiety 34 point obsessive compulsive behaviour 33 point borderline 42 point dont know think score dont know worse dont know dbt renew contract another 6 month though sure feel kind numb dont know feel seems kind hopeless meaningless dont think real dont know explain dont really believe score may gotten worse yes dont know dont feel like even know know even le im empty time every emotion isnt negative forced sad dont even care caring part also gone completely different emotionally last summer dont know person feel like isnt much left person used whoever ive also tried new med year might contributing right antidepressant last one made throw every day 3 week couldnt eat quit even though improving depression ive got appointment doctor tomorrow hopefully well try something new im sick med want find one work alongside lamotrigine feel like giving tossing med quitting dbt release kraken dont want care hold back anymore want god damn result work put want live normal life dont feel like live reality around like im somewhere else,0.8079829408004980,['Lamotrigine'],"```json

"Feels like I try and try, then go nowhere","a little background information about myself: 25-year-old mtf, diagnosed bipolar at age 17 and diagnosed bpd at age 24. i've been to a mental hospital twice, both times seriously messed me up.

i've been going to dbt therapy for almost 2 years now, and i feel like i'm getting nowhere. my therapist keeps telling me that i'm doing better and encourages me to keep trying, but i feel like i'm just getting better at lying. i flip-flop between showing little emotion, followed by outbursts of shame, guilt, and sadness. i keep a mood diary which clearly shows that i cycle on a monthly basis. it has no correlation to my hormone shots (weekly), therapy schedule (daily), lunar phases (don't be silly), etc. 

i'm on wellbutrin and lamictal. i steal my parent's propranolol and it really fucking helps. i doubt anyone will write me a prescription for it. 

i don't get it. i try so hard to be a decent and positive person, and i'm publicly bubbly to compensate for being privately depressed. i really don't give a shit about anyone anymore. i'm tired all the time. i regularly drive 110 miles an hour on the freeway. i hate being transgender, i hate everything i have to go through in preparation for surgery, and i think about suicide daily. i'm one of the lucky souls: i pass so well i model, my parents love me, financially support me and my transition, and are paying for my surgery. 

last week i had to listen to my mentor talk about how trans women are ugly, financially burdening society, shoving our agenda down peoples throats, taking the meaning out of pronouns, and how they're just confused gay men. if i say anything i'll lose the only job i have and love. i won't say anything, because at least he sees me as a woman. at least he feels comfortable and safe to tell me how shitty of a person he is behind closed doors. he clearly has no idea i'm transgender, but i can barely look him in the eye anymore.

and it's as if none of that matters. i feel like i don't get to complain about anything. people are so shitty to others, tell me to suck it up and find the silver lining.

i feel so fucking ugly, and wronged by nature. i've gone through so much fucking pain to get my pubic hair removed in order to have srs. no doctor will write me a prescription for opiates. it's like getting slapped in the balls over and over and over again with a bug zapper on a rubber band. i've resorted to large doses of opiates just to take the edge off. my partner keeps the stash, gives me a dose every two weeks as to avoid addiction, and has to stay up all night and watch me just to make sure i don't vomit and asphyxiate in my sleep (spoiler i almost have multiple times).

after months of going through this, i went to see my doctor who will do my surgery. he told me i'm not even fucking close. it's such an ordeal to set up appointments, arrange for designated drivers, illegally obtain drugs, and still be in pain. it hurts to be told i'm not making tangible progress. i still have no surgery date. it's as if all of my planning, determination, and pain are meaningless. i feel like this process is slowly killing me, and it's leaving me feeling worthless, depressed, and like no one cares about me. 

i told my therapist that i don't want to die, but i really don't want to live anymore. my therapists don't understand. i feel as if i'm doing everything right and to the best of my abilities, but i'm going nowhere. now i feel like i'm letting go, and not caring about anything. i feel so numb.

What is going to come of my untreated BPD?,"hi everyone. i was diagnosed with bpd just this past november after a lot of misdiagnoses of bipolar disorder and depression. i used to be on abilify and prozac but it stopped working after about a year of me taking it, and when i was diagnosed with bpd i was prescribed lamictal, but i was coming off the other medication combo and trying to adapt to this one and i felt so physically and mentally exhausted from the strain of taking medicine that i stopped taking both and just pursued therapy. things haven't been the best but they are drastically better than when i was on medication. i'm a frequent smoker and i find that, in moderation, it really helps me not have terrible mood swings. my moods and emotional instability and my tendency to be irrational are really the worst parts of my disorder. i can go from swimmingly happy or at least content to terribly hateful of myself and the world. i cry a lot, and there was a period a few weeks ago where i cried multiple times every day for two weeks. i feel anger a lot too, but a lot of it i place on myself or bottle up, which i've noticed has been elevating my states of anger more. i'm always irritated and little things can get me very angry and depressed. i've been seeing a therapist regularly, and i was learning a lot and making great steps, though after the sessions i would feel depressed having to confront my shitty and destructive tendencies. still, it was helping. however, i came to therapy today and was pulled aside by the supervisor of my therapist who told me that my therapist had to leave the agency for personal reasons he couldn't explain. now, i get very attached to people, especially therapists that i've admitted a lot to, and talked extensively with about my problems. i've had my fair share of therapists and he was one of my favorites. i was okay for a while after i heard the news but then i got this wave of frustration about the situation. that's another thing... when things don't go how they ""should"" or how they are expected to, i almost just completely lose it. i hardly think of suicide seriously but when i got upset about all this all of these hateful emotions just came up and my inner monologue was so hatefully pessimistic and ready to just end it all. i'm scared of these reactions and these emotions, and i wonder if it has to do with my technically untreated disorder? i know i would probably feel better in some sense with medication, but the side effects of meds (and i've taken many kinds) always make me feel so unlike myself. i guess i'm just venting, but is there anyone out there not on medication dealing with bpd?

I've spent 10 yrs working in mental health and really just now recognized my own BPD,"hi everyone, looking for advice/insight here. i discovered this group about a week ago and have pretty much immersed myself in reading past posts and comments. i hope it isn’t too offputting that my first post is a “help me diagnose myself” post!

so, i’m in kind of a weird predicament. i am, after 36 years, starting to recognize the fact that i have major mood issues. i’ve been to a few psychiatrists and therapists and have never been diagnosed as such, but tbh i really only stuck around with each for a few sessions, and i have become pretty good as masking my issues. 

i don’t even want to call it “masking” because it isn’t something i do intentionally, its more of a subconscious sort of defense-mechanism.  

the weirder thing is i’ve spent the better part of my life working in mental health. i’ve been a mh nurse for 7 years now and before that, spent 2-3 years as a behavioral health tech and studying psychology. i guess it really isn’t that weird, in fact, there’s an age-old theory that it’s those with mental health issues of their own who are drawn to this industry. even still, it isn’t easy to diagnose yourself, especially if the presentation is not textbook.

i’ve been with my husband for 7 years now. the first few were (relatively) smooth. i actually used to profess to myself a lot how i had finally just met the right person, that this was how “it should be” to be in a healthy relationship with no arguing. i still believe that to am extent, he is the first person i’ve been with who hasn’t put me through a string of affairs or unhealthy situations. but nowdays we argue. a lot. like, pathologically a lot. we can’t seem to even have a conversation about anything without arguing.

he has insisted for years that i have strong symptoms of bpd (he says bipolar. i've always said it's more borderline). i haven’t felt the need to officially have a diagnosis, i think for several reasons: 


1.       i worry a little about what it would mean to have that in my “file” because of the fact that the same company i work for is also my health insurance company, and also the same company/group of physicians/psychiatrists that i intend to work under for my graduate preceptorship (i am going to school to become a mental health np)
 

2.      while it started as something i thought was 100% well meaning, nowadays the feeling i get from my husband is that he wants to use this label as a sort of scapegoat so that anything going wrong in our relationship can be attributed to “my issues” -- rather than concrete things we both need to work on. all arguments seem to end in ""you really need help."" this is kind of a whole sperate subject, so i won’t really go into that/will save that for another time. but anyway, that’s part of why i am reluctant to seek an official diagnosis. i worry what that would mean for our relationship. 

 
i am seeing a psychiatrist next week via “doctor on demand” and plan to be like, really honest with her. the thing is, i *was* honest with my last psychiatrist and told him things like “i get mood swings a lot” and “i find things wrong each and every day, sometimes 20 or 30 times a day” and “i get irritable at the slightest thing going wrong”
 

i wonder if he thought i was maybe self-diagnosing/leaning toward a certain diagnosis as people tend to do. i can say those things to him, but the person i present is relaxed/calm, patient. this is how i act at work also. then i come home, see that the dishes aren’t done or something and i completely lose it.
 
 

 my husband thinks i need to be more honest with the doctor. i don’t know. it’s hard to not feel like a lot of my anger, irritability and mood are actually circumstantial. i have high expectations of my partner to be fully involved in childcare and housework, and he kind of deludes himself into thinking were equally carrying our weight, when i feel like it's more like 70/30. 


i also carry a lot of resentment because we decided to have a child (his first child) after my older son was grown and i was just getting my career set, now i am back to being stuck in a really routine domestic setting while he advances his career and gets the recognition as the major bread winner. i won’t go too into that though.
 
the things that point to bpd

1.       severe and rapid mood swings every day

so, i’m sorry to make my first post about this kinda thing. i was hoping to get some input i really value and appreciate the insight i see here in this board. you guys collectively know way more about bpd than most professionals i work with. i plan to meet with the doctor on monday, try to be more open and communicative, and discuss trying a mood stabilizer. i am thinking of lamictal. i have to be careful with medication with my migraines. i tried neurontin and topamax in the past (for migraines) but saw little effect on my mood, but i know those aren’t first line at all. 

tia everyone. i promise i'll pay it forward and help another newbie when the time comes",1581192281,FALSE,BPD,2020-02-08 20:04:41,"I've spent 10 yrs working in mental health and really just now recognized my own BPD hi everyone, looking for advice/insight here. i discovered this group about a week ago and have pretty much immersed myself in reading past posts and comments. i hope it isn’t too offputting that my first post is a “help me diagnose myself” post!

so, i’m in kind of a weird predicament. i am, after 36 years, starting to recognize the fact that i have major mood issues. i’ve been to a few psychiatrists and therapists and have never been diagnosed as such, but tbh i really only stuck around with each for a few sessions, and i have become pretty good as masking my issues. 

i don’t even want to call it “masking” because it isn’t something i do intentionally, its more of a subconscious sort of defense-mechanism.  

the weirder thing is i’ve spent the better part of my life working in mental health. i’ve been a mh nurse for 7 years now and before that, spent 2-3 years as a behavioral health tech and studying psychology. i guess it really isn’t that weird, in fact, there’s an age-old theory that it’s those with mental health issues of their own who are drawn to this industry. even still, it isn’t easy to diagnose yourself, especially if the presentation is not textbook.

i’ve been with my husband for 7 years now. the first few were (relatively) smooth. i actually used to profess to myself a lot how i had finally just met the right person, that this was how “it should be” to be in a healthy relationship with no arguing. i still believe that to am extent, he is the first person i’ve been with who hasn’t put me through a string of affairs or unhealthy situations. but nowdays we argue. a lot. like, pathologically a lot. we can’t seem to even have a conversation about anything without arguing.

he has insisted for years that i have strong symptoms of bpd (he says bipolar. i've always said it's more borderline). i haven’t felt the need to officially have a diagnosis, i think for several reasons: 


1.       i worry a little about what it would mean to have that in my “file” because of the fact that the same company i work for is also my health insurance company, and also the same company/group of physicians/psychiatrists that i intend to work under for my graduate preceptorship (i am going to school to become a mental health np)
 

2.      while it started as something i thought was 100% well meaning, nowadays the feeling i get from my husband is that he wants to use this label as a sort of scapegoat so that anything going wrong in our relationship can be attributed to “my issues” -- rather than concrete things we both need to work on. all arguments seem to end in ""you really need help."" this is kind of a whole sperate subject, so i won’t really go into that/will save that for another time. but anyway, that’s part of why i am reluctant to seek an official diagnosis. i worry what that would mean for our relationship. 

 
i am seeing a psychiatrist next week via “doctor on demand” and plan to be like, really honest with her. the thing is, i *was* honest with my last psychiatrist and told him things like “i get mood swings a lot” and “i find things wrong each and every day, sometimes 20 or 30 times a day” and “i get irritable at the slightest thing going wrong”
 

i wonder if he thought i was maybe self-diagnosing/leaning toward a certain diagnosis as people tend to do. i can say those things to him, but the person i present is relaxed/calm, patient. this is how i act at work also. then i come home, see that the dishes aren’t done or something and i completely lose it.
 
 

 my husband thinks i need to be more honest with the doctor. i don’t know. it’s hard to not feel like a lot of my anger, irritability and mood are actually circumstantial. i have high expectations of my partner to be fully involved in childcare and housework, and he kind of deludes himself into thinking were equally carrying our weight, when i feel like it's more like 70/30. 


i also carry a lot of resentment because we decided to have a child (his first child) after my older son was grown and i was just getting my career set, now i am back to being stuck in a really routine domestic setting while he advances his career and gets the recognition as the major bread winner. i won’t go too into that though.
 
the things that point to bpd

1.       severe and rapid mood swings every day


 
2.       extreme irritability, extremely low tolerance for stress. this isn’t at work or anywhere else though, its almost pretty much just home and in my mind, stems from a strong desire to be alone/decompress and some barrier to being able to do that (kids, messy house, etc)

My Story and Advice on getting Healthy,"hello,

i've recently been diagnosed with bpd, and i'm motivated to work as hard as possible to combat this thing and lead a healthier life. 

my story:
i've always been afraid of rejection and whether people like me or not. this has caused my self-esteem to get really low, and has also prevented me from pursuing certain career choices because i thought i wasn't good enough or i didn't want to be rejected. the biggest area that my bpd affects are my relationships. all of my serious ones have never lasted more than 8 months and when i'm broken up with, i'm devastated for years. 

what motivated me to seek help:
this time last year i was in an amazing relationship with this wonderful guy. we just clicked really well and had all the same goals and outlooks on life. however, we were in a long-distance relationship because i was in grad school ~2 hours away and he lived with his mom, helping to take care of his disabled dad. eventually, he got an offer from an old college professor to get his masters in canada, free tuition. this turned our 2 hour ldr into an 8 hour distance. i was so frustrated at the time with the distance that i would pick fights that i knew would bug him, like money or religion. after 2 months of living in canada, he broke up with me and i was devastated. fast-forward 10 months to today, and the breakup still feels fresh and he is now dating his roommate who also got the same full ride to get her masters. i've been obsessively contacting him for months to the point where he wants to end all communication with me, which is understandable. i still think about him all the time and over-romanticize our relationship. last time this happened where i was devastated by a breakup, it took me 2.5 years to get over the guy completely. i don't want it to take that long again to get over an ex.

current plan of action:
i work out and i eat healthy, i've also reconnected with a lot of friends and i've been trying to fill up my social calendar. i just started seeing a np and a therapist. i'm on lamictal (after an adverse reaction to zoloft), trazodone for sleep, and the recommended dbt therapy (which hasn't started yet because i'm moving and need to find a new therapist). 

advice:
1. what other healthy activities should i look into?
2. how do i stop obsessing over my ex? i've told him about the bpd, and he was very understanding, but when my mind starts to wander i think about him and i cry and cry for hours....i don't get anything done and i want this to stop. 
3. are there any books or evidence based articles that are useful for reading?
4. i'm graduating with my masters in december, but i'm already having second thoughts about my career and i want to go back to school and pursue something a little different. is this related to my bpd? or should i pursue a new career after i graduate?
5. how do you stop day-dreaming and dissociating? this kind of practice has helped my get over stressful situations by giving myself false hope and separating myself from the current stressers. it really isn't a healthy process since reality is never as good as my day-dreams and i feel lower than before. 
4. is there hope? will i overcome this bpd, and lead a healthy relationship? should i give up on dating and just settle into a life of singlehood? i'm too afraid of experiencing another breakup and the adverse emotional reactions i have to them, that it doesn't seem worth it.

Any advice on dealing with Lamictal withdrawal?,"so aside from my current mood i finally feel like i'm at a good place to start trying to take less meds. my only 2 problems in the last good while have been insomnia and anxiety, plus crying from pms or if there's a situational explanation. i'm also with a very kind and supportive boyfriend who never gets irritated with me for my emotions and is 150% sure he will marry me. 

the amount of meds i've been taking is just ridiculous. so to start i'm tapering my lamictal in increments written by my doctor. in addition to my desire to take less meds, i think there is a very strong possibility that the lamictal has been contributing to my bad insomnia (i mean there are other factors too though). 

i just decreased from 300mg to 200mg (apparently part of the reason it was a high dose is because my birth control makes it less effective) and it is day 3. i still feel just horrible. i've been overly emotional and crazy anxious basically constantly. and nauseous with a lack of hunger (which doesn't help my hypoglycemia). and i've vomited a bit. i mean i'm pretty sure it's from the withdrawal and not from the need to take the medication because it certainly wasn't this bad when i was at a lower dose however long ago that was. it really really sucks, and i've already had a few panic attacks. i also feel like i've been more sensitive to bright lights with headaches bordering on migraines. and i've been dizzy and sleepy.

1. after night one of having two beers, i felt okay the next morning. maybe a little stomach upset, but that seemed more hangover-related than anything else.

2. after night two of having somewhere between 2-3 drinks, i'm not feeling so well. i think i'm experiencing withdrawal, as i take my medication in the evening. when i first began taking lamotrigine, i experienced weird ""shakey"" or panicky sensations/dizziness/lack of balance at the end of every day for about 5 days in a row.

 i have been given 4 options for treatment, but my psychiatrist has a strong preference for the first two drugs listed below. **does anyone have any experience with any of the following medications?** i'm particularly worried about drowsiness and symptoms that will worsen my inability to concentrate. 

* lamotrigine (my preferred option so far based on research)
* aripiprazole (i was on this aged 18 and came off due to lethargy and drowsiness)
* lithium (apprehensive about this as i do not want to gain any more weight)
* sodium valproate (i am not planning on starting a family with my partner for another 8-10 years so pregnancy isn't something to worry about currently).

thanks in advance and i hope you're all having a positive day &lt;3",1613645003,FALSE,BPD,2021-02-18 10:43:23,"Medication Choices hi everyone,

What happened to psychs who do therapy?,"i started seeing a psychiatrist a couple of years back, at a major university, and none of the doctors do any sort of therapy. you go in, tell them your symptoms, and they prescribe you all sorts of things that may make you better, may make you worse. they have zero interest in communicating with any therapists, or even ask how therapy is going, just prescribe, prescribe, prescribe. of the 20 to 30 medications they've had me try, 4 work, and so many of the others caused symptoms that made me feel worse than i ever have. ironically, the ones that work are all ones i pushed for (their recommendation against these) after researching most successful meds online. they won't give me a prescription for the klonopin i was on for 9 years (had been prescribed by gp until retirement) that actually worked 'because it's dangerous'. they've had me try meds so dangerous that my brain felt like it was shrinking into itself and i've blacked out repeatedly, had symptoms of severe suicidal ideation, and physical symptoms so bad i couldn't move, yet klonopin (which worked with no symptoms) is the ""dangerous"" one. i have meds to control the symptoms of the meds that control the symptoms of others... 
i'm furious with them for their complete disregard for my quality of life. it's all about how many expensive meds they can get me hooked on.

The Summation and Conclusion of my existence: I am the architect of my own downfall,"brace yourselves, this is going to be a long boi  


24/m  
(keep in mind im having a severe identity/mental health crisis, and possibly dissociating/psychotic. im skeptical that even my perceptions of memories arent reality)  


it all started from the last ""vivid memory"" (if its real) that i have.  
my parents fighting.   
my mom for most of my childhood/adulthood was a neurotic, neglectful and a workaholic (attention wise, she never showed me any empathy or validation unless it was based on performance or benefited her from what i could remember, only spoiled me with toys to shut me up.) also claimed she ""knew something was wrong from the age of two, apparently i was too insufferable for a 2-4 year old.  
tells me now that she was none of those things and that it was my dad who was conditional.  
my dad from what i could remember was overtly emotional, hyper empathetic, high functioning drug addict. nowadays he's become cynical, skeptical, covertly narcissistic, dependent and extremely stubborn, and still using. growing up he always committed to things, but always was super late on doing them if he ever did.   
polar opposites.  
my mom took me in the middle of the night at 3ys old away from my dad, idk the real reason why, both people have different takes.   
most of my life is a complete blur, i cannot remember anything important until 12-13yrs old, even then every memory i have even nowadays is spotty.  
i know that the only social connections i had consistently growing up were family members, i had no friends that i remember (except brief ones) until highschool. kids avoided me as the weird kid, i was also called ""future school shooter"" a few times. girls never asked me out (i found out later that they were convinced not to by other people because of my ""weirdness"").   
i was also prescribed lithium at age 5.  
risperidal at age 7.  
i was on 60mg of ritalin w/10mg of lamictal a day between ages 6-16, made me fall asleep in class.  
my dad says one summer i came to visit with 13 different scripts at once.  
i dont know what my formal diagnosis was as a kid, they had me pinned with bipolar, odd, and adhd, night terrors, and even were considering aspergers at one point.  
idk in therapy for years as a kid, never talked to them about anything ever, always deflected to something else.  
at 18, i graduated highschool. straight edge kid. never used drugs, had gotten drunk, nor smoked cigarettes. started gaining some confidence back. started singing open mic locally to get out and socialize. had a car, was going to college, had a job. was off my adhd meds for 2 years prior.  


enter my first relationship. absolutely amazing, perfect, the one that got away. i was so passionate, bought gifts often, went on cute dates, the ideal notebook scenario.  
half way through the relationship (which lasted a year) i end up getting my wisdom teeth pulled, and given a 30-day script of vicodin (unbeknownst to my drug virgin mind at the time was a narcotic) took it as prescribed, was hooked in 2 weeks.  


i became less empathetic, more withdrawn, my relationships, my job, my degree all burning down around me, with me too numb to care.  
she leaves me because i'm hurting her by not being present.  
after she leaves, and to this very day, i feel broken.  
i get deeper into drugs, while still maintaining jobs here and there never lasting longer than a few months.   
my drug experimentation having fewer and fewer boundaries, lying to myself that its functional and that i love the research of the drugs and how they work. (to try and appease my logical side i think)  
i had another relationship about 6 months later lasted 3 months, she was amazing, loving, did a lot for me. i ghosted when things got real, i didnt know how to empathize when things in her life got tough.  
i went on dates frequently after my first relationship ended, they rarely went past the first date. i still had only slept with 2 people by that point, never had cheated, never had a one night stand.  
i think its because i got too emotionally involved so quickly.

keep in mind this entire time i was actively self-harming, somewhat-suicidal, and making extremely reckless and dangerous decisions (just more on the dl back then), and frequently testing my limits with whatever drug i was doing at the time. 

i was constantly moving back and forth between my mom's and dad's houses whenever things got stressful (wisconsin vs arizona, long distance to move frequently). what can i say, i was used to it, as a kid i was raised and went to school in wisco, but visited arizona every summer and every other winter.  


it wasnt until my first inpatient stint at 21 or 22 that i was diagnosed with bpd. every behavior pattern mentioned in the book i bought was relatable to more than a handful of my experiences. it felt like i was reading an autobiography. for once i felt like i wasnt crazy, and alone.  


the drug use continued, but was somewhat manageable, until i started stealing money from my mom, and the drug use also turned from coping mechanism to a tool for self-harm (nssi).  
   
even when times got tough, i usually made it through, by a combination of support group of friends, concerts, my car to get away when i needed to, etc.  


flash forward to now. this year destroyed me, a good relationship, my sanity, and my willpower.  
pre-quarantine in december last year i had my first drug od from fentanyl laced percs.   
(narcaned 2x, aspirated blood into my lungs, was on life support for days) it was the first time i felt like my family or anyone gave a shit about me. heres where it goes downhill.  


when lockdown starts, my car is broken, my once social connections to reality are mainly severed, it didnt help that all of my friends are 2000mi away from me.  
i started experimenting with meth at this point in feb or march. because i found it in my dad's room on one occasion at random. i knew what it was, even though i hadnt done it.  
lured me in with the focus, mania, and dissociation.   
i ended up spending most of the year inside stimmed out of my mind, doing too large of quantities of the substance, but never going full tweak mode. always had anti-psychotics and emergency meds on hand, inc bp cuff and pulse reader. (moms side of family has always been in the medical field loved the subject since i was a kid, might be why im such a hypochondriac)  


as the months go on, my obsession with the human condition, my researching of how drugs work on the brain, led me to become obsessed with finding out what causes the human condition on a physiological/neurochemical level. learning about hormones, neurotransmitters, fight or flight etc.  
my philosophies becoming more cynical and nihilistic by the day.  
trading emotions and emotional control for mania and logic.  
i discovered discord, which has helped me cope significantly.  


tl;dr lets get to the point.  


i feel hopeless, completely devoid of motivation/passion for anything outside of my music related hobbies (even those im losing passion in). im convinced the repeated drug self-harming, is going to kill me fairly soon whether intentional or not. the drug has ruined what little color my life has left, i have been in multiple potentially life threatening medical situations from it willingly, i knowingly take large enough doses to cause harm, but never enough where it will 100% kill me right then.   
i have even less emotional control then before, im more numb to things, i cant even force myself to leave the house. im hearing faint voices that i can tell arent real, occasional laughter.  
intrusive thoughts are getting worse (even seeing scenes of me hurting myself and others, often in graphic detail). im more aggressive. im having night terrors.   
on a bad day im crying and screaming in a ball on the ground (literally).  
on a average day, i have full-body/joint aches, and headaches, with an incalculable amount of mental and emotional stress for no reason at any given time. which makes me do things that feed the cycle more.  


\-im aware most of this could easily be drug induced, doesnt make it any less real to me.  


the best way i can describe it is, there is a complete and total dissociation between my logic and emotional sides. im either all logic, cold, uncaring, numb, or overtly emotional. i could swear its another personality almost.   
in short, im a hopelessly drug addicted, hypocritical, overtly emotional, overtly-analytical, overtly-logical, intelligent, broken, suicidal, paranoid, possibly psychotic, depressed, unmotivated, dissociated 24yr old.  


my last therapist dropped me earlier this year when i started using. my final diagnosis was: low functioning bpd, w/ comorbid bipolar ii, generalized anxiety disorder, and adhd (with substance abuse disorder).  


my life is in shambles, im desperate, i dont know what to do. im dissociating while writing this.   
i dont wanna die, but im not convinced yet that im making it to 27.

trading emotions and emotional control for mania and logic.  
i discovered discord, which has helped me cope significantly.  


tl;dr lets get to the point.  


i feel hopeless, completely devoid of motivation/passion for anything outside of my music related hobbies (even those im losing passion in). im convinced the repeated drug self-harming, is going to kill me fairly soon whether intentional or not. the drug has ruined what little color my life has left, i have been in multiple potentially life threatening medical situations from it willingly, i knowingly take large enough doses to cause harm, but never enough where it will 100% kill me right then.   
i have even less emotional control then before, im more numb to things, i cant even force myself to leave the house. im hearing faint voices that i can tell arent real, occasional laughter.  
intrusive thoughts are getting worse (even seeing scenes of me hurting myself and others, often in graphic detail). im more aggressive. im having night terrors.   
on a bad day im crying and screaming in a ball on the ground (literally).  
on a average day, i have full-body/joint aches, and headaches, with an incalculable amount of mental and emotional stress for no reason at any given time. which makes me do things that feed the cycle more.  


\-im aware most of this could easily be drug induced, doesnt make it any less real to me.  


the best way i can describe it is, there is a complete and total dissociation between my logic and emotional sides. im either all logic, cold, uncaring, numb, or overtly emotional. i could swear its another personality almost.   
in short, im a hopelessly drug addicted, hypocritical, overtly emotional, overtly-analytical, overtly-logical, intelligent, broken, suicidal, paranoid, possibly psychotic, depressed, unmotivated, dissociated 24yr old.  


my last therapist dropped me earlier this year when i started using. my final diagnosis was: low functioning bpd, w/ comorbid bipolar ii, generalized anxiety disorder, and adhd (with substance abuse disorder).  


my life is in shambles, im desperate, i dont know what to do. im dissociating while writing this.   
i dont wanna die, but im not convinced yet that im making it to 27.

Dont wanna die but cant stand being alive??,"sometimes i just find it hard to wrap my head around this whole living thing. i'm a fairly religious person so thats the only reason im still holding on but quite honestly, i've been feeling beyond exhausted lately. i just get extreme mood swings where im super happy for a few minutes-hours then i instantly crash and feel so weird. i don't know how to describe this feeling but its sort of like a feeling of doom, like everything is black, like theres no way out and im trapped in 'here'. 

&amp;#x200b;

when i feel like this i tend to force myself to sleep because i know that being awake will make me go extremely manic at some point and i'll do things i regret (like cut or get super irritable). i just don't know how to cope with this anymore. i feel like i've tried every single thing but regardless im the most unstable person ever.

&amp;#x200b;

i just cant seem to have any sort of baseline when it comes to my emotions. im either super low, super high, or simply numb to the point where i can't stand my own existence. i've been on medication since november - mainly for my bulimia but its meant to help with this too apparently. i'm currently taking zoloft (25mg daily) and lamictal (a mood stabilizer) every night.

&amp;#x200b;

despite all of this, my mood seems to be anything but stable. i feel like i'm slowly losing my mind. i just don't have any control over how i feel anymore. everytime i remember the fact that i wont be able to sleep and escape my life since i already slept for like 14 hours today, my heart starts beating so fast and the sense of doom and fear kicks in. i don't know why i feel so trapped, kind of like im suffocating and sleeping is my only way out??",1586020554,FALSE,BPD,2020-04-04 17:15:54,"Dont wanna die but cant stand being alive?? sometimes i just find it hard to wrap my head around this whole living thing. i'm a fairly religious person so thats the only reason im still holding on but quite honestly, i've been feeling beyond exhausted lately. i just get extreme mood swings where im super happy for a few minutes-hours then i instantly crash and feel so weird. i don't know how to describe this feeling but its sort of like a feeling of doom, like everything is black, like theres no way out and im trapped in 'here'.

i can cut this down to just one, low alcohol percentage (%5) beer and be okay with that. but the idea of not being able to drink at all makes me sad :(

53 yo and newly diagnosed- scared but trying to overcome,"i've been reading reddit for years, but decided to join and post in this sub due to being diagnosed at 53 with bpd. i am in therapy and take lamictal, latuda, and xanax, due to a dual diagnosis of bipolar disorder. i feel like, right now, the only folks i can discuss this with are other people with borderline. i have always had the classic criteria for bpd (borderline), minus cutting. i feel sad that i was not diagnosed with this years ago, when i was younger, so my life would have, maybe,  been much better and less stressful. no one i knew ever mentioned bpd, let alone my family members- first generation immigrant grandparents, no therapy sought for anything. now i see- the explosions, changing jobs , boredom, approval-seeking (from semi-strangers!), fights, tempestuous relationship issues- all of it. i feel like a door has opened, and also ashamed, for some reason

i am seeking online support due to the sudden insight into what has caused me many problems intrapersonally and professionally over the years of my life. it is taking me time to absorb this- it has been about one year since my diagnosis of borderline and bipolar. i am really examining now my responses to things that, in the past, would have caused me to quit- impulsivity at jobs. emptiness. it has hit me like a truck. i also have ptsd from working in a very violent, chaotic workplace, and this situation, the ptsd, brought me to therapy and a wonderful psychiatrist, and psychologist. they both work together, and it was the psychologist who finally got the borderline diagnosis right. i also suffer from panic attacks, depression and anxiety. i'm  not sure if there is interplay between borderline and panic/depression/ anxiety.

why i decided to go online and join a reddit borderline group is for support, listening, and talking to people who have been in this situation. i have a job that is very stressful, but i need my salary and my very good health benefits. there are times i feel like an alien that, at my age, i should not be acting like someone with borderline. that i am dumb. that people are judging me and finding me woefully not up-to-par. that i am losing my mind at times. menopause may be making this worse, perhaps. i really feel i have no one to talk to , other than my therapists, about this. so here i am on reddit. i have been with my so since i was 30 yo, but still feel that my feelings are not understood, as they would be with others with borderline.

i was able to function quite well most of my life. for the last few years, however, i feel like i had a nervous breakdown and  have days like i feel i can barely function at work. i have taken two, 3-month loa from work. i felt better. have been considering getting on ssdi. the attorney told me to chart my moods and other issues (not sure how long) and then see if he can make the case for me getting ssdi. i am not sure how this is going to play out, which is also stressful. i am lucky to have a job, frankly, but then feel guilty for feeling the stress of my job is making this all worse.  being on ssdi would mean less stress, but i would have a drop in salary, but i think it would be worth it.

Radical personality change after starting antidepressants?,"hi everyone! really hoping this is the right flair, first time posting here. for reference, i was diagnosed with bpd in august of 2020 and started medications (venlafaxine and lamotrigine) shortly after. 

i used to be very reserved in public but much more emotional with people i knew. i had a lot of suppressed anger, often spiraling into long angry rants. despite that, i was generally downtrodden and angry more at myself than anybody else; i would generally feel upset, being suicidal at my worst moments and merely content at my best. all this resulted in me shying away from a lot of interactions due to feeling like i ruin everything i touch.

that radically changed after i started taking medications. over time, i became a lot more confident. guilt got replaced with regret/embarassment, with me sometimes even becoming flippant over any mistakes. anger remained, but it no longer turned into sadness and it spilled outwards instead. i feel like a great part of my morality just... vanished, as if it was dependant on me feeling bad.

i lashed out at her and got angry because she ""ignored"" me for those couple hours, then i suddenly broke into sobbing and crying and i apologized to her and. i just feel so bad about this but at least she seems to understand. shes mentally ill herself too, not bpd but still.

i'm really frustrated, honestly...

Can't manage to stay on my meds,"unlike a lot of people, my problem is not that i want to be off my meds. i *want* to be on them; i need to be on them. but for some reason i find it incredibly difficult to maintain a regular regime of taking them.

i'm on 80mg of prozac and i think 20mg of lamotrigine daily. i have struggled maintaining consistency -- i can manage a few weeks to a few months of being on them, and then i'll miss a day or two and just go off. 

it's so frustrating because it's such an easy thing. it literally takes one minute to swallow some pills. the lamictal pill is an uncomfortable shape and can be hard to swallow -- but that can't be the whole reason, can it?!

i got a little pill box where you can put each day's pills in their own little container. but after i go through all the pills for the week (it has 7 mini containers) i find it difficult/tedious to restock. so i don't. and then i don't have easy access to the day's pills, and then i don't take them.

there has to be something deeper to this than just laziness, right? the only thing i can think of that might apply is this desire i have to spice things up, make my life interesting. the meds work really well at allowing me to function, but a part of me finds this drama-less, predictable life boring. and if i go off the meds, who knows what will happen!!!

but that's just a little thought; i really do want to be on them. and i can already feel some symptoms of bpd that the meds control resurfacing. it's freaking me out. how can i get back on my meds -- and stay on them? anyone else ever dealt with this issue?

I feel like I have lost the ability to feel anything at all anymore.,"i am constantly numb and empty. if i don't feel that, then i feel depression and a heavy weight on my chest. i'm really struggling to discover what the cause of this is and if anything is effecting it, or whether it's just a bpd thing and i've got to deal with it. do any of you just feel... robotic?? i have been on 20mg of citalopram for 3 years, but past few months have lowered the dosage to 10mg as i suspected the ssri was numbing me out. it's made a little difference i think, but not really. other than that i have been on 75mg of lamotrigine for nearly 2 years and i feel like that is doing me just fine. the thing i'm struggling with the most is that i feel like i cant feel anything for anyone or anything; as in when i look at the people in my life i know i love i feel... nothing. empty. it makes me feel like i don't care and i don't have any energy to give to the people i love. i feel nothing when i do/think about my hobbies and passions - my creativity is my driving force in life and i just feel so disconnected. i also have absolutely no sex drive or sexuality at the moment which is a huge issue. like with everything else, i just feel nothing for sex at the moment. no desire, no drive, no sense of my sexuality in my own head. i'm naturally a very sexual person and used to masturbate but i don't anymore and me and my boyfriend rarely do anything sexual with eachother. i just feel nothing towards life. i am going through the motions every day.. waking up, putting makeup on, going to work, cooking, hanging out with my boyfriend.. and while i'm not 100% despondent all the time it always always feels like there is a this big fat empty soul sucking void in me filled with just numbness. 

&amp;#x200b;

Feel like a failure because I'm not in a relationship,"a little background: female, 29, was diagnosed with depression at 19 and bpd at 24. i'm taking wellbutrin and lamictal daily and klonopin as needed.  my symptoms have gotten a lot better since starting meds but i still have my moments.

i guess i'm a ""high-functioning"" pwbpd.  i finished grad school, have a rewarding career with a really good income, and i've been at the same job for almost 4 years now.  i'm from nyc and can finally afford to live here alone and not be struggling.  all of these things are great and really good accomplishments, but the fact i'm not in a relationship almost negates everything.

i have only been in one relationship in my entire life that was on-and-off from 2007-2009. i have had so many one night stands and hookups that i've lost count and currently have a fwb that i see regularly and is the closest thing i have had to a relationship (he's in an open marriage so the arrangement doesn't allow for anything more for me). i want a relationship so bad but i know we're so hard to deal with. i'm scared to even try to get into one because i don't want the pain that comes along with getting attached to someone when they're going to leave you. i know being alone can sometimes be the best for us.

but everyone i know is in a relationship and they all seem so happy. i hate being on the subway and seeing couples touching each other's leg or kissing, idk how to describe it but i almost get angry for no reason. i just want to know to what all that stuff feels like since i haven't had a boyfriend in over a decade. 

i'm turning 30 in august and i feel like such a failure when i see my friends getting engaged and married and starting families. i know it's irrational because i have accomplished a lot, but i still think there's no point to any of this if there's no one to share my life/happiness with.

need some career advice please regarding my bpd,"hey fellow bpd peeps!

i have pretty much made up my mind but wanted to make a post on here cuz sometimes i cant trust myself. so, quickly, been cutting since 6th grade, suicide attempts, drug abuse, isolation, finally got diagnosed at age 33 with bpd. straight male btw who is almost 35 currently. things are a lot better than they were pre diagnosis, on 3 meds (lamotrigine, abilify generic, prozac generic) now, no self harm over a year, no opiates for 3-4, even met a girl that hung out and slept with me for a few weeks. which was a big deal when you had gone ten years without even a kiss, she was great, it ended and messed with me but so much less than i thought it would, mostly due to her being a fantastic human being about it.

anyway, ive been working in my industry for almost 15 years and slowly working my way up. bpd has really fucked with me in the past, but i thought now that i was doing better i was ready to take a promotion and go up the ladder a ring. sales job. ive done it before and quit cause of bpd and stress but i thought i could do it this time.

now im pretty sure i cant. the stress is killer. i wake up and feel sick. ive been drinking way more, smoking way more, doing whatever i can to escape feeling this way and its shutting me down. my job has a lot of freedom and very little structure and a lot of things to keep track of and be organized about.... and guess who doesnt have many of those life skills. im digging myself a hole and now i want to go back to my old position within the company (if i can, if not i dont know what ill do) so i can maintain my good insurance and go to therapy and try and get things locked down again.

[M/22] How do I get over my ex?,"hi guys!

&amp;#x200b;

   so, pretty much my entire life i was pretty fucked up, most of the time i was depressed, i dropped out of uni then started again, never worked a day in my life, ever since i moved away from my mom at 18, i've been a failure. last august a girl i knew from my hometown highschool reconnected with me ( she used to be the gf of one of my former best friends, i was friends with the girl too but they had a bad breakup so we haven't talked since ). we went out to a bar, and it was instant love from the both of us. we immediately jumped into a relationship and it was really intense, the we both said "" i love you "" like 50 times on the first day kind of intense. we really seemed like a 100% match on every level, i thought  we are soulmates. and for the first time in my life... i felt happy and okay. i could function as a normal person. 

&amp;#x200b;

here are some boring relationship details, you can skip this if you want, it's just a bit more context:

&amp;#x200b;

   so, pretty much my entire life i was pretty fucked up, most of the time i was depressed, i dropped out of uni then started again, never worked a day in my life, ever since i moved away from my mom at 18, i've been a failure. last august a girl i knew from my hometown highschool reconnected with me ( she used to be the gf of one of my former best friends, i was friends with the girl too but they had a bad breakup so we haven't talked since ). we went out to a bar, and it was instant love from the both of us. we immediately jumped into a relationship and it was really intense, the we both said "" i love you "" like 50 times on the first day kind of intense. we really seemed like a 100% match on every level, i thought  we are soulmates. and for the first time in my life... i felt happy and okay. i could function as a normal person.

Question about Lamictal/Lamotrigine,"hello everyone! this is my first time posting to /r/bpd, but i have been lurking here for quite a while. 
i was recently prescribed lamotrigine (brand name is lamictal as stated in title) and have only been taking it for two days now. i have pretty severe anxiety, which is often triggered by health related concerns. i made the mistake of reading the side effects list for this new prescription, and suffice to say, i am severely freaked out.

basically, i am debating whether or not weathering this anxiety is worth it. so my questions to anyone here who is prescribed lamotrigine are first, what kind of positive effects/results did you see from taking this drug and how long did they take to manifest? and second, what negative side effects (if any) did you experience and did they subside/how long did it take them to subside.

i hope someone has some information that can help me with this decision... i really want to do everything in my power to get better, but this anxiety is really difficult to handle so it's gotta be worth it.

Medicine to become socially functional again,"i've been to therapy for two years and i still don't feel any less crushed when i try to socialize for once. i don't socialize at all. like sometimes i am feeling great and confident for a couple days and reach out to people but get hurt in the process because of rejection and withdraw again because i have to focus on my safety. being with people my age who don't deal with shitty mental health is a huge trigger for me. like it's hard to explain, but it's not even social anxiety anymore, it's more like i'm tired of spending nights and days trying to calm myself afterwards.

idk i really hate the medicines i tried so far. i don't have a full blown depressive episode this time either. like i was almost hypomanic a day or two ago. but at this point, idk what else to do. i can wait for my confidence and euphoria to come back and try to use it to fix my life but it just never stays long enough. however, i really don't know how i would stay on a medicine for long enough either, like if it fucks up my sexuality completely (always happened before) and i actually feel better, i have no clue how i would stop myself from going off it once again.

is this stupid? i feel like if i don't have a sexuality anymore because antidepressants zap it i have even less reason to socialize, but it's not like i'm actually getting with other people due to always getting burnt in the process so it's not like i would really lose anything except the ability to masturbate?

Oh Canada....,"okay, so i have bpd and genderalized anxiety disorder as well as bipolar type two (hypo mania)

so heres the thing, my psych took me off of my anti depressants because it would cause hypo-manic episodes (which it did, and rip my 300$ ;n; )

i was put on lithium and kept my other meds, now im on: lithium 1050mg, lamotrigine 100mg, olazapine 5mg and birth control.

with this med combo my mania has been under control and so has my depression.

but heres the kicker

my anxiety is hectic. its starting to become to the point of debilitating again like what is was when i first got diagnosed with a mental illness (gad). i nearly missed a college class today because i wanted to go home and hide and do some other stuff. spoiler: went to class with teary eyed anyway from a panic attack.

i see my doctor tomorrow and i'm thinking im going to confront him about putting me on cannabis, because its legal here and a lot of my friends who have severe anxiety started using it for themselves recreationally and it helped them with their anxiety. like they would smoke or take the oil in the morning and be fine all day. some of them who i knew had severe severe anxiety, like hospitalized anxiety, sometimes need to take a little bit at night to sleep. but what do you guys think of this, would this be a good idea?

so heres the thing, my psych took me off of my anti depressants because it would cause hypo-manic episodes (which it did, and rip my 300$ ;n; )

i was put on lithium and kept my other meds, now im on: lithium 1050mg, lamotrigine 100mg, olazapine 5mg and birth control.

with this med combo my mania has been under control and so has my depression.

but heres the kicker

my anxiety is hectic. its starting to become to the point of debilitating again like what is was when i first got diagnosed with a mental illness (gad). i nearly missed a college class today because i wanted to go home and hide and do some other stuff. spoiler: went to class with teary eyed anyway from a panic attack.

How does the lamotrigine headspace feel like?,"i've been trying to understand lamotrigine in terms of how it makes people feel like but i haven't found any answer that suffices. people say that it makes them stabler, that it makes them go from -50 to 50 instead of -100 to 100, etc, etc. but what does the drug feel like? 

for example, i can tell the following about diazepam:

&gt;it makes things have a smoother edge, everything's calm and your muscles relaxes because everything you thought the matter suddenly doesn't. it's a pleasurable calm but doesn't have a blissful sensation but more of a comfortable numbness, similar to alcohol but without the jittery, but more like you're sitting on a cloud. the drug responds linearly and rapidly, so if you take 20mg of a benzo you'll fell twice as good as with 10mg.

or with lsd:

&gt;the walls around start to breathe and there's color everywhere, inside and outside, you're taken to a special world that even though everything's about the same as before, you look at the world from several other perspectives, like you're a newborn and you're taking a fresh look at life. sometimes it feels good, others you're forced to look at things you didn't want to and can be a tough ride if you try to force and not accept the experience. you feel like you're above the mundane reality and in touch with the divine world, but it can be heaven or hell depending on your mental set.

there are thousands of drug reports like this on erowid, both for legal and illegal, but [only a few for lamotrigine](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_pharms_lamotrigine_.shtml) and none of them talk about how does the drug feel like.

Medical Marijuana for BPD &amp; GAD?,"despite being on buspirone and lamotrigine (which have significantly improved quality of life) i still find that often my anxiety severely reduces appetite, even makes me sick if i attempt to eat. it doesn't help i've recovered from anorexia, bulimia but still have anorexic tendencies. i've been told that even when stoned i do not seem stoned at all, just friendlier and less freaked out. it doesn't damage quality of work and i still function at work and around home as needed. my boss recently found out i smoke (we've known each other 5 years, i work in a gas station) and although he won't fire me he doesn't approve saying it makes for a bad image even though in our state it is legal. 


is it possible to talk to my healthcare provider or psychiatrist about potentially being approved for a medical marijuana card, or is this a bad idea with how bpd tendencies can be suppressed by the use of marijuana 'preventing growth'? i tried to quit per my psychiatrist's recommendation but every time the buspirone stand alone doesn't curb off enough of the anxiety and i cannot eat without getting sick unless using marijuana. i don't like being stoned, i like that it gets rid of my pain and slows down racing thoughts. i never use a bong or dabs, just a small pipe. i've been smoking daily for so many years now and feel a bit cornered about quitting marijuana. i don't think it's a good idea, i know the psychiatrist is much more educated than myself and he's likely right about bpd and marijuana use not being a good idea but without it i feel like i'm a cancer patient.

they've been putting me through bloodwork, scans, etc. to find what is wrong. i've a referral to a rheumatologist for symptoms of early onset ra -- hypermobility, throbbing joints, restless nights from pain, bad ibs (25 and i have to sometimes *run* to the bathroom in a matter of a minute out of nowhere).

The road to my diagnosis,"hello everyone, first and foremost i'd like to say that if i'm not posting this to the right place, to feel free to take it down. 

now that that's out of the way, this is my first post so excuse me for any missteps. 

anyway, onto my story (i'll keep this as short and concise as possible... maybe bullet points?) 

when i was in elementary school (think grade six or seven) i encountered abuse for the first time. it scarred me to this day, and i won't go into much detail in this post (since it's its own story). i ended up having to go to court in grade ten, and my family sort of fell apart. through this entire time, i was constantly invalidated and questioned as to whether it happened. 

after i was done highschool, i ended up being kicked out even though i really wasn't that bad of a teen (at least in my eyes. i never smoked, drank, or did any drugs) and i ended up in a close to five year abusive relationship. during that time i also went to university for a while, and that's what i got diagnosed with manic depression type 2 (or bipolar type 2). 

i managed to leave that toxic, abusive relationship in part thanks to the rock in my life who was my friend at that point when a lot of my friends lived back home and were a solid hour and a half away (i don't drive). anyway, i started seeing a new family physician who referred me to the psychologist under his practice and when i met up with him, he told me i had been improperly diagnosed by the first psychiatrist. he's the one that told me i had borderline personality issues, a more -mild- version of bpd. he wanted to put me on lamictal (lamotrigine), but i refused it since i had other things to take into consideration too. 

it's been about two years since this all came to a head, and i have some really bad days, but i'm doing my best to maintain a healthy mind set and work on parts of me that can be problematic. i do things, or say things at times that i don't mean to and it really hurts me and those around me that i care most about. in due time, i'm sure i'll likely do some therapy but since my living condition will be up in the air soon, i have to play the waiting game. for now, i've been trying to tackle things with books on better understanding my condition. 

i hope you're all having a good start to the week, and i'm sorry about the wall but i figure if anyone would be able to relate, it'd be you guys. thanks for taking the time to read this. &lt;3

i tried meditation, cbt, yoga, medication, etc. and some helped but the constant mood swings were always there fucking me up. two months ago after another failed relationship i remembered people in this sub talking about lamotrigine, i decided to investigate and it seemed to be effective. the more i investigated, the cooler it seemed to be so i booked an appointment with a psychiatrist and he prescribed me the drug.

i started taking it 6 weeks ago and have been increasing 25mg every 2 weeks, had a couple of small blisters but it went away. despite that i didn't feel anything, until yesterday.

so, in the beginning of the week i started to talk with my ex with who i went no-contact... and yesterday as i was talking to her i started to imagine her being with another guy and in the past this would be enough for set me off the rest of the day but yesterday was different - i was hurt and jealous by imagining that buuut it was only for a couple of seconds and it went away! i was able to carry on with work as normally and didn't have that grey aura surrounding me for the rest of the day. it was amazing! instead of being upset, i was happy.

now i'm really hopeful that i'll be able to live a normal life, that's all i wanted. i know that medication alone isn't enough and i'll have to keep practicing the cbt and try to keep a balanced life in order to have some normalcy but not being dragged back and forth and smashed against the walls by my moods everyday is like 90% of the bpd is solved.",1509811815,FALSE,BPD,2017-11-04 16:10:15,"Hooray!

Misdiagnosis and lamictal,"my therapist has been talking about borderline for a while now, and today she gave me a diagnosis. it’s a little ambiguous, and i think it’s because of how hesitant i am about it. i feel weird claiming that label because i know of other people with bpd who struggle with diff things way more than i do. but i also see where she’s coming from because i have so many of the dsm criteria to a very severe degree. i know a lot of people think that bpd isn’t a spectrum/ambiguous. but this is just what i’ve been told.
anyway, i’m on lamictal right now, because before the whole bpd thing my psychiatrist (different from my therapist) thought i had bipolar 2 because i told her my aunt had it (turns out my aunt is actually borderline, not bipolar). it seems to possibly be helping me day-to-day?? 
i’d like to hear from people here who are on lamictal and how it’s helped you.

finally i feel kind of hesitant about the diagnosis because past therapists have given me so many wrong diagnoses. pmdd, bipolar, cyclothymia, anxiety disorders. the only correct one has been major depression. i feel like i seem like the boy who cried wolf with all these diagnoses. i’d like to hear from people who have a long history of misdiagnosis?

An original song about my BPD journey - finding an outlet saved my life,"its taken me 10 years to share this song to other bpd suffers.  mainly because i can now manage my bpd (and numerous other issues such as imaginary friends, thats another story) to the point i'm married, in control and with no one whom i socialise with really having the slightest incline i would of ever been a bpd suffer, apart from the scars.  i gave up counting after 300, which cover the majority of my upper body, the largest covering the length of my chest to upper stomach, all self inflicted, including the 7 attempts on my own life.   most are now hidden under tattoo's, apart from the few that have caused nerve damage and are simply to painful to ink over. 

now days though i just brush off the scars and tell people i was in a car accident.  people that know me now never put a second thought into it because i am to a degree normal.  its taken me so long to write this and share this song under this context because i was scared of people finding out and i am ashamed of my past, i know i shouldn't be, but i am.  i had never used reddit until a couple of days ago and stumbled across this group.  i haven't noticed many posts on how people cope, so i thought i'd share what worked for me.

firstly, get professional help.  yes, easy to say.  it took a court order for me to see a shrink.  at the time i remember wanting to disown my family for even suggesting to see someone.  i hated every second of it and they forced me on lamictal.  i have been on lamictal for 10 years and whilst it is notoriously hard to get off, why would i.  it didn't stop my swings but it slowed things down so i could approach decisions rationally.  it may not be for you, but honestly, it is a key ingredient that saved my life and allowed me to have relationships and hold down a job.

second, and to me the most import - **outlets**.  this is something i don't see many people delve into.  during my bpd days i had many outlets.  alcohol, drugs and all the sex i could have. then of course the number one being self-harm.  it made my inner pain become a physical pain and shifted the focus from the screaming within my head to the burning of what i had just opened up.  this is not a good thing. once medicated i was able to rationalise this and turn to other outlets

music was always in my life, and it quickly became an alternative way of escaping my inner turmoil.  creating music just soothed me.  music never judged me, hung up on me, walked away from me, called me a fucking lunatic, called the cops etc.  it was always there and i could always just pick up a guitar and find 30-40 minutes of peace.  music is the love of my life because it saved my soul.  if you are a musician with bpd or bipolar ( i was diagnosed with both, apparently) use music to free yourself, even for a minute. 

however music didn't fix everything, i still had an abundance of energy and sometimes anger (this is still whilst on lamictal).  so guess what, i started fighting... in a controlled manner.  i took up muay thai and last few years brazilian jiu jitsu.  physical outlets are an absolute must.  i can not tell you how important training is to me when it comes to controlling my bpd.  having a bad day? want to beat the shit out of something? 30 mins none stop on a heavy bag will solve all of that.  physical outlets are even more important if you are a bpd suffer with a high sex drive (mine was unbearable).  fighting sports releases all of those unsatisfied pent up feelings, at least for me. 

i am so lucky that i found these outlets.  the medication alone was not enough, but with creative and physical outlets i could start to put a life together. its become a beautiful life, with beautiful people and memories. 

i hope that whom ever happens to read this finds their outlet, whether its music, fighting, drawing, horse back riding, writing, cycling, rock climbing, body building, aquarium keeping, hunting, fishing, pottery, poetry, religion... the list is endless.  just please find one.

so, here's the song that sums up my bpd.  i hope its enjoyed.

"abandoning ppl first before they get to, chameleon effect and mirroring","helllooooo! i have bpd, ocd, ptsd, anxiety and depression (im the full package!)  
i’m currently taking lamotrigine 200mg and lexapro 40mg. i use to take sertraline 100mg but after a year i started to struggle with the nightmares, so discontinued use.

does anybody use people, knowing that you’ll soon abandon them once you’ve gotten what you want from them, before they get the chance to abandon you? just because you know the friendship won’t last long, so you might as well take advantage of it while ya can. it’s like these friendships have a deadline, a time set in my head.

instead of going into frantic efforts to prevent being abandoned, i abandon them first. because of this, i have unstable relationships and friendships, they don’t last very long because i simply just ghost them. it gets lonely. but, i’d rather be lonely and use this technique than live in constant fear of abandonment and mistrust.

i tend to have many small groups of friends, as opposed to having one big group, and i keep them seperate. this makes it easier to ghost people when i want to. i can ghost one group of friends, but keep another, just so i’m not completely lonely. this is also a handy technique!

why why why the fuck would you have children if you’re just going to criticize them and lie about them behind their back to family??? i did something i shouldn’t have—read my mother’s text messages—and found something that simultaneously made me feel like utter shit while also sublimely pissing me off.

a little background: my family life is...complicated, to put it mildly. i have my bpd issues as well as physical complications that keep me from working, so my daughter and i live with my parents, which benefits us all because my brother has downs, and i help out with his care. the past eight months have been hellacious on me—back in september, my psychiatrist moved 20 miles away and i don’t drive, the bus/trolley trip there was taxing to me mentally and physically, so my only option was to go through kaiser to find a new shrink. well, kaiser has one mental health location for all of the greater san diego area, and if you want to make an appointment, you’re looking at a 4 to 5 month wait. fine. whatever. so i finally get an appointment in march. i see the dr for about 40 minutes, she decides to take me off my lamictal (sure, great, it wasn’t doing a damn thing for me anyway) and gives me remeron for sleep and takes me off seroquel. follow up appointment at the end of april. awesome. great. so april 26 rolls around, and the morning of my appointment, the clinic calls and tells me the dr has cancelled. exsqueeze me??? so of course my bpd is going, “awesome, so the dr hated you so much the first time she saw you, she doesn’t want to see you again!!” which of course is not the case, but come on, trying telling that to my bpd. ok, so when can we reschedule? august. end of fucking august. four goddamn months, are you fucking kidding me??? ok anyway i am getting way off track here. long story short (too late!) i’m basically on no meds right now and i am fucked. can’t concentrate, can’t focus, i’m having mini-rages multiple times a day, followed by guilt and worthlessness, dissociating like crazy, losing track of time, seeing shit, hearing shit, i stopped taking the remeron because it’s giving me vivid nightmares, trying the seroquel again but now every time i take it i’m getting restless legs for hours at night, so fuck it. not sleeping, again. obviously, my functioning is highly impaired. i’m not keeping up with my duties around the house—cooking, cleaning, etc.—-which are largely my responsibility because my dad works full time and my mother has health issues of her own which may or may not be grossly exaggerated. (a bit of info about mother dearest—textbook narcissist, but of course she’d never admit it. in her eyes, she can do no wrong, never takes the blame, it’s always someone else’s fault.)

ok so, anyway, i’m slacking on my responsibilities not because i want to, but because most of the time i don’t feel like i’m even fucking here. i let the dishes slide for 2 days and neither my mom nor my daughter (who is 17 and more than capable of doing household chores) could be arsed to wash the fucking dishes. we ran out of spoons for chrissakes. i finally get around to doing them but by the time i get to the silverware, i’m fucking exhausted (plus my kitchen is hot as hades’ ballsack, socal june and no ac??) so i ask my daughter to finish and i sit down with a cold bottle of water. immediately my mom grabs her phone and starts texting someone and i know, i just fucking know in my gut, it’s my aunt. you see, i got nosy once before and read some of her texts, and learned that my dear mother texts my aunt and blatantly lies to her. so i had a sneaky suspicion she was doing it again. i ended up forgetting about it yesterday and decided this morning to check her phone while she was in the bathroom. (bad, bad, bad, i know, but she’s fucking lying about me!) and goddammit, i was right. i was fucking right.

i don’t understand why she does this. am i that awful a person, that she constantly needs to paint me as villain and herself as victim? was i that horrible a child that she needs to turn my relatives against me??? i won’t confront her, because she’ll play the victim as per usual, but fuck!! she has me doubting my own fucking sanity.

attached are the texts, if you’ve made it this far. thanks for keeping up with my ramblings. 

tl;dr: my mother is a lying asshole.",1560225884,FALSE,BPD,2019-06-11 04:04:44,"Just had to get this off my chest i feel as if i should put a trigger warning here but i’m not sure what for...rage? profanity?? mother issues? narcissistic parent??

ok so, anyway, i’m slacking on my responsibilities not because i want to, but because most of the time i don’t feel like i’m even fucking here. i let the dishes slide for 2 days and neither my mom nor my daughter (who is 17 and more than capable of doing household chores) could be arsed to wash the fucking dishes. we ran out of spoons for chrissakes. i finally get around to doing them but by the time i get to the silverware, i’m fucking exhausted (plus my kitchen is hot as hades’ ballsack, socal june and no ac??) so i ask my daughter to finish and i sit down with a cold bottle of water. immediately my mom grabs her phone and starts texting someone and i know, i just fucking know in my gut, it’s my aunt. you see, i got nosy once before and read some of her texts, and learned that my dear mother texts my aunt and blatantly lies to her. so i had a sneaky suspicion she was doing it again. i ended up forgetting about it yesterday and decided this morning to check her phone while she was in the bathroom. (bad, bad, bad, i know, but she’s fucking lying about me!) and goddammit, i was right. i was fucking right.

i don’t understand why she does this. am i that awful a person, that she constantly needs to paint me as villain and herself as victim? was i that horrible a child that she needs to turn my relatives against me??? i won’t confront her, because she’ll play the victim as per usual, but fuck!! she has me doubting my own fucking sanity.

Anxiety stomach problems. Need to eat!,"hi guys. i’ve been dealing with intense anxiety and paranoia and panic the last week. i usually don’t struggle with anxiety, but lately it’s been through the roof. 

when i get anxiety, i can’t eat and my stomach goes crazy. from monday-wednesday i was throwing up (mainly liquids and dry heaving since i couldn’t stomach anything) and since yesterday, i’ve only had diarrhea. i haven’t been able to eat anything except a sleeve of saltines yesterday :/ obviously i’m not expelling anything because there’s nothing in my nose except water. it’s incredibly uncomfortable!

because my anxiety is making my stomach hurt badly, i can’t stomach anything without throwing up. i know my nausea is worse because i haven’t eaten anything. it’s a catch-22. i also know my mental state is getting worse because i can’t eat.

Experiences on Lamotrigine?,"i started lamotrigine two weeks ago on 25mg, but my doctor just raised it to 50mg.

my head hurts everyday, i personally feel like crying at least 3 times a day, and i can’t get any school work done, even when my professors give me extensions.

i have just been so upset lately and i don’t know how long i can deal with it. my suicidal thoughts have been running rapidly and i really don’t know how i can make them stop. i geniunely feel like my fp doesn’t give fuck about me despite everything they’ve said and i no longer feel good enough for anyone.

i haven’t attempted in over a year, but that is because i live with my parents for the time being until i can find a place of my own in the nearby city. my parents are in their 60s and have various health problems ranging from surviving cancer to simple arthritis. my mom deals with ocd, depressiom, and anxiety and i really am scared an attempt could push her over the edge into mania, as stress does that to her.

how to cope with being upset all the time ? very desperate.,"so, i sometimes think i'm ""recovering,"" only to discover that my symptoms are only lessened b/c my best friend is actively paying attention to me, calling me, reassuring me, etc. he posts about his boyfriend a lot on social media, which upsets me to an irrational degree. i've deactivated social media b/c of it before.

but basically, i cry every day, without fail. sometimes i cry up to six times a day, and the longest ive ever cried without stopping was four hours. i can sort of function when i'm crying, like performing tasks (doing dishes, showering, cleaning) just b/c i'm so used to it. it's almost always over things like: remembering past rejections, perceived rejections, agonizing over if my best friend was mad at me six months ago, what did he mean when he said xyz, why didn't he reply to my goodnight text, why do people misinterpret my motivations, obsessively ruminating over past abuse, etc. 

like, i genuinely get upset all the time to the point that my friends often joke about it (ha ha pisces infp type jokes). i have socially withdrawn b/c of this as well. i'm often terrified to express any of my insecurities or negative feelings b/c i don't want to contribute to someone leaving me. every time i begin to feel secure, something small happens and i spend an hour sobbing. i actually made myself throw up by crying so much a few nights ago. i've developed pretty bad trich as well.

the only thing that seems to help is being high. my therapist doesn't approve (for obvious reasons), but it is genuinely the only thing that has prevented me from hurting myself on several occasions. i'm currently on 300 mg of lamictal and 30 mg of prozac, which, believe it or not, has reduced my symptoms a lot. i do dbt therapy, i work through my work books, i diligently participate in art therapy, my therapist does emdr with me and...i'm still so upset all the time.

i just got finished crying in the bathroom at work (i do it so often that i have located a private bathroom to cry in) and i'm starting to get desperate. 

does anyone have any tips on how to self soothe ? or how to reassure themselves that someone still cares about them ? i wear a necklace my best friend gave me (it's a key, he says to his heart) to try to remind me that he doesn't hate me and see me as an evil worthless thing, but it doesn't always work. i objectively know he probably cares for me, but i just can't convince myself of it on an emotional level.

do these sorts of things happen to you as well ? if so, how do you handle it ? for what it's worth, i'm also diagnosed with pretty severe ptsd.

"Ways I treat my impulses. No social media, no smart phone, pre-set text messages.","hey i want to share my story about how i am in recovery.

i was abusing alot of drugs since oct 2019 and up until june 2020.

i was also with a guy that i really liked but acted crazy \*push/pull, angry outbursts, impulsive text messages, emotional hostage, emotional manipulation. i put him through the ringer and he dumped me and totally withdrew which was devastating.  i told him i had bpd and he offered to help in the beginning but i refused.

fast forward june 2020 - i am alone, single, not working, in this lockdown, no fun, doing tons of drugs and had a psychosis/mania episode at the airport on my way to ""mexico"" - i know.

my pdoc who was prescribing me the drugs in the first place put me on lamictal to stablize.

i stablized almost within like 2 weeks and decided once and for all i am taking control of my life.

i deleted social media perm, got rid of my iphone, got a smart phone, and developed a set of pre set text messages (ok, yes, no, can't text call me, let's chat on the phone). alot of my issues stem from just really bad communication skills.

if only i could somehow control my communication and use dbt like dear man when i got upset.

anyway it's been over a month of good stability. my ex even reached out and i think we might meet up.

i am on lamictal and geodon. i have more control thank god. i think removing alot of technology has helped me and of course the meds. i am in therapy 3x a week as well learning dbt (my insurance allows this, amazing right?).

How do you guys feel about having roommates?,"for those of you who are unmarried/single, do you live on your own or with roommates? 

i was diagnosed roughly two months ago with bpd.

prior to, during, and following the diagnosis, my life was chaotic, even for ""normal"" people standards--i abruptly changed jobs (not for borderline reasons), my ex's mom tried to kill herself, i was diagnosed, my ex threw me out, i had to move back in with my parents. 

i'm 26, so this is less than ideal. to make the situation worse, my father has bpd and never sought help for it. he refuses to speak to me because he didn't approve of the fact that i was living with my ex before marriage. i'm okay with not talking to my dad--but it's this kind of crap (along with a myriad of other behavioral problems) that made me the person i am today, truthfully. my mother is supportive, but at the end of the day they live nearly 30 minutes away from my work.

i'm currently in the process of receiving treatment. i'm starting lamotrigine this evening (hopefully no weird skin rashes) and having my first dbt session on friday. my game plan was to ride out the first month of lamotrigine and make sure i'm doing okay, then find somewhere to live for the month of april.

I've been denying this dx for a long time and I don't know what to do. Why is it easier to have bipolar?,"i hope this post will make some sense. i tend to ramble. i also have decreased cognitive functioning from all these dumb meds, especially lamictal and gabapentin. i swear i'm smarter than i'm gonna sound. for reference my official dx are c-ptsd (very well managed now though), generalized anxiety disorder, and add. and then of course bipolar disorder type ii and bpd. it can get a bit dizzy with all of these! but i've gotten pretty good at isolating which symptom is from which disorder.

how do i start? mental illness runs in my family. i was dx with juvenile bipolar disorder when i was 13-14. at first, i was really upset by it. my grandpa had bipolar and committed suicide when i was 5. i felt like now i was this 'crazy person.' but i pretty quickly accepted it. i read everything i could on the subject. i've always been very involved in my own care even from a young age, rather than doing whatever they suggested. i think that's served me well.

after a suicide attempt, last year, in the hospital i had two doctors come into my room. this wasn't the psych hospital, i was still in the regular hospital being treated. i think they were pdocs though. one sat on either side of me. it felt very much like an interrogation. i hated the way they looked at me. they clearly looked down on me, for whatever reason.

i felt they were really condescending. they asked if i'd ever heard of bpd. i said that i knew a little bit. they talked about dbt and things like that. it's a bit fuzzy.

since then, i have really ignored the bpd diagnosis and i can't quite explain *why.* i'm okay with being bipolar. i see it very much as a physical illness, something in my brain. so maybe i see bpd as an emotional disorder, something that's just in my personality, hence my *fault* and my weakness in not dealing with it. additionally, the fact that childhood abuse is so common with those with bpd makes me feel uncomfortable and...dirty? like i said, i can't explain it very well. i guess i despise the idea that my abusers could still have so much control over me.

can anyone understand what i'm going through? my therapist really believes i need to address the bpd along with the bipolar. because having both can be confusing and i need to be more aware of which symptom goes with which, like i said. does anyone understand the feeling of accepting one mental illness but not another?

Really doubting if I should keep up with therapy,"if it helps you even a bit, better don't read this, i was just splitting intensely before.

therapy is made out to be this thing which makes you sane. ""dude you need therapy."" then i get to sit there once a week for a lot of money (paid by insurance but still a lot) and i'm told things which i already know since long ago. especially when it comes to depression. i don't like calling it depression because often it's not an actual episode, and i think bipolar (2 or nos) would better capture what i go through. nobody ever gave me a diagnosis yet and i don't have a bpd diagnosis either probably because i'm avoidant/schizoid too (previously been suggested aspergers but that wasn't a diagnosis either). but i get this feeling they don't even really understand what i go throught after a dozen of sessions. therapy basically says ""just do it but don't do the bad things"" and i know the tricks already, but i can't get myself to actually do it or it was useless in the past. i tell them this, and they keep insisting on it. at some point i stop arguing ok that's what they have to say. (for example about getting up in the morning. the problem is when i'm depressed i actually want to die and sleep forever, but the solution is to go out of bed and try to do something. i already know this but when i'm shitty i'm like a different person and won't give a single fuck about my goals or ideals. there's a reason i'm seeking help.)

if they already can't handle these things in a way which doesn't end up making me feel worse, i don't want to go into my extreme self hatred and harming behavior/ideation. and i fear being hospitalized.

prior to this therapist i saw one who was more analytically oriented. i felt like it really was mainly me talking and the only thing it achieved was that she got sad when i kept talking about my depression but she only rarely invalidated me by accident. so i went to a place where they do cbt and dbt-oriented therapy. i remember the pdoc at my previous therapist's place told me i should probably go for inpatient therapy because it seems i'm resistant to ambulant therapy and meds made me react badly, but then he was like maybe try therapy again when i suggested it.

i already had enough therapy sessions, that starting a new therapy has to be granted by the insurance. i guess that would not be the problem if a pdoc writes a report, but i would have to go to a gp again and most importantly start from zero again with therapy. just did that a few months ago. but i don't really see anymore how therapy could help me at all, i feel like my issues are actually too complex and don't fit so well into diagnostic boxes for it to work. also i was asking about changing meds, currently taking standardized st john's wort and by now i have the usual extreme mood and energy fluctuations i've always used to have but more intensely, but some time ago consensus was to keep on taking it. i think i will just go off it. i guess the alternatives would be lamictal or lithium but now is a terrible time to start a new drug and also i kind of don't want to.

there's so much going on in my life and i feel like quitting therapy and meds for good is a bad idea, because i'm still bad and i really don't know how i will ever get better, but i don't see how it's helping either. my mood was almost manic before therapy today and now i feel bad and can't stop crying.

Good Week :),"i started lamictal (25 mg 2x/day) in addition to my wellbutrin xr (450 mg in the morning) two weeks ago. at first, i didn't notice any good changes and was actually more anxious and depressed the first week. then, last week, i had an actually really emotionally stable week. i can't remember the last time i felt that i was really in control of my emotions like that. no long crying episodes, no sudden anger i let get out of hand, and more cognitive awareness during slight emotional unbalances instead of severe dissociating. i know that my therapy is what's ultimately helping me make it through, but i'm really happy that i seemed to have found a medication that helps me keep my emotion swings under control. 

i could cry - if i can keep this up, i actually have hope that i'll be in remission maybe within the next five years or so. and i've never thought i would ever go into remission. never ever ever thought i could until this past week.

How to deal with these emotions?,"first some background. i've had bpd who knows since when. i got the diagnosis around 7 or 8 years ago. no one ever explained it to me. i re-read my papers last spring and found the diagnosis, so i kind of have known only for a year. i'm angry, since i could've done so much work so much earlier, at the stage when i still wasn't in so deep. years of pointless therapy, psychiatric meetings, meds, they were all ineffective, as i had no idea what was wrong. i thought i was bi-polar, but no one just believed. or that i was just a bad person. i went to a kind of a dbt group last fall, for 10 weeks. i hated it. i didn't fit in. but i got a lot of info about schemas and ego states. i've also been reading stuff online, so i know about this stuff quite a lot at this point.

so, now instead of ""emotion x strikes and makes a mess"" i get this: x happens, emotion comes, overwhelms me, i recognize and name it, i react if in company, i hate myself/my bpd for the emotions effect as i can see it's inappropriate and exaggerated, i feel ashamed for not being able to control the emotion, i try to talk about it, i feel empty and exhausted. this takes around 1 to 10 hours to go through. so, what now? 

for example today: i was in a really good mood, out in town with my bf. we had lunch, joked, had fun. i wanted to go donate blood, as i've tried four times and succeeded only ones during the last 8 years. we went in. i went to talk about my health, as is done by procedure. first i blab my stuff about my previous meds before the nurse had started to look through the paper. then we go through the normal stuff and talk about my meds again. painfully long check up on lamictal and effexor i quit before this year. clear, whew. then to my new med, valdoxan. i've used it for 4 weeks, papers say you need to use it for a month before donating. in the end: clear, as the dates match because feb had only 28 days... then on to other stuff, i check clear. yay, i can donate, finally! then i go lay on the chair, my bf was almost done with his donation at this point and he went in to see the nurse after me. feelings of humiliation and feeling embarrassement start to rise, as people had to wait because of me and there were so many questions about my meds. then i realize my car might get a ticket, and i had to run to put more money in the meter. more embarrassed, trying to calm myself on the chair, finally ready to donate. and then the nurse comes and asks me back to the questioning booth. and then she tells me that i can't donate. ""you've had these extreme meds to control you, so now you need to wait 6 months to see that you're ok. we just want to look after you, we don't want to cause you any distress."" w-t-f!? i was already extremely embarrassed, and then that. i had to get my back from the chair, wait until my bf was ready to leave (you need to take your time after donating, after all), know that people saw what happened, me running around because of the car, taking a ton of time in the booth, getting rejected in the end. i almost started to cry. on the way to the car i told my bf about these feelings, in a few short sentences, and almost wanted to scream. in the car he stated that ""no one laughed at you, that didn't happen"" or something (i said i felt like a laughing-stock) and i screamed him to shut up. that was my only real reaction. then i just remained silent. i understand their point and why they rejected me. but understanding didn't help dull the feelings one bit. 

so, at what point should i have used mindfulness? how? i know my feelings were exaggerated, i knew it even before i went to the car to put more money, but i had no way of dulling them down. what can i do in a situation like that? what should i have felt instead?

Extreme mood swings and Lamotrigine,"hopefully this hasn't been posted recently; i used the search engine and there weren't many results.

i was diagnosed with bpd about a year ago at age 23, after i stayed at a hospital due to drug overdose. till recently i haven't really thought about the diagnosis a lot; i did dbt and met many others which seemed perfectly neurotypical, we had good and bad times together during these 12 weeks.

i knew what bpd meant but didn't thought bad of it, just a part of me, but i noticed that - maybe - these mood swings aren't normal. hell, they are absolutely not! i thought it was ""normal"" to just have mood swings througout the day but switching every 2-3 minutes from laughing to crying?

it's either a deeply sadened state where i can't speak, if feels like someone is choking my throat and everytime i try to talk i start crying; everything hurts, especially joints, i can barely think straight, i can't concentrate and just everything is dreadful, it just hurts to exist and during these moments i usually overdose on opioids or do toxic stuff, drink alc with benzos or something else, you get the deal.

or

extremely happy, laughing, dancing, sometimes singing even with others arround, ""i can do anything!"", ""the world is a wonderful place"" etc (i'm sure you know what i'm talking about). it's such an euphoric feeling and i love it! i love doing opioids and while i'm euphoric it feels like low-dose serotonin/dopamin-rush.


we tried lamictal and i take it since december 2016. i currently have a dose of 300 mg a day and i don't feel much different. i have more 'grey area' moods with not a lot of emotion but thats it. is that how it's supposed to feel? is the dose too low? are there similar drugs that i can use as a reference?

it's either a deeply sadened state where i can't speak, if feels like someone is choking my throat and everytime i try to talk i start crying; everything hurts, especially joints, i can barely think straight, i can't concentrate and just everything is dreadful, it just hurts to exist and during these moments i usually overdose on opioids or do toxic stuff, drink alc with benzos or something else, you get the deal.

or

extremely happy, laughing, dancing, sometimes singing even with others arround, ""i can do anything!"", ""the world is a wonderful place"" etc (i'm sure you know what i'm talking about). it's such an euphoric feeling and i love it! i love doing opioids and while i'm euphoric it feels like low-dose serotonin/dopamin-rush.


we tried lamictal and i take it since december 2016. i currently have a dose of 300 mg a day and i don't feel much different. i have more 'grey area' moods with not a lot of emotion but thats it. is that how it's supposed to feel? is the dose too low? are there similar drugs that i can use as a reference?

i'm not really sure what i should expect? i haven't felt rage in a while which is good, but thats it so far.",extreme mood swing lamotrigine hopefully hasnt posted recently used search engine werent many result diagnosed bpd year ago age 23 stayed hospital due drug overdose till recently havent really thought diagnosis lot dbt met many others seemed perfectly neurotypical good bad time together 12 week knew bpd meant didnt thought bad part noticed maybe mood swing arent normal hell absolutely thought normal mood swing througout day switching every 23 minute laughing cry either deeply sadened state cant speak feel like someone choking throat everytime try talk start cry everything hurt especially joint barely think straight cant concentrate everything dreadful hurt exist moment usually overdose opioids toxic stuff drink alc benzos something else get deal extremely happy laughing dancing sometimes singing even others arround anything world wonderful place etc im sure know im talking euphoric feeling love love opioids im euphoric feel like lowdose serotonindopaminrush tried lamictal take since december 2016 currently dose 300 mg day dont feel much different grey area mood lot emotion thats supposed feel dose low similar drug use reference im really sure expect havent felt rage good thats far,0.5849730704303830,['Lamotrigine'],"```json

Day 1 on lamictal,"ok i know there have been posts like this before but...my bpd makes me anxious and i want reassurance directed at me. 

i was diagnosed with bpd four years ago at 18. we knew i had it long before that, but obviously i couldn’t be diagnosed. i have been on quillivant for my adhd the whole time, but i’ve never done any medication for the bpd. i am now doing emdr and taking a semester off to try and work on my mental health, so i decided to try medication. 

i did a ton of research and decided lamictal was right for me- it’s the only thing approved by the fda for bpd, and it’s supposedly weight neutral, which is good for my ed. 

i started it last night (50 mg, as i’m on hormonal birth control and have been for a decade. that’s not changing.) i had a nightmare last night and woke up drenched in sweat. my neck/back are very sore today and my heart rate has been crazy high, even though i’m exhausted. i’m also starving hungry, which is weird because usually the quillivant suppresses my appetite. 

my bf did notice that when he lost at monopoly and was upset, i only asked if he was mad at me once. when he said no, i accepted his answer and moved on. that is pretty abnormal for me- normally i will ask “are you sure” etc etc. i also noticed that i was depressed because i was hungry and immediately got up and ate.  that is also abnormal for me. 

i just wanted to know- is all of this normal? will it go away as i adjust to the med? anyone else have these same side effects?

Day #2 of Staying Home,"i have been managing my bpd symptoms pretty well lately. using mindfulness to help my anxiety works well but i can’t seem to figure out how to help my brain not be depressed. i’m on lexapro and lamictal. today is my 69th (nice) day of not drinking, which was my coping mechanism of choice for 15 years.

i called off work yesterday due to severe back pain (unrelated, must have tweaked it somehow) and i woke up and mentally couldn’t make myself get out of bed. today, my back still hurt and i woke up wanting to cry but i pulled myself together, took a shower, put on work clothes, emailed my therapist, drank coffee... and called off work again after i burst into tears for no reason.

yesterday, neither of my bosses replied to my texts about not coming in to work. my assistant did, though, so i know my texts were going through. two days in a row i’ve offered to do whatever i can from home to no response. i texted a third boss today to tell her that i didn’t get a response from the other two and to let me know that she got my message. no response yet. she’s on vacation which is why i didn’t text her before but now i’m getting really nervous.

they always tell me what a great job i do. they have worked with me to make a schedule work where i could take a day off during the week to go to doctor appointments when i had a lot to go to. they worked with me when i was in outpatient therapy after my last series of panic attacks (obv i didn’t tell them why i had to leave early every day to go to the hospital after work for a month). i’m afraid i’ve finally ruined everything. i really like my job. i’m just not dealing with things very well right now.

i asked my doctor for an excuse from work so at least i’ll have something to give them. haven’t heard back from them yet either.

Emptiness getting worse,"hey all.
lately i've been finding that the emptiness that comes part and parcel with this diagnosis has been getting so much worse.
i push myself to get up and do things that i know i enjoy, or used to enjoy. when i'm doing them though, i become easily bored and frustrated. 
alcohol, sex, self-harm, binge eating and obsessive exercise have not filled it. 
i can't pinpoint a trigger for it becoming worse; however, i am currently in a relationship in which i feel like a fraud, like i'm never good enough and a bit like an imposter - maybe it is contributing to the emptiness.
i'm currently on lamotrigine 200mg and mirtazapine 45mg. i go to a psychologist and am trying to work through dbt on my own, but have seen little to no improvement. i have only recently been put on the lamotrigine and have already noticed i dissociate a lot more on this medication. 
i don't often let on how much i am struggling, and i can usually cover it up, but lately i've been so fucking empty that i don't know how much longer i can do this.
did/does anyone have an experience with this, and if so, how do you lessen it?

Need a place to vent,"i was diagnosed as bipolar a few years ago. i thought it was fitting then, because i did have severe mood swings, sleep issues, and so forth. but i feel as if i may not be bipolar, but instead borderline. please don’t jump down my throat, as i’m not trying to “self-diagnose”, it just seems different. i’m a 17 year old male, and they can’t make any personality diagnoses until i’m 18-20. i’ve never brought this up to any doctor, so i’m just reaching out to let people hear what i have to say.

i’ve been through a lot of stuff in life that’s left hard imprints. not so much severe, one time events, but instead unknowingly damaging events that happened for months/years. 

i’ve always had mood swings. but the more i grew, the more i realized they weren’t typical “bipolar” mood swings. i understand there’s rapid-cycling, but that still didn’t fit it. 

i can go from neutral in a good way to violently upset or anxious with a simple sentence from someone that wasn’t derogatory/hurtful at all. it’s almost as if i split down the middle mood wise. i examine what people say to me so heavy that even the slightest things that aren’t meant to upset me will throw me into suicidal ideation or an internal rage nobody sees. it can last for a day, or for 5 minutes, then i return to normal. i’m always nervous, and i’m terrified of being left alone. i have a wonderful boyfriend that helps me so much, and the only thing i can think of is when he’ll leave me behind, how he will leave me, and so on. i never let him know this because i’ll seem looney. i’m never level headed for more than a few days. the slightest thing can send me into a fit of rage that i let nobody see, a panic attack, dissociation, or just a fit of sobbing. the drop of a pin could trigger it. i use the word “dissociation” sparingly, as i don’t experience it unless i swing (i feel nothing but an empty rage, i don’t talk, i don’t remember doing much, etc)

i’m miserable. this has only gotten worse. i know i’m only 17, so please don’t tell me that it’s just hormones. it was never this severe until the events that happened years ago. it’s only getting worse. i’m on a mood stabilizer (lamictal) but it doesn’t do much. i feel like therapy isn’t accomplishing what i wish it would (cbt). any input is accepted. i’m just looking for advice/support/a direction to turn.",1584509827,FALSE,BPD,2020-03-18 05:37:07,"Need a place to vent i was diagnosed as bipolar a few years ago. i thought it was fitting then, because i did have severe mood swings, sleep issues, and so forth. but i feel as if i may not be bipolar, but instead borderline. please don’t jump down my throat, as i’m not trying to “self-diagnose”, it just seems different. i’m a 17 year old male, and they can’t make any personality diagnoses until i’m 18-20. i’ve never brought this up to any doctor, so i’m just reaching out to let people hear what i have to say.

i can go from neutral in a good way to violently upset or anxious with a simple sentence from someone that wasn’t derogatory/hurtful at all. it’s almost as if i split down the middle mood wise. i examine what people say to me so heavy that even the slightest things that aren’t meant to upset me will throw me into suicidal ideation or an internal rage nobody sees. it can last for a day, or for 5 minutes, then i return to normal. i’m always nervous, and i’m terrified of being left alone. i have a wonderful boyfriend that helps me so much, and the only thing i can think of is when he’ll leave me behind, how he will leave me, and so on. i never let him know this because i’ll seem looney. i’m never level headed for more than a few days. the slightest thing can send me into a fit of rage that i let nobody see, a panic attack, dissociation, or just a fit of sobbing. the drop of a pin could trigger it. i use the word “dissociation” sparingly, as i don’t experience it unless i swing (i feel nothing but an empty rage, i don’t talk, i don’t remember doing much, etc)

i’m miserable. this has only gotten worse. i know i’m only 17, so please don’t tell me that it’s just hormones. it was never this severe until the events that happened years ago. it’s only getting worse. i’m on a mood stabilizer (lamictal) but it doesn’t do much. i feel like therapy isn’t accomplishing what i wish it would (cbt). any input is accepted. i’m just looking for advice/support/a direction to turn.",need place vent diagnosed bipolar year ago thought fitting severe mood swing sleep issue forth feel may bipolar instead borderline please don’t jump throat i’m trying “selfdiagnose” seems different i’m 17 year old male can’t make personality diagnosis i’m 1820 i’ve never brought doctor i’m reaching let people hear say i’ve lot stuff life that’s left hard imprint much severe one time event instead unknowingly damaging event happened monthsyears i’ve always mood swing grew realized weren’t typical “bipolar” mood swing understand there’s rapidcycling still didn’t fit go neutral good way violently upset anxious simple sentence someone wasn’t derogatoryhurtful it’s almost split middle mood wise examine people say heavy even slightest thing aren’t meant upset throw suicidal ideation internal rage nobody see last day 5 minute return normal i’m always nervous i’m terrified left alone wonderful boyfriend help much thing think he’ll leave behind leave never let know i’ll seem looney i’m never level headed day slightest thing send fit rage let nobody see panic attack dissociation fit sobbing drop pin could trigger use word “dissociation” sparingly don’t experience unless swing feel nothing empty rage don’t talk don’t remember much etc i’m miserable gotten worse know i’m 17 please don’t tell it’s hormone never severe event happened year ago it’s getting worse i’m mood stabilizer lamictal doesn’t much feel like therapy isn’t accomplishing wish would cbt input accepted i’m looking advicesupporta direction turn,0.5574592719005440,['Lamotrigine'],"```json

I (23 FpwBPD) broke up with my boyfriend (22M) 3 weeks ago,"we were together for 3 years... lived together on an off. we were very turbulent, both of us, we fought a lot, and we were very intense... i'm bpd, he has major depression with suicide tendencies. 

i just started dbt therapy (i did it 2 years ago but couldn't complete it for economic problems)
i'm on fluoxetine and lamotrigine (for like 2 months)

this 3 weeks have been so crazy... i did sexting with a guy online, right after breaking up, because i knew he wouldn't want me back, or fight me back... if i do that... it kinda worked... 

the day i broke up with him he threatened suicide, i sent the messages to his parents (he lives with them) and block him everywhere... like an hour later he talked to me on every social media, the stalking began...

2 days later he had an overdose, survived, and then kinda blamed me for it, or for not being there for him, like i left him in his worst moment or so.

the stalking on social media continued for maybe 10 days, after it stopped, i stopped doing impulsive stuff... talking to guys online specifically... and then more symptoms started on me... mostly dissociation, derealization, and the one i'm worried about now is emotional detachment.

I do NOT believe in recovery,"hi. first time here, first time posting. i've had bpd diagnosis for around 7 or 8 years. i only found out about it last spring. i've seen a psychiatrist (from 9 years ago to 2 years ago), two different kinds of therapists (other one was horrible, can't remember the type now, 7 years ago for about 1,5years), and cognitive psychotherapy (two years, with one year in between, ended in dec 2013), currently seeing a nurse once a month (who really doesn't understand me at all. i dislike her but am too tired with all this bs to ask for another), took a bpd course last fall(group therapy, 10 times to inform us about schemas and  states of mind), and recently quit venlafaxine (had used for years, noticed now that it caused me to have bed as it made me gain 12kg in 6 months when the dosage was upped) and lamictal (i noticed by accident that it gives me severe head aches even after the starting period). so i've done the works, tried to get better. and i haven't, i've only gotten severely worse.

i've lost all my friends. either by actually telling them to f*ck off (last time was 4 years ago, i think. after that i haven't had a real friend as i stopped trying to be friends with anyone as i had done that a couple times before), or by alienating myself from everyone bit by bit. people i thought were my true friends have gotten married without telling me, separated and started new relationships, new jobs, etc. they moved away, i stayed to rot... i hate my bf (been together for 6 years, have a 3 year-old son. won't marry me since i'm a psycho and obese), way too often, though mostly we're ok. today i broke up with him as i found out yet another one of my former friends had gotten married and it makes me hate myself. i'm not good enough to even be engaged. i have another bf, since i'm in a polyamorous relationship, and he made us talk, told us it's not over.

i can't keep this coherent, i'm sorry. i hate my life. i don't have a job, i've never done anything worth anything. yeah, i graduated from a uni, but it doesn't give me a job. i helped start a huge theater group as a student thing in the uni. yeah, everyone else had fun, i just did all the work. those worth nothing. zilch. i'm worth nothing. 

i have no faith in ever getting better. i've tried to get help and it has done me nothing, even got me worse. i hate people who tell me that bpd can be cured. either that is total bs or i'm just so totally damaged that it will never, ever be true on my case. i guess the latter is right as i've seen people get better from all sorts of stuff.  i've driven myself out from three bpd forums as the people there started to disgust me with their ""you can get better"", ""just decide to start getting better"", ""you can do it"", ""only you can do it for yourself"" -bs. there is nothing that can cure me.

i just want to kill myself. started cutting today, and hate myself as i'm such a pathetic wimp that i can only make scrapes when i want to cut properly. i can't kill myself because of my child. but my life is a hell. a fat, disgusting, worthless hell.

I’m fucking everything up,"since i came home one month ago (spent three months homeless because i didn’t want to live with my parents anymore), i’ve just been so irritated with everyone. 

i told my mom why i didn’t want to go back to the same iop program i was at before— it was because a nurse (who was my treatment coordinator and also led some groups) told me very calmly and seriously that i was buying into my diagnosis and feigning my symptoms. my mom’s response — “so you’re going to sacrifice your treatment because of one thing one person said?” i pretty much lost it at that point. she went on to talk about other times where people would say things like that to other people, but it just got me more upset. 

it began to escalate from there, and then i just wanted to go to my room to be alone. she didn’t let me go. she wanted me to sit down. i said no. it escalated to the point where she started screaming “i’m your mother. sit down or i will sit your ass down. sit the fuck down or i will call the police so they can watch me sit you down in your chair.” 

i kept saying no and of course i started crying. after a few minutes my mom tried to make me feel better by hugging me and everything but i didn’t want anything to do with it. it got to a point where i just sat down at the fucking table to make her happy. 

later today my dad wanted me to go with my younger sister to try out karate, but i said i didn’t go. he kept insisting “why?” and said i was just going to do nothing here. i told him i needed to finish some onboarding forms for my new job and i needed to have it ready for tomorrow, and then he said “but then you’re being boring.”

i told my mom why i didn’t want to go back to the same iop program i was at before— it was because a nurse (who was my treatment coordinator and also led some groups) told me very calmly and seriously that i was buying into my diagnosis and feigning my symptoms. my mom’s response — “so you’re going to sacrifice your treatment because of one thing one person said?” i pretty much lost it at that point. she went on to talk about other times where people would say things like that to other people, but it just got me more upset. 

it began to escalate from there, and then i just wanted to go to my room to be alone. she didn’t let me go. she wanted me to sit down. i said no. it escalated to the point where she started screaming “i’m your mother. sit down or i will sit your ass down. sit the fuck down or i will call the police so they can watch me sit you down in your chair.” 

i kept saying no and of course i started crying. after a few minutes my mom tried to make me feel better by hugging me and everything but i didn’t want anything to do with it. it got to a point where i just sat down at the fucking table to make her happy. 

later today my dad wanted me to go with my younger sister to try out karate, but i said i didn’t go. he kept insisting “why?” and said i was just going to do nothing here. i told him i needed to finish some onboarding forms for my new job and i needed to have it ready for tomorrow, and then he said “but then you’re being boring.”

"Ritalin (methylphenidate) is the only medication that gets me close to feeling ""normal""","hi, i suffer from bpd with comorbid atypical depression and i want to share my success story with a medication that is not typically prescribed to bpd patiens, on the contrary, for many doctors the bpd label is enough not to give you this medicine.

two notes first

1) i don't suffer from anxiety
2) i'm not prone to substance addiction
3) i also suffer from adhd-i

i've tried various ssri/atypical antidepressants, lamictal, a serotonine modulator and all these meds made me feel worse, emotionally numb, anhedonic, apathetic, still suicidal / self-harming.

it wasn't untill my adhd friend gave me his ritalin since with our layman logic, for depressive states it only makes sense to employ a stimulant.

and it did work. it got me out of bed, it gave me energy and most importantly it altered my negstive mental state so that even after the effect of the med went off, i still remained in the ""good mental state.""

4 months and counting and this med became my magic pill. i'm perscribed 20mg a day but usually i'm good with just one in the morning, saving the other for a sudden mood switch that would have needed a medication.

ritalin works for all sorts of negative emotions.

you're feeling low/hopeless/idealizing suicide? ritalin uplifts my mood and i feel ok.

you're feeling aggressive/angry/irritated? ritalin calms me down and i gives me back an ability to oversight my conduct/ not to do anything impulsive.

you're feeling emotional/crying spells/hurt? ritalin gives me confidence and allows me to see the situation not to be all that awry as i feel it in the moment.

now, there's a slim shot this med will be your magic pill as well but if you have tried all the usual medication and are not prone to addictive behaviour plus don't suffer from too much anxiety, i frankly believe ritalin may help you out, that's why i'm sharing my insight.

Gaining weight,"has anyone else noticed weight gain on lamotrigine (lamatical)?

 i feel like i've put on weight since changing to this medication and while i have weighed myself and technically i haven't gained weight i feel and look bigger, almost swollen. i'm not sure if this is just body dysmorhpia fucking with my head since the numbers on the scales hasn't changed but physically i feel like it is so obvious. i've mentioned it to my partner and my mother and while they haven't straight up agreed with me they haven't shut it down like they usually would. idk if they're just sick of having to reassure me constantly or if they're just playing along or if i actually have gotten bigger. 

everything i see online suggests that lamotrigine theoretically shouldn't induce weight gain, in fact this is one of the reasons i opted for this medication in place of something else because i have horrible body image issues.

Medication causing severe short-term memory loss.,"i've been taking a pretty hefty amount of lamictal for a few years and it took me quite a long time to notice but it occurred to me recently that my short-term memory is in the trash. if i misplace anything, it's gone – it's impossible for me to retrace my steps or think of the last time i'd seen it. i forget things all the time, whether it's assignments or leaving my travel mug on the counter when i go to school or work.

i would say that it's starting to impede my life but it really always has since it's begun, but i'm entirely reliant on the medication to function. if i don't take it, i have (kinesthetic hallucinations?) (nerve issues?), basically i begin withdrawing the immediate next day and i start to feel a numbness in my body that feels like vibrating, and it feels like my feet don't touch the floor, like i'm levitating. it's very similar to getting a really intense weed high and i get really irritable and frustrate easily. i can't focus and my mood swings go out of control.

I have no idea how to handle this overflow of emotions right now.,"recently my boyfriend (23m) and i (21f) decided that we need to take a break since my bpd behaviors have begun to do more bad than good for us. it stresses me out because i keep wanting to reach out to him in hopes i get a response, but we both know and acknowledge a break is probably what will help best as i start medication and therapy again. he works at an in-patient hospital, and suggested the idea of a break so he would not interfere with treatment since he sees the same people come back all the time on account of not understanding boundaries.

months of clarity and progress.. then the darkness came back. feeling lost and defeated.,"i've avoided talking about this today and typing up an excessively long post about it all, but i don't think i'll be able to stop thinking about it constantly until i talk about it. hope someone will read until the end and offer some reassurance or send good vibes that are very much needed today. &lt;3   


i've been on meds for the past few months,  i got super lucky as i started to notice lamictal working pretty early on, it was awesome - because i've spent years trying to find something to give my brain a break. so, the last few months i've been pretty stable. the first month was the best, it was so refreshing and my life wasn't the worst either. the actual components of my life right now are pretty shitty, but it's not destroying me as it normally would early this year. i went like the entire month of july without crying, which was huuuge for me lol. even after i ended up breaking the streak it was a rare thing. i wasn't yelling at my boyfriend all the time or accusing him of things i just made up in my head. i was so much more in control of my emotions, not experiencing the extremes anymore, and i was capable of assuring myself that any intrusive thought were just in my head. it was new for me, it was exciting, i had so much hope.   


the past couple of weeks have been kinda tough. nothing too extreme, but the stress was getting overwhelming. no matter how stable or possibly even ""numb"" i was to what was actually happening in my life, i still felt like i was living in hell. i just wasn't exactly sad about it if that makes sense, i was even hopeful that i would adjust to it to where it wasn't as shitty. (mostly referring to my dogshit new job)   
i still felt good about things.  


last night, my boyfriend and i had a rough convo about something that triggered the fuck out of me. i spent all night crying and feeling absolutely worthless. then....today hits. god, today has been so fucking shitty. i clocked into work at 12 and then had to clock back out at 1 because i just couldn't do anything. i take adderall too, so usually i have no issue getting my shit done but notttt today. for the last 6 hours i have been remembering and reliving everything that has happened to me in the last 11 years of misery that has led me up to be as damaged as i am now. l i have been crying all day, completely incapable of focusing or thinking about anything else. literally just sitting in front of my computer alternating between disassociating and being on reddit; waiting to finally be able to stop thinking about this so i could do my fucking work. building up more and more stress thinking about my unanswered emails.   


idk, i just feel like i'm back to the beginning. it's almost as if what i am feeling seems new to me because it has been so long since i experienced such an extreme low. i'm feeling the weight of everything i've been able to push away for the last few months, and it's pretty heavy. i feel so defeated. it know it seems so dramatic idk i just feel like all the hope i had just disappeared within a single fucking day. knowing that no matter how much a medication is working, there's always the possibility of getting triggered by something small and then spiraling again and having to put yourself back together again. god it just sucks so much. i don't know how to find the words to explain how lost and defeated i feel right now. it's a mix of anger and sadness and frustration and defeat and the overwhelming urge of shutting everyone out of my life, it's actually making me sick to my stomach.

Finally coming to terms with my diagnosis,"i'm 23 and i've seen 8 therapists and 3 psychiatrists within the past 9 years. therapy has been a temporary relief, and i'm not currently seeing a therapist though i know i should. i'm really glad i found this sub because i thought for a long time that i was the only one feeling this way, so it's nice to see that i'm not the only one battling the crazy feelings and tendencies i have. 

therapy never lasts long for me because i lie. i lie a lot. i get ashamed of my issues so i pretend like they don't exist and just talk about my past mostly. i don't bring up any current issues. just the same shit about being insecure and shy and victimizing myself (lies) and then after a month or two they send me off because they think i'm okay. 

it's taken the past year and a half to finally slow my thoughts down enough to become aware of my actions. my boyfriend helped me a lot with this, and i love him more than anything. he has put up with so much of my crazy, victimizing, manipulative bs and has helped me learn to be a better person along the way. i don't know how he does it. he's a true angel. 

i feel so much unlike other people. to the point of discomfort. i have no friends save my boyfriend, my parents, my sister, and a best friend who lives far away. i talk to myself in the car to console myself and get my thoughts straight. i also have maladaptive daydreaming that is pretty much a total impairment. ive been doing it for so long. when i was young i started by imagining two girls living in my head, controlling my thoughts and actions. one was goofy, lazy, sarcastic. the other motivated, smart as hell, and a hard ass. one of my therapists was truly fascinated by this and thinks that they represent the dual way i see myself. i hate it because it's started such a burden that has gotten worse over time. even when i'm talking with someone my mind just runs off with another thought, i don't get what they're saying, and then i hate myself for being a shitty listener. 

i imagine everything. i imagine myself being perfect, being not me because i hate me. it's an impossible standard and it makes me depressed. 

i wonder if i have adhd. at work and at home i put off things forever. i've been an avid writer all my life but i put it off now because i can't sit still. same when i was in college doing homework. once i took ritalin to study for a test and it was out of this world. i had never been so happy and motivated. but i don't think my doctor would ever give me that.

i was taking lamictal when i saw my old psychiatrist. she refused to diagnose me. my diagnoses have oscillated from depression to bipolar to borderline. she hinted it was more borderline but she didn't want to say for sure since she said it can be hard to distinguish from bipolar and i guess i didn't see her long enough for her to track what my issues were. but i don't get the bipolar mood cycles. it's beyond crazy moods. my moods fluctuate daily, my self image is disgusting, i hate myself, i playfully fantasize about suicide (i would never do it), i fear my boyfriend will leave and i cannot handle fights at all, i get super happy then super sad within a two hour time span, i manipulate people, i argue senselessly, and i wander out of my body so much it's insane. i feel like i'm wrapped in string and i just float away from myself. i say things without even realizing what i'm saying until i get called out. and then i have to blubber around saying i never meant it, just because i have no self control. 

i've smoked weeks for 3 years and now i take lamictal again (it's been really great and i've really never had such stable moods, though i still have plenty of issues to continue working on, but it slows me down enough that dealing with problems seems manageable) and i take klonopins for anxiety. i've had debilitating anxiety since i was a kid and i never realized my intense physical fear had anything to do with that until i read more on it and received treatment. i'm very careful about taking it because i know it's addictive. i take a tiny dose. i used to abuse stuff like that but i'm really proud of myself because i generally have no self control, but i've been great about keeping this under control. 

but still, i hate myself. not really who i am now... i have no identity. i've relied on other people telling me who i am to create an identity. but it's never me, it's never enough, and it never makes me happy. i hate who i used to be because i think everything i've done is embarrassing and horrible. but people say i'm a really nice person and think i'm really smart. i'm working full time and acing a grad level class i take in the evenings but it's still not enough. when i get good grades or positive feedback i just think, they know i'm crazy and they're helping me get good grades so i won't hurt myself. 

this is me every day. i try to make schedules, change habits. but really i don't care. i've felt so shitty for so long it's second nature. i want to change, just not enough to follow through. i have no idea how to stop and just discipline myself. 

this is a mess of a post but i've been wanting to post here for a while. to get stuff off my chest, maybe hear from someone who feels this way too. i consider myself high functioning when i'm out in the world, but alone i am a train wreck. i want to lost everyone i know and run away and live and die alone. i'm a burden and should not be exposed to a damn person because i'm rude and shitty and a tornado of shitty thoughts and moods.

Lamictal experiences/side effects?,"i've been on lamictal for a little bit now, and it's the only med i'm on currently. started slow, was at 150 for a little while, and upped to 200mg a few days ago.

i've had pretty bad side effects with other meds in the past, so maybe i'm just really susceptible/sensitive to them.
