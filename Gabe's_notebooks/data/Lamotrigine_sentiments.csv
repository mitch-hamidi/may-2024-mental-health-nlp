"Informal survey: What (legal) drugs, if any, 'worked' for you?","hi! so i'm officially diagnosed, tried dbt but didn't follow through , currently in therapy twice a week (logotherapy) with okay-ish results.

i've been advised that since my bpd is fairly extreme (2 suicide attempts, self-harm, impulsive behaviour that's been costly and devastating for both home and work life), that i need to go under some type of medication. i do not present signs of schizophrenia/schizotypal behaviour however.

i have an appointment coming up, but being no strangers to meds already, i wanted to ask you what, if anything, **worked for you.**

my understanding is that there are several types of drugs, sometime used in isolation and sometimes in tandem with others, roughly falling into the following categories:

**mood stabilizers:** antiepileptics, topiramate (topamax), lamotrigine (lamictal), divalproate (depakote), lithium (to a certain extent as it's not a mood stabilizer per say), etc

**ssris:** citalopram (cipramil), dapoxetine (priligy), escitalopram (cipralex), fluoxetine (prozac or oxactin), fluvoxamine (faverin), paroxetine (seroxat), sertraline (lustral), vortioxetine (brintellix), etc

**maois:** isocarboxazid (marplan), phenelzine (nardil), selegiline (emsam), tranylcypromine (parnate)

**tricyclic antidepressants** amitriptyline (elavil, amitril, endep) , nortriptyline (pamelor, aventyl) , etc (note: these are rumored to make things worst for bpd patients)

**antianxiety agents and sedatives:** benzodiazepines of all kinds: diazipam (valium), alprazolam (xanax), temazepam (restoril), flurazepam (dalmane), and triazolam (halcion). note: these are addictive and prone to abuse in a population already prone to abuse so are rarely prescribed for bpd patients.

**antipsychotics (fgas 'first generation' neuroleptics):** thiothixene (navane), haloperidol (haldol), trifluoperazine (stelazine), flupenthixol (depixol), etc.

**atypical antipsychotics (sgas - 'second generation'):** olanzapine (zyprexa), aripiprazole (abilify), risperidone (risperdal), quetiapine (seroquel), lurasidone (latuda) , clozapine (clozaril), etc.

**opiates antagonists:** naloxone, naltrexone, nalmefene, etc (note: these are experimental in some countries)

**others:** rtms, ketamine injections, psilocybin micro-dosage, etc.

**non-medication but electronically/mechanically assisted therapy:** emdr, etc.

any recommendation would be extremely appreciated as i'm at the end of my proverbial tether. thank you so much!",1602953594,False,BPD,2020-10-17 16:53:14,"Informal survey: What (legal) drugs, if any, 'worked' for you? hi! so i'm officially diagnosed, tried dbt but didn't follow through , currently in therapy twice a week (logotherapy) with okay-ish results.

My experience with lamictal/lamotrigine,"this is going to be a very long post because i want to be thorough. when i was researching lamictal before i took it, i found it helpful to read about people's experiences, and i want to cover every aspect i can think of. so here we go.

i have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder for roughly 5 years (although i knew i had it long before that) and have always struggled to gain access to necessary medication. i was initially prescribed wellbutrin and buspirone, then later on lexapro, all of which were not even remotely helpful in managing my bpd symptoms. despite asking multiple doctors about the possibility of a mood stabilizer, my requests were rejected on the basis that i do not have a diagnosed mood disorder. i was frustrated by that, as i know many borderline folks have experienced relief from extreme mood swings and the intensity of their episodes with the use of a mood stabilizer.

two years ago i was prescribed low dose ativan, then xanax, both of which helped mildly at controlling the severity of my episodes (but not the frequency or duration of them). just to be clear, when i am referring to episodes, i mean when i am triggered past any level of higher reasoning and i exhibit temporary extreme dissociative/psychotic behaviors and that last for several hours and, on occasion, days. i know episodes look different for everyone, but i just want to be clear as this is a medical review, lol.

at long last i found a psychiatrist that recommended i start lamictal, a medication used to manage seizures in folks with epilepsy and to stabilize mood in folks with bipolar disorder. he explained to me that lamictal has very few side effects in most people, both short and long term, but that there is the possibility of developing a life threatening rash while adjusting to the medication. because of this, there is a long titration period to avoid that possibility. he also told me that in the 35 years of his practice, he has seen the greatest success rate with lamictal for borderline folks as compared to other mood stabilizers. as a side note, he also prescribed me low dose klonopin/clonazepam to help manage daily anxiety, so keep in mind that might skew my ability to accurately measure how lamictal has helped me, as i am not taking it alone. i take 0.5 mg of klonopin most days, although i do occasionally take 1 mg if i'm having a particularly bad day or an anxiety attack, and i occasionally skip a dose if i feel like i won't need it that day (aka i'm not leaving the house).

while waiting for my prescription to come in, i did some research. i was mostly interested in people's anecdotes, though i did also check out a few studies. the use of lamictal for folks with bpd is considered ""off label,"" so there isn't a tremendous amount of research in that area. i was pleasantly surprised to find that many folks consider lamictal a wonder drug and very few reported negative side effects of any kind. at worst they got the rash and therefore had to end treatment, and for others it simply did nothing. i did not read any anecdotal reports of bpd symptoms worsening. i felt confident in beginning the treatment myself.

i started off taking 25 mg for two weeks, 50 for two weeks, 75 for two weeks, 100 for one week, 150 for one week, and finally reaching the therapeutic dose of 200 mg (which is the dose i currently take).

so, on to the actual review. i have experienced zero side effects of note...no rash, no increased appetite, no more headaches than usual, no fatigue or insomnia. it has always been difficult for me to compare how i'm doing now to the past, as i experience strong emotional impermanence and have almost zero recall of how i've felt in the past to compare to how i feel now. here is what i know for sure:

while i still spiral as much as ever, i have experienced a marked reduction in the frequency and severity of my episodes. i did not notice the change until i reached 150 mg, and at 200 i feel i can actually say there's a difference.

i am used to going from 0 to 100 when there is a strong trigger, and i would say i now go from 0 to 80. that might not sound like much, but to me this is an enormous relief. i feel i have just enough time to even attempt a coping mechanism or two before the episode becomes too severe to do anything but just ""ride it out.""

my only complaint is that it takes so long to titrate up and the changes were so gradual that i personally found it very difficult to know if it was making any sort of difference. i've had to think long and hard about how i'm doing now compared to before taking it, but i feel i can say that it has been effective for me. right now i'm going through some absolutely traumatic life events, and i've managed to stay relatively calm throughout. i am grieving terribly, but so far i've only had one episode when typically i would experience them almost daily when under this amount of stress. to me, that shows a fairly dramatic change.

consider asking your doctor about lamictal if you haven't experienced any relief from other medications. it might not work for you, but beyond the rash the risk is markedly low as compared to other mood stabilizers. i feel it has been quite effective in reducing the severity of my more extreme symptoms, although i have not noticed a significant reduction of milder or comorbid symptoms (aka anxiety, low self worth, thought loops, splitting, etc). as a side note, in no way am i suggesting that that anxiety/splitting/maladative thought patterns are less impactful on daily living &amp; massively painful...but for me personally, i consider them less severe as they are a daily reality that i work to manage but do not cause me the same extreme distress that my episodes do. that's just me, though.

lamictal does not prevent me in any way from feeling triggered, but has given me some space to actually address the triggers and communicate before going nuclear and tearing my relationships to shreds. to me it isn't exactly a wonder drug, but i have been impressed with its efficacy so far.",1628777635,False,BPD,2021-08-12 14:13:55,"My experience with lamictal/lamotrigine this is going to be a very long post because i want to be thorough. when i was researching lamictal before i took it, i found it helpful to read about people's experiences, and i want to cover every aspect i can think of. so here we go.

My first time Inpatient: how I learned to advocate for myself,"hi everyone, i just got released from the hospital after the 72 hours. i signed all the papers to go in voluntarily so i could stabilize and get my meds changed in a safe environment. it's a long story about why i went in but i figured you guys could understand. i've recently been diagnosed bipolar and borderline.

so, i was previously on 40 mg of prozac, 25 mg lamictal and 10 mg buspar. prozac and buspar were part of my old ""anxiety and depression"" cocktail. the first psychiatrist i saw added 25 mg of lamictal to my regimen after my diagnosis and didn't change anything else 

after that appointment, when i got home i felt great. for all of....2 days. my body got used to the lamictal and from there on it was like eating candy. i kept taking the medicines hoping it would get better.

from there, things kept going downhill. i ended up in one of the most severe depressive episodes i've ever had while also experiencing mild psychosis. i had a lot of outlandish thoughts like i wanted to build a makeshift boat and go to india, i wanted to get to paris with a total of 60 bucks in my pocket, really weird stuff. then i talked about hanging myself.

the next day, my family had me go to counseling. my psychiatrist was contacted and told how bad things were yet refused to change my medicine and didn't call for hours. i was still in full blown crazy land so the best option was hospitalization. i agreed to it because i was so tired of feeling like i was.

the hospital was great and i loved the doctors i saw. i remember answering tons of questions. every single doctor informed me that i should not have been on any more ssris after my diagnosis. before being diagnosed, i had tried 7 ssris with little to no success or worsening of symptoms. also i was told the mood stabilizer i was on was gonna be way too slow working. 

the head psych doctor there reevaluated my whole med regimen and took me off of prozac and lamictal and she added lithium and left me on buspar which i do well with. i felt like a new person when i started lithium. it's been totally amazing so far. i have a checkup in 4 days to see my blood levels.

i'm going to do all of my follow-ups with the hospital's doctors which i feel very good about. i feel like i can trust them and they have a lot of knowledge about medications as well as what each mental illness needs to be treated with. i completely cancelled everything else i had with the prior doctor.

so, i was previously on 40 mg of prozac, 25 mg lamictal and 10 mg buspar. prozac and buspar were part of my old ""anxiety and depression"" cocktail. the first psychiatrist i saw added 25 mg of lamictal to my regimen after my diagnosis and didn't change anything else 

after that appointment, when i got home i felt great. for all of....2 days. my body got used to the lamictal and from there on it was like eating candy. i kept taking the medicines hoping it would get better.

from there, things kept going downhill. i ended up in one of the most severe depressive episodes i've ever had while also experiencing mild psychosis. i had a lot of outlandish thoughts like i wanted to build a makeshift boat and go to india, i wanted to get to paris with a total of 60 bucks in my pocket, really weird stuff. then i talked about hanging myself.

the next day, my family had me go to counseling. my psychiatrist was contacted and told how bad things were yet refused to change my medicine and didn't call for hours. i was still in full blown crazy land so the best option was hospitalization. i agreed to it because i was so tired of feeling like i was.

the hospital was great and i loved the doctors i saw. i remember answering tons of questions. every single doctor informed me that i should not have been on any more ssris after my diagnosis. before being diagnosed, i had tried 7 ssris with little to no success or worsening of symptoms. also i was told the mood stabilizer i was on was gonna be way too slow working. 

the head psych doctor there reevaluated my whole med regimen and took me off of prozac and lamictal and she added lithium and left me on buspar which i do well with. i felt like a new person when i started lithium. it's been totally amazing so far. i have a checkup in 4 days to see my blood levels.

i'm going to do all of my follow-ups with the hospital's doctors which i feel very good about. i feel like i can trust them and they have a lot of knowledge about medications as well as what each mental illness needs to be treated with. i completely cancelled everything else i had with the prior doctor.

overall though, i learned that it's okay to reach out for help. i also learned that i have to fight for myself when my medication is out of balance. it's hard when you're seeing some doctor that's second guessing you and then they leave you hanging when you're in a crisis.  i feel much stronger about advocating for myself after all of this.

Tomorrow I am seeing my doctor pertaining to my medication and I'm the most anxious I've ever been.,"okay, i just need to get this out. 

so after being diagnosed with bpd i do what i always do and that is dive straight into voraciously reading everything about the disorder. i read and comprehend more and more and more until my head is close to exploding. i've always been this way. it is a pattern close to obsessive. heh. anyway, after all of the information i've absorbed i've drawn a few conclusions about the particulars of my diagnosis. the first and foremost thing being how greatly i am affected by my emotions. the second is how i exhibit no signs of psychosis. 

i'm anxious about seeing my doctor tomorrow because i will be specifically requesting topamax or lamictal. abilify just isn't doing it and that doesn't surprise me since, as i mentioned before, i have no psychosis accompanying my diagnosis. 

i am hoping - no, *praying* and to whom i don't know since i'm an atheist, that he just doesn't try to increase my dosage of abilify. i've read about some of the side effects and how poorly patients *without* psychosis can react if the dosage increases too much. (doing so could result in something called 'tardive dyskinesia'.)

in particular i found this information, and later on [this](http://www.bpddemystified.com/treatments/) entire website, helpful:

&gt; another class of medications, referred to as mood stabilizers, has been shown to significantly reduce certain symptoms in patients with borderline disorder.27 these symptoms include impulsivity, anger, anxiety, depressed mood, and general level of functioning. the size of these therapeutic effects range from moderate to very large.
mood stabilizers do not reduce suspiciousness, split-thinking, dissociative episodes and paranoia in borderline disorder. when these symptoms persist after others improve with mood stabilizers, the addition of an antipsychotic agent is indicated.
the most commonly used and effective mood stabilizers for borderline disorder are topiramate (topamax) and lamotrigine (lamictal). these medications are also referred to as antiepileptic drugs because they are commonly used for people suffering from partial complex seizure disorder. partial complex seizure disorder has its origin in the temporal lobes of the brain, a brain region important in the generation of emotions and control of impulsive behavior.
weight gain does not appear to present a problem with topamax, which may acutally normalize weight in some patients, or with lamictal. the latter medication rarely may result in a serious dermatological problem, especially if the dose is raised too quickly.

i want to be clear that i am sharing this not just to ""get it off my chest"" but in case anyone else out there is experiencing bpd in the same way that i am. i exhibit the following:

* unstable relationships.
* unclear or unstable self image.
* impulsive, self-destructive behaviors.
* extreme emotional swings.
* explosive anger. 
* some/sporadic feelings of emptiness. (i've noticed this happens rarely.)

wish me luck? please? i usually try, and desperately so, to keep it together but i'm on the verge of tears with worrying about how tomorrow will go. it is almost 3:00am here and i should be asleep. that is probably not going to happen.

so today’s just been a mess. i had a phone appointment with my doctor today, who consulted the emergency psychiatry team, who told me to halve my dose. i was already worried about that, when the psychiatrist from my last hospital admission called me. he told me that i need to stop the medication now, and not start anything until my rash is gone.

Lamictal (Lamotrigine) + What Combination?,"okay, right now i am currently on 200mg lamotrigine a day. no side effects other than extremely tiredness, almost somnolence in the evening. which is no problem, because i have had insomnia for years. i do wake up two hours after falling asleep, then i need to go to my bathroom and take a promethazine anti-histamine i was prescribed to fall asleep, and then i sleep until about 6 in the morning (going to bed between 9:30 and waking up 06:00 in the morning.

i can feel the lamotrigine making my mood changes much better. it's still not regulated totally, i still cry from time to time, but now it's like i can't cry. which relieves me alot because i used to cry every day.

but my mood is still changing at at stage where it's still frustrating me and i'm bored to death. still got the feeling the everything i do is meaningless because we're all going to die at one time or another.
__________________________
but, the question is, anybody with bpd that get's a higher dose than 200mg a day? i take 100mg in the morning at 06:00 am and another at 06:00 pm. 12 hours between to keep blood values stable.

and anyone that just needed another medicine like an ssri or something together with lamotrigine, i read that someone needed that. but ssri's have always made me tired, fat and inactive. any ssri's with least side effects?

i also read that an anti-psychotic would work nice together with lamotrigine, especially abilify.
i am not happy about anti-psychotics because it think that i am a victim of long term side effects such as inactive libido, but maybe abilify is better than quetiapin i got for two years and became almost impossible to get an erection.

i also read that lithium does wonders for some people with unstable mood?

can anyone confirm any of this and tell me their ""wonder combination"" to get my motivation and happiness back in life?

looking forward to get some answers.

"I am intolerant to most medications, how do I cope?","i'd like to start off by saying i know medications are not a fix all cure. i have been going to therapy for the past 6 or 7 years, and am working on improving my dbt skills, but it is extremely hard without proper medication. 

i started trying to take medications when i was 16 i think, so about 6 years ago. when i was 16 to 17 i took at least 10 medications. a few i can remember are sertraline, prozac, zoloft and more. i reacted extremely badly to all of them, mostly with extreme chest pain, trouble remembering, extreme nausea, increased anxiety or depression. 

then i found paxil, i was on that for about 5 years and slowly tapered off a few months ago. i came off of it with the support of a doctor, i took all the right steps but it was still hell. i came off paxil because it was making me very sick and giving me lots of brain zaps every day. 

when i was on paxil, for the first 1 to 4 years, my mood was manageable. i would still get intense ups and downs but i could manage. unfortunately, i believe paxil was also giving me hypomanic symptoms, because now that i am off of it i do not have hypomanic episodes. 

since i came off paxil i am so suicidal i can barely function. i have recently tried abilify and lamotrigine. abilify made me more anxious than i have ever been in my life and lamotrigine gave me intense chest pain. so currently i am only taking 300mg of wellbutrin, which i have been on for about 2 or 3 months. wellbutrin makes me mildly sick, but it does help a little so i am unwilling to come off of it right now.

when i was on paxil, for the first 1 to 4 years, my mood was manageable. i would still get intense ups and downs but i could manage. unfortunately, i believe paxil was also giving me hypomanic symptoms, because now that i am off of it i do not have hypomanic episodes. 

since i came off paxil i am so suicidal i can barely function. i have recently tried abilify and lamotrigine. abilify made me more anxious than i have ever been in my life and lamotrigine gave me intense chest pain. so currently i am only taking 300mg of wellbutrin, which i have been on for about 2 or 3 months. wellbutrin makes me mildly sick, but it does help a little so i am unwilling to come off of it right now.

New medication increase and addition,"hey guys,

little bit of a back story for context:

i've been admitted to a psychiatric hospital due a recent suicide attempt.

before i was admitted i was taking 150mg venlafaxine (effexor) 200mg lamotrigine (lamictal) and 25-50 quetiapine (seroquel prn)

since my admission my doses have been increased to 225mg venlafaxine, 300 lamotrigine and 50ir seroquel and 50xr seroquel note as well as prn 10mg valium. my psych knows that i am recovering from an eating disorder so i am quite picky and choosy about what type of medications i am on, luckily i haven't gained weight since taking the prn seroquel for the past year (it can be on and off, sometimes one or two a night but then i can go two weeks without) she knows that i am concerned that i have increased the seroquel regularly at note, which she reassures me is a short term thing.

so, anyway - the reason for this post is that i have been started on 2.5mg of abilify, creating a large cocktail of medications. does anybody have any experience being on this combination and what is your story?

Lithium and Lamictal,"i've been on lithium (900mg) since 2017 and it's a pretty good base of a medication that helps my main symptoms, but not all of them.
ever since then, i've been on lithium + a thousand other combinations to control psychotic or anxiety symptoms.
since none of them seemed to work, my doctor prescribed lamictal with lithium. in case lithium just needed an extra help from another mood stabilizer.

lamictal worked wonders for me after a couple weeks and i almost forgot i had a disorder in the first place .but i go to a public psychiatric hospital and medications are free and donated, except for lamictal, and i couldn't afford it. unfortunately, i had to stop taking it and got bad for 2 weeks after it until i got somewhat stabilized again (back again with anxiety symptoms but no depression or anger). i went to the hospital again and miraculously could get back into it bc they were able to donate some for me again. but as soon as i started taking it again, i got into such a bad depression i even started cutting again after 3 years of haven't done so. i'll keep taking it since i'm starting to get better again and my psychiatrist might prescribe a higher dose of lithium and drop lamictal completely.

Currently weaning off of Effexor slowly (psychiatrist’s rec. and being monitored) but starting to feel off after a week and a half,"i’ve heard the horror stories and how it’s one of the more difficult snri’s to come off of. i’ve been on 300mg for a few years now and have just had it lowered to 225mg. 

i’m still on my lamictal (god send i swear, i was an emotionally awful person and extremely manipulative before it). 

but the depressive moods and anxiety has been slowly creeping back in.

i’m ashamed to say i’ve missed three days of work because the anxiety was so bad i couldn’t face leaving the house without shaking.

the thing is, i like my job. i like my coworkers and i’m good at my work. i have no reason to feel this way about going. 

i’ve hardly left the house and have a hard time leaving my bed. i’ve been sleeping so much.

i don’t know how much of this is from weaning off the meds, but the goal is to eventually switch me to zoloft.

i feel like i’ve tried everything. wellbutrin, celexa, gabapentin, lexapro, xanax as a prn, klonopin as a prn, seroquel and i’m just tired of the constant cocktail of meds that never seem to help.

the effexor and lamictal have been the best combo so far. but i’m really thinking it’s the mood stabilizers are what’s really working.

it took years for them to even realize i had bpd and prescribe me something for it.

i’m also thinking i’ve been showing signs of add too but my psych. thinks it’s just extreme anxiety. (i know it’s definitely not the cause, fiancé feels the same). but because i don’t talk about it often enough in sessions i’m not sure they’re getting the full picture.

i’m just tired and feeling worthless.

my fiancé has been so supportive but i feel like it’s only a matter of time before i push him away too with all the ups and downs. i feel a lot of shame.

anyone in the same boat who can share experiences or what worked for them?

I don't fit neatly into a box... but that's OK! I'm bigger and better than ANY box you put me in!,"i recently had an episode of sh, chronic emptiness, dissociation, suicidal ideation (without any real intention, just emotionless practicality). i have no clue how many times i've been down this road, but it's as familiar as it is comforting; and as saddening as it is frustrating.

i am, right here and now, a 33 year old female who, 3 years ago, moved from the uk (and utterly shit mental healthcare available on the nhs mixed with a tiny bit of privately paid for, better quality psychiatric care) to australia (private healthcare, incredible psychiatric care, therapy programmes and private hospitalisation available to me 24/7).

when i left the uk i carried with me a 'diagnosis' of possible bipolar disorder and possible bpd, but the only confirmed illness my uk doctors had been happy to label me with was major depressive disorder. i was unable to access the specialists needed in the uk to investigate bpd or bipolar further (despite having been hospitalised for a severe psychotic mania for 3 weeks at one point, and another time disappearing because of delusional thinking for a week and ending up stabbing myself in the leg), and because of this 90% of my care was via my family gp who wouldn't prescribe anything beyond antidepressants. 

as a result, from age 11 to age 29 my life was a complete catastrophe of depression, self harm, multiple suicide attempts, reckless and dangerous behaviour, law breaking, turbulent relationships and catastrophic self image. i am not exaggerating even one ounce when i say i'm genuinely baffled that i survived and didn't manage to complete a suicide attempt, get myself murdered by putting myself (all of 5ft 4 of tiny flimsy female) in horrifically dangerous situations with men i didn't know, or accidentally overdose on one of my frequent cocktails of uppers, downers, psychedelics and opiates.

at that changed when i moved to aus and got private healthcare, as that's just the way here. the move triggered a very dark depressive episode with suicidality and i was admitted to a private, specialist psychiatric hospital for the first time in my life at age 30. that's when i met my current psychiatrist and he took one look at my previous medical records from the uk, literally rolled his eyes so hard you could hear them rattle, and told me he was going to evaluate me again from scratch. i left the hospital 4 weeks later with a firm bpd diagnosis, mdd, and bipolar nos. i also had a drug regimen that included mood stabilisers and drugs to help with my anxiety.

fast forward 2.5 years. at my last psych appointment at the end of last week (emergency meeting to discuss adjusting my drug and treatment regimen after my sh episode (my first for a year, previously unheard of) my pdoc, fiancé and i finally had a really in depth discussion about diagnosis labels, and he explained that the reason he has never labelled me bipolar 1 or 2, although he would be tempted if forced to place as type 1, was for 2 reasons;

1) i seem to have an atypical reaction to antidepressants compared to the vast majority of bipolar patients, as they do not appear to push me into mania. my episodes that could be said to be manic or hypomanic appear to be unaffected by them, and fluoxetine (prozac) is actually currently a vital part of my medication regimen. 

2) secondly, even though i have had two prior episodes that he would definitely call 'manic with psychosis and/or delusional thinking', as i wasn't under his care then and have freely admitted being a raging consumer of illegal pharmaceuticals in my 20's when these both happened, he cannot with complete certainty rule out the possibility of these both having been drug induced, separate to a bipolar episode. 

i appear to have an atypical level of success with certain drugs in general; my bpd symptoms are managed quite effectively with drugs prescribed typically for bipolar disorder and in conjunction with antidepressants and anxiolytics. he thinks this is because of the severity of the depressive episodes i experience which are actually more in line with the mdd or the severity and frequency of depression experienced by type two bipolar sufferers. 

it really got me thinking that ultimately, while obviously useful to a degree in helping categorise and treat our illnesses, these labels which we are assigned for treatment purposes, have a very high risk of becoming the be-all and end-all of how we self identify. i see myself as a borderline/bipolar person, and i have this habit of viewing my entire life and all the experiences within it as being attributed to, or symptomatic of, my illnesses. 

but my psychiatrist explained to me that even he doesn't view me like that. he views me as a collection of symptoms and his job is to try to treat those symptoms in a way that best suits me. so he doesn't give a shit if sodium valproate, or lithium, or seroquel, or lamotrigine, or prozac, or propanolol, or xanax, or diazepam, or even ect (which i have had twice), or olanzapine works best for me. he doesn't care what it's 'supposed' to be prescribed for. dbt or cbt, doesn't matter as long as it helps me. he isn't hung up on labels; his job is to find a solution to best treat all of my destructive or inappropriate symptoms, and from there help me function to the best of my ability in my public and private life. he really made me realise that i shouldn't be so hung up on what my 'diagnosis' is either. we are more than a label. we are all the sum of many parts. we may identify with and relate to each other, but we are all different. our experiences ultimately don't have to fellow the same path. 

what i'm trying to say is that subs and communities like these are an amazing resource of information and comfort from similarly minded individuals. we may share many feelings and experiences. but we are not all the same. and we are not 'just' bpd, or bipolar, or depression sufferers. those are the illnesses we carry with us; but they are not us!

since that chat with my pdoc something inside me has changed. not 'and now i'm miraculously cured!' bullshit; but by changing the way i see myself, as a person first, and having illnesses second, i have been able to recover much quicker from my recent episode than i think i have before. per my pdocs suggestion, i started keeping a list of daily habits and checking them off each day (stuff i would normally do but not even think about it like get dressed, shower, eat, brush teeth etc) and i tick them off every day. it makes me mindful of the positive things i do every day to function as a good, normal human being, and to remember to give myself credit for them!! and then i write down any 'extra' things i do like leaving the house, cleaning out a cupboard or teaching one of my dogs a new trick. it helps me realise that this illness that i feel has taken over my life, hasn't actually won. i'm still inside here, in my head somewhere. i'm still me. i'm not a walking personification of my illnesses. i'm a bright, intelligent, funny, capable person. i'm sexy and i look awesome! i'm a brilliant cook, and i am an excellent 'mother' to my three fur babies. i have good hygiene and cool curly hair that people are envious of. i write well, i read interesting books, i am a fountain of seemingly useless but fascinating information. 

if you're struggling today, and feel weighted down by your diagnosis; if it feels all encompassing and it defines who you are... stop for a second. take a moment to remember that it is a collection of symptoms, and each one has a method of management. it may be something different for you than it is for anyone else. don't come to these subs and forums for the wrong reasons. don't come here to have your negative self image validated. come here for support and to take inspiration from how others find ways to cope so that you can find the right solution for you. drugs, activities, therapy, routines, meditation, creative outlets; every one of us is unique and our management techniques will be unique too. don't lose yourself in your labels. you're so much more, so many more parts than one word or an acronym, just like your illness is. when you refuse to give that label power anymore, you open your mind and your heart to taking on each symptom one at a time. and then you'll start to realise that you are far more powerful than the thing you're trying to fight. 

i want to point out i'm not claiming to be 'fixed' or even that i've gotten anything under control; this is going to take time and constant effort. two days ago i had an episode of rage over a mcdonalds drive thru order that the dumb fucks got wrong and i didn't realise 'till i got home. i smashed a few plates and kicked a hole in a door. but you know what i also did? i managed not to sh, and i still showered, brushed my teeth, walked my dogs, did a load of laundry and later on i baked some ginger biscuits. and all those things went on the 'good habits/achievements' list. 

a day later (yesterday) instead of beating myself up for the rage episode, i focussed on how i still managed to do good things that day, and how now i get to go choose a couple of new plates (maybe even a set!) from target (i love shopping), and how my fiancé went to the hardware store and bought an identical replacement door, pre painted, for $75 and had it replaced within 10 minutes, nbd. 

if you read this far, i hope my story helps you in some way to strengthen your resolve to never stop fighting, to give yourself permission to make mistakes, and to give yourself credit for even the tiniest things. because every positive and productive thing you do, even just combing your hair or washing up a cup, is one thing your illness didn't stop you doing today. start adding all those little things up, and you'll start to realise you're so much more than a mentally ill person. that doesn't mean it'll ever go away. for most of us this is for life. but it means a happier life where you are in control of your illness. not the other way around.

as a result, from age 11 to age 29 my life was a complete catastrophe of depression, self harm, multiple suicide attempts, reckless and dangerous behaviour, law breaking, turbulent relationships and catastrophic self image. i am not exaggerating even one ounce when i say i'm genuinely baffled that i survived and didn't manage to complete a suicide attempt, get myself murdered by putting myself (all of 5ft 4 of tiny flimsy female) in horrifically dangerous situations with men i didn't know, or accidentally overdose on one of my frequent cocktails of uppers, downers, psychedelics and opiates.

at that changed when i moved to aus and got private healthcare, as that's just the way here. the move triggered a very dark depressive episode with suicidality and i was admitted to a private, specialist psychiatric hospital for the first time in my life at age 30. that's when i met my current psychiatrist and he took one look at my previous medical records from the uk, literally rolled his eyes so hard you could hear them rattle, and told me he was going to evaluate me again from scratch. i left the hospital 4 weeks later with a firm bpd diagnosis, mdd, and bipolar nos. i also had a drug regimen that included mood stabilisers and drugs to help with my anxiety.

fast forward 2.5 years. at my last psych appointment at the end of last week (emergency meeting to discuss adjusting my drug and treatment regimen after my sh episode (my first for a year, previously unheard of) my pdoc, fiancé and i finally had a really in depth discussion about diagnosis labels, and he explained that the reason he has never labelled me bipolar 1 or 2, although he would be tempted if forced to place as type 1, was for 2 reasons;

1) i seem to have an atypical reaction to antidepressants compared to the vast majority of bipolar patients, as they do not appear to push me into mania. my episodes that could be said to be manic or hypomanic appear to be unaffected by them, and fluoxetine (prozac) is actually currently a vital part of my medication regimen. 

2) secondly, even though i have had two prior episodes that he would definitely call 'manic with psychosis and/or delusional thinking', as i wasn't under his care then and have freely admitted being a raging consumer of illegal pharmaceuticals in my 20's when these both happened, he cannot with complete certainty rule out the possibility of these both having been drug induced, separate to a bipolar episode. 

i appear to have an atypical level of success with certain drugs in general; my bpd symptoms are managed quite effectively with drugs prescribed typically for bipolar disorder and in conjunction with antidepressants and anxiolytics. he thinks this is because of the severity of the depressive episodes i experience which are actually more in line with the mdd or the severity and frequency of depression experienced by type two bipolar sufferers. 

it really got me thinking that ultimately, while obviously useful to a degree in helping categorise and treat our illnesses, these labels which we are assigned for treatment purposes, have a very high risk of becoming the be-all and end-all of how we self identify. i see myself as a borderline/bipolar person, and i have this habit of viewing my entire life and all the experiences within it as being attributed to, or symptomatic of, my illnesses. 

but my psychiatrist explained to me that even he doesn't view me like that. he views me as a collection of symptoms and his job is to try to treat those symptoms in a way that best suits me. so he doesn't give a shit if sodium valproate, or lithium, or seroquel, or lamotrigine, or prozac, or propanolol, or xanax, or diazepam, or even ect (which i have had twice), or olanzapine works best for me. he doesn't care what it's 'supposed' to be prescribed for. dbt or cbt, doesn't matter as long as it helps me. he isn't hung up on labels; his job is to find a solution to best treat all of my destructive or inappropriate symptoms, and from there help me function to the best of my ability in my public and private life. he really made me realise that i shouldn't be so hung up on what my 'diagnosis' is either. we are more than a label. we are all the sum of many parts. we may identify with and relate to each other, but we are all different. our experiences ultimately don't have to fellow the same path. 

what i'm trying to say is that subs and communities like these are an amazing resource of information and comfort from similarly minded individuals. we may share many feelings and experiences. but we are not all the same. and we are not 'just' bpd, or bipolar, or depression sufferers. those are the illnesses we carry with us; but they are not us!

since that chat with my pdoc something inside me has changed. not 'and now i'm miraculously cured!' bullshit; but by changing the way i see myself, as a person first, and having illnesses second, i have been able to recover much quicker from my recent episode than i think i have before. per my pdocs suggestion, i started keeping a list of daily habits and checking them off each day (stuff i would normally do but not even think about it like get dressed, shower, eat, brush teeth etc) and i tick them off every day. it makes me mindful of the positive things i do every day to function as a good, normal human being, and to remember to give myself credit for them!! and then i write down any 'extra' things i do like leaving the house, cleaning out a cupboard or teaching one of my dogs a new trick. it helps me realise that this illness that i feel has taken over my life, hasn't actually won. i'm still inside here, in my head somewhere. i'm still me. i'm not a walking personification of my illnesses. i'm a bright, intelligent, funny, capable person. i'm sexy and i look awesome! i'm a brilliant cook, and i am an excellent 'mother' to my three fur babies. i have good hygiene and cool curly hair that people are envious of. i write well, i read interesting books, i am a fountain of seemingly useless but fascinating information. 

if you're struggling today, and feel weighted down by your diagnosis; if it feels all encompassing and it defines who you are... stop for a second. take a moment to remember that it is a collection of symptoms, and each one has a method of management. it may be something different for you than it is for anyone else. don't come to these subs and forums for the wrong reasons. don't come here to have your negative self image validated. come here for support and to take inspiration from how others find ways to cope so that you can find the right solution for you. drugs, activities, therapy, routines, meditation, creative outlets; every one of us is unique and our management techniques will be unique too. don't lose yourself in your labels. you're so much more, so many more parts than one word or an acronym, just like your illness is. when you refuse to give that label power anymore, you open your mind and your heart to taking on each symptom one at a time. and then you'll start to realise that you are far more powerful than the thing you're trying to fight. 

i want to point out i'm not claiming to be 'fixed' or even that i've gotten anything under control; this is going to take time and constant effort. two days ago i had an episode of rage over a mcdonalds drive thru order that the dumb fucks got wrong and i didn't realise 'till i got home. i smashed a few plates and kicked a hole in a door. but you know what i also did? i managed not to sh, and i still showered, brushed my teeth, walked my dogs, did a load of laundry and later on i baked some ginger biscuits. and all those things went on the 'good habits/achievements' list. 

a day later (yesterday) instead of beating myself up for the rage episode, i focussed on how i still managed to do good things that day, and how now i get to go choose a couple of new plates (maybe even a set!) from target (i love shopping), and how my fiancé went to the hardware store and bought an identical replacement door, pre painted, for $75 and had it replaced within 10 minutes, nbd. 

if you read this far, i hope my story helps you in some way to strengthen your resolve to never stop fighting, to give yourself permission to make mistakes, and to give yourself credit for even the tiniest things. because every positive and productive thing you do, even just combing your hair or washing up a cup, is one thing your illness didn't stop you doing today. start adding all those little things up, and you'll start to realise you're so much more than a mentally ill person. that doesn't mean it'll ever go away. for most of us this is for life. but it means a happier life where you are in control of your illness. not the other way around.

Afraid of switching medications,"hi all,
i know this topic gets mentioned a lot, but i was looking for some support/experiences. 

i’ve been on prozac 80mgs daily for about two years now. it was the first medication i was prescribed, even before i was officially diagnosed with bpd. it has definitely helped my overall mood, but now my psychiatrist wants to stop the prozac and start something new (specifically abilify). 

my anxiety has been out of control in the last few months, and she believes the prozac may have something to do with that. i also take buspar 30mgs twice a day, which is great, but if i don’t take it my anxiety is almost crippling. 

does anyone have any experiences with abilify, or any other antidepressants that have worked for them? i’m sincerely afraid to stop the prozac because of how bad things were before i started taking it. i know i’m probably being a baby here, but any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Was recommended Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT) - My entire perception of my psych problems has shifted.,"hello everyone. little background, i'm diagnosed bipolar (personally disagree despite 3 diagnoses) &amp; have considerably severe treatment resistant depression. i also have complex ptsd and a lot of borderline traits. i've been through about 4 different therapists, completed individual dbt, and am currently in a dbt skills group. i take 300mg wellbutrin for depression and 100mg lamictal as a mood stabilizer. i no longer feel as though i am taking any medication, and i don't get out of bed until i have to go to work. my suicidal ideation is worse than ever; it seems i think about killing myself almost every 3 hours. i'm having trouble showering consistently and have disconnected from most of my friends. i torment my boyfriend almost daily despite the dbt and my seemingly constant consumption of buddhist/shambhalic texts.


needless to say, i'm afraid i'm running out of options.


i started seeing a new therapist at my dbt center this week who is trained in radically open dbt, or ro-dbt. ro-dbt has essentially the opposite goal of standard dbt, in that it encourages open emotional expression as opposed to emotion regulation, and is for ""overcontrolled"" people (cluster c - avoidant, ocd) instead of ""undercontrolled"" (b - bpd, narcissistic, etc.). because i have extreme bouts of anger to the point of screaming and breaking things, it's pretty needless to say that i've never considered this kind of therapy.


initially they thought that prolonged exposure therapy for trauma would be best, as i felt my reactions to my environment stemmed from my childhood trauma (neglect, addict parents, etc.). however, during my first session, the therapist was extremely interested in what my reactions were in response to rather than the reactions themselves. she asked me about how i can't focus when the dog makes mouth sounds, how i can't let it go if my boyfriend leaves his guitars in the center of the room, and how i can't get anything accomplished because i get so distracted by details - i.e. going to take a shower and spending 20 minutes making a ""shower playlist"" to hear the perfect songs.

this week i started seeing a new therapist at my dbt center who is trained in radically open dbt, or ro-dbt. ro-dbt has essentially the opposite goal of standard dbt, in that its emphasis is on encouraging open emotional expression as opposed to emotion regulation, and is for ""overcontrolled"" people (cluster c - avoidant, ocd) instead of ""undercontrolled"" (b - bpd, narcissistic, etc.). because i have extreme bouts of anger to the point of screaming and breaking things, it's pretty needless to say that i've never considered this kind of therapy.


initially they thought that prolonged exposure therapy for trauma would be best, as i felt my reactions to my environment stemmed from my childhood trauma (neglect, addict parents, etc.). however, during my first session, the therapist was extremely interested in what my reactions were in response to rather than the reactions themselves. she asked me about how i can't focus when the dog makes mouth sounds, how i can't let it go if my boyfriend leaves his guitars in the center of the room, and how i can't get anything accomplished because i get so distracted by details - i.e. going to take a shower and spending 20 minutes making a ""shower playlist"" to hear the perfect songs. she was especially interested in the fact that none of my friends seem to believe i have mental health problems, because aside from lapses in my social involvement, i seem fine when i’m actually around everyone, despite my many explanations and admissions of my struggles at home. i only explode around my boyfriend, never at work, never at school, never with anyone other than him and every other boyfriend. i considered this a borderline trait, but she seemed extremely surprised that i can go from a huge fight, screaming and crying, then appear at work 15 minutes later and be able to chit chat with co-workers, despite secretly wanting to die. this is generally my life, i feel very uncomfortable and different, but i’m good at being funny, talking expressively, and making self-deprecating jokes.


i know i'm uptight and can be a perfectionist, however, i haven't completed my ba because i keep dropping out (due to depression), i do and have done a lot of drugs, i drink a lot, am and have always been promiscuous and generally impulsive. perfectionists are successful, right? i'm a broke waitress. i can't even get out of bed. i give up on everything i begin. i'm also a compulsive oversharer, it's a joke among my co-workers and people that know me that i would read everyone my diary if i had the chance. i connect with people all the time. 


then the therapist asked me, “how do you feel when you’re telling people these personal things? do you feel closer to them? do you feel connected to them?” 
i realized i don’t. 


i still feel very far away from people despite my frantic attempts at intimacy. i tell them all about myself but i’ll laugh or smile when talking about childhood trauma or sexual assault. she explained that you can share without connecting, especially when your emotional expression doesn’t fit the words. i’m saying vulnerable things because i’m terrified of actually being vulnerable. this is why i drink so much socially, and why i will do drugs socially. which even so, i’ve been told i’m a reserved drunk, and that i’m a serious person albeit a very funny one. i am constantly aware of my appearance and generally find myself unattractive despite being told i’m beautiful and getting considerable attention for my appearance throughout my adult life. i’ve had an on-again-off-again eating disorder for over 10 years and a relentless preoccupation with my weight despite being .1 above the underweight bmi. i won’t try new things around people, i never feel like i let loose. if one thing goes wrong i abandon a project. i was once asked to do vocals for a band and had to drink vodka beforehand and would still be singing too quietly, i was terrified and frozen. i refuse to practice anything around anyone.



she suggested that my depression and mood disorder could possibly stem from being overly controlled, that because i can’t let loose and i feel like things absolutely have to be a certain way, i paralyze myself and can’t progress. she suggested that this is why i haven’t pursued a career and why i have never shared my creative writing. on a lighter note, that this is why i refuse to do karaoke. 


she also suggested that the reason i explode on my boyfriend, and those in the past, is because they are the ones to actually see me vulnerable. i no longer have total control over my living environment. he see me in my pajamas on the couch at noon. he sees me sleep past 1. i can’t posture myself around him. so i am scared and i resent him. he’s going to leave me because he knows what i’m actually like. 


i spent the rest of the day in shock. i’m still processing it, which is partially why i wrote this. i’m starting ro-dbt next week.

this will be long, i'm sorry 


earlier this year, i was admitted to a mental hospital and diagnosed with bpd. i was put on seroquel, 50mgs, immediate release. i liked the slight stabilization and reduction in episodes but i didn't feel like the 50mgs was doing just too much, so a few months later i talked to my psychiatrist to get it adjusted. she prescribed me an additional dose of extended release seroquel at 50mgs as well. so i was taking 100mgs, half extended, half immediate.


getting the dose upped amplified all of my negative side effects, such as dissociation, irritability, loss of sense of self, and especially weight gain. i went from 141lbs to 161 in two weeks. it just made me feel so. out of my body. worse, and in a different way, than usual. i quit taking the extended release, then saw the doctor to talk about not taking seroquel anymore. 

now i am on lamictal, or lamotrigine, and taking bigger doses each week. i took 25mg the first week, 50mg this week, etc, until i get to 100mg. at 75mg, i am to stop taking my seroquel, and instead start taking 25mg of trazodone, for my lucid dreaming/inability to fully sleep. i've done some research and saw it's qualified as an antidepressant and sedative. i've also read that it can react weird with pill form birth control, which i take (chateal)
