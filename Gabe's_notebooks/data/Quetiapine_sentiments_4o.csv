"Informal survey: What (legal) drugs, if any, 'worked' for you?","hi! so i'm officially diagnosed, tried dbt but didn't follow through , currently in therapy twice a week (logotherapy) with okay-ish results.

i've been advised that since my bpd is fairly extreme (2 suicide attempts, self-harm, impulsive behaviour that's been costly and devastating for both home and work life), that i need to go under some type of medication. i do not present signs of schizophrenia/schizotypal behaviour however.

i have an appointment coming up, but being no strangers to meds already, i wanted to ask you what, if anything, **worked for you.**

my understanding is that there are several types of drugs, sometime used in isolation and sometimes in tandem with others, roughly falling into the following categories:

**mood stabilizers:** antiepileptics, topiramate (topamax), lamotrigine (lamictal), divalproate (depakote), lithium (to a certain extent as it's not a mood stabilizer per say), etc

**ssris:** citalopram (cipramil), dapoxetine (priligy), escitalopram (cipralex), fluoxetine (prozac or oxactin), fluvoxamine (faverin), paroxetine (seroxat), sertraline (lustral), vortioxetine (brintellix), etc

**maois:** isocarboxazid (marplan), phenelzine (nardil), selegiline (emsam), tranylcypromine (parnate)

**tricyclic antidepressants** amitriptyline (elavil, amitril, endep) , nortriptyline (pamelor, aventyl) , etc (note: these are rumored to make things worst for bpd patients)

**antianxiety agents and sedatives:** benzodiazepines of all kinds: diazipam (valium), alprazolam (xanax), temazepam (restoril), flurazepam (dalmane), and triazolam (halcion). note: these are addictive and prone to abuse in a population already prone to abuse so are rarely prescribed for bpd patients.

**antipsychotics (fgas 'first generation' neuroleptics):** thiothixene (navane), haloperidol (haldol), trifluoperazine (stelazine), flupenthixol (depixol), etc.

**atypical antipsychotics (sgas - 'second generation'):** olanzapine (zyprexa), aripiprazole (abilify), risperidone (risperdal), quetiapine (seroquel), lurasidone (latuda) , clozapine (clozaril), etc.

**opiates antagonists:** naloxone, naltrexone, nalmefene, etc (note: these are experimental in some countries)

**others:** rtms, ketamine injections, psilocybin micro-dosage, etc.

**non-medication but electronically/mechanically assisted therapy:** emdr, etc.

any recommendation would be extremely appreciated as i'm at the end of my proverbial tether. thank you so much!",1602953594,False,BPD,2020-10-17 16:53:14,"Informal survey: What (legal) drugs, if any, 'worked' for you? hi! so i'm officially diagnosed, tried dbt but didn't follow through , currently in therapy twice a week (logotherapy) with okay-ish results.

What combination of meds finally worked for you? What hasn’t worked?,"right now i’m on:
prozac 40mg
wellbutrin xl 300mg
adderall 15mg 2x a day
xanax 0.5mg 1x day as needed

**meds not related to mental health**
lyrica 75mg 2x per day
vitamin d3 5000
omeprazole 20mg

i started seeing a psychiatrist and therapist in november. at that time i was put on prozac 20mg, topamax, and propranolol. i had a bad reaction to the topamax and switched to abilify which i had taken in the past. at some point in those few months we stopped the abilify, but i can’t remember why. we then increased the prozac to 40mg. 

i had a hospitalization at the end of february where we did quite a few switches with my meds. the prozac stayed the same dose. they added wellbutrin xl 150mg, vistiril, and a low dose of seroquel (50mg i believe). during my week there we increased the dose of seroquel to 150mg and then by the end of the week i was at 300mg. i was then diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. when i was discharged i continued the seroquel but decided to have my psych doctor take me off it due to nodding out during conversations etc. 

since then we have not done much change in the way of antidepressants or antipsychotics. we did however switch from vyvanse 40mg to adderall that i listed above, and then was prescribed clonzepam for a short period then moved to xanax, where i’m currently at now. 

i think overall the medications are working. the adderall helps me function significantly better than the vyvanse and the xanax is easier on me then the clonzepam. i think wellbutrin xl is what stabilized me by adding it to the prozac. now i am starting to feel that familiar dread coming in. i work from home and have begun clocking in and not doing anything, can’t clean, not taking care of myself, you know the drill. i thought it was mostly anxiety, but that’s actually pretty stable. 

i’m sorry for the long post and with it being my first post here. i was just diagnosed in november after being diagnosed with bipolar 1 with no relief. 

tl;dr been on a bunch of different meds. prozac, wellbutrin, seroquel, abilify, xanax, clonzepam. they were working but recently i have started to feel extremely depressed and ideations are creeping back.

How did antidepressants modify your behavior and cognition?,"hello, i'd like to know :

1) if you've been on antidepressants, what kind  
2) how did it modify your behavior and cognition (thoughts, side-effects, how you act, react, etc.)

my official diagnosis is adhd and bulimia (18 years of eating disorders). one social worker made me realize i'm dealing with c-ptsd. over the last ten years, i have been diagnosed with social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, dysthymia, bpd with narcissist tendencies, borderline structure, anxious-depressive tendencies, depression, anxiety, ocd, etc. (long list of diagnosis which seems to change)

the diagnosis of bpd happened after a suicide attempt while on antidepressants back then. i noticed i act ""crazy"" on them : the anger is terrible and the mood swings are intense, the suicidal thoughts are escalating, i act on impulses and i take risky decisions. one minute, i'm laughing, the other i'm crying, then i'm angry, without any external triggers... (antidepressants tested : zoloft, effexor, escitalopram, trintellix)

anti-psychotics makes me go yolo and i spend a lot of money while being super zen about it (anti-psychotics tested : seroquel, abilify, rexulti. 

without antidepressants, i am neutral -- not happy, not sad, just fine. everything is much easier, i tend to reflect before i act, but i only turn crazy when my c-ptsd is triggered (loss of energy, hopelessness, guiltiness, reliving memories, depressive state, etc.). i got back on antidepressants because of a recent rape. 

vyvanse is the only thing making me productive due to my adhd (which is believed to be a symptom of bpd for my previous therapist, but officially diagnosed nevertheless by a psychiatrist), but right now the trintellix is overriding it and i'm totally out of focus, out of control, moody, puking everyday (bulimia in remission for a long while and coming back strongly for 3 weeks straight) and putting on weight even so, skin is so itchy, hurtful and watery eyes, headaches, etc.  

i feel like i'm turning crazy, i can't control my thoughts and my apartment is a mess, and i can't find the energy/focus/control to do something about it. i'm going outside for a walk, i'm happy, i come back inside, my mood crashed and i'm crying, and i don't get it. i called my pharmacist, they're going to check with my doctor, but i want to know if it's something normal with bpd or if meds trigger in me some kind of ""bpd-like"" symptoms. i've been trying for so long to remove the diagnosis, and now i realize i do act like i am borderline on the meds...

thanks!

tldr; i think my antidepressants make me act out of character and i do believe i got the diagnosis of bpd due to it. i wonder how bpd patients actually act on antidepressants because i can't find information online, and i wonder why it triggers on me that kind of reaction. i'm normally very calm, neutral and collected.",1580496436,False,BPD,2020-01-31 18:47:16,"How did antidepressants modify your behavior and cognition? hello, i'd like to know :

Medication,"i've never posted in this sub before, but i love to read it and everyone sharing their stories in such a safe and comforting place really helps me feel less alone. what medications are you guys taking or have taken?

so some background: i'm a male, 23, currently a student. i was diagnosed 5 years ago with bdp when i turned 18 (at my university's mental health center). i have also been diagnosed with mdd (when i was 14) that was eventually changed to bipolar ii, sa, gad, and performance anxiety.

since then, i have been on many, many medications and was hospitalized a few months ago. i'm just curious what medicines everyone has been on and what's helped and what hasn't. 

here's a list of mine in order of taking them:

* **zoloft** 100mg: did nothing
* **prozac** 80 mg: too activating, made my hands tremble
* **propranolol** 10 mg: did nothing
* **ativan** 2mgx4: helped with anxiety but lowered my inhibitions and i did some crazy things on it, would also make me very emotional/depressed
* **trazodone** 200mg: really great for sleep, but didn't notice any anti-depressant effects
* **dexedrine** 5mg: almost instantaneous effects, really great for concentration, raised my mood, but sent me into a extreme rage/panic attack, felt completely out of control, effects last days after taking, felt really down afterwards, left me feeling stuck in my head with racing thoughts, felt like i would never be the same again
* **remeron** 15mg: knocked me out and i gained weight! didn't noticed enough effects to continue taking it
* **wellbutrin** 300mg: really increased my sexual drive (which is rare for me), increased my ambition, made me more outgoing, was very activating, increased racing thoughts, increased anxiety, helped with depression, made my hands tremble
* **lexapro** 20mg: gave me the worst headaches when i started, did nothing for bpd but somewhat helped the depression and anxiety
* **risperdal** 3mg: the worst medication i've ever taken, terrible memory problems, fogginess, general uneasiness
* **klonopin** 1mgx3: similar to ativan
* **seroquel** 300mg: worked great at first for my anger and rage, helped with anxiety, both social and general, but eventually i just felt numb and i gained about 10 lbs in two months, also developed a lump under my chest and started getting strange shakes. i know this is generally considered the gold standard for treating symptoms of bpd and i can understand the reasoning. i wish i didn't experience such negative side effects because it was a good drug for me.
* **paxil** 40mg: (currently still taking) is helping with depression, anxiety, anger, and suicidal thoughts. i feel more balanced and in control. i did notice an increase in appetite though, so my doctor added topamax. i do not find paxil activating.
* **gabapentin** 300mgx3: (currently still taking) helps a lot with anxiety, provides a general feeling of calmness and that everything will be okay, but does not feel like a benzo (no spaciness, no drugged out feeling)
* **topamax** 100mg: (currently still taking) not my favorite but i just started. my pdoc prescribed it to add a mood stabilizer to my regimen plus it has the positive side effect of weight loss [i have noticed significant weight loss within the last week (5 lbs)]. it leaves me feeling really foggy, with bad headaches, and slight memory loss; but i hope those side effect subside over time. 

my symptoms certainly are not gone, but i'm still in weekly therapy and i see my psychiatrist once a month as we figure out what medications could possibly help. everyday has been a challenge, but i'm in a much better place than i was a when i entered the hospital a few months ago.

Recently Diagnosed - What do I do next? My story,"hello, 

tldr: what do i do next?  recently diagnosed in the last few years with bpd ""traits"", adhd, major depressive order, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, obesity. broke up with my so of 5 years who i owned a house and adopted a dog with, been bed ridden for the last month while my new psychiatrist tries me on the medication ""wellbutrin xl"" . constantly depressed, constant insomnia followed by extreme sleeping from fatigue, struggling to clean the dishes, bathe, maintain my work schedule, wake up on time. i am trying my hardest but both my psychiatrist and psychologist think i am not trying hard enough to fix things. i struggle so much with commitment to self care. how do i start changing things in a way that only a fellow person with mental health problems could swallow in bite size chunks? i feel like days from being on mental health disability from work, meanwhile my parents want me to try to buy my ex out from the house we bought two years ago. 

* mental health problems since i was a developing teenager, was a sexually confused teenager. engaged in same sex relationships. was victim of statutory rape on numerous occasions, sexual abuse, mental abuse. still to this day am unsure of my sexuality.  came out to my parents as bisexual at 16 on peer pressure from abusers. parent's still don't talk about it to this day. recently came out to my friends as unsure (am now 27)

* at 20 family doctor tried (irresponsibly might i add) diagnosing me and medicating me. 
 
* at 22 i met the love of my life during the explosion of pokémon go. all while dealing with constant mental issues.
 
* at 23 we moved into our first apartment. it had it's ups and down's and she often had to experience my outburst which often involved me destroying my tv or other stuff in a rage 
 
* at 23 my spouse finally convinced me to try some sort of therapy with a psychotherapist 
 
* at 24 we tried our first attempt at relationship counselling, 
 
* at 25 we managed to buy a condo together somehow and we thought the housing market was awful than... it's even worse now lol
 
* at 25 i took my first (and hopefully only) disability leave from work due to mental health 
 
* at 25 i had accumulated quite the list of  medications that i've been tried on. i had been medicated on cipralex, vyvanse, straterra, seroquel, trintellix, abilify, (and lithium but i love how my doc casually keeps that information hidden), all with limited success and some had caused me to cause self harm
 
* after 8+ months of waiting for a psychiatrist referral, my useless family doctor said i still won't see one anytime soon because of the local mental hospital deemed my case not priority and that i was moved to a non mental hospital psychiatrist referral 
 
* at 25 i was admitted to the psychiatric ward of a local emergency room for planning on suicide, during my stay a psychiatrist visited once, heard what i had to say, said my family doctor was prescribing me enough abilify and trintellix to ""tranquilize a fucking horse"" i was later discharged and he gave me (not even an official) suspicion of bpd
 
* the psychiatrist from the psychiatric ward prescribed me back on abilify (atypical antipsychotic) and trintellix (anti-depressant) but on a much more reasonable dose and i seen some success on this.
 
* at this point queue me starting to go to cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) with a psychologist 
 
* after many therapy sessions i finally feel ready to gradually return to work
 
* after 4 long months of a gradual return to work and much pain from pay issues with my employer i finally feel like things are starting to click 
 
* and then.. march 2020 happens, by the 13th i am working from home. grateful to still have a job, just like everyone else i thought this might be over in a few weeks to a month. 
 
* fast forward a few months, and i am struggling with some unrelated health problems and a nurse in my doctors office says, hey you should get a blood test. so i do so.. bam diabetic type 2, skipped prediabetes and everything because my family doc missed all the warning signs, generally was overbooked and because of covid did not want to see patients in person. 
 
* at 26 still in shellshock from the diabetes diagnosis, still in the midst of covid, we made the step to adopt a puppy together and improve the flooring of the house. in retrospect this did not go over well. 
 
* at 26 i struggled daily to see the benefits of these medications as they were doing little to help me unlike how i felt initially since my psych ward discharge, gained major issues with substance abuse and was drinking alcohol, smoking weed and gambling constantly and eventually chose to stop taking the meds. my rage, depression, low frustration tolerance, mental mindblocks only increased. 
 
* still at 26, things started really going bad in our relationship. at this point i was crippled mentally, absusing alcohol, gambling paycheques away, not following any sort of guideline for my diabetes and obesity, ordering take out constantly, lashing out at everyone, refusing to go back to therapy 
* despite the pandemic, my spouse opted to leave the city for a couple of weeks to her parents to get a mental break and for me to have a reset. i had felt like this was an impossible test she had set out to me that basically felt like ""fix your shit before i come back or we are done"" 
 
* during the two weeks while she was gone, i struggled (my brother was staying with us so someone was watching over me, although my brother is an alcoholic so it was more enabling than anything else). i started getting drunk, raging out, fighting with her by text and destroying (technically) my property in the house. 

* i got very drunk one night and basically made a suicide reddit post to my local city's subreddit. i (thankfully) got doxxed by another user who found my license plate in another post and called the police. the cops showed up at my backdoor at 2am to see if i was alive and i drunkenly told them i had no idea what was going on and that i did not make a reddit post like that at all so they left. 
 
* my spouse heard of all of this from me in drunken texts shortly after and that was just about the nail in the coffin for us as a couple 
 
* at this point i once again reached out to my family doctor for a referral to a psychiatrist who said it was going to be the same wait time over again. this time thanks to a friend i found an app called ""getmaple"" that linked me up with a free and registered psychiatrist in my province within 2 weeks. i had to argue with my 60+ year old (and now soon to retire) family doctor over the course of 3 over the phone doctors appointments to convince her to write me basically a blank referral to this service. which i later basically bitched her out because i was right that this was much faster and more affective.
 
* at 26, one month before my birthday, my love of my life had to end the relationship after almost 5 years. i was so tunnel vision that i didn't even feel any emotions while she cried her eyes out knowing this is the end with someone she tried time and time again to grow old with. i just wanted her out. i didn't even care. i kept telling her something must be wrong with me because i know i should be upset as well, but something is wrong. either i am coping very well with this, or at some point down the road i will completely break down and cry 
 
* 7 days after turning 27 the day i helped her move out, i cried like i never have in my life. handing off the puppy to her broke me to my core.
 
* i've seen her and the puppy a few times since, we still want to try to stay friends but i've voiced my interest in trying to fix things. she's shows interest in this but it would have to be like starting things all over again and she's not ready to do that quite yet until she not only sees change but also sees that i've changed for the better and actually am healthier mentally. 
 
* shortly after i started meeting with this new psychiatrist, we talked in length and the one profound thing she found most is how long it took me to describe my problems clear and coherently to her.  she needed another couple of sessions of speaking with me to come to a potential diagnosis which has been adhd, with bpd traits, and major depressive disorder. she then put me on a 3 week trial dose of of wellbutrin 150mg/day and wanted to see how the trial went to evaluate the potential diagnosis 

* told my parents/family about my diagnosis. they told me ""tell your doctor to fuck off, because you had no attention problems in school"" despite me being out of highschool since 2012 and college since 2014 and struggled deeply with both. 
 
* since moving my ex out, i've never been so depressed in my life, i'm extremely fatigued, cried all that i can, basically spent a month in bed outside of work from home, struggle to leave the house, have thought about suicide but still don't want too obviously, i felt this way *before* the introduction of these meds however nothing has got any better
 
* in the last two days i've had a bit of a falling out with both my psychiatrist and my psychologist separately (they don't cross communicate which i think is silly) because they seem to believe my lethargic behaviors is because ""i am not putting the effort into this, the drugs don't fix everything and i have to meet them half way"". meanwhile i am literally crying in the session trying to explain to them that me stuck in bed is trying my hardest to meet half way. i've never felt so crippled and yet my medical help doesn't think i am trying. i *know* that the medication is not the magic pill, i just need something (like how trintellix/abilify) made me feel at first so i have the energy to fix things further. i just don't want to feel like death for one day so i can slowly try things out.
 
* in addition this i am so demoralized, i struggle to commit to any positive change to myself and i am feeling like utter shit 90% of the day. i've felt suicidal again but super duper have no interest in seeing it through. it's more of a low frustration tolerance response than anything else. i want to live to grow old with my ex somehow, and still see my dog. 
 
* since the falling out, i've had to speak with the senior psychologist as they were concerned when i left the office at the end of my session crying uncontrollably, and emailed them to ask them to cancel my appointments. i explained that i need to take a break from cbt therapy and was wondering if there was any options to talk to someone more about how and why i feel the way i do rather than just me telling my psychologist this and him working on the cbt side and basically saying i am being irrational and that i need to change my mindset 
 
* my psychiatrist has since separately echoed similar statements when i basically explained her the above, and that i just need a higher dosage of meds to help me get out of bed so i can start a plan. they keep telling me the neurotypical solutions of ""oh set timers, oh make an agenda, the meds arent gonna fix everything you have to meet it half way you aren't trying hard enough"". after much back and forth she reluctantly agreed to double my dosage of wellbutrin to 300mg/day for 9 weeks . my psychatrist thinks i should get a fitness tracker and that tracking my steps will help me somehow but i fail to see how this helps when i can't even will myself out of bed. 
 
* i've taken the last two days off work and feel so close to going back onto disability this is extremely difficult because, the house my ex and i own? i am in the process of trying to buy her out of the house because my parent's think i should try as much as possible to stay in the real estate market. we already paid for the appraisal etc for purposes of me refinancing her out. 
 
* i have no idea how to possibly afford a house if i am feeling like days from being back on disability.

What meds are you guys on?,"what worked and what didn't?

so far i've been on celexa, lexapro, paxil, zoloft, adderall, vyvanse, klonopin, xanax, gabapentin, clonidine, seroquel, wellbutrin, perphenazine.

unfortunately i can't get those (except gabapentin) anymore bc i was abusing a lot of drugs and had to go to rehab so my dr won't give me them.

Improvement with intrusive thoughts - lithium chloride supplement,"i have extensive experience with psych meds, first prescription being abilify and seroquel in 2015, then mirtazapine, wellbutrin, risperidone, cymbalta, trazodone, and more. none of the meds worked for me. last trial was of fluoxetine in november, which caused severe insomnia on only 10mg, and panic attacks. in march i also tried zembrin which is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (sri). zembrin also caused panic attacks for me and increased psychotic symptoms. i decided i don't want to touch any additional ssris, snris, nor sris.

i have also tried shrooms microdosing. i found that 1-4 gram occasional trips are better for me as microdosing makes me fatigued. while on shrooms though, a lot of thoughts came to me about reducing my caffeine intake and lithium. lithium was mentioned to me several years ago by one consulting psychiatrist, but was never prescribed. i asked my current psych about it, but she refused to prescribe it.

while i was on zembrin in march, by mid-month i started to get more paranoid and psychotic, as i was also in luteal phase of my cycle. a lot of women with mental illness experience pme - premenstrual exacerbation of symptoms. i unfortunately experience that as well. mid-march i decided to stop zembrin and any other supplements i was trying - mushroom coffee, rhodiola rosea, st. john's wort tea. i also stopped drinking coffee in general as i think it exacerbates my mood swings. i only continued with lithium orotate supplement that i purchased, but i stopped it as well as it seemed that it was causing more frequent urination. as i stopped these supplements and my period stabilized, my mental state somewhat stabilized to a point where i could better observe myself and think about what to do next. i decided that i still wanted to try lithium, but purchased a supplement which was in a different form - liquid which contains lithium chloride, instead of the lithium orotate tablets. i chose lithium chloride because there is more existing research on it than on lithium orotate. i also made homemade cbd oil from the avidekel strain.

well it has been over two months since mid-march and i've hard a lot more days which were just 'alright' instead of being a struggle with intrusive thoughts and depression. i've felt more calm and was able to read more throughout these two months, actually finished two books, on my third now. so in general a beneficial experience so far, will see how it goes.",1590019756,False,BPD,2020-05-21 00:09:16,"Improvement with intrusive thoughts - lithium chloride supplement i have extensive experience with psych meds, first prescription being abilify and seroquel in 2015, then mirtazapine, wellbutrin, risperidone, cymbalta, trazodone, and more. none of the meds worked for me. last trial was of fluoxetine in november, which caused severe insomnia on only 10mg, and panic attacks. in march i also tried zembrin which is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (sri). zembrin also caused panic attacks for me and increased psychotic symptoms. i decided i don't want to touch any additional ssris, snris, nor sris.

Rambling,"i've been on four ssris and a tca. suffice to say, shit doesn't work for me. why serotonin though? why isn't there a dopamine antidepressant? except wellbutrin. the only medication that helped me to get through each day, consistently, with minimal problems is adderall/vyanse. basically any stimulant. but i can't get that anymore because i abused benzos when i was having terrible anxiety.   


i'm just kinda rambling here but, i've been on countless meds; abilify, lexapro, zoloft, celexa, paxil, clomipramine, klonopin, xanax, clonidine, gabapentin, seroquel, perphenazine, adderall, vyvanse, and probably some more im forgetting. only ones that worked were the stimulants and the benzos. but since im labeled an addict i can't get those anymore so fuck me right.   


therapy isn't working so far, i've been isolating more and more, deeper into depression. thinking about getting a job again gives me so much anxiety as i cant work for more than a few months and its been getting worse over the years where id just call in most of the time. last job i could only do once a week. idk how to fix this problem, except for getting prescribed adderall or vyvanse again. 

i need some type of external boost of motivation to get me going. i am 29m and live at home with parents. have no money, all my friends moved away, and i barely even talk to my parents. i hate it here. honestly rehab was better, i was surrounded by people like me and made friends and had a steady routine everyday, but that isnt practical in the real world unfortunately.  


i dont know. i dont cut anymore, its pointless to me. i dont wanna kms bc i know there are things i do enjoy about being alive. but im stuck right now. my day consists of being on my computer, distracting myself from my problems all day. going out in public is exhausting. even talking to my family is exhausting.

Help with BPD meds,"just recently i started getting help for my bpd / going to therapy. i went to my gp for meds because that was basically the fastest way to get them. seeing a psychiatrist through the facility i was going to could take months because first your therapist needs to see you at least 3-4 times and determine if they think meds can help. then you see a psychiatrist a couple times for them to determine what meds to put you on. so my gp put me on wellbutrin and seroquel but the seroquel made me basically emotionless and i was being a lot meaner than usual, so i stopped taking the seroquel. my doctor basically said he couldn't prescribe me anything else and that i needed to go to a psychiatrist but that he'd talk to the facility i was at and try to get me to see a psychiatrist sooner rather than later.

fast forward a couple months i finally see a psychiatrist and she switches my wellbutrin over to the xl version (which has made my insomnia worse) and prescribed me abilify (which i've never been on and didn't really know anything about). she wanted me to wait a couple weeks before i started the abilify because she wanted to make sure switching my wellbutrin over to the xl wouldn't have any new side effects (so we could make sure that any new side-effects were because of the abilify).

anyways, so i'm supposed to start the abilify in a couple days and i was thinking about how little i knew about a potentially dangerous drug that i was going to put into my body so i started doing research about it. after reading i don't even know how many webpages on reviews, side-effects, and withdrawl i'm pretty scared of taking the abilify at this point because the side-effects and withdrawl sound horrible. plus there's apparently a dangerous reaction between the wellbutrin and abilify (according to drugs.com) i'm concerned about.

so basically, i want to hear if anyone else has any experience with this drug combination / side-effects they've personally had while on abilify / if anyone has gone through abilify withdrawl / if people think i should take it or not.

i'm on the fence at this point because i know everyone's brain &amp; body handle drugs differently and what's awful for one person can be perfectly fine for another. but, i still want to hear people's opinions on this drug, whether they think it's good or not, and what other alternatives there are for people with bpd that don't have such awful side-effects / withdrawl.

Has anyone tried Duloxetine/Cymbalta as an antidepressant with Quetiapine/Seroquel as a mood stabiliser?,"i’ve been on 150mg of quetiapine for a few years now as a mood stabiliser and it’s worked really well for me. back when the psych first prescribed it for me he also wanted me to try duloxetine as an anti depressant but after a lot of research i decided against it, mainly because of how bad the withdrawal can be coming off it. i had recently come off venlafaxine which was absolute hell and didn’t really want to go through that again if the duloxetine didn’t work out for me. 

but recently i’ve been struggling even though i have made improvements &amp; worked a lot on my recovery, it feels like no matter what i do i always end up hitting a wall of depression that i just can’t get past. so i’m considering trying duloxetine and at least i can be prepared for a rough time coming off it if it doesn’t work but i’m also worried about the side effects whilst on it and how it will interact with the quetiapine too. 

has anyone been on both of these meds? what has your experience been (good or bad)?

I’m so sick of medication!,"i can’t fucking do this shit anymore with these stupid meds. 

i’ve been on so many. i’ve tried zoloft, and effexor, and prozac, and wellbutrin, and paxil.... that’s just the antidepressants. i currently take celexa which is helpful at least. took four years but i found one i guess. 

and antipsychotics! i’ve been on abilify and seroquel and zyprexa.... currently, i take risperidone. once i found the one that works, i had to figure out dosage, which it feels like is never solved. i’ve been on it for four years and i literally just had another dose change and i’m so sick of it. 

and other meds too.... i’ve taken trazodone and zopoclone and melatonin for sleep, metformin for my diabetes...

this brings me to lamotrigine. i started it four weeks ago, and three weeks ago broke out in a rash on my face. it’s spread to the rest of my body since then, coming and going, but it’s currently worst on my face. i woke up today and these stupid lumps are in my mouth too, all over my bottom lip. 

so today’s just been a mess. i had a phone appointment with my doctor today, who consulted the emergency psychiatry team, who told me to halve my dose. i was already worried about that, when the psychiatrist from my last hospital admission called me. he told me that i need to stop the medication now, and not start anything until my rash is gone.

this brings me to lamotrigine. i started it four weeks ago, and three weeks ago broke out in a rash on my face. it’s spread to the rest of my body since then, coming and going, but it’s currently worst on my face. i woke up today and these stupid lumps are in my mouth too, all over my bottom lip. 

so today’s just been a mess. i had a phone appointment with my doctor today, who consulted the emergency psychiatry team, who told me to halve my dose. i was already worried about that, when the psychiatrist from my last hospital admission called me. he told me that i need to stop the medication now, and not start anything until my rash is gone.

im planning on going off my meds,"hi 18f here 

i have suffered from revenge bedtime procrastination for as long as i can remember, a couple years before high school it started affecting my school attendance, so my psychiatrist started experimenting with medication, we tried a bunch of medication and next to every antipsychotic but the only thing that worked was seroquel, so for awhile everything was perfect, and then the tolerance development, so dose increasage, right? well before i know it i’m on hundreds of mg of quetiapine and i don’t remember what it’s like to not be on it. 

my psychiatrist would as in sessions if we thought the seroquel was doing anything for my mood... my parents always said it most definitely made an improvement but i could never see that, until i attempted to go off of it for the first time.

i’ve always struggled with my temper. i’ve always had so much rage. i’ve worked hard my entire life to control and have cake a long way, but once my seroquel levels lowered it was like all that time in therapy and time learning how to control my rage through life experiences went out the window and i was as bad as i was when i was 10, the rage that flowed through my body wasn’t just detrimental to everyone it was affecting around me, but my mentality- let’s just say i quickly started taking my medicine again. 

but a dying question of mine i’ve had for so long has been; is it withdrawals or is it me actually needing to be on seroquel? 

i always had a love hate relationship with seroquel, as it’s made me gain a lot of weight, and as someone with an eating disorder that hasn’t been easy, but after a couple times trying to get off it and everything going to shit, i quickly became a strong advocate for my usage of seroquel, as it became crystal clear shit hit the fan when i didnt take it, i remember one time i had been formed into the psychiatric unit at the hospital and my meds hadn’t been approved by the doctor yet and i started crying and begging them “please just give me my quetiapine, bad things happen when i don’t take it”. 

with age i started getting into the drug scene and i didn’t want to take it every night for the simple reason i didn’t want to sleep every night, i wanted to stay up doing meth with my fellow users. i soon learned how far i could push it, i learned i could not take it for two nights without feeling differently, but on the third night without seroquel things slowly start to decline until around the fourth day mark without it when i usually enter crisis mode, and with a growing meth addiction it quickly turned my routine into taking my seroquel every third night only.

slowly the mindset has morphed into; do i really need it at all? to explain my pea brains logic on this i need to talk more about addiction, sorry, with a raging meth addiction, i don’t want to fight the urge to resist sleep, and the meth fights against the seroquel in every way possible, not just sleep wise, wouldn’t it be better to get off the shit? see if maybe it changes my energy levels? 

and then ontop of that i can save the dosages i’m not taking for an emergency suicide plan incase my cat dies or something 

i’m going off it in a couple days and i’m not telling anyone other then you guys 

for the longest time i’ve felt as though my psychiatrist has just given me another drug addiction/dependency and o want to be free of seroquel

so   a couple of weeks ago, i   attempted suicide, and was admitted to a   mental hospital, but later   discharged. i've had to go to therapy   recently, and will be fully   assessed next week for a psychiatric   disorder. i've already been   diagnosed with major depressive disorder,   but ssris don't work, and   therapy doesn't begin to scratch the  surface.

the  suicide attempt was  one involving a combination of opiates with    benzodiazepines. no  diagnosis was made around this time because the docs  had to be sure  they were talking to someone undrugged, and i'm very    proud to say  i've been completely sober ever since.

i     used to abuse drugs a lot in the past, mainly psychedelics. at this     moment in time, i am the most depressed i have ever been, can't  sleep,    can't eat, and can't concentrate. it's been like this for the  past  three   weeks, since the suicide attempt (although, i've always  been   depressed,  it's never been this bad). i \*heavily\* suspect that i  have   borderline  personality disorder, and so do my family and  friends. i   match every  single symptom, and have never come across  anything which   describes me  so well before. however, because i am  only 17, i cannot be   diagnosed  with bpd (only a few months until i'm  18, so i'm not sure   how this makes  sense). i do remember having a  period, last december,   which lasted for  about 6 days, wherein i  thought i was almighty,   powerful, i started to  believe that i was the  antichrist, i was the   most happy i've ever been, i  didn't need nor  want sleep, according to   friends, was talking \*way\*  more than i  usually do, was doing way more   activity etc. i only  remembered this a  couple of days ago, after coming   off the phone with my  friend who  was enquiring to see how i was  doing.  she reminded me of it,  and told  me it was then that she thought  i  needed some medical help.  but  until this suicide attempt, i have  not  pursued any. after looking   online, it would appear that this  episode  constitutes as a ""hypomanic""   episode, and given that i almost  always  feel depressed, could it be  that  i have bipolar ii (perhaps in   conjunction with bpd?). i often  get very  angry, very quickly, and it's   out of my control. especially  when it  comes to over people. i would   list all of my symptoms, but  let's just  say it's like reading the dsm   description of borderline  personality  disorder. i also experience   auditory hallucinations (not  psychotic  though, they have been   identified as pseudo-hallucinations  caused by  stress).

in   my  history of drug  use, i only ever found one drug that worked for  me,   properly. i came  across this drug whilst looking for a sleep aid,  and   acquired it  \*without\* prescription. the drug was seroquel   (quetiapine).  this drug  was absolutely astonishing. i took 200mg at   night, for  sleep, but  noticed that within a couple days of use - i was   wayyyy less  irritable,  way less depressed, way less likely to get   angry and just  more normal in  general. unfortunately, i was only able   to use it for  about 8 days. but  those 8 days, i felt like an actual   person, someone  who was normal.  ssris have never worked for me, ever   before.

anyway,  my therapist is   \*very\* dismissive of me coming up with conclusions   about my own mental   health. she was very dismissive of my suspicion of   having bpd,   although, every consultant i've met with has basically   agreed with me.   when i was being assessed for psychosis, the assessor   remarked that   it was very possible that i had emerging borderline   personality   disorder. anyway, given that i have a history of drug abuse,   most of   the time, if i bring up a medication, it gets instantly   dismissed as   me 'looking for a fix'. i've got to make it clear, i didn't   find   seroquel recreational at all. it made me really sleepy too, but,   for   once, i actually felt 'fixed', or at least 'managed'. so my  question    is this: do i bring up this with my therapist tomorrow (have  never told    them about using seroquel before), or should i wait for my  actual    psychiatric assessment? if the latter, how should i approach the  topic    with my psychiatrist. docs in my area are pretty cautious about   giving   out meds to people under 18, but i've read everywhere that   seroquel  is  often used for bipolar disorder, and as an add-on  treatment  for   treatment resistant depression.

i've    tried, prescribed, two anti-depressants (which made things worse   even   after the common 3 week period), these being fluoxetine and   citalopram.  and illegally, have pretty much  tried a drug from every   class. lsd,  shrooms, many psychedelic research  chemicals, dmt,   amphetamine,  methylphenidate, mdma, codeine,  dihydrocodeine, tramadol,   benzos  (etizolam, alprazolam, valium). pretty  much every common drug   apart  from heroin, meth, all the really bad ones.  but, even   psychedelics  didn't help me with my depression.

what    shoud i do ? i really think seroquel xr  could be the answer, but   don't know how to bring it up with my  psychiatrist without coming   across as suspcious.  thank you &lt;3",1565031803,False,BPD,2019-08-05 19:03:23,"Need Advice already posted on a few over sub-reddits, figured i should post here too.

New medication increase and addition,"hey guys,

little bit of a back story for context:

i've been admitted to a psychiatric hospital due a recent suicide attempt.

before i was admitted i was taking 150mg venlafaxine (effexor) 200mg lamotrigine (lamictal) and 25-50 quetiapine (seroquel prn)

since my admission my doses have been increased to 225mg venlafaxine, 300 lamotrigine and 50ir seroquel and 50xr seroquel note as well as prn 10mg valium. my psych knows that i am recovering from an eating disorder so i am quite picky and choosy about what type of medications i am on, luckily i haven't gained weight since taking the prn seroquel for the past year (it can be on and off, sometimes one or two a night but then i can go two weeks without) she knows that i am concerned that i have increased the seroquel regularly at note, which she reassures me is a short term thing.

so, anyway - the reason for this post is that i have been started on 2.5mg of abilify, creating a large cocktail of medications. does anybody have any experience being on this combination and what is your story?

[Question/Serious/Medication] How much seroquel to prozac is needed to prevent mania?,"i started taking psychiatric medication 2 weeks ago. i was diagnosed with bpd traits in crisis and gad. 

since there's a lot of bi-polar in my family, the psychiatrist said he has to give me a ""mood stabilizer"" (anti-psychotic) along with the anti-depressant to prevent triggering a manic episode.

the problem is the first mood stabilizer he gave me was risperidal, which was to start at .5 mg then 1mg the next week and 1.5 mg the week after along with the prozac starting from 10mg the first week to 20 mg the next and 30 mg the following week, do they'd both be increasing at the same time. i suppose the ratio would be right for the stimulant to anti-psychotic.

long story short, the risperidal was garbage for me so it was lowered by a hospital emergency doctor to .25(not a psychiatrist since i don't have one - i only saw an emergency hospital psychiatrist once for my prescription and diagnosis). 

that didn't work, so i was switched to seroquel 25 mg. 

it's good but i'm just tired. i don't think the dose is high enough. do you think i should be taking 150 mg of seroquel with my current dose of 30 mg of prozac to prevent mania? i'm afraid i should be taking more of the mood stabilizer like the psychiatrist suggested.

after my family doctor appointment next week i'm supposed to be brought up to 40 mg of prozac. i want a psychiatrist but i'm afraid she won't give me a reference for one since she was mad that i even got my prescription from a psychiatrist in the first place.

the problem is the first mood stabilizer he gave me was risperidal, which was to start at .5 mg then 1mg the next week and 1.5 mg the week after along with the prozac starting from 10mg the first week to 20 mg the next and 30 mg the following week, do they'd both be increasing at the same time. i suppose the ratio would be right for the stimulant to anti-psychotic.

long story short, the risperidal was garbage for me so it was lowered by a hospital emergency doctor to .25(not a psychiatrist since i don't have one - i only saw an emergency hospital psychiatrist once for my prescription and diagnosis). 

that didn't work, so i was switched to seroquel 25 mg. 

it's good but i'm just tired. i don't think the dose is high enough. do you think i should be taking 150 mg of seroquel with my current dose of 30 mg of prozac to prevent mania? i'm afraid i should be taking more of the mood stabilizer like the psychiatrist suggested.

after my family doctor appointment next week i'm supposed to be brought up to 40 mg of prozac. i want a psychiatrist but i'm afraid she won't give me a reference for one since she was mad that i even got my prescription from a psychiatrist in the first place.

Feeling like a zombie under Abilify and Effexor,"hi! 

i've been diagnosed with bpd about a year ago and since then i've tried a fair share of medicines to try and cope with it. to name a few, i've tried fluoxetine, bupropion, escitalopram, desvenlafaxine, olanzapine, velija and topiramate, with varying levels of success. i'm currently on aripiprazole and venlafaxine, which so far is what has worked the best.

however, aripiprazole makes me feel like a zombie and not at all like myself, and olanzapine had the same effect. i feel as though i can't connect with my own thoughts and feelings, no matter how hard i try, and although my head is clear of intrusive thoughts and have had no intense mood swings ever since starting the treatment, it's making me feel awful. i used to be hyper and upbeat, and now i have a hard time getting excited about anything. my boyfriend confirms that i'm not acting the same and that i don't seem to express myself as much as i used to. i have a really hard time talking and venting, and that's all i used to do before starting the treatment. a friend who i hadn't hung out with in years says i look like i'm in slow motion compared to how i used to act. it's awful to feel like you're slipping away from yourself.

i've been thinking about trying seroquel, but would like to hear from you guys first and know if i should expect the same zombie-like feeling i've been experiencing with other drugs. i appreciate any help or advice you're willing to lend me.

Currently weaning off of Effexor slowly (psychiatrist’s rec. and being monitored) but starting to feel off after a week and a half,"i’ve heard the horror stories and how it’s one of the more difficult snri’s to come off of. i’ve been on 300mg for a few years now and have just had it lowered to 225mg. 

i’m still on my lamictal (god send i swear, i was an emotionally awful person and extremely manipulative before it). 

but the depressive moods and anxiety has been slowly creeping back in.

i’m ashamed to say i’ve missed three days of work because the anxiety was so bad i couldn’t face leaving the house without shaking.

the thing is, i like my job. i like my coworkers and i’m good at my work. i have no reason to feel this way about going. 

i’ve hardly left the house and have a hard time leaving my bed. i’ve been sleeping so much.

i don’t know how much of this is from weaning off the meds, but the goal is to eventually switch me to zoloft.

i feel like i’ve tried everything. wellbutrin, celexa, gabapentin, lexapro, xanax as a prn, klonopin as a prn, seroquel and i’m just tired of the constant cocktail of meds that never seem to help.

the effexor and lamictal have been the best combo so far. but i’m really thinking it’s the mood stabilizers are what’s really working.

it took years for them to even realize i had bpd and prescribe me something for it.

i’m also thinking i’ve been showing signs of add too but my psych. thinks it’s just extreme anxiety. (i know it’s definitely not the cause, fiancé feels the same). but because i don’t talk about it often enough in sessions i’m not sure they’re getting the full picture.

i’m just tired and feeling worthless.

my fiancé has been so supportive but i feel like it’s only a matter of time before i push him away too with all the ups and downs. i feel a lot of shame.

anyone in the same boat who can share experiences or what worked for them?

temporarily therapy is not available, as she's just lost her job, so yeah.  


here's the list of meds that she's tried for the past... 4 years i believe? i'll be using substances and not names of the drug as we are from europe, names differ everywhere:

currently she's on lamotrygine + fluvoxamine and quetiapine for sleep. she said that she felt the best on clomipramine, but the side effects (no poop for weeks, literally) were out of control, even for gastroenterologist.

i just want to hear some feedback, inside from people struggling with the same and obviously every brain is different and i'm not asking it in order to self medicate, but rather gather opinion for psychiatrist to talk it over, maybe figure something that will finally get my friend some peace of mind.

I don't fit neatly into a box... but that's OK! I'm bigger and better than ANY box you put me in!,"i recently had an episode of sh, chronic emptiness, dissociation, suicidal ideation (without any real intention, just emotionless practicality). i have no clue how many times i've been down this road, but it's as familiar as it is comforting; and as saddening as it is frustrating.

i am, right here and now, a 33 year old female who, 3 years ago, moved from the uk (and utterly shit mental healthcare available on the nhs mixed with a tiny bit of privately paid for, better quality psychiatric care) to australia (private healthcare, incredible psychiatric care, therapy programmes and private hospitalisation available to me 24/7).

when i left the uk i carried with me a 'diagnosis' of possible bipolar disorder and possible bpd, but the only confirmed illness my uk doctors had been happy to label me with was major depressive disorder. i was unable to access the specialists needed in the uk to investigate bpd or bipolar further (despite having been hospitalised for a severe psychotic mania for 3 weeks at one point, and another time disappearing because of delusional thinking for a week and ending up stabbing myself in the leg), and because of this 90% of my care was via my family gp who wouldn't prescribe anything beyond antidepressants. 

as a result, from age 11 to age 29 my life was a complete catastrophe of depression, self harm, multiple suicide attempts, reckless and dangerous behaviour, law breaking, turbulent relationships and catastrophic self image. i am not exaggerating even one ounce when i say i'm genuinely baffled that i survived and didn't manage to complete a suicide attempt, get myself murdered by putting myself (all of 5ft 4 of tiny flimsy female) in horrifically dangerous situations with men i didn't know, or accidentally overdose on one of my frequent cocktails of uppers, downers, psychedelics and opiates.

at that changed when i moved to aus and got private healthcare, as that's just the way here. the move triggered a very dark depressive episode with suicidality and i was admitted to a private, specialist psychiatric hospital for the first time in my life at age 30. that's when i met my current psychiatrist and he took one look at my previous medical records from the uk, literally rolled his eyes so hard you could hear them rattle, and told me he was going to evaluate me again from scratch. i left the hospital 4 weeks later with a firm bpd diagnosis, mdd, and bipolar nos. i also had a drug regimen that included mood stabilisers and drugs to help with my anxiety.

fast forward 2.5 years. at my last psych appointment at the end of last week (emergency meeting to discuss adjusting my drug and treatment regimen after my sh episode (my first for a year, previously unheard of) my pdoc, fiancé and i finally had a really in depth discussion about diagnosis labels, and he explained that the reason he has never labelled me bipolar 1 or 2, although he would be tempted if forced to place as type 1, was for 2 reasons;

1) i seem to have an atypical reaction to antidepressants compared to the vast majority of bipolar patients, as they do not appear to push me into mania. my episodes that could be said to be manic or hypomanic appear to be unaffected by them, and fluoxetine (prozac) is actually currently a vital part of my medication regimen. 

2) secondly, even though i have had two prior episodes that he would definitely call 'manic with psychosis and/or delusional thinking', as i wasn't under his care then and have freely admitted being a raging consumer of illegal pharmaceuticals in my 20's when these both happened, he cannot with complete certainty rule out the possibility of these both having been drug induced, separate to a bipolar episode. 

i appear to have an atypical level of success with certain drugs in general; my bpd symptoms are managed quite effectively with drugs prescribed typically for bipolar disorder and in conjunction with antidepressants and anxiolytics. he thinks this is because of the severity of the depressive episodes i experience which are actually more in line with the mdd or the severity and frequency of depression experienced by type two bipolar sufferers. 

it really got me thinking that ultimately, while obviously useful to a degree in helping categorise and treat our illnesses, these labels which we are assigned for treatment purposes, have a very high risk of becoming the be-all and end-all of how we self identify. i see myself as a borderline/bipolar person, and i have this habit of viewing my entire life and all the experiences within it as being attributed to, or symptomatic of, my illnesses. 

but my psychiatrist explained to me that even he doesn't view me like that. he views me as a collection of symptoms and his job is to try to treat those symptoms in a way that best suits me. so he doesn't give a shit if sodium valproate, or lithium, or seroquel, or lamotrigine, or prozac, or propanolol, or xanax, or diazepam, or even ect (which i have had twice), or olanzapine works best for me. he doesn't care what it's 'supposed' to be prescribed for. dbt or cbt, doesn't matter as long as it helps me. he isn't hung up on labels; his job is to find a solution to best treat all of my destructive or inappropriate symptoms, and from there help me function to the best of my ability in my public and private life. he really made me realise that i shouldn't be so hung up on what my 'diagnosis' is either. we are more than a label. we are all the sum of many parts. we may identify with and relate to each other, but we are all different. our experiences ultimately don't have to fellow the same path. 

what i'm trying to say is that subs and communities like these are an amazing resource of information and comfort from similarly minded individuals. we may share many feelings and experiences. but we are not all the same. and we are not 'just' bpd, or bipolar, or depression sufferers. those are the illnesses we carry with us; but they are not us!

since that chat with my pdoc something inside me has changed. not 'and now i'm miraculously cured!' bullshit; but by changing the way i see myself, as a person first, and having illnesses second, i have been able to recover much quicker from my recent episode than i think i have before. per my pdocs suggestion, i started keeping a list of daily habits and checking them off each day (stuff i would normally do but not even think about it like get dressed, shower, eat, brush teeth etc) and i tick them off every day. it makes me mindful of the positive things i do every day to function as a good, normal human being, and to remember to give myself credit for them!! and then i write down any 'extra' things i do like leaving the house, cleaning out a cupboard or teaching one of my dogs a new trick. it helps me realise that this illness that i feel has taken over my life, hasn't actually won. i'm still inside here, in my head somewhere. i'm still me. i'm not a walking personification of my illnesses. i'm a bright, intelligent, funny, capable person. i'm sexy and i look awesome! i'm a brilliant cook, and i am an excellent 'mother' to my three fur babies. i have good hygiene and cool curly hair that people are envious of. i write well, i read interesting books, i am a fountain of seemingly useless but fascinating information. 

if you're struggling today, and feel weighted down by your diagnosis; if it feels all encompassing and it defines who you are... stop for a second. take a moment to remember that it is a collection of symptoms, and each one has a method of management. it may be something different for you than it is for anyone else. don't come to these subs and forums for the wrong reasons. don't come here to have your negative self image validated. come here for support and to take inspiration from how others find ways to cope so that you can find the right solution for you. drugs, activities, therapy, routines, meditation, creative outlets; every one of us is unique and our management techniques will be unique too. don't lose yourself in your labels. you're so much more, so many more parts than one word or an acronym, just like your illness is. when you refuse to give that label power anymore, you open your mind and your heart to taking on each symptom one at a time. and then you'll start to realise that you are far more powerful than the thing you're trying to fight. 

i want to point out i'm not claiming to be 'fixed' or even that i've gotten anything under control; this is going to take time and constant effort. two days ago i had an episode of rage over a mcdonalds drive thru order that the dumb fucks got wrong and i didn't realise 'till i got home. i smashed a few plates and kicked a hole in a door. but you know what i also did? i managed not to sh, and i still showered, brushed my teeth, walked my dogs, did a load of laundry and later on i baked some ginger biscuits. and all those things went on the 'good habits/achievements' list. 

a day later (yesterday) instead of beating myself up for the rage episode, i focussed on how i still managed to do good things that day, and how now i get to go choose a couple of new plates (maybe even a set!) from target (i love shopping), and how my fiancé went to the hardware store and bought an identical replacement door, pre painted, for $75 and had it replaced within 10 minutes, nbd. 

if you read this far, i hope my story helps you in some way to strengthen your resolve to never stop fighting, to give yourself permission to make mistakes, and to give yourself credit for even the tiniest things. because every positive and productive thing you do, even just combing your hair or washing up a cup, is one thing your illness didn't stop you doing today. start adding all those little things up, and you'll start to realise you're so much more than a mentally ill person. that doesn't mean it'll ever go away. for most of us this is for life. but it means a happier life where you are in control of your illness. not the other way around.

I'm bigger and better than ANY box you put me in! i recently had an episode of sh, chronic emptiness, dissociation, suicidal ideation (without any real intention, just emotionless practicality). i have no clue how many times i've been down this road, but it's as familiar as it is comforting; and as saddening as it is frustrating.

i am, right here and now, a 33 year old female who, 3 years ago, moved from the uk (and utterly shit mental healthcare available on the nhs mixed with a tiny bit of privately paid for, better quality psychiatric care) to australia (private healthcare, incredible psychiatric care, therapy programmes and private hospitalisation available to me 24/7).

when i left the uk i carried with me a 'diagnosis' of possible bipolar disorder and possible bpd, but the only confirmed illness my uk doctors had been happy to label me with was major depressive disorder. i was unable to access the specialists needed in the uk to investigate bpd or bipolar further (despite having been hospitalised for a severe psychotic mania for 3 weeks at one point, and another time disappearing because of delusional thinking for a week and ending up stabbing myself in the leg), and because of this 90% of my care was via my family gp who wouldn't prescribe anything beyond antidepressants. 

as a result, from age 11 to age 29 my life was a complete catastrophe of depression, self harm, multiple suicide attempts, reckless and dangerous behaviour, law breaking, turbulent relationships and catastrophic self image. i am not exaggerating even one ounce when i say i'm genuinely baffled that i survived and didn't manage to complete a suicide attempt, get myself murdered by putting myself (all of 5ft 4 of tiny flimsy female) in horrifically dangerous situations with men i didn't know, or accidentally overdose on one of my frequent cocktails of uppers, downers, psychedelics and opiates.

at that changed when i moved to aus and got private healthcare, as that's just the way here. the move triggered a very dark depressive episode with suicidality and i was admitted to a private, specialist psychiatric hospital for the first time in my life at age 30. that's when i met my current psychiatrist and he took one look at my previous medical records from the uk, literally rolled his eyes so hard you could hear them rattle, and told me he was going to evaluate me again from scratch. i left the hospital 4 weeks later with a firm bpd diagnosis, mdd, and bipolar nos. i also had a drug regimen that included mood stabilisers and drugs to help with my anxiety.

fast forward 2.5 years. at my last psych appointment at the end of last week (emergency meeting to discuss adjusting my drug and treatment regimen after my sh episode (my first for a year, previously unheard of) my pdoc, fiancé and i finally had a really in depth discussion about diagnosis labels, and he explained that the reason he has never labelled me bipolar 1 or 2, although he would be tempted if forced to place as type 1, was for 2 reasons;

1) i seem to have an atypical reaction to antidepressants compared to the vast majority of bipolar patients, as they do not appear to push me into mania. my episodes that could be said to be manic or hypomanic appear to be unaffected by them, and fluoxetine (prozac) is actually currently a vital part of my medication regimen. 

2) secondly, even though i have had two prior episodes that he would definitely call 'manic with psychosis and/or delusional thinking', as i wasn't under his care then and have freely admitted being a raging consumer of illegal pharmaceuticals in my 20's when these both happened, he cannot with complete certainty rule out the possibility of these both having been drug induced, separate to a bipolar episode. 

i appear to have an atypical level of success with certain drugs in general; my bpd symptoms are managed quite effectively with drugs prescribed typically for bipolar disorder and in conjunction with antidepressants and anxiolytics. he thinks this is because of the severity of the depressive episodes i experience which are actually more in line with the mdd or the severity and frequency of depression experienced by type two bipolar sufferers. 

it really got me thinking that ultimately, while obviously useful to a degree in helping categorise and treat our illnesses, these labels which we are assigned for treatment purposes, have a very high risk of becoming the be-all and end-all of how we self identify. i see myself as a borderline/bipolar person, and i have this habit of viewing my entire life and all the experiences within it as being attributed to, or symptomatic of, my illnesses. 

but my psychiatrist explained to me that even he doesn't view me like that. he views me as a collection of symptoms and his job is to try to treat those symptoms in a way that best suits me. so he doesn't give a shit if sodium valproate, or lithium, or seroquel, or lamotrigine, or prozac, or propanolol, or xanax, or diazepam, or even ect (which i have had twice), or olanzapine works best for me. he doesn't care what it's 'supposed' to be prescribed for. dbt or cbt, doesn't matter as long as it helps me. he isn't hung up on labels; his job is to find a solution to best treat all of my destructive or inappropriate symptoms, and from there help me function to the best of my ability in my public and private life. he really made me realise that i shouldn't be so hung up on what my 'diagnosis' is either. we are more than a label. we are all the sum of many parts. we may identify with and relate to each other, but we are all different. our experiences ultimately don't have to fellow the same path. 

what i'm trying to say is that subs and communities like these are an amazing resource of information and comfort from similarly minded individuals. we may share many feelings and experiences. but we are not all the same. and we are not 'just' bpd, or bipolar, or depression sufferers. those are the illnesses we carry with us; but they are not us!

since that chat with my pdoc something inside me has changed. not 'and now i'm miraculously cured!' bullshit; but by changing the way i see myself, as a person first, and having illnesses second, i have been able to recover much quicker from my recent episode than i think i have before. per my pdocs suggestion, i started keeping a list of daily habits and checking them off each day (stuff i would normally do but not even think about it like get dressed, shower, eat, brush teeth etc) and i tick them off every day. it makes me mindful of the positive things i do every day to function as a good, normal human being, and to remember to give myself credit for them!! and then i write down any 'extra' things i do like leaving the house, cleaning out a cupboard or teaching one of my dogs a new trick. it helps me realise that this illness that i feel has taken over my life, hasn't actually won. i'm still inside here, in my head somewhere. i'm still me. i'm not a walking personification of my illnesses. i'm a bright, intelligent, funny, capable person. i'm sexy and i look awesome! i'm a brilliant cook, and i am an excellent 'mother' to my three fur babies. i have good hygiene and cool curly hair that people are envious of. i write well, i read interesting books, i am a fountain of seemingly useless but fascinating information. 

if you're struggling today, and feel weighted down by your diagnosis; if it feels all encompassing and it defines who you are... stop for a second. take a moment to remember that it is a collection of symptoms, and each one has a method of management. it may be something different for you than it is for anyone else. don't come to these subs and forums for the wrong reasons. don't come here to have your negative self image validated. come here for support and to take inspiration from how others find ways to cope so that you can find the right solution for you. drugs, activities, therapy, routines, meditation, creative outlets; every one of us is unique and our management techniques will be unique too. don't lose yourself in your labels. you're so much more, so many more parts than one word or an acronym, just like your illness is. when you refuse to give that label power anymore, you open your mind and your heart to taking on each symptom one at a time. and then you'll start to realise that you are far more powerful than the thing you're trying to fight. 

i want to point out i'm not claiming to be 'fixed' or even that i've gotten anything under control; this is going to take time and constant effort. two days ago i had an episode of rage over a mcdonalds drive thru order that the dumb fucks got wrong and i didn't realise 'till i got home. i smashed a few plates and kicked a hole in a door. but you know what i also did? i managed not to sh, and i still showered, brushed my teeth, walked my dogs, did a load of laundry and later on i baked some ginger biscuits. and all those things went on the 'good habits/achievements' list. 

a day later (yesterday) instead of beating myself up for the rage episode, i focussed on how i still managed to do good things that day, and how now i get to go choose a couple of new plates (maybe even a set!) from target (i love shopping), and how my fiancé went to the hardware store and bought an identical replacement door, pre painted, for $75 and had it replaced within 10 minutes, nbd. 

if you read this far, i hope my story helps you in some way to strengthen your resolve to never stop fighting, to give yourself permission to make mistakes, and to give yourself credit for even the tiniest things. because every positive and productive thing you do, even just combing your hair or washing up a cup, is one thing your illness didn't stop you doing today. start adding all those little things up, and you'll start to realise you're so much more than a mentally ill person. that doesn't mean it'll ever go away. for most of us this is for life. but it means a happier life where you are in control of your illness. not the other way around.

Feeling hopeless and stuck,"i'm 18, currently jobless and broke. i had a job until the end of last month, where i was a caretaker for developmentally disabled kids. then i was hospitalized (for the 4th time) for suicidal idealization. leading up to the hospitalization, i was having a panic attack pretty much every shift i worked and just dreading work due to anxiety in general. 

this anxiety limits every area of my life. i have no friends but god i wish i did. i love to be around people, but then if i go somewhere to meet people (the mall for example, no bars) i'm a wreck. i think everyone is looking at me thinking how ugly i am, how fat i am and how weird i walk. it's like a catch 22 because i long for contact with people but when put near people, i run and hide.

the anxiety has caused me to go through 6 jobs in the past year. only one of them lasted more than 2 months, and two of them didn't even last a whole shift. my social anxiety and self doubt is crippling. i just graduated high school this year, and i was in a vocational/trade school. i'm good at school and i was in a program where i could graduate high school as a licensed practical nurse. i started skipping class because of depression and lack of motivation. when i did go to class, i would frequently go hide and cry in the bathrooms because i felt like my peers didn't like me. i started skipping clinical because i didn't think i was good enough to be a nurse, and thought that i would accidentally seriously hurt someone i was trying to help. even though i had great grades in my class and received nothing but praise from instructors. i cannot believe for myself that i am good.

i even do not drive due to anxiety. i have completed driver's education, in-class and in-car, as well as practicing with my friends when i used to still actually attempt to drive. it terrifies me. being in the car terrifies me but i can push through it, but being the driver of the car is unbearable.

i live at home with my father, who hasn't had a job for 6 years. he doesn't have any form of income, no disability. he is a veteran so the va pays for our housing and we receive food stamps. until i was about 13 he was addicted to pills and alcohol. i deeply resent him for everything he's put me through, as well as all of his negligence. i regret that when i was 15 he bought me my first joint and ever since then i've been smoking daily. when i was 14 and caught with cigarettes, i was not punished, but applauded for my ability to get the cigarettes despite being a minor. i've been smoking a pack a day for 4 years now and i developed asthma. i hate him for not having a job, i hate him for making me a bastard child, for exposing me to addiction, for letting me go without so many things i needed and deserved growing up.

i'm a transgender male who started testosterone when i was 15, i'm pierced and tattooed, and damn i've seen a lot and i have a lot to tell. i know i am very interesting and unique, and i know i am a loving and friendly person. but i can't help feel like i am boring, worthless, unlovable, not worth anyone's time. maybe i am even evil somewhere deep down, and i just don't realize it. 

every day is so sad. i don't want to get out of bed and people don't care about me. i don't have anyone i feel i can reach to and no one reaches out to me. i feel like every second is pain. sometimes weed doesn't even numb it anymore. 

i live in a small apartment in a small town and like i said i don't drive, so if i do get out of the house, most of my day is spent walking my dogs around this lonely town hoping to find someone else also lonely.

i don't have any real goals. nothing really interests me other than music and weed and dogs and streetwear and hairstyles. no career draws me in, and when i try to imagine myself in a life where i am happy, i can't.

i've been in various forms of therapy for 7 years now (dbt included) and i've been on more meds than i can count. wellbutrin, to zoloft and prozac and trazodone, xanax and zyprexa and vistaril, seroquel and abilify. i'm sure there's some i'm not remembering at the moment. i currently take wellbutrin, prozac and trazodone and i go to counseling weekly.

my diagnoses include borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety, ptsd, ocd, substance abuse disorder, gender dysphoria, and insomnia.

 as i mentioned before, i've been hospitalized 4 times, i've been escorted by police to the er for suicidal behavior a few times, and i've been partially hospitalized/day treatment program.

i don't know if i'm venting or looking for advice or someone who can relate but i just wanted to get as many responses as possible and i couldn't stay with all of this brewing in my mind anymore.

How Should I Get on With My Life?,"i'm really tired of continuously getting nowhere even though i do try.  i  had hypersensitivity of the emotions and senses as a kid.  i grew up in an environment that was somewhat unstable and invalidating, but nothing to the extent that a lot of people who are afflicted with bpd experienced; however, i do believe that my emotional hypersensitivity blew it out of proportion and contributed to my issues today.  around the age of 12, i moved a significant distance away from all of my friends and what i knew as how life was supposed to be and moved into a situation that was less than ideal for someone like myself.  being a naive kid, i was somewhat excited to move.  it wasn't long after i had moved away that i figured out that the friends i had, that had said that they were going to remain in contact with me, weren't going to keep their promises.  so i was alone and in a new environment that didn't suit me.  i tried for awhile to build friendships, but that wasn't happening; no relationship got beyond the superficial, and i hate being only superficial, so i broke off the relationship.  it also didn't help that it is my nature to be slow to warm up to someone which resulted in many people to break the relationship off his or herself before even giving me an honest chance.  i slowly became much more introverted than i already was, and more or less stopped bothering to even attempt to make relationships.

my mood since the move has been gradually declining, becoming so low in the recent years that i have actually gone on to attempt multiple times to fulfill all the suicidal thoughts i've had over the years.  the fact that i've failed multiple times at that is so depressing and has made my mood decline at an accelerated rate ever since.  a few stays in the hospital led to a few referrals and whatnot.  i've been through several psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers.  those that can actually diagnose (i.e. not social workers) have come to different diagnoses:

* major depressive disorder
* major depressive disorder with psychotic traits/qualities/symptoms
* bipolar depressive disorder
* borderline personality disorder

seeking to get better, i've tried several therapies:

* traditional psychotherapy
* cognitive behavioral therapy
* dialectical behavioral therapy

and an even larger number of drugs for at least an appreciable amount of time and at various dosages and in various combinations to see if they even worked:

* zoloft
* prozac
* cymbalta
* seroquel
* mirtazapine
* abilify
* latuda
* lithium carbonate
* depakote
* l-methylfolate
* adderall
* nuvigil
* (i'm sure there are more, but it doesn't matter really.)

none of it worked as expected.  most of the drugs did nothing at all for me except make me gain obscene amounts of weight and have nasty side effects, adderall and nuvigil being the exception, but they still didn't do what we had hoped.  but now i can't even get adderall or nuvigil because of the combination of shitty laws, shitty doctors, and shitty insurance.  neither cbt nor dbt did anything for me, presumable because i was already employing the techniques that they taught.  traditional psychotherapy helped minimally, but i no longer have access to the therapist that actually helped and have yet to find a therapist that can pull off what the therapist that helped did, especially with the limitations that my insurance places on such services.

for the past 2 years or so i've been having very extreme difficulties in sleep, going from periods of hypersomnia (18+ hours a day) to periods of insomnia (&lt;3 hours a day) lasting for 2 weeks to 3 months and back.  it also appears that my sleep fits into what is known as non-24 hour disorder, but my doctor won't even look into it.  the sleep alone makes it extremely difficult to go back to school and finish my last year for my bachelor's.  i've even looked into the school's disability office to see what can be done and they've told me that they can't do anything for me since it would negatively impact the rest of the class and that they can't even do anything regarding attendance.  i had originally dropped out due to the depression and suicidality issues.  i moved back home after dropping out with the intent of going back once i got everything under control.  then my father died about 9 months ago, so now there's a need for me to take care of my younger brother which, for the sake of remaining somewhat anonymous, is between the ages of 5 and 10.  the death of my father has very noticeably taken its toll on my brother and i believe that leaving the house to get on with my life would negatively affect my brother, which negatively affects me.  also, a few years before my father died, he told me that the reason he and my mother seemed so disinterested with me when i was growing up was that i was too intelligent for them to keep up with me.  this has also really negatively affected me, even though it was something that was hinted at all throughout my childhood.

all of the above is just a brief overview of my situation and what affects me.  i've tried continuously to get going again and work toward things that i want, but all the failures have really discouraged me and the anhedonia from the depression has really left me not wanting a lot of things in life.  the few things that i do want (just one good friend [and not even a sexual partner] is at the top of that short list), various people have told me that my expectations or requirements of someone that would satisfy the role are unrealistic which is utterly depressing.  how should i get on with life?  if you would like or require more details, please ask.  i am happy to give details, so long as they cannot, alone or in tandem with what was already said, be used to identify who i or any one of my family members is.",1400776984,False,BPD,2014-05-22 16:43:04,"How Should I Get on With My Life? i'm really tired of continuously getting nowhere even though i do try.  i  had hypersensitivity of the emotions and senses as a kid.  i grew up in an environment that was somewhat unstable and invalidating, but nothing to the extent that a lot of people who are afflicted with bpd experienced; however, i do believe that my emotional hypersensitivity blew it out of proportion and contributed to my issues today.  around the age of 12, i moved a significant distance away from all of my friends and what i knew as how life was supposed to be and moved into a situation that was less than ideal for someone like myself.  being a naive kid, i was somewhat excited to move.  it wasn't long after i had moved away that i figured out that the friends i had, that had said that they were going to remain in contact with me, weren't going to keep their promises.  so i was alone and in a new environment that didn't suit me.  i tried for awhile to build friendships, but that wasn't happening; no relationship got beyond the superficial, and i hate being only superficial, so i broke off the relationship.  it also didn't help that it is my nature to be slow to warm up to someone which resulted in many people to break the relationship off his or herself before even giving me an honest chance.  i slowly became much more introverted than i already was, and more or less stopped bothering to even attempt to make relationships.

my mood since the move has been gradually declining, becoming so low in the recent years that i have actually gone on to attempt multiple times to fulfill all the suicidal thoughts i've had over the years.  the fact that i've failed multiple times at that is so depressing and has made my mood decline at an accelerated rate ever since.  a few stays in the hospital led to a few referrals and whatnot.  i've been through several psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers.  those that can actually diagnose (i.e. not social workers) have come to different diagnoses:

* major depressive disorder
* major depressive disorder with psychotic traits/qualities/symptoms
* bipolar depressive disorder
* borderline personality disorder

seeking to get better, i've tried several therapies:

* traditional psychotherapy
* cognitive behavioral therapy
* dialectical behavioral therapy

and an even larger number of drugs for at least an appreciable amount of time and at various dosages and in various combinations to see if they even worked:

* zoloft
* prozac
* cymbalta
* seroquel
* mirtazapine
* abilify
* latuda
* lithium carbonate
* depakote
* l-methylfolate
* adderall
* nuvigil
* (i'm sure there are more, but it doesn't matter really.)

none of it worked as expected.  most of the drugs did nothing at all for me except make me gain obscene amounts of weight and have nasty side effects, adderall and nuvigil being the exception, but they still didn't do what we had hoped.  but now i can't even get adderall or nuvigil because of the combination of shitty laws, shitty doctors, and shitty insurance.  neither cbt nor dbt did anything for me, presumable because i was already employing the techniques that they taught.  traditional psychotherapy helped minimally, but i no longer have access to the therapist that actually helped and have yet to find a therapist that can pull off what the therapist that helped did, especially with the limitations that my insurance places on such services.
currently, i take no drugs, beyond what samples of nuvigil i can convince my sleep doctor to give me, and i do not receive therapy of any kind.  let me just say that i honestly cannot tell a difference between me with the drugs and therapy and me without the drugs and therapy, nor has anyone in my family said anything to the effect that they can discern a difference.  so i've given up on treating this (or perhaps these) issue(s)--i just want to either do something enjoyable, interesting, and meaningful with my life relatively soon (hell, i'd even settle for any semblance that that's what i'm moving toward) or end it.

Latuda for BPD,"hi all - just wanted to make a quick post about a recent medication change i’ve gone through. i’ve been on and off seroquel a few times now. it’s very effective at controlling my mood swings, but i strongly dislike the (very apparent) weight gain i go through every time i get put back on it. i was convinced to retry seroquel earlier this year because the psychiatrist i saw at the hospital told me that all antipsychotics cause weight gain, so i might as well be on one that works. 

fast forward to a few weeks ago, and i’m meeting with my new psychiatrist who will be following me consistently over the next while. she recommended latuda to me, citing that it was a newer medication primarily used for bipolar, but that she’s seen great success in her bpd patients using it. so far, i’m feeling really stable on it! 

i’ve been on latuda for a little over four weeks (i’ll post an update if my thoughts about it change). the transition from a relatively high dose of seroquel to latuda was fairly seamless. i’m usually fairly reactive to med changes, and this was one of the easier ones i’ve had. you need to take latuda with 350 calories to ensure maximum absorption, so it helps me to eat a nutritious breakfast every morning. latuda can also act as an antidepressant, and this is the biggest difference i saw. i’m still depressed, but i’m finding it easier to get out of bed and go outside. i’m not overeating everyday so there isn’t any guilt around that. i feel more like me than i have in years. 

the only real downside i have to latuda so far is the price. i have fairly good drug coverage, and i’m in canada, so one month currently costs me around $30 (i think it would be over $150/month without coverage). i’m very grateful for the insurance provided to me by my workplace for helping me to afford this medication. for the first time in literally years, i feel hopeful for the future.

Can meds help with dissociation and derealisation?,"i've got a question for y'all, is there any medication that has helped with your dissociation and/or derealisation??

"Relationship over due to BPD, have no faith in a future","**tl;dr**: 1½ year relationship riddled with my mental health issues, boyfriend constantly on his toes and afraid of my volatility and suicidal tendencies. one last meltdown leads to boyfriend dumping me to preserve his own sanity and mental health. feel like a worthless burden with no hope to stabilize or find happiness.

i started dating m in december 2013. we had known each other and been friends for a year prior to the start of our relationship. we were madly in love and the honeymoon phase was great. when i started telling the girls i shared my flat with that i would likely move in with him by summer 2014, one of them jumped the gun in march and bought her own condo. the logical step was to move in with my boyfriend, despite having dated only briefly at this point.

we cohabited peacefully for several months, until i had a mental breakdown due to being stressed out by work. i went on sick leave, and during that time and inbetween seeing doctors, psychologists and a psychiatrist, i decided that i couldn't handle returning to my old job, where there was no chance of adjusting my tasks to better the situation (postal sorting facility, repetitive manual labour, rapid work pace). i opted in for the company's voluntary severance package and handed in my two week's notice. i made the choice in the honest belief that being rid of my job would help me overcome my stress and anxiety issues.

i was wrong. as the summer progressed, i started exhibiting random bouts of irrational, completely unstable and unreasonable behaviour. for example, m and i were supposed to go to ikea to pick up some things for our house. en route i ask him if he has his insulin with him, so we can eat at the ikea restaurant (something i had been anticipating). he informs me that no, he does not. i have a complete meltdown over this news, practically start flailing my hands, and tell him that we can't go now. i turn around and head back home. he is confused and doesn't understand what just happened.

these bouts of insanity keep happening at completely unpredictable intervals, instigated by a variety of things. usually the trigger was some kind of disappointment or anxiety over something, like attending some kind of event, even over going to the movies with some friends.

then the episodes got worse. i started to depersonalize and acted out of character, lashing out with the worst i could deal out, being horrible and insulting, aiming to wound m. i would threaten to hurt myself, tell him he probably didn't want to be with me anyway, and trying to give him back my home key in order to stalk off into the night (with no plan whatsoever, since everything i did during episodes was purely on impulse). we ended up going to a psych emergency unit where the notion of bpd first came up. i was given some antipsychotic pills (risperidone) and sent back home.

when we left the unit, i wanted to throw the pills they gave me away. my episode was not over, and we stood outside the hospital for hours, with me going on about how i didn't deserve m and how it would be better for me to just go away and move out. eventually i snapped out of it, and i tearily hugged him and told him i love him and that i'm afraid of losing him. we reconcile and go home.

i had an appointment reserved with my local health clinic doctor to talk about my mental issues and how to treat them. she prescribed me an antidepressant i had used before, escitalopram (cipralex). she also contacted the local psychiatric outpatient clinic to enroll me as a patient. i started with an evaluation with a psychiatrist and a psychiatric nurse where we talked about the issues i was facing. i saw the nurse about once in two weeks, and m would come along because i asked him to. through this all, he was constantly encouraging me to seek and receive all and any help i could get. my mood didn't improve on cipralex, and during the early autumn it started to deteriorate. my psychiatrist raised the dose of my medication.

i had days when i would do nothing but bawl inconsolably, the crying could be set off by anything at all. i was emotionally raw. most days it was all i could do to crawl out of bed and drag my blanket along with me, build a nest on the couch and nod off there. i felt like my life had no purpose or aim, and felt completely useless. 

my bouts continued sporadically, and in my hopelessness, i would threaten suicide. we ended up at the psych emergency unit several more times. m had to call emergency services to ask them what he should do with a suicidal person, and they told him that if i didn't go to the psych unit willingly, he should call the police to escort me there. i went willingly because i didn't want to cause that much commotion.

meanwhile, i had lost all interest in any sexual activities due to a combination of my medication and my depression. our sex life died completely. we did not have sex anymore, and he did not instigate, as he was sensitive to my lack of libido. however, he also stopped being otherwise affectionate towards me, and i would have to beg him when i wanted to be held or hugged. it made me feel inadequate and unwanted, all the while acutely aware that it was all my fault.

the episodes came and went all through autumn and winter. i started school in january 2015, thinking it would help rehabilitate me and give me a purpose again. i managed school for two and a half months until i had a bad breakdown. i wasn't able to get up to go to school anymore, and m was having none of it. he accused me of being lazy, while for me, the cause was that the thought of school had started causing anxiety. he told me i needed to get a grip, so i got out of bed, got dressed, and left the house in an impulsive hurry. in my agitated, impulsive state, i had decided i would kill myself. i headed for the underground station near our home, planning to throw myself under an oncoming train. as i got to the station, i messaged m, saying goodbye. he tried to call me, but i rejected his call. i went down the escalator to the loading platform, and stood near the mouth of the tunnel, contemplating my jump. in the end, a train came, and i lost my nerve. i couldn't do it. i took the escalator back up, and bought myself a coffee. i went to sit at a nearby square. 

m called me again, this time i answered. he informed me that he had called emergency services, and that they would be calling my number very soon, and asked that i pick up the call. we hung up, and i received the promised call. the woman on the line asked me where i was, and whether i was ok. she then asked me if i wanted her to send an ambulance to come and get me, which i declined. she then told me that i should seek help from an er. i told her i would go back home, and that i would go to an er later that day. when i got back home, m got in touch with my parents. together they agreed they would take me to the er in the evening.

we ended up waiting in the er for about three hours, since they were understaffed and overworked. the psych nurse and doctor we saw suggested that instead of them deciding what to do with me, i should see my own psychiatrist and psych nurse at the psychiatric outpatient clinic the next day with an emergency appointment.

the next day, my dad took me to the appointment, and it was decided by my doctor that seeing as i was acutely suicidal, she would have me voluntarily commit myself to a psych ward. once she made the calls and figured out where i would go, my dad drove me to the hospital and left me in their care. i had high hopes for receiving intensive treatment in the psych ward, but all they did was administer medication, make you follow a schedule, otherwise it was just killing time while being locked up. i had an appointment with a nurse once, and all they did was tell me to take responsibility and ownership of my own life. this was in response to the fact that i told them i was primarily seeking treatment because it was what my boyfriend and parents wanted me to do.

i had thought i would be in the ward for a long time, and had mentally come to terms with that. however, after under a week there, i was told by the ward doctor that i would be discharged the following day. i told her that if i wasn't going to be allowed to stay longer than that, i wished to be discharged immediately. eventually she acquiesced, and i went home.

spring went its merry way, and m told me that he would give the relationship until the end of the year and re-evaluate if there had been any improvement in my state at that point. i was on sick leave from school, and had been since my voluntary commitment. i looked into local support groups for mental health patients, and found a summer workshop aimed at young adults recovering from mental illness. i inquired about it, went in for an interview and was admitted to the summer workshop that would run from june to the end of august. i was trying my best to make an effort.

i was still suicidal. i thought about killing myself almost daily, and had urges to jump off our sixth story balcony. my medication had been adjusted at the psych ward, and changed to venlafaxine (effexor). my psychiatrist raised my dose once, then once more after i told the psych nurse that i had a plan to kill myself. this was at the beginning of june 2015, when i was due to start the summer workshop. june progressed, and my mood started to improve. my suicidal thoughts lifted, and for the first time in what seemed like forever, i felt tentatively hopeful. sadly, this was the beginning of the end.

at the end of june, i decided to go on a diet. this was due to the fact that i had become complacent and shunned all physical activity for the past year, and as a consequence i had gained a very significant amount of weight. i told m i would be starting a diet the next day, and he went into a tirade about how i had attempted diets a handful of times during our relationship, and had never been able to stick to them. he told me that a diet that you can't start right at the same instant isn't really a diet at all. i was pretty pissed off at him at this point, but i decided i would not be goaded into a fight, so i went into the bedroom to get some space. he proceeded to follow me there, so i plugged my ears with my fingers so i would hear what he was saying. he was ranting by himself, so i said out loud that i was not capable of hearing him. he tore the blanket off me and continued to vent at me about how some diet was not what i needed in order to lose weight, and that i should just get off my ass and exercise. he continued his tirade for a while, and then left the room. 

i was left fuming mad. i got up, got dressed and burst out of the room, completely livid, intent on getting out of the apartment so i could be away from his hateful self. he intercepted me at the door, and told me he couldn't let me leave the house in my current state. i tried for the door, but he grabbed me, so i dug my nails into his arm. he didn't flinch, but i stopped, not wanting to hurt him more. eventually he had to wrest my arm behind my back to prevent me from moving, and had me pinned to the ground while twisting my arm. he called my mother, and explained that i had just had another episode. i burst out crying and screamed at the phone that it was all his fault this time, that he had provoked me and belittled me. my mom tried to calm me down, and eventually the situation was defused. i slept on the couch that night, not wanting to be near m.

the next day, we didn't talk about what had happened. i waited all day for m to come home from work, but there was nothing but silence. he went to sleep, and i slept on the couch again. the following day he wasn't home when i got in from the workshop. when he eventually came back home, he was still not talking to me. i stalked out of the apartment, not able to bear the oppressive silence any longer. my mother had been in touch with me the past few days, asking me if we had talked it out. i told her that i couldn't stand the silence anymore, and asked her if she could come and fetch me to sleep at their place instead of at home. she opted to call m instead, and he told me to come back inside so we could talk.

he told me that he had not spoken because he wanted me to be able to be the one to initiate the conversation. in the beginning of june, i had made an appointment to see my psychiatrist about my medication once again in august, to determine whether the higher dose was, in fact, working, or if we needed to overhaul my medication again. m said that the appointment would be the determining factor for whether there was any improvement in my state. the conversation left me feeling like the relationship was all but over already.

it took a few more days, but i told him that we needed to talk. i told him that i did not want to be held in anticipation, not knowing whether the relationship would continue past my appointment in august. i told him to just give it to me straight: did he or did he not want to be with me anymore? he told me then that he just couldn't take it anymore. he could face not being able to predict when i would blow up again, if i would actually succeed one time and truly kill myself, and he would be faced with nightmares for the rest of his life. it was his sanity or continuing a toxic relationship with me.

i was absolutely devastated. i cried for hours after we had talked, and cried myself to sleep on the couch. i stopped attending my summer workshop. the next day, i waited all day for m to come home from work, and told him i needed to discuss the break-up with him. i ended up crying hysterically again. the next day when m came from work, i couldn't bear to be around him anymore, trying to act all normal, like nothing was the matter and that i could just continue living my everyday life normally as though nothing had happened. i called my father and told him he needed to come get me and my things.

that was july 7th. the following day i went back to our place just to talk with m, and ended up having a tearful meltdown again. i had my car, so i took my pc with me that time. the next few days were bleak and sad. on saturday the 11th, i decided to kill myself. i went to the liquour store, bought 1,5l (50.7 fl oz) of 32% (64 proof) spirits (which, in hindsight, was not nearly strong enough), and downed one liter (33.8 fl oz) of the spirits. then i called my ex, calmly telling him that i intended to die. he informed me that it was unlikely that would be the case. we continued to talk while i became inebriated. something he said pissed me off, so i hung up, and started to bombard him with whatsapp messages instead. at some point my sister came home and found me drunk out of my mind. she panicked, debated calling emergency services, but called my brother instead. he then called my parents, who were spending the weekend at the summer house of their friends, a few hours away, and they left immediately, headed back. i threw up a lot, wanted to lie down, and my siblings tried to keep me from passing out. meanwhile i keep going on and on about how miserable i am without my cat, who is still staying with the ex due to the fact that she hates and can't get along with my parents' cats. my drunk self thinks it's a brilliant idea to go fetch the cat that instant, and that supposedly it would provide some sort of comfort. for some unfathomable reason my brother seems to think my idea is good, so we drive to the ex's place. when we get there, i have a drunken change of heart and exclaim that it is for the best of the cat if we just leave her there. my frustrated brother drives us back to my parents' place. my parents arrive, and they whisk me away to the hospital. the first one won't treat me since i'm not a resident of that city, so we need to go to the hospital at the city i reside in. 

by this time i have sobered up considerably. when we see a psych nurse, he has me breathalyzed - 0,92 mg/l. he tells us that he can't administer medication to a drunk patient, and that there is not really anything he feels that should be done in the situation. he recommends we just go home and wait for my next appointment with my own psych nurse, which is three days hence. he ends up consulting a doctor who allows him to give us quetiapine (seroquel) to take home, on the condition that my mother holds onto it and administers it to me. we go back home.

in retrospect i realise how pathetic and miscalculated my attempt was. i would have needed a stronger proof of liquour and more of it in order to reach a lethal level of intoxication. kids, remember to do your math.

i saw my ex once last week when i went to pick up some of my things from our place. the rest of the time i've tried not to contact him, but have ended up doing so regardless. all those times have ended up in tearful accusations and bitterness, and me a sobbing heap. i have come to realise that i will not be able to keep in touch with my ex in any way after i have removed my belongings from our joint home.

i have spent the past week looking for a new home for me and my cat, and today i received a call from one of the places where i left an application - the couple renting the apartment had chosen me as their new tenant, and i will be able to move in on the first of august. having my own place and getting my things and my cat from the old place will finalize the break-up, and i can cease all communication and contact with my ex. 

i can't be civil with him, i can't even talk to him without a resounding sadness at being abandoned, losing both my spouse and my best friend, and what hopes and dreams i had for a future together. in a fucked up situation that was hard on everyone involved, i was trying my best and doing everything he asked me to do to get better. it just wasn't enough. i wasn't good enough, and in the end i was just dragging him down with me, making his life miserable. it makes me feel utterly worthless and despicable to have caused someone so much pain to one i loved so much.

i have lost all hope of ever having a happy future, or achieving or having any of the things i have hoped i would one day have. i harbour no hope of recovering from my depression, or of getting my bpd under control. i hate myself and i wish i could just die.

i don't even know if this is the appropriate subreddit for this, but i don't have anyone i can talk to anymore.",1437347119,False,BPD,2015-07-19 23:05:19,"Relationship over due to BPD, have no faith in a future **tl;dr**: 1½ year relationship riddled with my mental health issues, boyfriend constantly on his toes and afraid of my volatility and suicidal tendencies. one last meltdown leads to boyfriend dumping me to preserve his own sanity and mental health. feel like a worthless burden with no hope to stabilize or find happiness.

i started dating m in december 2013. we had known each other and been friends for a year prior to the start of our relationship. we were madly in love and the honeymoon phase was great. when i started telling the girls i shared my flat with that i would likely move in with him by summer 2014, one of them jumped the gun in march and bought her own condo. the logical step was to move in with my boyfriend, despite having dated only briefly at this point.

we cohabited peacefully for several months, until i had a mental breakdown due to being stressed out by work. i went on sick leave, and during that time and inbetween seeing doctors, psychologists and a psychiatrist, i decided that i couldn't handle returning to my old job, where there was no chance of adjusting my tasks to better the situation (postal sorting facility, repetitive manual labour, rapid work pace). i opted in for the company's voluntary severance package and handed in my two week's notice. i made the choice in the honest belief that being rid of my job would help me overcome my stress and anxiety issues.

i was wrong. as the summer progressed, i started exhibiting random bouts of irrational, completely unstable and unreasonable behaviour. for example, m and i were supposed to go to ikea to pick up some things for our house. en route i ask him if he has his insulin with him, so we can eat at the ikea restaurant (something i had been anticipating). he informs me that no, he does not. i have a complete meltdown over this news, practically start flailing my hands, and tell him that we can't go now. i turn around and head back home. he is confused and doesn't understand what just happened.

these bouts of insanity keep happening at completely unpredictable intervals, instigated by a variety of things. usually the trigger was some kind of disappointment or anxiety over something, like attending some kind of event, even over going to the movies with some friends.

then the episodes got worse. i started to depersonalize and acted out of character, lashing out with the worst i could deal out, being horrible and insulting, aiming to wound m. i would threaten to hurt myself, tell him he probably didn't want to be with me anyway, and trying to give him back my home key in order to stalk off into the night (with no plan whatsoever, since everything i did during episodes was purely on impulse). we ended up going to a psych emergency unit where the notion of bpd first came up. i was given some antipsychotic pills (risperidone) and sent back home.

when we left the unit, i wanted to throw the pills they gave me away. my episode was not over, and we stood outside the hospital for hours, with me going on about how i didn't deserve m and how it would be better for me to just go away and move out. eventually i snapped out of it, and i tearily hugged him and told him i love him and that i'm afraid of losing him. we reconcile and go home.

i had an appointment reserved with my local health clinic doctor to talk about my mental issues and how to treat them. she prescribed me an antidepressant i had used before, escitalopram (cipralex). she also contacted the local psychiatric outpatient clinic to enroll me as a patient. i started with an evaluation with a psychiatrist and a psychiatric nurse where we talked about the issues i was facing. i saw the nurse about once in two weeks, and m would come along because i asked him to. through this all, he was constantly encouraging me to seek and receive all and any help i could get. my mood didn't improve on cipralex, and during the early autumn it started to deteriorate. my psychiatrist raised the dose of my medication.

i had days when i would do nothing but bawl inconsolably, the crying could be set off by anything at all. i was emotionally raw. most days it was all i could do to crawl out of bed and drag my blanket along with me, build a nest on the couch and nod off there. i felt like my life had no purpose or aim, and felt completely useless. 

my bouts continued sporadically, and in my hopelessness, i would threaten suicide. we ended up at the psych emergency unit several more times. m had to call emergency services to ask them what he should do with a suicidal person, and they told him that if i didn't go to the psych unit willingly, he should call the police to escort me there. i went willingly because i didn't want to cause that much commotion.

meanwhile, i had lost all interest in any sexual activities due to a combination of my medication and my depression. our sex life died completely. we did not have sex anymore, and he did not instigate, as he was sensitive to my lack of libido. however, he also stopped being otherwise affectionate towards me, and i would have to beg him when i wanted to be held or hugged. it made me feel inadequate and unwanted, all the while acutely aware that it was all my fault.

the episodes came and went all through autumn and winter. i started school in january 2015, thinking it would help rehabilitate me and give me a purpose again. i managed school for two and a half months until i had a bad breakdown. i wasn't able to get up to go to school anymore, and m was having none of it. he accused me of being lazy, while for me, the cause was that the thought of school had started causing anxiety. he told me i needed to get a grip, so i got out of bed, got dressed, and left the house in an impulsive hurry. in my agitated, impulsive state, i had decided i would kill myself. i headed for the underground station near our home, planning to throw myself under an oncoming train. as i got to the station, i messaged m, saying goodbye. he tried to call me, but i rejected his call. i went down the escalator to the loading platform, and stood near the mouth of the tunnel, contemplating my jump. in the end, a train came, and i lost my nerve. i couldn't do it. i took the escalator back up, and bought myself a coffee. i went to sit at a nearby square. 

m called me again, this time i answered. he informed me that he had called emergency services, and that they would be calling my number very soon, and asked that i pick up the call. we hung up, and i received the promised call. the woman on the line asked me where i was, and whether i was ok. she then asked me if i wanted her to send an ambulance to come and get me, which i declined. she then told me that i should seek help from an er. i told her i would go back home, and that i would go to an er later that day. when i got back home, m got in touch with my parents. together they agreed they would take me to the er in the evening.

we ended up waiting in the er for about three hours, since they were understaffed and overworked. the psych nurse and doctor we saw suggested that instead of them deciding what to do with me, i should see my own psychiatrist and psych nurse at the psychiatric outpatient clinic the next day with an emergency appointment.

the next day, my dad took me to the appointment, and it was decided by my doctor that seeing as i was acutely suicidal, she would have me voluntarily commit myself to a psych ward. once she made the calls and figured out where i would go, my dad drove me to the hospital and left me in their care. i had high hopes for receiving intensive treatment in the psych ward, but all they did was administer medication, make you follow a schedule, otherwise it was just killing time while being locked up. i had an appointment with a nurse once, and all they did was tell me to take responsibility and ownership of my own life. this was in response to the fact that i told them i was primarily seeking treatment because it was what my boyfriend and parents wanted me to do.

i had thought i would be in the ward for a long time, and had mentally come to terms with that. however, after under a week there, i was told by the ward doctor that i would be discharged the following day. i told her that if i wasn't going to be allowed to stay longer than that, i wished to be discharged immediately. eventually she acquiesced, and i went home.

spring went its merry way, and m told me that he would give the relationship until the end of the year and re-evaluate if there had been any improvement in my state at that point. i was on sick leave from school, and had been since my voluntary commitment. i looked into local support groups for mental health patients, and found a summer workshop aimed at young adults recovering from mental illness. i inquired about it, went in for an interview and was admitted to the summer workshop that would run from june to the end of august. i was trying my best to make an effort.

i was still suicidal. i thought about killing myself almost daily, and had urges to jump off our sixth story balcony. my medication had been adjusted at the psych ward, and changed to venlafaxine (effexor). my psychiatrist raised my dose once, then once more after i told the psych nurse that i had a plan to kill myself. this was at the beginning of june 2015, when i was due to start the summer workshop. june progressed, and my mood started to improve. my suicidal thoughts lifted, and for the first time in what seemed like forever, i felt tentatively hopeful. sadly, this was the beginning of the end.

med advice/experience,"hello! i am looking to see if anyone has had similar experiences as me, and/or if anyone has any advice/warnings for my medicine change!!


this will be long, i'm sorry 


earlier this year, i was admitted to a mental hospital and diagnosed with bpd. i was put on seroquel, 50mgs, immediate release. i liked the slight stabilization and reduction in episodes but i didn't feel like the 50mgs was doing just too much, so a few months later i talked to my psychiatrist to get it adjusted. she prescribed me an additional dose of extended release seroquel at 50mgs as well. so i was taking 100mgs, half extended, half immediate.


getting the dose upped amplified all of my negative side effects, such as dissociation, irritability, loss of sense of self, and especially weight gain. i went from 141lbs to 161 in two weeks. it just made me feel so. out of my body. worse, and in a different way, than usual. i quit taking the extended release, then saw the doctor to talk about not taking seroquel anymore. 

now i am on lamictal, or lamotrigine, and taking bigger doses each week. i took 25mg the first week, 50mg this week, etc, until i get to 100mg. at 75mg, i am to stop taking my seroquel, and instead start taking 25mg of trazodone, for my lucid dreaming/inability to fully sleep. i've done some research and saw it's qualified as an antidepressant and sedative. i've also read that it can react weird with pill form birth control, which i take (chateal)

do any of you have any advice, or any experiences with these medications? especially if anyone else is on lamictal and trazodone. what should i expect? did anyone else have a negative experience with seroquel? thanks to everyone who comments, in advance. i really appreciate it.",1527806810,False,BPD,2018-05-31 22:46:50,"med advice/experience hello! i am looking to see if anyone has had similar experiences as me, and/or if anyone has any advice/warnings for my medicine change!!

Any joy with Aripiprazole/Mirtazapine combination? Or Quetiapine/Mirtazapine combination?,"i've just had a conversation with my psychiatrist who has offered me a combination of mirtazapine and aripiprazole.. or mirtazapine and quetiapine? 

he also offered the choice of going back on fluoxetine alongside aripiprazole or quatiapine due to the fact that i've had a little bit of success with fluoxetine on it's own before, yet the benefits seemed to wear off too quickly so i stopped taking it. 

he originally wanted me to take olanzapine alongside vortioxetine or fluoxetine. but the problem is i  suffer with cluster headaches :( and as an abortative medication i have sumatriptan injections that work very well when used if /when i suffer cluster attacks.. yet, i can't use them alongside ssri's due to the fact that they have a high risk of serotonin syndrome. 

i refused to take the olanzapine due to the side effect profile

i also should mention i just stopped taking vortioxetine around 8 days ago after 4 months of use due to lack of efficiancy at 10 mg doses and 20 mg doses.

Please someone tell me it gets better...,"i was diagnosed with bpd back in 2016 but didn’t really think i had it. my ex was diagnosed with it later that year or maybe the following year and i watched her go through hell so i figured “there’s no way i have that, i’m nothing like her”. wellll after we broke up i learned a lot about it and what do you know, i fucking have it. anyway, i’ve always been on an antidepressant and then got put on latuda back in 2018 when i fell into a depression after an old classmate from high school ended his life. i was depressed for probably 6 months and then was stable for about 2.5 years. back in may i started using nicotine and then became addicted for a couple months until i was laying in bed and had this out of body panic attack and i freaked out and blamed it on the nicotine so i quit cold turkey (bad idea). at this time i was drinking and smoking a little weed but not a lot of both. then i just spiraled into this deep dark depression/existential crisis. it’s almost been 3 months and at this rate i feel like it’s getting worse. my psychiatrist put me on lamictal but i know it takes weeks to kick in which sucks. she took me off of latuda and put me on 100mg of seroquel but i feel like it’s making me have crazy anxiety so we’re going back to latuda. seroquel doesn’t even knock me out like wtf. so right now i’m taking 20mg of paxil (that i don’t even think works anymore), 25 of lamictal (until we find a higher dose that works), and 20 of latuda. i have an appointment with a therapist on tuesday who knows dbt and i know i need to start that. 

what brings me on here is i went to admit myself today to a psychiatric hospital and they wouldn’t take me!! that’s so fucked up. i told the doctor i wanted to kill myself and had access to do so and he gave me outpatient resources that i can’t even go to until monday and told me to follow up with my doctor. the us’s medical system is a joke. they don’t care. 

do any of you ever fall into random deep depressions like this that are usually triggered by something? can medicine help that? i’ve been stable pretty much my whole life for the most part and have always been able to bounce back from negative emotions. this is probably only the 2nd time i’ve ever been depressed but this is the worst it’s ever been. 

someone send words of encouragement please. i don’t want to live like this forever. all my brain keeps thinking about is dying and it’s so fucking scary. i mean i’ve always thought about it my whole life but it’s mostly just been passing thoughts. i feel like the thoughts are so loud right now.",1610240496,False,BPD,2021-01-10 01:01:36,"Please someone tell me it gets better... i was diagnosed with bpd back in 2016 but didn’t really think i had it. my ex was diagnosed with it later that year or maybe the following year and i watched her go through hell so i figured “there’s no way i have that, i’m nothing like her”. wellll after we broke up i learned a lot about it and what do you know, i fucking have it. anyway, i’ve always been on an antidepressant and then got put on latuda back in 2018 when i fell into a depression after an old classmate from high school ended his life. i was depressed for probably 6 months and then was stable for about 2.5 years. back in may i started using nicotine and then became addicted for a couple months until i was laying in bed and had this out of body panic attack and i freaked out and blamed it on the nicotine so i quit cold turkey (bad idea). at this time i was drinking and smoking a little weed but not a lot of both. then i just spiraled into this deep dark depression/existential crisis. it’s almost been 3 months and at this rate i feel like it’s getting worse. my psychiatrist put me on lamictal but i know it takes weeks to kick in which sucks. she took me off of latuda and put me on 100mg of seroquel but i feel like it’s making me have crazy anxiety so we’re going back to latuda. seroquel doesn’t even knock me out like wtf. so right now i’m taking 20mg of paxil (that i don’t even think works anymore), 25 of lamictal (until we find a higher dose that works), and 20 of latuda. i have an appointment with a therapist on tuesday who knows dbt and i know i need to start that.

Nothing to look forward to and lacking a will to live.,"i am 20m, in uk, diagnosed with asd, ocd, and 'eupd traits'. i couldn't get a full review for bpd/eupd, because it wouldn't affect my treatment options. the former two were diagnosed in 2016 which is the same year i was prescribed an antidepressant. i have been on different medications for over 4 years.

initially, in mid-2016, i had fluoxetine. after some months, this was changed to sertraline, and an antipsychotic (risperidone) was added. i stayed on this medication for some years. in mid/late 2019, risperidone was replaced with quetiapine. in early-2020, sertraline was replaced with venlafaxine. as of now, it's impossible for me to confirm if the medication has made, or is making, a positive difference.

since 2016, i have had numerous forms of treatment: talking to psychiatrists, counselling with trained professionals, psychotherapy, cbt therapy (i did this in late-2018/early-2019, but i am currently in a second round of it, with longer sessions), calling helplines, etc.

i have had numerous blood tests, checking vitamin/mineral levels, testosterone, thyroxine, tsh, etc. this shows low thyroxine (free t4) and high tsh. this indicates hypothyroidism, but i need to wait for another blood test in february to confirm the pattern. quetiapine could be causing this thyroid issue which explains my frequent sleeping. interests flick on and off like switches in my brain, and my mood/optimism rapidly changes. this is likely eupd-related, and medication might never fix this.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

treatment may have helped me to complete my pre-university education and lead a more-functional lifestyle, but i am far from living a happy life.

i am not currently in-education, but i have applied to university for entry in september/october 2021. ever since the uk lockdown began in march, i have spent some time on my studies (looking over my old work and getting a head start on what is to come) and do research into what i want, career-wise. now, all university admissions commitments (e.g. applications, interviews and tests) are over. 

i'm not looking forward to studying engineering, because i'm terrified of many things, namely boredom and the high workload. i don't know if i'll be alive in september 2021. i feel like university will lead me to a life far away from art, writing, music, or anything of that sort. i cannot see all of these things coming together in any meaningful way. if i miraculously graduate in engineering, how are any of these side projects going to lead me anywhere? i'm being pulled in completely different directions. 

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

since april/may, i started duolingo to study japanese. i only do 15 minutes on my phone, on a near-daily basis. i may start doing more hand-written work and in-depth studying (from my downloaded resources), since i don't have university deadlines looming over me.

over the months, i have tried to get into python and drawing. i did some basic programming practice today, using online resources, but it has been months since i did any art. it's not really art, just the homework exercises from the drawabox website. all of this is very boring, and i feel like i can never get better due to my procrastination. 

i want to be good at art, but i'll never make it the way that i'm going now. when it comes to writing stories, reading or music, just forget about it. it's been months since i touched the novel i wanted to read. i know i have to read if i want to be a good writer, but i cannot do it. i haven't played an instrument in years, despite having access to a keyboard and acoustic guitar. i just can't see a point in starting. it's not fun, and it will take years upon years to feel like i'm getting somewhere. i rarely play games, because i don't feel in the mood to play them.

gyms re-opened in late-july, but i didn't decide to come back until late-september. i did weight training 3 times per week until the second november lockdown forced gyms to close again. when they opened again in december, i went every other day. i managed to work my way back to the same place i was before the november closure. they have been closed for just under a week, due to christmas, but i'll start again tomorrow. 

these setbacks have been really annoying, and i question why i'm even doing this, when i doubt i'll have the time once university starts. i don't want to lose my progress. it's mainly for vanity and maybe some health benefit. i go in the hope that, one day, i'll like the way i look, but this will take many years. it's not fun, and it doesn't always improve how i feel, once i've done a session.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

i watched soul on disney+, and the scene came-up about appreciating life for the little things. all i could think is that it sucks for me and everyone else with anhedonia, who cannot feel pleasure from these little things that make life worth living. i though that the existential premise would be for me, but i felt empty the whole way through, never smiling or feeling moved. there are a few things i have watched this year that i like, but it just makes me long for the day when i will be good-enough to create my own media.

i am so tired of everything feeling like a chore and the constant jealousy. there are times where i cannot look at someone's art/animation online without feeling like it's already over for me. the same applies to music. there are numerous people i have reached-out to, some semi-popular, not online celebrities or anything. some do talk occasionally, but the rest either haven't seen my messages or have read them and not responded. i feel even more worthless, knowing that months have passed and i don't matter to any of these people. i feel inadequate in every way to them. there's no reason for me to exist when they do.

when i procrastinate, i go to bed and rest, hoping that my thoughts will go away. i have nobody in my life. i don't love my father, and i told him right to his face. i don't know how i feel towards my mother and siblings, even though they love me. there are some friends, but i don't think they would be any worse-off if i died. many are busy and live far across the country, due to university. i feel a lack of closeness to anyone, but what's painful is that i desire connection more than anything.

i am tired of spending every night in an empty bed. even if i had a partner, they couldn't take away the mental exhaustion and pain i feel. i'll never be happy with myself. i have no self-esteem, and i feel like worthless most of the time. i have many regrets and hold trauma from the past. discussing this in therapy at great-length has not reduced the inner guilt and shame i feel.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

there are two reasons i am not already dead:

1) i don't want to die a failure. dying, being forgotten and having served no purpose is my greatest fear. even if i say that what i do doesn't matter, because this universe isn't forever, that just creates its own anxiety. if, no matter what i do, the world will cease to be one day, why bother living if i don't enjoy it? why put myself through all of this work and pain when i get nothing out of it? all the praise and accolades in the world can't give me what i want. i want to feel appreciated, but i cannot see myself ever being content. i don't want fame, but i want to be needed.

2) i have done a lot of research into suicide methods. physical means are not an option, so that leaves overdose or poisoning. overdose on legal substances is notoriously unreliable and results in many failed attempts, potentially with life-altering consequences. poisoning will work, but i can't get it. i don't trust paying for sn online. even if what i order is what i get, it could get seized. i'll lose my money and could face punishment for ordering without a chemical license.

since 2016, i have had numerous forms of treatment: talking to psychiatrists, counselling with trained professionals, psychotherapy, cbt therapy (i did this in late-2018/early-2019, but i am currently in a second round of it, with longer sessions), calling helplines, etc.

i have had numerous blood tests, checking vitamin/mineral levels, testosterone, thyroxine, tsh, etc. this shows low thyroxine (free t4) and high tsh. this indicates hypothyroidism, but i need to wait for another blood test in february to confirm the pattern. quetiapine could be causing this thyroid issue which explains my frequent sleeping. interests flick on and off like switches in my brain, and my mood/optimism rapidly changes. this is likely eupd-related, and medication might never fix this.

treatment may have helped me to complete my pre-university education and lead a more-functional lifestyle, but i am far from living a happy life.

i am not currently in-education, but i have applied to university for entry in september/october 2021. ever since the uk lockdown began in march, i have spent some time on my studies (looking over my old work and getting a head start on what is to come) and do research into what i want, career-wise. now, all university admissions commitments (e.g. applications, interviews and tests) are over. 

i'm not looking forward to studying engineering, because i'm terrified of many things, namely boredom and the high workload. i don't know if i'll be alive in september 2021. i feel like university will lead me to a life far away from art, writing, music, or anything of that sort. i cannot see all of these things coming together in any meaningful way. if i miraculously graduate in engineering, how are any of these side projects going to lead me anywhere? i'm being pulled in completely different directions. 

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

since april/may, i started duolingo to study japanese. i only do 15 minutes on my phone, on a near-daily basis. i may start doing more hand-written work and in-depth studying (from my downloaded resources), since i don't have university deadlines looming over me.

over the months, i have tried to get into python and drawing. i did some basic programming practice today, using online resources, but it has been months since i did any art. it's not really art, just the homework exercises from the drawabox website. all of this is very boring, and i feel like i can never get better due to my procrastination. 

i want to be good at art, but i'll never make it the way that i'm going now. when it comes to writing stories, reading or music, just forget about it. it's been months since i touched the novel i wanted to read. i know i have to read if i want to be a good writer, but i cannot do it. i haven't played an instrument in years, despite having access to a keyboard and acoustic guitar. i just can't see a point in starting. it's not fun, and it will take years upon years to feel like i'm getting somewhere. i rarely play games, because i don't feel in the mood to play them.

gyms re-opened in late-july, but i didn't decide to come back until late-september. i did weight training 3 times per week until the second november lockdown forced gyms to close again. when they opened again in december, i went every other day. i managed to work my way back to the same place i was before the november closure. they have been closed for just under a week, due to christmas, but i'll start again tomorrow. 

these setbacks have been really annoying, and i question why i'm even doing this, when i doubt i'll have the time once university starts. i don't want to lose my progress. it's mainly for vanity and maybe some health benefit. i go in the hope that, one day, i'll like the way i look, but this will take many years. it's not fun, and it doesn't always improve how i feel, once i've done a session.

&amp;#x200b;

i watched soul on disney+, and the scene came-up about appreciating life for the little things. all i could think is that it sucks for me and everyone else with anhedonia, who cannot feel pleasure from these little things that make life worth living. i though that the existential premise would be for me, but i felt empty the whole way through, never smiling or feeling moved. there are a few things i have watched this year that i like, but it just makes me long for the day when i will be good-enough to create my own media.

i am so tired of everything feeling like a chore and the constant jealousy. there are times where i cannot look at someone's art/animation online without feeling like it's already over for me. the same applies to music. there are numerous people i have reached-out to, some semi-popular, not online celebrities or anything. some do talk occasionally, but the rest either haven't seen my messages or have read them and not responded. i feel even more worthless, knowing that months have passed and i don't matter to any of these people. i feel inadequate in every way to them. there's no reason for me to exist when they do.

when i procrastinate, i go to bed and rest, hoping that my thoughts will go away. i have nobody in my life. i don't love my father, and i told him right to his face. i don't know how i feel towards my mother and siblings, even though they love me. there are some friends, but i don't think they would be any worse-off if i died. many are busy and live far across the country, due to university. i feel a lack of closeness to anyone, but what's painful is that i desire connection more than anything.

i am tired of spending every night in an empty bed. even if i had a partner, they couldn't take away the mental exhaustion and pain i feel. i'll never be happy with myself. i have no self-esteem, and i feel like worthless most of the time. i have many regrets and hold trauma from the past. discussing this in therapy at great-length has not reduced the inner guilt and shame i feel.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

there are two reasons i am not already dead:

1) i don't want to die a failure. dying, being forgotten and having served no purpose is my greatest fear. even if i say that what i do doesn't matter, because this universe isn't forever, that just creates its own anxiety. if, no matter what i do, the world will cease to be one day, why bother living if i don't enjoy it? why put myself through all of this work and pain when i get nothing out of it? all the praise and accolades in the world can't give me what i want. i want to feel appreciated, but i cannot see myself ever being content. i don't want fame, but i want to be needed.

2) i have done a lot of research into suicide methods. physical means are not an option, so that leaves overdose or poisoning. overdose on legal substances is notoriously unreliable and results in many failed attempts, potentially with life-altering consequences. poisoning will work, but i can't get it. i don't trust paying for sn online. even if what i order is what i get, it could get seized. i'll lose my money and could face punishment for ordering without a chemical license.

How do I stop hating myself for the mood swings? (Also any mood-stabilizing meds experiences would be appreciated),"i am really really happy with my current therapist and have been getting a lot better on the coping skills/insights piece of things, but i feel like i'm making absolutely no progress on the actual intensity of emotion that i'm experiencing and now that i'm a little out of the fog of things it feels like i see even more how stupid i am when i'm experiencing the really intense rapid mood swings, especially when the emotions are over really stupid things.

yesterday all my friends were out partying for cinco de mayo. they didn't invite me because i am pretty much universally known to be a bad drunk and have told most of them that i'm trying to not be around drinking and trying not to drink which basically anyone who has seen me drunk agrees is a good idea. despite knowing all this, i basically went into full on sobbing meltdown because everyone was out without me and didn't invite me and it felt like no one wanted me around, blah blah, spiral of self hatred. at one point i had to pull over and parked on the side of the road for about twenty minutes just straight up sobbing (which is really weird for me actually, in the last three years i'd been so apathetically depressed that i could almost never cry). another twenty minutes later, i hear back from a friend who's not going out and we hang and i'm immediately into happy bouncy self. when i reflected on this at the end of the night i just felt so pathetic, like yeah i guess minor points for me for not self harming or fully blowing up like i might have without the skills i've been building (i sent some kind of dramatic pissy texts but that's it and is pretty subdued for me) but even if i can keep the emotions from exploding out to other people, i can still see them, and i feel like such a fucking loser for having them.

other examples are like rage attacks, etc. even when i can do all the coping stuff, step away from the situation, keep myself from doing anything bad or hurtful, the emotion feels like it's still just as strong or at least almost as strong and the fact that it exists makes me feel so shitty about myself. and i know you ""can't control emotions"" but hate myself so much for having emotions that are so broken and petty and childish and irrational. 

anyway, i'm also wondering if maybe there are any meds anyone has tried that have helped keep moods from swinging so quickly or so intensely. i've tried escitalopram (cipralex/lexapro), buproprion (wellbutrin), quetiapine (seroquel), alprazolam (xanax), venlafaxine (effexor), and vilazodone (viibryd) so far and while some of them have kept me from being so rock bottom depressed that i'm constantly suicidal, nothing has helped at with reducing the intense highs of emotion (including the happier impulsive/hypomanic ones but also rage), and nothing has helped at all with stopping me from so rapidly cycling through moods. i'm hoping maybe they will mellow out over time, maybe as i keep processing trauma they will settle down a bit, but for right now i just really hate myself for being such an unstable piece of shit and i don't know how to make myself not that.

I am scared. Have u tried any of these together??,"so i’ve been kinda depressed this past month, and i've been on lexapro for a while now. (they change it to citalopram for like two months but changed back to lexapro, cuz sad). i've been on carbamazepine for a while too, like, i might guess, 8 months (i don't even know why honestly haha). i got seroquel for insomnia but it makes me gain weight like crazy so i take it from time to time (my psych was okay with that) but right now, i'm supposed to take it every day for 3 weeks. and this past week she prescribed me bupropion (aka wellbutrin). idk. i kinda get scared when starting new meds. i get super obsessive with the idea of how they interact and if i'm gonna get fucked up and die or something. plus i really don't want to gain weight or lose my libido or have a seizure and crack my head open. also, if you have experience with food/alcohol interactions, would be appreciated!!

"Misdiagnosed as bipolar, how long will it take to recover from years of unnecessary anti-psychotics?","i was 17 when they misdiagnosed me as bipolar, and cycled through maybe 20-25 different antidepressants and eventually antipsychotics in the past 6 years. from zoloft to seroquel, i’ve been there. 

i knew from around then that i had every symptom of bpd, but no doctor until maybe 6 years later would professionally diagnose it. i was committed at one point, honestly was on so many antipsychotics i can’t really remember why. anyways, i’m getting off track here. 

i really have a lot of respect for my new psychiatrist. he diagnosed me with bpd after a few sessions, and agreed that therapy, not years and years of antipsychotic medication is what’ll help me. he took me off abilify (which led to me gaining a severe amount of weight in about 4 years, looks like it caused an insulin resistance) very recently, and i feel like i’m going out of my head cycling through moods. i have been going from one extreme to the other, within a span of hours. i am overstimulated, constantly nervous. i can’t sleep as well as i could when i was taking it. i’ve started to lose the weight, which is good, but i’m also coming out of the fog and remembering more and more traumatic stuff, like the hospitalization at a young age. yikes.

What Meds Work For You?,"ayo, 

here to talk about meds. for years (before i was properly diagnosed) i was on relatively high doses of multiple ssris- prozac, wellbutrin, buspirone, and hydroxyzine for all my symptoms. during this time my anxiety and depression were more manageable but i hated the way i felt (like a completely dif person, i have like no feelings at all). after i got diagnosed with bpd, i went off off everything but wellbutrin, (actually got a rare case of serotonin syndrome) and started taking seroquel. i started off at 25mg, and gradually increased my dosage to 150/day. (and 300mg of wellbutrin). i feel like seroquel helps me in some ways, it def helps stabilize my mood a little bit, but it’s not enough. on top of that every time i have even a little bit of alcohol it exasperates my symptoms and i get suicidal, extremely emotional, agitated, and super toxic. i have been drinking a lot less, but idk i feel like it’s just not worth it (i’m in my 20s and want to drink sometimes, ya know?) and it’s not doing enough for me. i’m still crying almost every day, constantly splitting,insane mood fluctuations, panic attacks multiple times a week, s*icidal ideations, etc. i cannot handle it so i’m going to talk to my doc about changing my meds. i’m scared to go off of them tbh, i really don’t wanna deal with any side effects that may come with that but i think that i desperately need to. i’m also going back to therapy and doing dbt again, which i know will help as well. 

my question is: what meds have worked for you? what was/is your dosage? i’m looking for recommendations so i can discuss them with my doctor and try to find out something that works for me. i want to live a good life, i want to be a good friend and gf, i want to be free from the constant exhaustion and roller coaster that is bpd symptoms. i apologize for the long ass post. happy holidays!",1639723305,False,BPD,2021-12-17 06:41:45,"What Meds Work For You? ayo,

Anyone know a med similar to quetiapine but without the weight gain?,"hi! some background info i’m currently on sertraline and i am also prescribed quetiapine (a relatively small dose of 25mg in the morning and 50mg at night) however i stopped taking my quetiapine a few months ago after it made me gain around 30 pounds in 5/6 months. as someone with problems with ed’s and serious body image problems i could not cope with that amount of weight gained and in fear of gaining more i stopped taking them.

apart from the weight gain, it was a great med for me and seemed to be working well despite the small dose. i did also use to take an extra 25mg as prn when having a bpd episode which calmed me down. it was a life saver really in that aspect but unfortunately the weight gain over-rid the good. been off it for about two months now so have got through the awful withdrawal stage.

so now i am just on sertraline and my mood swings and episodes are becoming very frequent again. i’m an emotional wreck and i can’t get anything done. i have no motivation and basically just spend my days in bed falling behind on all my uni work. i hate this.

i have a medication review coming up next week where i’m going to tell them i’ve come of quetiapine but i really feel like i need to be put on an alternative because as i am right now i don’t think an anti depressant is enough and i feel like i definitely need an anti psychotic or mood stabiliser to go along side it. does anyone know of a med similar to quetiapine just without the weight gain? i’m sure my psychiatrist will have some options but would just like to get a perspective and advice from people with bpd who have experienced the med themselves.

Advice on Sleep Regulation,"so i figure this is probably the best place to ask for bpd-related advice but i guess i don't really know. some lengthy backstory on my circumstances:

&gt;!i'm a career insomniac (since i was a toddler basically) and have always had difficulty waking in the morning as well, regardless of when i do successfully fall asleep. this has always had a negative impact on my performance in basically everything. i used to be able to pull all-nighters in order to be on time for important things scheduled in the morning (i did this frequently throughout college), but this is less and less the case and i know it's bad for me anyway.

as i entered my 20s, high stress, drug use, and (i'm assuming most of all) genetic factors contributed to a decline in my mental health. my emotions started to become erratic and my sleep schedule worsened. things came to a head when, during a period of high stress about two years ago, i began to hear voices. they were mostly benign, but it scared me to death and i went to my doctor. he diagnosed it as depression with psychotic features and prescribed me clonazepam and aripiprazole. i started at 5mg of the abilify, but experienced highly unpleasant akathisia and dropped the dose to 2.5mg, in combination with 100mg quetiapine. the quetiapine made me feel like shit so we got rid of that altogether and my symptoms seemed managed on the 2.5mg abilify. the klonopin worked fine and helped with my anxiety.

to the point, i am now 22. a few months ago, towards the beginning of the covid outbreak in the us (another period of high stress during which i was sent home from school and my job prospects fell apart), i began to experience new symptoms. i would go days with little sleep, feeling incredible, productive, sociable, and driven. i would spend money recklessly. then i would become incredibly depressed and/or listless and aimless and sleep for most of the day for lack of motivation to do anything else. there were points at which i was essentially catatonic. i don't know why i ignored these warning signs, but i carried on like this for a few weeks until things came to a head when my longtime girlfriend broke up with me. one morning the voices came back, but i tried to just shut them out. i couldn't be bothered to seek help anymore at that point i guess. it was only when the hallucinations became more vivid, to the point that i could no longer distinguish them from reality, that i worried. then i started to see things. vivid visual hallucinations. i still refused to seek help. only once my mother found me asleep on the living room floor in a particularly bad depressive episode, was i forced to seek help.

ultimately, the hallucinations subsided of their own accord as i got my stress levels under control. the periodic mood swings did not and it was ruining my life. at this point i had done my research and was fully aware that i was suffering from bipolar disorder. i was fortunate enough to have a family friend familiar with a nearby psychiatrist specializing in psychotic disorders. i was referred and got an appointment quickly (i consider this an act of some higher power). as i had suspected, he diagnosed me with schizoaffective bpd 2. he suggested some medications including lithium and lamotrigine.!&lt; 

the more pertinent bit:

i did my research and decided on the lamotrigine and began dose titration shortly thereafter. i recently got up to the goal dosage of 100mg and my symptoms have largely dissipated. however, i still experience periods of sleeplessness maybe every two days. it severely impacts every facet of my life and i feel like it is causing my mental state to take another turn for the worse. furthermore, i am trying to secure a job. i know that i will not be able to hold the job if i cannot regulate my erratic sleep schedule. i can tell my parents worry but don't know what to do.

i have, over the years, tried everything under the sun (prescription and otherwise) to help with my sleep and have only found two things that will both allow me to fall asleep in a timely manner and force me to wake up at a reasonable hour: alcohol, which i know will ultimately cause much more harm than good if i attempt long-term self-medication with it; and ghb, which seems more practicable. ghb, however, is illicit and fairly expensive at the dosage i would require to medicate. i am aware, however, that ghb is occasionally prescribed for narcolepsy at a fairly low dose. i am considering asking my gp (who is aware of my situation) if he will prescribe me a buttload of narcolepsy meds. i think he may be open to it, as he knows i have tried almost every alternative.

however, being realistic, this is a longshot. i was wondering if anyone here has any non-medication strategies they use to regulate bpd-related disordered sleep. i am fairly desperate at this point, so any advice is much appreciated.",1602751891,False,BPD,2020-10-15 08:51:31,"Advice on Sleep Regulation so i figure this is probably the best place to ask for bpd-related advice but i guess i don't really know. some lengthy backstory on my circumstances:

"Can BPD be ""brought out"" of an individual by medication?","i'm not sure if this is the correct place to put it, but i thought- why not post it.

can someone show signs of bpd through incorrect treatment? specifically, medication. 


my story is somewhat interesting, i suppose, and i would like to share it with you. 

&gt;i went through an extremely traumatic experience about 2 years ago. i went into the hospital for psychiatric help, in which they automatically prescribed me ativan and zoloft. i went in for a few more therapy sessions after these were prescribed, but the sessions stopped after about a month.

&gt;fast forward to a year later, the ativan was the only thing i felt was working for me. i had just started a stressful job and was in an abusive relationship. my doctors changed my zoloft to prozac, and a few months later, i went into the er due to nonstop panic attacks. 

&gt;i went back into therapy, and my doctors took me off of prozac and put me on seroquel, telling me i had borderline personality disorder since my feelings were intense, my mood swings were often, and i was exhibiting the bpd symptoms. i felt like i was legitimately going ""crazy."" all i wanted to do was sleep with people, then take my ativan and seroquel and sleep- then do it all again when i woke up. this was my vicious cycle for a few months. 

&gt;during these months, i found myself cutting. i found myself sleeping with strangers. i found myself drinking more than i felt comfortable with. i found myself pushing my friends away, then begging them to come back. life was terrible, and i didn't want to live like that anymore.

&gt;i wanted to kill myself, and after an attempt, i laid in bed for several days realizing i couldn't live like this anymore. i didn't want to go back to therapy, and all i wanted was to get better, but my impulses got the best of me.

&gt;i eventually decided to try to live without my medication. if it worked, then it worked. if it didn't, then nothing would be worse than what i was going through. 

&gt;after about a month of pure torture of being off these medications i was abusing, i came out of it better than ever. i just feel guilty for saying i got out of it in such an ""easy"" way.

First class antipsychotics for BPD?,"i'm currently admitted to a psych ward and they've been giving me huge doses of levometrazin and triapidal (antipsychotics), besides my old prescribed meds (sertraline and quetiapine) which made me feel wonderful . to give some context, i switched psych wards 2 weeks ago and my ex doctor was amazing and really did me good with my old prescription. sertraline and quetiapine literally changed my life . this new doc though, has no experience with bpd (i'm primarily here for detox) , and just keeps me giving enormous amounts of antipsychotics which only makes things worse (i get angry more easily , depressive , no joy in doing things ). 

so bottom line i don't suggest anyone with bpd to take first class antipsychotics,or do it if it's your thing and it works for me . but for me they only made me depressive and emotionally blunt so i'll just stick to my good old antidepressant and mood stabilizer once i'm out ,thank you.",1638261987,False,BPD,2021-11-30 08:46:27,"First class antipsychotics for BPD? i'm currently admitted to a psych ward and they've been giving me huge doses of levometrazin and triapidal (antipsychotics), besides my old prescribed meds (sertraline and quetiapine) which made me feel wonderful . to give some context, i switched psych wards 2 weeks ago and my ex doctor was amazing and really did me good with my old prescription. sertraline and quetiapine literally changed my life . this new doc though, has no experience with bpd (i'm primarily here for detox) , and just keeps me giving enormous amounts of antipsychotics which only makes things worse (i get angry more easily , depressive , no joy in doing things ).

Quetiapine and libido,"i've been on a high dose of quetiapine for a good while now and i'm wondering if anyone else has experience with a loss of libido while on it.
before i was put on antipsychotics i was on a series of anti-depressants but it never stopped the hallucinations so i got moved on to antipsychotics. 

anyways. i've always been a sexual person, i love sex, i love the physical experience and the emotional experience. although since being put on quetiapine i've felt no desire for sex, neither the physical closeness or the emotional.
i masturbate but even when i reach climax it's not that big a deal anymore.

my partner doesn't mind but it's driving me absolutely insane and just wondering if anyone else on quetiapine, or any other drug, that has experienced a loss of libido and managed to overcome it.
i don't want to go back to my gp because they've been eager to move me on to carbamazepine or olanzapine and i *really* don't want to go on either drug due to the physical implications they have on the body and they should really only be used if all avenues have been exhausted.

Overwhelmed by medications; looking for advice,"this is just a brief post really asking for any advice or personal experience regarding medications. i have an appointment with my gp later today (it's 2:25am here in the uk) and i'm going to try and convince him to put me on the drug topimarate (brand name topamax), which is used as a mood stabiliser, despite its main use being an anticonvulsant. 

i'm currently taking quetiapine 100mg (aka seroquel), venlafaxine (effexor) 225mg, mirtazapine 45mg (mirtaz) and propanolol 10mg, as needed. quite the cocktail. the quetiapine has definitely had the most pronounced effect on my mood, though it has led to significant weight gain (about 20lbs). i had anorexia when i was in my teens and i've felt incredibly triggered by the weight gain, as it's put me into the 'overweight' zone. i recently started purging after some meals, though i felt so dreadful afterwards that i've tried to stop. i've been going to the gym for about 12-15 hours a week and cut my calories to an amount that should lead to weight loss but to no avail. 

the main side effect of topimarate is weight loss, and according to a cochrane review of the clinical literature, and supposedly a medline review (i've not read this one myself but have seen it referenced) it is one of the drugs that has the most evidence behind it for treating bpd (i'm a psych student...) but the majority of healthcare professionals i have seen thus far are uncomfortable with the amount of medication i'm taking, especially as i am only 22. i doubt he will feel comfortable prescribing me anymore, even though i only see it as a temporary measure as the plan is to come off of the antipsychotics once i'm in the dbt program (i'm on a waiting list atm). 

i know i said this would be a quick post, my bad. has anyone had any experience with topiramate that they feel i should know, before i try begging my gp tomorrow. i think there is also a worry that i accumulate medications, as i overdosed about nine months ago (no lasting damage done) and am still having to pick up my meds in two week amounts.

I don’t understand what is happening to me and I am absolutely terrified.,"i was diagnosed with bpd in 2015. i often internalise my feelings, have varied mood swings and am a massive people pleaser. how i view myself is marked by shame or self-hatred. i am two completely different people depending on if i am at work or not in an attempt to block out the world and be good at my job. 

since being diagnosed i was housebound for six months and had very unstable relationships with my family, friends and partner causing me to isolate myself. i have been in contact with the crisis team on many occasions including having regular home visits from professionals. i have found it extremely hard to engage within my treatment and build relationships with professionals causing me to miss appointments.  

since being diagnosed with bpd i have been on a variety of medication including prn (prescribed as required or when needed) such as diazepam and risperidone. most recently i have been on venlafaxine and quetiapine. although, i have continued to experience varied mood swings whilst on this medication i feel i have been a lot more stable and able to hold down a job for a year and a half which is something that has been difficult in the past.  in early may i was hospitalised due to having urine retention. the doctors believed this was due to side effects of my medication. my psychiatrist - of whom i have been under the care of for a year and a half – chose to take me off the quetiapine and to only take it as a prn. quetiapine makes me feel extremely tired and zombified and is not something i am able to take at work. 

since being off quetiapine, my concentration and focus has declined massively. i have had so many thoughts in my head that i often shout out or talk to myself to try and release them from my head. i’m constantly replaying conversations in my head some of which are not true which is making me question reality as i truly believe what’s been said. i have had conversations with members of the public which i do not recall and truly believe have not happened. when i am reminded of the conversation, i often will make up additional things that have been said which i truly believe have happened. members of the public have noticed my behaviour and have offered me help including to ring the crisis team. i don’t feel i am in control and am scared by my thoughts and feelings. i feel extremely paranoid and feel like people are tricking me or trying to mess with my head. i feel very confused a lot of the time and don’t know what’s real and in my head. i have had to take time off work as a result. my psychiatrist has now suggested i take 50mg of quetiapine twice a day as well as having 25mg prn in the middle of the day if needed. i will also be starting dbt therapy in a week and a half with a cpn (community practice nurse).

"""On the right side of recovery"" (mentions of self harm &amp; suicidal thoughts but not in detail)","i posted this as a response to someone asking for 'depression success stories' in another sub, but i just thought i'd post it here as well in case it just lifts anyone who might be feeling down or a bit hopeless..

tw for mentions of self harm, suicidal thoughts/ideation 

i first had symptoms of depression around age 10, though my mum says i was always 'a depressed child'. i was then formally diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety at age 13 by my gp and put on antidepressants. my first suicidal thoughts came into being when i was about 14/15, i don't recall exactly when, but i was definitely still at high school because i would daydream a lot about jumping off the roof of the school building.
i was then diagnosed with bipolar 2 and psychosis at age 19 and put on antipsychotics and benzodiazapines as well as antidepressants. i was working in a cinema which i hated, i frequently self harmed by cutting- the one episode that stands out to me even now is when i found a glass bottle while cleaning a screen one day, so i took it and put it in my locker. later on my shift, i went to get the bottle and i went down the back stairs and hid under them. i smashed the bottle and used it to hurt myself. that was a bad time.

i used to take my car out after shifts and instead of going home i'd just drive for hours and hours, going nowhere, just driving. i couldn't bear going home because i felt so unhappy. i'd drive really really fast, stupidly fast, because for that few minutes i felt something other than the blank, black depression. 
one night i drove out to a motorway bridge not far from my house and stood watching the traffic. i wished i had the courage to jump but i didn't. someone called the police and they came out in two vans; after talking to me and my girlfriend via phonecall, they followed me in my car to her house, and that was that.

i got a new job and a couple of years later a new diagnosis - they said i'd been misdiagnosed and i actually had borderline personality disorder instead. i continued to sink into deeper and deeper depression, i hated myself, i hated my life, i hated everything. i felt sad, angry, numb. in 2013 i eventually lost my job because i was having to take so much time off sick, because i just couldn't cope with being in the office, i couldn't concentrate.
that was the lowest point of my life by a long way. every single day i'd wake up wishing i hadn't. i was self harming every day. i cried until i had no tears left - and that's not just a saying, i literally ran out - i'd just sit there wanting to cry and let all the sadness out, but no tears were left. i despised myself - every thought was negative, cruel, dark, suicidal. my husband got so desperate, so .. beaten down by my belief that i was better off dead, that he said to me one day ""i love you, but if you really need to do it, then i'm not going to stop you"". and we both cried together. i lived in darkness for years.
and all through this time i was on medication, and at various points i was seeing mental health professionals. the cpn i had when they told me i had bpd said that people with bpd were manipulative attention seekers who were incurable and so she didn't want to work with me any more. that did a lot to bolster my confidence.

my recovery began when i was discharged from her care. 6 months later i was in such a state i went to my gp and he immediately referred me back to services. however, because i'd moved house i was now under a different 'hub' and so a different team. i was put with the complex care and treatment team after an assessment and an appointment with a psychiatrist. that psychiatrist, i believe, was the one who saved my life. he changed my medications to venlafaxine and quetiapine which i am on to this day. i did a course of counselling and was given a care coordinator. once my meds were stable, i did a course of cbt. i was assigned a new care coordinator and we worked together on some really important things. i then did a group called life skills which was developed for people with bpd or emotional regulation problems. once that 6 month course was finished, the facilitator offered me a place on the personality disorders structured clinical management program, which is a 100-week intensive intervention program for people with bpd. he was my new care coordinator and he was the person who gave me the skills and the motivation to change my life. the program was amazing, the skills i learnt are invaluable. i did the life skills course again, and i also did a 4 month compassion focused therapy course and another round of cbt.
alongside all this, i did a lot of personal soul searching, homework, and skill practice. anyone who tells you that recovery from a mental illness is easy is lying. it takes a hell of a lot of hard work but my god it is worth it.

i am now 33 and although i will most likely be taking the venlafaxine and quetiapine for life, because i've tried to come off them and i've not done well, i'm now 1year out of services with no issues, and although i do have suicidal thoughts (part of the territory with bpd) i can use my skills and my generally good mood to cope with them.
i am 6 years clean from self harm and have a huge arsenal of skills and techniques that i've built up over my time in the various therapy programs i did, which help me every day.

in the darkest times, when i'd been depressed for years and i laid in bed begging for death, i would have laughed in your face if you'd have told me that i'd be where i am now. i genuinely thought i was never ever going to get better. i'd read stories of people who'd been depressed and got better and were all ""just hold on, it gets better!"" and i'd scoff ""yeah whatever"" and turn the page. 

but i am testament to it. it does get better.
you have to try. its not a passive thing. and thats where i went wrong. i thought it would get better on its own. but i had to work. i had to work really hard. 
but i'd do the work again a hundred times over, because being able to say ""i'm on the right side of recovery"" whenever i'm talking about my journey, feels so damn good.

by the way - i am still unemployed, it will be 8 years on the 21st feb 2021. i am on long term sick/disabled claiming esa &amp; pip for both mental and physical illnesses. however i have now started to try volunteering - i am doing 4hr/month with lancashire mind (a mental health charity) and i've just signed up with lancashire recovery college, which is a wonderful place that provides free courses on all things mental health. my title is ""volunteer recovery journey enabler""! i am also setting up a peer support group that combines art &amp; mental wellbeing. none of these take very long to do at any one time but are enough to start me back on the long road to employment.

Medication reviews for BPD?,"so i'm debating asking my dr about trying different meds for my bpd because therapy isn't really enough. i hate trying out new meds because of the possible side effects and feeling like shit while your brain adjusts to it etc. i also have anxiety and depression so i used to take lexapro (escitalopram) and wellbutrin xl but the lexapro made my ibs worse so i came off of it and am only on wellbutrin.

what medications/coping skills have helped for BPD/ADHD,"i was taking antidepressants and antipsychotics, recently ran out of the latter saw a new doctor online that diagnosed me with adhd and prescribed adderall. i’m on a very small dose and im not seeing any improvement but my anxiety/sleep have been much worse as of late, ive heard of people with adhd and bpd taking lamictal and that doesnt affect stimulants? does anyone have experience with this? considering going back to seroquel because id rather not feel a thing than feel so intensely angry and anxious.

Dangers of Mistreatment in BPD patients [TW: Mental Hospital],"allow me to preface this by stating this is my personal experience, and my view on this doesn't apply to every circumstance and situation. bpd can manifest itself in many forms, symptoms, etc. every case is different. however, i'd like to share my story. 

i have textbook bpd, all 9/9 of the dsm criteria. i have a professional diagnosis too, if that's something that matters to anyone. i've struggled with a lack of identity, emotion regulation, fear of abandonment, and all of that good stuff. my interpersonal relationships are turbulent, to say the least. 

only... no one believed me, when i'd try to tell anyone that i was struggling. i had a crying fit one night at age 17, and ended up in an emergency mental health facility. these kinds of facilities are in place for people who are violent, attempted suicide, or are having an episode of psychosis. my memory of this time is absolute crap, so i can't offer too many specifics, except that a friend feared i would end my life after some self-injury behavior, and suddenly there were policemen at my door. 

i can't even tell you anything about what happened at the emergency mental health place, but i remember the crisis specialist wearing a beige blouse, and i cried for the duration of the visit, including on the way there in the car during the police escort. this single event in itself has changed my whole life, irrevocably. this was nearly 7 years ago (coming up in november) and these actions can't be reversed.

after that night, my family went scrambling for immediate help, in the form of any type of mental health professional they could get. while i'd tried to warn people, i didn't do a good enough job, because it seems that things got out of control, and quickly in hindsight. the first port of call, in fact the only ""counselor"" in the area who had any immediate availability was a social worker. at 17, i was having trouble controlling impulses and reckless behavior, as well as paranoia. it sent anxiety through the roof when she insisted on talking to a parent without me in the room after a session. on my fourth session with her, she listened to me for about 5 minutes before stopping me to say, ""if my granddaughter ever acted the way you did, she'd be disowned."" i never went back to her. 

i honestly have no idea how much time passed between then and when i got to see my first psychiatrist. he was chronically late, rude, and had such a remarkably low affect, i didn't feel comfortable. so he started me immediately on zoloft. i think that's the tylenol of mental health medication. it wasn't long until i was able to get in somewhere else, a friendlier looking practice. i would come to have this doctor for around 5 years. 

within one session, she diagnosed me as bipolar. i accepted it, stupidly, without question. sessions were brutal, i'd even say in one she committed a serious form of malpractice. i didn't question her on her speedy diagnosis, and to this day i don't know why. immediately, this pill-happy doctor cycled me through many different types of benzos, mood stabilizers, and eventually antipsychotics. 

it was under this doctor's care that i seriously fell through the cracks. within a year of the crying episode, i'd be committed. 

for the sake of honesty, i'll admit i don't remember what led up to being dropped off at the door of a psych hospital. i've lost a few years of memory, really. what comes back is in bits and pieces. i think my brain is trying to protect me. 

the psych hospital, in short, scared the shit out of me. i don't remember the outside of the building or what it looked like, but i remember the doors. the big, scary, slamming doors that locked behind us wherever we went. thankfully, i was placed with the adolescents and not the adult unit, largely because i was still in school. i can still smell the nasty eggs they made for breakfast everyday. today, i was making coffee, and a flashback came back of the dead, vacant eyes of the fellow patients. the patients were so drugged up, they couldn't all work normally, most of them shuffled around the decrepit building with tattered pajamas and slippers. 

it's coming up to six years of this experience, and flashbacks still hit me hard, all the time. i remember my room mates, one homicidal, the other schizophrenic. all under the age of 15. i think about the writing on the wall, all in magic marker as we were not allowed anything other than soft markers or crayons. ""help me,"" was the message that stood out the most.

this didn't happen to me, but it did happen to someone in my unit. the staff does vital checks in the night. this is often terrifying, because you'll wake up suddenly and have someone standing over you. another patient reported that the aid covered their mouth as they were waking up, so that the patient wouldn't scream. when this patient protested, they were given a shot of tranquilizer. no matter how good reviews a hospital has, there is often behavior that is rigid and degrading to patients that goes unreported.

during the duration of my stay, i was cycled through more antipsychotics including seroquel. my psych didn't look like he ever wanted me released. i was getting worse the longer i spent there, and i was there a few months. i grew more insular. as someone who had bpd as opposed to bipolar, i never learned to cope with the world. 

that's what i'm wrestling with today, this year, all the time. i was drugged up, not taught to cope. a year after i was released, i was put on abilify. this drug caused dramatic, life-altering changes for me. this includes a serious weight gain (i'm talking 90-95 lbs in four years), the occasional tremor, and now i'm looking at type 2 diabetic symptoms and pcos. i have since received a proper diagnosis, i have been taken off the antipsychotics safely. i am working on getting my physical health under control, even while my mental health is suffering. i have terrible sensory issues, hyper-vigilance. i don't trust mental health professionals anymore, although i am starting dbt next week. had i been properly treated and diagnosed, i know i wouldn't gotten the help i need.

the point i'm trying to drive home in this post is that not all mental health treatments are one-size-fits all. by that i mean, if you're unsure about a diagnosis, get a second eval! don't let a doctor intimidate you, and if you find yourself in turmoil, get targeted therapy. my issue with long-term hospitalization for bpd patients is that they are not taught to deal with the real world. i don't want what happened to me to happen to anyone else. thank you for reading. 

&amp;#x200b;",1536449394,False,BPD,2018-09-08 23:29:54,"Dangers of Mistreatment in BPD patients [TW: Mental Hospital] allow me to preface this by stating this is my personal experience, and my view on this doesn't apply to every circumstance and situation. bpd can manifest itself in many forms, symptoms, etc. every case is different. however, i'd like to share my story. 

i have textbook bpd, all 9/9 of the dsm criteria. i have a professional diagnosis too, if that's something that matters to anyone. i've struggled with a lack of identity, emotion regulation, fear of abandonment, and all of that good stuff. my interpersonal relationships are turbulent, to say the least. 

only... no one believed me, when i'd try to tell anyone that i was struggling. i had a crying fit one night at age 17, and ended up in an emergency mental health facility. these kinds of facilities are in place for people who are violent, attempted suicide, or are having an episode of psychosis. my memory of this time is absolute crap, so i can't offer too many specifics, except that a friend feared i would end my life after some self-injury behavior, and suddenly there were policemen at my door. 

i can't even tell you anything about what happened at the emergency mental health place, but i remember the crisis specialist wearing a beige blouse, and i cried for the duration of the visit, including on the way there in the car during the police escort. this single event in itself has changed my whole life, irrevocably. this was nearly 7 years ago (coming up in november) and these actions can't be reversed.

after that night, my family went scrambling for immediate help, in the form of any type of mental health professional they could get. while i'd tried to warn people, i didn't do a good enough job, because it seems that things got out of control, and quickly in hindsight. the first port of call, in fact the only ""counselor"" in the area who had any immediate availability was a social worker. at 17, i was having trouble controlling impulses and reckless behavior, as well as paranoia. it sent anxiety through the roof when she insisted on talking to a parent without me in the room after a session. on my fourth session with her, she listened to me for about 5 minutes before stopping me to say, ""if my granddaughter ever acted the way you did, she'd be disowned."" i never went back to her. 

i honestly have no idea how much time passed between then and when i got to see my first psychiatrist. he was chronically late, rude, and had such a remarkably low affect, i didn't feel comfortable. so he started me immediately on zoloft. i think that's the tylenol of mental health medication. it wasn't long until i was able to get in somewhere else, a friendlier looking practice. i would come to have this doctor for around 5 years. 

within one session, she diagnosed me as bipolar. i accepted it, stupidly, without question. sessions were brutal, i'd even say in one she committed a serious form of malpractice. i didn't question her on her speedy diagnosis, and to this day i don't know why. immediately, this pill-happy doctor cycled me through many different types of benzos, mood stabilizers, and eventually antipsychotics.

Ever wondered what it’s like to be in a relationship with someone with BPD?,"there is a lot of words here. please save it and read when you can. tw: note that there are references to abuse, rape and some other things that may be triggering. i typed this while in different cycles, and have not proof read as it is too painful right now. i apologise for any mistakes. 


day 1

i’ve learned a lot about myself in the last year. i’ve learned what it is i need to work on and i know what a long and difficult road it will be to notice differences in those things. i write this as someone who has lost the thing that gave them the determination to acknowledge, to research, to become aware. it isn’t something i can do alone, and it’s not something i can afford to do quickly. 

i wanted to write something, because i have been embarrassed at how i react. sometimes so publicly, with so much spite. it’s as though i want someone to feel all the hurt i’ve ever felt. it’s childish, it’s humiliating and it’s not an excuse but i seem incapable of stopping it. 

i only ever feel good or bad or nothing. there is no in between, no moment i feel a bit of both. no moment where i feel a bit bad, but good enough that i can talk about it sensibly, resolve it and move on. when a bad thing happens, even if it’s minor, a lot of bad things come back at once. sometimes, it’s clear that’s what’s happening and on rare days i can control myself better, i can stop myself from escalating a situation from nothing to something difficult to repair. on the more frequent bad days, i realise what i’m doing but only after using past hurt as a weapon. sometimes that person causes it. sometimes they have not been there for me in a way i need, but can’t explain. on other days, it doesn’t feel so clear. all the pain i’ve experienced just gels into a thick paste that covers everything that was ever good. i can’t recognise that what i’m feeling is pain beyond the situation that i’m in. 

a bad day starts with distancing, promises that i’m fine, a genuine but futile attempt to stop myself in my tracks. i will say this while vacantly staring at walls, scratching my chest, avoiding eye contact, changes in the way i speak, address people, acknowledge people, changes in the way i act. i feel incapable of stopping my reactions, so saying i’m fine seems a bit pointless. but i say it, and every time i hope it just disappears, but it doesn’t. physically, it feels like my head is vibrating. all the painful things just bouncing from side to side against my skull. when i shut my eyes, i visualise nothing. there is nothing but black. when i focus on what i can hear, there is a loud buzzing noise, with the world continuing quietly in the background. people who are close to me and addressing me directly feel and sound miles away. 

dissociation. what feels like the mental equivalent of running away. i disappear. the previous strong, painful emotions seem to numb. exactly the same as when you take some paracetamol for a headache and you have the few minutes of it getting better but not feeling quite right? that’s it. bpd is the headache, and dissociation is the painkiller. 

but here is the problem. now, i feel nothing. it happens most times. i start to feel a lot, so i guess my mind attempts to protect itself by removing anything that might evoke emotion. if this really was just a headache, that wouldn’t be an issue. but this isn’t, this is a huge cancerous tumour that is swelling my the second. so the painkiller can only numb it for so long. i wish i could capitalise on it. make the most of the numbness, somehow use it to avoid an escalation. i just can’t. it’s like i’m not there, the people around me aren’t there, i hear that people are speaking but i can’t process it, i often can’t respond or have limited, child-like speech. i can’t move, and become dehydrated quickly. i don’t like to be touched or comforted. while writing this, i realise that if i could accept affection while in this state, it may make a positive difference to how i am when i float back down to earth. 

while writing this i have also realised, that upon the many discoveries i have made in my quest to understand my mental abnormalities, that i have never known what causes the dissociation period to end. i realise now that i have little memory of what happens during those times. maybe i don’t like being touched because it begins the reintroduction into reality? maybe that’s why i can’t speak. am i in some sort of paralytic dream-like state? i am certain of one thing, the paralysis is different depending on the emotion i’m withholding. 

but for whatever reason, it always does end. there always gets to a point where there’s not a force capable of holding it - whatever it is - back from rearing it’s ugly head. my anger, my sadness, my euphoria, they are powerful. you can almost see, and smell and taste it. as it’s been the most frequent of late, we will discuss the anger. you can sense the eruption in every way. time to walk on eggshells. a friend of mine once said that ‘there are a million ways to get it wrong, and only one to get it right’. that is something that weighs the heaviest to me. how helpless must you feel to be someone trying to make another feel more grounded, to find that you can’t. if you’re lucky enough to find something that works, don’t relax just yet because it won’t every time. 

and then the cycle of hurt continues. and i don’t remember always the specifics, i just remember how that person has made me feel before. any time they’ve ever got it wrong, it comes flooding in at once and it’s just so unbearable, so consuming. i can’t sleep it off, i shut my eyes and all i see is cars crashing. i don’t really know where this comes from but i suppose it’s just another, more simple way of visualising a disaster i feel is out of my control. there is nothing but pain, there are no positive thoughts i can use to try and replace the negative ones. 

it is exhausting. whatever the emotion is, it’s the same cycle. i feel all the anger, or all the sad, or all the happiness. i martyr the people i love and then kick the ladder from under their feet and watch them plummet and become someone i have demonised. it all goes back to the same issue. to me, someone can only be good or bad. a person that causes pain or relieves it. there’s no middle ground, there’s no chance of being a good person that makes mistakes. just good or bad. 

the emotional manipulation is heavy. it’s difficult to prevent, because i feel so strongly one way or the other. i’m so afraid of being alone, losing someone i love. the first sign of abandonment, i will feel so adamant that my life is better without them. leave, if that’s what you want. leave, i want you to. i never wanted you. you have ruined me. the way i feel is because of the things you do. i become so abusive, so defensive. and what follows that is sheer desperation at the thought of losing the person i told to leave. i think any one who has ever loved me, has felt trapped. it’s not okay, it’s never been okay i know that but i just don’t know how to stop. i can’t imagine how it feels for someone being with me in these states. like if you leave, you live with the consequences of me not being able to cope. just like everything else, the desperation and panic controls me. i’m pretty likely to cause physical harm to myself, overdose, drive in conditions i shouldn’t be driving in.

and then i apologise. i beg for forgiveness. i promise things will be different and that i can change. i so desperately want them to. i feel like i can’t breathe until i am loved again. i try so hard to stay calm and not react to things, not to make someone feel so awful about themselves about something so minor. something i know myself won’t matter in hours to come. why is the force that takes over me so strong that i can’t prevent a reaction? anyway, this lasts for a couple of days, generally. vary rarely more than a week. all the things that piss me off during an angry cycle seem to not affect me. the person is martyred again. they can do no wrong. 

so i love big, and i love strong and i love so much that it tempts people in. i know it can make others feel amazing about themselves, having someone that hangs on your every word, someone that is 100% interested in every move you make, every word you say. someone who validates you constantly. doesn’t stop letting you know the positive impact you’ve made on their life. someone that genuinely puts your life ahead of their own. will cancel their plans and put yours first. it’s easy to fall into the trap. it is nice, and not all that common to be loved to the extent that i mean. it can make the awful bits, the manipulative bits, seem worth it. it seems like it’s an easy thing to do, walk away from manipulation. it’s not so easy to walk away from this side of it though. 

my perception of the people i love the most changes constantly and rapidly. i no longer know what is real or what is imagined. i no longer know who to trust and who to avoid. i don’t know who to cut from my life, and who to keep. i feel like i’m losing my mind a bit more each day, my grasp on reality has faded and all my lines are so blurred. i don’t know where my boundaries are, or who is crossing them and when. i don’t know what is forgiveness and what is a desperate desire to not be alone. i don’t know what it is to love separately from what it is to need. i don’t know what thoughts or feelings of mine are genuine any more. 

this is, believe it or not, a short version of what it’s like being in a relationship with someone who has an untreated mental illness. it’s harder than you could imagine. add some lovely fresh trauma to that, and you’ve got yourself a permanent rollercoaster of emotion that will, probably, be difficult to sever your ties with. i don’t ever want the people i love to feel trapped. i am sorry for what some people have endured, and i’m sorry for the neglect i’ve placed on others. 


day 2. 

i write this cautiously. i feel so different to how i felt yesterday. so numb. the lines that draw my boundaries are more blurred than ever, today. i feel like a different person, living through the same situation but with a different outlook. i feel more objective. like i’m looking at the situation from more angles than just my own. 

i thought about what i wrote yesterday. i still believe a lot of it is true, but i think i was more justified in my reactions than i wanted to give myself credit for. the person who i love the most hurt me time and time again. he gave little consideration as to how you fix a mistake, a mistake like cheating on me with your ex, the mother of your child, someone who will remain in our lives forever. did he give any real consideration at all in how you work to fix that? 

or did he keep lying, day after day? or did he lie sometimes and other times let his own resentment for how hard he had to work to try and fix things take things take leadership, so like telling the truth but not caring enough to really convince me? there have been lies. there have been lies about who he is speaking to, there have been hidden social media accounts that he kept me blocked on. there have been conversations with the woman in question in which he lied multiple times, about them ever taking place and their content - about how he misses her. there have been lies about what he is really thinking?

now that last one can’t be proved, but with a years worth of other lies, am i really that crazy for thinking it might be? how 5 days ago he told me we would face anything together, and moments later told me there is no hope. he can’t help how he feels. i’m so angry, i am so fucking hurt. is it a lie or did he just feel that differently that quickly? was he maybe even lying to himself?

regardless, i begged. i promised myself i wouldn’t, but i did. i asked if there would ever still be hope for me to prove i can change and make him happy again. he said ‘always’. i told him everything that has changed for me. what i’m going to do to be better. what changes i have made to improve myself and be someone capable of accepting love again. i told him why it is different now, and what made me complacent before. i think i meant it all. i really do think things can change. therapy starts for me on 20th, i have new medication (again), the lockdown in the uk eases on 12th. there are more opportunities for me to try something different than there has been since we started dating. 

he was interested. he said he would come round to talk. i was ready. i felt 100% like it was the right decision, to keep trying. i love him and my life without him seems so directionless and empty. i was planning what to say, how to make him turn my 1% chance into a possibility, and then into a probability, and then a reality. i was brimming with excitement. i felt hope again. 

i shouldn’t have begged, i know. the trouble with using emotional manipulation is it tends to get you what you need to stop the pain. sometimes, when i’m in extreme emotional suffering, which is unfortunately more common for me than some other people, once again, due to the splitting and only ever seeing good or bad, i have imagined physical pains. i clench my jaw so tightly that it starts to feel like my teeth are falling out, my whole face is on fire and i can’t stop clutching at my jaw and applying pressure desperately trying to relieve it. again, it’s all pretty fucked up. often, the pain doesn’t exist. i have many pain killers to hand, after jumping 45ft to escape a potential murderer and confirmed rapist, and a car crash. i am stacking. i take codeine, naproxen, tramadol. even morphine. the pain is relentless, it doesn’t stop. i take handfuls. it does not stop. but take away whatever is causing anxiety, whether it’s ending an argument or taking valium or being admitted to hospital and replacing the anxiety with something new. it goes. and i’m just left uncomfortably numb. 

i am ashamed to admit, that the physical and the emotional distress causes me to use manipulation tactics to feel better. i avoid it at all costs but just like the rest of it, i really just can’t stop sometimes. if i’m given a window, i will use it. so i begged. he texted me saying he was sad and lost, and when i said i was too, he asked if i wanted to see him. i have asked him to stop texting. i have told him if you give me anything to hang on to, i will use it. he continued to text me. asking where i am, if i got home okay etc. 

i tried. i tried the sensible option of saying no, because it will hurt more when he leaves but i couldn’t stop thinking. there is always hope - for as long as he cares how i feel, there must be. so i asked what i asked about, you know if the window is still open for me and like i said, i was all excited and then it left. i’m not joking, i could feel it leave my body like going from hot to cold in just a second. emotional chilblains. he said not to start thinking in a week it would all be forgotten about and we would be back to normal. 

i switched. i wondered how he would have the audacity to warn me. i thought about every time he has hurt me. i previously said that sometimes i feel the blanket, the reminder of hurt, not what it was specifically that happened. today wasn’t that. today the specific details came back. every time he has ever lied. every time he put his feelings ahead of mine. every time he promised me the world and never delivered. i remembered it all. i remembered feeling it, hearing it. i remember seeing his face as he has to explain why he chose to lie. i could feel my heart racing again, like it did at the time. i could feel the cold. for some reason, in certain anxiety-inducing situations, i find i feel cold rather than hot - like i said before, i can feel the heat leave my body.  i felt that. every time i shut my eyes, this time i could see him and i sitting in my car. i picked i different lie each time and relived each experience like it was happening again. the songs i was listening to. me begging for the truth. sitting side by side, not looking in each others eyes, me driving aimlessly hundreds of miles, begging begging begging. his face, i think about it, i think about the look he gets when he’s been caught out again and god, why did i ever bother? why would i care so much about someone who done so much damage?

now here’s the bit that’s interesting. i felt all of that. he texted me saying he ‘believes that i can be different but needs to see it’ and ‘not to expect us to be back together in a week’ at 12.58. i replied saying i need some resolutions from you too, and that i don’t want things back to normal without change considering he’s hurt me periodically for a year at 13.01. i texted him saying i don’t want him to come round, i am not trying any more, i don’t know why i ever thought i would, told him to stop texting me and fucking with my head etc - i texted this at 13.02. 

in 3-4 minutes, i relived a year of lies. i relived every time he promised he would be there and let me down. every time i cried myself to sleep and he wasn’t there. every time he lost his shit at me without reason. i didn’t just remember it. i relived it. every smell, every taste. like i was there. 

in 4 minutes. in 4 minutes i went from feeling like my life wasn’t worth living without him, and cutting my legs with broken shards of glass, emptying pills into a glass and drinking vodka at 10am, to thinking the only life not worth living, is the one i share with him. in 4 minutes i went from wanting to try anything to save us, to wanting to hear him say he was wrong for how he treated me too - enough that it took over anything else that was important. 

it’s been about 2 hours, and i feel nothing. i feel indifferent. even as i type, he doesn’t cross my mind. i can’t visualise his face, or his voice. i can’t imagine the comfort of his arms around my shoulders and pulling me in. i’m typing it, but i can’t feel it any more. i don’t feel sad, or happy, nor angry. i feel as though i am a passenger. i don’t feel hot or cold. the tv is on, but i can’t concentrate on it. i’ve watched the last episode of behind her eyes 4 times this morning. it’s like i’m phasing in and out of consciousness. 

i feel nothing. and i think one thing, over and over again. am i going crazy? am i wrong for expecting allowances for my behaviour on the basis that not only can i not help it, but unavoidable and extreme trauma towards someone you love should create some sort of shield? that i can have an exceptionally bad day without extreme consequence. like i can snap and he understands and comforts rather than being anger. he used to, and we were so happy. he handled it in such a moving way, so gracious and so strong. he wouldn’t let me walk over him, but had some leniency before retaliation. 

am i crazy? is it wrong to expect that? i never did, but he told me he would make things better for me and to trust him and to date him. i don’t hold any resentment there today, i understand how someone could feel like they can save you when they don’t understand the extent of the damage. on another day, i hate him with every molecule for not listening to me and being so naive. on other days, i love him more, for knowing how hard it would be and still having that faith and wanting to try regardless. 

i was wrong when i said that all my lines are blurred. there is only one today. the line of human decency, the power of love and what to expect from people. i don’t know if i’m wrong to think he could’ve handled it 1000 times better on 1000 different occasions.

i am certain of one thing today. i will not text him. i will not say i was wrong to say i won’t try. i will not apologise. i will, however, shower, and do my hair and put on some make up, and stay awake and sober-ish. just in case he surprises me, comes bursting through my door saying he will try as hard as i want to. just in case. 

day 3. 

today is a hateful day. today is one of the ones where i am a good person, and he is a bad person. today is the opposite of day 1. i guess day 2 was my dissociation period. everything hurts so much today. it’s like how yesterday started, but without the relieving numbness after it. it’s actually the evening of the same day, but it feels like i’ve been in pain for weeks and months, not literally a couple of hours. 

i wrote him a letter. i’m not going to send it, but i couldn’t articulate how i was feeling without addressing him directly. so i will use that letter in place of me talking through my feelings. 

‘one last thing i will say for you to think about. realise that i cannot truly forgive, if i do not understand. i have told you why i can’t bring it (the cheating and other lies) up in a calm way, and i hope that, overall, i’ve created a relationship where you feel comfortable being honest with me and telling me the whole truth, and talking about it long enough that you might understand it better yourself shouldn’t be the most terrifying thing? 

i’ve told you it is what i need. transparency is the most expected thing to want after being cheated on, yet on and off for different reasons you make it seem like it’s such a difficult task for you, or like you’re always fucking it up. it’s not that difficult, and your responses to the times i have something to bring up, increasingly make the situation worse and put me in a position where i don’t feel comfortable any more, so now i’m defensive. we can’t have a conversation about anything real, because from the moment you cunt off, we are just battling against each other being defensive and then apologetic. these times, and absolutely no other times but the times where it seems like you’ve lied or deceived or avoided the truth - if you want things to work, you have to learn to put your feelings to the side to hear what i’m saying before it escalates to something bigger - like me just thinking you’re nasty or you don’t want me because i’m useless and i don’t try or i’m wrong to feel how i feel or i should’ve gotten over it by now. you take away the part of me, that no matter how angry, would always still explain why i feel how i feel, and you would understand better and not feel as angry!! you make me close up. i have never and will never expect you to not react when it’s not directly related to you cheating on me and it being something i’ve told you i need your help to heal from. anything else, react as you want - it won’t go as terribly as you think. 

so that place i create for you, and you might not feel it much any more, but the one where you can tell me anything and i will listen. the times immediately after where i would let you talk and not get mad - they come back if one: you use them to benefit our relationship in some way and two: if you give me those same spaces when i need them, even at the expense of how you feel. i did that for you - i let myself hurt so i could be someone you spoke to about what you done. you were that person for me once. you are not any more. 

you start a conversation with me about it. you tell me how sick you feel at what you done and how you wonder if you could ever forgive yourself. you remind yourself it’s the worst thing you’ve done and to someone that had only ever loved you. and then you talk to me. and i talk back, and i get the answers that i want. ‘it just happened’ isn’t good enough, neither is self sabotage or you were reminded of the way things used to be. i don’t give a fuck if you want to get over it, you get over it with me by helping me. i deserve that from you. i want the loose ends tied, i want specifics. i want you to fucking hear me when i say that your honesty about what happened and why, will never hurt more than every time i am reminded that there is more to this that i am yet to learn. it is a safe place. i want to know. i beg you time and time again. i want you to feel how i feel just for a day, and use it to help us. help me trust you won’t do it again. help me believe your version by telling me how you felt, and not just what you done. i can’t bring this up, because you act like this. you get defensive. you know i still don’t trust you, you know i still struggle most days with what happened - but i need you to be ready, on your terms, and want to talk to me and finally help me heal. 

but you don’t.

i’ve come to realise that when i’m not dealing with the trauma you put me through, i can be an amazing person. i can be kind, considerate, empathetic, loving, loyal, unwavering. increasingly, i am none of those things when i am with you and i don’t want to lose sight of the person i worked hard to be. i will not let you, my dad, my rapist, or anyone else that has caused me years worth of psychological damage be the same people that cause me to lose my character and who i am as a person. you took my trust, and that is all you will take. i will not give you the release of knowing that i caused this by staying with you, as much as you caused it with your actions. 

just know that i have tried. you tell me every time i have an issue with your lack of transparency that you feel i don’t try at all. but i try every day to word things a little kinder, to not act like every issue is the end of our relationship. i try to give you space to explain before i accuse. i try every day by cuddling you to sleep and by waking up with you each morning. i try, when i say i love you even on the days i don’t think you deserve to hear it. i try every time there is someone that has been as loyal to me as i have them, that i let down to spend time reconciling with you. 

i do not deserve to have my feelings ridiculed and put down. you created a victim, so you allow that victim the space they need to heal at your own expense or you walk away. you do not, and unfortunately, for a long time will not have the same right to anger that i have. i recognise that you’re a human being with reactions, regardless of the past - but it is your responsibility to manage those reactions in a way that lets me feel openly about what you done and what you continue to do when you deceive. 

you have put too much attention on trying to make our days perfect and argument-free rather than real. you work on today rather than the future. you live in some sort of fear of being reminded about what you done, and somehow expect me to absorb that, alone, every day. 

you chose to date a girl that had been brutally raped and kidnapped just a couple of months before dating you. whose parents explosive separation caused her to have no contact with either of them. who had been wrestling with loneliness and mental health disorders. i don’t expect you to understand how to manage that without my help - but i expected you to stay faithful. 

you can downplay it as much as you want, and you can say i’m using it as an excuse, but does it really matter? the reality is, you sat in a police interview room with me, as the one person i was allowed to bring with me due to covid-19. you held my hand and cried with me as you watched a monster get sentenced to over 20 years in prison. you heard every second of what i endured that day - what he said to me, what he done to me and sat with me knowing there was more endurance to come. that 3 days before you sat in that room with me, you made a decision to be unfaithful. you heard me say in my witness impact statement that i don’t know how i will ever trust someone again. it’s not an excuse, it is a fact.  

i can’t continue to try while you sit there blaming the victim you helped create.’

what i want to say, or rather scream in his face before melting to the floor, is how dare he? how dare he let me fall in love with him, put me through this and then leave me? he should be begging, not me. he should be the one who feels like they’ve lost someone who made their life great - not me. as i write this, the self resentment is closing in so i can’t really say it with as much conviction as i would’ve done an hour ago. 

maybe we are both just awful. maybe we just weren’t right. maybe i am a little bit crazy, or completely fucked up. maybe he is a bit of a dickhead and maybe he could’ve been better. maybe i’ve been gaslit for months and that has fucked my perception on reality. that’s what my friends say, my colleagues, people that know us both. they say he was wrong to treat me how he did, and i have nothing to feel this crippling self loathing for. maybe i’ve gaslit them into thinking that. 

my head feels like ants. like white noise. like tens of millions of these little dots and lines just vibrating around between my eyes. 

i have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder for 12 years. i have ptsd. i have tried lithium, venlafaxine, sodium volproate, citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, mirtazapine and quetiapine, that i can remember. many more from years ago, but these are the ones most recently. i haven’t found one effective enough to keep me out of hospital and safe. i certainly have not found anything that balances my mood. they are good for different things, some have helped me get to sleep, stay asleep, some have given me a head start on happiness in the mornings, some have turned the buzzing noise down on some of the days. 

i have had talking therapy. mainly for ptsd. i have learned about grounding techniques, but nothing that has helped in my relationship. i have seen 7 different therapists/psychiatrists in the last 14 months. i have been firm in what i need, and that is not trauma focused therapy but dbt. the more recent psychiatrists have agreed, and the ball is rolling, i have my first session with a ‘specialist’ on 20th april and i refuse to stop telling people what i need until i get it. i am grateful to have health professionals on my side, after many years of them working against me. 

dbt is hard to find. not all therapists offer it and it is expensive. you need individual sessions and group sessions to the tune of around £125 a week. it’s made more difficult by being only phone or zoom based now. i know i have slightly different ways of projecting myself based on the medium, so i hope for face to face sessions to resume soon. i have looked into rehabs. i would say that what i experience is not much different to an addiction. rather than taking something i know is bad in the long run, i say something. i guess it’s all to do with feeling a lack of control over my actions. rehab will be my next step. this will cost £3000 for 3 months, with 12 months of follow ups.


thank you everyone that took the time to read this. i am not looking for your opinions on my relationship. i just needed to vent. i thought it may even help someone. maybe someone reading this feels the same buzzing i do, and this might help them recognise it. maybe it’s your partner, and reading this helps you to identify the issues and work with them to get better. it helps me to write, and to try and organise my thoughts and i appreciate that this is insanely wordy, but it’s a relief to type and another relief to post.",1616942423,False,BPD,2021-03-28 14:40:23,"Ever wondered what it’s like to be in a relationship with someone with BPD? there is a lot of words here. please save it and read when you can. tw: note that there are references to abuse, rape and some other things that may be triggering. i typed this while in different cycles, and have not proof read as it is too painful right now. i apologise for any mistakes. 


day 1

i’ve learned a lot about myself in the last year. i’ve learned what it is i need to work on and i know what a long and difficult road it will be to notice differences in those things. i write this as someone who has lost the thing that gave them the determination to acknowledge, to research, to become aware. it isn’t something i can do alone, and it’s not something i can afford to do quickly. 

i wanted to write something, because i have been embarrassed at how i react. sometimes so publicly, with so much spite. it’s as though i want someone to feel all the hurt i’ve ever felt. it’s childish, it’s humiliating and it’s not an excuse but i seem incapable of stopping it. 

i only ever feel good or bad or nothing. there is no in between, no moment i feel a bit of both. no moment where i feel a bit bad, but good enough that i can talk about it sensibly, resolve it and move on. when a bad thing happens, even if it’s minor, a lot of bad things come back at once. sometimes, it’s clear that’s what’s happening and on rare days i can control myself better, i can stop myself from escalating a situation from nothing to something difficult to repair. on the more frequent bad days, i realise what i’m doing but only after using past hurt as a weapon. sometimes that person causes it. sometimes they have not been there for me in a way i need, but can’t explain. on other days, it doesn’t feel so clear. all the pain i’ve experienced just gels into a thick paste that covers everything that was ever good. i can’t recognise that what i’m feeling is pain beyond the situation that i’m in. 

a bad day starts with distancing, promises that i’m fine, a genuine but futile attempt to stop myself in my tracks. i will say this while vacantly staring at walls, scratching my chest, avoiding eye contact, changes in the way i speak, address people, acknowledge people, changes in the way i act. i feel incapable of stopping my reactions, so saying i’m fine seems a bit pointless. but i say it, and every time i hope it just disappears, but it doesn’t. physically, it feels like my head is vibrating. all the painful things just bouncing from side to side against my skull. when i shut my eyes, i visualise nothing. there is nothing but black. when i focus on what i can hear, there is a loud buzzing noise, with the world continuing quietly in the background. people who are close to me and addressing me directly feel and sound miles away. 

dissociation. what feels like the mental equivalent of running away. i disappear. the previous strong, painful emotions seem to numb. exactly the same as when you take some paracetamol for a headache and you have the few minutes of it getting better but not feeling quite right? that’s it. bpd is the headache, and dissociation is the painkiller. 

but here is the problem. now, i feel nothing. it happens most times. i start to feel a lot, so i guess my mind attempts to protect itself by removing anything that might evoke emotion. if this really was just a headache, that wouldn’t be an issue. but this isn’t, this is a huge cancerous tumour that is swelling my the second. so the painkiller can only numb it for so long. i wish i could capitalise on it. make the most of the numbness, somehow use it to avoid an escalation. i just can’t. it’s like i’m not there, the people around me aren’t there, i hear that people are speaking but i can’t process it, i often can’t respond or have limited, child-like speech. i can’t move, and become dehydrated quickly. i don’t like to be touched or comforted. while writing this, i realise that if i could accept affection while in this state, it may make a positive difference to how i am when i float back down to earth. 

while writing this i have also realised, that upon the many discoveries i have made in my quest to understand my mental abnormalities, that i have never known what causes the dissociation period to end. i realise now that i have little memory of what happens during those times. maybe i don’t like being touched because it begins the reintroduction into reality? maybe that’s why i can’t speak. am i in some sort of paralytic dream-like state? i am certain of one thing, the paralysis is different depending on the emotion i’m withholding. 

but for whatever reason, it always does end. there always gets to a point where there’s not a force capable of holding it - whatever it is - back from rearing it’s ugly head. my anger, my sadness, my euphoria, they are powerful. you can almost see, and smell and taste it. as it’s been the most frequent of late, we will discuss the anger. you can sense the eruption in every way. time to walk on eggshells. a friend of mine once said that ‘there are a million ways to get it wrong, and only one to get it right’. that is something that weighs the heaviest to me. how helpless must you feel to be someone trying to make another feel more grounded, to find that you can’t. if you’re lucky enough to find something that works, don’t relax just yet because it won’t every time. 

and then the cycle of hurt continues. and i don’t remember always the specifics, i just remember how that person has made me feel before. any time they’ve ever got it wrong, it comes flooding in at once and it’s just so unbearable, so consuming. i can’t sleep it off, i shut my eyes and all i see is cars crashing. i don’t really know where this comes from but i suppose it’s just another, more simple way of visualising a disaster i feel is out of my control. there is nothing but pain, there are no positive thoughts i can use to try and replace the negative ones. 

it is exhausting. whatever the emotion is, it’s the same cycle. i feel all the anger, or all the sad, or all the happiness. i martyr the people i love and then kick the ladder from under their feet and watch them plummet and become someone i have demonised. it all goes back to the same issue. to me, someone can only be good or bad. a person that causes pain or relieves it. there’s no middle ground, there’s no chance of being a good person that makes mistakes. just good or bad. 

the emotional manipulation is heavy. it’s difficult to prevent, because i feel so strongly one way or the other. i’m so afraid of being alone, losing someone i love. the first sign of abandonment, i will feel so adamant that my life is better without them. leave, if that’s what you want. leave, i want you to. i never wanted you. you have ruined me. the way i feel is because of the things you do. i become so abusive, so defensive. and what follows that is sheer desperation at the thought of losing the person i told to leave. i think any one who has ever loved me, has felt trapped. it’s not okay, it’s never been okay i know that but i just don’t know how to stop. i can’t imagine how it feels for someone being with me in these states. like if you leave, you live with the consequences of me not being able to cope. just like everything else, the desperation and panic controls me. i’m pretty likely to cause physical harm to myself, overdose, drive in conditions i shouldn’t be driving in.

and then i apologise. i beg for forgiveness. i promise things will be different and that i can change. i so desperately want them to. i feel like i can’t breathe until i am loved again. i try so hard to stay calm and not react to things, not to make someone feel so awful about themselves about something so minor. something i know myself won’t matter in hours to come. why is the force that takes over me so strong that i can’t prevent a reaction? anyway, this lasts for a couple of days, generally. vary rarely more than a week. all the things that piss me off during an angry cycle seem to not affect me. the person is martyred again. they can do no wrong. 

so i love big, and i love strong and i love so much that it tempts people in. i know it can make others feel amazing about themselves, having someone that hangs on your every word, someone that is 100% interested in every move you make, every word you say. someone who validates you constantly. doesn’t stop letting you know the positive impact you’ve made on their life. someone that genuinely puts your life ahead of their own. will cancel their plans and put yours first. it’s easy to fall into the trap. it is nice, and not all that common to be loved to the extent that i mean. it can make the awful bits, the manipulative bits, seem worth it. it seems like it’s an easy thing to do, walk away from manipulation. it’s not so easy to walk away from this side of it though. 

my perception of the people i love the most changes constantly and rapidly. i no longer know what is real or what is imagined. i no longer know who to trust and who to avoid. i don’t know who to cut from my life, and who to keep. i feel like i’m losing my mind a bit more each day, my grasp on reality has faded and all my lines are so blurred. i don’t know where my boundaries are, or who is crossing them and when. i don’t know what is forgiveness and what is a desperate desire to not be alone. i don’t know what it is to love separately from what it is to need. i don’t know what thoughts or feelings of mine are genuine any more. 

this is, believe it or not, a short version of what it’s like being in a relationship with someone who has an untreated mental illness. it’s harder than you could imagine. add some lovely fresh trauma to that, and you’ve got yourself a permanent rollercoaster of emotion that will, probably, be difficult to sever your ties with. i don’t ever want the people i love to feel trapped. i am sorry for what some people have endured, and i’m sorry for the neglect i’ve placed on others. 


day 2. 

i write this cautiously. i feel so different to how i felt yesterday. so numb. the lines that draw my boundaries are more blurred than ever, today. i feel like a different person, living through the same situation but with a different outlook. i feel more objective. like i’m looking at the situation from more angles than just my own. 

i thought about what i wrote yesterday. i still believe a lot of it is true, but i think i was more justified in my reactions than i wanted to give myself credit for. the person who i love the most hurt me time and time again. he gave little consideration as to how you fix a mistake, a mistake like cheating on me with your ex, the mother of your child, someone who will remain in our lives forever. did he give any real consideration at all in how you work to fix that? 

or did he keep lying, day after day? or did he lie sometimes and other times let his own resentment for how hard he had to work to try and fix things take things take leadership, so like telling the truth but not caring enough to really convince me? there have been lies. there have been lies about who he is speaking to, there have been hidden social media accounts that he kept me blocked on. there have been conversations with the woman in question in which he lied multiple times, about them ever taking place and their content - about how he misses her. there have been lies about what he is really thinking?

now that last one can’t be proved, but with a years worth of other lies, am i really that crazy for thinking it might be? how 5 days ago he told me we would face anything together, and moments later told me there is no hope. he can’t help how he feels. i’m so angry, i am so fucking hurt. is it a lie or did he just feel that differently that quickly? was he maybe even lying to himself?

regardless, i begged. i promised myself i wouldn’t, but i did. i asked if there would ever still be hope for me to prove i can change and make him happy again. he said ‘always’. i told him everything that has changed for me. what i’m going to do to be better. what changes i have made to improve myself and be someone capable of accepting love again. i told him why it is different now, and what made me complacent before. i think i meant it all. i really do think things can change. therapy starts for me on 20th, i have new medication (again), the lockdown in the uk eases on 12th. there are more opportunities for me to try something different than there has been since we started dating. 

he was interested. he said he would come round to talk. i was ready. i felt 100% like it was the right decision, to keep trying. i love him and my life without him seems so directionless and empty. i was planning what to say, how to make him turn my 1% chance into a possibility, and then into a probability, and then a reality. i was brimming with excitement. i felt hope again. 

i shouldn’t have begged, i know. the trouble with using emotional manipulation is it tends to get you what you need to stop the pain. sometimes, when i’m in extreme emotional suffering, which is unfortunately more common for me than some other people, once again, due to the splitting and only ever seeing good or bad, i have imagined physical pains. i clench my jaw so tightly that it starts to feel like my teeth are falling out, my whole face is on fire and i can’t stop clutching at my jaw and applying pressure desperately trying to relieve it. again, it’s all pretty fucked up. often, the pain doesn’t exist. i have many pain killers to hand, after jumping 45ft to escape a potential murderer and confirmed rapist, and a car crash. i am stacking. i take codeine, naproxen, tramadol. even morphine. the pain is relentless, it doesn’t stop. i take handfuls. it does not stop. but take away whatever is causing anxiety, whether it’s ending an argument or taking valium or being admitted to hospital and replacing the anxiety with something new. it goes. and i’m just left uncomfortably numb. 

i am ashamed to admit, that the physical and the emotional distress causes me to use manipulation tactics to feel better. i avoid it at all costs but just like the rest of it, i really just can’t stop sometimes. if i’m given a window, i will use it. so i begged. he texted me saying he was sad and lost, and when i said i was too, he asked if i wanted to see him. i have asked him to stop texting. i have told him if you give me anything to hang on to, i will use it. he continued to text me. asking where i am, if i got home okay etc. 

i tried. i tried the sensible option of saying no, because it will hurt more when he leaves but i couldn’t stop thinking. there is always hope - for as long as he cares how i feel, there must be. so i asked what i asked about, you know if the window is still open for me and like i said, i was all excited and then it left. i’m not joking, i could feel it leave my body like going from hot to cold in just a second. emotional chilblains. he said not to start thinking in a week it would all be forgotten about and we would be back to normal. 

i switched. i wondered how he would have the audacity to warn me. i thought about every time he has hurt me. i previously said that sometimes i feel the blanket, the reminder of hurt, not what it was specifically that happened. today wasn’t that. today the specific details came back. every time he has ever lied. every time he put his feelings ahead of mine. every time he promised me the world and never delivered. i remembered it all. i remembered feeling it, hearing it. i remember seeing his face as he has to explain why he chose to lie. i could feel my heart racing again, like it did at the time. i could feel the cold. for some reason, in certain anxiety-inducing situations, i find i feel cold rather than hot - like i said before, i can feel the heat leave my body.  i felt that. every time i shut my eyes, this time i could see him and i sitting in my car. i picked i different lie each time and relived each experience like it was happening again. the songs i was listening to. me begging for the truth. sitting side by side, not looking in each others eyes, me driving aimlessly hundreds of miles, begging begging begging. his face, i think about it, i think about the look he gets when he’s been caught out again and god, why did i ever bother? why would i care so much about someone who done so much damage?

now here’s the bit that’s interesting. i felt all of that. he texted me saying he ‘believes that i can be different but needs to see it’ and ‘not to expect us to be back together in a week’ at 12.58. i replied saying i need some resolutions from you too, and that i don’t want things back to normal without change considering he’s hurt me periodically for a year at 13.01. i texted him saying i don’t want him to come round, i am not trying any more, i don’t know why i ever thought i would, told him to stop texting me and fucking with my head etc - i texted this at 13.02. 

in 3-4 minutes, i relived a year of lies. i relived every time he promised he would be there and let me down. every time i cried myself to sleep and he wasn’t there. every time he lost his shit at me without reason. i didn’t just remember it. i relived it. every smell, every taste. like i was there. 

in 4 minutes. in 4 minutes i went from feeling like my life wasn’t worth living without him, and cutting my legs with broken shards of glass, emptying pills into a glass and drinking vodka at 10am, to thinking the only life not worth living, is the one i share with him. in 4 minutes i went from wanting to try anything to save us, to wanting to hear him say he was wrong for how he treated me too - enough that it took over anything else that was important. 

it’s been about 2 hours, and i feel nothing. i feel indifferent. even as i type, he doesn’t cross my mind. i can’t visualise his face, or his voice. i can’t imagine the comfort of his arms around my shoulders and pulling me in. i’m typing it, but i can’t feel it any more. i don’t feel sad, or happy, nor angry. i feel as though i am a passenger. i don’t feel hot or cold. the tv is on, but i can’t concentrate on it. i’ve watched the last episode of behind her eyes 4 times this morning. it’s like i’m phasing in and out of consciousness. 

i feel nothing. and i think one thing, over and over again. am i going crazy? am i wrong for expecting allowances for my behaviour on the basis that not only can i not help it, but unavoidable and extreme trauma towards someone you love should create some sort of shield? that i can have an exceptionally bad day without extreme consequence. like i can snap and he understands and comforts rather than being anger. he used to, and we were so happy. he handled it in such a moving way, so gracious and so strong. he wouldn’t let me walk over him, but had some leniency before retaliation. 

am i crazy? is it wrong to expect that? i never did, but he told me he would make things better for me and to trust him and to date him. i don’t hold any resentment there today, i understand how someone could feel like they can save you when they don’t understand the extent of the damage. on another day, i hate him with every molecule for not listening to me and being so naive. on other days, i love him more, for knowing how hard it would be and still having that faith and wanting to try regardless. 

i was wrong when i said that all my lines are blurred. there is only one today. the line of human decency, the power of love and what to expect from people. i don’t know if i’m wrong to think he could’ve handled it 1000 times better on 1000 different occasions.

i am certain of one thing today. i will not text him. i will not say i was wrong to say i won’t try. i will not apologise. i will, however, shower, and do my hair and put on some make up, and stay awake and sober-ish. just in case he surprises me, comes bursting through my door saying he will try as hard as i want to. just in case. 

day 3. 

today is a hateful day. today is one of the ones where i am a good person, and he is a bad person. today is the opposite of day 1. i guess day 2 was my dissociation period. everything hurts so much today. it’s like how yesterday started, but without the relieving numbness after it. it’s actually the evening of the same day, but it feels like i’ve been in pain for weeks and months, not literally a couple of hours. 

i wrote him a letter. i’m not going to send it, but i couldn’t articulate how i was feeling without addressing him directly. so i will use that letter in place of me talking through my feelings. 

‘one last thing i will say for you to think about. realise that i cannot truly forgive, if i do not understand. i have told you why i can’t bring it (the cheating and other lies) up in a calm way, and i hope that, overall, i’ve created a relationship where you feel comfortable being honest with me and telling me the whole truth, and talking about it long enough that you might understand it better yourself shouldn’t be the most terrifying thing? 

i’ve told you it is what i need. transparency is the most expected thing to want after being cheated on, yet on and off for different reasons you make it seem like it’s such a difficult task for you, or like you’re always fucking it up. it’s not that difficult, and your responses to the times i have something to bring up, increasingly make the situation worse and put me in a position where i don’t feel comfortable any more, so now i’m defensive. we can’t have a conversation about anything real, because from the moment you cunt off, we are just battling against each other being defensive and then apologetic. these times, and absolutely no other times but the times where it seems like you’ve lied or deceived or avoided the truth - if you want things to work, you have to learn to put your feelings to the side to hear what i’m saying before it escalates to something bigger - like me just thinking you’re nasty or you don’t want me because i’m useless and i don’t try or i’m wrong to feel how i feel or i should’ve gotten over it by now. you take away the part of me, that no matter how angry, would always still explain why i feel how i feel, and you would understand better and not feel as angry!! you make me close up. i have never and will never expect you to not react when it’s not directly related to you cheating on me and it being something i’ve told you i need your help to heal from. anything else, react as you want - it won’t go as terribly as you think. 

so that place i create for you, and you might not feel it much any more, but the one where you can tell me anything and i will listen. the times immediately after where i would let you talk and not get mad - they come back if one: you use them to benefit our relationship in some way and two: if you give me those same spaces when i need them, even at the expense of how you feel. i did that for you - i let myself hurt so i could be someone you spoke to about what you done. you were that person for me once. you are not any more. 

you start a conversation with me about it. you tell me how sick you feel at what you done and how you wonder if you could ever forgive yourself. you remind yourself it’s the worst thing you’ve done and to someone that had only ever loved you. and then you talk to me. and i talk back, and i get the answers that i want. ‘it just happened’ isn’t good enough, neither is self sabotage or you were reminded of the way things used to be. i don’t give a fuck if you want to get over it, you get over it with me by helping me. i deserve that from you. i want the loose ends tied, i want specifics. i want you to fucking hear me when i say that your honesty about what happened and why, will never hurt more than every time i am reminded that there is more to this that i am yet to learn. it is a safe place. i want to know. i beg you time and time again. i want you to feel how i feel just for a day, and use it to help us. help me trust you won’t do it again. help me believe your version by telling me how you felt, and not just what you done. i can’t bring this up, because you act like this. you get defensive. you know i still don’t trust you, you know i still struggle most days with what happened - but i need you to be ready, on your terms, and want to talk to me and finally help me heal. 

but you don’t.

i’ve come to realise that when i’m not dealing with the trauma you put me through, i can be an amazing person. i can be kind, considerate, empathetic, loving, loyal, unwavering. increasingly, i am none of those things when i am with you and i don’t want to lose sight of the person i worked hard to be. i will not let you, my dad, my rapist, or anyone else that has caused me years worth of psychological damage be the same people that cause me to lose my character and who i am as a person. you took my trust, and that is all you will take. i will not give you the release of knowing that i caused this by staying with you, as much as you caused it with your actions. 

just know that i have tried. you tell me every time i have an issue with your lack of transparency that you feel i don’t try at all. but i try every day to word things a little kinder, to not act like every issue is the end of our relationship. i try to give you space to explain before i accuse. i try every day by cuddling you to sleep and by waking up with you each morning. i try, when i say i love you even on the days i don’t think you deserve to hear it. i try every time there is someone that has been as loyal to me as i have them, that i let down to spend time reconciling with you. 

i do not deserve to have my feelings ridiculed and put down. you created a victim, so you allow that victim the space they need to heal at your own expense or you walk away. you do not, and unfortunately, for a long time will not have the same right to anger that i have. i recognise that you’re a human being with reactions, regardless of the past - but it is your responsibility to manage those reactions in a way that lets me feel openly about what you done and what you continue to do when you deceive. 

you have put too much attention on trying to make our days perfect and argument-free rather than real. you work on today rather than the future. you live in some sort of fear of being reminded about what you done, and somehow expect me to absorb that, alone, every day. 

you chose to date a girl that had been brutally raped and kidnapped just a couple of months before dating you. whose parents explosive separation caused her to have no contact with either of them. who had been wrestling with loneliness and mental health disorders. i don’t expect you to understand how to manage that without my help - but i expected you to stay faithful. 

you can downplay it as much as you want, and you can say i’m using it as an excuse, but does it really matter? the reality is, you sat in a police interview room with me, as the one person i was allowed to bring with me due to covid-19. you held my hand and cried with me as you watched a monster get sentenced to over 20 years in prison. you heard every second of what i endured that day - what he said to me, what he done to me and sat with me knowing there was more endurance to come. that 3 days before you sat in that room with me, you made a decision to be unfaithful. you heard me say in my witness impact statement that i don’t know how i will ever trust someone again. it’s not an excuse, it is a fact.  

i can’t continue to try while you sit there blaming the victim you helped create.’

what i want to say, or rather scream in his face before melting to the floor, is how dare he? how dare he let me fall in love with him, put me through this and then leave me? he should be begging, not me. he should be the one who feels like they’ve lost someone who made their life great - not me. as i write this, the self resentment is closing in so i can’t really say it with as much conviction as i would’ve done an hour ago. 

maybe we are both just awful. maybe we just weren’t right. maybe i am a little bit crazy, or completely fucked up. maybe he is a bit of a dickhead and maybe he could’ve been better. maybe i’ve been gaslit for months and that has fucked my perception on reality. that’s what my friends say, my colleagues, people that know us both. they say he was wrong to treat me how he did, and i have nothing to feel this crippling self loathing for. maybe i’ve gaslit them into thinking that. 

my head feels like ants. like white noise. like tens of millions of these little dots and lines just vibrating around between my eyes. 

i have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder for 12 years. i have ptsd. i have tried lithium, venlafaxine, sodium volproate, citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, mirtazapine and quetiapine, that i can remember. many more from years ago, but these are the ones most recently. i haven’t found one effective enough to keep me out of hospital and safe. i certainly have not found anything that balances my mood. they are good for different things, some have helped me get to sleep, stay asleep, some have given me a head start on happiness in the mornings, some have turned the buzzing noise down on some of the days. 

i have had talking therapy. mainly for ptsd. i have learned about grounding techniques, but nothing that has helped in my relationship. i have seen 7 different therapists/psychiatrists in the last 14 months. i have been firm in what i need, and that is not trauma focused therapy but dbt. the more recent psychiatrists have agreed, and the ball is rolling, i have my first session with a ‘specialist’ on 20th april and i refuse to stop telling people what i need until i get it. i am grateful to have health professionals on my side, after many years of them working against me. 

dbt is hard to find. not all therapists offer it and it is expensive. you need individual sessions and group sessions to the tune of around £125 a week. it’s made more difficult by being only phone or zoom based now. i know i have slightly different ways of projecting myself based on the medium, so i hope for face to face sessions to resume soon. i have looked into rehabs. i would say that what i experience is not much different to an addiction. rather than taking something i know is bad in the long run, i say something. i guess it’s all to do with feeling a lack of control over my actions. rehab will be my next step. this will cost £3000 for 3 months, with 12 months of follow ups.


thank you everyone that took the time to read this. i am not looking for your opinions on my relationship. i just needed to vent. i thought it may even help someone. maybe someone reading this feels the same buzzing i do, and this might help them recognise it. maybe it’s your partner, and reading this helps you to identify the issues and work with them to get better. it helps me to write, and to try and organise my thoughts and i appreciate that this is insanely wordy, but it’s a relief to type and another relief to post.",ever wondered it’s like relationship someone bpd lot word please save

How to get more Klonopin/similar prescribed? (reason explained&lt;3),"hi guys, the title might be a little off-putting. i didn't really know how what to write.

i'm 22/f and was put on klonopin in around march of 2018 because of a meltdown i had. the treatment center just handed me a prescription. however, in november that year, i overdosed on it due to a traumatic event in a hotel away from home and spent three months in psych hospitals, residentials, etc and was taken off it and replaced with other medications. 

i am currently on:

topiramate

gabapentin

buspar

vistaril

seroquel

i have been going to dbt therapy two times a week for around 8 months. 

i am tired of being on all these medications and still suffering from extreme anxiety and mood swings. klonopin helped me really, really well. but my current psychiatrist would not provide me it with my history of overdosing on it, even though it was not due to addiction and was a one time thing over a year ago.

I tried to stop my meds. Big mistake.,"hey everyone... i am on lithium and seroquel for mood stabilization and they have worked quite well. i’ve started dbt therapy and that is also helping. i’ve been managing a lot better especially since dbt therapy and the use of diary cards. 

i’ve been trying to get off seroquel for a while now with my psychiatrist. they lowered me from 100-300 mg a night to 25-75 mg a night. 

i want off seroquel bc of the weight gain...40lbs that even diet and exercise won’t budge. i made a poor choice on thursday to stop the meds and take lunesta for sleep (prescribed on an earlier attempt to stop) because i told myself, it’s only a sedative at this level, it’s not stabilizing my mood, going off it won’t be a big deal, i just need something to make me sleep.....

wrong. dead wrong. 

72 hours later, wow... my emotions are burning me alive. i’m having to use probably 20 different skills just to keep myself from acting off and causing damage to myself and my relationships. like i’m barely keeping my head above water in this suddenly stormy, choppy sea. it has been terrifying. 

the worst part has been the paranoia. since stopping the meds on thursday, i’ve had the most paranoid thoughts that my fp is going to leave me, cheat on me, is lying to me, is out to get me, is hurting me on purpose...i’ve been aware enough to know that these emotions are coming out of my medication lapse and aren’t reality but it’s been so awful to feel all these irrational, bizarre feelings. i’ve been using dbt skills to function and prevent myself from acting too awful compared to how i would act before. 

the most embarrassing moment for me was when he left my house to drive home for an hour and said he had to call his dad and then he would call me. i had this expectation in my mind of how long the call should take (30-45 minutes) and when the expectation wasn’t met, when it was an hour and ten minutes later (yes, i was watching the clock) and he hadn’t called me, i texted and then i called and then he said, i just got off the phone honey, calm down...and when he called me i broke into tears, asking why he wasn’t talking to me and why was he ignoring me? then i broke into more tears because i was like, wow look at how i am behaving right now this is classic i’m so ashamed. he had to rest before working his night shift at the hospital, and again i had this expectation in my head of when he was supposed to call...(around 5:45 or 6, based on what is typical)... so around that time again i was like texting, are you up yet? will you call me soon? oh, it was so embarrassing. :(

i started the meds back up on sunday night (50 mg) ... and last night i took the full 75 mg and went to bed early too. this morning i took my lithium in the morning when typically i skip my morning dose and take it at night. 

it’s just going to be a rough couple of days before i’m back to center again. i made a mistake. i’ve corrected the mistake. i’m still suffering some consequences. i have realized how important it is not to screw with my meds. if i want off seroquel it has to be done in the right way. this could have been a lot worse than it was, and at least i caught it in time.",1527608829,False,BPD,2018-05-29 15:47:09,"I tried to stop my meds.

Anyone taken quetiapine (seroquel) for BPD?,"i was prescribed a low dose of quetiapine around 3 months ago to treat some of my bpd symptoms (the most troubling being this weird paranoia that i get when anxious) which i was told would also help with my anxiety symptoms and insomnia which is a result of my anxiety. it seemed to work for around a month and a half then i hit a troubling time and ended up pretty manic for s week or two so they agreed to up my dose. another month and a half has passed and my medication seems to be ineffective again all of a sudden. my anxiety has shot up again and i'm being troubled by thoughts that the medication used to slow down, and the sedating effects are no longer present..

i'm due to see my psychiatrist tomorrow for my 3 month review and while i don't feel like my medication is working anymore, i'm terrified to let him know because i don't want to go back to square one with medical professionals telling me that there are no other options for medication (i've tried multiple ssris which have been pretty much ineffective). i'm in the uk and gps and psychiatrists typically seem to be pretty reluctant to prescribe any kind of psychiatric medication if the standard antidepressants don't work so i felt like i'd made a breakthrough in finally being offered an antipsychotic.

i have had some success with cocktailing medicines. the most useful medicines for me are quetiapine (seroquel®), 150 mg and lamotrigine (lamictal®), 200 mg. i have in the past also used diazepam (valium®), 5 mg as a rescue therapy for debilitating anxiety.

New meds gave me the motherlode of side effects,"not the antidepressants tho, it’s the antipsychotics that mess me up. years ago (before i had panic attacks) i was prescribed seroquel for a short time and i remember it making me sleepy. however, in 2018 i was hit by a car and started having terrible panic attack in the middle of the night, the kind of panic attacks that make you feel like you are having a heart attack the first time you have one. i had to go back to therapy and was doing better until 2020. 

with the pandemic i got worse and my psychiatrist tried to put me on topamax. knowing how a panic attack felt like, i stated noticing the symptoms have an hour after taking the pill. told my psychiatrist and i stopped taking them.

What is your experience with antidepressants &amp; BPD?,"i terminated my long-term relationship with my now-ex partner around four months ago, and it's been lonely and excruciating ever since especially since he was my so called “fp” and we’d spend every single day together. i am still going through an awful period of depression and anxiety. i can't seem to get out of my house or operate in any way that would allow me to be more productive. i feel like no matter what i start, i cannot finish or enjoy and i’m constantly filled with sadness, self-hate and everything feels so exhausting. i am also experiencing chronic feelings of emptiness now that he is gone &amp; my friend circle is almost non-existent.  i really want to get back to my old self and become more stable emotionally and start working towards my goals so i’ve decided to go on medication. i’ve never taken medication before so i am totally new to anti-depressants and i am terrified of the side effects. the three types that i’ve looked into so far are: 

1.	quetiapine (seroquel)

just had a bad fight with dad. physical. im out of a house for now. i have some questions for people with bpd.,"i am not diagnosed bpd.  but i have strong reasons for speculations

now questions. 

i feel like nothing is like life. nothing means anything to me. i feel like my father can do whatever he wants and i dont feel anything other than anger.  all i ever feel is anger.  all other emotions are in my head and noth physical with me body 

i took lamictal but it took away my mind. and gave me weird emotions and alot of anxiety 

i dont relate to anyone 
in always thinking about how diffeent everyone is.  

i took quetiapine but it just made me a dickwad. 

ive had xanax. shits addicting.  makes me just stupid drunk without the buzz. and i dont remember anything.  also more anxious with xans 

prozac and ssris always treated me dirty. 

aka

one time i thought god gave me this girl and i had to overdose to get her. luckily i didnt die.and i got the girl.  but dropped her after i got off the prozac and felt the drain of life once again 

second time. couldnt close my eyes without seeing me kill myself. and slit my writst with a fish blade. 

i only feel like life is real or means anything when im high

also im just a dick. but im aware of it. 



on the note of bpd. i have a very powerful abulity to not let most emotions out(except anger). but i do notice i have a tendency to infatuate about a friend/lover then hate them.  this still happened even while on lamictal. 

the degree is so low. and i almost get over the hatred after a while.  so i feel its a stretch. 


ive always enjoyed self harm but i dont do it amymore cuz scars. i could hold a dlame to my arm forever and feel nothing.  i can hold my breathe until i pass out without feeling a pull sometimes.  i just feel nothing ver.

I feel so alone,"i’m in hospital right now.

i’m just out in the smoking area vaping. everyone else is hanging and chatting and getting along but no one wants to talk to me. people won’t sit next to me. i tried to talk to people and they just snapped at me “what now!?”

the care here is horrible. the nurses are rude to patients. my meds have been wrong 4 times in 4 days. other patients meds are wrong just as often. i was crying in pain after the hydro pool chlorine messed with my eyes. it took 18 hours to get eye drops and i just had to knock myself out with all my valium and seroquel. the doctor said he would come back with eye drops but he just didn’t!

i feel like i have nothing. i just for diagnosed with bipolar too and i had terrible akathisia from my antipsychotics so i’m just on lithium now with diaz and seroquel for a prn, but i’m only taking 50mg of seroquel a day because i’m scared of the akathisia. 

this morning i woke up super depressed and the nurses asked if i felt safe and i said no and they didn’t come back to check on me for another hour. i’m trying to get transferred to another hospital but i just have to go through the normal referral process and i have no idea how long that could take. 

i want to do a self-discharge now but i am homeless and have nowhere to go. i don’t want to be here!

i don’t know why nobody wants to talk to me or what i’ve done wrong. everyone else is just as mood-swingy here and will snap at people but then 10 minutes later their best friends. i’ve apologised to everyone i’ve snapped at and i haven’t even been that bad in comparison!

i don’t feel safe or cared for here outside of the short time i see my psychiatrist twice a week. i would have left days ago if it wasn’t for her - but the care for the rest of the day is so terrible i can’t stand it anymore!

i moved here from another state because where i was living was terrible. my psych took me off my 300mg effexor cold turkey and discharged me, and then they wouldn’t let me see him again when everything fell apart because i was “in crisis” and had to go to the public system. the public system is useless in that state - and in this country! i kept calling the cat team asking for help telling them i felt unsafe and i was scared i would have to go to emergency. they finally called me back after three days and when i thanked them for their call they said “well i had to call you back because you threatened to go to emergency if i didn’t!” i bought my plane ticket that evening. 

this hospital was meant to be one of the best in the state but it’s actually a shithole. no one else cares, the other patients just accept that they need to wait 15 minutes for prn and that they have to get their meds corrected most days.

i don’t want to be here! i don’t want to feel so alone! i don’t want to feel like everyone hates me! i don’t want to be that person everyone avoids!

i just want *therapeutic care* to help me get well. i want to not be homeless. i want to not have to keep paying rent for my old house in another state while my “housemate” enjoys the whole house to himself! i’m scared to take my nighttime meds because i’m scared i’ll wake up with suicidal thoughts and i know the nurses can’t do shit because they don’t care. 

when i went to the patient kitchen earlier there was a staff member raising the patient biscuits and she told me she was bored and eating because she’s bored! why isn’t she going around and talking to patients and providing the care that nurses are meant to provide!

why am i all alone? why am i fighting with nurses to get saline to wash my eyes when they’re so irritated i can’t see through the tears streaming down my face?

i just feel so horrible and i don’t want to feel this anymore. it was close to 3 years ago i got my bpd diagnosis and things were meant to get better. i still can’t hold down a job. i have debtors hounding and hounding me but my centrelink payments are all going to rent and to health insurance and i have just spare change leftover.

Confounding Mental Illnesses Or Borderline Personality Disorder?,"hello all,
&amp;nbsp;

i have went to quite a few psychiatrists who misdiagnosed me with borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder type ii. i took the medications (seroquel for bipolar, and lexapro for bpd). of course, it turned out that both medication made me suicidal. i was also once misdiagnosed with adhd and given adderall. it worked well for two days. after that, it made me paranoid and extremely anxious. 

&amp;nbsp;

notice how it made me anxious. usually, a person with adhd would do really well on the medication. so i thought maybe i should go ahead and try strattera and ritalin. nope. you guessed it. same paranoia and anxiety. so it made me think, do i actually have bpd, bipolar disorder, and or adhd? what's causing me to have these symptoms of anger towards those i'm close to and super fidgety behavior in public?

&amp;nbsp;

so after that i bought a dialectical behavior therapy workbook and started therapy. after going through half the entire book, i started noticing that most of the anger and anxiety that i have comes from stress. since 5th grade i developed claustrophobia and certain phobias such as snakes etc. during the beginning of 5th grade i also developed ocd, and it was extremely unpleasant. i would believe that there was a star after me and that i had to shoo it away or it would get the best of me.

&amp;nbsp;

so i took these learnings to my psychiatrist and told her about my past. she told me that i even had slight post traumatic stress disorder since i would get fearful whenever i dealt with situations that evoked the past, such as talking to a loved one, etc. i was finally diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder.

&amp;nbsp;

so what i strongly recommend to each and everyone of you is to notice the effect your medication has on you. if a couple of the same class of medications (such as antidepressants) don't seem to work well on you, you may be misdiagnosed. tell this to your psychiatrist. and also, make you follow up with the same psychiatrists or there could be some confusion buildup, since different psychiatrists give different medication and may think you have some other mental illness since they don't have enough observation from you.

&amp;nbsp;

so what happened in the end for me? i was given klonopin to take as needed and it worked like a charm when my anxiety, panic, and anger came up. notice how i said i take the medication *as needed.* obviously, benzodiazepines are not a good long term treatment but they teach you how to deal with the problems once they come and rewire your way of thinking.

&amp;nbsp;

anyways, i wish y'all the best, and know that you will get better. keep trying and pushing. i believe in you. so you better believe in me too.",1470525655,False,BPD,2016-08-06 23:20:55,"Confounding Mental Illnesses Or Borderline Personality Disorder? hello all,

i have went to quite a few psychiatrists who misdiagnosed me with borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder type ii. i took the medications (seroquel for bipolar, and lexapro for bpd). of course, it turned out that both medication made me suicidal. i was also once misdiagnosed with adhd and given adderall. it worked well for two days. after that, it made me paranoid and extremely anxious. 

&amp;nbsp;

notice how it made me anxious. usually, a person with adhd would do really well on the medication. so i thought maybe i should go ahead and try strattera and ritalin. nope. you guessed it. same paranoia and anxiety. so it made me think, do i actually have bpd, bipolar disorder, and or adhd? what's causing me to have these symptoms of anger towards those i'm close to and super fidgety behavior in public?

&amp;nbsp;

so after that i bought a dialectical behavior therapy workbook and started therapy. after going through half the entire book, i started noticing that most of the anger and anxiety that i have comes from stress. since 5th grade i developed claustrophobia and certain phobias such as snakes etc. during the beginning of 5th grade i also developed ocd, and it was extremely unpleasant. i would believe that there was a star after me and that i had to shoo it away or it would get the best of me.

&amp;nbsp;

so i took these learnings to my psychiatrist and told her about my past. she told me that i even had slight post traumatic stress disorder since i would get fearful whenever i dealt with situations that evoked the past, such as talking to a loved one, etc. i was finally diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder.

&amp;nbsp;

so what i strongly recommend to each and everyone of you is to notice the effect your medication has on you. if a couple of the same class of medications (such as antidepressants) don't seem to work well on you, you may be misdiagnosed. tell this to your psychiatrist. and also, make you follow up with the same psychiatrists or there could be some confusion buildup, since different psychiatrists give different medication and may think you have some other mental illness since they don't have enough observation from you.

&amp;nbsp;

so what happened in the end for me? i was given klonopin to take as needed and it worked like a charm when my anxiety, panic, and anger came up. notice how i said i take the medication *as needed.* obviously, benzodiazepines are not a good long term treatment but they teach you how to deal with the problems once they come and rewire your way of thinking.

BPD During Pregnancy - Does Anyone Have Experience or Suggestions?,"i just found the bpd subreddit and the bipolar subreddit. i stumbled upon them by searching ""manic"" for obvious reasons.

i figured it couldn't hurt to ask. does anyone have experience dealing with bpd, anxiety and/or depression during pregnancy? if so, how did it work out for you, what did you do, and so on?

short backstory: i've had depression and anorexia since i was 10-11 (i'm 23 now) and severe anxiety/agoraphobia since i was 19 or 20. i've been in and out of inpatient, on medication and so on up until i was 22. i finally, finally, got proactive about my treatment. at this time i also got diagnosed with bpd and fibromyalgia. i felt for a long time i had bpd but didn't know for sure.

big family history of mental illness, including mother's suicide when i was 18. that's another reason i'm frantic about handling my mental illness during pregnancy. my mom's logic was killing herself would spare her children from her issues. sadly, i get this logic completely but i don't want to adhere to it by any means.

from october 2013 to october 2014 i was doing great with dbt sessions with an awesome therapist, a stint in inpatient, cymbalta, seroquel and klonopin (on klonopin for years now). i found out i was pregnant and had to go off all of that cold turkey. 

i won't get into the withdrawal because i'm sure you can imagine. i'd say for the most part i'm okay until recently. i'm far enough along now to take wellbutrin and the occasional klonopin. personal life events triggered pretty intense mania and urges i can't shake.

i'm just kind of rambling at this point. basically, i don't want to end up relapsing into self-harm or destroying my relationships. any suggestions for coping would be awesome.

(also, i'm out of town for 3.5 weeks taking care of a relative with severe dementia. so i can't go to therapy weekly.)

Relieved but overwhelmed,"when i was 9 yrs old i was a victim of mother nature and the ef5 tornado she thought i needed to be in. my road to recovery was a long and hard one but that was almost 20 yrs ago. from that i had undiagnosed ptsd until 5 years ago... i was officially diagnosed with mdd (major depressive disorder) and gad (generalized anxiety disorder). last spring i went to see a counselor who specializes in emdr therapy and it was suppose to ""cure"" my ptsd. 
k, so my counselor was a quack. there isn't a cure for ptsd you just learn how to manage it just like any other disorder out there. so when she started creating more problems than fixing them i quit her. 5 months later i went into a panic attack, passed out and gave myself a concussion. that was in october last year, so i called a psychiatrist... my first appointment with her was in november of last year and i absolutely loved her. 

i told her the trauma of my past but for the most part i had a decent childhood. minus the tornado and my family falling apart. i told her that i definitely have bpd traits and bd tendencies... see my mom is undiagnosed with bpd which stemmed from the sexual trauma she endured as a child. naturally, children take on traits from the people they're around most personality. she agreed... wrote me a prescription for effexor for my mdd and that med is truly heaven send, i feel happy again. seroquel to help me sleep and lorazepam on an as needed base. 

december's appointment went well, she upped my dosage to 100mg of seroquel because i still wasnt sleeping through the night. she told mr that she didn't think i was bipolar. she said she was upping the seroquel without the diagnosis of bpd... 

january's visit, symptoms of depression started coming back... suicidal thoughts, lack of motivation and all i wanted to do was sleep. i told her about the turmoil in my relationship. she said symptoms of my depression wouldn't go away until i left my abusive relationship. ap on january 23rd, i left. 

on january 30th, my grandfather passed away and i felt guilty because i didn't grieve and i wasnt depressed. 3 weeks ago i moved out to my dad's. for the last 14 yrs my dad has been a psych nurse and i value and trust his opinions. 
well that weekend 3 weeks ago, he looked at me and asked if i wanted to know what he thought my medical diagnosis was...
i looked at him and said bpd or bd because i cycle like both do... he said bpd. which isn't telling me anything i haven't thought. 

i cycle. my highs are great and my lows are hideous. sometimes i cycle fast and other times its months between cycles... my cycles though, stem from my feelings of being unwanted and unloved... my fear of abandonment which gives a fear of commitment because if i don't commitment i can't be abandoned but i want to commitment. 

i am a bpd and i'm okay with that. it's not my fault that i experienced trauma in my life that this disorder stemmed from. i take a mood stabilizer, an antidepressant and something for my anxiety. besides therapy that my or my not work there really isn't anything i can do but accept what is. i am better working on recognizing my triggers and voicing to my father when i feel i am starting to cycle so he can help me. the fear of abandonment i think will always be there but having people in my life that i know won't abandon me help. the fear of commitment is something i will always struggle with to overcome but i think im getting better at not running away when im scared. 

so with anyone reading this i want to offer as much support as i am asking for. 
you are a good person, it's okay that sometimes you breakdown... you pick yourself back up a stronger person than you were before. just because we have bpd doesn't mean we dont care and it doesn't mean we are selfish.. it means we work twice as hard to be normal. whatever trauma you went through as a child, just know it wasnt your fault. you are a survivor of that and you can survive this!",1523306648,False,BPD,2018-04-09 20:44:08,"Relieved but overwhelmed when i was 9 yrs old i was a victim of mother nature and the ef5 tornado she thought i needed to be in. my road to recovery was a long and hard one but that was almost 20 yrs ago. from that i had undiagnosed ptsd until 5 years ago... i was officially diagnosed with mdd (major depressive disorder) and gad (generalized anxiety disorder). last spring i went to see a counselor who specializes in emdr therapy and it was suppose to ""cure"" my ptsd.

New meds same feeling,"i've been diagnosed with bpd for a little over a year. recently i changed meds before i was on pristiq gabapentin and trazodone but after seeing my psychiatrist he put me on 50mg seroquel once in the morning and once in late afternoon and took me off the gabapentin. he said to help my anxiety so i can socialize more and help the feeling of nothing being real and sort of watching something. also inappropriate outbursts and out if proportion reactions. anyway i also told him i was tired all the time and my muscles hurt too and he said i should go to the doctor. after taking the seroquel for a week now i am even more tired having 1 sometimes 2 naps during then day then sleeping like 10 hours at night, and my body is more sore and stiff especially in the morning. i can't go to school for the full day anymore because my head starts to feel fuzzy and i cant focus at all and feel like i am having an out of body experience so i have to go home and get into bed.

Just got prescribed a 'baby dose' of seroquel (as needed) for anxiety/insomnia - experiences/thoughts?,"have been pretty stable over the last few months, since getting on effexor (150mg). it's taken a chunk out of my anxiety/racing thoughts and really helped pull me out of a dark depression.

but, like others i struggle with having a good, 'clean' sleep pattern without resorting to smoking lots of green, codeine or antihistimines...melatonin was useless for me, personally.

so my psych today prescribed me a small script for seroquel 25mg, to take as needed for sleep. am currently happy weight-wise and am wary as have heard others put on weight. but effexor hasn't had that effect and hoping if i just take it every now and again at small doses (even cut it in half to 12.5mg maybe??) then that weight gain side effect won't be a problem.

i've never taken an anti-psychotic before, will it just make me feel sleepy like a valium? does anyone feel tired the next day off it?

I just hit 7 Year's without self harming,"triggers warning
***************



i haven't cut in 7 years. i feel like i should celebrate that somehow but i also feel like... who cares? 

i was diagnosed with bpd 10 years ago and i honestly don't think i've made much progress in any other ways. or i have, but i just dont see it. 

i was also just diagnosed with adhd so having that diagnoses was life changing for me - alot of the symptoms of bpd and adhd overlap. so i suppose, knowing that there is a way to treat adhd (easier than bpd) is kind of a relief? 

however, the medication i've started on is making me way too anxious. more anxious than i have been in over a year. but it is also making me more productive so i dont know if that is a good thing or not? 

is being more productive more important than feeling anxious? 

or is it better to be not anxious but literally having zero motivation to do anything ever?

why cant i have both? 

i'm on 4 medications. effexor, clonazepam, seroquel and now concerta.

i found the effexor has helped so much more with the anxiety (compared to the celexa i was on for 12 years) 

the seroquel helps me sleep.

the concerta wakes me up so i'm not just laying in bed all fucking day. 

but i'm like... so anxious.... and almost ocd? i want to do these huge tasks (like renovations to my house) and then when i dont follow through i like get super mad and frustrated that the task isnt done. and then i get depressed. 

i'm just starting to lose hope i guess. i've been dealing with this bullshit my entire life and i'm 30 now. and i literally have nothing to show for it.",1565058722,False,BPD,2019-08-06 02:32:02,"I just hit 7 Year's without self harming triggers warning

Medication experiences please!! CW: self harm,"hey everyone :) i know that no one is my psychiatrist or doctor but i have been wondering if anyone’s had some good or bad experiences with medication combinations or anything i can gain some help with.

so i’ve been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety for about 10 years - mostly treated with escitalopram (lexapro) for the majority of that time.
my bpd and c ptsd was diagnosed just over 3 years ago and i was put on quetiapine, starting at 25mg and at my worst 500mg.
in november last year i had a massive medication review with a psychiatrist and tapered off lexapro, and swapped to mirtazapine 15mg. also cutting down to 200mg quetiapine and 2mg melatonin at night. 

throughout all of this i’ve had extensive cbt and dbt as well as trauma therapy.

now, i have broken my leg &amp; had major surgery (that they screwed up) back in november and so i can’t manage my symptoms with exercise or cleaning which were my main (only) coping skills.

i am feeling more unwell than i’ve felt in years, similar to before i was diagnosed. my bpd is out of control, i’ve had multiple attempts on my life.

Can't wake up and then Zombie around.,"was diagnosed with bpd, christmas 2016. 34 yr old female, 3 children, full time professional job. 
always suffered from depression and anxiety since forever and then at christmas had a massive breakdown, put in our psych ward for a few days. i was prescribed seroquel which made me very sleepy while i was in the ward. i don't remember much of it and spent most of my time asleep in my room. 
the seroquel sleepiness seemed to be manageable and i stated to taper off my effexor (which i've wanted to do for so long, hated that med). i'm not 2 months into the seroquel which is 50mg at night and i haven't had any effexor for just over a week.

just recently however i have been having issues waking up in the morning. not just an issue.....simply can't. my fiancee wakes me at 6:30, like he has done forever and i cannot move or talk. my words come out like i'm drunk, i feel like i'm drunk! when i finally can get out of bed, i stumble around with my eyes shut, shower with my eyes shut. i was late to work yesterday and haven't even made it their today. 
my work is very understanding, but i can't keep going this way. 

i've read a fair bit about this happening and some people have suggested 10 hours of sleep! that ain't right. 
others have said they found it helped when they were prescribed a higher dose? 
everyone has a different effect from different doses and when and how they take it. i just wanted to know if anyone else is in this same, just afloat, boat.

p.s. coming off effexor...? damn. the head shakes were uncontrollable, unforgivable and exhausting. two days ago i started taking b12 and fish oil. noticed a difference.",1488319313,False,BPD,2017-02-28 22:01:53,"Can't wake up and then Zombie around. was diagnosed with bpd, christmas 2016. 34 yr old female, 3 children, full time professional job.

• i am a 31-year-old straight female, unemployed, and living with my parents.

• i have a bachelor’s degree (which i’m proud of) but i have a troubling/embarrassing long list of jobs of short intervals. i feel like it’s a sham that i have this framed degree hanging on my wall because i’ve hardly used it, and haven’t been able to repay any of my student loans.

• i have had 1 suicide attempt and long history of self-harm, although i’ve had other vices in recent years (alcohol, pot, and cocaine). i’ve been sober at least since jan. 1st, 2021 so i like that!

• dx: bpd (obviously), major depressive disorder, ptsd, anxiety nos, on/off anorexia

• rx: prozac 60mg, buspar 15mg 3x/day, lithium 300mg 3x/day, seroquel 400mg and minipress 2mg, both @ bedtime, klonopin 0.5mg up to 2x/daily prn

• i have talk therapy weekly (on the phone) and speak to a psychiatrist (also on the phone) every 4 weeks. i used to be in group therapy pre-pandemic and really liked that even though i was hesitant and shy at first.

as i said above, i’ve been seeing things that aren’t there. these might be hallucinations, but i’m unfamiliar in the terminology of exactly what means what.

when i’m in my bedroom with the door open. i can see into another bedroom, with that door also open. a few times i see a black shadow figure move across the room. then i get obsessive and stare into the room waiting for it to happen again so i can get a closer look. i’ve also seen a cat on our couch (we have no cats or dogs) when it was really a floral pillow—looked nothing like a cat.

i can’t tell my parents or my friends this because then they’ll know i’ve really lost it. i’m embarrassed.

i have bpd, severe anxiety/panic disorder, and cylothemia. i started seeing a new psychiatrist and we talks about how i started having mini manic episodes again this year. they last 4-8 days and during that time i don’t sleep, i have way too much energy, paranoia, impulsiveness, racing thoughts, panic, and intrusive thoughts. during my first one in april my regular dr upped my seroquel from 100mg to 150mg and that helped tremendously. however, my psychiatrist would like to try other anti-psychotics because of my terrible weight gain and side effects of seroquel. (i have a very love hate relationship ship with that med. it saved my life but i gained almost 80lbs which the psych said she sees a lot of people with that problem). 
my main question is: has anyone taken vraylar? how did it help? did it make you sleepy? side effects?
i start it on the 1st. we’re not doing any other changes with my other meds yet until we see how this works.

Seroquel / quetiapine and cognitive performance ??,"hi, i'm starting on 25mg seroquel today which will be increased to 50mg after a week or two. i'm in university and very concerned about the antipsychotic's potential to reduce brain mass. having heard it referred to by a tutor as a chemical lobotomy, i'm not super hopeful about retaining my academic performance. 

is anyone else in university and on this medication and if so can you please weigh in? i'm so worried i'm considering just using the drug as and when needed, for instance during breakdowns, rather than daily. thankfully christmas break is in about 3 weeks, so i'll have 3-4 weeks to get used to the dosage.

i won’t do it, but it’s all i think about. inevitably killing myself. sticking around not because i’ve ever been able to have hope that things will be okay, but because my family and bf think i shouldn’t do it. obviously. i know that it only comes off as undermining their ability to decide what does and does not have value in this world, but nothing ever has or ever will convince me that they wouldn’t eventually be much better off after it’s done and over with and they can move on with their lives and see the beauty and wonder that would be there once i’m not a dark cloud in their life. why can’t they just see that? that it’s just a waste of time! someone here said they feel like an npc that only exists to create chaos and destruction in the lives of those around them. it’s so well put. 

it’s not for a lack of trying. ive been institutionalized 11 times for pathetic attempts on my life that never worked, and in rehab 9 times to get off heroin, recover from anorexia, get clean from self harm, and general mental health rehabilitation. it’s been so many times because i only completed three of them and got kicked out of the rest because i’m untreatable. 

i’m off drugs now and a healthy weight with no anorexic or bulimic tendencies anymore. clean from self harm. but none of my body is left untouched and it’s disgusting. i’m disgusting. i couldn’t kick the alcohol but i don’t overdrink anymore, okay sometimes. but not the way i did.

i went off my meds because i wanted to see how i could apply the skills i learned to love the way i’m supposed to without the crutch. i can. but  intense almost fucking romantic desire to kill myself is again a constant in my live. the only constancy out of everything. the only thing i’m intimately familiar with. the only thing i know i can do. i don’t tonos if i am capable of doing string else, but i know that i can do that. i failed it before because i was a coward. the cut was always just short of deep enough. the overdose one mg short of being lethal. i can move past actually doing it, i do that every moment

I’m 17 and already feel like I have been condemned to a life full of mostly pain and debilitating emptiness. I just feel so hopeless and stuck,"using a throwaway account (i dont use reddit often, just browse rarely) but it would be really helpful if anybody who maybe relates to this or felt this way when they were young could help guide me in a direction to help fix myself or just not feel so different.

i’m not a very coherent writer but i guess i could start this by saying that since the beginning of middle school i’ve exhibited and acted out on a lot of behavioral and emotional issues. i’m gay, live in a very accepting typical liberal coastal town  and haven’t dealt much at all with any malice surrounding my sexuality. i’m stating this purely because therapists i’ve met with have always seemed to fixate on me being gay as the root for my problems, and at this point i don’t really know if i refute that or agree. my family knows it and i don’t intentionally hide it from anybody, but i definitely am inclined to automatically dislike/criticize most other gays i know, which probably stems from my own feelings of inadequacy and disconnect from how i see myself versus how i see other guys.

right now feels like the lowest point i have ever reached. although i can say with 100% certainty that i’m not going to kill myself anytime soon, every morning i wake up with the wish that i could cease to exist or more accurately just be in a different body&amp;mind. i have a lot of fear over facing judgement for my emotions and although i can’t fully articulate why that is, i think it has to do with the fact that in my head i am the most disgusting and vile person ever. it feels so attention seeking to even write that out because obviously i know this cannot be objectively true, but the feeling persists. i guess all i can explain it with is that i don’t think i could ever harbor as much hatred for another human being as i do for myself, and i just cannot shake the idea that i am so incredibly different and unloveable.

i’m fully aware that i completely determine my self worth based on how the people i care about think of me. i have a really big problem with my body and my physical appearance, which i personally think i wouldn’t at all experience if i were straight. i could probably deal with this internal conflict if i had a personality that i felt made up for it, but i feel even more trapped within my own head than i do my body. i’ve been straddling the barrier between accepting i have bpd and i don’t deserve the pain i feel, and  thinking like this is just a label given to anybody who seems untreatable and stubborn. prior to this year i always sided with the latter, but deep down i feel like i always knew i had bpd and that i would have to accept it at some point. this seems problematic to me because it has me overthinking that maybe, in some crazy way, i forced this illness upon myself through excessively worrying about it and now i am trapped. 

i know this is most likely just a minor delusion of mine because my parents had me psych tested at 16 since my grades started tanking due to my inability to study or manage a workload at home, so i was convinced i had add and turned towards this diagnosis as an explanation of my heightened emotions, my extreme impulsivity and as to why i had quit literally every single passion/hobby i’d ever picked up. i’m fully aware that in order to have add it needs to be evident throughout your childhood and although i never got bad grades as a kid, all of my other behaviors finally made sense and my parents agreed. though the stuff i read online thoroughly convinced me i was living with debilitating undiagnosed add and every symptom of inattentive type resonated with me, i also read many reports on how the symptoms of bpd, depression, and add tend to manifest in a lot of similar ways to each other so these labels are often misdiagnosed. i got my psych report back and it honestly hurt me so bad to read in writing that i had traits of borderline personality disorder. at that moment i felt so incredibly disappointed in who i was and extremely ashamed and embarrassed of anything to do with myself. i know this is wrong to feel but i can’t help but still tell myself today that i’m inherently inferior to most of the people i’ve met and loved due to these traits. i threw the report out in denial and stopped reading after the first page when i saw that.

the testing was 10 hours scheduled over the course of 5 days and was basically a screen for most psychological disorders, including add and bpd. my testing was technically inconclusive on both, but she noted that i definitely had traits of bpd  although she refused to say that i actually had the disorder. i think she reached this conclusion based on what i shared with her about how i feel extremely different from all my friends and it feels like almost everyone i know is tuned into a collective consciousness that i’m missing out on. i also talked about how my emotional outbursts (depression, anger) affect my family and how difficult it is for me to appear at all vulnerable in the presence of my family. 

i don’t know how much detail i can fit into here but as of today i think i have accepted the fact that i have a lot of these bpd traits. i’ve ghosted people i care about, projected complete idealization onto the boys i’ve dated, and been told i’m manipulating situations with my emotions (i think this only happened once, but it’s stuck with me and i catch myself always questioning myself whether the emotions im expressing are genuine or just manipulation). i have no real self image and sometimes it doesn’t seem like i’m a real person. it’s also very difficult for me to comprehend that not everybody experiences their lives like this, or maybe everybody does and theyre just better at dealing with it than i am? even the friends i have who think they themselves have bpd seem drastically more functional and whole than i am. i think one of the hardest parts about all of this is knowing that nobody sees me how i see myself and this makes me question my own reality. i know that i’m likeable in my school and i know how to appeal to a lot of people, which in turn makes me feel valued. i get uncomfortable in conversations with a lot of people lately and i notice myself somewhat attempt to personality mirror the people i feel that don’t truly know me. i’m also picky with who i give my attention to and i’m very quick to find flaws in people, which i despise because it then makes me feel like i’m a bad person for not wanting to socialize with the majority of people who have tried to befriend me this year.

after 4 months of not taking medication and solely trying a dbt center, i decided my life was stagnant and i should probably find a psychiatrist again. i stopped medication because my psych retired and i got too depressed to put up with side effects and unease that accompanied the meds.

i’m on oxcarbazepine, vyvanse and buspar as of right now. the anticonvulsant was started first and makes me feel like i can’t socialize with anybody and has made me hyper aware of my oddities when in a conversation. i’ve actually asked a few people i know if they had noticed me being weird or different and to my surprise they all answered that i seemed the same. this makes me think that people are either not being honest with me to spare my feelings, or maybe this medication somehow helped me see myself for who i truly am and notice all these uncomfortable things about myself that i had never worried about before, i was first placed on ritalin to see if it would improve my schoolwork and attention and that turned me into an extremely anxious mess without assisting my focus at all. vyvanse causes me to not eat and seemed to have triggered my insomniac behaviors (i had gone off the low dose of seroquel i was prescribed as a sleep aid and was sleeping fairly well prior to this), but it has helped me a lot in my ability to study and get schoolwork done.

it pains me so much that my life could be amazing but the only thing holding me back are the traits that make up my personality. i can’t stress enough that this is who i feel i am and i’m so ashamed of myself. i recognize every single problem within myself yet it seems so overwhelming and beyond myself to have the ability to take control of my life. i truly feel broken and none of my friends my age seem to understand what it feels like to not even know who you are. i feel like i’m living a lie and i don’t understand how so many people at school can make the effort to show me they enjoy my presence yet i still feel this suffocating self loathing considering i think my hatred comes from the idea that i’m not good enough for anyone.

i don’t know where this is even going anymore but basically i have been struggling so hard these past few months and lately have been feeling so desperately hopeless in terms of my future. it feels like i’m destined to be a drug addict or kill myself and i hate that those thoughts can’t leave my head. last year i was expelled from my school for having weed on campus (definitely did not deserve this punishment considering i did not sell to anyone or even use myself. i just had it in my bag). i was accused of being a drug dealer and it didn’t help that i was obsessed with portraying an image of myself as a stoner who could hang in attempts to create a sort of personality for myself and feel like i was fun to be around. prior to being expelled i was a lot happier and felt like i was connected to so many people. i had such a better outlook on life and despite being expelled, i worked my ass off continuing the rest of the year online and got all a’s in my honors classes. now i feel like i’m so alone and nobody truly knows me. i feel like there’s zero point in trying to better myself as a person because i have the unshakeable idea that this is who i am as a person and there is no way to be the healthy, happy person i want to be. i know this was super long and wordy for no reason but i don’t think i’ve ever actually written out how i feel about my possible borderline personality disorder. it is one of my biggest insecurities and i’d be helpful if anyone could share how they deal with it esp at a young age when you don’t even know who you are yet.",1558742838,False,BPD,2019-05-25 00:07:18,"I’m 17 and already feel like I have been condemned to a life full of mostly pain and debilitating emptiness.

right now feels like the lowest point i have ever reached. although i can say with 100% certainty that i’m not going to kill myself anytime soon, every morning i wake up with the wish that i could cease to exist or more accurately just be in a different body&amp;mind. i have a lot of fear over facing judgement for my emotions and although i can’t fully articulate why that is, i think it has to do with the fact that in my head i am the most disgusting and vile person ever. it feels so attention seeking to even write that out because obviously i know this cannot be objectively true, but the feeling persists. i guess all i can explain it with is that i don’t think i could ever harbor as much hatred for another human being as i do for myself, and i just cannot shake the idea that i am so incredibly different and unloveable.

i’m fully aware that i completely determine my self worth based on how the people i care about think of me. i have a really big problem with my body and my physical appearance, which i personally think i wouldn’t at all experience if i were straight. i could probably deal with this internal conflict if i had a personality that i felt made up for it, but i feel even more trapped within my own head than i do my body. i’ve been straddling the barrier between accepting i have bpd and i don’t deserve the pain i feel, and  thinking like this is just a label given to anybody who seems untreatable and stubborn. prior to this year i always sided with the latter, but deep down i feel like i always knew i had bpd and that i would have to accept it at some point. this seems problematic to me because it has me overthinking that maybe, in some crazy way, i forced this illness upon myself through excessively worrying about it and now i am trapped. 

i know this is most likely just a minor delusion of mine because my parents had me psych tested at 16 since my grades started tanking due to my inability to study or manage a workload at home, so i was convinced i had add and turned towards this diagnosis as an explanation of my heightened emotions, my extreme impulsivity and as to why i had quit literally every single passion/hobby i’d ever picked up. i’m fully aware that in order to have add it needs to be evident throughout your childhood and although i never got bad grades as a kid, all of my other behaviors finally made sense and my parents agreed. though the stuff i read online thoroughly convinced me i was living with debilitating undiagnosed add and every symptom of inattentive type resonated with me, i also read many reports on how the symptoms of bpd, depression, and add tend to manifest in a lot of similar ways to each other so these labels are often misdiagnosed. i got my psych report back and it honestly hurt me so bad to read in writing that i had traits of borderline personality disorder. at that moment i felt so incredibly disappointed in who i was and extremely ashamed and embarrassed of anything to do with myself. i know this is wrong to feel but i can’t help but still tell myself today that i’m inherently inferior to most of the people i’ve met and loved due to these traits. i threw the report out in denial and stopped reading after the first page when i saw that.

the testing was 10 hours scheduled over the course of 5 days and was basically a screen for most psychological disorders, including add and bpd. my testing was technically inconclusive on both, but she noted that i definitely had traits of bpd  although she refused to say that i actually had the disorder. i think she reached this conclusion based on what i shared with her about how i feel extremely different from all my friends and it feels like almost everyone i know is tuned into a collective consciousness that i’m missing out on. i also talked about how my emotional outbursts (depression, anger) affect my family and how difficult it is for me to appear at all vulnerable in the presence of my family. 

i don’t know how much detail i can fit into here but as of today i think i have accepted the fact that i have a lot of these bpd traits. i’ve ghosted people i care about, projected complete idealization onto the boys i’ve dated, and been told i’m manipulating situations with my emotions (i think this only happened once, but it’s stuck with me and i catch myself always questioning myself whether the emotions im expressing are genuine or just manipulation). i have no real self image and sometimes it doesn’t seem like i’m a real person. it’s also very difficult for me to comprehend that not everybody experiences their lives like this, or maybe everybody does and theyre just better at dealing with it than i am? even the friends i have who think they themselves have bpd seem drastically more functional and whole than i am. i think one of the hardest parts about all of this is knowing that nobody sees me how i see myself and this makes me question my own reality. i know that i’m likeable in my school and i know how to appeal to a lot of people, which in turn makes me feel valued. i get uncomfortable in conversations with a lot of people lately and i notice myself somewhat attempt to personality mirror the people i feel that don’t truly know me. i’m also picky with who i give my attention to and i’m very quick to find flaws in people, which i despise because it then makes me feel like i’m a bad person for not wanting to socialize with the majority of people who have tried to befriend me this year.

after 4 months of not taking medication and solely trying a dbt center, i decided my life was stagnant and i should probably find a psychiatrist again. i stopped medication because my psych retired and i got too depressed to put up with side effects and unease that accompanied the meds.

i’m on oxcarbazepine, vyvanse and buspar as of right now. the anticonvulsant was started first and makes me feel like i can’t socialize with anybody and has made me hyper aware of my oddities when in a conversation. i’ve actually asked a few people i know if they had noticed me being weird or different and to my surprise they all answered that i seemed the same. this makes me think that people are either not being honest with me to spare my feelings, or maybe this medication somehow helped me see myself for who i truly am and notice all these uncomfortable things about myself that i had never worried about before, i was first placed on ritalin to see if it would improve my schoolwork and attention and that turned me into an extremely anxious mess without assisting my focus at all. vyvanse causes me to not eat and seemed to have triggered my insomniac behaviors (i had gone off the low dose of seroquel i was prescribed as a sleep aid and was sleeping fairly well prior to this), but it has helped me a lot in my ability to study and get schoolwork done.

it pains me so much that my life could be amazing but the only thing holding me back are the traits that make up my personality. i can’t stress enough that this is who i feel i am and i’m so ashamed of myself. i recognize every single problem within myself yet it seems so overwhelming and beyond myself to have the ability to take control of my life. i truly feel broken and none of my friends my age seem to understand what it feels like to not even know who you are. i feel like i’m living a lie and i don’t understand how so many people at school can make the effort to show me they enjoy my presence yet i still feel this suffocating self loathing considering i think my hatred comes from the idea that i’m not good enough for anyone.

i don’t know where this is even going anymore but basically i have been struggling so hard these past few months and lately have been feeling so desperately hopeless in terms of my future. it feels like i’m destined to be a drug addict or kill myself and i hate that those thoughts can’t leave my head. last year i was expelled from my school for having weed on campus (definitely did not deserve this punishment considering i did not sell to anyone or even use myself. i just had it in my bag). i was accused of being a drug dealer and it didn’t help that i was obsessed with portraying an image of myself as a stoner who could hang in attempts to create a sort of personality for myself and feel like i was fun to be around. prior to being expelled i was a lot happier and felt like i was connected to so many people. i had such a better outlook on life and despite being expelled, i worked my ass off continuing the rest of the year online and got all a’s in my honors classes. now i feel like i’m so alone and nobody truly knows me. i feel like there’s zero point in trying to better myself as a person because i have the unshakeable idea that this is who i am as a person and there is no way to be the healthy, happy person i want to be. i know this was super long and wordy for no reason but i don’t think i’ve ever actually written out how i feel about my possible borderline personality disorder. it is one of my biggest insecurities and i’d be helpful if anyone could share how they deal with it esp at a young age when you don’t even know who you are yet.",i’m 17 already

Taking Seroquel for BPD?,"i'll start by saying i am female aged 32.

today my doctor (not my family doctor but the one at my local university) perscribed me seroquel, however looking it up there seems to be more negative than good. my doctor told me only to take it when i have those moments where i feel low, sad, paranoid, scared and to take how much i need to feel better (25mg tablets), the perscription itself contradicts what he said and it says to take one pill daily for two weeks.

i don't want to be a over eating zombie where my symptoms could be potentially worse and could effect my university studies. i have never taken a medication in my life for my personality. i once took adderall for my fear of flying, but it never did anything - and people don't believe me. i've gone as far as popping 3 of those bad boys and nothing.

i should mention i have not been formally diagnosed with bpd, it has been suggested and we are still waiting for psych evaluation but there just happens to be such a huge wait in my home town so going through the university has so far the quickest method. through all this all i have been focused on is the proper type of therapy that could be good for me. i have heard wonderful things about dialectical behavior therapy but i need a referral for medical to cover it - just today we signed me up for a session that begins at the university next month!

since i've never been the type to take medications and of course i can self medicate. when i feel over the top anxious or nervous i would rather walk to my fridge and have a couple beers. my self awareness has always made me never over indulge in anything - even though i drink almost every second day a couple of beers, i very rarely get ""wasted"". i don't really like being drunk followed by being dizzy when i try to fall asleep and worse is the horrible hang over that can lead to me feeling bummed later the next day. i also never mentioned to my doctor that most my psychosis and paranoid episodes happen when i smoke weed - even though the episodes are rare and until my last one, a month ago, i was already feeling nervous - mostly just nervous about the boredom i was about to expect from christmas break. however i still get super down, followed by being eagerly excited until i throw up. i can get really annoyed too and lash out in anger. my moods shift so fast through out the day and i have a serious problem with favoritism - mostly with boyfriends. 

i have done a share of recreational drugs while having some fun times but never as an addict (coke, mdma, acid, mushrooms) and wonder if any of these have trigged this frame of mine to this point - my last psychotic (and biggest, last month) episode was after i did mdma and had a random hook up with a guy i had been flirting with. the fact that i sort of wasn't ready for it and him disappearing right after made me feel like crap and unworthy of any love from anyone - i don't usually hook up because i know how crappy i feel when it lacks emotion.

even though i don't think my symptoms are as extreme as others i have met. i suffer from extreme boredom and can fluctuate from loneliness. i do not cause self harm. however i do get suicidal thoughts and have tried many times over my life - not to end my life but to stop the emotional pain. i used to bang my head on the wall as a teen. i do have insane emotionally unstable relationships that is most likely related to abandonment issues - foster care as a child and eventually taken back to my mother when i was about 8, and now most of these issues are surfacing. my last relationship basically went as ""this isn't working, just leave.."" when he was telling me i was his world and when he finally gave up and caved and agreed with me i instantly did a mental switch and ""no! please dont go!"". however he caused a lot of pain on me - he cheated and then kept in contact with her and when we both agreed we thought i was moving away (i went to a different university 5 hours away) i moved back to be closer to him and then he left his fuck list out which had several names after mine - in which not only did i not realize it was one girl, it was more and their names were all listed for me to see. my only tip off to anything even going on was when a random girl tried to add me on social media. anyway that is neither here nor there - but doesn't help my issues these days because i painfully miss him and we broke up in early august.

anyway, i feel really really nervous about taking this stuff and really do not want to. i called my mom crying about it and she agrees that this is my body and i should put what i want into it. however.. at the same time even as simple as this perscription as set my nervous mood over the edge today and i'm shaking as i type this. i know there is something wrong with my mind at times... and i know i can wake up tomorrow feeling better (depending if i have nice dreams).. but for now i just don't think i trust it.

what have your experiences been like? why wouldn't my doctor just perscribe something like valium when i have overly emotional moments? i've never tried valium but i feel like that would be better for a quick fix in a moment than this.",1483677630,False,BPD,2017-01-06 04:40:30,"Taking Seroquel for BPD? i'll start by saying i am female aged 32.

"Looking for similar experience and successful advice for love, career, and more","hi all,
(tl;dr below)
i am a male and only been diagnosed bpd since 2 years at the age of 29 because of severe self-mutilation habit and hospitalization. probably had this since +- 20 years.

i search similar experience on how to handle particular situation and if people generally feel the same.

at the start of high school i was bullied, to one point where i lost my shit and hurt my only friend, which lead to not having any friend for the entire high school duration. so i realize i made one mistake and that's it, no more friend?
then became extremely afraid of all relation because i would constantly rethink every single thing that had happened to make sure i did no mistake, constantly worrying about making one and always stressed that i would say or do something inappropriate. make me feel like it's unfair i got such an heavy punishment for one mistake. until then i would avoid every social event and be scared of just hanging out because people find me boring but it's because i am afraid of doing or saying thing.

so anyway, on another level, i was always extremely scared of love relations from as far as i can remember, the first 10 years i put that all aside thinking i can live without it. from as far as i remember i am gay, and even tho i do not live in a explicitly gay-bashing family, hearing thing like: from father side: ""hope you are not a fucking fag, fucking disgusting, well i would still love you"" and ""your controller won't suck your fucking dick go outside and do something for fuck sake"" after telling my dad to look at what i did in a game (the first and last time i would do that). from mother side it's more like comment when listening tv where gay subject would come and see her negative reaction. you can say anything to your kid after but if you contradict everything later in your action that's worth nothing.

so because of all that i am still a virgin at 31 year old, still extremely afraid, never even had a kiss, far from ever having a relation. this is what triggered the worse in me 3 years ago. i went back to college mostly to catch up on that. were not able to and instead started to having very destructive behavior like cutting/hitting/drugging myself and doing careless actions. after a suicide attempt i talked to a doctor who prescribed me quetiapine and venlafaxine.

those 2 thing helped me but quetiapine mad me gain 150 pounds and a shit tons of health problem (severe sleep apnea (88 osa), thyroid disfunction, blood pressure etc...). at least i was out of all that but if i knew it would had such bad effect on me i would have opted for only venlafaxine and other thing like that.

now i stopped taking quetiapine for now 6 month but i have trouble loosing that weight, i have a cpap machine for my sleep apnea so at least i have energy (i was sleeping 16 hour a day before i had this and still feel like i was going to fall at any moment).

turn out the course i did actually led me to a good career possibility. but i am currently still in evaluation and was thinking of what i'd do if that doesn't work. it's the only very positive event that had happened to me since very long and i feel like i don't have anything more to go with. i feel like loosing that job for any reason would be for me the last straw after 20 years of suffering. i am really worrying sick because i have no friend, no love, no money and if that fails i know i won't have anything to hang on to continue.

what would nourish self-harm behavior in the past were the fact that i had no reason to not do it, could though of all i want and talk to who i wanted, suicide-line or therapy but none of those gave me what i wanted: a stable life with someone i love and love me back. i know only me can get that but i am still stuck and now i'm afraid it's very late and missed most opportunities. people told me i should work on myself, become someone i would date and blablabla, but i was someone like that 3 years ago and it didn't worked, now i'm fat, covered with huge scars, even more afraid and parano... that's why i don't like those kind of advice. someone have a similar experience with different advice?

right now i have good chance of having the job but this morning i messed up. i don't think it should that dramatic but could play in my disfavor. it seemed that my references given to the hr were not serious looking at all and had grammar mistake in them. (looked good and professional to me but i never done this in the past) i feel like that would be a very very overkill punishment for again, a small fucking mistake.

tl;dr: read last paragraph should be good, apart from first question.",1498662768,False,BPD,2017-06-28 15:12:48,"Looking for similar experience and successful advice for love, career, and more hi all,
(tl;dr below)
i am a male and only been diagnosed bpd since 2 years at the age of 29 because of severe self-mutilation habit and hospitalization. probably had this since +- 20 years.

i search similar experience on how to handle particular situation and if people generally feel the same.

at the start of high school i was bullied, to one point where i lost my shit and hurt my only friend, which lead to not having any friend for the entire high school duration. so i realize i made one mistake and that's it, no more friend?
then became extremely afraid of all relation because i would constantly rethink every single thing that had happened to make sure i did no mistake, constantly worrying about making one and always stressed that i would say or do something inappropriate. make me feel like it's unfair i got such an heavy punishment for one mistake. until then i would avoid every social event and be scared of just hanging out because people find me boring but it's because i am afraid of doing or saying thing.

so anyway, on another level, i was always extremely scared of love relations from as far as i can remember, the first 10 years i put that all aside thinking i can live without it. from as far as i remember i am gay, and even tho i do not live in a explicitly gay-bashing family, hearing thing like: from father side: ""hope you are not a fucking fag, fucking disgusting, well i would still love you"" and ""your controller won't suck your fucking dick go outside and do something for fuck sake"" after telling my dad to look at what i did in a game (the first and last time i would do that). from mother side it's more like comment when listening tv where gay subject would come and see her negative reaction. you can say anything to your kid after but if you contradict everything later in your action that's worth nothing.

so because of all that i am still a virgin at 31 year old, still extremely afraid, never even had a kiss, far from ever having a relation. this is what triggered the worse in me 3 years ago. i went back to college mostly to catch up on that. were not able to and instead started to having very destructive behavior like cutting/hitting/drugging myself and doing careless actions. after a suicide attempt i talked to a doctor who prescribed me quetiapine and venlafaxine.

Appropriate medication + DBT worked!! I'm getting better!!,"a month or two ago, i posted about [how i was highly abusive and literally ruined my relationship](https://www.reddit.com/r/bpd/comments/livdu5/literally_ruined_my_relationship_because_im/). i was being physically and verbally abusive with my partner and couldn't even make it through a 24 hour period without having some kind of meltdown. i checked into a psychiatric hospital and it did nothing for me. it was rock bottom.

finally, after months of trying every medication under the sun, i started seroquel. it worked so well! the *day* i started seroquel i was having 50% fewer episodes, and the episodes i did have were 50% as long. i started to feel peace and stability during my day. i started at 25mg and am now on 50mg. if you're afraid of antipsychotics, don't be! i have practically no side effects. it even helps me sleep. it was a lifesaver.

the good news doesn't end there. i also started a dbt program with an individual dbt specialist (1hr a week) and a dbt skills group put on by my local lgbtq center (1.5 hr a week). the skills i'm learning are **changing my life**. i now have less than one episode a week, and each episode is less than 2 hours, and i *never* do anything abusive during them anymore. it's been weeks since i last felt suicidal or felt like hurting myself, weeks since i've done anything abusive, and i'm feeling positively *happy* most days. yes, my partner and i still end up yelling at each other every sunday over cleaning the house, but that's nothing compared to how it used to be.

dbt programs are a year long and i'm only one month in. i know most of the journey still lies ahead of me. but i'm 1000% better than i was two months ago.

i wanted to make this post to tell people that it can get better. if i, *an abuser*, can improve, you can too. **don't give up.**

the two keys to finally turning things around:

1. trying medication after medication without giving up until you find one that works for you.
2. trying therapist after therapist and program after program until you find one who's good for you.

i know from experience how hard it is to find those things. i was in the er for drug-induced complications three times from previous medications i was trying. i tried 5 therapists, 3 group therapy programs, 2 psychiatric nurse practitioners, and 1 inpatient hospital stay before finding a program that actually helped me. i had no insurance, expensive self-paid insurance, and finally state insurance.

getting here took fucking ages. it took a hideous amount of money and time. it was painful and miserable and i thought several times about giving up. i'm so glad i didn't**.**

Question about Quetiapine &amp; does anyone take it ? If so what are your experiences/reactions etc?,"so a little bit of a backstory of me, i have bpd &amp; have had it for years (diagnosed approx 6 years ago now). i’ve never been successful with the medication prescribed for me. i’m pretty sensitive to side effects of medications and seemingly most times the side effects have been way more negative than the reward and i’ve eventually ended up coming off them and stopping medication altogether.

recently i went through something pretty traumatic to add on top of all the other traumatic things, and i’ve basically been experiencing high levels of mania, delusions and pretty intense mood swings daily, in reaction i suppose. 

my doctor went and prescribed me 25mg of quetiapine which i understand is a low moderate dose, i was on 250mg of insomnia inducing sertraline last year.

i’m a pretty big researcher / googler especially with pills and having reactions etc ( i got a itchy skin rash across my body from citalopram ). i did my research and it says for quetiapine, the big red bold main side effects are weight gain and increased appetite. my issues with this, like most other people with bpd, is that i’ve struggled with ed behaviours all through my life. 

after the most recent traumatic thing happened, i gained quite a bit of my weight as my bed/ starving kicked into full steam ahead and i’ve only just very recently managed to get this under control. 

has anyone taking this, experienced the rapid weight gain ? after working really hard to get my binge eating stuff manageable, i’m really afraid of taking this for it to escalate my ed again. 

(my doctor being the absolute *insert mean word for doctors here*, didn’t even explain to me about the side effects, look at my file at all, i mean the dude reduced my 10 min appointment to a 3 min one by telling me my emotions weren’t real and that everything i felt was my illness, real rad doctor he is 🙂) 

side note; i’ve only ever found cbd oil to work for me, however at like £50 for a 30ml bottle, i can no longer afford to buy it with not being able to work in so long.

Thinking of overdosing/abusing medication every night,"i have old pills saved in my drawer from trying different medications and i keep thinking of overdosing on them. i'm not actually suicidal but i can't get the thought out of my head. i'm just very curious of what would happen if i took them all. i've got quetiapine, fluoxetine and venlafaxin. i've heard quetiapine is quite overdose-safe but i wanna see what would happen if i took like a very high dosage... fluoxetine fucked me up bad so i wonder what would happen if i took a lot of it.
 
i've sent messages to all three of my therapy contacts but i'm assuming they're on vacation because they haven't replied. i rationally know i should call the therapy place and ask for someone who can fill in for my regular contacts but lol fuck that. i don't care what i might do.

How long did it take to get an accurate BPD diagnosis? How many times were you misdiagnosed? I'm feeling discouraged.,"back story: about 10 years ago i was diagnosed with bipolar 2. got on lamictal and it drastically improved my depression. however, it did not do anything for my supposed hypomanic episodes. i was told lamictal doesn't treat the hypomanic part of bipolar 2 and it only treats the depression part. this started the journey of medication after medication combination that never seemed to do anything as my life continued to fall apart. all of my relationships have failed mainly because of my suspicions/paranoia, jealousy, accusations, and the hurtful words and actions that quickly followed. that and my irresponsible and destructive behavior. my last resort was lithium which is a medication i refused to try until i had exhausted all other options. when i got on lithium, i became extremely suicidal. so, i was put on seroquel in addition to it to balance everything out. i no longer felt as suicidal, but the side effects were terrible. i lost what little motivation i had to do anything. i didn't laugh anymore. i didn't cry. my memory was almost non existent. the only thing i gained from those medications was weight. i still had my outbursts, jealousy, suspicions, hurtful actions, destructive behavior, all the same shit. finally, i was done with it. last march, i began the process of weaning off of the meds. i've been off of them now for about 6-7 months. 

here we are now: i've always felt like i either didn't have bipolar 2 or that i had something else going on too. nothing made sense and i got so very hopeless. one day my girlfriend sent me a link about the negative ideas that people have about bpd and how misunderstood the disorder is. then it gave insight and information about the disorder and how to treat it. the reason she sent this to me is because she thought that bpd stood for bipolar disorder, which made me think so as well because i really didn't know what bpd was. as i'm reading this, i'm thinking.. that doesn't really sound like what i've heard bipolar disorder described as, but that sure as hell fits exactly what i've gone through for as long as i can remember. that is when i discovered what bpd is. since then i have watched every video available, read books and done all the research i possibly can on this disorder. i finally made an appointment with a psychologist, and i went to that appointment earlier today. 
he did his initial evaluation and at the end of the session, he told me that at this point he would diagnose me with bipolar 2, anxiety disorder, and gambling disorder. i was very upset and asked him if he felt like i didn't meet the criteria for bpd. he said he doesn't feel like i do, but if i would like, we can explore that during our next session. i am extremely upset by this and i'm wondering if it takes multiple sessions for the doctor to realize what is going on and give an accurate diagnosis? do i even bother going back to this psychologist? do i trust what he's saying and let go of the idea of what i think is going on? has anyone else experienced this before? am i losing my absolute mind???

Codependent “cyclothymic/bipolar spectrum” individual with questions for those of you affected with Borderline Personality Disorder,"disclaimer: im not seeking a diagnosis from any of you. (i would only leave such claims to medical “professionals”). im looking for trends amongst this community’s illness that may be prominent in my dysfunctional lifestyle so that i can seek more effective help for once in my life. i need professional help. any of your input is greatly appreciated, thank you for taking the time to read my post.

hello. i’ve been treated for bipolar spectrum illness for almost 3 years. ive been suicidal since i was 12. i’m 18. 

i feel like i’ve been misdiagnosed for the reason that i have extremely codependent tendencies. dangerously on and off in my relationship, anger and love in constant battle that destroys my life. literally feeling like dying without her. then wanting to never see her again. taking sleeping pills when she wont talk to me. blocking her when she triggers me.

in my research behind codependent relationships (online lectures and books by psychotherapists specializing in codependent relationships) i have found that an individual with any type of personality disorder is usually a key ingredient for a codependent relationship. a dysfunctional person, one who denies being ill and refuses treatment (me).

my parents dont force me to have a pdoc/therapist because one is absentee and the other is sort-of easy to fool. i prefer to hide my problems because theres so much social stigma around being a mentally dysfunctional male.

i’ve been hospitalized for suicide
had drug and alcohol problems
major depressive episodes
cyclothymic hypomania (never full mania)
been on paxil, seroquel, lamictal, xanax, zoloft (prescription) 
i no longer take medication because i would abuse it to try to hurt myself, and i had a lot of nightmarish side effects. i also believe that my old psychiatrist was over medicating me which has made me distrustful of psychiatrists and medication. this psychiatrist (one ever saw him) was retiring and didnt care about me, i dont know why i went to him. i was too young to understand what a good psychiatrist was like. i use extensive exercise and bad coping mechanisms to calm myself down when needed.

my question is, do you find any similarity between your problems in mine. were any of you called manic-depressed before you were called bpd? is codependency something that most of you struggle with?

what do you do to cope? meditation, exercise, psychiatric medication?

seriously, any input is really appreciated. i need the help of a therapist and i need to stop lying to myself about being normal. i need to stop denying treatment. again, thank you for taking the time to read my post. it means a lot to me, to hear from people who know first-hand what it is like to have bpd.",1518655342,False,BPD,2018-02-15 00:42:22,"Codependent “cyclothymic/bipolar spectrum” individual with questions for those of you affected with Borderline Personality Disorder disclaimer: im not seeking a diagnosis from any of you.

I'm not sure whether to start taking seroquel again.

so i'm asking you guys if anyone has had any positive experiences with seroquel. is there a way to still build muscle and burn fat on this drug? is there a way to combat the chronic fatigue?

SEROQUEL ANYONE?,"this is by far the best medication i've taken for mood swings, anxiety, depression, and bpd. way better than lamictal that didn't do shit, amd way better than ambilify or klonopin as well. i take it alongside adderall xr, and prosozin for nightmares. best med combination that i've ever been on. it was alot of trial and error to find the right med combo but glad i did. i have experienced zero weight gain from it (guess i'm lucky) but i also watch what i eat and pound down fruits and vegetables every single day, and have been for over 2 years now. i am able to handle stressful situations now without the need for a benzo, i am not overthinking anymore, i analyze things much more efficiently. things that used to bother me really don't anymore. i feel more confident, and put together. overall my total functionality has drastically improved. i know it's hard to take antipsychotics, but it has changed my life. you will also sleep like a baby on this stuff. be ready for crazy dreams. with bpd we all deal with impulsiveness, but this med will knock that out of the park. i highly recommend this med if you have bpd. hope everyone has a good day. let me know your thoughts and experiences. mine was positive, but no 2 people react to medications the same. ✌🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑",1620921039,False,BPD,2021-05-13 15:50:39,"SEROQUEL ANYONE? this is by far the best medication i've taken for mood swings, anxiety, depression, and bpd. way better than lamictal that didn't do shit, amd way better than ambilify or klonopin as well. i take it alongside adderall xr, and prosozin for nightmares. best med combination that i've ever been on. it was alot of trial and error to find the right med combo but glad i did. i have experienced zero weight gain from it (guess i'm lucky) but i also watch what i eat and pound down fruits and vegetables every single day, and have been for over 2 years now. i am able to handle stressful situations now without the need for a benzo, i am not overthinking anymore, i analyze things much more efficiently. things that used to bother me really don't anymore. i feel more confident, and put together. overall my total functionality has drastically improved. i know it's hard to take antipsychotics, but it has changed my life. you will also sleep like a baby on this stuff. be ready for crazy dreams. with bpd we all deal with impulsiveness, but this med will knock that out of the park. i highly recommend this med if you have bpd. hope everyone has a good day. let me know your thoughts and experiences. mine was positive, but no 2 people react to medications the same. ✌🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑",seroquel anyone far best medication ive taken mood swing anxiety depression bpd way better lamictal didnt shit amd way better ambilify klonopin well take alongside adderall xr prosozin nightmare best med combination ive ever alot trial error find right med combo glad experienced zero weight gain guess im lucky also watch eat pound fruit vegetable every single day 2 year able handle stressful situation without need benzo overthinking anymore analyze thing much efficiently thing used bother really dont anymore feel confident put together overall total functionality drastically improved know hard take antipsychotic changed life also sleep like baby stuff ready crazy dream bpd deal impulsiveness med knock park highly recommend med bpd hope everyone good day let know thought experience mine positive 2 people react medication ✌🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑,0.9434085024548172,"['Amphetamine', 'Clonazepam', 'Lamotrigine', 'Quetiapine']","```json

Med review and slow release seroquel suucks.,"so i had a lovely breakdown on sunday night and by monday i was in the ed waiting to be seen by a doctor for some emergency meds. i waited 8+ hours only to have the guy want to up me seroquel dose. i'm only on 50 mg but that's enough to knock me way out so i have it at night. 

so we debated for about 20 mins regarding benzos and the type of release,he was such a lovely guy and did all the right things by not just chucking a permanent med in to stabilise my mood, we ended up agreeing on slow release seroquel so i am less of a risk to everyone around me any myself. well hot doggity damn, it sucks!!

difference between bipolar and bpd,"i was diagnosed with bipolar ii over 7 years ago. tbh it hasn't been very well treated despite heavy use of all the meds. i've had many prolonged depressive episodes and not much hypomania at all. 

even when i'm not depressed i have all kinds of problems and my life and mind are chaotic.

i always suspected i might have bpd but never got a diagnosis or opportunity for treatment until now. i fit the dsm5 criteria perfectly, and now it includes a part about depressive episodes, and one about anxiety.

also my symptoms of ""hypomania"" could be part of bpd too.

i know it's possible to have both bipolar and bpd, but i've got so many diagnoses now??

i hate the idea that i've been on all these meds for so long for nothing, and i'm getting the impulsive urge to go off them.

antidepressants have no effect, seroquel just helps me sleep, and the others do nothing too. i just went off seroquel and started on lithium but i don't know if it's helping yet. i've had some horrific side effects from meds, mostly seroquel. it's made me scared of being on meds long term.

but mostly i just wanna be treated for the right conditions! if you go to a psychiatrist they see bipolar as the predominant diagnosis. they downplay my anxiety (possibly ocd) and what i thought was either cptsd or bpd.

Quetiapine &amp; weight gain,"i’ve been on quetiapine for a couple of years now and it’s working for me but the weight gain is starting to really affect me and i’m not sure what to do. i did gain a small amount of weight on the standard tablets but since being put on the slow release tablets as well around a year ago, i’ve gained a lot of weight and my body shape has changed. it’s all around my chest &amp; middle. it’s affecting me to the point i’m avoiding sex and feel so unbelievably unattractive / embarrassed by the way i look and that is depressing the shit out of me. 

i’m more active then i’ve ever been and i’m not eating as badly as i used to.  i will be seeing my gp as soon as possible but it would be good to have an idea of how to go forward.

Radical Acceptance / Checking the Facts,"hello everyone. i am currently in dbt therapy and the two exercises i’m working on currently are checking the facts and radical acceptance, particularly in the context of the relationship i am in. i started in my paper journal tonight but i’m in need of support and sharing right now so i decided to do my exercise here this evening. 

radical acceptance: 

i had a traumatic brain injury when i was five after falling off a rock wall six feet and striking my head. i grew to develop bipolar, bpd, and alcoholism. i’ve had a very hard time in my life until i came to the point of accepting these things as reality. i’ve done a lot of damage to the people who love me as a result. i’ve done a lot of damage to myself. 

i sometimes feel shame and regret for what i have done. i sometimes feel confident that i am going to get well in the biggest fact of all:

fact: 

i have been on lithium and seroquel since 2013 which began to arrest my bipolar and a large degree of bpd symptoms. in 2016, i got sober from alcohol and drugs through aa and have worked the program consistently and have made drastic changes in my inner and outer life as a result. a few weeks ago, i made the decision to accept my bpd and i started dbt therapy. i am already seeing progress and change. 

my life today shows progress. my damaged relationships are being mended. i am mending the damaged relationship with myself. 

radical acceptance:

i got in a relationship with someone who knew me six months in alcoholism, the difficult first year, and through lots of abuses due to my unresolved bpd. i have damaged and hurt this man considerably. he loves me and wants me when i am showing progress and growth, but becomes uncertain about me when i fail. this makes me frustrated and fearful. i want to be loved as is, with continued improvement and growth. i want to be forgiven unconditionally since i am doing so much work and it shows. 

fact:

i cannot change the past and the hurts i’ve caused him. he knows me good and bad and has the right to choose whether or not to stay with me knowing all of my liabilities. my truth is my truth. i will always need medicine, therapy, and aa to function as close to neurotypical as possible. 

it is my responsibility to accept me and my feelings. it is not the responsibility of anyone else. 

radical acceptance:

i feel that the right partner will take me “as is”, will be able to see me as more than a diagnosis, will want to fight with me as i continue to recover. i feel that i deserve to be loved the same on good days and bad, because i am not staying sick with any of my disabilities. i am working hard to get well. i feel i deserve respect and love for that. 

fact: 

this is the love that i have to give to myself, the relationship i have to have with myself. i cannot make someone have it for me. 

i made a mistake this week attempting to stop my medication (seroquel) thinking it wasn’t a mood stabilizer at such a low dosage and i could safely stop it and lose weight. after 72 hours, i was manic and falling apart. i realized my mistake and got back on it immediately. 

radical acceptance:

the medication mistake showed me that i do indeed need to take this medicine for my stability. without it, my stability stops. 

seeing how i fell to pieces without my medicine has also brought my partner to a point of having to accept or not accept the fact that i need this medication for my stability.  he has expressed concerns at having to face that. it has bothered him all week. 

i feel afraid that he is not going to love me, he will leave me and find someone neurotypical. i’m sad that i have these disabilities. 

fact:

it is my job to accept me. anyone who cannot accept my disabilities as part of my reality, my need for medication, therapy, and aa, is not someone who is suited to me. 

i am more than a diagnosis. i am a courageous person who has made the decision to stand up, face the darkness within her, endure life with a damaged brain and try to learn to live normally. i am worthy of unconditional love. i will do my best to show myself that unconditional love. i will accept myself and i will continue to press forward.",1527814879,False,BPD,2018-06-01 01:01:19,"Radical Acceptance / Checking the Facts hello everyone. i am currently in dbt therapy and the two exercises i’m working on currently are checking the facts and radical acceptance, particularly in the context of the relationship i am in. i started in my paper journal tonight but i’m in need of support and sharing right now so i decided to do my exercise here this evening.

Partner is unhappy because my medication makes me sleep all day,"hi everyone. my partner is very unhappy with the drowsiness/sleepiness side effects that seroquel, trazodone, wellbutrin, klonopin, zoloft, and depakote have on me. he just told me that me being asleep makes him feel alone, set aside, and neglected. i feel like i can't satisfy his needs. i take my meds to keep my bpd undercontrol but consuming them as the doctor directed is ruining my life and relationship.

"Really scared of meds , what does Seroquel ?","hi there . does any of you take seroquel ? 

i'm doing great with my bpd , dont have a fp anymore, see it coming when i'm about to over react and calm down, my social skills are really fine and everybody tells me i look healthy and strong this last months.

What therapy works? (+ medication),"can anyone tell me what's worked for them? 

i've had dbt when i was a teenager and idk if i just wasn't in the right headspace but it didn't do anything for me at the time. i was very suicidal and would dissociate a lot so i didn't feel the coping skills helped me as when i got to that blackout stage i couldn't use any of the coping skills as i didn't remember what happened to me. 

i had one session of psychotherapy many years ago which i found very interesting and thought it could possibly help me with a lot of childhood stuff but was always told i was too vulnerable and unpredictable so i wasn't right for it. 

i'm due to have my initial assessment to look at what therapy i can have at the end of the month and i'm actually lost. i don't want to accept dbt just because they would think it's the go to for bpd when i know it's never helped before, just for it not to help again then me be left on another months long waiting list for something else 😩

also is there any medication anyone has found that helps? i've been on fluoxetine, sertraline, diazepam and quetiapine none of which i've found has helped. i've always been very against accepting anti psychotics as i also suffer on and off with anorexia and i'm worried about the weight gain aspect. but if there's a medicine i know outweighs the side effects i'll definitely consider.

It literally takes guns being fired outside my house for me to feel anything anymore.,"so i'm on 300mg of venlafaxine and 100mg of seroquel. i started venlafaxine 4 years ago to help with depression but instead i just don't feel anxiety anymore. things that should make me feel anxious don't anymore. i started seroquel last year and after being on it for just over a year i successfully rarely feel anything anymore. i don't really notice it in my day to day because i've always had problems with feeling nothing 50% of the time, ever since i was 11.

it was really put into perspective for me today when i heard a 5 gunshots outside at 9:30pm, each shot getting louder. i live in scotland but i know what gun shots sound like, i've used a rifle before and i grew up in the countryside so i would always hear the lords hunting pheasants in the fields near my house. however i moved to a town a couple years ago so gunshots aren't normal. after the 3rd gunshot i closed my blinds, locked the door, turned off all the lights, grabbed my cat and hid under the covers. after the 5th gun shot which was the loudest and closest, the school literally right across the street from me alarms start going off. 

i stay really still, texting my boyfriend asking what i should do. i hear my upstairs neighbours are panicking too. i hear shouting outside and the another gun shot which was further away so whoever was firing the gun had started moving away from the school. after 30 minutes the school alarm turned off but 10 minutes later it turned on again. after an hour the alarm turned off again and i let my cat go concluding that it was over. 

after i felt comfortable to turn the lamp next to my bed on i realised i was feeling some mild anxiety. not panic levels of anxeity but the sort of anxeity i used to feel on the day of an exam in school. i just remember thinking ""huh theres a sensation i haven't felt in a while"" and that when i realised just how numb my emotions have become.

Diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago and not sure whether I still am,"just heads up...
i haven't talked about my bpd for ages and i am wondering if theses are common features. after 6 years of in and out of therapy and drugs, i am kind of over it and i found myself not being able to be fully honest with my therapist. sometimes a little hubris gets in the way even though i pay them not be judged, but i seem to struggle opening up 100% about myself especially when it comes to sexuality and stuff about sex.  so here it goes..


i was diagnosed with bpd 5 years ago at the height of my anorexia when i was a teenager. i kind of grew out of it eventually but then sometimes i wonder if i still have bpd. i don't know whether your personality is meant to be fluid/evolving or whether your inherent distinctive features remain. 
sometimes i have severe mood swings -  i would be depressed for few weeks and then regain sanity and sign up to all the shit that i won't be able to do and then when i become depressed again, i'll hate myself for not having been able to achieve the stuff that my maniac self promised to do. this is especially detrimental when it comes to relationships since i'd make all these promises and befriend everyone when i am super hyper but then, want to kill myself and avoid everyone when i get depressed. 

i also have really bad sense of self-image/respect in a way so i would let myself be in vulnerable positions- i'll try to project myself to guys so they could easily have sex/kiss/play/toy with me physically and sometimes emotionally. i would also romantise short encounters with men (mostly with one night stands) and be a little clingy and then let my whole entire day veer around stalking his facebook/instagram and masturbating to the moment that we shared. speaking of masturbation, i get horny very often for god knows why and would just watch videos and feel myself and then get really disgusted at myself afterward. 
i'd rather get laid but then i am too insecure about my body and i feel like everyone will reject me and comment on my physique so i am too scared to go out and meet decent people or people. then again, this paradigm changes when i am hyper. 

i ve been on seroquel, xanax, lexapro, zolft, prozac, dumirox, imipramine and lately topamax which is an anti convulsant drug. i stopped taking my medication 6 months ago because i was feeling more suicidal and self harm despite the fact that i was getting my shit together. i am 21 years old and i just cannot deal with anything. sometimes i wish i am constantly depressed because i cannot handle the sense of joy that i feel when i am hyper and thinking that i have wasted all of my time being a fool and depressed when i could have been living life to the fullest.

&amp;#x200b;

the last two months have been fucking crazy.

&amp;#x200b;

i lost my house, had to move into another place, my best mates are moving to another town, i got involved with a girl that i absolutely could not handle, ended up in hospital and have been put on antipsychotics, which has put extreme fear of gaining weight into me so now i'm struggling with food again. fucking yay.

&amp;#x200b;

about a month ago i found out i had to leave my current house as i live in supported accomodation and the charity that runs it had to move me to another house share full of strangers. a year ago i moved into my old place and befriended everyone pretty quickly but they've all since moved on, including my housemate and her boyfriend who are pretty much the only people i trust. they're moving to the next town over but i fucking hate public transport so it's gonna be a struggle to go see them, which pretty much leaves me with zero friends in the area. the only other people i know in this town are former girlfriends/boyfriends and hookups. great.

&amp;#x200b;

on november 25th i had a full blown freakout on a scale that i haven't had since last summer. from what i remember i woke up, had an agrument with my mum on the phone before breaking up with my girlfriend and taking a shit ton of my antidepressants. ended up on a heart monitor in hospital all night. next day i went home and was back to normal. i didn't even feel in control.

&amp;#x200b;

the girlfriend in question was friends with a person that i met during a freakout who had a pretty dubious grip on consent. almost a year of no contact and he admits he's still obsessed w me. in january he let himself into my house and started trying to get into my room while i had a hookup round. stalks my social medias etc. just a general fucking creep. the girl i was with was completely histrionic every time i couldn't talk to her and was just generally way too into me, we'd only been together 3 weeks. i knew it wasn't helping her and i had to let her go because she was self destructing over me.

&amp;#x200b;

ended up getting referred to a mental health team and they're now in the process of diagnosing me with bipolar. i'm on quetiapine. obviously i've seen the side effect of weight gain and now i'm back to avoiding food like the plague. last time i starved myself was in october where i was eating under 800 calories a day and walking 10k steps for around a month, lost about 20 lbs. put 10 of them back on and now i hate myself. yay.

most of the time now i'm either asleep or high. i'm resorting to texting exes for company because i don't know anyone else. i feel completely forgotten about and it's shit but at the same time i know that blending with people usually leads to disaster with me.

&amp;#x200b;

the other day my mate said something that stuck with me about how mismatched my outfit was. half of me looked grunge/emo ish like i normally do, then i had an addidas bag from my 'chav' phase and i think a bomber jacket i bought on impulse. i kinda realised how these days i don't even try to fit into an archetype or niche to be liked. i just kind of... exist. i have a bad habit of finding out what people like and them morphing myself into their ideal best friend/boyfriend/whatever.

&amp;#x200b;

so yeah. 4 pm and i'm still in my pyjamas. i don't want to go to my family's place for christmas because of my dad. i don't know what the fuck i'm doing except getting sick notes, getting my universal credit and fucking up. completely lost my path. i suspect i have dyscalculia because numbers are and always have been a way to freak my brain the fuck out, i can't even count properly, so pretty much any job i can get with my zero qualifications has been ruled out. i'm strangely calm though, i can't really feel any emotion strongly enough for it to matter.

&amp;#x200b;

what do i do? sit it out? try and change something? i don't know if i like how quetiapine makes me feel and the weight gain aspect scares me, but on the other hand i haven't been manic once since i started taking them. has anyone here been on antipsychotics before? i appreciate any advice &lt;3",1576772597,False,BPD,2019-12-19 16:23:17,"mega meltdown, bipolar diagnosis and stress- help?

Going medication free?,"i've been on medication for over 2 years to deal with the symptoms of bpd, and it's helped for sure. i started off with zoloft and seroquel, but changed those this year because of the side effect (weight gain and sexual dysfunction at low doses because i'm very sensitive to medication). i'm on lamotrigine and wellbutrin currently, but for the last while i've really been noticing the effect both or either one is having on my short-term memory. i'm forgetting things i never forgot before (putting away groceries, dinner i'm in the middle of prepping). it's just really a crappy thing to have to deal with.

lost my fp,"i lost my fp yesterday.
so far i’ve been strong. i haven’t messaged him.
i am writing this post to help me stay strong. maybe it will help someone too.

yesterday my fp went off on me. we had only been talking for 2 or so months but i had shared a lot about myself with him. he knows i have bpd and he is familiar with it because it turns out that his past two girlfriends also had it. he is interested in some things i hate- one including the fact that he is religious as is his whole family, so that’s a big one. i have never even been interested in any kind of religion. anyway, i am trying to remind myself of the things about him that reinforce the fact that we weren’t “right” for each other.

we talked about only having a sexual relationship and went back and forth on that every few days. i think psychologically i fell for him a bit because he has many traits and interests that would make it so i wouldn’t fall for him and be infatuated again. and i am trying to remind myself of that. he’s a 32 year old man that lives with his parents and has no intentions of moving out. i went to his house once and kind of assumed he lived in a basement or some kind of apartment type thing at his parents house- fine, i won’t judge. but turns out his bedroom is right next to their room and there are pictures of jesus everywhere in his house. he also had to keep his bedroom door open while we were hanging out.

we hooked up 2 days ago in that jesus-y house. i got him off, of course, and i got nothing. which was fine, whatever.

he knows i’ve been in a few abusive relationships before, both emotionally abusive and sexually abusive and he knows some of the stuff that happened.

that being said, i said something that i thought was fairly innocuous and he got really mad at me. he told me to fuck off and leave him alone but he did that thing where he told me to go away but then sent 15 messages in a row back to me. i told him it was not ok to say those things to me- trying to be strong and stick up for myself. he told me i deserved it. i am almost 30 now and have had a lot of life experiences and logically i know these red flags. he turned on me so quickly and said mean stuff, especially knowing my past with abusive relationships and guys acting similar to me. he didn’t apologize and instead told me i deserved it. i thought he was different.

i had panic attacks during this situation with him. it really triggered me hard when i thought i had more “power” or self control than that. 
i am so lucky and grateful that i had two very supportive friends to talk to about it while it was happening. if i didn’t, i think i would have been a whole lot worse yesterday. it’s hard when you have had so many people tell you and reinforce that i do deserve to be treated like that. i kept trying to remind myself that what i said was not bad and even if it were, i don’t deserve to be talked to/treated like that.

you know what i did? i ignored his messages. later that night he messaged me with a kind of half-assed apology. basically like “i shouldn’t have said stuff that especially to you because you’re so sensitive but....” and defending it. he also said we shouldn’t talk anymore.

you know what i did? i wanted to be “strong”
enough to ignore him and not respond at all but i simply responded with “yeah. it’s definitely over.” he never responded to that. i have to say that it was so hard for me to not fall into that addictive cycle and respond to his 15 messages in a row etc but i did it. i wanted to write back to him telling him how much he hurt me. while it was happening i was so sad and triggered but a few hours later i felt the anger. i wanted to message him with a “fuck you” and “you don’t know what you’re missing” but i didn’t message him at all after i said “yeah. it’s definitely over.” 

last night while i was laying in bed in the dark next to my 3 year old, my mind started cycling back through my trauma. i dissociated in a way that i never have before, that i remember at least. when i do dissociate, which doesn’t happen often anymore because i’ve found the right combination of meds and a good-ish headspace, it usually just kind of feels disconnected-y, mentally. this time it was both physical and emotional. it felt like my mind and vision kind of shook and i felt fuzzy and floaty for a few seconds. this happened twice but the feeling passed quickly. i gave in to thinking about my past and the trauma but i went downstairs and turned on a tv show and didn’t message him again at night when i was alone and lonely and bored.

another win- i wanted to drug myself up a bit to sleep. i take seroquel every night and have klonopin for panic attacks. i took 2 seroquel and a klonopin and i had a second klonopin in my hand. i put it in my mouth and actually spit it out because i decided it was too much to take and i didn’t need to drug myself that hard. 

i haven’t messaged him still. i can’t bring myself to block him or anything because i know i would just get more obsessed with convincing myself that he messaged me again and wanting to go back.

i do feel very lonely though and am worried that when i start to get extra lonely, i will give in and message him. i definitely had to talk myself out of it last night. the fact that this happened the day after we hooked up is hopefully just a coincidence. 

anyway. i have some wins that i am trying to remind myself of and that i should be proud that i am resisting and cutting off someone that has thrown up some real red flags. it doesnt have to be this way and i dont deserve to be treated with disrespect. i don’t have to get all of my self worth from attention from the opposite sex.

we talked about only having a sexual relationship and went back and forth on that every few days. i think psychologically i fell for him a bit because he has many traits and interests that would make it so i wouldn’t fall for him and be infatuated again. and i am trying to remind myself of that. he’s a 32 year old man that lives with his parents and has no intentions of moving out. i went to his house once and kind of assumed he lived in a basement or some kind of apartment type thing at his parents house- fine, i won’t judge. but turns out his bedroom is right next to their room and there are pictures of jesus everywhere in his house. he also had to keep his bedroom door open while we were hanging out.

we hooked up 2 days ago in that jesus-y house. i got him off, of course, and i got nothing. which was fine, whatever.

he knows i’ve been in a few abusive relationships before, both emotionally abusive and sexually abusive and he knows some of the stuff that happened.

that being said, i said something that i thought was fairly innocuous and he got really mad at me. he told me to fuck off and leave him alone but he did that thing where he told me to go away but then sent 15 messages in a row back to me. i told him it was not ok to say those things to me- trying to be strong and stick up for myself. he told me i deserved it. i am almost 30 now and have had a lot of life experiences and logically i know these red flags. he turned on me so quickly and said mean stuff, especially knowing my past with abusive relationships and guys acting similar to me. he didn’t apologize and instead told me i deserved it. i thought he was different.

i had panic attacks during this situation with him. it really triggered me hard when i thought i had more “power” or self control than that. 
i am so lucky and grateful that i had two very supportive friends to talk to about it while it was happening. if i didn’t, i think i would have been a whole lot worse yesterday. it’s hard when you have had so many people tell you and reinforce that i do deserve to be treated like that. i kept trying to remind myself that what i said was not bad and even if it were, i don’t deserve to be talked to/treated like that.

you know what i did? i ignored his messages. later that night he messaged me with a kind of half-assed apology. basically like “i shouldn’t have said stuff that especially to you because you’re so sensitive but....” and defending it. he also said we shouldn’t talk anymore.

you know what i did? i wanted to be “strong”
enough to ignore him and not respond at all but i simply responded with “yeah. it’s definitely over.” he never responded to that. i have to say that it was so hard for me to not fall into that addictive cycle and respond to his 15 messages in a row etc but i did it. i wanted to write back to him telling him how much he hurt me. while it was happening i was so sad and triggered but a few hours later i felt the anger. i wanted to message him with a “fuck you” and “you don’t know what you’re missing” but i didn’t message him at all after i said “yeah. it’s definitely over.” 

last night while i was laying in bed in the dark next to my 3 year old, my mind started cycling back through my trauma. i dissociated in a way that i never have before, that i remember at least. when i do dissociate, which doesn’t happen often anymore because i’ve found the right combination of meds and a good-ish headspace, it usually just kind of feels disconnected-y, mentally. this time it was both physical and emotional. it felt like my mind and vision kind of shook and i felt fuzzy and floaty for a few seconds. this happened twice but the feeling passed quickly. i gave in to thinking about my past and the trauma but i went downstairs and turned on a tv show and didn’t message him again at night when i was alone and lonely and bored.

another win- i wanted to drug myself up a bit to sleep. i take seroquel every night and have klonopin for panic attacks. i took 2 seroquel and a klonopin and i had a second klonopin in my hand. i put it in my mouth and actually spit it out because i decided it was too much to take and i didn’t need to drug myself that hard. 

i haven’t messaged him still. i can’t bring myself to block him or anything because i know i would just get more obsessed with convincing myself that he messaged me again and wanting to go back.

i do feel very lonely though and am worried that when i start to get extra lonely, i will give in and message him. i definitely had to talk myself out of it last night. the fact that this happened the day after we hooked up is hopefully just a coincidence. 

anyway. i have some wins that i am trying to remind myself of and that i should be proud that i am resisting and cutting off someone that has thrown up some real red flags. it doesnt have to be this way and i dont deserve to be treated with disrespect. i don’t have to get all of my self worth from attention from the opposite sex.

Literally ruined my relationship because I'm highly abusive and crazy,"like it says on the tin. i'm not just bpd, i'm also an abusive piece of shit. 

i've physically attacked my bf multiple times, did it again tonight... i kicked down his bedroom door after he told me to get out of the apartment, what the fuck, because i was feeling abandoned or tricked or something and then he had his gun out because he was worried for his safety (not loaded, i think to scare me or potentially use as a weapon if i attacked him) and i looked at the gun and thought ""i know it's probably not loaded but i hope it is"" and then i attacked him in a way that deliberately left me open to getting shot. he didn't shoot me, of course, but i proceeded to try and grapple with him for the gun in an attempt to shoot myself. 

this was at the end of an all-day fight that included lots of screaming and such, of course.

then we both decided to go no contact for 7 days. which i thought was a good idea! but then i proceeded to call and text him upwards of 100 times in the next 4 hours. he picked up and answered some of them, and was even kind about it some of the time, which is 1000x more than i deserve.

no one needs to tell me how out of line it is. but i keep doing it. i'm literally the worst person i've ever met or heard of. he has forgiven me about 100000 times more than i deserve. he's blocked me now but i certainly deserve it. 

but even though i know that...

* my brain says ""let's text him thirty more times..."" and if i say ""no lets not"" my brain says back ""how about the urge to cut yourself all over your legs instead? no? then call."" 
* i say to brain ""let's do distress tolerance skills"" and my brain says ""let's not because all you're learning to tolerate is the distress of being fucking worthless, a piece of shit person, and knowing healthy love is forever out of reach."" 
* i can't even kid myself at that point, because if i try to delude myself by saying ""we all have value"" i remember that reddit routinely tells people like me to go die in a garage can and i remember that i absolutely deserve that. 
* cue another call to boyfriend, because if he picks up and i say sorry and he says ""that's okay, i forgive you"" in that way he says it, i can tell myself ""see it's okay bf still sees value in me i should keep trying to be better.""

but he's not tonight. he's blocked me or something. i'm resisting the mega-crazy urge to go drive to our apartment (i've been staying at my rents) and wake him up or something. we were having such a good morning just this morning, and a good day and good week, and now he won't even pick up the phone. he's never done this to me before, even with all the super crazy shit i've done. and while my brain knows ""this is more than reasonable,"" my body is like ""you are in agony. this is the same as dying."" 

i've never been this out of control before. on buspar but thinking of starting seroquel. klonopin worked (as in, i was calm enough to utilize my distress tolerance skills and avoid abusiveness) but pdoc won't write for it. am in individual and couples therapy regularly, recent inpatient hospitalization, and disappointing outpatient program. only thing that's helped is buspar (according to bf) and moving out &amp; in with my rents so i see him far less than i used to.

i tell my boyfriend he should leave. he doesn't. if i talk about breaking up for our health, because it would be best for us, he makes it clear that he would not want that. even now he does not want to split, just wants time apart.

but more importantly, i need to change. breakup or not, i need to figure out how not to be such a piece of shit. i want to stop, but it's like this crazy person in my brain i have no control over takes over my body. she even has a different voice than me, all high and eerily calm and self-assured. when i'm threatening suicide, i tell my brain ""stop this, this is very bad!"" the girl in my brain says, creepy and calm, ""*you have to do this*."" and then i do. don't think it's a hallucination, technically, because i don't actually *hear* her with my ears, i just experience it as a super-invasive thought with its own vocal quality &amp; personality.

therapists don't know this. i try to tell them everything, but some of the stuff i do is too shameful to share. i try my best to hint at it but i literally cannot process what i've turned into enough to share out loud.

i feel like i've read every self-help book in existence, taken every drug, tried every 'communication technique,' nothing works. learned lots of other great stuff in the process, but hasn't made a dent here. 

about to try lsd because you read stories online of people being miracle cured by lsd and at this point it couldn't possibly get any worse. one bad trip would be nothing compared everything i've done.",1613199208,True,BPD,2021-02-13 06:53:28,"Literally ruined my relationship because I'm highly abusive and crazy like it says on the tin. i'm not just bpd, i'm also an abusive piece of shit.

Feels like a brain parasite,"delete if not allowed

i can't cope with this malfunctioning brain, i can't understand stories in movies and can barely read anymore when i used to be able to visualize everything i read as a young person. i have tried 5mg dexamphetamine and it helped but also made me more impulsive and i hate stimulants in general, so no amphetamines or phenidates. i also quit smoking as i believe it was making me more neurotic.        i am running out of outlets to escape this.

&amp;#x200b;

my shrink started treating me for bpd and started dbt with me but i left therapy shortly after and since then i have been kicking myself for it.

also has anyone here tried memantine? if so please do tell your experiences. i also have ocd that is evil and obsessional and i do still pick my skin multiple times a day and twist hair and have experienced minor psychosis in the past and had very bad hypochondria. 

&amp;#x200b;

if anyone has any success stories with meds or dbt and erp i would love to hear them as in the past i have taken seroquel, abilfy, zoloft, luvox, remeron, multiple benzodiazepines and anafranil but quit that one after a day because i thought i was gonna have a fit. i am off all meds and don't know if i ever want to take them again due to side effects.

I am freaking the fuck out,"i've taken countless meds for years and it's nothing new to me, but recently i've been googling the side effects of lamictal and seroquel and god there are so many and i just spent 3 hours going through all these case studies like seroquel can cause sudden death from heart arrythmia??? and lamictal causes memory loss? and a condition where your blood vessels individually burst? there are so many more i'm shakingggg lmfao i want to stop taking them!! and there are so many irreversible conditions you can get like tardive dyskenesia.

after i wrote that text, i became more and more paranoid and i eventually started having symptoms of an early psychosis. i started becoming suicidal and in a panic attack, i called for help. after many tests, 5 months on xanax, and beginning therapy i got diagnosed with bpd and adhd (that one suprised me quite a bit, haha).

before i ask the big question on the title, lemme tell something about my current situation. as you might have read (or not) me and my roommate were having a sexual relationship. luckily, he eventually went into therapy and got antidepressants. turns out he has a big risk of getting depressed in the winter (and other factors were involved.) he started dating someone else after therapy, and it made my paranoia worse (that was before i sought help). his person of interest was meh, and we slowly started having a sexual relationship again. he was fully supportive of my diagnosis, and i told him everything i was feeling and we became best friends. i don't know what would've happened if he wasn't there for me after all. in summer, we were getting closer and closer and things started getting better. still, we were in this open relationship of a sort. during a celebration party with our work, (he is my colleague as well) we got shitfaced and i started flirting with another coworker of mine. at a point, we all got home and my roommate (let's call him s again) s persuaded my coworker that i was dtf, and that he should get to my room to suprise me with .. sex. so yeah, i thought he was gone, but when i got to my room i found my coworker naked. i was drunk and in an impulsive mood so i had sex with him. this meant drama, because s admitted he was in love with me the day after, and that he wanted to prove himself otherwise, so he convinced the guy to have sex with me to get over the ""feeling"". i was pretty mad, but after all it was my choice, so my fault too. i didn't like him that much anyway, he was kind of a douche after all. we both apologized to each other and i admitted to him i had feelings too. we made an agreement we wouldn't sleep with other people, but somehow he told me he was ok if i slept with girls (i'm bisexual). oh, well. so the last month of summer we spent kind of ""couply"" but still had an open relationship. in september i started school again, i redid my year (now with ritalin, shit is helpful as fuck) and wanted to focus on getting my grades. i tend to hyperfocus everything, and was really into the new project. we also got a really good mark, and my self confidence went up. but i slowly started paying less attention to s. the thought of being in love scared me. i started mentalisation based therapy this sept, and it was confronting as fuck. i started asking myself if being in a relationship was smart or not. i was distancing myself towards him and suddenly my whole sex drive was gone! note that i also started taking seroquel (an antipsychoti thing (i'm not english sorry)) after tapering xanax, and i thought this was killing my mood. but now, on this moment i'm still not interested in sex, nor even intimacy. is it because i'm getting to know myself? is it because i'm discovering my patterns regarding bpd, and maybe realalizing these patterns might hurt him or me in the future? or is it because i'm so focused on school, my other interests collapse? or maybe i don't want sex with him anymore, because i'm not in love? or maybe because i feel free, and i want to pay attention to mbt and my skills, and maybe seek a relationship with a woman? (i've never had one with a woman). so so many questions, and he already asked me to be in a relationship btw. it's because he doesn't want an open relationship anymore, and thinks this isn't helping, because it's only causing us to fight.

so, thanks for reading. this was quite long and personal and i'm pretty stressed regarding this situation. he asked me a week ago btw. maybe one more question for you guys; what are your thoughts on starting a relationship when in an early stage of therapy? what are your experiences?

I feel more functional and “normal” than I ever have,"it’ll be a long one so here we go..

in the last 3 months i have been on lamotrigine. i had to channel my bpd brain when i went to the doctors and coerced them in to writing me up a script. i told them that i had taken it previously (i hadn’t been to the doctors in that area for a long time and i told him that i had it ages ago but stopped taking it because i felt better). so i was super convincing and used a lot of terminology.

while this isn’t an orthodox way to get medication, i had really no other option as i had tried about 10 different medications since being 16 (now 26) and periods of time where i hadn’t taken anything.

i had been diagnosed earlier in the year with bpd and bp2, which i had a feeling this was the case for awhile now... so all the medications over the years just kicked me more out of balance and i’ve had to ensure many withdrawals, sleepless nights, restless legs... i felt defeated. on the anti-psychotic front, i had seroquel for some time and i gained so much weight. my eating disorder thought patterns came back although i kept myself accountable and gave myself the firm no. i eat healthy and exercise sometimes/rarely so part my fault and part the medication ... moving on ...

i spent a lot of time doing extensive research and i thought lamotrigine made the most sense to try.

i started on 25mg and have slowly titrated to the therapeutic dose of 200mg. the most recent script i got was about a month ago for 100mg so i’ve been taking two of those in the morning.

i got some headaches and lost my appetite in the beginning and each time i titrated i had headaches.

i went to a psychologist a few weeks ago, after i had quit my job of 2 years as i had got another one (better pay, better team and new role). so that blew my anxiety right out of the water. we spoke about the wise mind and emotional regulation and she wants to see me again.

my world is now in colour. i feel things. i feel happy! my body isn’t sore (potential fibromyalgia but i could put it down to depression). i am sensitive to sad things i hear about or see on television. i have always been sensitive as a person, but i had felt numb for the longest time or my bpd amplified it and triggered rage hypomania so it was nice to actually feel something authentic, goosebumps and tears in my eyes from something i felt. i rarely cry! but these are empathetic and heartfelt moments for me, which i haven’t had since i was a teenager. i am a lot more understanding and i can have a conversation without feeling defensive or worried about what people think of me.

despite lying to the doctors which i don’t really feel bad about, it was the best decision i have made.

i just wanted to share this with the community in case anybody is in the same boat as me. do your research and weigh up the pros and cons. this is not advice, this is my story so far and for somebody who thought there was no hope and i would be this mess of a borderline and bipolar person clutching straws to keep her life together. it’s so much easier now.

BPD Treatment Without Medication?,"hi guys. i'm new to this sub and just want to say i breathed a huge sigh of relief when i found it.

&amp;#x200b;

i was first told i have a borderline personality disorder three years ago. a nurse told me while i was staying at a restpite after my worst breakdown. i wasn't willing to accept another diagnosis at the time, and threw it into my bin of ""things people don't understand about me"". 

&amp;#x200b;

now, after all the setbacks of this year, i realized, ""hang on a minute, \*i\* have a problem here"". 

&amp;#x200b;

my question is, is there anyone here currently in treatment, or who has undergone treatment, without the aid of medication ? i've been on several antidepressants over the past few years, none of which have been beneficial to me. i'm worried that if i go and seek help, i'll be advised straight away onto an antidepressant, or mood stabiliser. 

&amp;#x200b;

i'm sure there are many people who benefit from being on the right medication for them, and it may be the case that i was treated for the wrong things in the past. i managed to stop taking quetiapine (seroquel) as a sleep aid for the first time in three years earlier this year, and am extremely proud of that. i don't want to start taking any other medication unless it is absolutely the best thing for me. 

&amp;#x200b;

Switching meds + disability talk update!,"some of you may have seen my post about struggling to keep a job, considering disability, etc. i’ve since deleted it bc it was more of a vent post, but i have an update/plan. 

i had an appointment this morning and told my doctor i was thinking about applying for disability bc of my struggles surrounding jobs. she said i have a shot at qualifying, but disability isn’t her goal for me and i agree. we decided i should go ahead and apply and i should also look for part time rather than full time work. that way i have something to support myself while i wait to hear about the disability and we can work on narrowing down the problem/finding ways to make holding down a job easier for me.

what meds have worked for you?,"i am currently on zoloft and divalproex. 
ive tried 8 medications prior. 
nothing works... 
ive been on these meds for longer than a year &amp; during my last 'episode,' i decided i am no longer going to take them, as i don't believe they work. 

i am diagnosed with borderline personality disorder - i have extreme anger issues, depression &amp; anxiety.
i feel angry all of the time and am easily irritable.

Seroquel?,"hi, it's my first post here and i try not to read too much because i tend to internalize everything i read so the more i read about bpd, the more bpd i subconsciously act. (is that a bpd thing lol?)

i've suspected i was bpd since i was 17 (i'm 28 now) but got semi-officially diagnosed this weekend (my shrink suspected it too, or has officially diagnosed me and not told me, not sure)  after going to the doctor to ask for meds since my emotions and thoughts have been getting way out of control (probably because trying to be sober, i've been addicted to dxm for 10 years on and off which was kind of how i self-medicate i guess). i say semi-officially because i feel like it's kind of hasty to give me a diagnostic after one meeting, but whatever. i'll see a pdoc eventually, but probably not for a year because canada wait times :p 

anyways, i've been on celexa for 5+ years now but it's just not doing anything anymore so they're going to taper me off. i got prescribed 50mg seroquel at night and 12.5mg as needed during the day for anxiety, up to twice a day.  i started it saturday night, haven't taken any small day doses yet, only 50mg before bed but so far i'm feeling like...really mentally slow? i feel sluggish and groggy but not like i want to sleep either, just as if my brain itself is tired. i'm used to feeling mentally slow sometimes because abusing dxm and ketamine does that, but that's different.

anyone on this med? is this going to go away soon? i was on risperdal for a while and the sleepiness went away real fast (a few days) but it didn't make me feel mentally slow like this at all. stopped it because i was lactating and i would've had to up my dose since i wasn't getting any effects anymore but i didn't have access to a doctor at the time anyway.

"I set up an appointment with a psychiatrist, and will be seeking mood stabilizers for my impulsivity and emotional reactivity. Curious from those in the BPD community what their experiences with these meds have been like?","tldr; look at the title. 

i'm a borderline, and i'm 27 (f). i've been in a fairly stable relationship, despite some of my slightly erratic behaviors over the last year. i'm trying to settle down and get my life in order so that i may have children of my own, and i flip-flop between believing my partner and i will do this, to not wanting my partner to be the father of my children. this is mostly due to the splitting - which i think is my worst symptom in relationships. the splitting leads to the emotional reactivity, and the emotional reactivity leads to the impulsivity. i make rash decisions and can act erratically, but i think i've come very far since i was formally diagnosed at 14, and again at 20. i have been in therapy fairly consistently for the last 7 years. 

i think my difficulty, as of late, is accepting that my natural impulses, decisions, thoughts, feelings, etc., are all incorrect, or faltered in some way. i can lack perspective. it is hard for me in the moment of emotional activation to be objective (not that anyone is ever objective about themselves) about the big picture of my life. when i am feeling an emotion, i become the emotion. when consumed, i shut down, i think. or, my logic does. and then i do completely insane shit.

that's probably too harsh of a judgment on myself, but it is what it is. i've been reading some articles about mood stabilizers as treatment for borderline personality disorder, and found some promising statistics about drugs like quetiapine and so on being good for impulsivity and emotional reactivity specifically. if anyone cares to share their experiences with mood stabilizers, i'd really appreciate it. my appointment isn't until december 11th, so i'd like to really mull over whether these kinds of meds are the ones i should request.

My new psychiatrist is the absolute worst,"took me almost 3 months to finally see him. he calls me an hour earlier than my appointment and can barely understand him. he talked to me for 20 mins and diagnosed me with schizophrenia then put me on seroquel. i haven't slept in 3 days because the seroquel makes me high as balls then makes me hallucinate and then i'm too afraid to sleep. it's like an acid trip when i try to sleep but a very bad one where baby yoda grows huge fingers and is after me then my animal crossing villagers turned on me too and went distorted. 

so i called him today hoping to get advice or a different prescription and he gave me the wrong fucking number. i googled him to find the right one and this guy has like 6 phone numbers and then it came up that he has gross negligence on his record from just last year, and he has a shit ton of reviews saying how unreliable and sketchy he is.

i finally found the right number and the receptionist sounded like she didn't give a shit then accused me of not taking my medications only to find out he wrote down another prescription for lamictal but forgot to call it in?? i called my pharmacy and they said there was no prescription for lamictal. 

so then the receptionist said she'd forward my message to him and hed call me back today. well he didn't and now i have to wait all weekend.

i’m now 21. i have been on seroquel for six years. i advised my doctors that the meds just did not do their purpose - stabilise my moods - anymore. instead, i was more using it to go to sleep. my doctors allowed me to go from my 50mg to 25mg, then to halve the 25mg and after two weeks of that, i could stop. 

last night, i slept without it purposely for the first time. sleep was awful. i didn’t fall asleep until 2am. i woke up at 5am. then stayed awake until 6am. then went back to sleep and woke again at 9.30. back to sleep. awake fully at 10.30. i felt like utter shit. like the zombie feeling you get when you first start it. 

tonight, i had to call into work today at 12.50am (i was set to start at 6am) because i cannot get to sleep. i’m wide awake.

Lamotrigine or quetiapine (seroquel),"does anyone have any good experience with either of these? in terms of side effects too. my psychiatrist told me to try 1 for a month and then the other for another month to see which i prefer. does anyone have any recommendations on which to try first? i’m also in the middle of my exam season at college and i heard that some of these make you really tired, so i don’t know if i should wait until after my exams to start taking it? if so, i don’t really want to be tired all through summer either. i’ve seen that lamotrigine can also give you rashes which does scare me too 😞

How do you date as a straight male with BPD?,"when i was in fourth grade, back when people began to get crushes and boys and girls started to look at each other differently, i realized something was 'off' about me. granted, i was only maybe 10 at the time but ever since that moment i've an unexplainable feeling that things were just never going to work themselves out naturally in life. 

fast forward eleven years and here i am not, at 21, and i still haven't figured out how the fuck dating, or basic socializing for that matter, works. it's not like i don't understand the concepts, i've watched enough videos, read enough articles, etc., it just feels like it is literally something mythical that i will never have the pleasure of participating in. when i see couples in the streets or see the few friends that i have interact with women, it seems so unreal and foreign to me. and the stress and anxiety regarding the topic doesn't help keep my dissociation in check either. 

one thing i personally feel is that i am not a 'sexual' being--if that makes any sense. i'm not asexual by any means, i'm clearly attracted to women, i can fantasize about having sex, despite my nonexistent history with it or dating, but i can't 'act' sexual. i can't flirt, i can't show interest, it's as if i'm either 'not allowed to' or i can't bring myself to express those feelings as feels like i might as well be committing a crime. 

now, don't get me wrong, i'm absolutely pathetic at socializing to begin with and still have not made a single friend during my two years at my college's main campus, so it's not like i have any abundance of opportunities to interact or socialize with women, or anyone essentially, but in every interaction i've had in the past, i might as well have been a eunuch. i'm sure people liked me in high school, i'm sure people must have expected me to flirt or be the one to take the first steps, but i'm so hopelessly lost with the whole thing that i don't even know how to take the steps to improve. 

i'm curious as to if these problems are in part from my bpd or more from my social anxiety and generalized anxiety disorders, (or my major depression or adhd possibly) but quite frankly i don't give a fuck. i just want to make progress. i just want to grow up. i'm a 21 year old male wasting the golden years of my life in college and i have the dating skills of a fucking fourth grader. 

if there are any males here with bpd, please, if you can give me any advice on how to socialize and date, i would be forever indebted to you. i'm growing tired of life itself with the constant torture of my thoughts and mind. i'm worried that if my situation continues any longer i might be dead before i graduate. 

note: i'm currently in psychodynamic therapy, which has done jack shit for the 6+ months i've been in it so i'm going to switching to some form of 'group therapy', plus i've been through a number of medications and am currently on viibryd, seroquel, adderall, and xanax of which do little to nothing for my social abilities nor my overall mental state.",1551923915,False,BPD,2019-03-07 01:58:35,"How do you date as a straight male with BPD? when i was in fourth grade, back when people began to get crushes and boys and girls started to look at each other differently, i realized something was 'off' about me. granted, i was only maybe 10 at the time but ever since that moment i've an unexplainable feeling that things were just never going to work themselves out naturally in life.

is this normal after coming of Quetiapine,"i have bpd and adhd . i used to be diagnosied with psychosis but it was later then understood that i hve not had a psychosis episode but rather just brief symptoms. i have been told by my psychiatrist to stop taking my quetiapine after taking it since october 2020 , i was taking 175mg and had to taper off it by decreasing 25mg less every week, i have been off it for a week. i am also taking a small dose of 5mg of methylphenidate as i am being titrated on it for adhd. i keep seeing a tiny fly flying in front of me randomly for days and randomly disappears and reappears. at first it was real, i took a pic of it and a friend told me they could see it. i'd see it in the same room whilst im relaxing, but i was also freaking out a bit trying to figure out if it was real. then i saw it again but in a different room which doesnt happen, i kept trying to reach out for it and to move it away but it'd hover away or disappear and come near my face

Reevaluating my diagnosis [vent],"so for about three years now i've lived with the diagnosis of bpd. it fit in every possible way, made perfect sense to me, and my treatment progressed positively, minus a few hitches. today, however, my first appointment after leaving inpatient treatment ended on the topic of reevaluating that diagnosis. the possible diagnoses being either major depressive disorder with psychotic features or schizophrenia. holy shit, *schizophrenia*?!

i accepted the idea of reevaluating since there's honestly no reason not to at least hear them out. the reasoning was based on some specific things that have come to light since taking seroquel for the past couple months (or so). things i have been experiencing for years that i always assumed were normal for everyone. 

they were really interested in the fact that i had always felt like someone was watching, whether it be a love interest, authority figure, or big unknown. i always felt like someone was watching me and adjusted my actions in life accordingly. i assumed everyone felt that way. it's what i called conscience, i guess.

they were also really interested in the visual disturbances i experienced all the time until starting seroquel. breathing shadows, very defined faces in patterns, 'shrinking' visuals around objects, and the occasional 'living movements' inanimate objects would make in dim light. again, i've almost always experienced this and just figured it was something everyone experienced as some sort of false illusion.

they got me though when it came to inner dialogue and how it would jumble up my thought processes, inability to speak without getting confused or agitated half of the time, and the way it would get intensely distracting. this part is hard to explain because i know i'm overthinking a lot and get sort of caught in a loop of trying to make sense but fearing i'm not. that leads into the final bit.

paranoia. i feel as if my world has come crashing down around me a bit since realizing just how paranoid i am. constantly. assuming every word, action, look is being questioned by everyone else. every motive being dissected endlessly by friends, family, strangers. i feel lost, a bit shattered.

so that's what this is about. i don't know how to feel. i don't know if i'm falling into the trap of creating the diagnosis to fit me or if this is something that is actually a reality for me. i knew bpd. i knew splitting. i knew black/white thinking. it all fit. right? did i make it real? of course no one can answer this for me, i know that. i'm just stuck in this stupid loop, unable to sleep even with the seroquel making my eyes feel like they're full of sand. i am trying to keep in mind that i have improved significantly in the past few months, regardless of what diagnosis i end up with. the seroquel is working amazingly well for me. i have to keep that in mind and try not to panic.

"I'm starting to finally heal and figure things out, I've never felt better.","for 16 years, i’ve known darin. that’s more than half of my life. he’s the only one to ever know me enough to see that i was misdiagnosed. i was diagnosed bipolar type 1 with psychosis and prescribed seroquel, lithium, and clonazepam. very heavy drugs, to say the least. i kicked his ass in an heb once, so junked out on seroquel, i have no memory of it. if it wasn’t for him, i would still be on it. i would still be on that heavily-drugged, misdiagnosed path. my mother would know no better, she chose her own path. a path of opiates, and more importantly, denial. if darin wouldn’t have known me so well, or cared as much as he did, i’d still be there, in that pit of hell and misery. but he did. he cared, and he helped. in the days following the heb incident, he told me his thoughts. i listened and abandoned those prescribed drugs instantly. i would find out in the months that followed that he was right more than ever. i was re-diagnosed as borderline personality disorder, and medication is not prescribed for that disorder, only talk-therapy. that was what i’ve needed. i checked myself in for in-patient for two weeks and got busy fixing me. i know i need help. but, lets think for a minute. my mother and father both didn’t know me well enough to see this. i had and still have zero other friends. so, without darin, i’d still be in my overly-medicated-misdiagnosed-hell. 
	 i was diagnosed correctly in august 2016, after my mother had kicked me out, several times for that matter, and only added to the problem i had. according to her, i was “crazy”, “just like my father” and “too much for her to deal with”. you see, she has been heavily addicted to opiates since before i left to college, which was 2007, so over a decade. when i left, she was still my mother, still mostly there. then over the years i was in school in galveston, it deteriorated. she only came to visit a handful of times and almost never called. the times she came, it was when i found pills for her. she’d say that she would stay a few days, but never would. the second those opiates hit her hand, she’d make an excuse and be out the door. either i said something that upset her, or she had other things to attend to at home. i stayed there about 10 days total over that 4 year gap. when bradford was born, she came so strung out on opiates, she held my leg as i pushed up above my head while scoot and i reminded her over and over to keep it even with him. she made my birth absolutely miserable. she wouldn’t stop ranting the whole time about herself and all that made the ungrateful one miserable. i just wanted my mom, and a peaceful birth with a healthy baby. after he came, she over took her oxycontin once again, and kept face-planting her sandwich while i was trying to learn how to breast feed. drooling on herself, intermittently ranting about herself and everyone that’s wronged her in-between. thanks mom. 
	after that, i started working for the navy. i had to return often to get her more pills, and more for myself as well. i was heavily addicted at the time. as according to her, everything in life is terrible, and every person you meet will only do you wrong. we will all die alone and nothing is worth living for. i believed that until october 2015. i had a psychological break out to sea off the coast of florida working for the naval oceanographic office. i was heavily smoking spice at the time, a horrid-for-a-fake weed, yet it was legal. i couldn’t smoke real weed as i had said job. i ran out early on my deployment and the withdrawals threw me into instant psychosis. i thought i saw alien life and talked to god (even though i was heavily athiest at the time). i ended up being kicked off the boat and abandoned on the coast of florida, my navy guide never showed. i some how made it to a hospital where i tried to communicate what had happened. they knocked me out with benzos and the next thing i know, there’s a pen in my hand to sign my outtake paperwork, which said i was on drugs the night prior i was fine. i immediately went into the first panic attack i remember. i found my way out of the hospital and almost walked into a bus. i sat down in the bus station that was there, trying to calm down. a dread-headed man named mario noticed my plight. and he told me it’s going to be ok, you just need some weed. i said i would love that and elaborated more on the situation at hand. he instantly picked up the phone and called his friend, a woman cab driver to get us both. she came and i jumped in without hesitation. he told her to head to the crib, she said no problem. she offered me a cigarette, and i cried. it was the first menthol i’ve had in a month, my favorite kind. i was on a shit before hand, neglecting myself and every human crave i had, medicating with the dumbest substance known to man. we headed to the streets of florida, arriving at mario’s house. he quickly returned with a blunt. and we ceremoniously smoked it. it was the best mind set i had been in in years. these people cared, about me, a complete stranger, and shared what little they had with me. just like the bc crew of the past. where i met my soulmate, darin, but was oblivious to it until 2016.

Some questions about meds + diagnosis,"currently i'm being treated with two antipsychotics; aripiprazole and quetiapine but i'm feel uneasy being on two aps especially as both have caused heart-related issues in the past.

i recently restarted quetiapine and already feel bigger :(, though it's eased my paranoid/psychotic-type symptoms.

so i was wondering if anyone here is being treated with one ap and a mood stabiliser? i know all meds have side effects but i'm hoping mood stabilisers may be more weight neutral (??)

does anyone have experience on aps + mood stabilisers?

also i'm not 100% bpd is my only sole psychiatric issue (due to how i was diagnosed + how i've responded and acted to meds), what would you say are some good open-ended ways to get your mh team to listen / hopefully re-evaluate my presentation?

"Been off quetiapine for a while now, thought I had misdiagnosed ADHD/ASD, things are getting bad again.","late last year i was diagnosed with adhd/asd as an adult. there were some suspicion over whether or not my bpd symptoms were misdiagnosed/unchecked adhd/asd, so my gp took me off quetiapine and put me on anti-depressants.

it's been a few months, my mental health is deteriorating. i didn't notice, or maybe i didn't want to notice, that everything's going bad again. i can't stop spiralling. i can't stop having breakdowns over the tiniest thing. i can't shut up when i start venting. i can't stop raising my voice and crying every other day. 

it's getting worse than it has ever been before. i don't know how i didn't notice until now. i never used to hit things, i never used to pull out my hair. i never used to be so undone that i can't physically stop myself from bruising and scratching the skin off my entire arm. i can't physically stop myself from crying and screaming for days at a time. i can't physically bring myself out of bed until 1 or 2 in the afternoon. i'm so stuck in my own head and my own pain that i can't see that i'm scaring my partner with my reckless outbursts. she's never seen me like this. i've never seen myself like this. i can't recognize who i am anymore when i look in the mirror, if i look too hard, i'm scared i'll see a reflection of my abusive ex. i'm scared i'll see my partner look at me with the same fear she used to look at her abusive exes with. i want to smash every mirror. i can't look at my so in the eyes. i can't hear myself think over all the screaming insecurities. i can't stop myself from speaking just for the sake of getting a reaction. i can't stop thinking about tearing my own throat out.

I just need to rant about my now ex,"this is a lot. you don’t have to read this. i just need to get my thoughts out. 

this year started out shit. it was already shit since last march whenever my seroquel wasn’t getting filtered out through my kidneys because i was taking creatine and in turn that started giving me seizures. i didn’t figure out it was the meds until july and then i had to stop taking them. i started dating my ex in november oh the year before and i was the most stable i’ve ever been in my life and super happy with her then it all got fucked up. those seizures made me scared to go to sleep, i’m still scared to sleep sometimes because it felt like i was actually dying. i had to take xanax to make them atop. i thought i was developing a panic disorder but no it was the meds. my illness gradually got worse and it really affected our relationship. i became distant and she got freaked out. my first split eventually came and what followed was our first break up. i don’t really remember anything up until october or november. all i know is that i was miserable and taking burspirone and trileptal. burspirone made emotionless and void. i wanted to get hit by a car so i could feel something but i was glad i wasn’t feeling anything for a while and i wasn’t have seizures or cause someone i love to freak out over something i’d do. i eventually got 2 amazing therapists in october as well. i started to feel a little better and talk to her more. we’d talk, she’d bring up how badly i’d made her feel and i said i wouldn’t be that way anymore and that i was going to fix everything and it could all go back to the way things were in march. but it would be a process and i’d make mistakes. i made a mistake and she would instantly jump on it and i’d feel terrible we’d both say nasty things to each other and then i’d stop talking to her. november was our longest break and i finally saw her again the week of my birthday. she gave me a twin peaks (the show) mug and we got to a point where i smashed it and cut my arm open on a piece of ceramic but only slightly because she stopped me. we stopped talking after that. i saw her again at a club she knows i go to and she knows is my special place i like to go to for me and dancing is one of my biggest forms of self care. i try to ignore her but i can’t. i can’t stop thinking about how badly i’ve treated her and all that i’ve done to not just her but everyone in my life. i end up going to my car and she calls me. she comes to see me in my car and then she starts screaming at me and she says “i wish you were dead” which she denies saying anytime i brought it up. i go into the center console and complete the job of what i could do 3 weeks earlier and cut my arm open. one of her friends got his jacket and wrapped it around my arm while the ambulance came and i asked her to come with me. i was released from the hospital on january 7th with an upper dose of trileptal and started on remeron. we stopped taking for a bit shortly after. i reached out again a couple weeks later. we kept going back and forth. same shit different month. why do we keep going back to each other? are we fucking masochists? we really started talking again. in april or may, she moved to another city close by that she always wanted to move to which is fine. i thought the distance would be good for us for a bit, i could do school and therapy here and she could do work and have all her college friends over there. cue last month i started splitting hard because she keeps bringing up everything i do wrong. i feel like she’s going to leave, we argue, nothing constructive happens, i start talking to other girls and she finds out. almost cut myself again. she stops it. from that moment things were just not good at all. it felt like she hated me and she only wanted to be with me to hate me more. i kept asking her “why do you hate me” i kept explaining to her why i was keeping her at arms length, what my defense mechanism are and why i do them but it only hurts her. the hurt turns to anger. everything always turns into anger. i’ve gotten really good about being aware of my emotions and toning them down and not exploding in an argument. she tells me i’m yelling whenever i’m really not and when i tell her she’s yelling at me when she actually is she just gets more angry. i can’t ever be what she wants me to be and she can’t see any bit of progress that i have. it has to be her way and it has to happen now. i honestly think that if i even became perfect she’d still resent me. as of right now i could have corona, i got tested and told her she might want to get tested and to quarantine. i tried talking to her like everything was fine like i normally do. like why is that such a bad thing, why does she have to make it a point that every time i reach back out again i talk like nothings happened, yes i’m aware of what happened and i just want to move on and try again. how else would i act. when you send me long multi paragraph texts explain to me how you feel. and you word it in ways to wear i can’t give input because it’s all on you and you know how i feel about everything. why are you surprised when i say “i don’t know how to respond to this” she tells me to stop talking to her and then keep sending me messages over and over. calls me, emails me. tells me i’m manipulative when all i do is tell her how i feel. when i tell her i’m not doing one thing and she’s doing something i’m gaslighting. she told me she’d find the next girl i talk to and tell her everything i’ve done to her. i’m so tired. we signed a lease we were going to move in. why am i so dumb. she doesn’t think she has bpd or some personality disorder even though she’s a lot like me. she has an anxiety disorder. this could be all her disorder making everything more extreme, she did just change meds. i need to just move on with my life i can’t keep doing this shit anymore.",1592896798,False,BPD,2020-06-23 07:19:58,"I just need to rant about my now ex this is a lot. you don’t have to read this. i just need to get my thoughts out.

started splitting hard because she keeps bringing up everything i do wrong. i feel like she’s going to leave, we argue, nothing constructive happens, i start talking to other girls and she finds out. almost cut myself again. she stops it. from that moment things were just not good at all. it felt like she hated me and she only wanted to be with me to hate me more. i kept asking her “why do you hate me” i kept explaining to her why i was keeping her at arms length, what my defense mechanism are and why i do them but it only hurts her. the hurt turns to anger. everything always turns into anger. i’ve gotten really good about being aware of my emotions and toning them down and not exploding in an argument. she tells me i’m yelling whenever i’m really not and when i tell her she’s yelling at me when she actually is she just gets more angry. i can’t ever be what she wants me to be and she can’t see any bit of progress that i have. it has to be her way and it has to happen now. i honestly think that if i even became perfect she’d still resent me. as of right now i could have corona, i got tested and told her she might want to get tested and to quarantine. i tried talking to her like everything was fine like i normally do. like why is that such a bad thing, why does she have to make it a point that every time i reach back out again i talk like nothings happened, yes i’m aware of what happened and i just want to move on and try again. how else would i act. when you send me long multi paragraph texts explain to me how you feel. and you word it in ways to wear i can’t give input because it’s all on you and you know how i feel about everything. why are you surprised when i say “i don’t know how to respond to this” she tells me to stop talking to her and then keep sending me messages over and over. calls me, emails me. tells me i’m manipulative when all i do is tell her how i feel. when i tell her i’m not doing one thing and she’s doing something i’m gaslighting. she told me she’d find the next girl i talk to and tell her everything i’ve done to her. i’m so tired. we signed a lease we were going to move in. why am i so dumb. she doesn’t think she has bpd or some personality disorder even though she’s a lot like me. she has an anxiety disorder. this could be all her disorder making everything more extreme, she did just change meds. i need to just move on with my life i can’t keep doing this shit anymore.",need rant ex lot don’t read need get thought year started shit already shit since last march whenever seroquel wasn’t getting filtered

my name is cal maddox, 26, male, uk. i was diagnosed with bpd nearly 2 years ago now, but i've been suffering with symptoms since i was a child.

i just wondered if anybody else suffers with night terrors, almost like flashbacks? sometimes i go days without sleep just because i'm terrified of what i'll see and experience when i fall asleep.

i have been prescribed quetiapine, venlafaxine and clonazepam. i've got to be honest though, besides being knocked out by the quetiapine, i do t really feel any other benefit to taking those pills.

any advice would be great!

Psychotic Depression,"!!!!!!!! cw: suici*e

hi! do any of happen to suffer from psychotic depression? i'd like to hear about the symptoms and thought patterns it might cause.

*for the rest of the post i'll just describe my situation. if you wish, you can just answer the question above, and not read the rest *   🍍

i'm 23f, diagnosed with bpd, severe (&amp;chronic) mdd with no psychotic symptoms, and an unspesified eating disorder. (would also most likely qualify for a diagnosis of complex ptsd but that disorder is not recognized officially in my country yet)
i have massive attachment issues and fear of both physical and emotional closeness and intimacy 👑

i'm currently on bupropion, zoloft (sertraline) and a low dose of quetiapine (for sleep mostly).

i currently don't have appropriate access to a psychiatrist since my country's public healthcare is seriously underfunded and i cant afford private ones. so it has been a minute since i've talked to a professional. that's mostly why i'm on reddit asking this stuff again lol. 

so. i'm very depressed.  so deeply depressed my legs and arms and head often feel so heavy i feel like i can't move. i'm so consumed by this endless feeling that everything is thoroughly meaningless. i can't shake the feeling, i constantly try to combat it with logic and reasoning but i can't, really. i always end up thinking i'm just deceiving myself to avoid the unpleasant reality.

i'm often puzzled by most other people: they clearly seem to find a lot of meaning in life, getting into relationships and having kids and advancing their careers and planning their future etc. going through a lot of hardship just to continue living. as i observe people i mostly feel fascinated and confused. i don't know what it is that they find valuable about existing. it's almost like there is a secret that most other people know and i don't, i'm for some reason left out of the club.
 it's like being invited to a place at a very spesific time and once you arrive you have no idea why you needed to be there, yet for everyone else it seems to be perfectly clear what they're supposed to do and why.

so at this point, maybe you're asking: are you suicidal? and, well, yes. of course. but not acutely. i'm chronically suicidal, so suicide is ""always on the menu"" .

i spend most of my time either angry or afraid. mostly afraid. i'm so insanely afraid of a ""catastrophe"". i don't know what it (the catastrophe) is. i just can't let go of the idea that the world is full of dangers i am not equipped to handle and it's just a matter of time that i will be crushed. because i'm fundamentally weaker than most people and i was just not built for this world. my survival was not intended to happen, it's unnatural and futile to try and change that. 

do these sound like psychotic thoughts to you? or just ptsd/bpd stuff? or maybe something else?

So do ya smoke weed or use prescriptions?,"i dunno how often this gets asked cause i'm stoned and can't check hahaha. weed is pretty much legal here, i've been smoking on and off about 12 years or so. sometimes more sometimes less. lately i'm doing good with life and working and school but i often feel like i'm just tryin to get thru the days, and there's definitely room for improvement. but i'm a dumbass so i fucked around with a coworker and i've been smoking more than usual. and i don't know which i prefer, during the days i'm anxious and i can't concentrate on fuck all, but i'm daydreaming and fantasizing and i don't know if i trust any of those thoughts, they're good ones and bad ones and i don't know what to think or do. so i smoke a bunch of weed and my thoughts go to the exact opposite and i can just chill and sleep and i don't have to feel what i'm feeling or give a shut about anything. but i guess i still don't trust my thoughts much so i'm not sure if this is better or worse. 

i've gotta go back to counselling, i thought i was doing better. but i wonder about meds, anti anxieties anyone? i've been on seroquel and ativan in the past but honestly i felt the same way about all of it, not sure which is better or worse. i think i'm better without the seroquel, but i wonder about anti anxieties. though to be honest the ativan never did fuck all for me so i never took it often, cause i don't wanna have to take a shitload all the time.

"Is this just a ""nicer description"" for BPD?","so i originally went to get help about 4 months ago for ongoing depression (sadness, no interests, no motivation, emptyness wtc) and the extreme moods that also came up during summer last year. at first i thought of bipolar 2 because i had 2 weeks cycles of deep depression and feeling more active. those went away after i got seroquel to sleep. (i dont get any ssri unless i really ask for, at one point i shouldve gotten escitalopram but got denied because of being suicidal.) 

anyways i went the way to be an inpatient for a diagnosis (didn't really get one but to that later) i checked myself out after 2 days. i dissociated so much there, couldn't sleep at all and took me a week to feel somewhat normal in my flat again. 
i haven't told anyone besides my boyfriend about my dissociation and loss of self yet, because it embarrasses me and i have a legit feel to not be taken seriously when i tell that to the docs/ being put on more antipsychotics? since im not suffering a loss of reality, everything just weird.

so my ""diagnosis"" came down to depressive spectrum (which is bs in my opinion, i had deathwishes since i was 12, its way more severe), that i have problems with my moods and how to deal with them (drinking when its too much and self harm) and to find my personality or smth. 
this kinda sounds like bpd to me.
 i'm lowkey not willing to continue going to this clinic/docs anymore because i'm not being taken very seriously there.

i've been trying to help him for many years. we've gone through many stages. 
always hoping for a better future for all of us. but, my friend's problem is related to a health condition, he has bpd and at the moment he is not able to access care at all... he finds a real outlet in the fact that he is using, thereby altering his life and his problems.i'm constantly reminding him of what really matters. what's out there. outside pain and drugs and it's killing me. he tells me he understands. 
but makes no effort. 

the first thing he does when the day starts is take a line. after a few hours, he can barely stand, and is about to fall at any moment to the bottom of his chair. i've told him several times that it's not normal. that it's not healthy for him. that he should get involved in different activities. more words and actions that do not match. he is my best friend, my lover, we've known each other for eight years and we have many projects in common. i don't want to give up this relationship, but right now it makes me so unhappy. i feel trapped.",1590122893,False,BPD,2020-05-22 04:48:13,"Drugs / friendship. hi everyone!

"bad break up, but he's sticking around while I get help. I feel terrible and confused.","tl dr: moved out and broke up 5 months ago, i have attempted to destroy his life and mine, he is now willing to stick by until i'm stable. i feel this may be a terrible idea, but really don't want to lose him. talk some sense into me. 

i keep writing a damn venting novel so i'm going to try to be more brief and spare you the major details. 

i'm a 30f, been struggling with some issues for awhile now. was diagnosed with bpd as a teen, and have been untreated mostly since my early 20s. slowly declining over the past few years, and have recently full on lost my shit. i am being treated now with seroquel, therapy, and started dbt last week. 

i met this boy, 28m, in september of 2013. we moved states last july, and i moved out of our shared apartment last december. i am the one that broke it off. he immediately, before me moving out, began doing the online dating thing. 

the thought of him with another women kills me. straight up gets under my skin and makes me want to rip myself apart. 

i have been trying to destroy him. i gave him herpes, which he knew i had from day one, but did not contract until going down on me after breaking up. i was not having an outbreak, and did not do that on purpose at least. this limits his dating pool significantly. i have interfered with every girl he has met, and most that he has been able to contact on std specific dating sites and other wise. i have made fake dating profiles and a fake facebook with his image. the honest intent was to get every 'dating' female in seattle to see his face and attribute a dickish, pretty boy, asshole with it. 

i started basic therapy in january, seroquel about a month ago, and dbt a week ago. i deleted his last fake online profile about 2 weeks ago. 

i have slashed his tires, deleted his tumblr, messaged every female or potenital female he has ever used his phone or internet services to contact, cut his cable cord, called the cops on him for bullshit, accused him of bullshit, stalked him, called his work an unreasonable number of times, in general contacted him a very unreasonable number of times using a variety of methods. i am the psycho bpd ex they warn guys about. 

i really don't want to down play how terrible i have been/am to him. he's lashed out a few times, but generally has stayed relatively calm and patient. i feel like he's using me though cause i'll pretty much do anything for that boy, and he knows that. except lose my obsession over him or gain some serious stabilty, cause that shit seems really hard at the moment. i also don't know if my mind is making that explanation up or not regardless of truth.  

we broke up in december, it is mid april. i have lasted one week during no contact. he responded. i beg him to not leave me. i use every trick in the book to make him not leave me. everytime he says he's finally going to block me or get a restraining order i feel like my soul is actually this little spiny film on my skin and something is ripping it away from me. 

now he says he'll stay and help me. the mood stabilizers are great. so many things also suck about them, but the fact that i have only wanted to seriously kill myself twice the past two weeks is awesome. i feel like a turd, but a somewhat stable turd. 

anyway, now that i am getting a little better, he is getting a little nicer. he is super clear about not wanting to be in a relationship with me, but also not pursuing other females for an extended period of time. let me write this once more just to help it sink in: he is super clear about this being temporary and not in any way a romantic or potentially long term or serious relationship. he still fucks me. i cry a lot though when he does, but not because i don't want him to, but because i really need some serious fucking help. 

so, i'm getting help, and it is making little impacts that feel so huge right now. thing is, i really don't want to walk away from him, but holy shit this isn't healthy. or could it be? i mean, i don't trust a damn thing my head is thinking lately, especially with regards to this boy. 

i dream of the life we could build together, i dream that we can make each other happy.... we can't though, and we don't. 

i was pretty convinced i needed to die last friday and i asked him to block me. sometimes i don't know how suicidal i actually am. you know, bought a gun but couldn't pull the trigger. i don't think, even in my darkest moments, that i ever could have or would pull the trigger. sometimes the idea of death is comforting, it's so peaceful in theory. also, really boring. 

he wouldn't block me, instead he said as long as i didn't cut or drink, and i went to therapy and took my meds (i'm pretty committed to not feeling like this any more or ever again so that's not an issue) we could go backpacking or climbing this weekend. shit that makes me happy, he would help me go out and do the shit that makes me happy. thing is, what happens if he doesn't follow through like usual, what if i find out that he is talking to another person, what if so many things. 

i don't want to walk away from him, and i still imagine that we could really help each other, but now the more rational side of me says that's bullshit.

we broke up in december, it is mid april. i have lasted one week during no contact. he responded. i beg him to not leave me. i use every trick in the book to make him not leave me. everytime he says he's finally going to block me or get a restraining order i feel like my soul is actually this little spiny film on my skin and something is ripping it away from me. 

now he says he'll stay and help me. the mood stabilizers are great. so many things also suck about them, but the fact that i have only wanted to seriously kill myself twice the past two weeks is awesome. i feel like a turd, but a somewhat stable turd. 

anyway, now that i am getting a little better, he is getting a little nicer. he is super clear about not wanting to be in a relationship with me, but also not pursuing other females for an extended period of time. let me write this once more just to help it sink in: he is super clear about this being temporary and not in any way a romantic or potentially long term or serious relationship. he still fucks me. i cry a lot though when he does, but not because i don't want him to, but because i really need some serious fucking help. 

so, i'm getting help, and it is making little impacts that feel so huge right now. thing is, i really don't want to walk away from him, but holy shit this isn't healthy. or could it be? i mean, i don't trust a damn thing my head is thinking lately, especially with regards to this boy. 

i dream of the life we could build together, i dream that we can make each other happy.... we can't though, and we don't. 

i was pretty convinced i needed to die last friday and i asked him to block me. sometimes i don't know how suicidal i actually am. you know, bought a gun but couldn't pull the trigger. i don't think, even in my darkest moments, that i ever could have or would pull the trigger. sometimes the idea of death is comforting, it's so peaceful in theory. also, really boring. 

he wouldn't block me, instead he said as long as i didn't cut or drink, and i went to therapy and took my meds (i'm pretty committed to not feeling like this any more or ever again so that's not an issue) we could go backpacking or climbing this weekend. shit that makes me happy, he would help me go out and do the shit that makes me happy. thing is, what happens if he doesn't follow through like usual, what if i find out that he is talking to another person, what if so many things. 

i don't want to walk away from him, and i still imagine that we could really help each other, but now the more rational side of me says that's bullshit.

"As of today, I (F27) am no longer a patient in the community mental health service/psychiatric system after 4 years!","hey guys!

yesterday i had my last therapy session in the psychiatric system after being a patient since 2016.
it is both scary, parts of me doesn't feel ready but a bigger part of me, is actually damn proud and thankful for the fact, that i haven developed so incredibly much and that the professionals think i am not that sick anymore.
before seeing a psychiatrist, i was treated by a psychologist for what she believed was *generalised anxiety, panic disorder and ocd* and we mainly worked with cognitive behavioural therapy. i was feeling very unwell and she wanted me to see a psychiatrist and hopefully receive medical treatment.

i have been through a lot in the system, here's the story short.

1. seeing a private psychiatrist, who first treated me for major depression and anxiety. i started antidepressants and that triggered, what the psychiatrist thought was a hypomanic episode and i was diagnosed with *bipolar*. then i started treatment with quetiapine without any significant change and he wanted to start me on lithium, but i wasn't feeling safe so i needed to move on in the system.

2.  then i became a patient in the community mental health service. here i was treated by some not so competent doctors and a nurse. they started me for instance on valproate without any effect. they wanted me clarified for borderline, but a specialised psychologist, cleared me very quickly for borderline - ""you are way too healthy in your mind to have borderline""

3. after the unsuccessful diagnosing, the local community mental services send me on to the specialised unit for affective disorders in my county. it was a very underwhelming experience, only diagnosing with a psychiatrist and no supportive talks or therapy. i became more and more ill.

4. i called the acute psychiatric clinic a lot at this time, fall 2017, and was a patient in their acute team some weeks and in december 2017 i had a 10 day long admission to a psychiatric hospital, where i was severely depressed. he cleared out my diagnoses again and diagnosed me, besides *bipolar*, with *borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder*

5. after the admission, i got back into the local psychiatric clinic, this time again with an incompetent nurse, no therapy and i was miserable. at this time i started seeing a specialised psychologist in psychiatry and he wasn't content with my treatment,so he helped me on in the system.

7. the last stop on my journey through the danish psychiatric system, started two years ago. i was being declared ready for therapy, targeted on my borderline diagnosis. i started with some psychoeducation, medicine adjustments (many of them) and then a year of mentalisation based group therapy. the group therapy ended in november and i had individual therapy sessions with my two therapists, with the last ever session yesterday. the psychiatrist at the clinic decided to remove my bipolar diagnosis, because she thinks my problems are all related to my personality disorder(s).

when i started group therapy in november 2018, i was very sick. i had a lot of suicidal ideation, head banging, i couldn't hold eye contact, i was hopeless, despondent, felt badly treated, left alone, let down. i was a victim. i seeked other's protection all the time and was helpless. i was sure i would shatter, if i was left alone. 
in may 2019, my ex boyfriend of 8 years left me because of my mental health problems. in september 2019, my beloved mum died.
and besides this, which my therapists thought would crush me... i am standing on my own two feet.

i am living alone for the first time ever and it is going so well. my suicidal ideation is almost gone. i am having better days more frequently and it is easier for me, to drag myself up again, when i fall. self harm is at a bare minimum. i am capable of mentalising.
i am in a relationship with a wonderful woman who actually also has borderline (+ schizophrenia), but we are so good together.
i still have somewhat severe mood swings, and i can have days, where i am very depressed, but i have learned to go softer on my self and be more accepting and loving.
i have been out of job for three years but slowly but surely, i am soon ready to start working again. i am not a victim anymore.
my therapists are so extremely proud of me and my process and they got both goosebumps and tears in their eyes, when we said goodbye yesterday.

i am not completely well. i still have issues. i still have a lot of work to do. but i am better than in several years and damn, i am so proud.

recovery is possible. i have seen rock bottom, but we can get our lives back.
we can get better.

Medication for BPD,"has anyone had any success with medications for bpd?  i'm currently on lamotragine, seroquel, effexor and stilnox (ambien).  it's hard to know if it's working or not (except for the stilnox for sleep) as i've only been on them for about two months and i'm still struggling with self harm and obsessive suicidal thoughts.

i'm currently in inpatient care.  i saw my psychiatrist today (who doesn't know me particularly well as she's not my regular psychiatrist).  she told me to have a think about the medications i'm on over the weekend and if i think they're helping or not, and i want to continue taking them.  i can't discuss it with my current psychiatrist as she is a public health psychiatrist who only works two days per week - thursdays and fridays, and she's hard to get a hold of as she's so busy.  

my clinical manager is quite strongly against medication.  she says the lamotragine is for bipolar and seroquel for psychosis - neither of which i have.  it seems, from the evidence base, that there are no proven, effective medications for bpd, and we're going into it blind - just hoping something works.  

i do have agitated depression ie. i function enough to get out of bed each day - actually i can't stand being in bed - i often need to get up and do something just to keep the depression and anxiety at bay.  but sometimes that manifests itself in not so helpful ways as well. and i feel the depression is strongly related to the despair of not being able to manage my bpd symptoms.  

i've tried dbt, however i was asked to 'take a break' as i was still self harming for the duration of the program. the program was also run through my community health team so no coaching was available outside of office hours.

it's really hard to know whether the medication is helping or not.  i don't feel great on it, but i don't feel worse on it either. 

anyway, has anyone had experience with these meds or others that they think will help?

This borderline episode is getting out of hand so quickly,"my borderline has always been a struggle, and it's something i've constantly been aware of. but the past few months it's become a literal everyday fight. at the start of this year i finally tapered off my antidepressant after over 6 years. everything was fine until a couple months later. i started losing my mind. the most intense mood swings i've ever had, crippling paranoia, complete emptiness, i'm splitting so bad especially when it comes to my boyfriend. i called my psych &amp; told her i needed to go back on my meds asap. it's been about 2 months now and i feel the exact same. the past couple weeks it's been getting worse every single day. i've been having breakdowns to my boyfriend &amp; my brain is telling me he doesn't love me anymore &amp; that he's found someone else. i've been using even more. i feel disgusting about myself &amp; have fallen into a pattern of disordered eating. i've lost about 15lbs in the past 3 or 4 weeks. i'm trying so, so hard to resist sh, but i'm starting to crack.

a little background, im 22. still at my first year of college after dropping out like 3 other schools.

on summer i was on sertraline and my mood was a little maniac, couldnt concentrate, i was always on the move and didnt think about food. dropped around 10 lbs during summer.

my psyquiatrist then prescribed me velafaxine and everything sucked. literally sucked.
couldnt make it out of bed, slept 15 hours straight and couldnt do much of my life. stopped training and eating healthy and started binge eating everything i could.

im up the 10 lbs now, and even though im not fat, i feel awful about myself. stopped taking the velafaxine and now im on quetiapine and risperidone.

Major depression with strong borderline traits and poor coping mechanisms,"anyone else initially diagnosed similarly who eventually got diagnosed with bpd officially?

emergency psychiatrist said ""he doesn't like labels,"" and that even though i do fit a lot of the criteria, he is reluctant to to label because of bias in the medical community, risk of not getting good care with that diagnosis on my chart, and having not seen me before.

i've not seen this psychiatrist before, nor any others on the emerg because i have not taken myself there before.

my psych nurse who hooked me up with a dbt program, and recommended i go to emerg because of my self harm, etc had initially used that phrase too ""bpd traits.""

i'm not label chasing, but i do find them helpful. i struggled for a long time to get help with my pain issues, and when i finally got diagnosed with fibromyalgia it opened up a lot of doors to treatment and accommodation at work. i felt very validated to finally have something to point to, and make my pain issues realer to my family.

he has put me on prozac and seroquel in addition to my already prescribed wellbutrin. he also said that even with that label, my treatment plan would be the same. i am effectively being treated as if i do have bpd, but without a definitive label. it feels frustrating, but shouldn't i just be happy that i have a better treatment plan ahead of me and new meds to try?

Asking boyfriend (46 m) of three years refuses to participate in my therapy.,"i’m 37f and i’ve been in dbt treatment for a a year and eight months. i’ve been on lithium and seroquel for five years. i’ve been in recovery from alcoholism in aa for three years. 

there has been a vast change in my life in this time. one area i continue to struggle is in my relationship. sensing or experiencing abandonment and social media attention from women are two areas that set me off and when i say set me off, i experience a trigger that inspires a fear so strong that it releases adrenaline and the fight or flight response with an intensity that doesn’t allow me the buffer moment to choose to access my skills. not even tipp which is designed for these moments. i fly off the handle and say horrible things and threaten to leave and i just lose all self-control. 

at this point. i’m ready to consider all areas. possibly it is a medication issue where an upped dosage of my lithium or the addition of some medication used to treat intermittent rage that works to slow that response when triggered. and i am wanting my partner to join me in therapy not because i expect him to walk on eggshells or that he necessarily needs to change anything he is doing. i just feel i could benefit from support in addressing these issues and him to be in on the process i am going through. i feel like i could benefit from him being present at my psychiatrist appointment to weigh in and help me consider pros and cons of medication changes. 

i know that my recovery is my responsibility. and i know i am responsible to recover regardless of who is and isn’t in my life. does it make sense that i am desiring his involvement at this time? or is it just more bpd clingy nonsense? i don’t trust my own perceptions and desires at this point and that is painful. i intuit something such as this, and then immediately second guess it. 

what if he says no? i’ve mentioned it and he says he has been in therapy with women in the past and all that happens is he is told what to do and the focus is on him. i explained that this isn’t therapy for him, but for me, as someone who accepts responsibility for her diagnosis and is seeking solutions, and that he is just there to balance my perspective, learn, and give feedback and support. he is “thinking about it” currently. 

what if he tells me he doesn’t want to be involved? that’s going to hurt. does this mean i need to rethink my involvement with him if, under the context i’ve described, he refuses to engage in this with me, after being together this amount of time?

Has anybody successfully tapered off a high Seroquel dose after long-term use?

my doctor suggested i lower the dose by 50mg every month. for a few days after i lowered my dose i felt ok, but for a week or 2 after that i was having pretty noticeable mood swings / volatile behavior and a lot of trouble concentrating at work. my next decrease in dose is scheduled october 8th.

What drug(s) have worked for you?,"i just spent 2 months on 2.5mg abilify that i took at bedtime. it was working great for me. apart from the drowsyness, i felt more level, my sleep patterns were regular and i was feeling happy and productive. i was even finding insight into things i didn't understand before. my therapist and i thought this was the one! 

the last 3 weeks have been hell: blurred vision while driving at night, heavy drowsyness (always sleepy, needing frequent naps), confusion, mask like expression of the face, extreme anxiety, depression, cutting (one cut, one time...first time in many years) and suicidal thoughts. i'm currently trying to ween myself off by cutting the dose down to 1.25mg for a week or so.

i just saw my family doctor today (well the lady who's filling in while he's on vacay) and she prescribed me 25mg daily of seroquel for 1 week and then move to 50mg daily. i'm not sure if i'm going to take it. it sounds pretty scary from what i've read on here. 

maybe an ssri?? i'm so lost :(

after reading many stories on here i'd love more insight...what drug(s) do you use, have you used? what amount do you take? do they work? what benefits and/or side effects have you experienced?

[Serious/Advice] Should I start taking my prescription for seroquel XR? I'm dreading going back to work again.,"hey everyone,

i've been off work for depression and gad. i also have bpd.

i've been prescribed seroquel xr and i haven't taken it yet because i'm afraid of the side affects and i'm going to be trying to have a baby in april. i'm considering starting it now because just the thought of working gets me close to crying now. i have a job interview tomorrow. whenever i work i always feel inferior and stupid and i feel as though everyone thinks i'm a basket case with major issues. it always leads me to quit because i end up thinking everyone thinks i'm terrible at my job. 

how do i cope with this? will the medication help enough? i was on it before but i didn't like what the prozac did. i'm afraid i'll be unbalanced. last time i started them i was aggressive for a bit.

i'm on a list for therapy but it'll only be in a year and in the meantime i can't afford private.

"Schizoaffective BPD here changing meds to stop weight gain, need some advice","hey guys, hope everyone is doing well. 

just needed some advice on my medication please. 
recently i have put on about 20kgs and gone from a size 4 au to a size 12 au and i’ve seen my doctor about changing my medication as it’s causing terrible sugar and carb cravings for me. 

i have been on seroquel 400mgs with prozac 20mgs and am honestly the happiest i’ve been in my life, aside from the really upsetting weight gain which i just can’t cope with. 

the doctor has changed me to latuda 80mgs in hope that the food cravings (which were insanely difficult to live with, just hungry all of the time) will go away. 

they have subsided almost completely, however i’m struggling with my emotions again and having difficulty pushing away delusional thoughts and triggers. plus it’s making me super nauseous and i throw up every time i take it 🙄

my question is, do i push through or just go back to being happy and unhealthy/uncomfortable?
will a higher dose be better for me? i have a feeling i’m already on the highest dose. 

very scared i’m going to go into psychosis again.

(hyperventilating led to that and numbness all over and i fainted in the ambulance) however, self-harm and substance abuse and depersonalization and derealization were regarded as bpd things. the fact that i've been diagnosed with major depression at 13 and that high or normal and depressive periods were cyclic for 10 years (i'm going to be 23 in a month) points towards bipolar. bpd was not even considered until a year or so ago, but then again i had no official diagnosis following my major depression episode when i was younger. i was just seeing a psychiatrist and taking meds. when i was 17 my father brought up bpd to the psychiatrist i was seeing for hormone therapy and we went over the symptoms together and she was adamant that i didn't have it.

"Off my meds for 2 weeks, feels like months","the psychiatrist i see is far away, she doesn't take insurance, and she doesn't know how to deal with my trans identity, so i made an appointment with a shrink at my university. well, i was supposed to go to said appointment today, but i've been off my meds for two weeks, including seroquel which i was dependent on for years to sleep, so i missed the appointment. i woke up at 4pm, realized i missed it (plus one of my classes), and was too anxious to call and reschedule. 

further, i'm scared to get back on seroquel because even though it helps me sleep, it makes me sleep too much. like 12-14 hours a day. and i wind up missing important things because i'm too sleepy.

when i don't have the seroquel, i sleep anywhere from 2-9 hours a day, usually falling asleep at 8am and waking up for whatever i need to do the next day. it's hell. i use weed at night to relax but it doesn't make me sleep. and don't get me started on melatonin, cough syrup, or any other otc sleep aids. they don't work. i should probably see a sleep specialist but like i said, the anxiety is too high to make appointments. the shrink comes first in my priorities.

I feel like I relapsed with impulse control.

like finally it kinda makes sense that i’ve been bingeing, purging and starving every other day. and finally it kinda makes sense that i have been sleeping with way too many strangers than my liking, taking way too much drugs to the verge of overdose, drinking way too much alcohol that i always would vomit literally all my guts after, shopping way too much that i kept running out of money... when i was being diagnosed by my psychiatrist, i felt like there’s this unknown figurative lock in my head has finally been discovered. 

since then, i’m on fluoxetine and quetiapine. and i was previously on venlafaxine for the past few years. on top of medications, i started seeing a new therapist too. because i desperately want to get better. i hate that i’m always in those intense and unhealthy romantic relationships, that i’ve never ever able to commit to a healthy romantic relationship with anyone at all. 

right now, i feel so alone. i was so alone to the point that i slept with a stranger yesterday. and i’ve been abstaining from one night stand since last august. :/ 

i’ve an extremely loving support system. however, they are all very far away from me (about average 13 hours flight away). i miss them a lot and i don’t know how to share with them my latest diagnosis. i was previously diagnosed with chronic depression and everyone in my support system knows about it. i am not very sure how to start this conversation with them. i really don’t know. i want to but i’m afraid to share.

Seroquel withdrawal due to pharmacy/insurance mistake,"seroquel is fairly new to my treatment and has helped with some really big aspects of my life. i've been able to make new friends with fewer problems, go to new places, and i'm even holding a job again, *finally*.

Quetiapine and weight gain,"has anyone had experience with this? 

i was prescribed quetiapine about a month ago while i was an inpatient on a psych ward and i'm seriously considering speaking to my psychiatrist about stopping.

i could deal with the grogginess, sleepiness, feeling meh but i don't think i can cope with the weight gain. before i got real bad in may i was going to the gym and eating clean despite everything and i'm not sure how much weight i lost but it was noticeable (after a year of letting myself go). i'd say easily 30-50lb. in the last month or so i've gained 10.

i'm not eating more than i was, if anything less as i haven't been drinking alcohol like i used to.  recently i can go one or two days and if someone didn't remind me i'd literally forget to eat. 

i'm just worried because 100% have body image issues and this weight gain is making me depressed and unmotivated and i feel like that will make me decline, even with extra meds.

Has seroquel been helpful for anyone? Quitting weed to try some medicine.,"just picked up new meds today.

i've been going to dbt group therapy full time all week and i've decided to quit smoking marijuana in order to try other medication. 

the marijuana was useful for my appetite, autoimmune issues, anxiety, sleep... but had no desired effect on my behaviors and mood. 

i have slowly cut out other drugs/ alcohol / junk foods / dairy / wheat and have seen a huge difference in my ibs.

honestly, quitting alcohol was much easier than marijuana. i'm like an angry baby with swollen joints, i can't sleep, my appetite is weird and i've been crying a shit ton. 

i'm ready to do whatever my program suggests and i'm hoping that maybe this will help with sleep and appetite and maybe some disassociation? 

i am also co-morbid with adhd &amp; ptsd, ibs.

just wondering if anyone's tried it out. i know everyone's body chemistry is completely different, but i've had really bad experiences with meds (mostly antidepressants) with awful side effects that's outshone anything helpful.

Just Discovered I Have BDP After Years Of Anguish,"i discovered i have bpd today. i'm kind of devastated and relieved at the same time. i've spent years going to terrible therapists, doctors that are ready to just write me a prescription for the incorrect meds and being admitted to wards to figure out my problems; only to be put on medications that made me feel like an even emptier shell of myself, like seroquel+abilify. i've been put on zoloft and other anti-depressants, but seroquel was the worst thing i've ever experienced. it made me extremely uneasy/jittery and like i had just woken up out of a 7 year coma.

anyway, my mother had me when she was 18 years old, (i was at her graduation). her relationship with her parents wasn't the greatest, and she was kicked out of her house around the time i was either about to be born, or had just been born. i'm pretty sure i inherited her anxiety. my biological father was a guitarist for some up and coming glam metal band in the 80's (and was actually pretty good from what i heard), but was a deadbeat. things like promising to take me to disneyland and never showing up. she had a friend from highschool, whom my middle name is taken from, who was basically head over heels for her and would help her take care of me when i was an infant, but apparently was forever friendzoned. i don't know their particular history, but i do very vaguely remember a series of abusive relationships from when i was extremely young where her boyfriend would beat the living shit out of her in front of me. apparently i was 4 years old when this happened, but i remember a man hitting my mom in the face a couple of times and then throwing a desk on top of her, and her jumping out of the bathroom window to get away, and the man stomping one of my plastic football helmets with his foot as he slammed the door open to chase after her. this story was confirmed by my mother who was astonished that i remembered, because why the hell would my mom reminisce with me about such a thing. i can still vividly remember the layout of that apartment and what it looked like, but nothing else.

to escape this reality, she married a man in the coastguard. my mother and i moved away from my family and were stationed 2 states away. eventually she got pregnant with my middle brother. coastguard man was also an extremely abusive military type, who believed in whipping his kids with a belt. fine. but he would hit my 6 year old ass like i was a grown man and it wasn't just a couple..it was very angry, almost as if he was getting off on it, repeatedly. my ass used to be so beat i couldn't sit down for hours. it was some of the worst pain i have ever felt in my life. i would have contusions on my buttocks (never in places people could see of course!). i was a child, i thought everybody got punished this way, so i never said anything. and this was for things like ""pouring water out of the tub when he told me not to"" or ""eating a piece of bologna without asking""..one time i actually poured water out of the tub one to many times (i was fucking 6), and he grabbed me so hard out of the tub it dislocated my arm. i wasn't taken to the hospital. i think he used to hit my mom too, but i can't confirm it. i did used to listen to him screaming at her on a daily basis. this went on for about 4 or 5 years, and is still something i think about on a daily basis. it happened 22 years ago. he would also do things like put on movies like full metal jacket, the x files and other things that would terrify any average 6 year old, and didn't mind me watching.
they eventually got divorced and he kicked my mother out of the house, and she was once again rebuilding from scratch. single bedroom apartment with no furniture. my brother and i were forced to stay with him while she got back on her feet. he favored my brother because he was his actual son, i was basically his whipping post to take his anger out about my mother. he went through a series of different relationships with women who had children and they would all pick on my younger brother, and i would always get my ass beat for defending him. i eventually got kicked out at age 9, by the man that used to hit me on a daily basis, for ""being too wild"". i was actually just defending my baby brother from these strange people filtering in and out of my life. my mother at this point had remarried and i moved back with them.

abusive coastguard man at this point was being restationed across the country to the opposite coast, which meant my baby brother was being taken away from me. he would always come visit during his school vacations, and it was always one of the happiest moments in my broken little families lives when he would come back. it was also the most heart breaking fucking moments i've ever experienced watching my 6 or 7 year old brother being escorted onto a plane across the country by an attendant.
my mom and his dad fought for custody for what seemed like forever and after 4 years or so of this back and forth, my brother became too much to handle for his dad and he finally agreed to let him come live with us. eventually my mom got pregnant with my youngest brother with her second husband, who is actually my adopted father, and things were finally starting to normalize.
i learned to kind of mask my pain by trying to make other people laugh, because it made me happy to see people happy, and i would tell jokes and immitate voices from cartoons and other shit like the movie preview guy.

fast forward to the (somewhat) present. i'm still learning what bpd actually is, but i wasn't the weird kid in school. i was a 4 year varsity letter scholar athlete in baseball. i was voted ""most desirable"" (lol right?) and ""class clown"" and all that shit that doesn't matter. i did extremely well (and still do) with girls.. and i surround myself with great friends. the problem is, sometimes it all feels really forced and fake. like i'm an empty shell just watching life from 3rd person. like all these great people don't really care. i have a woman that is truely in love with me, would do anything in the world for me, and i feel like ""she's doing it just to be nice"" or like ""i don't deserve it"".

i still feel resentment towards my mother for ""allowing"" these things to happen. i've felt so betrayed, wondering how you could ever let that happen to your child. i've talked with her about it but it usually ends up in her getting defensive. i went down and met my biological father and his family for the first time when i was 21. he's almost 50 and still lives at home with his mom. recovering meth addict, and his family was extremely weird, manipulative and tried to get me to ""side"" against my mother because she ""took me away from them"". they bought me a one way ticket to visit them, and made it seem like it was ""so i could come back whenever i wanted"", but had no intention of flying me back, and i eventually had to make my way home myself.

i have horrible anger issues but it hasn't gotten really bad until the last couple of years. it's mainly just me losing my shit and accidentally breaking keys off of my laptop and things of that nature, i could never harm somebody. i've never even been in a fight, but i've gotten really sick of having to replace my nice things because i couldn't get myself together..i'm generally extremely laid back, but if something sets me off, i go from 0-100 in seconds flat. i feel like fucking dr. jekyll and mr. hyde..

i'm extremely irritable when i'm around people i know i can just ""let it go"" around. most of the time i'm not even ranting or pissed off at these people, in my head i feel like my racing thoughts are pouring out, but it comes off as me yelling at them. i tend to raise my voice a lot when i feel i need to make a point or if i feel like i'm not being heard. my girlfriend has literally told me ""it's like you're two different people"". i have this ideation that i've caused so much anguish and stress in peoples lives, that they'd just be better off without my shitstorm. i can't ever just ""let things go"". i have a pretty large group of friends who all seem to genuinely enjoy my company, but if i ever feel like somebody is even making the slightest attempt to hurt me in any way, i lash out and immediately go for the jugular. i haven't been doing this as much, that's one of the few things i've been able to get a grip on, but sometimes it feels like i can't control the word vomit/me flipping me shit.

i went to college for graphic design/photography, but dropped out because i have this constant fear that i'll never be good enough. i'll mill over something that's pissed me off for days before i cool off. i don't have any freak outs in public or around anyone outside of my gf and immediate family, but i can feel my screws just turning. nobody else really has any idea what's going on with me, they all just think i'm cynical as fuck, which must get exhausting for them, too. i've just grown tired of feeling extremely sad, lonely and empty on the inside and pretending to be this happy go lucky dude who's telling jokes to mask how i really feel. like nobody understands me and like i'm going to suffer for the rest of my life. i used to drink to blackout to numb the pain until that eventually put me in the er from asphyxiation/alcohol poisoning. now i smoke shitloads of pot. i hate feeling like i need a crutch, but for the most part it helps me mellow out/sleep/eat normally.

i completely distrust doctors, because most of them have either just written prescriptions or weren't getting paid enough. i've never had a therapist make me feel like what i'm going through matters. i've had doctors in the ward straight up lie to my dad. it all feels so debilitating. on the outside i appear like a normal person, but on the inside i feel like a fucking freakshow. like every time i wake up it feels like ""here we go again..."". sometimes i feel like with the things that i have experienced and have seen, i should have turned out to be jeffrey dahmer or something. it's an extremely painful way to live, i've just turned 27 now and i feel extremely exhausted. like i've lived 80 years. but my younger brothers keep me going. everything else just doesn't feel like it's real anymore.
at least i've finally found the answer i've been searching for, for the last 10 or so years. i absolutely loathe that i've ""inherited"" this anxiety and intense anger from other peoples mistakes, but i guess everybody has got to start somewhere.",1411476337,False,BPD,2014-09-23 12:45:37,"Just Discovered I Have BDP After Years Of Anguish i discovered i have bpd today. i'm kind of devastated and relieved at the same time. i've spent years going to terrible therapists, doctors that are ready to just write me a prescription for the incorrect meds and being admitted to wards to figure out my problems; only to be put on medications that made me feel like an even emptier shell of myself, like seroquel+abilify. i've been put on zoloft and other anti-depressants, but seroquel was the worst thing i've ever experienced. it made me extremely uneasy/jittery and like i had just woken up out of a 7 year coma.

Recently diagnosed and learning to live with BPD...,"morning guys,

i thought i'd drop a post in here with my story - it's likely not too different to anyone else's but i need to talk about it, with others that understand...

whilst i have people in my life i can talk to about the way i feel, i think it's hard for them to understand the constant roller-coaster of emotions, thoughts and feelings. shit, it's hard for me to understand let alone friends and family who have witnessed me change into a different person.

just over a month ago (june 17th) i was diagnosed as having bpd by the local mental health authority, this came after a number of events of personal tradagy and self sabotage including my mother passing away at the end of 2019, extreme and prolonged stress from my previous employment, suicidal thoughts on a number of occasions due to romantic (or not so) situations including marriage breakdown and failed relationships there after, reckless behaviour endangering myself and others abusing alcohol, putting my career and lively hood at risk... man, who am i?

for content, i'm 35, male, no children and uk based - i can confidently say that i am a completely different person to who i was in my late 20's. the aforementioned situations have caused this and of course, natural growth and understanding of myself, people, and the world around me. 

the culmination of my behaviour was on june 12th of this year when i had an accident in my car, no one was injured but i did crash into another vehicle and this was under the influence of alcohol leading to my arrest and being charged for drink driving, loosing my licence and almost loosing my career. my job is actually as an on the road salesperson for a mechanical engineering company, in the building services sector and my immediate thought when i woke up in a cell the following day was that i was going to lose my job, in turn the roof over my head and everything else and the automatic reaction for me was that i wanted to kill myself, if that happened.
luckily, for me my work have been extremely supportive and even though i am now banned from driving roe a period of time have reconfigured my role so that i can use trains and other public transportation to get to meetings and site visits. i'd really turned my life around at 30 years old and gone from comfortable jobs in procurement to switching to sales, pushing myself to do better, earn more and really challenge myself. in the blink of an eye i nearly threw all of that effort away. 

this culmination of events, the crash and the stressful situation surrounding it has really served as an eye opener for me, a blessed chance to start again, be independent again, learn to live a different kind of life, reevaluate whats really important to me and to learn to cope and deal with having bpd. i am currently taking quetiapine as prescribed however this is due to change in the next couple of weeks to an alternative medication. i've found the quetiapine has really helped as previously i was misdiagnosed (back in november 2020, when i had a breakdown at my previous employment and was very close to throwing myself infront of a train) as being chronically depressed and given sertraline. this went from 50mg up to 150mg by january of this year and i felt dead on my feet so stopped taking it. i didn't go back to the doctor and spent from end of january through to june unmedicated, instead trying to manually manage how i felt. fuck was that a bad idea...

a month on from receiving my diagnosis, attending therapy and airing all my issues, thoughts and getting things off my chest i feel great. i now commute everywhere by train and bike (bought myself a decent one and love to go out at the weekend, jump on the train to somewhere new and bike for rest trails around the uk), i've started back at the gym 5 days a week and can see and feel the difference that's making.

in the words of the classic fatboy slim album, ""you've come a long way baby"" and i really do feel i have. sure they'll be dark days ahead but i'll deal with those accordingly this time and be thankful for what i do have.

i'm aware that along the way i've worried, disappointed and pushed people away (i can hear the words i've said and see the things i've done) but i'm not going to beat myself up for that. it's done now and the only way when you hit rock bottom is up, and i'm going all the way up and using this time off the road, this chance to start again in the most positive way. 

i'm sure there is more i've missed here, but it's hot and i'm fed up of typing, ha.

thanks for reading anyway, if anyone wants to chat then feel free.

This is my heavy BPD story,"trigger warnings - death, cancer, self-harm, drugs, suicide and drugs.

    i was adopted. my father had cancer when my brother was a baby and became infertile.
    my father had cancer again when i was around 7. was pretty traumatized, but was ok with thoughts of how i’d grow up with only my mom with me and sort of accepted it as fate.
    my mom was diagnosed with cancer in my first year of secondary school (13yo). uncurable, only stabilized for 3 years, and she passed at age 51. she suffered. i was not good to her or the rest of my family since the diagnosis. my father and i haven’t gotten along at all since.
    i struggled with self-harm and suicidal thoughts around age 16, started seeing a therapist.
    family doctor gave me antidepressants, i have generalized anxiety disorder and severe major depression.

    i’m now age 18 and i finally get to request treatment in mental health.
    i’m admitted to the er and diagnosed bpd after calling 811 after a morning of feeling extremely unwell. answers a lot of questions.
    i’m sent to crises center (most hellish days of my life, all days included) for 10 days.
    i begin escorting.
    few months later, i call 911 on my father after he finds out about the escorting.
    few hours after they leave, first suicide attempt. i wake up at the hospital.

Relationship Struggles.,"i’m a younger person and have really bad trust issues. i was diagnosed by my psychiatrist to have very likely borderline p disorder symptoms or however tf they phrased it due to my being a minor. was in an rtc shortly afterwards, this was all during christmas time 2020-2021. i got into a relationship with someone about a month after being released and have been in since. at the time i was taking 300-400 mg of seroquel (quetiapine) a day, which btw is a shit ton for a non schizophrenic especially at my age.

due to the nature of these mood stabilizers i had a severe issue laughing at jokes, smiling, and in the bedroom. i got depressed (as much as you can when heavily medicated) and decided to stop taking it. withdrawals were worse than even perks because it lasted 3 weeks. this was at the beginning of summer (late may early june) and it’s now early august. 

starting about 2 or 3 weeks ago i’ve had severe paranoia when it comes to me and her and my friends. the typical, needing constant reassurance that i’m doing okay, thinking their lying to me and going behind my back, and general mistrust of anyone i interact with. at night i have very intense dreams of myself being seriously injured and mutilated or me messing up and ending up back on the streets. i feel like i can’t trust anyone i love and they’re all going to just end up leaving me.

a little bit of background. my father wasn’t involved in my childhood and left when i was 8. he came back 2 years later and was visiting every couple of months. mom was my main guardian but we be had a very strained relationship with many fights. had a couple gfs leading to this one but always ended it short due to manias or panic attacks over their motives. spent a lil time locked up and now we’re here. since i’m a guy i don’t feel safe talking to anyone and i feel trapped in my head. i want help with this but no one in my life is someone i can talk to and therapists aren’t an option. that’s why i’m reaching out to y’all:)

couple ending notes, i’m currently completely sober but have a long history of drug abuse. i’m not physically violent with anyone mentioned and the thought horrifies me. i don’t have much extended family nor are we close. i’m not suicidal in the slightest and i won’t be.

conclusion: what can i do to stop feeling this way or atleast keep this going till i do feel secure again? knowing me i’ll feel completely fine in a week though :/ sorry for the length, a lot in my head and no one to share with. also i enjoy being thorough :)

i always knew it was kind of delusional but i wanted to have kids with him. i wanted to be accepted into his family and i imagined my name with his last name and i just really convinced myself it was possible. and then those two words: move on. my heart is shattered. i went off seroquel over a month ago because it fucked with my brain enough that i failed last semester in college. my gpa is 1.3 and i've been given one semester to turn things around before they kick me out. and if i get kicked out of school, my family will be so disappointed. i will be so disappointed. i'm so tired of being disappointing to everyone. but now that i'm off seroquel my mood is all over the place. stupid small remarks from people make me suicidal. even kind things. why am i so sensitive. everything hurts. i'm still taking an antidepressant at least but i just feel unstable. i'm so sick of this stupid illness.

Intense desire to go to an assessment armed. Please can someone be the rational self I cannot be right now?,"i have no fucking clue what else to do. i need someone to tell me what i am not telling myself.

 i am 29m uk and for the past 6 months i have been desperately seeking help from my local services and all they have done is fuck me around, not listen and try and fob me off on basic counselling bollocks. cards on the table, the reason they give for this is because over the years i have self-medicated with weed (and a range of various psychedelic substances, in what i call my 'crazy drug year' about 4/5 years ago) and as such i ""can't be diagnosed with anything until you are 6 months off substances and still displaying symptoms"".

since the close of 2014 i started doing really well. i wasn't drinking at all (something i had done relatively consistently as a coping mechanism since 14), only drug i took was weed, i started working for a respectable insurance company for which i am currently on sick leave after 4 successful years and two promotions (the 2nd of which put me into a new level of stress intensity that i was struggling with but one that i was wanting to try solving by quitting the weed and using the money saved to try microdosing psilocybin as a form of natural anti-depressant) . most importantly, i wasn't fucking up the lives of those few souls doomed to enjoying my company. the only trade off was that all of my energy was being spent on maintaining the work persona well enough that the fucked up parts of me never manifested.

but, and i am sure enough of you will relate when i type this, all that does is create a shadow self out of your worst aspects. a gigantic  and ferocious wolf that will hunt that persona down and rip it's fucking throat out.

6 months ago i found out that my best friend (long time friend, in the absence of another long time friend had recently ascended into fpdom), who i had moved in with 6 months earlier on the premise that it was going to be a stable arrangement for 2/3 years, had decided that now he had been getting laid for a month and a half, he was gonna move in with his mum to save rent money towards a deposit on a house. how did i come to find this out? he fucking blanked me for all of december (unless i actively cornered him). i worked up the courage (read: went back to smoking weed because i couldn't handle the idea of trying to talk to him calmly after a month of silence) and actually faced him about it. this was just under 4 months away from the end date of the tenancy. i will never know how long he would have left it (oh sure, he argued that he didn't remember that agreement but it speaks fucking volumes that he never once spoke to me about his damn plans. something he refuses to answer for).

my finances are fucking terrible (one of 3 reasons i needed stability for 2/3 years. i was on a game plan to get up the next pay level bracket) and i knew i couldn't smoke and get moved. if i could get moved at all. getting the place we had was hard enough because i have two cats (the only family i have left and the very reason to keep breathe in my body - reason 2 for needed stability). i quit the weed, got more stressed out at work (which made my interactions with angry customers with unfixed cars ten times worse which in turn meant that i was more stressed which int- you know). my head became horribly obsessed with violent emotions and images towards my flatmate which would then explode into absolute shame and horror and evenings of working out how one actually goes about killing ones self the most efficiently. i had method, and a list of where to source the parts. all i needed was payday to give me enough money to buy it all. i was barely sleeping i was so angry (at him. at myself).

around the 10th of jan, i snapped and called my hook. he told me he had white widow, my favourite strain and one that doesn't come round very often. the loving universe was pointing the way. while there i took a huge vaporized hit (something i never do - spliff or pipes baby). it got me so uncomfortably high. my will to live personified in my head to have a serious fucking discussion with me (or rather i should say i personified in my head to have a serious fucking discussion with the bastard self that was making plans to end it all - hey, it aint the will to die that is reaching out for help on reddit).

two days later, still beasted by that experience, i broke down in a pdr at work, struggled through admitting my ideations and started on the road to get help. it took another 5 days but i went to my gp. i was fully upfront with him but he was new, my old one had retired. i'm facing homelessness in 3 and a bit months and i am not strong enough to do the necessary. i can't even be at work. here take these pills and stop smoking weed. worked about as well as one might expect.

it was my 2nd visit with the doc that kicked off the intense desire i come to you with. things were worse at home. flatmate and i weren't speaking unless i was berating him for not doing shit. for the first time in 6 years i put my fist through a wall and whilst i couldn't be around anyone, i was not dealing with being on my own without getting stoned. my usage had doubled as i was home more.  the doc upped my dosage from 50mg to 100mg and sent me back to work. the rage increased. the desire started as wanting to scream ""do you want me to open a fucking vein in  front of you"". which quickly morphed into the desire to take a knife in with me and just do it.

of the 10 days i was arranged to be at work i sorta managed 4. i went back to the doc 2 weeks on from the 2nd appt and had to bring my deceased father's best friend (the one who protected my father from...well...my father) i simply didn't trust myself. 

look above is the important shit. the next lot is basically referral to a service that then passes the buck to another service who then passes the buck to another service. there was a couple big blowouts that came close to me walking into places with a set of knives with the intention of making big fucking statements. there was about a month where my belief in universal consciousness and jung's psychic archetypes morphed into this belief that i was channelling the jesus-buddha-skywalker archetype to which my response was to roll with it but in a satirical way. that way i could experience it without taking it too seriously. this period of time reduced the amount of friends i have to the family my mad dead alcoholic dad belonged to. and we do that all the way til to-fucking-day.

i have been living in a car since the end of april. i have started drinking again (partly to help with sleep and partly because i am identifying far too much with my dad given that i am using his old support family - damn near shaved my long hair and beard just so i'd look more like him and further solidify myself in his memory) i have nearly lost my cats twice. they are currently at a foster home where the more sensitive of the two is going into hiding for days at a time. this experience has been fairly fucking traumatic for them. 

i have waited out to see the psychiatrist who spent all of our session directing me away from the things i wanted to talk about and refusing to see any validity in the stuff i was saying. she fucked me off with the promise of a councillor and the same bullshit ssri's with possibly a low dose of what i'd bet to be quetiapine.

a few hours following the appointment, i managed to get one of the assessment nurses i spoke with to call me and just utterly exploded on him. he has got me in for another appt tomorrow at 11 and i really need this to work. which is feeling like i need to finally make good on going in there with a knife or two and exploding. i mean shit, even if i don't go in armed i am going in angry enough to scream and break shit.

The road to my diagnosis,"hello everyone, first and foremost i'd like to say that if i'm not posting this to the right place, to feel free to take it down. 

now that that's out of the way, this is my first post so excuse me for any missteps. 

anyway, onto my story (i'll keep this as short and concise as possible... maybe bullet points?) 

when i was in elementary school (think grade six or seven) i encountered abuse for the first time. it scarred me to this day, and i won't go into much detail in this post (since it's its own story). i ended up having to go to court in grade ten, and my family sort of fell apart. through this entire time, i was constantly invalidated and questioned as to whether it happened. 

after i was done highschool, i ended up being kicked out even though i really wasn't that bad of a teen (at least in my eyes. i never smoked, drank, or did any drugs) and i ended up in a close to five year abusive relationship. during that time i also went to university for a while, and that's what i got diagnosed with manic depression type 2 (or bipolar type 2). 

i managed to leave that toxic, abusive relationship in part thanks to the rock in my life who was my friend at that point when a lot of my friends lived back home and were a solid hour and a half away (i don't drive). anyway, i started seeing a new family physician who referred me to the psychologist under his practice and when i met up with him, he told me i had been improperly diagnosed by the first psychiatrist. he's the one that told me i had borderline personality issues, a more -mild- version of bpd. he wanted to put me on lamictal (lamotrigine), but i refused it since i had other things to take into consideration too. 

it's been about two years since this all came to a head, and i have some really bad days, but i'm doing my best to maintain a healthy mind set and work on parts of me that can be problematic. i do things, or say things at times that i don't mean to and it really hurts me and those around me that i care most about. in due time, i'm sure i'll likely do some therapy but since my living condition will be up in the air soon, i have to play the waiting game. for now, i've been trying to tackle things with books on better understanding my condition. 

i hope you're all having a good start to the week, and i'm sorry about the wall but i figure if anyone would be able to relate, it'd be you guys. thanks for taking the time to read this. &lt;3

"My friend has BPD, has been very suicidal, and I want to help without getting too close and hurting myself. Please advise! CW: Suicide, Self-harm, Overdose, Abuse","my friend is 18 and came to my university this spring for their first semester. they have been diagnosed with bpd and are trying to get diagnosed with asd. they have a long history of being abused, and literally don’t remember most of their life due to extreme trauma and neglect. school was going ok, but then they got sick, medications were causing dizziness and fainting spells, and therefore grades started to decline, it got harder to go out and get food, etc. 

i’ve been there since the first day of classes. we met in a design class. i’m 20, have undiagnosed adhd and anxiety, and have a history dealing with suicidal friends/sos, so this can be triggering for me. 

for the past week, their suicidal tendencies have gotten extremely intense, and they’ve attempted twice, trying to od on seroquel. last night i made a deal and managed to get any potential tools for suicide out of their room in exchange for 10 mg of valium. i know it’s illegal, but we checked how it might interact with the other medications, and we were ok. they have an addiction to another benzodiazepine, so the thought of getting another one was enough to get them to give up their methods of self harm and od. 

this morning, however, they told their so about their attempts, and the conversation isn’t going well. they’re now text-screaming about how they’re just playing with numbers, life is just numbers, and proceeding to list of dates, mg of drugs, number of cuts, etc. it’s heart-breaking because obviously, i don’t want anyone to feel like that! but at this point, what can i do? i know how a bpd mind works (from an outside perspective), but i literally don’t know how to respond at this point. i feel helpless. and i also know that this is putting my mental health and grades in the line.

Psychedelics or pharmaceuticals?,"so i’m at a crossroads with how i want to heal. i have bpd, ocd, and ptsd — each of these are crippling and destructive to my life. 

on the one hand, i have psilocybin, and on the other, my seroquel prescription. i’m not sure which to choose.

personally, my intuition tells me psilocybin. i’ve heard great things about microdosing, and i want something that is going to help me change once and for all — not something i need to take everyday to stay stable. i also prefer natural healers compared to pharma. 

however, the seroquel is fast acting. i have it incase the mushrooms don’t work, which is what i’m afraid of. i’ve also heard somewhat good things about seroquel. it is a daily thing, but also it keeps me stable.

Olazapine has done wonders for my anxiety and anger outbursts,"i’ve been on seroquel nightly for two years. a temporary psychiatrist suggested swapping it with olazapine because i was still struggling with debilitating anxiety. she said it was similar so i could straight-up switch without weaning off the seroquel.

Just had to get this off my chest,"i feel as if i should put a trigger warning here but i’m not sure what for...rage? profanity?? mother issues? narcissistic parent??
there’s your warning.

why why why the fuck would you have children if you’re just going to criticize them and lie about them behind their back to family??? i did something i shouldn’t have—read my mother’s text messages—and found something that simultaneously made me feel like utter shit while also sublimely pissing me off.

a little background: my family life is...complicated, to put it mildly. i have my bpd issues as well as physical complications that keep me from working, so my daughter and i live with my parents, which benefits us all because my brother has downs, and i help out with his care. the past eight months have been hellacious on me—back in september, my psychiatrist moved 20 miles away and i don’t drive, the bus/trolley trip there was taxing to me mentally and physically, so my only option was to go through kaiser to find a new shrink. well, kaiser has one mental health location for all of the greater san diego area, and if you want to make an appointment, you’re looking at a 4 to 5 month wait. fine. whatever. so i finally get an appointment in march. i see the dr for about 40 minutes, she decides to take me off my lamictal (sure, great, it wasn’t doing a damn thing for me anyway) and gives me remeron for sleep and takes me off seroquel. follow up appointment at the end of april. awesome. great. so april 26 rolls around, and the morning of my appointment, the clinic calls and tells me the dr has cancelled. exsqueeze me??? so of course my bpd is going, “awesome, so the dr hated you so much the first time she saw you, she doesn’t want to see you again!!” which of course is not the case, but come on, trying telling that to my bpd. ok, so when can we reschedule? august. end of fucking august. four goddamn months, are you fucking kidding me??? ok anyway i am getting way off track here. long story short (too late!) i’m basically on no meds right now and i am fucked. can’t concentrate, can’t focus, i’m having mini-rages multiple times a day, followed by guilt and worthlessness, dissociating like crazy, losing track of time, seeing shit, hearing shit, i stopped taking the remeron because it’s giving me vivid nightmares, trying the seroquel again but now every time i take it i’m getting restless legs for hours at night, so fuck it. not sleeping, again. obviously, my functioning is highly impaired. i’m not keeping up with my duties around the house—cooking, cleaning, etc.—-which are largely my responsibility because my dad works full time and my mother has health issues of her own which may or may not be grossly exaggerated. (a bit of info about mother dearest—textbook narcissist, but of course she’d never admit it. in her eyes, she can do no wrong, never takes the blame, it’s always someone else’s fault.)

ok so, anyway, i’m slacking on my responsibilities not because i want to, but because most of the time i don’t feel like i’m even fucking here. i let the dishes slide for 2 days and neither my mom nor my daughter (who is 17 and more than capable of doing household chores) could be arsed to wash the fucking dishes. we ran out of spoons for chrissakes. i finally get around to doing them but by the time i get to the silverware, i’m fucking exhausted (plus my kitchen is hot as hades’ ballsack, socal june and no ac??) so i ask my daughter to finish and i sit down with a cold bottle of water. immediately my mom grabs her phone and starts texting someone and i know, i just fucking know in my gut, it’s my aunt. you see, i got nosy once before and read some of her texts, and learned that my dear mother texts my aunt and blatantly lies to her. so i had a sneaky suspicion she was doing it again. i ended up forgetting about it yesterday and decided this morning to check her phone while she was in the bathroom. (bad, bad, bad, i know, but she’s fucking lying about me!) and goddammit, i was right. i was fucking right.

i don’t understand why she does this. am i that awful a person, that she constantly needs to paint me as villain and herself as victim? was i that horrible a child that she needs to turn my relatives against me??? i won’t confront her, because she’ll play the victim as per usual, but fuck!! she has me doubting my own fucking sanity.

"Significant other shows traits of BPD (TW: R*, OD)","so, i’ve been seeing this guy for a while now. we’ve gotten very close and getting to him has been one of the most exhilarating experience of my life. it’s been a very “movie-like” experience.. the one where two people fall in love at first sight and their whole lives change. 

he’s amazing…

except for the few times that he has been an entirely different person.. he’s 21, and had a hell of a life experience. he has a slight addiction problem that’s gotten drastically better since meeting him. cocaine is his weakness, but likes anything - really. he’s pretty much dwindled it down to occasional drinking, and very rarely coke. we also smoke weed pretty regularly. he takes celexa for bipolar. his full-on episodes only occur after consuming about 5-6 shots of alcohol. literally becomes the polar opposite of the guy i’m i experience most often. very negative, frantic, hostile, and confrontational and that’s keeping it pretty vague. it’s obvious from an outside perspective that he feels highs and lows very intensely. like will get triggered by things that most people wouldn’t be bothered by.

he recently started taking 75mg of seroquel at night for sleep because of his intense nightmares. it’s helped tremendously at night, and lasts some through the morning, but the 10mg of celexa doesn’t quite prevent the extreme mood swings over little triggers (like pop music playing on the radio in the car instead of rock or metal). 

he’s told me about various traumatic experience in his past including a cheating fiancé, losing his best friend to an od last year, r***, and himself oding 6 separate times on cocaine in the past. 

anyway, i love him, and i want him to be okay more often. what is the best way that i can be there for him? what should i do when he’s having an episode? it’s difficult not to allow my emotions to get enrolled at times, but if it’s seriously out of his control, i’d like to do the right thing.

"Killing the BPD, Killing the only thing that made me alive... my story","hey /r/bpd,


i just wanted to connect with people who would understand.  i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder at age 15 or so.  my parents were divorcing and i kept trying to off myself.  i was a cutter into my mid to late twenties.  plenty of psych ward admissions.  two failed marriages and 3 estranged kids.  anyways, i am 30 now.


last year i had an updated psychological assessment done and the psychologist told me that i don't qualify for bpd anymore but that i have a form of ruminative ocd / depression.  labels aren't important, the reality of what i feel is.  


anyways, i've been on every med available over the years.  currently i am on seroquel xr and zoloft and clonazepam.


i used to be really impulsive and that ruined my marriages, cause i was always thinking the grass was greener and i admit i was a cheater.  i also tried to kill myself for years, though i think i didn't want to die.  i'm not stupid and if i wanted it permanent, i could have figured it out.  i stopped cutting, though i have the urge often, i used to cut a lot and i have the scars... which i'm kind of proud of... a badge that i went through hell.  i only stopped because my partner started freaking out on me for cutting.


so it's been years now that i've made improvements.  and by improvements, i should say i've met the goals of therapy and the er nurses don't know my name anymore.  


i just want to say that while i saw bpd as a curse and something i agreed to be treated for, in a way, killing the bpd in me, killed a big part of me and my sense of being alive.


now, i miss certain things.  mostly i miss feeling.  it's true that i felt to extremes.  i would love so fiery and intensely, and i would grieve with the same intensity.  life was a bit of chaos.  and yeah, it was getting out of control.  but the answer is not to not feel.  i am a robot now with the therapist in my head that can counter just about anything.  i have been in therapy more than half my life, and i studied it in school.  having the rational answers and the moderate outlook are helpful in not drawing attention to yourself, but honestly, i feel like a ghost, like i don't even exist.


i'm still left abandoned... by family, by friends, by the women i loved.  and so it's just me and this sense of emptiness.  you know ""chronic emptiness"".  that part of things never went away.  and solving some bpd symptoms didn't do anything to make relationships happen.  


in a way, though i viewed my past as hell while it was happening, i look back with romanticism.  i look back and i know that i felt, i know that there was something magical and energetic about life.


i just wanted to ""rant"" because i doubt i'll ever feel that way again.  i desire to feel, but the only ways i ever knew how have been taken from me.  


if you are trying to heal, i support you and can give advice as to certain things, but at the same time, i encourage you to accept yourself for who you are and not try and be something that you aren't.  sometimes, it could be said to be true that bpd is normal and everyone else is crazy -- and i think it's true, because a healed life is not a real life, it involves a lot of tricking of your own mind and intuition.  


i just encourage you toward love.  love is the key.  if you can feel, even if it goes from extremes, focus on the love.  that is when i felt alive.  and when chaos comes, you'll survive it.  you think you won't, but you do.  love yourself and love others, and don't be something or someone that you aren't.

"I shared upcoming happy news with my sister, and she made me hate myself.","backstory: hi there. new to this sub, and just diagnosed with bpd and adhd a little over three years ago. was incorrectly diagnosed with bipolar type 2 at 15 and was over medicated for 10 years until i sought a new diagnosis at 25. 

as you all probably know, irrational bouts of anger, anxiety, and extremely low self worth are just a few of the diagnostic criteria for bpd. these are the areas i still struggle with the most, but my fiancé / boyfriend of three years is the most amazing support system and his belief in me is mind blowing. i feel like finding him was the universe's way of paying me back for my mental illness and mood disorder. 

i spent years in and out of psych wards as a teen, had a suicide attempt at 17, but have refused to give in. i completed a dbt therapy course and will most likely seek basic therapy in the fall when i get insurance. my biggest struggle right now is my medication. i'm currently taking zoloft, and it just isn't enough. i will be coupling it with seroquel once i can find an affordable pharmacy. hopefully this will fill the gap. 

current day: family vacations have always been a struggle. my family is a bunch of short fuses, and my baby sister (24) and mother deal with high anxiety like myself. i get my temper from my dad, and my middle sister (26) is just mean. we have never gotten along, especially when confined to day after day of family activities. we have fought all through our childhood, and i was hoping to have a better relationship with her as an adult. (spoiler alert: not happening.)

i know my limits, know when i need a break, know when i need to separate from my family. and when you're in a foreign country (where i currently am), makes it even harder to have that space. 

i'm also half way around the globe, away from my home, my safe space, and 1% milk because apparently that isn't a thing in europe. i also smoke marijuana to help keep my anxiety down. it's readily available in oregon where i live, but definitely not in rome. 

all of this combined, with medication effectiveness that comes and goes, has had my anxiety at a 10 since i left home. 

it's been a long, stressful vacation full of not knowing where we are, not knowing the language, and 8am-8pm days of site seeing and tours. and it has been the most amazing week of my life...but i've reached my breaking point. 

last night i was out having a drink and smoke with my middle sister, her boyfriend, my fiancé, and myself. the two boys leave for a moment, and we had been talking about family and such. i wanted to share with my sister that after our wedding in september, my fiancé and i wanted to try for children. very excited to take this next step, i'm the first to be married, and my parents are so excited for grandkids. 

so i mention this to her, and what is the first thing she says? not congrats or excitement or surprise. her exact statement was, ""what happens if you're on vacation and you get angry? you don't want a baby around that.""

i don't know how i didn't murder her on the spot. my dbt skills came out of nowhere and i explained why. explained how we felt. how my fiancé and i were starting to make serious financial plans to be ready come this fall. how i'm getting my medication figured out so i don't have to pay $70/script. my parents have always financially supported me, and have allowed me to pay $50 less on our rent check to them each month to help cover my meds. (my parents bought my fiancé and i a house, and we are working with a financial advisor right now to get my fiancé and i a mortgage to take over ownership of the house.)

and she just tore me down. questioned every part of my mental health, my ability to take care of myself mentally and financially, and was just so negative. by then, the boys returned and we dropped the conversation. 

i didn't sleep at all last night and cried in the restaurant at breakfast telling my dad what happened. and he looked so incredibly sad. to see me so defeated. and to know my own sister said that to me. 

i stumbled across this sub by accident, and just needed to vent about how my sister made me feel about myself; about an illness i never wanted and never asked for. i was just hoping for some validation that i am capable of being a great mom one day, despite my issues.

"&gt;&gt;&gt;Please Read my long post&lt;&lt;&lt; It’s my birthday, I’m having suicidal thoughts and I need to get this off my chest. I need support but no one in my circle will understand.","31f my ex boyfriend of 2.5 years text me today.  i was overjoyed to receive the birthday text.  i engaged in a conversation with him, was honest about my feelings of wanting to get back together and i ended up getting rejected (again) and i feel so hurt.  i spent half of my birthday crying until i tossed back some seroquel and my emergency klonopin to calm down.

i broke up with him in october after getting into yet again another drunken fight.  i had every reason to be mad, but my abandonment issues were majorly triggered.  the next morning , while recovering, i completely overreacted, deleted him from everything, deleted my profiles from his streaming sites, and told him that i hated him and never wanted to see him again.  i even wrote him a lengthy cease and desist from contact letter and emailed it to him.  is this splitting?

in december, i was self-admitted into a psychiatric urgent care.  turns out i have all 9 borderline traits.  for the previous 9 months i had been going to therapy every week with no progress.  i started going to therapy because it felt like i physically had no control over my emotions and it started to scare me.  i felt like i was going to turn into my psychotic parents.  thankfully i’m now in a great dbt program.

all i’ve ever wanted was a family and to be loved.  my mother is an unnurturing unmotherly narcissist and my father was a brilliant man with the most extreme anger issues i’ve ever seen.  for the first half of my life, i couldn’t express emotions without being validated.  instead, my parents mocked, criticized, ridiculed me, or tuned me out.

my emotional outbursts, self-destructive behavior, and unhealthy lifestyle was too much for my relationship.  i tried my best to change, but i guess it wasn’t fast enough.  as a child, i had no boundaries and no freedom.  oh the irony.  i was completely over sheltered to the point of me being socially awkward and an outcast at school.  yet my parents were not present, were negligent and abusive.  i witnessed and experienced physical, mental and verbal abuse almost daily.  i was never taught about how to be a lady, proper grooming, etiquette, eating well, being responsible, taking care of my body, work ethic, or handling emotions.  but my mother had her hair and nails done regularly (and made me go sit and watch) and she was beautiful with a nice figure.  i, on the other hand, didn’t know that i had extremely curly hair until middle school, lol.  up until then i just thought i was cursed with poofy hair.  she just let me walk around looking like shit, dressed me in frumpy oversized clothes, and constantly criticized me for it.  i have only seen one picture where my hair looks nice.  that was kindergarten.

after my irresponsible parents got evicted when i was 12 and my mother and i went to live in a shared room at my babysitters house, my life quickly went down hill.  i rebelled hardcore by started ditching school, neglecting my school work, smoking pot and cigarettes, getting trashed on alcohol, putting myself in compromising positions, being reckless, being promiscuous.  at 16 i got pregnant by a guy who today has no driver’s license, no job, no car, lives at home, and dresses the same as back then.  so along with this no child support all these years.

some of my accomplishments:
-raising a respectful, kind, responsible child 
-established family business (7 years since i took over) with lots of growth potential, great clients and perfect office and location
-active realtor 9 years
- as business degree
-working on bachelor’s degree
- beautiful apartment 
- nice car
- lost 30 lbs in two years 

in the last few months i’ve:
-decorated my office and home.
-been completely sober for 78 days (besides pot) after wrecking my second car in a year
-i’ve cut down my one a day cigarette to once a week 
-actively been practicing my faith
- been exercising more often 
-participating in dbt (individual &amp; group therapy, phone coaching, and worksheets/handouts.

Struggling with my BPD,"i was officially diagnosed with borderline personality disorder just over 5 months ago now. but i've been experiencing the symptoms since i was 14 (i'm 19 now). i've been dating someone for the past 9 months and i know the relationship is worsening some of my symptoms (abandonment fears, brief episodes of psychopathy, feelings of emptiness). yet i cannot leave him because i love him and i'm so afraid that no one will love me or be able to tolerate me.

i'm on a waiting list to start dbt but the wait time is over a year and my medication (15mg lexapro a day, 4mg edronax a day, 25mg seroquel a night) helps reduce some of my anxiety and depression but i'm still having major episodes that end with loud arguements.

My GP won't prescribe me meds?,"i am beyond frustrated and feel helpless. i was on seroquel and trazadone for the first 3/4 months after my diagnosis. this was in the psychiatric hospital. i was weened off both as they did nothing for me other than make me tired. so i haven't been prescribed any mediation since. 

that was just over a year ago now. going through a really rough time in particular the past few weeks. crippling depression and suicidal ideation. i have wanted to try something else that could help and said so to my gp. he said he doesn't deal with ""that"". that was never the case before my diagnosis.

i was linked in with a psychiatrist from my country's public healthcare system for the second time this year, and went to my appointment last week. i made a list of my symptoms and issues i was having and went through it with her. she booked me in with a mental health team and psychologist for january of next year which is great. but of course still i haven't been prescribed anything to try ease my anxiety and depression. 

things have gotten so bad that i haven't been to work in 2 weeks now. and the longer i'm out the worse it feels trying to over come that anxiety to go back in, it's horrible and i feel useless. the sadness is too much in my chest and i don't know how much more of it i can take. 

i suffer with chronic nightmares and they are just put of control at this stage, absolutely relentless. 2 nights ago i had my first nocturnal panic attack, it was one of the most terrifying things i've ever experienced.

I need support from those who understand,"i can’t share my struggles with anyone in my life right now. i don’t have insurance so i haven’t been to therapy since i lost it. i just need to share what i’m going through with those of you who understand. 

i’m 38. most of my symptoms have gone underground. i’m pretty high functioning. it has been six years since my last hospitalization. i’ve been sober in recovery for four years, clean from drugs for six years. i’ve finished two advanced degrees and earned my teaching license. i once lost  custody of my two girls 7 and 9 in 2013 due to drugs and alcohol but i’ve had them full time again for five years. i just got married to a pretty good guy who unfortunately also has bpd. i’m doing long-term substituting. on the surface i feel like i appear perfectly neurotypical at this point. but i’m not. when i was six i suffered from a tbi from a six foot fall onto concrete that resulted in frontal lobe damage. from this, as i aged into adolescence, i got all kinds of goodies...bpd, bipolar, substance abuse issues, social and generalized anxiety, and a slew of sensory processing difficulties. i feel like i take enough lithium and seroquel every day to sedate an elephant, and this gives me emotional stability and helps me to “pass” as a neurotypical in my everyday life. 

this is of course as long as i have a stable routine and enough rest. if my boat is rocked, then i have a tendency to go to pieces. and my boat has been seriously rocked recently and i’ve had a particularly bad episode as a result. 

i started my first job teaching this fall at a school for troubled kids and a middle school boy attacked me in my classroom and i tried to go back but it was too much to overcome. i lost my income and my ability to support myself and so my fiancé and i moved up our wedding by almost a year so we could move in together (religion). this was a blessing....but it has been so damn hard. for one, i found a long-term teaching position in my former city that paid well and we needed the money. i thought my commute from his house where we were moving  to the school where i was teaching was going to be an hour, which is what the gps said...but due to traffic and added distance, it is more like an hour and a half, one way. we’ve also left my kids in school in my city temporarily as i’m continuing this job so it’s all of us up at 5:30, out by six, fighting the morning traffic in hopes to get them to school on time and me to work. coming home after bus duty and meetings we are coming in after another hour and a half drive at the mercy of rush hour traffic by 5:30 or 6 with dinner to prepare, homework to do, baths to take, clothes to wash, before we crash into bed by 8 to get up and do it all again. 

i don’t know why but this drive has pushed me into emotional oblivion. i’m overwhelmed and i’m tired and i just feel like i can’t do this, like it is too much. 

another problem is so weird...i have wanted to marry my fiancé and join our lives...but it happened so quickly, i feel like my own life has just vanished. like my city, my apartment, my recovery meetings, my local support network, all gone. his house doesn’t feel like ours yet. it just feels like this scruffy old bachelor pad i’ve crawled into. and all my belongings are still piled up to the ceiling in boxes and bags. one of my sensory processing issues deals specifically with the need for order and specificity in my environment. i need cleanliness and organization and to make my inhabited space a home where i feel comfortable and safe. i have none of that right now. i honestly feel like a homeless person who is crashing with a man. meanwhile, also, half my stuff is still at my old apartment and hasn’t even been moved. 

i’ve gotten anxiety so bad that i develop this fixation on my health. i began to perceive that i’m having a heart attack or a stroke or half my body is becoming numb or how many different kinds of cancer i must have or convinced i’m getting bell palsy. i know this sounds insane but in the moment it feels very real. this is the worst anxiety i think i’ve ever had. 

and god, the fighting between us. his hypersensitivity and mine have been ricocheting off of one another like bullets. we have concealed this from the children thankfully but he has started calling my mother and telling her “his” version of the fight and speaking against me and she and my dad believe him and both start calling me berating me and my dad starts declaring that he is going to send a moving truck to remove me back home. i had to block both their numbers today. fortunately, the rages flame up and out and we are soon back to being the idealized loves to one another. 

i am in hell right now. i’ve not wanted to drink this bad since i’ve been sober. i called into work today and fought with him on the phone and screamed and cried and i’m sorry to admit, for the first time in probably a decade, dug my fingernails into my wrist just to make the pain stop for a little while. i contemplated if i had insurance and someone to care for my children going to check myself into the hospital for a few days because i am experiencing a break right now that is scary.

The biggest problem with my life is me.,"this will probably not lead to anything but i guess venting can be helpful sometimes.about 4 years ago i got diagnosed with bpd, did (dissociative identity disorder) and ibs this was during my second year of university. i was having constant panic attacks and couldn’t even get out of bed most days. i was also smoking weed constantly to numb myself and ease the ibs pains. it didn’t really help long term but made that bad empty feeling go away for a time and it stopped me drinking 24/7.

the diagnosis helped because i got put on 25mg of quetiapine a night, this helped with sleep and the panic attacks now i get maybe 1 a week at worst. i somehow graduated with a computer science degree (barely but i did it). my mother actually admitted she was disappointed with me because i barely scraped through. my extended family also called constantly to remind me how i shouldn’t be disappointed that i failed uni. despite the fact that she knew during that time my grandpa died, i was sexually assaulted and my dad nearly died. i did not even think i would survive uni - constant suicidal thoughts daily. anyway despite everything i graduated and got a job, if no one else was going to be proud of my achievements  at least i’d be proud of myself. during the first few weeks my family constantly asked when i was going to make more money and be promoted, like just finishing uni and getting good job wasn’t enough for them. at the same time that has always been the case i was the child who got screamed at for 95% because i missed the other 5% one of the less fucked up aspects of my childhood. 

the constant physical abuse still haunts me to this day. my mother would beat my sister because she threw up from acid reflux and “embarrassed” her infront of our relatives, my other sibling and i could literally do nothing to stop this or we’d get hit and it went on for years. 

other relatives in the family were allowed to physically abuse us with impunity and when we took issue we were told “they’re only doing this because they love you”. as a child i once asked my my grandma hated us after she beat my sister for telling her to “have a good evening” because apparently she sounded “smug” my parents responded by telling my grandma i thought she hated me and they dragged me over and you guessed it another evening of physical abuse. in general my child hood was lonely, miserable and constantly filled with fear. 

by 11 i was then sent off to boarding school it was terrible constant bullying and meant school was hell, however it meant being away from my family so atleast kids don’t hit you. eventually the school realised i was pretty messed up and i was “diagnosed” with “anger issues” so they made me see a counsellor and sign a bunch of fucked up behaviour “contracts”. turns out by talking to the counsellor, they would relay what was said to teachers putting me in breach of said contract and which lead to more punishments/suspensions. eventually i just stopped talking this lead to a distrust for mental health professionals, until recently. 

i am by no means a saint and definitely contributed to some of the upset i caused myself, but i was also a bi-product of my surroundings. how can someone put love into the world when they are only taught fear and that love comes from those who you hurt you. 
now you’re caught up to speed, i’ve skipped a lot of the worst bits because each would be a post in their own right and somethings are just too nauseatingly horrible to make people read. 


in spite of everything today i’m in an incredibly fortunate position i’m in a relatively healthy relationship with my fp (we both understand codependency and communication can be an issue and are working on it improving things everyday). i recently started job that i actually enjoy (all though i’ve been off with the flu) and friends who actually care about me rather than seeing my existence as an inconvenience or interacting with me out of pity and my band got signed last month. i should be happy and living my best life but instead i still feel shit, i still want to cry all the time, i’m still intimidated and terrified of most normal people and i still smoke weed most evenings and weekends. 

i’ve reduced the quantity of weed substantially and it’s no longer the first thing i do when i wake up. it is however still my vice and to be honest it’s the only thing that really takes the pain away physically (ibs), mentally and emotionally. i want to quit so bad it’s illegal, expensive, smelly and often makes me lethargic which on top of my antipsychotics i’m not really sure how i can stay awake at all but i also don’t know if i can function without it.

the worst part is everyone i know likes me when i’m stoned, stoned me is calm, introspective and rational. sober me is hyperactive, immature and has an illogical false perspective of the world but i can’t just be high all the time. 

i’m bridging the gap to improve my relationship with my parents, first communication and slowly forgiveness. i will never forget what they put me through but i can at least forgive them for my own peace of mind. i’m also seeing a therapist although she seems to think i’m not taking things seriously because i’ve had to miss a few sessions due to illness and financial insecurity over the past two months but hopefully things come together before she drops me as a patient.

it has also been 2 years since my last medication review and my last claim for a psychiatric evaluation was rejected by my local mental health services. private care for bpd is also not covered by my health insurance and this led to a £900 bill from a psychiatrist who after 3 sessions gave me a book on cbt and didn’t even check to see if my medication is still working. i’ve submitted a new claim but i fear that too will be rejected and if that happens i’m not sure what to do because i can’t continue to let the past ruin my current life. more than anything i’m tired of wondering why despite building a good life i still want to cry and numb myself constantly.

Handling Abandonment Threats...?,"hey guys. this is my first post. i have been working on managing my bpd very closely for the past year, and i have made a lot of progress with dbt and other areas of life-managing that i also pursue. i am comorbid with bipolar disorder for which i take lithium and seroquel. i am a recovering alcoholic with two years of sobriety, and work very hard at the program of alcoholics anonymous, attending meetings and working with a sponsor and doing the steps. i am also very invested in the christian faith, which also gives me an added degree of stability. living in my skin is not exactly easy, but i work hard to be able to actually say that for the first time in my life, i am stable. i am about to finish my second master's degree in teaching, i have custody of my two young children, my own apartment. the presentation of bpd symptoms in my life is actually very rare.

but there is just one problem that i am facing, and for me, it is a big one. my partner of two and a half years has this terrible, terrible habit of threatening to leave me when we argue. he will threaten it, and then cut off contact with me for a period of time.

this never fails to absolutely throw me into what i can only describe as a living hell. i go from being a stable person who has a manageable life to feeling like i am falling apart in pieces. it is like there is this demon inside me that i have learned how to keep trapped in a cage but whenever he threatens and then acts out intent to leave me, it's like this demon gets out and jumps on me and starts clawing me to pieces. i am suddenly battling these impulses to drink, to cut myself, sometimes even to kill myself. it just explodes out of nowhere and i come unglued. i scream and yell and sob and beg him to stop. and like this most recent time, i flat out told him that if he breaks up with me then i will find someone else. 

all this feels so foolish as i am writing it. i realize that my partner didn't cause my bpd. he is not responsible for my management of it. he does not make me do or not do anything that i don't choose. but this abandonment thing is like a weird achilles heel. i am happy, functional, stable, going about living my daily life....but as soon as he threatens and acts like he is going to leave me in response to an argument, it's like suddenly none of the hard work i've done in the past year, past several years, matters. i feel like my emotions get so out of control it feels like i am fighting for my life. 

again.... i am my own singular, separate person who is responsible for herself. i understand this. but i have asked him in the past, no matter how upset he becomes at me, to please just not threaten to nuke our relationship....because this is what it does to me inside and it is just horrible. yet...if we argue to a heated enough point, he always drops this bomb. a day later he will take it back. i forgive. i try to push away the haunting remnants of how this one element of my existence is enough to make me feel like i am completely coming undone. i try to hope he will never again do this to me in a fight. 

recently, as i was saying, we argued and he began to threaten and act like he was leaving me and i fell to pieces. as i was sobbing and screaming and begging him on the phone not to, i told him that if he broke up with me, i would find someone else. this was the worst thing i said. 

it has been three days since, and i have as i tend to do just let it go and hope that he won't ever threaten abandonment again in an argument. he, however, is very wound up still about the fact that i told him i would date other people if he left me. he hasn't let that go, claims that he is devastated that i would say that. 

i finally just wrote him a letter and reminded him of what happens inside of me every time that we fight and he threatens and acts like he is abandoning me, that it is like hell on earth, and how could he still be holding on to me saying i would find someone else if he did indeed leave me? 

i'm really screwed up right now, i've let my phone die and i'm afraid to turn it on because i am sure that he is again going to get angry at me and start threatening to leave me again. i'm just so tired of my emotions telling me that i am going to lose my whole life and i am going to destroy myself if this man leaves me. as i write it, i feel really foolish and insane for even admitting that i have this experience. i just want to kill this demon that tells me to self-destruct and makes me feel like i am going to self-destruct every time my partner does this to me.",1517285249,False,BPD,2018-01-30 04:07:29,"Handling Abandonment Threats...? hey guys. this is my first post. i have been working on managing my bpd very closely for the past year, and i have made a lot of progress with dbt and other areas of life-managing that i also pursue. i am comorbid with bipolar disorder for which i take lithium and seroquel. i am a recovering alcoholic with two years of sobriety, and work very hard at the program of alcoholics anonymous, attending meetings and working with a sponsor and doing the steps. i am also very invested in the christian faith, which also gives me an added degree of stability. living in my skin is not exactly easy, but i work hard to be able to actually say that for the first time in my life, i am stable. i am about to finish my second master's degree in teaching, i have custody of my two young children, my own apartment. the presentation of bpd symptoms in my life is actually very rare.

i'm really screwed up right now, i've let my phone die and i'm afraid to turn it on because i am sure that he is again going to get angry at me and start threatening to leave me again. i'm just so tired of my emotions telling me that i am going to lose my whole life and i am going to destroy myself if this man leaves me. as i write it, i feel really foolish and insane for even admitting that i have this experience. i just want to kill this demon that tells me to self-destruct and makes me feel like i am going to self-destruct every time my partner does this to me.",handling abandonment threat hey guy first post working managing bpd closely past year made lot progress dbt area lifemanaging also pursue comorbid bipolar disorder take lithium seroquel recovering alcoholic two year sobriety work hard program alcoholic anonymous attending meeting working sponsor step also invested christian faith also give added degree stability living skin exactly easy work hard able actually say first time life stable finish second master degree teaching custody two young child apartment presentation bpd symptom life actually rare one problem facing big one partner two half year terrible terrible habit threatening leave argue threaten cut contact period time never fails absolutely throw describe living hell go stable person manageable life feeling like falling apart piece like demon inside learned keep trapped cage whenever threatens act intent leave like demon get jump start clawing piece suddenly battling impulse drink cut sometimes even kill explodes nowhere come unglued scream yell sob beg stop like recent time flat told break find someone else feel foolish writing realize partner didnt cause bpd responsible management make anything dont choose abandonment thing like weird achilles heel happy functional stable going living daily lifebut soon threatens act like going leave response argument like suddenly none hard work ive done past year past several year matter feel like emotion get control feel like fighting life singular separate person responsible understand asked past matter upset becomes please threaten nuke relationshipbecause inside horrible yetif argue heated enough point always drop bomb day later take back forgive try push away haunting remnant one element existence enough make feel like completely coming undone try hope never fight recently saying argued began threaten act like leaving fell piece sobbing screaming begging phone told broke would find someone else worst thing said three day since tend let go hope wont ever threaten abandonment argument however wound still fact told would date people left hasnt let go claim devastated would say finally wrote letter reminded happens inside every time fight threatens act like abandoning like hell earth could still holding saying would find someone else indeed leave im really screwed right ive let phone die im afraid turn sure going get angry start threatening leave im tired emotion telling going lose whole life going destroy man leaf write feel really foolish insane even admitting experience want kill demon tell selfdestruct make feel like going selfdestruct every time partner,0.5426223948774976,['Quetiapine'],"```json

well, my period is a week late and i'm not pregnant (took a test, don't have sex often and only with my fiance, with a condom). this isn't normal for me, but i admittedly am in awful shape and not taking care of myself at all.

I'm very lost,"so just recently i had a very good friend pass away, he was older around my dad's age but we were very close and actually was more of a father figure than my own ever was to me. sadly i was the last person to speak to him before he passed away in his sleep, it was ruled a heart attack... sadly that night i went over and talked to him he had taken a pain med (he had a work related injury) as he was in pain. he got a methadone pill from a coworker, as he told me this i became angry with him.... being a former addict i knew it was strong for someone that didn't take pain meds often and it isn't even really used to control pain but help with withdrawal. he was very incoherent but i had seen him like this when he had his knee operated on due to the work injury we was a lightweight with pain meds.

  well, he was fading in and out on me and ended up falling asleep on the couch so i stayed for a bit as i was using his wifi on my laptop and i finished up, turned the lights off and let him sleep. that is the last time i saw him as he was cremated, today was his funeral services.

  throughout all of this happening, the medicine i am on which is seroquel xr, i have had to up the dose to help keep myself 'sane', well i was doing it a lot, my doctor had me at such a low dose it wasn't doing anything.... i called and requested an earlier appointment with my doc due to the situation, but today realized i would be out of meds tomorrow and i don't have an appointment until the 20th where she could stock me back up on samples. i called today asking if i could get in sooner as i deemed this an emergency visit or at least come in to get more samples, no go.... i have to see the doc, and the soonest that would be is on the 20th... so i'm looking to be going 14 days w/o medicine..i got angry but not with the secretary on the phone and simply said please cancel all future appointments as i will just be going to the hospital even though i don't want to i feel it is my only option to ensure i stay 'level'... just for a fyi, she had me on 25mg seroquel xr once a day (that meant breaking a 50mg xr tablet in half) and i was taking 200mg to stay sane, i don't get why she put me on such a low dose as she had me on this med before but it was at 150mg.

  i have had some rough spots where i lost control and could do nothing but cry for my friend, he was my only friend.. he accepted everything about me including my mental issues and i have been blaming myself for not doing something that night, knowing that what he took was way too powerful and with him having heart conditions already that it was way too risky, being a former pain killer addict i knew all of the signs to watch out for and it seemed like i ignored them and most of all i hate myself because i left his house angry with him.

  i know none of this is my fault, and there was nothing i could really have done...but he just meant so much to me and the loss hurts like hell and now i'm dealing with my doctor not cooperating with me during this very rough time, i don't want to go off of meds as i feel that they are working (at least at the doses i have been taking) and i'm scared i'm going to loose control after i take my remaining medication tomorrow.... i'm scared, i'm sad, i'm angry.... and i do not know what to do.

Getting off seroquel,"i've been on meds for about 10-11 years and about 4-5 of those i've been on 100mgs of seroquel.

anyways with all of these good things after lots of thought  i have decided that i have gotten the benefits of being on medication and i'm ready to get off them. my dr lowered my 100mg dose  to 50mg last thursday. on sunday i was sick with a cold and had a fever so i did the reg stuff one is supposed to get better. today i noticed that while i'm no longer coughing, my body still feels sickly. i'm hardly eating and i just feel a bit out of it and a lil nauseous. i also am getting slight chills 

could these be symptoms or withdrawal? i see my dr on the 25th so she can lower my dose to 25mg (after a month of being on 50mg) 

are there things i can do to help the withdrawal symptoms? i just started my new job and i do not want to fuck that up. today i left early because i was not feeling well but i'm in the clear because my boss remembered how much i was coughing the other day. i am still working my retail job part time along with my new 9-5 till i move into my new apartment in late feb so i need to keep it together for this tiring schedule. once i'm off this i'll only be on a low dose of aderall but that's it and i'm really excited but scared.",1515209657,False,BPD,2018-01-06 03:34:17,"Getting off seroquel i've been on meds for about 10-11 years and about 4-5 of those i've been on 100mgs of seroquel.

weird effects from quetiapine,"i got prescribed quetiapine a month ago and ive been taking 50mg up until yesterday when i was told to start taking 100mg instead. never had any side effects until then. i took my dose and 30 minutes later i cant stand up without my heart racing and feeling extremely dizzy and tired. my heart didnt race as long as i was sat down but i was genuinely scared of having a heart attack last night and i convinced myself i was just going to die in my sleep. woke up 15 hours later and felt totally fine.

is this normal? am i just supposed to wait for my body to adjust to the new dose?",1606088200,False,BPD,2020-11-22 23:36:40,"weird effects from quetiapine i got prescribed quetiapine a month ago and ive been taking 50mg up until yesterday when i was told to start taking 100mg instead. never had any side effects until then. i took my dose and 30 minutes later i cant stand up without my heart racing and feeling extremely dizzy and tired. my heart didnt race as long as i was sat down but i was genuinely scared of having a heart attack last night and i convinced myself i was just going to die in my sleep. woke up 15 hours later and felt totally fine.
