The Way Social Media Assumes Things About and Is Portraying BPD is So Fucking Harmful and Frustrating,"like i’m a rare case of bpd developing at a very young age, i’ve dealt with it fo at least 14 years most of which were unknowing on top of a laundry list of other co-morbid problems and disorders.  the current social media narratives around this disorder is so fucking scary for me to see.  

i see teenagers on twitter and tik tok self diagnosing and talking about their “fps” with heart emotes and asking for advice on how to tell them.  like it’s just an intense fucking crush and not a horrible obsessive fixation no healthy person with good intentions towards you would be comfortable with/want you to have towards them for both you sakes.  one that it is your responsibility to manage and not put on another person who didn’t ask for it.  

it’s either romanticized enabling bullshit that mirrors my internal dialogue i used to justify some of my worst behavior moments that ruined relationships or are still affecting my life today.  and treats mood swings as a quirk instead of an incredibly invasive and overwhelming experience that feels like it retraumatizes you a little every time.

or it’s infantilizing and demonization.  “they can’t control themselves, they’re naturally manipulative, they have no idea they’re doing it and can never change.”  i am extremely aware of myself and my issues constantly.  to the point i have to also worry about accidentally gaslighting myself as a coping mechanism on top of regulating my fucked up emotions.  i work so hard to be self aware, manage my mood swings in a way that doesn’t lash out at others, limit pushing other people’s boundaries, and argue with myself and play devils advocate whenever i’m splitting on someone.  

this condition has permanently altered how i function as a person and made my life so much harder than it needed to be.  and despite mental health being such a “hot topic” for people to throw attention to and improve the narrative on?  i’ve never felt more misunderstood by the world than the last few years.  and it’s so fucking frustrating.",1643064326,False,BPD,2022-01-24 22:45:26,1,0,0,"The Way Social Media Assumes Things About and Is Portraying BPD is So Fucking Harmful and Frustrating like i’m a rare case of bpd developing at a very young age, i’ve dealt with it fo at least 14 years most of which were unknowing on top of a laundry list of other co-morbid problems and disorders.  the current social media narratives around this disorder is so fucking scary for me to see.

(LONG) Looking for any kind of help regarding a friendship/relationship with someone having bpd.,"hello everyone; this is going to be rather long so thanks to everyone actually reading over all of this, i really appreciate it, english is not my first language and i am very confused about a lot of stuff that's going on so i am really sorry if there are any passages that might be confusing or hard to read/understand, i'm trying my best.

i met this girl (online)  somewhere around june last summer; she was in a relationship when we actually met, with no intentions of anything more than friendship between us. her (extremely toxic) relationship was basically over already at this point (which i did not know at this point of course) and the break-up was basically a few days after we first had contact. 

she had her best friend/favorite person which was basically there for her all the time, but apparently she found me very interesting as well, so we had quite a lot of contact during this time as well. i'm a generally very empathic person and am always happy to help or be there for someone if i'm actually able to help them feel better, so naturally i did. she grew attached quite fast and we basically had contact every day without exception, (via chat at first, calls/talking via discord later on) due to her mental state at this point, she opened up very quickly to me(about her having bpd as well), talking about basically everything and i had absolutely no problem with this. i was actually happy for all the trust she put into me. 

all of this was very interesting to me, and mental illness is something that is very interesting to me anyways (i had depression for quite a while, as well as some other mental health issues; still in therapy as well, but i'm at a point where i'm actually stable without any limitiations to every day life or anything similar) and she actually suggested me a book about bpd since i mentioned that i was openly interested in understand her and the illness. we grew attached quite a lot over time - still: as friends only, but we would have some cheeky flirting going on all the time, nothing serious though. over time, this had become more and more though, with her even telling me that ""she would probably have fallen in love with me, if she wasn't right in the middle of lovesickness"" which was obviously very flattering for me, but nothing more than that. at some point we even went over chat logs with her ex, for her to realize that she wasn't the (only) problem in her relationship and only at this point she actually noticed how terribly toxic her relationship and ex-bf actually was (i was sincerely shocked over how cruel people could actually be.). obviously she wasn't completely innocent how her relationship went but this was nothing one-sided at all. 

due to this she could finally conclude the relationship and any ""chance"" to ever actually get together with him ever again.  this is where it probably started getting complicated as i slowly started developing feelings that involved more than friendship and it was quite obvious that she did as well. this all happened around 4 months after we got to know each other and at some point she actually opened up about how she was feeling as well and that she actually fell in love with me. due to her only coming out of a 2 year relationship and the distance between us (around 7 hours) we didn't go that much further into this and just went on with how it went between us anyways, doing stuff together online, the usual flirting, watching movies together, etc.

fast forward, in november we started planning to actually meet up and we did actually meet in december. this was a huge thing obviously (her therapist; she started therapy in late october that year; actually scrutinised this heavily and i was actually unsure if she'd actually pull through, with all of this, but she did and we met up)

 the time was amazing, with her getting to know my family, me getting to know hers, we had tons of fun and an amazing time together. there were so many signs of how great we actually fit together; all the stuff like her mentioning that i actually made her feel good and beautiful for the first time in her life (she did have some terrible relationships, she was actually completely confused when i started adressing compliments to her, as she never experienced something like that in her life.). we actually were together for a few days, when she realized that this was all too fast for her and she was not ready for a relationship at this point, which obviously made me very sad but there was nothing i could do at this point that would actually change anything so i could only accept this for now. we simply carried on as before as... ""very good friends""? i guess. 

there has been a lot back and forth since then with her saying that she definitely wants to see me again, that what we have actually is a relationship, just without calling it like that because she's afraid of it. her saying that she has no time/power/strength for a relationship but on the other hand. her telling me that i should stop having any expectations or hope as she is unable to actually ""love"" or ever have a ""healthy relationship"". her having her priorities everywhere but about having a relationship at all. at one point she actually mentioned that she wants to see me again, but that i shouldn't have any kind of hopes about ""getting together"" at this point, that she just wanted to see me again, that she just wants to have someone be with her.

i honestly sometimes have no idea at all what of this her bpd is and what's actually rational thinking of her. this permanent uncertainty is really nagging on me and is sometimes making me feel really terrible (especially her mentioning the fact that she cannot have a relationship at the moment, feels really bad.).  

there are so many contradictory signs where at one point she tells me about how we do actually have a relationship, i just shouldn't see or call it as one, as this is what she's struggling with; her telling me how she's completely trusting me and how important i am for her but on the other hand the fact that i should not have any hopes or expectations as she's way too scared of not being able to ""fullfill""? them and losing me altogether. 

once again, i am really sorry about how complicated all of this might sound (it is extremely complicated in my head, so it is actually really hard to write this all out.) and i'm really hoping that everything is understandable to a certain degree. at no point ever have i ever thought about ""ending"" this or to stop working on all of this as she really is everything i've ever wanted in a partner, i truly am in love, as complicated as it might be, i honestly do not care and am happy to push through all of this, hoping for a positive outcome. it permanently feels like she does not know at all what she actually wants or needs herself even though how obviously i am ""enhancing"" her life and making everything better and easier for her (this is not supposed to sound arrogant or pretentious in any way: this is actually something she has told me very often). she has terrible (mental-)scars from her former relationship with some of them that haven't even started healing yet at all (though, i really hope, that therapy is going to help with this) and i would be more than happy to show her, that there are is another kind of relationship than the ones she had until now.

 i am sometimes struggling though. all this back and forth is - sometimes! - very exhausting (there's times where this is worse, times where everything is a lot clearer and easier as well though). times where it's absolutely clear that she definitely wants a relationship and all of this, and other times where it feels like there is no chance for us to ever get together at all. this uncertainty is extremely hard to bear for me from time to time.

i am unsure what kind of help or support i'm looking for here, but at this point probably anything and everything is going to help. just writing all of this down (as confusing as it might be, i am really sorry) was already helpful for me. anything that i could read, learn or do, any kind of opinion about all of this, honestly everything is probably going to help me so i am happy about whatever there is to say.

Having BPD is just super tiring and I’m struggling to cope,"my life is a mess at the moment. every little thing turns into an argument with my partner and i can’t stop myself, we’ve been arguing for two days and i just don’t have the energy to anymore. i don’t mean to turn every mountain into a molehill, but i just can’t help it - i can’t control myself.

I think I’ve found a new FP and I’m exhausted and paranoid.,"i met a guy online a few weeks ago. he seemed nice and into me. i haven’t really dated, like ever, not seriously. i had one teenage romance and it made me a crazy person. after almost a decade, the longing for romance kind of diminished. until i met b.

Going to be evaluated for BPD,"hi, 

i’m hesitant to post this purely because i know there’s mixed opinions on minors receiving bpd diagnoses (i’m 16f) but i want to do it anyway.

i went through severe trauma in my childhood and suffered a lot since. the last time i saw a psychiatrist was at 14 and he said i did have very clear traits of bpd but that he wanted to see if it would go away as i got older. i got a bunch of diagnoses including unspecified bipolar disorder but it didn’t fit. i received cbt and emdr and to treat my trauma and other diagnoses and a few different meds but it wasn’t effective at all. 

it’s recently got to the point where my behavior has spiraled out of control and neither my mother, current psychologist or school or really anyone in my life knows how to handle me anymore. so tonight i have an appointment with my psychologist and she told me they’ve been in touch with a place that specializes in personality disorders and can help treat my symptoms and possibly diagnose me if they are certain i have it. 

to get into all my symptoms would make for a very long post but if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask. i’m just very anxious because i don’t know what to expect and i wasn’t even aware of how much problems i was causing with my behavior.",1643033749,False,BPD,2022-01-24 14:15:49,1,1,0,"Going to be evaluated for BPD hi,

My best friends I was very dependent on left me and I have no idea what to do,"i’m a girl who just turned 16 a couple days ago. i had 2 friends i knew and messaged everyday for almost a year, we had a gc together and we would just infodump everything about our lives to each other. i vented there a lot about my mental health issues, mainly my bpd. i also feel like i created a fake character just to be liked by them. i was so dependent on them and their love and praise. i had no other place to vent and they seemed to be understanding of my issues so i thought it was all fine. i think a big part of the reason they started to dislike me was that despite being so mentally ill and unhappy i’ve had a rather privileged upbringing compared to them and supporting parents. i’m not even sure how most of my mental health issues developed, i believe it was genetics or because the schools i went to as a very little kid had terrible teachers who damaged me mentally. i already felt like this made my problems invalid but of course i couldn’t change my brain or how i felt. 

it was my birthday a couple days ago and they both wished me a happy birthday, i felt a little ignored by them though. we continued on as normal until i posted a screenshot of me achieving something in a game we all played and friend #1 suddenly blocked me and left the gc. i asked friend #2 why friend #1 blocked me, they said they had no idea and they probably just wanted a break. i then said i was scared i did something wrong and friend #2 said they didn’t think so, so i didn’t worry and just moved on with my day. i was worrying they would both leave me, but i denied it bc they both knew about my extreme abandonment issues and that they were some of my only friends so why would they do that to me? then i saw friend #2 unfollowed me on all social media, that’s when i panicked. i decided i would leave them before they left me to avoid the feeling of abandonment so i unfriended them on other platforms before they could. then i got a very long message from friend #2, they explained that we can’t be friends anymore. they were aware of my issues and said that i need to seek professional help, and that they can’t help me and they’re afraid they’re enabling me and making it worse. they also told me i need to grow up bc i’m 16 now and can’t be a kid forever, they think i haven’t changed the whole year they’ve known me and act like a dumb attention seeking child. they brought up some behavior and things i’ve said that were rather stupid and damaging but i didn’t realize they were. then they said they still care about me and they want me to find better friends and be happier. i cried reading the message, i wasn’t even angry at them i was just sad. i wrote a reply apologizing and wishing them well too, but it didn’t go through because i assume they blocked me. then i got a message from friend #1, they called me spoiled and ungrateful and said some other nasty things about me.

it was my birthday a couple days ago and they both wished me a happy birthday, i felt a little ignored by them though. we continued on as normal until i posted a screenshot of me achieving something in a game we all played and friend #1 suddenly blocked me and left the gc. i asked friend #2 why friend #1 blocked me, they said they had no idea and they probably just wanted a break. i then said i was scared i did something wrong and friend #2 said they didn’t think so, so i didn’t worry and just moved on with my day. i was worrying they would both leave me, but i denied it bc they both knew about my extreme abandonment issues and that they were some of my only friends so why would they do that to me? then i saw friend #2 unfollowed me on all social media, that’s when i panicked. i decided i would leave them before they left me to avoid the feeling of abandonment so i unfriended them on other platforms before they could. then i got a very long message from friend #2, they explained that we can’t be friends anymore. they were aware of my issues and said that i need to seek professional help, and that they can’t help me and they’re afraid they’re enabling me and making it worse. they also told me i need to grow up bc i’m 16 now and can’t be a kid forever, they think i haven’t changed the whole year they’ve known me and act like a dumb attention seeking child. they brought up some behavior and things i’ve said that were rather stupid and damaging but i didn’t realize they were. then they said they still care about me and they want me to find better friends and be happier. i cried reading the message, i wasn’t even angry at them i was just sad. i wrote a reply apologizing and wishing them well too, but it didn’t go through because i assume they blocked me. then i got a message from friend #1, they called me spoiled and ungrateful and said some other nasty things about me.

"An argument has spiraled me into a borderline episode [long, sorry]","so, last night, my husband and i went on a date without the kids. during said date, i was beginning to spiral down for some reason (i had just gotten off work and i was hungry). so he knew i didn't have the best time. on the way home, we got into an argument that turned into yelling at each other.

during this argument, i had begun to have *feelings*; ones that i hadn't had in a looooong time. but i pushed them back. okay, i'm being irrational. we end up at home and go opposite ways.

this morning comes and he comes to talk to me. it begins another argument. all day i have been feeling worthless and depressed. i've stopped my medications, and i don't feel like this is a reason to start them back up yet. i know i'll be okay again soon. but even at work tonight, i just flashed back to the arguments, and i just had a really down night.

"Dating someone with BPD, when you have BPD yourself?","hi all, i’m 26m, i recently met a girl who has bpd too, we met on discord and things have been online, she lives in another country but not that far away, like an hour flight.

we’ve only known each other for about 2 weeks, but it’s been really nice so far, we play games, call and text throughout the day, we have both grown feelings for each other but i am very scared and worried it will end up going wrong.

i’m scared that our attachment issues, different interests and some personality differences will become a big problem for us and long term won’t work out and we end up very hurt as we all experience with bpd.

i’d like some advice / insight on 2 people with bpd dating by also consider the fact we’re online so far.. i told her today about my feelings and worries and we’re both left hurt and upset after the conversation, do we keep going and see how it things go? it might be amazing or do we halt things now before we get too deep?

"Desperate: Partner with BPD in Residential treatment, 3 Kids, wants a divorce. Lost and confused","&amp;#x200b;

i left my career over a  year  ago to be a stay at home dad, we were basically working just to  have  kids in daycare. i love my kids with everything i have. with out  going  into detail lets just assume we have gone through the full gambit  of the  bpd life all compact in the last year, there were signs prior  but  really triggered full the last 6 months.

she   did finally agree to go into treatment and they do specialize in   personality disorders, trauma, depression, and anxiety. their program is   geared to help, but it is only a month to a month and a half. i love   her from my depths, unconditionally. i have overlooked  some of the  negatives because of ""love"".

i  am  learning so much through this and other groups, i need to set hard   strict boundaries, and take care of myself too. i don't know if we will   even get that far. i want to wait till shes done with the program first   to talk about separating, then only discuss it after with a family   therapist, and at a 3 month point really discuss if this is what we   want. give it time, don't make a rash or emotional choice. i'm sure you   all understand how my partner would take this.

my  partner has pushed literally everyone in their life away and is pushing  me away now. they  want to ""co-parent"" after divorce, but we have never  co-parented. its  all been on me majority of the time. if we do divorce  it would not go  like they think, both sides of the family will speak  on my behalf, i am  the caretaker, i tend to all family matters. they  are in a facility,  have taken a few leaves from work do to mental  health. i really don't  want my partner to ruin the life they have, and  have worked really hard for,  but it feels like they are set on it with  out realizing it. mental  health issues suck.

i  am  willing to work hard, but more i read here and other places i know i   need to start thinking hard about the kids and myself. its why i like   the idea of waiting to see where they are at the end of the program,   then set mile stones after.

A positive post about losing an FP,"hi everyone, just wanted to come on here and write something about how i’m feeling, i hope it might resonate with some of you. today my most recent fp, a fwb situationship thing i had going on, ended things. he wasn’t mean about it and it was fairly amicable, but still hurt. i hadn’t admitted my true feelings for him and stuck around because i felt like i would rather have it than be lonely.

usually i would have had a complete meltdown. i did cry after it happened of course, that’s normal. i called my mum to talk to her about it as i couldn’t stop ruminating, afterwards i felt so much better in myself. i’ve reflected on the fact that as much as i feel i’m getting better within relationships with communication etc, i’m still not focusing on me out of relationships.

i still rely on them to make me happy as i have a lot of struggles making friends. i’m 21 and moved to a small town, about an hour away from my family, for work. i love it here but there’s not a huge social environment which makes it hard to make friends. i do get lonely and started to rely heavily on my fp for time away from home, for something to do. i knew from the start he was probably fairly emotionally unavailable due to a recent breakup but told myself i was too, so it didn’t matter.

i soon realised i had feelings and that maybe this style of relationship isn’t right for me but that’s okay. it’s okay to want someone for the long term who will want me back. i don’t want to keep begging people just to see me. i’m still learning to not constantly give myself away to people just to have them around for a little, as it feels like second nature to me. i also want to try and do things for me. so many times i’ve started to realise i put things on hold for people. for example, i was hoping to get a cat at the beginning of this month however i put it on hold because i was travelling to see my fp so often. it starts to feel like i can only leave the house for them, it’s just not healthy. 

i know many of you probably feel the same and i just felt like airing it here. we are worthy of the same healthy relationships ad everyone else. we deserve love and to put ourselves first in life. i’m proud of myself for being able to think this after what would have been devastating to me before my diagnosis, it just shows me how far i’ve come. big love to the bpd fam, we got this!",1642972558,False,BPD,2022-01-23 21:15:58,1,0,0,"A positive post about losing an FP hi everyone, just wanted to come on here and write something about how i’m feeling, i hope it might resonate with some of you. today my most recent fp, a fwb situationship thing i had going on, ended things. he wasn’t mean about it and it was fairly amicable, but still hurt. i hadn’t admitted my true feelings for him and stuck around because i felt like i would rather have it than be lonely.

A BPD Poem,"i run hot or i run cold.

overflowing as i go from one extreme to the other.  
pushing people away or holding on too tight.  
i turn my emotions inward because i’m afraid to hurt you.

i am hyper-aware of everything  
if someone takes too long to text me back, i did something wrong  
when i hear my name, i assume it’s something bad  
when i tell you all my feelings and you don’t have anything to say, you must look down on me

but borderline is not all bad  
i am passionate  
i am loving  
i throw my all into what i am doing

for me, there is no in-between  
sometimes it works in my advantage  
and other times it ends up hurting me,  
but if i care about you, i do it with all my heart.

Ghosted by my coworker FP,"i’ve had a sort of on and off fling with a coworker, and he turned into my fp. we stopped talking for a while, then i impulsively asked for his advice on something and he was super sweet and helpful. one day i jokingly told him my friends told me i should hook up with someone, and he jumped at the opportunity to say we should. i was hesitant because i wanted to be his friend and didn’t want that to get ruined but he said he’d never just ghost me and that it would be chill so eventually i agreed. i told him i just wanted to be friends (i didn’t think he was good for me romantically) and since then that’s what we’ve been. whenever we’d talk he’d say he was always here for me and that he cared about me, so i thought it would be okay to ask him to hang out. but he saw my message and didn’t reply so i took that as i bothered him and tried to leave him alone. he never responded but at work he’d go out of his way to talk to me or say hi so then i thought maybe i misinterpreted things and asked if we were okay and he said yeah but if i wanted to we could text about it later. so i did, and i said i just wanted to check in with him, and he saw that message and didn’t reply too. so now once again i feel like i am just being weird and bothering him and i’m kind of panicking.

i need opinions, because i feel like i’ve been in a nightmare since i met my now ex.

he pursued me heavily (i was just ending a relationship with someone else), asking me all kinds of questions about myself, my interests, my past exes. two weeks into talking he wanted to be boyfriend / girlfriend. i told him we were still getting to know each other, but that i liked him a lot. he took this as rejection and brought it up repeatedly in later arguments about how i don’t like him as much as he likes me and he’s not good enough for me. he would bring this up a lot especially if i was upset with something he did or i expressed myself in anyway about how i was feeling. that he was a failure and would jump to conclusions about ending things and him abruptly leaving my life. he also would talk about sex incessantly with me, but he seemed almost terrified to actually have sex with me in the beginning. his words not met by actions.

he was never wrong about things. anytime we argued (usually provoked by an insecurity of his), i would end up apologizing just to get him to calm down. he would go silent on me, gaslight me to punish me. he never ever apologized or took accountability ever for his actions.

he then met another girl, who he at first said was his friend. he started mirroring her (suddenly was interested in things she was to copy her like he did with me) and triangulating me, comparing me to her all the time. when i would say how i feel, he would blame shift and say things like i was being ridiculous, but stilll continued hanging out with her. when i broke up with him and deleted him everywhere, he lost it and started posting everywhere bragging about her to make me jealous (within the same day )

he is with her now, but trying to get me to talk to him. he said i am his favorite and he cares deeply for me.",1642967729,False,BPD,2022-01-23 19:55:29,1,0,0,"Help with ex with BPD cw: sex

CBT has never benefited me and medication only muddles my symptoms.,"i’ve been in and out of therapy since i was ten or eleven. i have a therapist now who i’ve known for almost 12 years and i like him a lot. but cbt does not work for me and never has. i don’t want to stop seeing him, though. i did look into dbt therapists in my county and none of them so far take my insurance. i don’t even know if my insurance would pay for the sessions because many don’t when you have a personality disorder.

i also have a psychiatrist (i’ve had quite a few). i’ve lost count of how many medications i’ve been on. i had my monthly session with him yesterday and he was visibly frustrated. not at me, but because no medication i’ve tried or am currently on is working like it should. he really wants me to continue therapy because he told me, “i don’t know how else to help you”. i know that he means medication can only do so much and therapy is what will help the best. but it still hurt. he also told me that bpd is extremely hard to treat (which i already know). it really me a lot and now i feel more hopeless and helpless than i ever have, i think.

Is this normal?,"hey guys, this is my first post. 
i have been seeing guy who is depressed, and was obsessed with me from the start. i thought that our relationship would be the best, because he was always giving me attention, telling me he misses me, we saw each other as much as possible (we are living quite far away so it was 2 times a week). from all this i thought that i would give him a chance. now two months later he stopped giving effort. he doesn’t see the purpose of texting all day, he never says he misses me and we haven’t seen each other in 2 weeks. i am of course crying all the time because i am sure he is leaving me and he doesn’t want me anymore. 
so i told him how i feel about this and it annoys him, he is saying that he just doesn’t wanna text all day, and he mentioned that he once said that we would see each other next week. so today (two days later) i asked him when we would see each other and he said that he maybe comes on wednesday, but he is not sure. btw, we are seeing each other in city halfway from both of us. and i told him (again) that it makes me sad that he is not giving an effort. and he is annoyed with me again because of my sadness when he is not giving me 100%. 
i should also mention that when we are together he is really loving, but now is exam season so we are really “far” away (3h is not far for me to se a loved one).

How can I help my gf to not feel bad every time I had an emotion?,"so when my gf and i got together, she was very understanding and open to learning about bpd and understanding my feelings and where they come from etc. but i think it kinda went too far? 

basically, my gf has been struggling for like the last six months because every time i have an emotion, my gf feels it too. if i'm sad, she's sad, if i cheer up, she cheers up, then gets confused about the quick change, then is exhausted from how fast my emotions can change from one extreme to the other. she knows my emotions aren't always rational, and she's educated so it feels like absolutely nothing i say to her is helpful because she knows it already? 

i'm trying to hide my emotions from her now so that she stops struggling with the intensity, but that upsets her too? and it doesn't even work most of the time, she can tell when my emotions change literally from the way my eyebrow moves even if i try to not show anything. 

and i said she should maybe try reading more about being with someone with bpd, and dealing with the rapid emotion changes etc, and she said she doesn't want to, so that's confused me too because i don't understand why she doesn't want to fix this issue. but she's also at the point where she's not happy in the relationship because of this. so i really don't know what to do?

psychic connection with my ex partner who has bpd,"for those of you who believe in this stuff, i'm pretty sure i have a psychic connection with my exgf who has bpd traits.  it's been two years since we broke up and i went no contact because she hurt me pretty bad and was devaluing me because she was unstable at that time.  i let her go and it was the hardest thing i have ever done.  i haven't dated anyone in 2 years (the pandemic helped with that/ but i just wasn't interested).  to be honest, i always hoped she would heal and somehow our paths would cross again.  from time to time i would see her birthdate pop up as the time on my phone.  no big deal right.  but then one time last year i woke up in the middle of the night and had this intuition to get on a certain dating site and i didn't know why.   as i scrolled through the pics, there she was.  i didn't send her a message- i was in shock.  then about 6 months ago something that she had given me fell and broke.  i felt that something had happened.  i meditated on it and the word ""engaged"" popped into my head.  i wasn't sure if it was real, i had no way of verifying it because she cancelled her fb account after we broke up.    which btw i felt was weird because she had done things to hurt me so why was she trying to hide?

You are a hero.,"“we survived some tough sh*t”

the universe is like a simulation, a tale, so let’s compare our trials like a video-game or a book.
you are a character that technically faced some of the hard bosses before the main quests, without upgrades, without experience. 

you won, you were just a child and you won. even though it feels as if you lost a few battles and gained a few scars. we look at the npcs and see their attire as “flawless or unbroken”

you forgot you gain experience points, valuable life lessons, we depend on of defensive gear to face small threats, because the game is now wired to expect more bosses. learn to not react, but observe.

darling, you are the wisdom of an over powered player that’s misunderstood. you’re inner child feels like frodo but you are gandalf the white. 

don’t let these small threats defeat you, you already won. be patient, accept the hardship, the injuries that make you feel defeated. that was a wicked journey in the past and you’re the most bad*ss hero. 

you faced this universe early with nothing to give, in return it gave you so much more.

the ability to feel empathy to the roots of a soul, to detect when something doesn’t feel right. you know the patterns most people ignore, and we punish ourselves because society doesn’t understand us yet? it’s a shame on them. how could hobbits understand the trails dodo faced? don’t surround yourself with people to refuse to honor your survival. 

you are destined for an adventure.
seek it.

I think I might have BPD and I Screwed Up Tonight,"hi everyone,

i’m really desperate for someone to talk to but none of my friends will understand so i’ll just vent here if you don’t mind.

i spent the last 4 years of my relationship believing that my partner had bpd and blaming that for all the difficulties we faced and the way he acted. he might still have it, i’m not sure. what i failed to realize until recently is that i might have more of an issue than i thought.

i’ve always had extreme anxiety and obsessive thinking. i’ve always had mood swings and am easily irritated or angered. i’ve always struggled with self-harm. i’ve always done absolutely anything to avoid being abandoned or would act in very shameful ways when i felt threatened.

anyway, tonight i think i messed up. my ex and i broke up about 7 months ago but remain friends. we usually talk almost every day but haven’t spoken as much this week. my car died in a parking lot today while i was running errands. i called him for help and was already really stressed and upset about the car. i jumped down his throat asking why he hadn’t been speaking to me lately and then started panicking about the car. i was so angry he didn’t immediately jump in his car to come rescue me.

after getting a tow truck sorted, he texted to check in and i told him i was on my way home and would call in a bit.

about an hour later, i tried to call. he answered but he was on a date. i absolutely lost it and hung up on him. then i texted a paragraph about how he obviously didn’t care about me any more and that this was the end of our friendship. i knew i was acting dramatically but i was so angry and so hurt that it felt like i was out of control of my body. i sh’ed for the first time in months and it was bad. i couldn’t stop crying.

it’s been a few hours and i’ve calmed down a little bit. now i’m just filled with shame and regret. i’m terrified i’ve finally messed things up for good. he can see the real me now and i feel like every outburst drives him further away. it’s no wonder he doesn’t want to speak to me- everything is a fight or dramatic.

i know i need help but i can’t get it and i’m just drowning in all this feelings i can’t control. thanks for reading",1642922178,False,BPD,2022-01-23 07:16:18,1,0,0,"I think I might have BPD and I Screwed Up Tonight hi everyone,

about an hour later, i tried to call. he answered but he was on a date. i absolutely lost it and hung up on him. then i texted a paragraph about how he obviously didn’t care about me any more and that this was the end of our friendship. i knew i was acting dramatically but i was so angry and so hurt that it felt like i was out of control of my body. i sh’ed for the first time in months and it was bad. i couldn’t stop crying.

it’s been a few hours and i’ve calmed down a little bit. now i’m just filled with shame and regret. i’m terrified i’ve finally messed things up for good. he can see the real me now and i feel like every outburst drives him further away. it’s no wonder he doesn’t want to speak to me- everything is a fight or dramatic.

i know i need help but i can’t get it and i’m just drowning in all this feelings i can’t control. thanks for reading","think might bpd screwed tonight hi everyone, i’m really desperate someone talk none friend understand i’ll vent don’t mind. spent last 4 year relationship believing partner bpd blaming difficulty faced way acted. might still it, i’m sure. failed realize recently might issue thought. i’ve always extreme anxiety obsessive thinking. i’ve always mood swing easily irritated angered. i’ve always struggled self-harm. i’ve always done absolutely anything avoid abandoned would act shameful way felt threatened. anyway, tonight think messed up. ex broke 7 month ago remain friends. usually talk almost every day haven’t spoken much week. car died parking lot today running errands. called help already really stressed upset car. jumped throat asking hadn’t speaking lately started panicking car. angry didn’t immediately jump car come rescue me. getting tow truck sorted, texted check told way home would call bit. hour later, tried call. answered date. absolutely lost hung him. texted paragraph obviously didn’t care end friendship. knew acting dramatically angry hurt felt like control body. sh’ed first time month bad. couldn’t stop crying. it’s hour i’ve calmed little bit. i’m filled shame regret. i’m terrified i’ve finally messed thing good. see real feel like every outburst drive away. it’s wonder doesn’t want speak me- everything fight dramatic. know need help can’t get i’m drowning feeling can’t control. thanks reading"

Does anyone have any tips for dealing with boredom that comes with the emptiness?,"i'm *so* bored all the time. nothing really interests me outside of scrolling reddit. and even that isn't true interest. it's just bearable. i rarely leave my apartment when not going to/from work, and hardly socialize at all. hell, i even gave my xbox and television away a few months ago. i text four buddies from high school, and one from work. we never actually hangout.

this is my own fault of course. i'll make plans, but the day of, i remember that i don't enjoy anything and flake out. everytime i think i might want to do something, the thought of ""what's the point?"" floods into my head and i end up doing nothing.

Memory blocking off FP/SO,"i can remember a lot of little details people don't expect me to, and i find it easy to do tests without having to study stuff over and over again; that makes me think maybe i have an above-average memory. 

i remember so many conversations i had with my first fp/so, i still remember his birthday and anecdotes 8 years after not talking. 

when i got a second fp/so, he'd tell me stuff and i wouldn't remember it half of the time, but it was still fine, i don't remember his birthday anymore other than it was in the first half of the year. last time i spoke to this one was 5 years ago. 

the third time i got an fp/so, it was with a guy; after about 3 weeks of talking, i realized i had forgotten his name and the country he was originally from. he got upset when i asked both things, and i kept forgetting so i had to open a notepad and write it down to check every time i forgot.
then i misplaced the notebook and couldn't remember when his birthday was but i knew it was getting close only because we started talking just a couple of days after it and it was in winter, so i had to ask again. i don't remember his birthday anymore or almost any of the stories he told me and we just stopped talking only 2 years ago.

it feels like my mind is putting a block to remembering things about so and it's really frustrating and it honestly scares me because i feel as if my cognition is going downhill but the thing is, my memory is as good as it has always been when it comes to university and other people. it seems directly targeted towards my so.

Free DBT handbooks,"good evening fellow bpd redditors! 

apologies for how long winded the post will be, there is a minimum character length so i will just waffle i guess. 

i realised whilst reading the comments of another thread in r/bpd that some people on this sub may not have access to dbt therapy. 

i saw that in some cases people can’t access dbt because it’s not covered by insurance, issues with affordability or general inability to access the right services. 

i’m from the uk and am currently enrolled in a group dbt therapy course via my district’s nhs mental health practice. i was referred there for diagnosis via my gp last year and they have supported me since i’m the form of the group sessions that take place once a week. the entire course is is 24 weeks in total front start to finish, with weekly 90min sessions via zoom.

the main content that the entire course is focused around is the dbt handbook. it contains all the necessary content including skills practices. 

if anyone would like an electronic copy for free i would be more than happy to share 

i’m not sure the best method to do that so open to suggestions.

started regressing to past behaviours again,"mention of s-icide

at times like this i feel like all the progress i've made the past years didn't even happen.

i had a small argument with my roomate -well not even an argument rather a disagreement, and my response was to just put on my backpack and leave to my parent's place.

i feel very guilty because we had a party two days ago that we hadn't cleaned up yet and now he has to do it by himself, also i know i wasn't right with the disagreement either. but i acted like a child and just fucking ran away from my problems like i usually do.

i just feel suffocated, like i can't turn anywhere where i don't feel like shit, like i can't escape or just hide away if i need to. i feel like i have no freedom in my life or my actions, that i'm just being dragged along and that i'm a supporting character in other people's lives. but i know this is all because of me and i'm the reason i don't feel safe anywhere.

i just needed a sense of control so i left, and went to a pharmacy to take out a bunch of sleeping pills that i was prescribed a while ago but never bought them. the simple thought of having them around me calms me in a weird way, like i am here by choice and not because i don't know any better.

[20F] shame for overreacting. i need advices (recently diagnosed),"i understand this story will not be either particularly intriguing or uncommon, but i need advices, because i’m worried i may ruin a relationship i deeply value.

one of my best friends is also my “friend with benefits”. 
i was under a lot of stress during this month (exams) and some days ago i had to leave for a trip with my family. a trip, which is supposed to be something fun. however, this only brought me even more stress, because my family isn’t easy to deal with and they genuinely drain the life out of me. i love them, but a week is… difficult. 

i was supposed to see this friend the day before leaving, but he forgot due to a couple of reasons (some personal commitments + finished internet connection on his phone), and he also forgot the day after was the day of my departure. this deeply hurt me and i sent a couple of pitiful texts to him and also called him on the verge of crying. he apologised, but later in the day he texted me something on the lines of “i think you overreact a bit, enjoy your trip”.

now i can only think about how a burden i am for the people i love, how little i consider them, how paranoid i am (this wouldn’t have happened if he didn’t finished his internet). he is clueless, not sly, and i have always known it, but somehow i burst. 

i feel shame, so much shame. i won’t see him till the end of this week, maybe even later, and this thing hurts. in a different situation i would have tried to “get back on the horse”, explain myself, spend some good time to faint this shameful memory, but now i can’t and this follows me. the paranoia, in particular: i cannot help myself but think how much easier would be not to have to deal with me at all.

Stopping Medication,"i was taking lamotrigine 100mg twice daily and lexapro 10mg daily, but i had severe memory loss and migraines the entire 9-12 months i was taking these. with my psychiatrist retiring and not being replenished, i've also not had a way to have an adjustment in my prescriptions since the fall. 
i've pretty much weaned off the lamictal within a couple weeks and my memory's back, but i'm extremely paranoid about everything again. i dissociate more frequently and am isolated due to a surgery i had at the end of last month. basically, i fear the world's collapsing anytime i hear my neighbour start their car early in the morning, or i sit in the dark and peer through the blinds tensely to make sure i'm safe when there are noises. everything's scary and unpredictable and nobody's a real person. 
and my therapist doesn't believe i have bpd even though i've been diagnosed by two separate psychiatrists. frankly, i'm not sure if i'll stop going to seek help altogether. 

i feel like every cry for help is ignored.

How can I help/adapt to my partner who has BPD?,"i (m18)recently got together with my partner(f18), who is the love of my life.

we have been together for about 3 months now and we live in 2 diffrent cities about 3 hour drive.

one day she told me that she had bpd, this was very earlie into our relationship. i had no idea what that was so she told me and i asked her how i could help her as i did some research on the subject.

so when i asked her how i could help her, or atleast make it easier, she told me that i cant.

so my question still stands, is there anything, really anything that i can do to help her or adapt to a certain way or anything that i can avoid thats a trigger?

Sobriety and Relationships,"d become sober for my boyfriend; i realized i was putting strain on our relationship, so on his birthday i decided to get rid of all of my substances, and despite the hardships i had in those 6 or 7 months, i managed to stay sober. 

i broke my 6-7 month sobriety because my boyfriend told me he was disappointed in me for going to a party that had weed. i get that weed was bad, but definitely not as bad as what i had been taking. there wasn't any weed left when i had arrived at the party, and i told him that. he told me he was disappointed in me for still going, and it shattered me. i tried so hard to get and stay sober for him, and in the end it didn't matter. he didn't acknowledge how hard i tried. that night, we started arguing and he triggering me and i ended up hard relapsing with drugs i managed to scavenge on my way home. it was terrible. 

the next day, he pretended like he had never been disappointed in me. he even got mad at me for making it seem like it was his fault that i relapsed. i didn't want to sound mean, so i had to pretend that he wasn't the reason i relapsed. i don't know if he ever forgot that day, but i never have. 

today, i sent him a tik tok about going to na meetings since we've been watching euphoria. i told him that i related to rue, which was a mistake because he ended up telling me that if i was rue, then he was everyone that cared about her but couldn't get through to her. i felt bad, i didn't know how to respond to that. i tried to stay sober, and it didn't mean anything to him. and now that my life is falling apart and i have been wanting to do drugs again (i don't think he knows i feel that way), i feel like he's trying to seem like the overly caring boyfriend that wants to take care of me and love me when it's become too late. 

i feel really hurt. we were talking, and i feel like he didn't respond to what i was really saying, just bits and pieces or not at all. i brought up the party, and he didn't respond to it at all. he shifted the entire conversation from it. i mentioned it a lot because it was a super distressing situation for my recovery journey and he wouldn't respond to it. it made me feel unheard and ignored, despite him telling me that he hears me. i'm so tired. i feel exhausted. i'm in that 'let him hurt you' mentality so that i can just stop caring about him and what he thinks because i'm just done. he's hurt me so much, and i'm tired. i've been trying to be passive lately, just trying to get through the day with him. we've been arguing a lot, and today i finally worked up the courage not to give in and vent and talk to him about what's on my mind because i know if we talk about what's on my mind, we'll end up in another argument and i just can't take it anymore. he's really high functioning, and i'm not. i missed 3 days of school because of him last week because of another argument. i'm getting tired. i am tired.",1643609450,False,BPD,2022-01-31 06:10:50,1,0,0,"Sobriety and Relationships d become sober for my boyfriend; i realized i was putting strain on our relationship, so on his birthday i decided to get rid of all of my substances, and despite the hardships i had in those 6 or 7 months, i managed to stay sober.

Psych doesnt want to diagnose,"my psychiatrist admitted they won’t diagnose me as bpd because of stigma even though she believes i could actually have bpd. instead she has stated she’ll diagnose as bipolar 2. eventually in different sessions she seems to be self affirming that it is bipolar 2 as if her repeating “see it really is this” is going to make anything more believable.

i don’t have week long (let alone month long) mood swings, and i barely raise red flags on the bipolar diagnostic survey. however the bpd survey has me marked for every single symptom there is. i’ve started seeing a specialist and am taking group dbt through her shortly.

does anybody else experience this sort of thing with the psychiatrist? it’s not  that i feel i have to have bpd written down, and i do like her, it’s just that it seems she’s trying to convince both of us that it’s not what i think we know it is. seems kind of an odd approach.",1643601356,False,BPD,2022-01-31 03:55:56,1,1,0,"Psych doesnt want to diagnose my psychiatrist admitted they won’t diagnose me as bpd because of stigma even though she believes i could actually have bpd. instead she has stated she’ll diagnose as bipolar 2. eventually in different sessions she seems to be self affirming that it is bipolar 2 as if her repeating “see it really is this” is going to make anything more believable.

My FP is leaving for a spontaneous month-long trip around Europe in the middle of our attempt to heal our friendship.,"so i’ve known my fp for about two and a half years now. we’ve been roommates for a year, and i’ve grown obsessed with him over that time. the thing is, i don’t think he understands the degree of the obsessions that i have for him, and he often does these small things that cause my anxieties and fears to flare up dramatically, often causing me to blow up at him or make a fool of myself trying to explain how i feel. he’s very emotionally distant with me, and it plagues me.
recently, i’ve been trying a new method of communication with him where we write each other letters to detail how we feel about certain things, as part of an exercise toward healing and understanding between us. the letters can get very intense, because we both reveal things that the other didn’t quite realise. he’s mentioned in his that i have a huge stake in his life and that he takes the letters very seriously, but it’s been a week now since i gave him my most recent one, and i haven’t heard back from him.
he’s leaving for a month-long trip around europe in a week, which was a completely spontaneous decision that he made about a week ago. i’m excited for him, but i’m also very anxious about the impending loneliness and the fact that i probably won’t get a letter back from him before he leaves. i’ve asked him to text me pictures now and then of where he is and what he’s doing when he’s there, just to keep in touch, but i have this seething fear that he’s going to neglect to do that.

What would be the best approach delivering news to my friend who will struggle to understand it's not a reflection on her?,"i need to tell my friend that i won't be able to visit her for a couple of months.

I'm so obsessed with him.,"i don't know why and i hate it. well, i do know why, but i shouldn't be this obsessed with him after so long. he was so kind and so easy to talk to. i poured my soul into our conversations and it was everything. i stayed up until 6am each night just so i could see him. 

context: he's my ex bf's(a) best friend(b). a and i had only been dating for a few weeks when he introduced me to his best friend (b). at first we were friendly, and it was great. us and some other people would hang out regularly and all was fine. until i started catching feelings for b. so me and b started hanging out sometimes. nothing ever happened between us, but i could feel something there, and i think he did too (we talked about it very briefly and put it behind us, he neither confirmed nor denied anything). i figured the next best thing to do was break up with my bf, as i obviously didn't love him. 

fast forward to now,  a and i are still friends but i don't talk to b because a gets jealous (even though we aren't dating). but i can't help the urge to reach out. it's been months, i think since november or september or something. i want to so bad. it's gotten to the point where i'll check his location throughout the day, and when he's at home i consider sending him a text. i never do though. i always fantasize about what our lives could be like together. 

in all honesty, i just need a rejection from him to move on. i know he'd never like me, i'm a bitch who's ""hormonal"" and ""over- emotional"" and i suck at everything. i also think i fell for my fantasy version of him, not him. i wouldn't know because we haven't talked in a few months and i've fantasized about him more than i've talked to him now. 

it just sucks, you know? i think about him so mucoh and it hurts. it hurts to not be able to talk to him, and it hurts knowing he'll never like me like i like him, and he'll never know how much i like him.

i'm just stuck running circles in my own mind. i could reach out to him so he could reject me, but then it might circulate back to a and he'd never forgive me. i could just live with this myself, but it eats me up and i hate it. i could try casually talking to him, until i trust that he won't tell anyone. i don't know. i overthinking way too much. i'm just obsessed with this god damn man and he won't get out of my head.

Getting diagnosed,"hey, i’m 18, 19 in a few months. i’ve been trying to get diagnosed for the better part of a year.

i have quite literally every symptom and it’s effected me from a young age, going back as far as late elementary school. 

the issue is, they won’t.. actually diagnose me, due to my age. i’m receiving treatment in the form of medication and therapy geared towards borderline personality disorder treatment, minus the label. while it’s helped some it’s certainly still an issue. 

what should i do? i feel gross saying i’ve probably got it without a diagnosis, but.. it’s really the only thing that explains everything, and quite literally the only reason it isn’t diagnosed is my age. 

while i know it’s not a major issue, it does stress me out quite a bit; it’s ruined my life even when i’m careful and again; everyone i’ve seen has brought it up as a likely cause bht won’t diagnose me as i’m too young.

Found some old screenshots and that was not a good idea,"was looking through some pictures on my phone as i had taken a screenshot of a cookie recipe from back in 2015 and went looking for it because i want to make them this upcoming weekend. i found two different screenshots i had taken. one back in 2015, and the other back in 2016. reading what was on both was not a good idea.

both were from two different people. one had been involved with from 2014-2015, and was toxic. we both knew it was, we both admitted it went on longer than it should have. he acknowledged many times that the way he saw/treated me was unhealthy. the one that i found from him had something similar to what he told me one night over the phone which was “i don’t see you as a person, but just a toy i play with”. it did a serious mind-fuck on me. i’m starting to address how much of an impact it had on me in therapy. and it’s been brought up many, many a times with my psychiatrist over the last five years. needless to say, it did a fair amount of damage. 

the other one was from someone who i’ve been on/off with via e-mail for years! who i refer to as the accountant. not a spicy accountant, but it’s what he’s been doing as a job for the last 20+ years. we’ve known each other since 2015z and unfortunately for part of it i was unmedicated, and when i was, there were zero emotional regulation skills that were being used. so needless to say it goes without say that the screenshot i found from him was him being ultra dismissive and using words against me. that one hurt as well. 

reading both of them triggered me somehow and i had an hour long meltdown. i remembered that back then i had zero respect for myself and would let others hurt me emotionally because i could. i’m slowly working on not letting that happen anymore in therapy.

the accountant and i are in another back on phase right now, and it’s so much more healthier than what we had previously. i was going to email the accountant the one screenshot i found and be all “hey, remember how toxic we were back then? found this and we were not good each other then”. i had the email composed but didn’t press send. because i know if it did, it would bring up a lot of hurt on both our ends. 

i went through some emails we’ve been sending each other the last two years.  i’ve done a lot of self-growth over the last few years both mentally and physically. i ended up making a note on my phone of all the times he’s told me he’s proud of me. and these are two that he’s said to me that mean the most in the last six months.

I hate being alone,"i hate being alone but i've caused so much damage in every relationship that that's exactly where the fuck i've ended up. i feel so confused sometimes because i don't know how things went so bad when i tried so hard for so long, given so much of myself. but at the same time i know what i've done to get here, i remember every mistake, every wrong decision, every single fuck up, i remember them all and i can't blame anyone but myself for the way my life is now.

i've given up on fixing things, i've given up on trying to repair anything with anyone. at this point all i can do is change myself and hope for new things and new people that i can do better with.

My fp contacted me,we’ve been broken up for about a year because he was cheating on me. for awhile i couldn’t leave him alone and he would do the same. i think he liked how much i boosted his ego and how pathetic i seemed everytime i came back. i was starting a kind of relationship with someone else and finding ways to get away from him but we broke things off and i came right back to him. i established boundaries with myself and tried to stay away again but he texted me and said “new year new me” and i absolutely tore into him and told him how i hated him and he apologized for bothering me. the next day he came up on bumble and we matched and i kept profusely apologizing and he casually accepted the apology and proceeded not to answer when i tried to continue the convo. we hadn’t talked after that because i was embarrassed. but he just texted me to ask if i was still logged into his hbo account. we both know i never had access to that account as i had my own. i feel like he’s indirectly communicating to me still to remind me he’s still around or maybe i’m reading too much into things. no matter how much i hate him and never want anything to do with him again there’s nothing i want anything more in the world than to be with him again and show him how much i love him although he doesn’t deserve it. we haven’t texted since the hbo incident and i don’t think he’d answer if i tried. ugh.,1642390235,False,BPD,2022-01-17 03:30:35,1,0,0,My fp contacted me we’ve been broken up for about a year because he was cheating on me. for awhile i couldn’t leave him alone and he would do the same. i think he liked how much i boosted his ego and how pathetic i seemed everytime i came back. i was starting a kind of relationship with someone else and finding ways to get away from him but we broke things off and i came right back to him. i established boundaries with myself and tried to stay away again but he texted me and said “new year new me” and i absolutely tore into him and told him how i hated him and he apologized for bothering me. the next day he came up on bumble and we matched and i kept profusely apologizing and he casually accepted the apology and proceeded not to answer when i tried to continue the convo. we hadn’t talked after that because i was embarrassed. but he just texted me to ask if i was still logged into his hbo account. we both know i never had access to that account as i had my own. i feel like he’s indirectly communicating to me still to remind me he’s still around or maybe i’m reading too much into things. no matter how much i hate him and never want anything to do with him again there’s nothing i want anything more in the world than to be with him again and show him how much i love him although he doesn’t deserve it. we haven’t texted since the hbo incident and i don’t think he’d answer if i tried. ugh.,fp contacted we’ve broken year cheating me. awhile couldn’t leave alone would same. think liked much boosted ego pathetic seemed everytime came back. starting kind relationship someone else finding way get away broke thing came right back him. established boundary tried stay away texted said “new year new me” absolutely tore told hated apologized bothering me. next day came bumble matched kept profusely apologizing casually accepted apology proceeded answer tried continue convo. hadn’t talked embarrassed. texted ask still logged hbo account. know never access account own. feel like he’s indirectly communicating still remind he’s still around maybe i’m reading much things. matter much hate never want anything there’s nothing want anything world show much love although doesn’t deserve it. haven’t texted since hbo incident don’t think he’d answer tried. ugh.

Am i overthinking or rightfully upset??,"hi everyone, so my new boyfriend and i have been together for almost a month now. (i’m the one with bpd). he was my best friend/roommate first and then we established feelings for each other around christmas time. he was super affectionate at first. he got me gifts, seemed genuinely interested in what i had to say and getting to know me more, would send me songs and tell me how much he liked me. he would always try to spend time with me whenever he could. he even said i love you really soon. it seemed right and it felt great.

he’s opened up about his preferences in women, and i’m kinda the opposite of those preferences. i’ve opened up emotionally quite a bit as well and he seems uncomfortable or frozen when i do. he’ll even kinda make jokes about having sex with other women. i’m starting to worry myself and think that maybe now that he’s getting to know me he’s not as attracted to me, and that maybe i was just being lovebombed. but i also tend to overthink things a lot and make things worse than they seem. i wanted to hear what you guys might think, any advice or commentary is appreciated.",1642388551,False,BPD,2022-01-17 03:02:31,1,0,0,"Am i overthinking or rightfully upset?? hi everyone, so my new boyfriend and i have been together for almost a month now.

Honest question - possibly a long one?,"okay, let me list out the following:

1. let's say i've been feeling the scope of how much i'm not a priority in people's lives. which, is okay i guess - for the most part - because i'm in a different time zone to most, and they all have families, etc. i think everyone i know prioritises family, and i don't understand that too much, as because of my life, friends mean everything to me. disparity is there, fine. so, i have been quite understanding of less and less contact. but, when i actually ask for help, fight all instinct and thought to tell them maybe i need a bit more monitoring, or more presences...it doesn't really happen. 

2. i am quite tired of being more active in checking in on  them. bridging the gap, as it were. trying to have a chat, etc. it feels all the more difficult because of my mental state. 

3. it has got to a point where the communication with the people i consider friends is more of a surprise when it happens, as opposed to something i can count on. i should say that i don't talk to them about all the bullshit, just want to have the company - so it isn't always a serious conversation. and i always ask, if it is a serious conversation, if they have the space for it, and definitely tell me when it's too much, which they have done. 

4. i'm feeling the old need to distance myself from people. i am in a bad place, so i am aware that it might just be a symptom showing up. but, at the same time, is it a bad thing? if a need is not being met, and i am counting on it, isn't it better if i learn distance again, and just get by on my own? like i am left to do anyway, feeling that much more alone and isolated? 

5. i guess my question is, is my thinking so skewed that it's a terrible idea to take some quiet time from everyone? i mean, i have already told them that if i am quiet for 3 days, that they should probably reconnect because of what i just recently learnt about emotional permanence and the other thing. i have no reason to think they'll do it, and it's usually me who thinks i should do it so i don't delve deeper into my aloneness. 

any thoughts?

Mad at my FP for Stupid Reason,"cw for self harm mention

i started self harming again because i was full of rage and emotion. he wasn't awake to talk me down and that means the door wasn't open for me to get my feelings out and resolve things so now i'm just stuck here wanting to fix things and wanting to be mad and make him feel bad but ugh,

Should I let go or should I stay?,"my girlfriend with bpd (19f) and i (24m) have only been dating for 2-3 months. the 1st month was bliss and we would be together for a couple of days every week. she was open, affectionate and available. but i’ve felt that after our first trip, she’s been cold and distant. 
it started as saying she can’t text, can’t call, then she can’t stay over anymore, can’t see me on the weekends. holidays rolled in and i’d only get a text/call every other 2-3 days. she would tell me that she’s busy so frequently even during the holidays, she would often say that she needs time alone which i’ve always respected. when i brought up that i felt she’s been drifting away, she told me that i can leave if her schedule doesn’t work for me, i’m taken aback by how reluctant she is to meet me in the middle. she would be the most responsive when she needed to borrow money and/or having a terrible day.

having dealt with family problems on top, i snapped(in text) and told her that she doesn’t do anything for me even when i try to be there for her when she needs it. i apologized the next day having realized that i snapped while she was in class. she told me that she’s on the fence about our relationship, and that when people snap they mean what they say.
after i apologized, she told me she needed time alone. i haven’t been the best at this as i kept asking about ground rules for example, if we’re still exclusive; to which i would get the same answer, she needs time alone. 
because of the lack of something concrete between us, i told her that i won’t message until the weekend only to check on her but also that i’m open if ever she messages first.
we’re having minimal contact now and it’s just me checking up on her as she got covid recently. weekend is up and i’ve been letting her now how sorry i feel for her, that i’m here if she needs me but she’s mostly replying in one words and gets irritable (which she does so often now, but were so talkative in the beginning of the relationship).

i’ve been reading about bpd ever since she brought it up on the first date, and it seems to me that she’s splitting (i really don’t know).
a couple of days back i’ve realized that i can’t really pin my reason to stay on the hopes that the person i’ve met in the beginning would come back. and that i need more communication and physical affection in a relationship, which we’ve been lacking.
i’ve held off in calling her, and/or texting her about this as right now she’s in the hospital. it seems cruel to drop it when she’s the most isolated and vulnerable.
i’ve sent her “i’m here if you need me, get well soon” messages, but i don’t know how to break it off with her or if i should stay in the relationship and wait for her to “come back around”.

"If I’m not invited, I feel unwanted.","i know it’s probably completely something to do with like fear of abandonment or something. 

but a lot of the time if i go to go do stuff, i guess i always feel the need to invite people to stuff specifically? for example if i want to hangout with friends i don’t ever ask “who wants to hangout” to a group of people, rather i ask people one on one.

so sometimes when people don’t do it to me it feels like they don’t want me there, so despite how desperately bad i want to include myself in situations i find it impossible to unless i am asked to join directly? 

and i hate it because i don’t even think it’s that hard to message someone as ask them to do something? like i do it with everyone else so why can’t people do it for me? you know.

this usually ends up with me feeling like i’m the only person that ever asks to see or talk to my friends which results in me withdrawing from them for a few months only to wind back up in the same spot later?

"Opened up about my mental health to a guy I was seeing, he became distant, then I see him in a relationship with a different girl on fb","so i have depression, anxiety and ptsd. i'm almost certain i have bpd but i'm yet to be diagnosed 

i thought i met the guy of my dreams a few months back and we talked non-stop, enjoyed dates together, made plans. after so many shitty relationships and guys, i thought i lucked out. 

i get depression episodes and i've been getting better at getting through them. i was so scared to open up to him but i realised i needed to when i was in the middle of an episode 

i told him what i've been diagnosed with, mentioned my ptsd is from a previous relationship (absolutely no further details) and even though i'm working hard at getting better, i still have my off days. 

i tried to keep it as vague as possible and didn't trauma dump him either. 

but since that moment, it all changed. he'd respond to me less, from texting all day and until late at night to one message a day, then days without a message and then just radio silence 

he messaged me on christmas day weeks later wishing me a merry christmas then radio silence again.

then about a week later i see on his fb he's in a relationship with another girl. i don't know this girl but from the photos on the post she's drop dead gorgeous 

i am...kind of broken. 

i am constantly worried i am not enough and i'm too crazy, mentally ill to ever be loved. 

every other guy previously would outright tell me there's other women they'd much rather be with than me and ghost me after sex. 

i've settled on the decision that i'm just broken and i need to do everything to hide how ill i am. i am just not capable of a loving romantic relationship.

i'm entered a fwb with a guy i work with and it's working well because he's made clear a lot he'd never want a relationship with me and we don't talk outside of us having sex. this is the level i'm right for

New sensory symptoms,"i’m 30, until a year ago i was always treated as having anxiety and depression. meds never really helped, with each crisis meds were increased or changed. 18 months ago i started therapy and it became obvious i had a lot of childhood trauma. a year ago it was suggested i had bpd and that’s why meds had never really been helpful. 6 months ago i was formally diagnosed with bpd and cptsd, i feel like these diagnoses both fit me and my symptoms and experiences.

How to talk about girlfriend's BPD with her,"hey everyone,

my new girlfriend has bpd. she warns me about it often and seems to be worried about how i'm going to react the first time it comes up. i've not minimalised it at all and very much want to be supportive. 

i want to learn more about how bpd affects her own life and what to expect, any advice she might have about how to best handle it when it comes up, etc. the thing is that she seems pretty uncomfortable talking about it and i don't want to push her.

is it me or are all breakups like this?,"posted on like 2 other subs but im so desperate for answers/advice/thoughts and it’s pretty much entirely bpd related because im fucking crazy lol

tldr: i had a messy breakup and now i don’t know what to do because they’ve changed so much and i no longer know where i stand or what i should do. 

i’ve had three serious relationships and they all had the same blueprint. i wasn’t really interested, they confessed, i gave it a shot, i fell in love, my mental illness(es) (depression, anxiety, bpd, the full works) hurt the relationship, messy breakup, they end up hating me, the blame falls on me (though to be honest they weren’t angels either by the end of it). 

all of my exes were (imo or to the best of my memory) really sweet and innocent and i really truly loved them but after the breakup they all changed to the point where i don’t recognise them anymore. like it feels like i didn’t even know who they were, and now that i see them again (irl or on social media) it’s like ??? were you always like that? were you like that when we were together? 

i don’t know if it’s worth mentioning but all of them relied on me in some sort of way wrt mental health (talking them down from panic attacks, helping them figure out how to handle anxiety/depression) because i’ve had a shitshow time with mental illness so i handle it well and i handle their breakdowns well but when it comes to my breakdowns, they can’t handle it no matter how much they promise to stay or stick it through with me. i can handle myself but it most often means shutting down and well consensus is that people dont really enjoy being shut out (which i completely understand). 

am i just fucking these people up like i’m so guilty for what i’ve done (breaking up with them or generally allowing my mental illness to ruin the relationship) even though i rationally know that they didnt exactly do everything right either. 

what hurts the most now is that i still very much love my most recent ex and i know leaving them alone is the best for them, but i still really want to work things out and i want to tell them that i’m really fucking trying my best to be a better person for them but they’ve changed so much like i don’t know what to do anymore because it seems like they’ve moved on. but the last i remember we agreed we were on a break. i really dont want to reach out and ask them about it when i’m not ready yet bc then it’s just another round of hurt for them and if they’ve already moved in then i should just stay away. i’m really just i don’t know i already hate myself enough i don’t know what else i can do to punish myself or let them know that i really am sorry for how things turned out.",1642354120,False,BPD,2022-01-16 17:28:40,1,0,0,"is it me or are all breakups like this? posted on like 2 other subs but im so desperate for answers/advice/thoughts and it’s pretty much entirely bpd related because im fucking crazy lol

BPD barely existant outside of relationship,"hi! so i got diagnosed with depression and anxiety about 2 years ago, and my doctor very loosely said i could have bpd as i suggested it, and now im actually getting an appointment to be tested for it thursday. since that day 2 years ago, i've been paying attention to my symptoms. i even explained it to my ex gf, and she tried understanding me more because my bpd/behavior was basically controlling our relationship.

my bpd ""traits""/all of the symptoms emerged a little after i got into a relationship with my now ex-gf (it was super tough to leave but after like 40 breakups within 3 years, it broke off for good). im guessing because of all the trauma, cheating, lying, she did which made my mind completely fucked... bpd, relationship ptsd idk

anyways, its like a checklist with how spot-on everything is considering bpd. when i found out about bpd, i felt so much relief, despite it being the worst thing to ever come into my life. i believe i have genetic predisposition to bpd and that trauma from my relationship ""woke"" it up??

my worry/tldr: my symtpoms have since mellowed out ever since our relationship ended... and since im getting tested for bpd this thursday, i feel like an asshole/really anxious/upset bc theyre nearly gone now.

Proposal: What should I do ?,"hello,

i have been dating an amazing girl for 11 months now. i suspect she has bpd. last august, she lost her brother (who she described as her father figure), and since then has been unstable. 

last december, she pressured me saying that we cannot continue the relationship without a future, and that if i'm not planning to propose, she would not continue talking to me. so last week i decided to propose. she said that she has to think, because she's not sure about our characters compatibility. when i told her that this was a no, and that i'd rather break up and move-on; she didn't let me go, and said that she didn't say no, that she still loves me, and she was happy to see me. 

i am disoriented and confused. before proposing, when i used to call her, i found her talking late at night on the phone. she swore and promised that it was her sister, but i still have trust issues. my friends shame me for accepting such a bad situation, because ""obviously you're her plan b"". 

i really love her, many friends tell me i should break up and move-on and quit, that i deserve better. anyone who has advice ? 

any advice from people who have bpd ?

BPD in the UK - help please?,"hi guys, my gf is undiagnosed but she's very sure that's what she has, after much reading. what is the process for her to get help? she has been to her gp before but it has not resulted in a diagnosis.

if she manages to get a diagnosis, would that then enable her to get free dbt therapy?

Is avoding relationships a symptom of BPD?,"i have not been diagnosed with bpd, but i am seeing a new therapist in a few days.

in the past, anytime i made a friend i would be really into it for a little while. then i would get bored (and also insecure) and start ghosting them until they stop reaching out to me. i'm very insecure and would have to dress up in makeup just to hang out with friends. it felt like a chore, so i eventually ended up ghosting all my childhood friends. i haven't made a new friend in years. a married couple at my job keep inviting me over (like everyday) and i say no everytime. for no reason.

here's the catch: i don't really like people that much. i don't find them interesting. i'm an introvert and i prefer to spend time alone. however, my mom died when i was only 10 years old. so maybe that made me afraid? i'm scared of the mask mandate being dropped because then my coworkers will see my ugly face for the first time. i might even quit my job when that happens and look for another one. i hate the idea of someone thinking i look a certain way, and then being disappointed when i take the mask off.

Enmeshed after break up (living together/social circle). How can my ex (BPD) and me avoid a catastrophy?,"what do i tell her? go no contact forever? be direct and honest why i broke up, keep it short and simple? motivate her and be extra nice or does it make it harder?

Seeking Support,"sorry if this is a bit long winded. i'm in uk if that helps

i spoke to my gp about going for a diagnosis of bpd and c-ptsd, and while i had to explain everything to him (which triggered me a lot) he said that i fit all 9 criteria for bpd and i definitely experience the symptoms of c-ptsd too. in our first phone call he said he would refer me to the mental health specialist team (mhst) who would direct me in the right place to go and speak to a therapist which i welcomed as i do want help.

a few weeks later in july i had a telephone call with the mhst and the guy on the phone said that, again, i fit all of the criteria for a diagnosis for bpd and c-ptsd, but said that he doesn't want to put a label on it because his ""clients don't like it"". i was a bit taken back by this because as much as i hate having this disorder i would prefer to have a solid diagnosis so i can get proper help. instead, he said this and told me i would be put on a waiting list for anger management and that i would be joining that course at the end of september. 

now, i do understand that mental health services are under pressure but i haven't heard off them since the july appointment and i haven't had any letters inviting me to join the course. i'm stuck at this point in what to do because the letter about me being on the waiting list specifies not to ring them up about the appointment but because it has been nearly 6 months since the call i'm worried that they'll think i don't want the treatment in case they did send out a letter and i didn't receive it.

now, i do understand that mental health services are under pressure but i haven't heard off them since the july appointment and i haven't had any letters inviting me to join the course. i'm stuck at this point in what to do because the letter about me being on the waiting list specifies not to ring them up about the appointment but because it has been nearly 6 months since the call i'm worried that they'll think i don't want the treatment in case they did send out a letter and i didn't receive it. 

should i ring my gp and ask for an update or shall i just continue waiting?","seeking support sorry bit long winded. i'm uk help spoke gp going diagnosis bpd c-ptsd, explain everything (which triggered lot) said fit 9 criterion bpd definitely experience symptom c-ptsd too. first phone call said would refer mental health specialist team (mhst) would direct right place go speak therapist welcomed want help. week later july telephone call mhst guy phone said that, again, fit criterion diagnosis bpd c-ptsd, said want put label ""clients like it"". bit taken back much hate disorder would prefer solid diagnosis get proper help. instead, said told would put waiting list anger management would joining course end september. now, understand mental health service pressure heard since july appointment letter inviting join course. i'm stuck point letter waiting list specifies ring appointment nearly 6 month since call i'm worried they'll think want treatment case send letter receive it. ring gp ask update shall continue waiting?"
I feel like im the devil itself in my partners eyes,"my partner and i have been together for 5 months and we have had a whole lot of ups and downs.

i know that i act out badly alot of the time. and i try to apologize and explain what i was feeling. but i dont feel like he listens to me at all? when im trying to express myself he goes straight to calling me names... like dumb b*tch, toxic, whore or curses at me in every reply. or just saying im making stuff up and calling is bullshit. i feel like he doesnt want to understand my illness and that he just thinks im straight up the devil. 

this makes me feel even worse than before the conversations. i want to genuinly explain myself and apologize. instead of ever hearing me out he goes straight to saying im making excuses and completely dismisses my feelings.  its like he had labeled me as a toxic girlfriend and thats all i am. that its all in black and white and there could be nothing good coming out of my mouth.

alot of the time i feel like he makes my issues about him.. like if something is going on outside of our relationship that im upset about. he makes it about him. in a way were he is ultimately the victim no matter what. if im that terrible and only toxic, why even be with me anymore :(

First time: Psychologist or psychiatrist?,"for the first time you got help, did you go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist?

so will the therapist (psychologist) just refer you out if they think you need more? i don’t want to pay for 2 initial consults because they can be quite expensive, but i also do not want to assume i am going to need a diagnosis.

not sure what to do,"hey! i don’t normally make posts or anything but i’m really worried and i’m not sure where else to find help… i have this internet friend that i’ve gotten really close to in the past year, and we like each other romantically but haven’t set a label to it. a few months ago she told me that she has bpd and since then it’s helped me understand her a bit better… i’ve been trying to research a lot so it can help in case things go back but it looks like i still have a bit of trouble. things have been a little more bumpy than usual since the year started… last night was perfectly fine, it was really good actually, and this morning too. but one thing led to another and she suddenly told me that she thinks we need a break. 

i’m not sure… i asked her if this was just a bad day and she told me that wasn’t the case. i have no idea what to do because… did she really want me to go? did she want to push and keep me away? and i don’t know whether i should actually stay away or push back. i’m worried that i’ll mess up even more. i know that i want to stick with her for as long as i can.

i really love her a lot so this is really tough but i know that she must be feeling a lot worse than i am… she’s really strong and i care for her so much. i’m kind of heartbroken. i keep thinking… maybe she does mean what she says about me. i always try to be patient with her so i haven’t snapped before… she normally reaches out to me again eventually whenever she gets a bit mad at me? is this the same case? because it seems more serious than usual. after she told me she wanted a break i told her that i’ll always be here.

i’d appreciate it if anyone replied with advice or their perspective of things… or anything that can help me understand better. i thought maybe she’s having a splitting episode but i don’t want to assume anything wrong… i’m pretty worried so i hope things can be solved. i want to do my best for her. thank you!",1642325082,False,BPD,2022-01-16 09:24:42,1,0,0,"not sure what to do hey! i don’t normally make posts or anything but i’m really worried and i’m not sure where else to find help… i have this internet friend that i’ve gotten really close to in the past year, and we like each other romantically but haven’t set a label to it. a few months ago she told me that she has bpd and since then it’s helped me understand her a bit better… i’ve been trying to research a lot so it can help in case things go back but it looks like i still have a bit of trouble. things have been a little more bumpy than usual since the year started… last night was perfectly fine, it was really good actually, and this morning too. but one thing led to another and she suddenly told me that she thinks we need a break.

Living with narcissists and having quiet bpd is absolute hell,"i really don’t know what to do at this point i feel like i’m drowning in a sea of 😕 it’s absolute hell to me because they use me as the

so much as see my face then that gives them an excuse to blame me for them being unhappy and it’s affecting me so badly but they don’t care because they’re narcissists. they’re on a mission to destroy each other but all of their weapons are pointed at me even if i try to move out of the way and it’s been stunting me and my emotional growth. i want to be an artist but the way this situation has led

Does anybody know of any good workbooks that deal with BPD and feelings of worthlessness?,"hey folks. first time posting here, was diagnosed late last year (i'm 32) after many years of being treated unsuccessfully for what was assumed to be just chronic garden variety depression and anxiety. i tried a new therapist for a little but the sessions didn't really seem to have any direction or focus, or to go anywhere/achieve anything. i also couldn't afford to keep going with it.

so i'm looking for a self-treatment workbook type of thing, particularly one that focuses on changing deep-seated feelings of worthlessness and deficiency, because this has probably had the most disabling impact on my life and ability to form relationships, and is probably the most prominent feature of my struggles with mental health.

do I have BPD?,"i am aware that this is no place to get ""diagnosed"", but i am probably never going to see a therapist so i just want to know if i may possibly have it or not from people who actually have bpd. so basically, i am a very moody person. my moods can shift quickly. for example, i can feel normal/happy which then can quickly transform into anger and then sadness/depression. i can also be irritable alot of the times and that irritation causes anger. i get angry alot and it is difficult for me to manage it and the simplest things manage to trigger me. one major thing i realized was that whenever i am talking about my problems with someone, i may trust them one day, but then the next day or week i will see them as a liar when they did not do anything to betray my trust. my brain just randomly tells me that someone cant be trusted and so i stop believing in everything they say. one day i can see someone as a friend/ally and the next i can see them as an enemy. for instance, this happened recently where i had became friends with someone and i was happy that we were officially friends. then literally like 2 days later, i do not see them as a friend anymore and i think that they were just lying when they said we could be friends. that same person also told me that i could come talk to her about anything that bothered me and i had trusted and appreciated her the time she said that, but now a few weeks later my thoughts tell me that she was just saying that and was lying to me. there is no one i can trust permanently. it feels like everyone is plotting something against me which is why i just randomly stop trusting people. i also have suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self-harm. i have not harmed myself in any way yet, but i am sure i will one day. i feel empty and hopeless as a person as i have no purpose in life.",1642299757,True,BPD,2022-01-16 02:22:37,1,0,0,"do I have BPD? i am aware that this is no place to get ""diagnosed"", but i am probably never going to see a therapist so i just want to know if i may possibly have it or not from people who actually have bpd. so basically, i am a very moody person. my moods can shift quickly. for example, i can feel normal/happy which then can quickly transform into anger and then sadness/depression. i can also be irritable alot of the times and that irritation causes anger. i get angry alot and it is difficult for me to manage it and the simplest things manage to trigger me. one major thing i realized was that whenever i am talking about my problems with someone, i may trust them one day, but then the next day or week i will see them as a liar when they did not do anything to betray my trust. my brain just randomly tells me that someone cant be trusted and so i stop believing in everything they say. one day i can see someone as a friend/ally and the next i can see them as an enemy. for instance, this happened recently where i had became friends with someone and i was happy that we were officially friends. then literally like 2 days later, i do not see them as a friend anymore and i think that they were just lying when they said we could be friends. that same person also told me that i could come talk to her about anything that bothered me and i had trusted and appreciated her the time she said that, but now a few weeks later my thoughts tell me that she was just saying that and was lying to me. there is no one i can trust permanently. it feels like everyone is plotting something against me which is why i just randomly stop trusting people. i also have suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self-harm. i have not harmed myself in any way yet, but i am sure i will one day. i feel empty and hopeless as a person as i have no purpose in life.","bpd? aware place get ""diagnosed"", probably never going see therapist want know may possibly people actually bpd. basically, moody person. mood shift quickly. example, feel normal/happy quickly transform anger sadness/depression. also irritable alot time irritation cause anger. get angry alot difficult manage simplest thing manage trigger me. one major thing realized whenever talking problem someone, may trust one day, next day week see liar anything betray trust. brain randomly tell someone cant trusted stop believing everything say. one day see someone friend/ally next see enemy. instance, happened recently became friend someone happy officially friends. literally like 2 day later, see friend anymore think lying said could friends. person also told could come talk anything bothered trusted appreciated time said that, week later thought tell saying lying me. one trust permanently. feel like everyone plotting something randomly stop trusting people. also suicidal thought thought self-harm. harmed way yet, sure one day. feel empty hopeless person purpose life."

Anger feels so good to me. I don't know why,"sometimes i fantasize about knocking people's teeth out who hurt me or going on a rampage and beating the shit out of everyone and breaking everything around me.

All my friends get help except for me. Neglected by gp.,"i’m from the uk. 
reached out to a friend who sent me a message days ago bc she saw my “cry for help” post on my instagram. we were talking about when we met and she said “that day i was in a manic episode because i stopped taking my antipsychotics.” 
this made me so sad because she is given antipsychotics medicine which would benefit me so much, when all i’m prescribed is antidepressants. 

she has been diagnosed with bpd a few months ago and she knows i have it. 

now this is the part where you will likely judge me and think less of me by not being officially diagnosed by a health professional. 

when i reached out years ago i was laughed at by the gp and told “this is very hard to diagnose. you do not have it.”
when she said this i stormed out the room because she made me so angry how she was so unnecessarily rude. 
 
now, i am about 3 years older (25) and my mental health is worse than ever. my symptoms have worsen. 

you might think this is strange but i had have 3 friends in total with a bpd diagnosis/ working diagnosis (whatever that means) (1 isn’t part of my life anymore) and this is irrelevant but i just want to say they’re white. i am latina, and you know the stereotype “are very feisty/ south american anger”.  i do believe this stereotype gets in the way of me getting a diagnosis. 

i have multiple diagnosis of mental illnesses. i have bought an essential book that has everything about the disorder because i wanted to know if i have it since i’m always neglected by the gp. i have 8 symptoms that impact my daily life. i am not making this up. years when i found out about this illness i was like “wow i can’t believe there’s a name for all the things that i experience in my life.” it was comforting to know. but my symptoms weren’t as obvious. years go by and i get worse and worse. more self-destructive, irritable, reckless. 

i’ve made these friends years after i knew i had bpd. 

my first time talking to anyone about me having a suspicion about having bpd, after that terrible encounter with the gp that left me feeling worse:

my friend that i had who has bpd i remember one time i told her (i didn’t know she was being diagnosed with it) i told her i think i have it and she said “yeah the other day when you told me // (something i told her about how i act horrible with my partner) // -  wanted to say that because that is not the (my name) i know. 
she was shocked when i told her and something so simple left her thinking i have it.

none of my friends (whom think i am diagnosed with bpd) doubt i don’t have it. 

i understand everyone experiences mental illness different no matter the diagnosis. however i feel so unheard by public health professionals and neglected it makes me wanna k1ll myself. 

i’m so done. if i can’t get a diagnosis for my illness i have no hope because i’m neglected emotionally. what do i do? do i go ahead and seek private healthcare even though it’s much more than i can afford? do i try getting help from the gp again after all these years, and still being given the wrong medication?",1642282890,False,BPD,2022-01-15 21:41:30,1,1,0,"All my friends get help except for me.

Question regarding cheating with BPD,"hi there -

i (22m) don’t have bpd but i’m asking about cheating because i found out my (now) ex boyfriend (22m) with bpd cheated on me throughout the course of our relationship of just under a year with many other people. 

naturally, i got upset and upon finding out broke up with him but since he has messaged me saying things like it’s because of his bpd that he was trying to sabotage the relationship and provoke me to break up with him to punish himself and also that it was meant to liberate me from the relationship because he doesn’t deserve me.

i’m also upset because i found out he cheated earlier in the relationship. it destroyed me and we had a lot of conversations about it - i thought it was a one time thing and expressed to him that if it happens again i’d leave. at the time he also blamed it on his bpd saying he was “testing himself” or something like that and i worked really hard with him to regain my trust in him. however since, i’ve come to learn that he was just manipulating me and continuing to serially cheat. whenever i’d ask him about a guy because he was acting suspect he would be so great at talking to me and putting my mind at ease when in reality my suspicions have turned out to have always been correct.  

my question is does this make sense? i don’t want to believe it’s all due to his bpd because he never told me about the cheating (i found out from a third party and proceeded to look at his phone) and it was continuous throughout the relationship so i can’t imagine he ever actually intended on telling me. 

long story short i’m just confused and ultimately don’t want to believe that this was just a symptom of bpd because he’s blaming everything on his diagnosis and making himself the victim. in my mind i find it hard to believe that he would betray me so much and so willingly to provoke me or free me when he was actively hiding it from me - it feels like he’s just using his diagnosis as a scapegoat for getting caught and had no intention of ever telling me about his infidelity - like he wanted the comfort of our relationship (which on all other accounts was actually quite stable and felt fulfilling and interesting on my part) while also sleeping with other people on the side.

New fp + my BPD backstory,"i thought i was safe from having another favorite person for a while after i got over my ex-boyfriend, which took months to do and required so much hard work pushing him out of my everyday thoughts and so on. it was two days before my birthday when i basically forced myself to be completely over him, knowing it would ruin my birthday if i woke up expecting a ""hbd"" text and didn't end up getting one. it ended up being the first birthday for as long as i can remember where i didn't sob uncontrollably for no particular reason. for some reason the night before, i decided to take one of my friends along with me to meet this guy who she was friends with after we'd exchanged a few texts about potentially seeing each other individually since we had so many mutual friends. as the night progressed, i began to realize how attracted to him i was, which i tend not to take lightly because of how rare it is for me to catch genuine feelings for someone. on a regular day, i'll feel completely asexual until months later i'll randomly meet someone and start to like them. a lot. like to the point where they are all i think about and i become completely obsessed. anyways, we haven't seen each other since then. but he is now without a doubt my new favorite person and has been for almost a month. i once had an fp last for going on three years, and it wasn't fun. i mean, to say the least. i turned down almost every advance i received, even if i did like the person i was getting romantic attention from, it felt as if i was betraying him even though we hadn't spoken in years and he expressed no interest in getting back together with me. i lived my life every day feeling like he was watching me, and could hear everything i said including my internal thoughts. any time i would say something slightly embarrassing even if it was to myself when no one was around, the phrase would repeat in my head until i felt complete and utter shame due to the fact that it always felt like he was watching over me, judging me. i experienced the same thing with my most recent favorite person, and the second i realized it was recurring with the guy i like now, i kind of started to freak out. because we barely know each other. i told him i found him attractive and he seemed excited to go out with me, but for some yet-to-be-discovered reason, i always tend to catch feelings for extremely mentally ill people. like myself, i guess. i thought he was perfectly well, which caused me to mask my true personality in order to seem healthier for him, but he dropped the bomb on me that he went into a depressive episode and doesn't want to accidentally push me away because of how overwhelmed he would get when getting to know someone while feeling like this. i don't know what to do because i am in need of constant reassurance, and i cannot expect that from someone who i recently found out doesn't even consider what we have to be a talking stage. i don't wanna lose feelings for him, as freeing as it would be, this feels so innocent and better for me than any other relationship i've been in. i just want him to feel the same and be expressive of it. i feel so trapped. sucking in my stomach even when no one is looking and feeling like i need to look cute while brushing my teeth because i feel as if he is watching my every move like he's god or something is so dehumanizing even though in a way, i am doing this to myself. sorry if that was rambly and all over the pace but anyone who understands what i am trying to say, can you offer me any help?

How long does your splitting episode usually last?,"i've been diagnosed bpd by 3 separate psychiatrists so at this point i've come to terms with the fact that i probably must have it. 

but i just can't help but shake the feeling that it's still wrong or a misdiagnosis because some of my symptoms are just very different from what other bpd people apparently go through.

first of all i'm quiet bpd so nearly all of my symptoms are inward, and even when i split and ""lash out"" at someone, i keep it to my thoughts which may sound like a blessing to some of you but i guarantee you it's the worst feeling in this universe. 

especially because my ""splitting"" episodes tend to last for very long stretches of time. sometimes it's resolved within a few hours or in a day or two, but often it lasts for weeks or even months at a time in which i'm actively and intensely resentful while outwardly pretending that i'm completely fine. then of course i feel like everything is going great with this person and they're amazing and whatnot for another few days/ occasionally weeks (never really months in my experience for the positive side).

i... i had a really bad point last semester where my insomnia got so bad i went into the hospital for 5 days... i hadn't been diagnosed by then as borderline but it was so horrible; it left me traumatized and my eating disorder (which was getting bad) literally got boosted. i lost 5 pounds in those days. they treated us pretty shitty in there. there was not even a threshold of control over my life and i was losing it. the stress was so big that they put me under the highest dose of temazepam and i still didn't sleep through the night.... i pretend shit was find to get the fuck out of there. and then. after a few days i finally could sleep a bit. drug-heavy sleep, but sleep!!!!!! i was so happy!!!! and it was ok for a few days, even weeks. then the stress lowered and then went up. fast forward a few weeks i started getting sick because of the medication. the dose was too much for my body but there was nothing i could do but wait for the next appointment with my psychiatrist &amp; psychologist. the same ones who were like ""u don't have bpd lol, we've been treating you for years, we would have known"" 🤠

why do i tell you this???? well. my insomnia has been getting bad again and the stress is really getting to me so the medication is not enough. it's really hard for me to go about life these days. my ibs acts up when it wants to. can't fucking sleep.

also!!!! i went to my new psychiatrist and they basically told me to only use clonazepam/klonopin for like when i feel like i really need it. i've been on that medication for years and have used it pretty steadily every single day and it's pretty shitty because my body is like ""gkwkkfkakckwkdiss"". she told me to used dbt skills instead to cope if i can and i just feel so distressed!!!!! there's nothing i can do!!! she also suspects i might have ocd???? wtf really wtf 

like today was my first day at uni and there were so many people it was so overwhelming for me i didn't even think of swallowing the pills in my bag or using coping skills. my face is twitching because of anxiety these days. i can't speak my mind well. i really feel like not waking up tomorrow

Ranting about my distant girlfriend,"i hate when my so feels distant...

we are sometimes on a ldr as she goes to her hometown for a few weeks. but she gets very distant sometimes. takes for ages to respond to my messages, doesn't seem to engage in conversation, etc.

this so hard on me, and i can't rely on telling her that. i feel like im just needy and dependent on her. so i try to just keep it to myself. but as this goes on, i just feel myself splitting. i convince myself that i don't care, and i try not to go around and send her random messages along the day. slowly i fade into  reality (or at least what i make of it) that she is just ignoring me. i get annoyed and i tell her. i feel ashamed of chasing her response and coming around needy...

this repeats through out the times this happens (around a few days at a time). as i express more and more how i don't like that she is distant, the shittier the situation gets. i feel like and absolute ahole for having to remind her of me.

this fades away as she understands we are in fact distant, and things shouldn't be this way. we get to talk as normal. 

this leads me into a few days of doubt and i feel hesitant to message her. i hate this feeling.

deep down i understand that she is busy studying, family, sleeping(as she does short naps throughout the day). but i just can't really deal with my emotions in the short term and tend to close myself. going through it rn and it sucks, i'm in the phase of ignoring her messages after saying that i felt she was being distant (im in shame tbh). 

feeling great despite of that. i'm looking foward to my next appointment as i feel like i'm doing so much progress. just feeling anxious because of uni, no biggie, had worse. and 1 month sober after my last heavy relapse.

My BPD diagnosis confuses people who aren’t psychiatrists,"telling people that i have bpd causes more confusion than clarity - even among therapists that i’ve had. apparently my flavor of bpd is uncommon. i wish that there was a clearer label than ‘bpd’ that i could use to communicate to people.

i have a boyfriend who is currently my fp, i have diagnosed bpd but have been in therapy and it's better. i live in another city for a few months, so my boyfriend and i can only see each other on the weekends.

monday we wanted to talk over the phone, but my head hurt so i said ""maybe tomorrow"". yesterday i kinda lost track of time and my roommate wanted to watch a movie so when it was evening i asked my boyfriend if he wanted to chat, obviously it was too late. 

now he is hurt because i gave him the feeling, that i have other priorities. i always try to make him my top priority but yesterday i kinda lost focus on that and got lost in my own world (was drawing all day) and thought we could talk later or today. i shouldn't have assumed it, it was careless and now i feel awful.

if the roles were reversed i know i would be hurt, so i don't understand why i am like this.
i have been crying the past half hour because my brain won't shut up and i instantly jumped to the conclusion that i am too much of a burden to him...
it was my fault and yet i can't stop acting like a victim.

now he is hurt because i gave him the feeling, that i have other priorities. i always try to make him my top priority but yesterday i kinda lost focus on that and got lost in my own world (was drawing all day) and thought we could talk later or today. i shouldn't have assumed it, it was careless and now i feel awful.

if the roles were reversed i know i would be hurt, so i don't understand why i am like this.
i have been crying the past half hour because my brain won't shut up and i instantly jumped to the conclusion that i am too much of a burden to him...
it was my fault and yet i can't stop acting like a victim.

i know i shouldn't isolate myself but right now i don't want to do what i should do. i hate it that i know what i should do... i have no  excuse to act like i want to act....","really hard act like know came vent, maybe someone something help me. boyfriend currently fp, diagnosed bpd therapy better. live another city months, boyfriend see weekends. monday wanted talk phone, head hurt said ""maybe tomorrow"". yesterday kinda lost track time roommate wanted watch movie evening asked boyfriend wanted chat, obviously late. hurt gave feeling, priorities. always try make top priority yesterday kinda lost focus got lost world (was drawing day) thought could talk later today. assumed it, careless feel awful. role reversed know would hurt, understand like this. cry past half hour brain shut instantly jumped conclusion much burden him... fault yet can't stop acting like victim. know isolate right want do. hate know do... excuse act like want act...."

In response to a comment about splitting,"there was a post by someone asking how they can be more supportive of their pwbpd. reading thru the comments, i came across one that i just wanted to respond to because it's something i struggle with and feel strongly about. i'd like to get some feedback on this if you dont mind.

the comment was giving advice about how to handle splitting. the pwobpd suggested that when an episode arises and the pwbpd starts attacking verbally to ""learn when to...just ignore and let it blow over."" i don't want to use the wrong term and offend, and i'm definitely not saying it doesn't work sometimes, but i think that mindset is lacking emotional intelligence and very unhelpful if not highly damaging to both people.

splitting in bpd is something i don't think most people really understand. overreacting, spitefulness, being an evil psycho bitch, that's what it looks like. but it's not just getting mad and getting even, and it's so much more complicated than black and white thinking. it's the reaction to intense and confusing negative emotions, to feeling persecuted, betrayed, neglected, abandoned. it's so much more than feeling disappointed, let down, ignored, criticized. it's feeling broken and lost and alone. it's hopelessness and frustration that builds into a frenzied desperation to get it out to make it stop to...make it go away by giving it back. it's a culmination of grief, resentment and fear that's directed outward. 

the things that come out of our mouths during an episode.... i have said some really vile, disgusting shit that makes me sick when i think about it. the cruelty and hatefulness i've unleashed on people that i love is something that i'll never forgive myself for. some of them tried to believe me when i apologized, tried to believe that i didn't mean any of it, that it wasn't me but the bpd. but patience wears thin, confidence starts to fade, trust gets broken, love is lost. the willingness and ability to forgive diminish because the disrespect can't be forgotten. splitting can be incredibly destructive because it hurts both people. it's easy to see the damage caused by the pwbpd, but i don't think many realize, understand or really care about how deeply it affects us. 

in a recent relationship, my fp wouldn't feed into my bullshit when i was splitting, he expected it and would wait til i stopped. but the only thing that stopped was the outward expression. i internalized the grief, resentment and fear, added guilt, shame and self-loathing. i hated myself for hurting him when he was trying to understand and accept and love me. i hated myself for loving him when he was causing me to feel that way. it started a chain reaction of self-sabotage. my fears that he would get tired of it and leave brought on crazy paranoia, the thought that he could leave me when i obviously needed him more than ever caused anger that made words not enough. i did a lot of things that i am ashamed of, i lost a lot of respect for myself, i damaged myself. i lost someone who had given me so much, i destroyed pieces of him that he'll never get back, i hurt him in ways that changed him into someone he didn't want to be. 

this is why treatment and therapy are so so important for both people in a bpd relationship. trying to not take everything someone says personal is good advice, but what if they take it personal? ignoring the problem, thinking it'll just blow over and eventually get better doesn't help anyone. without treatment living with bpd is like being stuck in a tar pit, the more you struggle the faster you sink and anyone who tries to help without the right tools will fall in and sink too, and you'll be stuck in the darkness, separated from everyone and everything, and so will they. it's important to know the tools and how to use them to help someone climb out and make sure you're both okay after. 

when it comes to questions about how to deal with bpd in any way, the only answer should be treatment.",1642615619,False,BPD,2022-01-19 18:06:59,1,1,0,"In response to a comment about splitting there was a post by someone asking how they can be more supportive of their pwbpd. reading thru the comments, i came across one that i just wanted to respond to because it's something i struggle with and feel strongly about. i'd like to get some feedback on this if you dont mind.

If you ever feel alone in your diagnosis… just remember,"pete davidson also has bpd. 

you can have amazing relationships with people, and even be a celebrity with bpd. 

there is literally nothing you can’t do, please please don’t let this stand in your way. 

it’s hard and it fucking sucks, but we all have the power to overcome this shit.

they don’t call it remission for a reason, 
 it’s the psychiatric cancer. 

if people are leaving your life and not coming back because of your bpd, then they’re just terrible people. good people understand why you acted the way you did — you may have hurt them yes, but this is different then intentionally inflicting pain. they may take space from you, but they should not write you off because of symptoms which at times you basically can’t control at all. 

our disorder and pain are hard to understand because they are invisible. you don’t where the pain exactly comes from or how to make it stop. physical illness can at least pinpoint a body part or a physical descriptor (as those are more objective).

my advice to all of you is to tell your friends, a professor, or trusted person, call a hotline or tell a stranger, write on here, other subreddits, start a podcast i don’t care, just talk about it. you can be anonymous, you can be a quiet supporter, hell you can donate $1 a year to a bpd foundation for all i care. 

the more we speak about this disorder to people until they widely (or at least half decently) understand how bpd (and did, bipolar, and other mood/personality disorders) works, manifests, and hurts ourselves and others. people do not know the strength it takes to walk every day living like this. i think we can all agree that it feels like we are living in a forever hell.

apologize for your symptoms, often. thank those who help you along, tell people what may or may not happen. hope for the best, prepare for the worst. don’t shy away from this. because the more we do the more it consumes us. 

we are our own best advocates. the more people know, the more they will be able to help. 

we have to fight for awareness and visibility. 

you are not alone. 
we are not alone. 

we just need everyone to know is that sometimes all we know is how to be alone. 

loneliness is our biggest cry for help. 

mental health is getting so much more attention and importance placed onto it every passing day, and we deserve to be a part of that increased awareness. 

we deserve love, compassion, laughs, hugs, smiles, happy thoughts, and eyes always looking up towards our futures.

we can do it, we can make a world that will be more kind to those who suffer with bpd.

My best friend of 8 years turned her back on me.,"she’s a super important friend of mine - the kind that helps me move house at 2am, the kind that took me  in when my father chased me out years ago. (of cos i’m just naming the two specific examples and it doesn’t means this is our usual dynamic)

after we started working (and due to her extremely introverted nature) we can go days without talking, then weeks, then months….

on may 2021 i met her and everything seemed fine, but we went home and she just started fading off again - i thought it was normal.

but september came when we were supposed fo collect our graduation gowns together - when i texted her she just said she alr collected, and when i asked why? she didn’t reply. i also asked if she was free for dinner and she simply said no.

i guess i was hurt, then october her birthday passed i didn’t say anything.  by november she changed her netflix acc and that was that.

knowing her she’s the kind to avoid confrontations, and i missed her, so i decided to just pretend nothing happen - last week i sent her a random pic of this pen i got her last year (our inside joke but never had a chance tk pass to her). she didn’t reply. so yesterday i texted her casually asking her to go to the movies saying i’ve extra tickets, and lightheartedly said let’s go next week! 

she simply replied “nope i don’t want to go”.

ouchhhhhhhh……… i don’t usually get close to peolle and the few friends i have i cherish. but i’m not sure what has happened here.

i don’t wish to confront her either knowing she won’t reciprocate - and this has triggered my abandonment issues so bad. abrupt as it may seem (since nth happened) deep inside i knew that maybe she was tired of me and this was accumulated. maybe i’m just too much for her.

reminded me of the times when she used to just “disappear” when i get emotional (such as going through a breakup etc) but i always told myself that it’s fine, perhaps she just hates such emotional situations and she’s always there when i needed real help.

Some insight?,"i made this account recently. might not be able to reply to comments. me and my ex broke up about 6 weeks ago. together for 6 years. married for 4. and we have a child together. she's broken up with me numerous times over the years. and there was almost always another man involved during the course of our break ups that pretty much never lasted more then 3 or 4 weeks. this times a little different and i'm a little worried. 

she moved on immediately after the break up. which honestly i'm used to. but it's ramped up quite a bit. she's been with him just over a month, planning on moving in together, and she's actively trying to get pregnant. since i've met her she seems to have a small episode every 4 to 6 weeks. and every 6 to 12 months it's a much larger, world turning upsidedown event. 

her and i (moreso me) really started digging into what bpd is during our last breakup about 4 months ago. she was going to start working on herself but didn't follow through. shes throughly convinced what she's doing is in no way bpd related, she won't regret it and knows what she's doing. but she's always said that. i've been trying to be as supportive in what she's up to as much as i can but i'm afraid she's spiralling out of control and i'm just letting it happen. 

i mean she does seem happy. and i know there's nothing i can actually do. i don't even know what i'm looking to get out of this post because i'm pretty powerless in making her see things from the outside looking in. but at the same time it seems like enough time has come and gone and if it was another episode she would have snapped out of it by now. she's been pretty consistent the last 6 weeks minus a couple unexpected behaviors. i just want her to be ok and not ruin her life.",1642586863,False,BPD,2022-01-19 10:07:43,0,0,0,"Some insight? i made this account recently. might not be able to reply to comments. me and my ex broke up about 6 weeks ago. together for 6 years. married for 4. and we have a child together. she's broken up with me numerous times over the years. and there was almost always another man involved during the course of our break ups that pretty much never lasted more then 3 or 4 weeks. this times a little different and i'm a little worried.

Roommates happier when I’m not with them,"hello,

i was wondering if anyone has experience dealing with roommates who are happier when you’re not around? i know it’s typical for us to believe people are happier without us, but ever since i started shutting myself off from them (around a week ago) i hear so much laughter in the communal areas, people are more active in the group chat, and one person who almost never leaves their room is almost always in the communal area. i could go on for concrete examples of how this isn’t just my bpd saying they like it when i’m not there, but i think you get the point.

i just feel so alone in my room, but in a way i’ve never felt before; it’s a different type of loneliness when i can hear them laughing when they wouldn’t if i were there. i try to get out of the house but the acknowledgment that i’m running from the problem doesn’t come long after.

i’ve went through ways of talking to them to reach a common ground, but every situation i imagine just leads to someone being upset.

I think I might have BPD,"ive been doing research on bpd lately and taking tests (i know the tests aren’t accurate but they’re giving me a good idea of what i might have) and i think i might have it. of course i won’t know for sure until i am professionally tested, but i already have depression and anxiety so i’m pretty bad as is. i’m just wondering if i have bpd because for the past couple months i’ve been going through mood swings and things that aren’t normal even with my depression and anxiety. 

so i have this person i really like, and these past few months i’ve been back and forth between absolutely hating them, like everything they do makes me hate them and i don’t even want to talk to them, and then an hour or so or even days later i’ll love them again. this happens with everyone i talk to, but mostly my online friends since those are the only friends i have. but even though it happens with everyone, it happens the strongest with that one person. i feel so bad but i can’t help it. 

another thing i do is cry, and i always cried all the time before but now it seems i do it more often. my mood is constantly either super great or i feel so down.  it feels different from what my depression usually makes me feel. my depression does that but now i feel manic and i’ve been doing things such as stabbing my blankets and laughing while crying i just feel so off. 

but yes although this all weirds me because i’ve never really been this different before, the one thing i really need to know is why i feel such a strong change in my mood towards people, especially that one person. thanks for anybody who read and is willing to help! :)",1642578038,False,BPD,2022-01-19 07:40:38,1,0,0,"I think I might have BPD ive been doing research on bpd lately and taking tests (i know the tests aren’t accurate but they’re giving me a good idea of what i might have) and i think i might have it. of course i won’t know for sure until i am professionally tested, but i already have depression and anxiety so i’m pretty bad as is. i’m just wondering if i have bpd because for the past couple months i’ve been going through mood swings and things that aren’t normal even with my depression and anxiety.

Don't know who I am after a breakup,"about two years ago i started to try and be a person i liked. i dressed the way i wanted, i started creating things, and i tried to find hobbies that brought me joy. it wouldn't be right to say i'd totally sorted myself, but i was at least on the right path. then around a year ago i got into a relationship, and it seemed like everything was great. honestly i was kinda hooked on this person from not long after we met, every little thing about them fascinated me. despite this, at first my life felt at least somewhat balanced. 

then slowly i felt everything start to revolve around this person. i lost friends, i stopped pursuing hobbies, and i forgot about my interests. sometimes it kinda felt like almost everything was just in pursuit of spending time with them. the issue was they were happy to spend all the time in the world with me, but it kinda felt like they started to thrive from it, while i just kinda stagnated.

anyway i had a bit of a crisis a few months ago and broke up with them. i've never felt so hollow in my life. the only way i can describe it is feeling like an empty puppet. i still have all these external and superficial qualities i had before, but there's nothing driving me inside if that makes sense. every time i try and pick up an old interest there's no real spark.

i need to rebuild myself but i don't know how. i'm at uni and the workload is quite intense, and it feels like there's no time left over to work on myself. but then when i've got nothing to do i just kinda wallow. what doesn't help is that this person is still this perfect figure in my mind and all i can think about is how much i want them back.

"I am trying to communicate and I don't want to send mixed messages, however I am trying to convey a dialectical.","i am trying to reply to a girl who ghosted me for a little over a week and then reached out explaining what happened after i asked.

it's been a day and a half, going on two days that i have been pondering this and experimenting with word choice. it's rather difficult to convey what i want to convey because i was really hurt by how she treated me and i need time to get over it, but i would want to be her friend at some point. i also don't know when i'd reach out to her or when she'd reach out to me or what this would even look like going forward.

i don't want to be her plan b in case her guy who came out of the cobwebs doesn't work out. maybe she was the flaky one and not him, who knows. but that's irrelevant to this problem solving.

This cycle is terrible,"i'm having a really rough time. once, a while ago, i had a great relationship that fell apart pretty suddenly. they handled it poorly, i handled it poorly, and in the end because i didn't know how to handle it properly, they were able to convince everyone of our mutual friends (every friend i has at the time) that the lies they spread about me were true. i lost everyone. now i'm in this terrible cycle. i'll get a friend, allow myself to care about them, then if something changes or starts to differ from how it was, like all friendships do, my mind will make me think they have secret resentment for me or are starting to dislike me. they'll then get annoyed by me asking about it, which will cause me to worry even more and cause my worries to become more frequent until eventually the whole friendship falls apart. it's a self fulfilling prophecy of a cycle where each time reinforces the next. it feels awful every time, but worse is the effect it has on the people i cared about. it's horrible seeing how frustrated, angry and upset the whole cycle makes them. and i can't even tell them how sorry i am because i can't stop these things from getting worse instead of better after every talk we have about it. 

i've been through 4 of these cycles and am now at the close of the fifth. this person is the best friend i've ever had. we only knew each other for a year, but we became very close quite quickly. she did more for me and put up with more from me than anyone could ever be expected to. we supported eachother through hard times and laughed through great times. she's an amazing person who deserves a friend so much better than me and i love her so much. maybe it was the speed at which we became friends, but i've been worried for a while that we'd fall apart just as quickly. and sure enough, my mind jumped at the opportunity to make me panic and soon, the talks we had to reassure me got more and more frequent to the point where it was an every day occurrence. soon, she started to feel like i was blaming her for things she didn't do and eventually she was just tired of the whole thing. and somehow, the worst part for me is that she still cares about me even through all of this and i can't stop making it worse. the only thing that would stop it is to do nothing, but every day of that causes me nothing but stress and anxiety. i just want things to go back to how they were before i stopped believing the friendship was stable and before she had to worry about being careful about literally everything she said around me. we just recently had a huge argument that lead to us not seeing each other for a week. part of me is hoping that this will give me a chance to refocus and maybe make things better next time we talk, but part of me is worried that either she'll realize how much easier things are without the constant need to worry about me, or that i'll feel like we're more distant than ever when this is over and not be able to handle the change. i want to be better, i want to make things better between us, but mostly, i want to stop causing the most genuinely kind and wonderful person i know, the person who i fully believe most deserves happiness, to be without it so often.

I’ve realised I’m actually in love and I’m scared,"so i’ve been in a relationship with my partner for about a year and a half now. to clarify my relationships have always lasted at most a year, because i fall in love with the idea of them and then realise they’re actually assholes to me. before i even met my current partner i was head over heels, he was cute, he could carry me around, ect. and about a month after we met we started dating. 

it took about the usual three months for me to realise that maybe i’m not in love with him, but the idea of him. i had the usual period of feeling empty and numb, i loved the affection and intimacy but did i really love him? i kept going with the relationship because he was actually nice to me and i craved positive affection. 

well yesterday, i realised that i am actually very very in love with him, like i love him, not just the idea of him, and he loved me. at this realisation i almost started crying, because i was scared, and overwhelmed. because if i truly love him, then i’m very vulnerable to having my heart broken, i’m open to having the first time i’m actually in love taken from me. i’m so scared of this vulnerability that i don’t know if i should break up with him.

note: i don’t really feel emotions properly, i can hardly tell what i’m feeling or if i’m feeling anything at all. i’m pretty sure i’ve been in love with him for at least half a year but didn’t realise it as all emotions are like jumbled messes to me. i don’t know if this is because of my bpd or my autism, maybe even both.

Going to therapy this Wednesday and I’m Terrified,"i haven’t been to therapy in a while. last time i saw one i got the feeling she was just downright lazy, because she would never do or recommend anything. my two other therapists before that one were ok, but i didn’t feel like i got much out of it.
recently my dad’s insurance switched because he got a new job, which means we had to switch psychiatrists because i’m still on his insurance. the new psychiatrist listened to me explain my past and at the end she very urgently suggested i see a therapist asap, and got me booked with one in her same office.
i’m very nervous. first of all because i rely on my medication to help me with adhd, and i’m afraid they’re gonna talk to each other to find a reason to get me off my meds or try something different when what i’m on has been working just fine. things like this have happened to me before.
i’m also just really terrified of opening up. even answering some basic questions about my past with the psychiatrist yesterday made me want to cry. i have finally achieved some level of stability by working through my problems on my own, with reassurance and support from my partner. i don’t want some random lady digging into my past and making my life harder by having me remember shit when i’m not ready. i hate that about therapists. they act as if it’s some kind of special relationship. bitch i’m fucking paying you. and you will forget me the second i stop paying you. also, from my experience they just sit there and expect me to do all the talking? like homie i can fucking write in a diary if i wanted to monologue. how about you actually give me answers when i ask you questions instead of making vague statements that are supposed to mimic support? 
as you can see i have a bit of residual anger left from my previous experiences. i do respect the therapy profession, even tho it may not seem like it in this post. my sister has had some amazing therapists and she herself is working towards becoming one. so i’m not hateful towards all therapists. i’m just scared. i don’t want to do it. i don’t want to remember things. i don’t want to feel pain anymore. nowadays when i feel pain, i can manage it, because it’s measured at my own pace. but if i have to talk about it all with a therapist, it can make my life harder when i leave the therapist’s office. because i have to work. i have shit to do. i don’t wanna have to leave work bc i’m having a breakdown bc my therapist and i decided to talk about my relationship with my parents that morning",1642548102,False,BPD,2022-01-18 23:21:42,1,1,1,"Going to therapy this Wednesday and I’m Terrified i haven’t been to therapy in a while. last time i saw one i got the feeling she was just downright lazy, because she would never do or recommend anything. my two other therapists before that one were ok, but i didn’t feel like i got much out of it.

"I know I'm handling this appropriately, but hooooly moly is self-doubt a thing.","my kid attended a 4 day leisure program a few weeks back over the break. she struggled when she was there, but i was being told conflicting things. for example, one person said she had covered her ears and screamed a couple times during the morning while another said she had been hysterical all day. i was told she had a great day one day and the next day i was told that she had been crying every single day she had been there. i was obviously upset to learn this at the end of the week and said that i needed a clear picture, please.

i talked to someone in management when the staff were unable to provide me with a written copy of what had been happening and the write up i was permitted to see only and not copy was full of ambiguity and conflicting information any way. the manager was helpful and we came up with a plan -- they would get me a quick little write up of the week's happenings so that i could bring it forward to a doc or counselor to get my kiddo the supports she may need since we are only just getting her in to social settings like this as the pandemic eases up. she has special needs, so now is when we can see what sensory and attention issues are happening, and i want to make sure we can provide her with what she needs to be comfortable and succeed in what she wants to pursue in life. this is the second time she has struggled during a drop-off recreational program- different companies- so i know that we should be looking at what is going on or at least be tracking it. 

i have left four voicemails over three weeks since, and i was finally answered to be told that they needed another 6 days to provide me the information due to staff absence. i've heard nothing since, so i left another voicemail with the manager reminding them that my daughter's doc appointment was coming up- something i mentioned when we spoke... and nothing. so i've left a voice mail with the owner. and i am stressed. 

i know that i have been handling this well. i've been making sure that i'm keeping my correspondences polite and to the point. i keep saying that i understand times are chaotic right now with the pandemic. i've explained that i just want a timeline of when this information will be available to me so that i can book the appropriate appointment with my daughter's pediatrician. i've had one come and go already. i paid the doc just to let her know that information will be coming because my daughter had a very rough time in a social setting. 

it's just so frustrating because i am doubting myself constantly, and my paranoia is flaring huge. i'm scared they're going to throw us out of the other programs she and i attend through them. i'm scared that because we pay a subsidized amount that they are going to treat me rudely. i'm scared of... i don't know. everything? so i just want to walk away from this because the unfairness of this is making me want to explode in rage and i just... don't want to bpd all over the place, you know? but i need to figure out how to remind myself that i'm not wanting to keep myself ""in check"" - i have every right to be pissed off - it's just that i am wanting to stay effective in handling this. and i know i have been, but all that self-doubt makes me spin - why bother the owner anyway? so then i beat on myself for not being mature enough to handle this or causing a big deal when there isn't one... except that i am handling this very, very well... i think... i don't know... and i think this is a big deal. i wish i trusted myself more. frick.",1642547730,False,BPD,2022-01-18 23:15:30,1,0,0,"I know I'm handling this appropriately, but hooooly moly is self-doubt a thing. my kid attended a 4 day leisure program a few weeks back over the break. she struggled when she was there, but i was being told conflicting things. for example, one person said she had covered her ears and screamed a couple times during the morning while another said she had been hysterical all day. i was told she had a great day one day and the next day i was told that she had been crying every single day she had been there. i was obviously upset to learn this at the end of the week and said that i needed a clear picture, please.

People with BPD are not narcissists!!,"ugh, it just makes me so sick when people say that.  or when people say npd and bpd are cousins. ugh! 

i understand that certain actions we do might look similar, but it's completely different reasons why we do things we do than them.  we dont do things because we have some inflated opinion of ourselves, its the exact opposite of that! we do things because we're insecure and live in fear of our people leaving us everyday! we don't want admiration, we want reassurance to make us feel secure, so we know you won't leave! we don't feel self-important,  we have a lack of emotional permanence so we don't understand bond, so we actually dont feel important to anyone and that's why we seek that reassurance out, because want to know we mean something to you!

for example, i like people who are very clingy and obsessive to me, not because of full of myself and like the attention. its because they makes me feel wanted, it makes me feel secure like they really care about me. if they are this clingy, then they definitely would never leave me! everything ties into that intense fear of abandonment, not arrogance, not narcissism. 

that search for reassurance can be extremely toxic, but that doesn't mean we are narcissists! we are complete opposite of them in mindset. alot of us think we actually don't deserve love and that ties into the fear of abandonment, because why would someone put up with us? that's a question in my mind all the time.

i was certain it was them .. so i threw a huge fit, blasted metalcore (which i’m not very sure they listen often to) and was just yelling.. i called my so, which was at least their to hear me vent .. it calmed me a bit

How do I stop splitting?,"so basically i am mad at my dad for the stupidest reason ever. he told me he would get me a new car when i get my drivers license and the second i got it he was like : “you’re not allowed to use it alone, yet”. then what is the freaking point of having a new car and not being allowed to use it. i have to practice more with him but he is busy all the time. 

my mom said it’s because of my own safety and she has a point but i am still mad at my dad for telling me i need to practice more after i got my license and not while i was still in the process of getting it. i was so excited because i was going to be able to save a lot of money on ubers + i was planning to ask my boss for a raise and use that opportunity to ask her for a “bonus” for the gas, as my job requieres me to move a lot during the day (i am an architect and i have to do site-visits, but stuff, make payments, etc). 

i can’t see my dad. wherever i am around him i am super irritated and i don’t want to talk to him. and i hate it because my dad is the most supportive person and he loves me a lot and now i feel super guilty for splitting because i know he doesn’t deserve to be treated like that.

BPD and quitting nicotine,"hi guys,

i’m not sure if anyone has dealt with this or has any advice, but i need some support.

so basically i’ve been vaping for about 6 years. i’m about to turn 20 in less than a month and i’m not trying to go into my 20s with this stupid addiction.
my boyfriend and i decided that we would both quit together while we go long distance for a few months. so the day of his flight was our quit day.
so i quit for about 5 days and then caved today and bought a new vape.
i feel guilty about it, but i was seriously struggling the last 5 days.

the cravings weren’t even that bad, but i couldn’t deal with not having i guess what has been a comfort item and coping mechanism. i started slipping back into old negative habits, like not eating, not taking care of myself, not really doing anything.
it threw me back into who i am in deep depressions. 
i was splitting so hard and having crazy mood swings and yesterday i couldn’t even get myself out of bed to take a piss. it took me until i was literally in tears of pain from holding my bladder to get me out of bed.
so basically, what im hoping for is maybe some tips on how to quit without it turning into that. i’ve worked so hard through all of this covid stuff to become a good person who is in control of her emotions and reactions and be a generally happy person.
in the past 2 years i went from everyday being a 2/10 to everyday being almost a 10/10. there has been so much progress with my bpd and i really really don’t want to lose that over quitting vaping. 
so please, if you’ve gone through this or have any tips on getting rid of a negative coping mechanism, let me know!

Angry but choose not to do anything,"yesterday i had a very triggering moment with my ex. we met another couple at a party awhile back and made plans to meet but never got the chance. they texted us in a group chat asking to make some plans. 

he (hasn’t spoken a word to me in weeks) but wrote a draft of a text to send them and wanted to ‘clear it’ by me.
in it he wrote something like ‘we’ve split but we’re on good terms and hope to meet individually…’ 

i impulsively snapped and wrote back “you can take out the ‘on good terms” and then he didn’t respond.

i felt so angry. he hasn’t spoken to me or made an effort at all to know how i’m doing- but to strangers he wants to play pretend that all is good and well. i almost wrote a tirade of text messages echoing this exact sentiment but at the same time something clicked in my brain that said ‘you can be angry and choose not to do anything’.

so i washed my face with cold water in the bathroom and finally just felt that space in between thought and impulse. i can feel anger and still choose not to do anything.

it’s been a full 24 hours and no tirade of text messages yet. pre-dbt me would have cracked at midnight and spent all night writing some intense accusatory letter but post-dbt me is chilling.

Taking break from FP,"last night, my fp did something that made me split pretty badly. we had been playing video games for like several hours when he told me that he was going to go play something with his other friends. this has happened before and usually it doesn't affect me this bad, but last night was not very good. luckily i didn't freak out at him, but for the rest of the night i was pretty miserable. i don't think it was helped by the fact that throughout our time together, he was talking a lot about his other friends. one of the worst things about me is that i'm a very jealous person, and some days when he talks about his other friends, it makes me terribly jealous. it makes me think that he'd rather be hanging out with them than me. 

anyways, the whole reason i'm writing this is because i need some advice. whenever i get these sort of feelings, i feel the urge to distance myself from him. i know it's a bad coping mechanism for people with bpd, but i also feel it could do me some good to take a few days or a week or however long away, and then return when i'm not feeling as bad. is this a bad way of coping? i did it several months back where i took around a month away and when i returned everything was fine. i'm just scared that if i do it a second time he'll hate me. i think when he left to play with his friends, i may have come across as upset but i'm not sure if he picked up on it and i don't want that to be the last impression. any input would be great.",1642528434,False,BPD,2022-01-18 17:53:54,1,0,0,"Taking break from FP last night, my fp did something that made me split pretty badly. we had been playing video games for like several hours when he told me that he was going to go play something with his other friends. this has happened before and usually it doesn't affect me this bad, but last night was not very good. luckily i didn't freak out at him, but for the rest of the night i was pretty miserable. i don't think it was helped by the fact that throughout our time together, he was talking a lot about his other friends. one of the worst things about me is that i'm a very jealous person, and some days when he talks about his other friends, it makes me terribly jealous. it makes me think that he'd rather be hanging out with them than me.

Struggling With My FP,"disclaimer: i haven’t been diagnosed with bpd yet but do exhibit many of the symptoms. i go to therapy to unofficially treat it with dbt and many of the bpd coping mechanisms have helped me tremendously. 

the one thing i still struggle with is the concept of an fp, i have always struggled with these intense attachments to certain people due to my isolated childhood, abandonment, etc… after years of mistakes, i now understand that my intense attachment to these people are not normal thus certain actions i think about should not be taken however it doesn’t dampen my attachment either. 
my current fp is an online friend i met about two years ago. he’s such a kind and wonderful person who i have a lot in common with. a few months ago, i expressed my romantic interest in him and was politely rejected but i can’t seem to get over him. i don’t even think i want him romantically anymore but it’s clear that my emotions are attached his actions. when we talk, i’m happy and feel content but when we aren’t, i desperately crave his attention and start to feel more depressed the longer we don’t speak to each other which i know isn’t normal. 
it’s very confusing because i want him to crave my attention as much as i crave his but proceed to feel disgusted with myself because i know i only feel this way due to mental illness. i want to be his best friend but also know that i probably won’t be more than just “one of his many online pals”. it’s either we are each other’s world or he doesn’t even see as more than passing entertainment he’ll eventually get bored of. i’m so tired of these relationships feeling so one-sided due to this illness, tired of obsessing over him even when i try not to.

seems like my bpd ruins everything :(,"my last two relationships ended very similarly, with them both feeling like they couldn’t talk to me about my bpd symptoms affecting our relationship and bottling up all of that pain inside, only to blow up and break up with me suddenly without me even knowing what’s going on. it’s hard for me to know which of my emotions are worth holding on to or are valid, and right off the bat i tell people who i start dating about this and to tell me when i’m getting to be too much because a lot of the time i genuinely can’t tell. but what if i just end up scaring the people i love too much to the point where they aren’t comfortable sharing how they truly feel with me? i feel like my break ups would have been avoided if my ex partners were able to tell me how they felt. i would have understood and done everything i could to change things and to learn and grow. i just. i’m so tired of pushing people away. 

i even told my last ex partner before we started dating about what happened with my ex before, and how he ended up bottling up emotions concerning my bpd symptoms and how my emotions weighed on him and then broke up with me suddenly without working through things with me, only giving symptoms of my bpd as reasons (even when he promised me he would never break up with me due to my mental illnesses). i told my last ex how i wanted to avoid that and he promised me he would tell me if things got to be too much… and then he didn’t anyway :(

i’m feeling pretty hopeless right now. i really wish i didn’t have bpd. i miss both my ex’s and i really don’t think i’ll ever get over them. idk if i can take more of this pain. i feel like i’m gunna end up alone because of my bpd. if i didn’t have bpd i would probably still be with either of my last two ex’s. i’m so broken because of this stuff and i just. don’t want bpd to affect my relationships like it has been anymore. i just want to end up with someone forever and be able to communicate freely with each other and that seems to be impossible for the people i date :(

yesterday my last ex told me i made him into a monster and i made him into a worse person because my emotions were so unstable. i just. i don’t know how to deal with that. i have nothing but love in my heart for him and i care about him so much… i don’t know. i’m doing a lot better than before and i’ve gone through dbt and i’ve been working through my issues and trying my best… but i still managed to fuck this up and push away yet another person who i love the most. 

i know i deserve better over all and i deserve people who will be open about their feelings to me instead of bottling them up until it’s too late, i just hate that this has happened twice with me now and i can’t do anything about it. and i get so attached to the people i date and i just want to stay in my room and cry all day because they don’t love me anymore. i still can’t believe they don’t love me anymore :(

i started a new job on dec 31st and i’m already ready to quit. there’s a few things within the company that i don’t agree with, but i enjoy the job itself. but i’ve still lost complete motivation. 

i haven’t made the effort to see my best friend in weeks. so i feel absolutely terrible about that. do i reach out to her? no. i let myself wallow in fucking misery.

i’m getting back on the verge of wanting to end it all again. im 26 years old and feel like my life is going nowhere. i just want to replace my head. i hate myself and the way my brain is wired. i hate that i’m not “normal” and i’m just exhausted from having to continually work on adjusting my behaviour and feelings. 

im just so tired of everything. i don’t want to do this anymore. people keep saying “oh, it’ll get better and easier” but when??? ffs. i don’t want to do this anymore. i don’t want to keep fighting. im exhausted and tired. i don’t want to fight anymore. but then i’ll be a failure who gave up. even though i already feel like a failure.

I want to go home,"i find myself wishing often to go home. the problem is i've never had a stable home since i was 2 years old. i once lived happily with my parents in a little house on a hill. but because my father could never be satisfied with what he had, he went chasing after a dream that didn't exist. and he dragged us along. 

nine moves in nineteen years. three schools in one year in two different countries. and the only thing that accomplished for me was a never ending sense of instability and never developing lasting friendships. what was the point of making friends if i was going to be saying goodbye to them in a short time anyway?

even in the place we lived the longest, i never found a sense of belonging or community. in college i got something of that. but one car crash destroyed that for me and i left that place forever to never look back.

I don't even know... like... I just don't,"please don't hate me for this

ok so i have never been to therapy (talked to therapists, but no consistent therapy) and am undiagnosed but there are several serious things going with my mental health, for at least 6 years now. i could spill the words depression, social anxiety and more, but like i said i am undiagnosed and i do not under any circumstances support self diagnosing.

and the thing is: i am struggling so so much, for so so long now. over the years i gathered a lot of knowledge about psychology, i've read books and research papers, had friends with depression, anxiety, ed, bpd and more, i am part of internet communities where mental illness is discussed and please don't hate me for what i am gonna say... i am very sure that i have bpd. i do not consider myself as a person with bpd, i do not support self-diagnosing and i do not claim to have bpd. i am just desperate to the core. there are so many reasons why i dodged therapy for at least 6 long years now and i am well aware that therapy is the way to go for me, there is no other way, i know. it's just so difficult, every single day is a struggle, i am overwhelmed, i don't know who i am, i am scared, i am confused, i feel like i am not sick enough to deserve treatment, i am longing for safety, i hate myself, i can't admit the fact that sometimes i don't hate myself, i am so so so tired. and i don't even know what i am typing here, why i am typing it and what comments i expect. i just don't know.

i have attachment issues so i developed feelings for her despite only talking to her for three days and made the mistake of telling my friends and asking if she liked me and she said she doesn’t know
but now she doesn’t even like me anymore i think because she doesn’t text me anymore at all bro ever since she found out i told people we were talking 

she was perfect bro

i hate myself 

i am giving her space though

but i digress, i’m just tired of the constant shift in my personality

im tired of looking at my face in the mirror constantly

i hate myself even when i’m happy i still know deep down that i hate myself

hence why i rely on others for love

im a loser compared to other people i haven’t accomplished something big in my life ever

i take pictures of myself thinking i’m so hot and then i look at them in my camera roll and delete them as fast as possible before i can see how hideous i am

Question: Share (often) inappropriately intense emotions when they come up with people or work on distress tolerance/seeing things more rationally alone?,"i never seem to be able to answer this one… i have discouraged bpd and today a conversation between my partner and i really triggered feelings of inadequacy. i know it’s not that logical so should i just try to mend it alone? i feel hurt but i’m not even sure if it’s just about what’s been said.

Not recognising yourself in the mirror?,"i did not realise it was not normal to not recognise your own reflection.
it's not that i think it is someone else, its just that the face in the mirror does not mean anything to me. i am constantly mildly dissociated so this must be underlying it, as well as a lack of identity, and feeling like i don't exist. 

i also have this mildly with other people, even those close to me, when i cannot work them out, and they don't have fixed characters in my head, there is no continuity with how i see them, so their faces don't really 'mean' one thing to me, as they don't have a fixed identity in my eyes either.

I think my partner has Bipolar and BPD,"my partner was diagnosed with bpd several years ago. they have been in therapy for years doing dbt and taking an antidepressant for depression and medical marijuana for anxiety.

in love with my older married monogamous friend.,"i’ve had bpd symptoms my whole life &amp; was immediately diagnosed once i began pursuing mental health care less than a week after my 18th birthday. i’m 22 now &amp; have been rediagnosed(?) about a million times. thankfully my symptoms have improved a lot through therapy, a better support network, psychedelics &amp; general healing.. but i find myself becoming obsessed with people quite easily, mirroring their personalities subconsciously without even wanting to, fearing abandonment constantly, etc. a few years back i met a wonderful couple, both of these people are incredible &amp; i hope to be able to call them some of my best friends for the rest of my life. but soon after spending more time with them, i realized i was insanely attracted to the husband. over time i fell in love with him &amp; it’s gotten to the point where in the past year or so i really can’t get him off my mind. i just want to learn everything about him &amp; spend as much time with him as possible.. he’s definitely become my fp (my spouse (we are polyamorous) is also my fp but i’m madly in love with both of them).

about ten months ago my spouse &amp; i moved about four hours away &amp; i haven’t been able to really spend much time with this couple, maybe once every couple of months. we all used to hang out like one or two times a week sometimes, so it’s a big difference. it seems like they’re pulling away but i have no idea if i’m just imagining that. my spouse &amp; i are not well off whatsoever but we try to save back as much as we can to go visit them &amp; some of my family in the same town every month or two, or just whenever we are able. when we’re in town, they seem a bit more distant &amp; our interactions sometimes seem forced. to be fair, these people are pretty busy as they each have tons of friends &amp; family, work lives, etc. i’ve tried really hard to keep my attraction to the husband a secret from the couple because obviously i don’t want to ruin our friendship &amp; they are monogamous &amp; have been married for 15 years, so i can’t imagine i’ve done anything that would make it blatantly obvious that i’m into him. we have all always had good conversations &amp; visits &amp; i have searched every corner of my brain trying to figure out why they may have pulled away. my spouse who doesn’t have bpd has even brought it up, so it makes me wonder if we’re both just insecure or if we are indeed reading the situation properly. either way, it feels like my heart shatters every time i think about it, &amp; when we moved i cried nonstop (even though i almost never cry). this family has reiterated many times that my spouse &amp; i are like family to them &amp; we all became so close, but i’m so terrified they’re going to leave. abandonment is one of my greatest fears &amp; i don’t want to do anything to push them away.

A changed friendship is worse than an ended one,"exactly what it says. it hurts much worse to feel unloved and like i'm not this person's ""best friend"" anymore than it does if she would just end it with me. sometimes i wish she would. i feel like a fair-weather friend and it's physically painful.

Is it normal to feel nothing for your FP?,"every therapist i've seen lately has been nothing but an exercise in incompetence, so i figure i'll ask the peanut gallery. 

my girlfriend is my favorite person, and i've managed to lower to pedestal she stands on to mere centimetres.  both she and my esa cat are the two things keeping me from sweet sweet release. 

but i don't feel any real positive emotion for either of them. i feel all the fun negative emotions, (mild) jealousy when i get no attention, miss them both terribly when they're not around. and when the bad feelings stop, it's like a drug being without the pain. 

when i actually try to let my walls down, it's like some jerk is shoving a chainsaw into my chest and it's set on 'frappe'.  i figured, eventually there'll be an end to the tears and i can start feeling positive feelings for them.  

well i'm still waiting. i do all the nice things one should do to make your girl happy, but i can't actually share in any of it. as long as she's happy, everything will be all right. seeing her cry utterly destroys me and i go into full on momma bear mode. the thought of not being home in time to give my kitty her daily gooshy food will (and just did) send me into tearful conniption fits.

but, on the best days? utter numbness.

scared to date someone because i’m afraid i’ll hurt them because of my unstable tendencies,"broke up with my ex about 5 months ago and i’m finally out and casually dating people again as i’m finally over him but still caring about him a lot. 

today i was going through my spotify and i found that he was making playlists about heavy drug use and just how he’s not doing well and i feel extreme guilt. ive also seen him out late at night around town (normally during my breakdowns) and he’s always high, we wave but don’t talk.

we broke up because of how my unstable and manipulative tendencies were affecting us both. at the end of our relationship he started getting into drugs and told me it was his way of coping with the stress i was causing him. 


he was also manipulative in the relationship and i recognise that he has chosen to cope in this way, i in no way condoned his coping methods. but surely it’s no coincidence that each time i break up with sober guys they end up going to drugs, i feel so guilty.

Shame at spiraling,"i recently went through a big friendship break-up and i am having a hard time dealing with the heart break. i feel so stuck in the past and i wish i could return to the way things were. but what hurts even more is the guilt and shame i feel about the way i behaved. it's difficult to go into the details of what happened without writing a novel bit everything was so complicated. what happened first was that my best friend led me on romantically; she told me that she had feelings for me for many years and that she wanted to be in a relationship with me. we were romantically involved for about a month, but it wasn't a relationship. she told me she wanted to wait until she got her ocd under control. then her ex showed back up in her life and two days after we had sex (it was my first time) she went back to her ex, without telling me she was no longer interested in me and wanted to go back to him. i was extremely hurt but i was compassionate, she has bpd also and i understand how we split on people often. anyway our friendship became very tense as she distanced herself from me to be with him. a lot more events happened later on but basically she did and said some things that targeted some paranoias and anxieties i have due to ptsd. i became very angry and reactive and began to spiral out of control. the way i reacted was really embarrassing and shameful. i tried to apologize many times, but i can't do anything else now as she doesn't want me in her life anymore and her boyfriend told her she is no longer allowed to speak to me. it's so hard for me to forgive myself for my many outbursts and the way i treated her, when i am not being allowed to make amends. i just feel very embarrassed. part of me believes that if i had been less reactive, we would still be friends. but at the same time, i know that our friendship was damaged as soon as she led me on and abandoned our friendship for her ex. it's all been difficult for me to process. i wish i had better emotional skills to handle this. i'm trying to practice radical acceptance and accept that i behaved badly and i no longer have her in my life, but all of it so painful.",1642879106,False,BPD,2022-01-22 19:18:26,1,0,0,"Shame at spiraling i recently went through a big friendship break-up and i am having a hard time dealing with the heart break. i feel so stuck in the past and i wish i could return to the way things were. but what hurts even more is the guilt and shame i feel about the way i behaved. it's difficult to go into the details of what happened without writing a novel bit everything was so complicated. what happened first was that my best friend led me on romantically;

"My second time going to my psychiatrist, a bit of a progress update I guess… 🤷","i saw my psychiatrist yesterday and told her about my experience with the prescribed emotional stabilizers. this was my first month of taking them.

my mother was requested to come with me to the consultation since this was my second time seeing her and i guess she also needed to hear about my situation. the psychiatrist told her that i fall under the criteria for bpd and that i have a “personality disorder” but that she isn’t willing to give me an on paper diagnosis since i’m too young (f20) and i suppose because of the stigma. her reasoning behind it is that i have great potential to overcome this disorder since i’m very motivated and consistent/strict with my actions. 

i quote “you will eventually be able to learn how to live with it”. 

i guess this is good news guys? 

however, she said that i’ll have to take the medication for a year, minimum. that kinda bummed me out… and the fact that she upped my dosage…

Feeling misdiagnosed,"i don’t think it’s a hard diagnosis on paper yet, but a mental health professional i saw earlier this week for trauma has told me that they strongly believe i have bpd. i only spoke with them for about 20 minutes about my mental health issues, all over the phone. they are a professional who has the capacity to make a diagnosis. i feel like they decided to put me in that box before even speaking with me from looking at my chart’s history because my estranged father has bpd.

I can’t cope with the mood swings,"so one of my worst symptoms is mood swings. before my diagnosis i thought it was normal for people to feel they way i was feeling and now i have the diagnosis it makes a lot more sense and i find a lot of comfort in that. 
however im getting to a point where i’m really struggling with the mood swings. two days last week i decided to track all my moods in those days and it literally changed every half an hour almost on the exact minute (weird) and as we all know it can go from perfectly fine/happy to devastating depression/emptiness/etc. 

since tracking my moods i’ve been hyper aware of the shifts and as much as it’s good to be self aware i’m so exhausted and i have no idea how to actually cope with these swings in healthy way.

My boyfriend and his bestie!!,"ok so i'll go straight to the point. i was feeling really shit these last weeks and i always went to my boyfriend for support, until he was feeling bad mentally and needed his space, which i respect. the thing is, he almost didn't talk to me, and that's completely fine because he needs space when he feels low, but i saw on instagram that his best friend was going to his house. i had a fucking panick attack because i was already feeling extremely paranoid that he was talking with everyone but me, that he needed distance but only from me. that was like a confirmation and i panicked. i told him i was feeling horrible and wanted to talk about it because relationships don't work without comunication, and he told me the truth of his situation and that he wasn't talking behind my back, that day he was feeling better and they talked to him because they needed to do their homework in his pc. i calmed down and tried to rationalize, the extreme physical pain i was feeling because of my intense emotions vanished and felt much better.
later that night i woke up at 6am and saw that his bestie uploaded an instagram story. she was sitting on top of him, they weren't cuddling or anything but still, it's kinda weird and felt bad about it but tried to no think about it and sleep for a little bit more. i had a nightmare about him liking them more than me (won't go into details it's long af), and now, the next day i told him about my nightmare and my jealousy and he said he will be more careful and not upload that kinda things. completely fine i guess but in which world you decide just after hearing your partner having a breakdown and talking about their jealousy, that you're gonna upload a weird story about just what bothers me? i always try to make him comfortable and be better for him but, does he even care? i told him many times that his friend makes me jealous, but ehy would yo keep posting weird shit online, even knowing it will probably bother me? 
i don't want him to stop hanging out with them, i don't want to be a toxic person, what else can i do? i think anyone without bpd would feel like shit if this happened to them, it's not my fault really. i found it really disrespectful, it's like they are the couple and i'm his friend, i don't know what to tell him anymore without sounding controlling or toxic or manipulative or shitty.",1642860061,False,BPD,2022-01-22 14:01:01,1,0,0,"My boyfriend and his bestie!! ok so i'll go straight to the point. i was feeling really shit these last weeks and i always went to my boyfriend for support, until he was feeling bad mentally and needed his space, which i respect. the thing is, he almost didn't talk to me, and that's completely fine because he needs space when he feels low, but i saw on instagram that his best friend was going to his house. i had a fucking panick attack because i was already feeling extremely paranoid that he was talking with everyone but me, that he needed distance but only from me. that was like a confirmation and i panicked. i told him i was feeling horrible and wanted to talk about it because relationships don't work without comunication, and he told me the truth of his situation and that he wasn't talking behind my back, that day he was feeling better and they talked to him because they needed to do their homework in his pc. i calmed down and tried to rationalize, the extreme physical pain i was feeling because of my intense emotions vanished and felt much better.

I’m in love with my boyfriend’s best friend,"so i know this is bad, and i feel like shit for it so go easy on me please.

however i’ve met his friends and we’ve been hanging out a lot, twice a week for 12 hrs in person, and from 8pm-3am in video calls. and there’s one of them that’s been discreetly hitting on me, and i really like him too. however i don’t know if i still love my boyfriend (haven’t known for about 6 months, i have a bunch of mood disorders that make feelings hard), and i don’t want to be the asshole who breaks up with my boyfriend and shows up to every hang out with his friend.

I’m finding myself in another BPD relationship after the first person destroyed me,"so, back in 2020 i broke up with someone who was later diagnosed with bpd. they had cheated on me multiple times with their friends and had really brutalized me because of their self hatred and self destructive habits. they used me as a pawn in their self harm game. i told myself that this would never happen again. fast forward to now and i’m now in love and in a 7 month relationship with another woman who i’ve realized has bpd. and it’s starting to get bad.

my new gf was able to control herself for a few months before getting bad. she breaks up with me at least once a week and will remove her pictures of us on her social media. and she will block me from her stories and post who knows what. i just think it’s really toxic and i thought she was being malicious and manipulative. it’s so embarrassing to me because i pick her up from work and her coworkers are probably seeing all of this happen. she has security at her job and i’m sure they’re happy to see her remove pictures of her boyfriend and post hot selfies of herself when she’s splitting ….

it turns out that she actually seems to have bpd. she will split on me and say crazy things like she wants nothing to do with me . this weekend she is currently splitting on me because she’s being ‘selfish’ and wants me all to herself but i had promised my mom i would drive her to an airbnb. my mom has always wanted for us to get her an airbnb by the beach and she’s i’ll now so this is important to me so i put my foot down and told her that this is important. she blocked me. and then she unblocked me and i made plans with some friends because she’s literally stressing me out and ignoring me. i’m trying to convince myself that it isn’t intentional but it’s so hard. 

on one hand i truly love her and respect her condition. it’s totally not her fault that she’s having these intrusive thoughts. she thinks i will abandon her. but i don’t know maybe i just need therapy. i’m so scared that she’s thinking of other men when she splits. i’ve stalked her instagram and see she likes pictures of other men . i feel like i can accept her mental illness but also my insecurities are creeping up. when she tells me she doesn’t want me anymore, i can’t help think why she’s liking her followers selfies. she says she wants to swell nudes when she’s low on money. it’s stressing me out, she swears that she just gets triggered and loses control. i think i do believe her and i love her so much. i guess i’m just looking for perspective, thanks guys.",1642824083,False,BPD,2022-01-22 04:01:23,0,0,0,"I’m finding myself in another BPD relationship after the first person destroyed me so, back in 2020 i broke up with someone who was later diagnosed with bpd. they had cheated on me multiple times with their friends and had really brutalized me because of their self hatred and self destructive habits. they used me as a pawn in their self harm game. i told myself that this would never happen again. fast forward to now and i’m now in love and in a 7 month relationship with another woman who i’ve realized has bpd. and it’s starting to get bad.

Had a bad day at work and spiralled,"... kept making mistakes and couldn't absorb instructions cause i felt like there was a fog rolling in over my senses. i'm doing my internship rn as per my module guide to graduate. the senior i was assisting just abruptly, hastily and hurriedly explained everything in under 5 and expected me to know everything and then was lowkey pissed and acted v condescendingly towards me when i inevitably make mistakes.

  i have another 13 weeks and i don't know how long i can go on. it's either i continue and finish the employment or defer my final semester. i was trying my best not to cry after lunch yesterday but tears kept welling up in my eyes. i wanted to quit and defer the semester and at the same time i'm already so close to the finish line. 

  i don't wanna defer again, i wanna graduate and get my degree. i really miss my bf (ldr and talk everyday) and my friends, whom are bz rn and have a healthy relationship w me but i just can't with work. i find people and colleagues v difficult to navigate. i was trying my absolute best to just suck it up and not do or say anything rash.  

  went back home and bawled my eyes out to my bf and journalled like crazy, and am dreading the next monday already.  


  someone here once mentioned that the best scenario for peeps like us is to work and study from home and i could not agree more....

i was diagnosed with bpd a few months ago when i started therapy. recently i've been feeling really awful, i'm at a point in my life where i can't take it anymore, i hate my life, i don't see the point in anything and i'm really tired of every symptom of bpd, especially the mood swings. for a couple of days i couldn't stop crying if i didn't listen to my comfort song or watch something (like, the second the end credits would come on screen or for the few seconds if took for the song to restart i'd start bawling my eyes out again). i told all these and some more things to my therapist and she thinks that i should see a psychiatrist to start medicine 


i have two concerns about that. i want to talk about them with my therapist but our next appointment is in almost a week and i keep thinking about it, and i don't think my friends would understand or give good advice. 


first, because i've been invalidated by others and myself &amp; have been ignoring everything wrong with me for almost all my life, i don't believe i'm in ""bad enough"" condition to take meds, i feel like i should be able to cope another way even though the logical part of me knows that i can't function. 


the second one is that i'm insulin resistant and i've been trying to lose weight for 6 months. i've lost a lot of weight, and i'm so scared that i'll take it back because of the meds and i'll get back to where i was (or in worse condition), and everything i did would be for nothing. i'm having periods of binge eating and periods of starving myself, but they've stopped a lot since i went on a diet to control my insulin resistance and lose weight, and i'm afraid they'll become like they were before. i've also seen some other side effects that scare me but not as much as gaining weight

"It's so hard to do anything with the gaping, unending emptiness all around you.","the emptiness comes and goes in waves, but has been persistent for the last few months. a lovingly crafted combination of the throwing away of a friendship that gave me hope and fulfillment, the dental pain that never seems to go away no matter how much debt i go into at the dentist, and finally, a bodily injury that's led to me being out of work for the past week and probably 3 more.

without work, as much as i hated it, i wake up way later than i used to. i used to wake up at 5 am. the days felt longer, i felt like i got more out of the time i have with earth. but since being out of work, and being alone, it's incredibly hard to wake up before 9:30/10a.m. coupled with the dental pain that keeps me up, sporadically, at night, and the injury incurred with work, my sleep quality has nose dived. putting me into a daily dissociative fog.

i'm finding it hard to do anything. cook. clean. breathe. i'm a 30 year old dude, 3 years into working retail in this pandemic. the burnout is so real i'm starting to smell cooked skin. everything feels so pointless, because i don't have hope anymore.

i used to have hope. a small hope. but the world is so different now. for work? i've tried applying for better, non-retail jobs (i have a degree, but psych) for years, to no avail. even with a stint interning in hr, nothing panned out. i used connections with friends to find some opportunities, and always failed the interview.

for a relationship? this is the one that hurts the most. i can barely write about it because i can feel the water rising in my chest, about to choke me. the world just isn't the same anymore. it doesn't work like it did when i used to successfully date. i tried online dating, and it's not the medium for me. if refusing to adapt and use online dating means being alone for the rest of my time, i'll make peace with that.

at this rate, i don't even have the motivation or energy to even *think* about ending my own life. i just know that when that moment comes, i'll be okay. because i lived, i experienced the things that mattered to me most even if they were brief, i'd rather accept it and quietly end my story, then to try to cling to life hoping that one day, maybe one day, i'll experience human connection again.",1642801801,False,BPD,2022-01-21 21:50:01,1,0,0,"It's so hard to do anything with the gaping, unending emptiness all around you. the emptiness comes and goes in waves, but has been persistent for the last few months. a lovingly crafted combination of the throwing away of a friendship that gave me hope and fulfillment, the dental pain that never seems to go away no matter how much debt i go into at the dentist, and finally, a bodily injury that's led to me being out of work for the past week and probably 3 more.

What to do with unexpressed affection?,"hey all, i don't know if this is a common problem amongst people with bpd but here goes anyway. basically i have a really serious crush at the moment. we went on a date, i thought it went well but he didn't want another. we are on good terms though - good thing too as we have to see each other every day - and one thing that's worth mentioning is that he is extremely affectionate with everyone, myself included. while it's nice that he is affectionate with me, on an emotional level it is probably kind of confusing as it can make it feel like he's reciprocating when he's not. like, when we say goodbye he full on kisses me on the cheek and lets me do the same to him. he's doing it because he's like that; i'm doing it because it's him and i'm practically in love with the guy.

i haven't seen him in two weeks - different to the usual 5 hours every weekday - because he's had a bereavement and has been away because of that. so as a result of not seeing him and also feeling sad for him and worried about him, i really really really want to give him the most enormous hug ever.

My FP just makes me feel so much worse than I already am,"i made the terrible mistake of getting on a housing contract to live with him for a year. i’ve got about 7 months left of this. because of course i persuaded him to move with me because at university i cannot cope with living alone (or with strangers) so yeah i’m stuck with him. 

it’s just heartbreaking. he snaps at me for everything. but when i get angry of course i’m the worst because i have bpd and he just contributes to my anger instead of doing the reasonable thing and making me calm down at least try!!!!

i really can’t wait until i don’t live with him anymore because even though he says “i love you” and i reply “i love you too” i don’t really mean it because of all the horrible ways he acted with me. his argument is always “well you attack me a million times worse through personal, critical insults”  which is true but he hurts me and he doesn’t even realise, unlike me i’m self aware after the shouting and arguing stops. 

the sad thing is i have no friends apart from people i talk to online and i don’t even consider that to be real.

So tired of dealing with my battles,"long story short - my 6 years bf broke up with me on october 2020 because he couldn't handle my intense emotions and splitting (black/white. love/hate). back then, i wasn't diagnosed with bpd so none of us have a clear understanding of it.  i was diagnosed with bpd in the summer and did dbt therapy and it really helped me understanding bpd and the tools they taught us.

i was doing perfectly fine for 4 months until my ex reached out to me and wanted to meet up for coffee. we ended up sleeping together and i was under impressed that he wanted to get back with me because we slept together. he told me straight up after that it was a mistake and he does not want to get back with me because i caused him some trauma in the last six years. to be fair, i said some really nasty stuff to him in the past. he was scared that if we get back together, i might be that person again. so he said sorry and how we shouldn't have met up.

that made me go into depression/suicidal spiral and i ended up binge eating and drank crazy amount of alcohol, deleted all of my social media accounts and turned off my phone for 2 days straight. my parents were worried about me and passed by my apartment to check up on me and my mom stayed over night because she thinks i'll attempt again. i'm just so tired of being like this. i wish i'm like others who dont have bpd. it sucks :(",1642785213,False,BPD,2022-01-21 17:13:33,1,0,0,"So tired of dealing with my battles long story short - my 6 years bf broke up with me on october 2020 because he couldn't handle my intense emotions and splitting (black/white. love/hate). back then, i wasn't diagnosed with bpd so none of us have a clear understanding of it.  i was diagnosed with bpd in the summer and did dbt therapy and it really helped me understanding bpd and the tools they taught us.

i’ve been having a rough couple of days but something someone said to me made me feel really proud of myself,"i’m a mental health counselor (lol ik) but i’ve been in dbt and tbh my therapist has really helped me and i’m also in recovery. she also gives me tips to manage my emotions in relation to not taking on my patients emotions and pain or feeling triggered. i’ve been doing really well so far. 

i work with kids and today was my last session with my first patient since i started working at my job. i asked her how she was feeling and she said “i’ve noticed that ever since you came around i’ve been much happier” and i almost cried. her mom also thanked me and told me she’s been doing so much better. i just spoke to her mom and she thanked me again and said her daughter’s been much happier. she surprised me with a plant for christmas because i mentioned it once during a session we had. and i almost cried then too.  

i feel like i found my purpose in life. i mean, i have other purposes, but in terms of my career i legitimately love what i do and i’m so passionate about it.  i always knew i wanted to be a therapist or to help other people in general. but i doubted myself because of my mental illness and trauma and though maybe i couldn’t. but even my therapist revealed that she sees a therapist and will sometimes let me know she went through similar things. 

i am capable. i am so close to the future i want. i feel really proud of myself and happy that i could help her :( she truly is so resilient and a great kid with a bright future. and i wish my program was longer so we didn’t have to move on only after 6 weeks.

Just got 'dumped' by my reddit friend (who also has bpd),"last year before i finally went to therapy, i asked my local reddit community about this particular therapy place that i was interested in going. 

my reddit friend entered my chats and long story short we both not only have bpd but we also go to the same therapy place (our sesh are usually scheduled on the same day too) and we both have the same fav spot. 

i was very grateful for her. words of affirmation is not my love language. i do not trust people and their words. so anything anyone says, its full of shit to me. i dont know how but.... she managed to get to me with her words. i genuinely believed her. trusted her. 

last year (just last month), i had plans to off myself and i genuinely was about to go through with them. she knew how serious my plans were so she proposed we met up at least once. and we did. im grateful that we did. she was a nice and funny person and we vibed well irl. 

a couple days after our meetup i was supposed to do it. but things started to happen which got me distracted and made me postpone my plans. im in january now and im struggling so much to stay afloat. its not even the end of the month and i have had experience incredible highs and also very shitty lows. 

i have bought an extremely expensive camera. i got scammed for almost $400. i have recently sourced out for dr*gs and im extremely dependant on my dr*gs/meds. i have started to develop a substance ab*se issue and went down this wormhole of all things related to dr*gs which made me distant and cold. this made me 'accidentally' ignored/forgotten to reply to her msgs. 

today i received this text from her: 

""hey man, i just wanted to message you before i do this: i need to delete my account again and just disappear. i did this a couple of months back as well, and i genuinely thought you wouldn’t notice or care. you were the trigger for the deletion. i’m sorry i didn’t tell you this then, i couldn’t tell you, it felt like i was “too emotional” or “too sensitive”. i do apologise that it triggered your abandonment stuff back then and i apologise if it does that again. 

let me explain why i have to delete and just leave. i think the reality is that i am too sensitive. i am a bpd patient, i am extremely sensitive to rejection. i do get affected when i feel like others simply don’t care and unfortunately, that’s how i felt with you. it would trigger me when you wouldn’t reply to my messages. i tried to be okay with it, i would tell you it’s fine to not reply because i didn’t want to pressure you into replying. 

i get it. sometimes, i can’t reply to messages with my friends either and i always feel pressured and guilty. i didn’t want you to feel that way. however, while i struggle with replying to messages, i do get very triggered when people don’t reply to my messages. it’s similar to the thing with your ex when she’d be late, you’d be upset; but when you were late, she’d patiently wait. this is one reason why i tend to stay away from people like myself, because we can end up triggering each other. it also felt like i didn’t matter in any way to you. 

i felt like you saw my value not in the friendship but in … just having an objective opinion, if that makes sense. that’s not to say you weren’t helpful to me, because believe me, you really, really were. when i needed help, you were always there. but, it’s difficult to explain what i mean when i say that i still felt unwanted. i think i valued you in some way. and it didn’t feel mutual. 

you have your greek friend and you value her. i can see that you truly care about her. 

so this is all just stuff that ended up triggering for me and made me leave the first time as well. even now, i wouldn’t be able to tell you this if not for the fact that i’m deleting my acc. i’m not confrontational or open about my emotions, those things are difficult for me. but i don’t want to just disappear without giving you a reason. 

i hope you don’t feel abandoned. my mind is telling me that you won’t care. but just in case it does trigger stuff — i am sorry. but, my mind is also telling me, you do have people in your life. you have your greek friend, you have your scorpio friend, you have (insert my psychs name here). and maybe other people you value too. those are your friends. i am not sure what i ever was. maybe it’s just my own issues with feeling unwanted, i don’t know. 

anyway, please take care. i hope you’ll go for therapy, it’ll help, i promise it will help. and don’t give up. sometimes looking too far into the future is not a good idea, sometimes it’s just better to take one step at a time. i believe you’ll be okay and you’ll get the future you want. you’ll be a mother, a wife, you’ll have your own cats and kids. just don’t give up. bye bye, it was nice to know you. honestly."" 

it hurts a lot. i dont blame her for doing what she did. she has bpd too. but it hurts to know that her last thought of me would be how i dont care enough for her or value her as a person. i never thought i would make friends thru reddit but i have successfully made some friends here. out of every friend ive made, shes my fav friend. she was the reddit friend i trusted the most. i dont have any other way of contacting her. the only means of contact i have with her is via reddit. shes extremely paranoid and secretive, hence why she never told me her name, where she stayed, her socials or phone number. i respected that and never pushed her to give me more details. she reminds me a lot of one of my close friends irl. theyre both very paranoid and are full of anxiety.... honestly i dont know where im going with this. im just upset. frustrated. hurt.

I might have to work full time and I’m not sure if I’m mentally ready,"i’ve started working since i was 2019-2020 part time while studying. i don’t know how i managed but anyways after that job corona hit and it was hard to find a job. as i was studying at the time i didn’t care to look for jobs as urgently.

I still dream of my ex I was traumabonded to,"i’m typing this as i’m laying next to my boyfriend while he’s asleep.

for months now i have postponed every discussion about a diagnosis with my therapist, we are both aware  of my depression and anxiety but we were exploring the possibility of a personality disorder for quite sometime now, we also discussed bipolar disorder. the reason about postponing any talk about that is because i felt that an additional diagnosis would cause me more harm than good. i really think i have bpd i check almost every box and when reading information i feel like someone is describing me. i believe my therapist clearly knows what disorder i have.

BPD ruined what could’ve been the one relationship I always longed for,"my boyfriend of almost two years broke up with me today, and i can still remember the day i first met him. he was the chaser and i was just looking for a friend. he considered me the one girl he was always looking for.

all this while my boyfriend, now ex, was losing feelings for me. and i’m not stupid, i knew what the consequences of my actions would hold for me, but i could never, ever, control my reactions to situations. i gave it my 100 percent, that i’m sure, but it could not undo the damage.

i am 20, almost 21 now and i still can't consider myself as an adult. i try and i try and i try to do everything right but it seems like i'm failing

everything that comes out of my mouth seems either way too rude, naïve or cringe and everyone seems to judge me for whatever i'm saying or do, especially here on reddit.

i don't know if i'm making everything worse than it already is and i definitely know that there are a lot of people who just love running their mouth about everythink. maybe i'm focusing on the negatives way too much, but it fucks up with my brain way too much, to the point i just want to stay in bed and listen to music. and at the same time keep up with school, my parent's expectations, because i obviously have responsabilities, and also trying to still talk to my friends.

i've been bullied quite badly in the past, to the point of getting hit and breaking down crying in the middle of class and being considered an outsider even in highschool (i was literally kicked out of the class groupchat) 

i try talking to my friends, but they always seem to think it's just another episode or another outbreak. for once i just wish someone could listen to me and take me seriously when i say i feel like shit.

i tried finding solace in music, especially kpop lately, more specifically, k-r&amp;b, a little k-rap and k-rock, trying to know myself more through zodiac, mbti and other personality tests, but i still feel empty. i tried filling this void with so much and nothing works.

retail therapy would probably make things 10000x times worse since i am a bigger woman and i would break down trying to find clothes that fit

i tried going to therapy but i was scheduled quite rarely and it didn't really do shit (although i tried) but she basically told me that i am exaggerating and that i should give people another chance (completely disregarding my obvious trust issues and my avoidant attachment style, if you're familiar with it). i opened up to her, my therapist knowing damn well i have bpd (which i had to realise myself, since my paper didn't clearly state borderline, it said emotionally unstable personality structure, which i later found out it was another way to say bpd)

speaking of trust issues, i barely had a one month relationship. i am always the one who flees the moment something seems wrong, especially if someone points it out. i could see myself getting way too attached, but to be fair, i barely had some minor crushes that i would forget the moment i don't see them. so nothing to really suffer over, even if i kinda get attached. i am scared of commitment, not gonna lie, and always feeling like i'm falling behind, since i'm kind of a late bloomer. 

i just...keep fucking up and i'm sick of it. i'm so sick of myself that i can't even look in the mirror without wanting to break it to pieces.

i feel like i'm saying too much now, but i really needed to get some things and i thought you guys would understand.

2. i want to reach out more and become more social. the pandemic has made us all forget how to be social and i've become comfortable isolating. my plan is to take in-person classes and join the creative writing club.
3. i would like to begin an exercise routine slowly and safely. not to lose weight, but to be overall healthy. my test results said i'm at risk for heart disease/heart attack and i'm 26, so i either nip it in the bud now or risk it. i realized we only get one body, temporarily. i want to treat myself better.

seeking help for not meeting expectations and procrastination,"i need help with my shame-procrastination problem.

whenever i have to admit that i haven’t met expectations in one way or another, i become filled with overwhelming panic, especially when i fail to meet expectations because i procrastinated. 

this is especially problematic when i have professional obligations, such as when i don’t get any work done during the day (usually due to my procrastination) and have to change a deadline. usually, i lie about how much i get done and when. this has lead to enormous problems, such as lying for days on end and then having to admit that i need an extension. this pattern has put my employment in jeopardy. 

clearly, my issue is of avoidance. i don’t take responsibility for my actions and choose to hide them and hope panic-working for 24 hours in a row will get the project done. sometimes it does. most of the time, it leads to me turning things in an hour late, which is a problem. 

i know i am messing up when i’m procrastinating. when i am procrastinating, i don’t sleep. this has extended to multiple day-long stretches where i am hallucinating, but i still refuse to sleep because “i have not gotten my work done.” but, i will still avoid my work, by being on my phone/internet, random chores, staring at walls, etc. while kicking myself. encouragement doesn’t work either - thinking anything like “you can do it” or “just do 1 hour” or “you still have time” are ineffective.

when i try to work when i am procrastinating, i drag my feet, and work very slowly. or, i experience this deep mental pain that feels like i’m bending my arm the wrong direction in my head. even when i eliminate my distractions or am under pressure (turn my computer off, phone in phone jail, everything’s clean, books away, it’s due tomorrow) i will still. just. sit there. terrified, maybe disassociated, ashamed. 

i am just persistently, not, getting things done. and feeling bad about it. and then still. not. working. several therapists, friends, and partners have said i am “not even trying.” i become *very* upset at that and i apologize for not trying. “your apologies mean nothing. you will just do this again.” they are right, and i feel horrible. you’d think i would get my shit done to solve the problem - but no. i hate myself for that the most.

i am just persistently, not, getting things done. and feeling bad about it. and then still. not. working. several therapists, friends, and partners have said i am “not even trying.” i become *very* upset at that and i apologize for not trying. “your apologies mean nothing. you will just do this again.” they are right, and i feel horrible. you’d think i would get my shit done to solve the problem - but no. i hate myself for that the most.

as a bit of a backstory, i was always considered a more unusual/weird kid. from anger outbursts (quite frequent, might i add) to daydreaming to anxiety to depression later in life. i most probabaly had/have adhd too but i don't want to self diagnose so i'll keep it as a probability.

i am 20, almost 21 now and i still can't consider myself as an adult. i try and i try and i try to do everything right but it seems like i'm failing

everything that comes out of my mouth seems either way too rude, naïve or cringe and everyone seems to judge me for whatever i'm saying or do, especially here on reddit.

i don't know if i'm making everything worse than it already is and i definitely know that there are a lot of people who just love running their mouth about everythink. maybe i'm focusing on the negatives way too much, but it fucks up with my brain way too much, to the point i just want to stay in bed and listen to music. and at the same time keep up with school, my parent's expectations, because i obviously have responsabilities, and also trying to still talk to my friends.

i've been bullied quite badly in the past, to the point of getting hit and breaking down crying in the middle of class and being considered an outsider even in highschool (i was literally kicked out of the class groupchat) 

i try talking to my friends, but they always seem to think it's just another episode or another outbreak. for once i just wish someone could listen to me and take me seriously when i say i feel like shit.

i tried finding solace in music, especially kpop lately, more specifically, k-r&amp;b, a little k-rap and k-rock, trying to know myself more through zodiac, mbti and other personality tests, but i still feel empty. i tried filling this void with so much and nothing works.

retail therapy would probably make things 10000x times worse since i am a bigger woman and i would break down trying to find clothes that fit

i tried going to therapy but i was scheduled quite rarely and it didn't really do shit (although i tried) but she basically told me that i am exaggerating and that i should give people another chance (completely disregarding my obvious trust issues and my avoidant attachment style, if you're familiar with it). i opened up to her, my therapist knowing damn well i have bpd (which i had to realise myself, since my paper didn't clearly state borderline, it said emotionally unstable personality structure, which i later found out it was another way to say bpd)

speaking of trust issues, i barely had a one month relationship. i am always the one who flees the moment something seems wrong, especially if someone points it out. i could see myself getting way too attached, but to be fair, i barely had some minor crushes that i would forget the moment i don't see them. so nothing to really suffer over, even if i kinda get attached. i am scared of commitment, not gonna lie, and always feeling like i'm falling behind, since i'm kind of a late bloomer. 

i just...keep fucking up and i'm sick of it. i'm so sick of myself that i can't even look in the mirror without wanting to break it to pieces.

Fight with boyfriend,"after sex today my boyfriend started getting upset at me because his chronic hip injury started to bother him again. he said ‘i told you not to ask me for sex’ which he never did say, but i did ask him (he agreed to do it). we started fighting and he got right up in my face screaming at me, this caused me to push him away. he then started yelling saying i hurt his hip again from pushing him, because of his response i started to cry , thinking i hurt him. he started threatening to leave my house which sent me in a panic (abandonment anxiety). i stood there pulling him back by his shirt and begging him to stay.. i have not been able to calm myself down since , i feel like such a terrible person for hurting him, but everytime i bring it up he tells me to shut up about it and that it doesn’t matter. this also makes me feel like i’m making myself the victim of something i started/ did. i don’t know how to go about this conversation with him :/",1641550240,False,BPD,2022-01-07 10:10:40,1,0,0,"Fight with boyfriend after sex today my boyfriend started getting upset at me because his chronic hip injury started to bother him again. he said ‘i told you not to ask me for sex’ which he never did say, but i did ask him (he agreed to do it). we started fighting and he got right up in my face screaming at me, this caused me to push him away. he then started yelling saying i hurt his hip again from pushing him, because of his response i started to cry , thinking i hurt him. he started threatening to leave my house which sent me in a panic (abandonment anxiety). i stood there pulling him back by his shirt and begging him to stay.. i have not been able to calm myself down since , i feel like such a terrible person for hurting him, but everytime i bring it up he tells me to shut up about it and that it doesn’t matter. this also makes me feel like i’m making myself the victim of something i started/ did. i don’t know how to go about this conversation with him :/","fight boyfriend sex today boyfriend started getting upset chronic hip injury started bother again. said ‘i told ask sex’ never say, ask (he agreed it). started fighting got right face screaming me, caused push away. started yelling saying hurt hip pushing him, response started cry , thinking hurt him. started threatening leave house sent panic (abandonment anxiety). stood pulling back shirt begging stay.. able calm since , feel like terrible person hurting him, everytime bring tell shut doesn’t matter. also make feel like i’m making victim something started/ did. don’t know go conversation :/"
Drama with my lifelong best friend... again,"i'm exhausted, angry, and sad.

my best friend and i met when we were both four.  we're both twenty-one now and have been best friends ever since.

unfortunately, the past few years or so have been a rollercoaster.

i made a new friend in 2018.  we were super close, and i eventually introduced him to my best friend.  they soon became friends.  unfortunately, in 2019, this new friend began consistently verbally abusing me, put me in risky situations, and sabotaged a hundreds of dollars weekend getaway that myself and my parents invested in.  i ended up ending this friendship.

my best friend remained friends with him and defended my former-new friend's actions to me, several times.  he said i exaggerated the story despite me having multiple witnesses that can claim otherwise.

in an effort to ""get back"" at me for a few drunken jokes i made in 2019 that i immediately apologized for the next morning, in 2020, when i wished my best friend a happy 20th birthday, he asked me how i was doing.  he knew for the past few weeks that i was just dumped by my girlfriend of half a year i was suicidal, barely eating, abusing cannabis and alcohol.  when i told him how poorly i was doing and how i didn't want to live anymore, he told me i deserved to feel that way and be alone the entire year as ""payback"" for the drunk jokes i made at a halloween party about a flirtationship he had, which again, i apologized profusely for and never did again.

i'm not sure why given that after he said these things to me it sent me into such a mental health crisis that i needed to contact an emergency therapist, but i ended up taking him back as a friend.

several months later, i reconnect with a former friend from long ago that my best friend also knows.  i introduce her to my best friend, and soon afrer i find out that my best friend was badmouthing and mocking me to this old/new friend of mine.  a month later, i find out both of them were smearing me with blatant lies and labeling my other friends with lies as well.  this old/new friend ended up hurting me deeply financially and insulted me horribly, so i ended that friendship with her.

once again, my best friend 1. remained friends with her and 2. defended her behavior to me.

in july 2021, my mom was driving to get coffee and saw 1. my best friend, 2. my former-new-friend from 2018/19 and 3. my former-old/new friend from the previous month all together hanging out at an intersection.  my mom was making a left turn and glanced at them, my best friend saw her, looked away, and my mom went to get coffee.  she told me when she got home what she saw.  i mentioned in-passing to my best friend about this, but told him that he can be friends with whoever he wants as long as they don't discuss anything about me while hanging out.

fast forward to today.  after a period of about 9 months of consistent, monthly fights instigated by my best friend, usually about something i said wrong (for example: he didn't like how i said ""what's up?"" when starting a phone call), my best friend accused my mom of ""harassing, stalking, and intimidating"" my best friend from the july 2021 day my mom glanced at the three of them hanging out.  enraged, i told my best friend that he has no right to accuse my mom of such a thing, and i told him how hurt i felt that he remained friends with two people who hurt me so badly in the past.  i asked him how would he like it if i was friends with his ex-flirtationship-person (his words) or some other person who wronged him.  he didn't answer.  i then told him that his ex is engaged, which is true (i admit i shouldn't have said this). i told him to stop making accusations and that i was tired of everything.

if you made it this far, i'm impressed.  it's 5am and i'm exhausted and stressed and sad.  i think i need a break from this ""best friend"" given that he's come up many times in therapy and i've realized that many times i don't have positive interactions with him anymore.

any advice would be helpful.

"Two of my best friends have BPD and there are things I accidentally do that are triggering for them, trying to be supportive but have boundaries. Advice?","hi. title basically explains it, two of my best friends have bpd and i accidentally trigger them. examples of what they’ve said:

•i don’t text enough or check in enough. i try to check in with friends once a week at least. i thought that was a reasonable amount. heck, if they call me, i’ll stay on the phone for an hour is i’m available! i just don’t have the mental energy to text literally anyone all day. my bf and i don’t even text really. both friends are very extroverted and i’m introverted

•they feel abandoned if we don’t talk for a few days.

Worried about long-term Dissociation,"i’ll try to sum this up quickly. i should mention in addition to bpd i am also diagnosed with bipolar, generalized anxiety and a lot of substance use disorders (sud)

i haven’t been off drugs consistently for a long time. mostly the last couple years though severe use of powder cocaine/adderall/benzos/painkillers/psychedelics/inhalants/dxm/marijuana/ecstasy and alcohol. the alcohol quite often being a fifth to myself on a daily basis. i have been off everything including marijuana for 5 months now.

the problem at hand is while i used to get dissociative rarely over a short period of time, i am now dissociative everyday for hours at a time and i am scared and feeling also as if people who are concerned for/love me will think i am on drugs/alcohol again. i did have a recent med change a couple months ago shortly after getting clean/sober. 

i’m just worried that the cause of all this is that my mental health is rapidly declining and i will soon be in long term care or group home environments. but then i think it might be meds (i have and will continue to talk to my doctor about that) also sometimes i tell myself if i were to get drunk or something that the uncomfortable dissociative feeling would go away but i don’t. could be from long term drug use (kinda) long term for me means starting at 14 and getting bad at 15. i am now 27 so i guess if we were to say 15, it’s been 12 years of pretty constant use. i feel so very dissociated and in a state of derealization often, though i am able to get through the day and am not in a psychotic episode/hallucinating or delusional. i could have done significant damage of course

It's been 3+ years and I'm still not over my ex. He's been in a new relationship but still updates the playlist he made for me and shades me on instagram.,"i just need to get this out, somewhere. it's been over 3 years and i'm still not over my ex. i haven't been in a relationship since. i go through periods where i do or don't think of him much, and right now it's one of the times i'm thinking of him more. i just can't help but feel like he's breadcrumbing me in a way? 

he made me a few playlists and they've all been updated ranging from 2019-mid 2021. the one updated most recently in 2021 was the first playlist that he made for me. 

then the instagram stuff. this is gonna sound fucked up, cause it is, but because of my past/trauma, at one point i accused him of being gay/bi. obviously this is wrong and i shouldn't have assumed his sexuality, much less accuse him of being a different sexuality than he presents. anyway. when he first got with his new gf, he made an ig post of them together mentioning being gay with his new gf. in his bio too he mentions he's gay for his gf. 

i feel like the mentioning being gay for a girl is a dig at me. like, maybe i'm reading too much into it, but... it was a large point of contempt towards the end of our relationship. 

it's just like.. ugh.. i thought maybe he was over me and hated me this whole time but the fact he still updates my playlist and (maybe) throws shade at me on instagram makes me think otherwise. i wish i could message him but i honestly want him to be happy and i don't want to interfere with his relationship if it's going well. 

i just don't know how to feel. i should really just let it go and stop obsessing but godddd it's fucking hard lol. 

i don't even remember the last time i saw him, i don't think. i blacked out most of the last few months of our relationship. technically i was the one to end things because i thought he didn't like me. i was so fucked in the head though. i look at notes i wrote from 2018 (when we dated) and i had very little empathy. i couldn't put myself in another person's shoes for shit and i know i didn't take his feelings into consideration much, despite trying. i just can't help but wonder if things would have been different if i could've managed to be chill and normal and not lash out at him all the time, which i did frequently.",1641523227,False,BPD,2022-01-07 02:40:27,1,0,0,"It's been 3+ years and I'm still not over my ex.

being in the same community as my ex/fp,"my fp recently broke up with me. ive been dealing with a lot of pain and anxiety over it, but that's exacerbated by the fact that we still exist in the same community. ive been trying to unattach myself from him as my fp (even though i dont really know how to do that) but im still very much attached to him and i know that because ive convinced myself that he hates me despite there being no evidence of that. that's basically how splitting manifests itself for me with my quiet bpd—i internalize all the rage and direct it at myself, and when he doesnt pay attention to me or communicate with me (which he hasnt been since we broke up) i just assume he probably hates me. as you can probably surmise its a really difficult situation being in the same community as him because literally everything he does i take as a sign of his dislike toward me. 

the problem is that the community we met through is a massive source of support and affirmation to both of us. the last thing i want to do is leave the community because some days it feels like it's just about the only thing keeping me afloat. but recently the pain it has been causing me has just been so overwhelming that ive been thinking about just leaving. 

i don't really know what to do here. do i stay and endure the pain of being in proximity to my ex/fp while that attachment to him is still intact and unfulfilled? or do i just leave that community and hope that i can find some relief from that pain even while i struggle with the loss of that support system? or is there some way i can communicate this all to him without overstepping the boundary this breakup has created or reaffirming my attachment to him? im feeling really lost and unsure about this so any advice would be appreciated",1641518977,False,BPD,2022-01-07 01:29:37,1,0,0,"being in the same community as my ex/fp my fp recently broke up with me. ive been dealing with a lot of pain and anxiety over it, but that's exacerbated by the fact that we still exist in the same community. ive been trying to unattach myself from him as my fp (even though i dont really know how to do that) but im still very much attached to him and i know that because ive convinced myself that he hates me despite there being no evidence of that. that's basically how splitting manifests itself for me with my quiet bpd—i internalize all the rage and direct it at myself, and when he doesnt pay attention to me or communicate with me (which he hasnt been since we broke up) i just assume he probably hates me. as you can probably surmise its a really difficult situation being in the same community as him because literally everything he does i take as a sign of his dislike toward me.

"I had to go through a very triggering event today and I thought it would make me backslide but I actually feel BETTER after, I have not been able to say that since childhood (initially wanted to say never)","i have been doing therapy in any way i can find it for about 2 years now, and i finally feel like i am turning an actual corner with all of this. today, i had to go through a situation that i knew would be extremely triggering for me. i hyped myself up and did everything i could to make sure i didn't backslide in any way as a result, i still had doubts in the back of my mind that i would, but i didn't. i actually feel really good about myself afterward because, for the first time since i can remember with a situation like this, i have zero forest fires to put out after. i did get angry, but i did not lose control. my anger was justifiable in this instance, i knew i would feel some.

\- i went to bed every night and played in the background during some days, different frequency music. like if you just go on youtube, they have 528hz or 432, 731, etc. playlists that are usually 10-12 hours long. 

\-  i did a therapy session and watched a ton of therapy session videos on youtube. 

\- i have been trying not to go outside like at all right now because of covid and all that, i did do walks and runs a lot, like today i probably spent 2+ hours running in total. social interaction though, it has been hard because of covid. i had phone calls with people in my circle and i tried to engage with people online as much as i could.

\- if i found myself ""sinking into negative thoughts"", then i watched meditation-videos where they specifically also display psychedelic images to break myself out of that loop.

i told her that i wanted to go to the czech republic and poland because that's where my family is originally from. she told me, ""then let's plan that trip"".

i thought she was nuts but she explained that having a big goal to look towards can help me when i'm having good days and give me something to focus on when i'm having an episode.

so she had me plan my itinerary as my assignment for this week. i'm also to come up with a budget and what else i could need once the pandemic ends and europe opens up. this is one assignment i'm honestly looking forward to.

Just some observations from a healthy relationship,so i think as pwbpd it is very stigmatized that we are incapable of having healthy relationships. personally i have experienced many unhealthy toxic and some even life threatening partnerships. i did let myself believe for a long time that this was just the way it was and that i wouldn’t find anything better. but the truth is toxic partners with toxic traits will always magnify our disorder. it will caused splitting to multiply and often more than not accelerate bpd tendencies including self harm and suicidal thoughts. i experienced this with my expwnpd almost on a daily basis. it was exhausting and traumatizing. but with my boyfriend now i have no issues. apart from the normal disagreements couples go through. we have had not one fight and i have none of the trauma issues with him like i did with my ex. honestly i think who we allow into our lives plays a huge part into our disorder. i shy away from things like fp. because yes is my other amazing? absolutely hands down i love him more than i have anyone before. but i don’t have the obsessive tendencies i would before struggle with fps of the past. life is short find the right people for you and just be happy to have them,1641510816,False,BPD,2022-01-06 23:13:36,1,0,0,Just some observations from a healthy relationship so i think as pwbpd it is very stigmatized that we are incapable of having healthy relationships. personally i have experienced many unhealthy toxic and some even life threatening partnerships. i did let myself believe for a long time that this was just the way it was and that i wouldn’t find anything better. but the truth is toxic partners with toxic traits will always magnify our disorder. it will caused splitting to multiply and often more than not accelerate bpd tendencies including self harm and suicidal thoughts. i experienced this with my expwnpd almost on a daily basis. it was exhausting and traumatizing. but with my boyfriend now i have no issues. apart from the normal disagreements couples go through. we have had not one fight and i have none of the trauma issues with him like i did with my ex. honestly i think who we allow into our lives plays a huge part into our disorder. i shy away from things like fp. because yes is my other amazing? absolutely hands down i love him more than i have anyone before. but i don’t have the obsessive tendencies i would before struggle with fps of the past. life is short find the right people for you and just be happy to have them,observation healthy relationship think pwbpd stigmatized incapable healthy relationships. personally experienced many unhealthy toxic even life threatening partnerships. let believe long time way wouldn’t find anything better. truth toxic partner toxic trait always magnify disorder. caused splitting multiply often accelerate bpd tendency including self harm suicidal thoughts. experienced expwnpd almost daily basis. exhausting traumatizing. boyfriend issues. apart normal disagreement couple go through. one fight none trauma issue like ex. honestly think allow life play huge part disorder. shy away thing like fp. yes amazing? absolutely hand love anyone before. don’t obsessive tendency would struggle fps past. life short find right people happy
"I crave relationships, but I find them hard","does anyone recognize this?

i tend to push my partner away once i feel anxious or depressed, i tend to link it to him or think there is something wrong with him/us while he will do anything for me. i am very open about how i feel and he always hears me and loves me either way.

Freaking out about my bf’s girl best friend,"idk if i’m going crazy and my bpd brain is messing with me but i’d like some thoughts and advice maybe?

so my boyfriend had been planning on going away to switzerland with his gbf and 5 others, i was last minute invited because my bf felt bad about leaving me at home after our own vacation was cancelled. 

it’s day 3 or 4 of our trip, we are all living together in this girl and her brother’s chalet. i’ve been picking up this weird energy between my bf and his female best friend the whole time, they have this weird husband &amp; wife dynamic.  she keeps constantly talking about how much my bf’s parents love her and stuff.  i went to the supermarket with them and i legit felt like i was their daughter. 

then tonight, me and her had a bit of aperol and she got up and danced and shook her ass in my boyfriends face for a good 10 seconds. 

i’ve been in my room ever since literally hyperventilating. my bf says he didn’t like that she did that and assures that nothing has happened between them (they’ve been friends for 10+ years)  but my brain is making up all these scenarios about what could’ve happened if he hadn’t last minute invited me on this trip. 

im freaking out big time and i just wish i could calm down. i have never really been threatened by her as she’s always been so lovely to me but being on this trip with them both as just made me go crazy, they literally act like a couple cooking and watching movies and teasing each other.

LDR Trouble,"i am at a loss for what to do anymore and i just sent the most painful text i’ve ever written; for context, i’m in a long distance relationship and i have been having breakdowns because of distance even though i know it’s selfish to since neither of us (me and my partner) can do anything about it, and i’m probably going to have to move back with my father because of how unbearable my current living situation is. 

he doesn’t have internet or anything so it will be incredibly hard to keep in touch all the time and this makes me anxious beyond belief. i cannot fathom spending hours or days without them and add in the distance, it’s like a recipe for disaster.

no matter what we do together, it still feels so lonely and whenever we call, i end up crying and having to leave before i ruin the mood. i have felt like i need to be hospitalized again before i’m able to get any better. i’m able to show that i’m changing and then something happens and i manage to fuck it up again, only to hurt them in the process. this isn’t fair to them, yet they tell me it’s okay when i know it’s not, even if i can’t control it.

BEWARE OF GETTING TOO COMFORTABLE WITH SELF-DEPRECIATING - SUICIDAL JOKES,"this post is inspired mainly by ""bpd memes"" you can see on instagram or other subreddits. 
talking about our struggles and feeling that we are not alone in our pain is important. 

there is a line though, in which what initially started as a coping mechanism to laugh about something tough, evolves into cheering each other on as you hammer unhealthy concepts deeper into your mind. 

reinforcement is the process in which a behaviour, through the consequences it entails, becomes more frequent. that reinforcement doesn't need to be something that feels good. a lot of thing that we don't like that can act as a reinforcement for our behaviour. 

there are many things that can act as reinforcement and for what some of us x will be reinforcement, for others won't. 

but there is a universal reinforcement: attention. not positive attention, any attention. with anything that we post on the internet, the likelihood of producing the same type of content increases if we get attention in form of likes, praise or karma. you can see this trend from tiktokers that reproduce the same joke over and over again with different people because that one video got viral or folks that talk about politics on twitter who end up being monothematic. 


words have power. don't poison yourself with words. you are not worthless. it's worrisome the amount of memes that emphasize the false idea that there is no hope for your future and that you are damned beyond repair.

Unable to attend school,"cw: mention of suicidal thoughts

Can you change FP feelings into a healthy relationship?,"not sure exactly what to flair this but i really need some advice! 

in my day to day life i've managed to get myself to a point where my bpd barely affects me anymore, but fps are my biggest weakness. i've been single for some time now, but i've been just casually dating around for a few months and it's been fun! i hadn't had any strong attachments to any of the guys i'd been seeing and i'd been very good with just doing my own thing, not caring much about if i'll end up in a relationship or not and just living a pretty stable life overall.

however, one of the guys i met i've become absolutely smitten with, i didn't get any fp feelings with him for the first few months and i just genuinely really liked his company and wanted to see where things could go, but now we've gotten to a point where a relationship seems highly likely, all of that obsessiveness i thought was gone has suddenly hit me like a truck. 

we both like each other a lot and i don't want to feel this crushing obsession for him but i'm already noticing that i'm splitting him in my head if he takes longer than usual to respond and i can't focus on anything but him. i have uni assignments due all next week and i've just been sat here staring off into space thinking about him instead of working!!

i thought to myself, okay i'll take a break from trying to work and do something i enjoy instead, but even then i'll end up daydreaming about him and wishing i could be spending time with him instead of doing literally anything else. he's consuming my every thought and it's honestly so frustrating! i don't want to throw away my entire life and personality for another person again but i have no clue how to stop it :(

Idealization and using people for emotional regulation,"i have a mother with bpd. she was emotionally unavailable and since childhood programmed me to somehow always strive to regulate her, understand her, make her feel comforted and erase what i feel inside. 

i also have bpd. around me people didn't really validate me because of lots of problems-i was shy, we were poor, we didn't have a good house and so on so i was kind of striving for validation. 

now i'm 22, i've studied psychology, i'm generally kind and empathetic person, artistic and aesthetic, with calm manners. people often, often idealize me. most of the people who initiate contact with me are in awe of my artistic skills, my character, my loving nature and so on. most of those people have emotional issues of their own, unavailable parents, being bullied at school or being unpopular and so on. i would say majority of them would have bpd and anxiety. 

now, what they do is that they are completely in adoration of me. they want to be like me, they value how much i've grown emotionally and so on. and what happens is that they immediately start sharing their very intimate and private traumatic issues with me. i sympathize with them, but  when i notice it is a pattern i start to protest that they never ask about me, it's always about them and me being supportive. but they argue that everything is about me in the relationship, i'm the main, they are completely dependent on the influence that i have on them. but truly, there's nothing like it and i feel very alone and disappointed. 

i have a feeling in those scenarios that they refer to the idealized image they have of themselves, projected onto me cause it's also suitable and everything in the relationship is them getting validation from someone so great as me (in their perception). so i'm just a reflective tool. 

what delays me to get away from those relationships is that i'm waiting validation myself and get obsessive with them cause at first they payed a lot of attention to me. 

another thing and the main one is that those people are good. they are not aware of their manipulation. they are emotional, lonesome at their hearts, wounded, sometimes i sympathize so much because i know how they feel and i don't want to leave them alone. they are very talented, write or paint well and just need a way out of their darkness. and some of those people i've known are kind and polite, trying to help everybody. 

but being a ghost in a friendships or relationships, it is a core problem.

What Distinguishes BPD Identity Confusion From Average Young Adult Self-Discovery?,"tl;dr when does identity disturbance cross the line from ""normal"" adolescent instability into borderline territory?

i'm in my early 20's and it seems that every few months i'm a different ""version"" of myself. i have had many fluctuations between gender identities, sexualities, and political alignments that have been quite sudden. i can get incredibly invested in a community of people or an ideology just to completely abandon it out of bitterness. i can go from incredibly principled and passionate about morality to a complete hedonist who doesn't care about anyone or anything, indulging in things i condemned not long ago.

this has also made it incredibly hard for me to settle on a college major. at first i wanted to do animation, then theater. now i want to pursue psychology, but i'm on an anti-psychiatry kick right now and i hate the idea of pathologizing other people. these shifts were all within the span of a year, by the way.

a particularly alarming event is when i made myself incredibly feminine to impress a guy i liked a few years ago, thinking about him constantly, altering myself in any way that i thought would impress him. i have also changed my entire appearance to imitate others that i was obsessed with.  it's hard for me to tie myself to any one lifestyle or aesthetic. 

i'd say my self-esteem is higher than it used to be, but when i think about myself or see pictures i just feel so...fake? cringe? like i'm a character rather than a person, a cluster of neurons in my brain attempting to be a cohesive personality. 

i've been told that this is normal and will probably even out as i reach my mid 20's, but i'm not so sure given the intensity of my phases. it seems like most of my peers, even given the instability of young adulthood, have at least some idea of what they're about and what they want to do with life.",1641493444,False,BPD,2022-01-06 18:24:04,1,0,0,"What Distinguishes BPD Identity Confusion From Average Young Adult Self-Discovery? tl;dr when does identity disturbance cross the line from ""normal"" adolescent instability into borderline territory?

Our sensitivity: the double edged sword,"this has been with me my whole life, but i never accepted it until now. just about all of us here are extremely sensitive people, whether we like it or not. that's just how it's always been. when we're with people, it's like we feel everyones emotions but our own. this can be extremely heavy. i just want to share my story in hopes that someone can find understanding/acceptance of this part of themselves, because it really is beautiful.

i never fit in, from day 1. i knew i was different, i didn't know how though. and when i say different, i don't mean better, but i just felt like i didn't belong. i began to interpret this negatively naturally because i didn't make a ton of friends and when i was little, bullies would pick on me because i was sensitive and definitely was a lover, not a fighter. i would cry when i felt others emotions, and whatever i felt in my own emotions, i felt them very intensely. i'm a man, so as a guy, your friends bag on you for crying calling you all types of names. this was mostly in middle school, so you can guess how that was with a bunch of middle school boys hanging out and one cries, and when he doesn't you can tell he's holding it back.

i'm 22 now and about to graduate college, soon (hopefully i get in) to grad school to be a psychologist. i've learned a ton about myself at college, more than i ever have, but no matter how much i understand myself i feel like there's this huge chunk missing. i worked on being mindful, on managing my thoughts and emotions, meditating, surrounding myself with loving people, etc. what's missing?

i, like many of other borderliners, have a very addictive personality. for reference i tried a small amount of an opiate one time and months later i still think about it. i've quit and relapsed on nicotine at least 8 times. i smoke weed daily. i've been taking adderall 6 days per week. i've never understood why i take so many drugs, and even as much as i'm ashamed to admit, why i love drugs so much. i've never gotten so addicted it destroyed my life, but it makes shit really hard sometimes. i'm on the tail end of quitting nicotine for the 9th time, and as my emotions are becoming prominent once again, i'm realizing one of the big reasons i do drugs is to avoid that sensitivity. all of these emotions will come up and absolutely flood me and overwhelm me, until my mind numbs itself. i may as well make that numbing feeling good, right?

however, this takes us away from who we are... i don't know about you, but the strongest connection i have to my body is my heart. sure i overthink literally all the time, but there's just such a powerful surge within me when i breathe deeply into my stomach and heart. it's so fucking strong, at least 25x stronger than anything i've naturally felt anywhere else on my body. 

for many of us, we feel tortured by our sensitivity. we don't feel we can get away unless we take something or lose ourselves in a conversation, show, video game, etc. but embrace this. please do not run from it any longer because this is a part of the void you feel. it's definitely not all of it, but it's a chunk of it. you are beautiful, inside and out. no matter what you've done or been through or how shameful you are; understand why you did what you did and feel your sensitivity to the situation. feel your chest tense up, feel the tension in your body, and release it. you've carried too much for too long, friend.

we must manage this double edge sword, taking time to feel your emotions and whatever else you're carrying. feel what you need to feel, think what you need to think. allow it to happen. do not make this mistake anymore moving forward though:

for many of us, we feel tortured by our sensitivity. we don't feel we can get away unless we take something or lose ourselves in a conversation, show, video game, etc. but embrace this. please do not run from it any longer because this is a part of the void you feel. it's definitely not all of it, but it's a chunk of it. you are beautiful, inside and out. no matter what you've done or been through or how shameful you are; understand why you did what you did and feel your sensitivity to the situation. feel your chest tense up, feel the tension in your body, and release it. you've carried too much for too long, friend.

we must manage this double edge sword, taking time to feel your emotions and whatever else you're carrying. feel what you need to feel, think what you need to think. allow it to happen. do not make this mistake anymore moving forward though:

do not mistake your sensitivity for weakness.","sensitivity: double edged sword whole life, never accepted now. u extremely sensitive people, whether like not. that's always been. we're people, like feel everyones emotion own. extremely heavy. want share story hope someone find understanding/acceptance part themselves, really beautiful. never fit in, day 1. knew different, know though. say different, mean better, felt like belong. began interpret negatively naturally make ton friend little, bully would pick sensitive definitely lover, fighter. would cry felt others emotions, whatever felt emotions, felt intensely. i'm man, guy, friend bag cry calling type names. mostly middle school, guess bunch middle school boy hanging one cries, tell he's holding back. i'm 22 graduate college, soon (hopefully get in) grad school psychologist. i've learned ton college, ever have, matter much understand feel like there's huge chunk missing. worked mindful, managing thought emotions, meditating, surrounding loving people, etc. what's missing? i, like many borderliners, addictive personality. reference tried small amount opiate one time month later still think it. i've quit relapsed nicotine least 8 times. smoke weed daily. i've taking adderall 6 day per week. i've never understood take many drugs, even much i'm ashamed admit, love drug much. i've never gotten addicted destroyed life, make shit really hard sometimes. i'm tail end quitting nicotine 9th time, emotion becoming prominent again, i'm realizing one big reason drug avoid sensitivity. emotion come absolutely flood overwhelm me, mind numbs itself. may well make numbing feeling good, right? however, take u away are... know you, strongest connection body heart. sure overthink literally time, there's powerful surge within breathe deeply stomach heart. fucking strong, least 25x stronger anything i've naturally felt anywhere else body. many us, feel tortured sensitivity. feel get away unless take something lose conversation, show, video game, etc. embrace this. please run longer part void feel. definitely it, chunk it. beautiful, inside out. matter done shameful are; understand feel sensitivity situation. feel chest tense up, feel tension body, release it. carried much long, friend. must manage double edge sword, taking time feel emotion whatever else carrying. feel need feel, think need think. allow happen. make mistake anymore moving forward though: mistake sensitivity weakness."

Serious issues in my relationship,"me and my fiance have had some tumultuous times in our relationship, most recently its her being oddly reminiscent about an ex she claims to hate. for the last couple weeks she has found a way to loop him into what feels like every conversation. now it gets juicy, she told me the other night she wants to go for a road trip to visit her friends where we used to live and spend the night. she's also very recently become super attached to her phone, always closing a bunch of apps when i enter a room or taking it with her to shower,get a drink etc etc. i can't being this up to her because it will cause a fight and she knows how to really fuck me up mentally when we argue so i avoid it at all costs. i'm not sure if this is me overthinking things and being a controlling tool (if that's the case i'd love to know so i can stop worrying) or if i actually have something to worry about here. she also thinks i don't have bpd and says i fake all my symptoms. i dunno. this is just a rough time for me i guess. i can't handle being alone and i can't seem to manage any problem properly. is it all me?

i often struggle to accept that i could have bpd &amp; bipolar disorder.,"for starters i have imposter syndrome which makes the self doubt worse, i just don’t know, i have most if not all of the signs for bpd yet i find it hard to actually go and get an accurate diagnosis, i guess after a while i convinced myself that it is better to not know but apart of me will always be curious to know, but whenever i think about getting a diagnosis the self doubt sets in, maybe i’m just scared that they will tell me something that i don’t want to hear, i convinced myself at one point that it was all in my head and that i was in some sort of play to entertain people and to help cope with my self isolation, it just feels like a constant lump in my throat and i wish i could convince myself that it wasn’t all in my head and that i am actually mentally ill but i find it hard to accept, i really struggled to accept my ocd diagnosis a few years ago as well, and sometimes i still believe that i am faking my ocd even though i got diagnosed twice.

Relationship falling apart with friend w/BPD,"my friend has bpd.

i of course have my issues but i've worked so hard on being healthy because having happy relationships with the people around me despite my disorder is very important to me.

she has major mood swings and it makes people my discord server uncomfortable, she ended up blowing up at a 14 year old who made some dumb decisions and as a result, got me roped into a situation that wasn't fun and was very exhausting.

i've communicated with her that she needs to do better and that she's making my server unsafe. she knows about my npd and that things can trigger me. but it's like she doesn't care, or she does but she doesn't think.

she also can split on people very easily. i'm very worried that if i leave her, she'll use my vulnerabilities, secrets, and.. photos.. against me. because she's been very malicious to people she's split on before.

i am faced with the decision of going to a dbt ward for another 9 weeks as an inpatient. or outpatient therapy twice a week and try to return to everyday life with additional outpatient help. 

unfortunately, there is no outpatient option for dbt here.

i was previously an inpatient in a psychosomatic clinic for 3 months and was diagnosed with a severe depressive episode and borderline. afterwards, i spent 2 months as a partial inpatient, which unfortunately didn't really help. 

after the clinic, my problems were only really tangible. all of a sudden my emotions really threw me off track, i had to deal with enormous fear of loss and failure like never before. i am completely blocked for many things. i can't judge for myself how unstable i am right now and what i need. 

now when i could start this dbt place next week i can only see someone for an hour a day because of corona, no time off or weekends.

the feeling of being locked up and even more forced distance from my boyfriend and few friends is extremely upsetting and frightening. 

my job training (germany) would have to be extended by a year as a result. 

in the scenario with outpatient therapy... 
in the best case scenario, i would be able to finish my job training in time. but after that, i'd be right back at work. and i have no idea whether i would be able to do that. if i could manage anything at all.",1641456410,False,BPD,2022-01-06 08:06:50,1,1,1,"Seeking Advice.

I feel so selfish (TW - loss of a loved one),"hey there. i just need to get this off my chest and i don’t know if i’m being irrational and selfish or not. 

a close friend of mine recently passed away. her funeral is on friday, there’s a limit of 60 guests, and i wasn’t put on the list. my sister, brother in law, and everyone else in our small friend group was, but i’m the only one who wasn’t. they just kinda forgot i exist and that i was close with her too.

my sister tried telling me that because i didn’t attend the meetups our friends and her family had after her passing, that they all maybe assumed i wouldn’t want to go to the funeral either. but that’s such a load, because another close friend of ours has been just as distant as me and he was put as a priority to attend. 

i absolutely don’t want to make it about me, it most definitely is not, but i can’t help but feel deeply hurt that i was forgotten about and can’t attend my friends funeral. i do get to visit her tomorrow for an hour or so (closed casket pre-funeral “visit”) but that’s not through invitation. and if it was, i’m sure i wouldn’t have been welcomed.

what started off in the relationship advice thread, went to the narcissistic spouse's thread, and eventually led me here. when i read the traits of someone with bpd/bpd tendencies it rang so true. i started watching youtube videos and they all resonated with what has been happening over the course of our 6-month beautifully toxic relationship. the mood swings, rage, love-bombing, gaslighting, and the deathly fear of abandonment. i found all this out during our most recent breakup over christmas and new year. she reached out to ask for a few of her things. i told her i would drop them off. once i knew i would see her, i felt the rush of dopamine flood back into my body and my nerves and anxiety were gone. i felt scared but calm all at once. as i drove to her house later that day every alarm bell was ringing in my body letting me know i was walking back into the scorpions den. 

a flair for the dramatic no doubt but after everything i've read about bpd i don't know how much to believe and how much is exaggerated like my story above. through my search, i've discovered demons that i was unaware of that i was bringing to the table that certainly trigger her. all this to say i don't know how high or low to keep my guards and how astute should my vigilance be.

"Lost two best friends in the span of a month. I’m losing the will to live. I’m scared I won’t beat this pain and move on, in a healthy manner.","long story short. i lost one best friend because i was too toxic. i accepted that. it hurts but i’m moving on.

i didn’t do anything on purpose. in fact, i thought i was doing the right thing of not going to work. maybe if i had gone, none of this wouldn’t have happened.

My BF Always Criticizes(?) Me When I Let Him KNow Something He Did That Upset Me?,"so i'm going to do my best to explain this? it's hard to put into words but i'll try.

but anytime i try to do something for my boyfriend (the most recent thing is asking me to see if there is any extra packing material at my job). i have been grabbing them here and there and even have a box in my back seat i grabbed for him. he mentioned it the other day and he was asking more for things like packing peanuts, cardboard paper, and things to help cushion materials for travel. 

i told him i'm pretty sure we don't have any of those things just lying around (fyi this is all trash to my job-i wouldn't be taking things we need). i'm there almost every day since i'm a manager and i genuinely could not think of a single thing he was mentioning that i've seen just lying around. 

now keep in mind he actually works at my job just one day a week though he got off today and called me right away. we talked about his day and my day and then he said ""i don't know what you were talking about there being no packing materials there! i found so much stuff! so i don't know what you were talking about!"" then started listing it all off. 

the way he stated this made it come across like he thought i was blind or just willingly not getting things for him. i'm sure that's not how he meant it so i responded in my defense but he kept talking so i raised my voice to be heard. the phone call ended shortly afterward because i had upset him by raising my voice.

he called a while later to talk to me and ask a question. everything was fine. then he brought it up again and i let him know he said something that made me feel like i had to defend myself and he could've worded what he was going to say better. but then he rebutted with saying i should've had a better response. this is kind of the typical formula for our fights in all honesty.

he'll say something where i feel like i have to defend myself and i want to defend myself right then and there. sometimes i'm able to but he'll still try to interrupt and as a result, i'll raise my voice to be heard over him. he interrupts like crazy. but then it turns into i shouted at him and reacted inappropriately. then when we talk about it and i mention what he said that made me feel like i had to respond to that he tells me my response was inappropriate.

i don't know if i'm fucking insane but i feel like i'm not shouting at him i'm just trying to be heard. it sucks to also feel invalidated anytime something he says triggers something in me-my defensiveness i guess. and for him to tell me i should've responded better-it makes me feel like i just need to shut up and keep my thoughts to myself.",1643578689,False,BPD,2022-01-30 21:38:09,1,0,0,"My BF Always Criticizes(?)

i told him i'm pretty sure we don't have any of those things just lying around (fyi this is all trash to my job-i wouldn't be taking things we need). i'm there almost every day since i'm a manager and i genuinely could not think of a single thing he was mentioning that i've seen just lying around. 

now keep in mind he actually works at my job just one day a week though he got off today and called me right away. we talked about his day and my day and then he said ""i don't know what you were talking about there being no packing materials there! i found so much stuff! so i don't know what you were talking about!"" then started listing it all off. 

the way he stated this made it come across like he thought i was blind or just willingly not getting things for him. i'm sure that's not how he meant it so i responded in my defense but he kept talking so i raised my voice to be heard. the phone call ended shortly afterward because i had upset him by raising my voice.

he called a while later to talk to me and ask a question. everything was fine. then he brought it up again and i let him know he said something that made me feel like i had to defend myself and he could've worded what he was going to say better. but then he rebutted with saying i should've had a better response. this is kind of the typical formula for our fights in all honesty.

he'll say something where i feel like i have to defend myself and i want to defend myself right then and there. sometimes i'm able to but he'll still try to interrupt and as a result, i'll raise my voice to be heard over him. he interrupts like crazy. but then it turns into i shouted at him and reacted inappropriately. then when we talk about it and i mention what he said that made me feel like i had to respond to that he tells me my response was inappropriate.

i don't know if i'm fucking insane but i feel like i'm not shouting at him i'm just trying to be heard. it sucks to also feel invalidated anytime something he says triggers something in me-my defensiveness i guess. and for him to tell me i should've responded better-it makes me feel like i just need to shut up and keep my thoughts to myself.","bf always criticizes(?) let know something upset me? i'm going best explain this? hard put word i'll try. anytime try something boyfriend (the recent thing asking see extra packing material job). grabbing even box back seat grabbed him. mentioned day asking thing like packing peanuts, cardboard paper, thing help cushion material travel. told i'm pretty sure thing lying around (fyi trash job-i taking thing need). i'm almost every day since i'm manager genuinely could think single thing mentioning i've seen lying around. keep mind actually work job one day week though got today called right away. talked day day said ""i know talking packing material there! found much stuff! know talking about!"" started listing off. way stated made come across like thought blind willingly getting thing him. i'm sure that's meant responded defense kept talking raised voice heard. phone call ended shortly afterward upset raising voice. called later talk ask question. everything fine. brought let know said something made feel like defend could've worded going say better. rebutted saying better response. kind typical formula fight honesty. he'll say something feel like defend want defend right there. sometimes i'm able he'll still try interrupt result, i'll raise voice heard him. interrupt like crazy. turn shouted reacted inappropriately. talk mention said made feel like respond tell response inappropriate. know i'm fucking insane feel like i'm shouting i'm trying heard. suck also feel invalidated anytime something say trigger something me-my defensiveness guess. tell responded better-it make feel like need shut keep thought myself."
"Husband unintentionally stopped taking his meds, but now won’t start them up again","my husband has bpd, which, until recently, has been very well managed. he’s in therapy, found a good medication regime that really worked for him, has amazing communication and he really puts the work in to taking care of his mental health. 

we just moved out of town for my new job and the mail got all screwy and he couldn’t get his meds sent to him on time. he felt physically ill for a couple of days, then his mood started to change drastically. i’d say still “normal” like 80% of the time, but then out of nowhere he’d be mad at me over something that happened years ago or that is just not even a big deal or something that would typically bother him.

at first he was really eager to get his refills back so he’d feel better, but now that he’s back to his pre-treatment brain he’s now resistant to it, convinced that me and his doctors only want him to take it so he’ll be more “subdued” and “manageable” and “a doormat.” which is not at all what he was like medicated, but right now he’s so convinced that everyone is trying to manipulate him and don’t actually care about him. when he’s not in that negative moody mindset, he acknowledges that the way he’s reacting to things isn’t good, that he hates feeling this way, wants to get back on track, but then once that switch flips again he canceled the refills and gets mad that i’m “manipulating” him and trying to “control” him. 

i just don’t know what to do right now. this isn’t him right now and i miss *him* and want him back but i don’t know how to get him there. when he’s jekyll he agrees with me but then he goes hyde, so i never know how to bring it up because i never know which one is going to respond to me. 

any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. i just want him to feel better.",1643577150,False,BPD,2022-01-30 21:12:30,0,0,0,"Husband unintentionally stopped taking his meds, but now won’t start them up again my husband has bpd, which, until recently, has been very well managed. he’s in therapy, found a good medication regime that really worked for him, has amazing communication and he really puts the work in to taking care of his mental health.

Splitting,"i don’t even know if i’m borderline, i just know i constantly change how i feel about people. the constant splitting is the only trait i have &amp; me being paranoid of everyone’s intentions. i do have a way of overreacting but so far those are the only traits. i do always want revenge. but i don’t self harm, i’m not suicidal, i don’t disassociate, i mostly zone out from my add. 
i don’t mirror personalites, i don’t fear abandonment, i don’t have explosive rages i just overreact to things if that makes sense. i feel like i need to overreact, but i’m not impulsive. my main problem is splitting &amp; its driving me nuts. i can literally forgive someone &amp; the next day i’ll tell them never mind because i remember something else they did 3 years ago. 
then i’m the one saying sorry, then i change my mind again. it makes me look crazy. i do this with friends &amp; relationships 
 &amp; they eventually give up on me. it’s unpredictable when i’m going to get mad at them all over again. they cannot deal. one night i tried to stop myself from starting an argument &amp; i started to panic because i didn’t want to keep my feelings to myself. it was a horrible feeling. i don’t split with my family, i’m able to keep my thoughts to myself, but i tend to overreact with them. thoughts?",1643575704,False,BPD,2022-01-30 20:48:24,1,0,0,"Splitting i don’t even know if i’m borderline, i just know i constantly change how i feel about people. the constant splitting is the only trait i have &amp; me being paranoid of everyone’s intentions. i do have a way of overreacting but so far those are the only traits. i do always want revenge. but i don’t self harm, i’m not suicidal, i don’t disassociate, i mostly zone out from my add.

Had a fight with partner/FP last night... Still angry about it,"so yeah we can an argument last night related to mental health reasons. our moods were low and stress levels high. we did make up within two hours and talked it out and were able to chill and play skyrim for the rest of the evening.

but this morning, i think i began to split on them. after i took her to work, i noticed the anger growing. like i feel angry about the argument even though we already made up. 

right now i have this urge to throw things, hit something, yell at someone... etc. i'm picking her up from work in a couple hours and i have this urge to snap at her and ignore her. this sucks because we were supposed to meet up with a couple of mutual friends tonight but i think i'm going to bail on that since i'm splitting on them for no reason... maybe it's because i'm splitting on my gf and those friends are connected to her? no idea. 

ugh. this sucks and i hate myself. i grew up witnessing a lot of fights and dv at my home so the last thing i want is to argue again. my borderline ass sucks at managing anger.

tldr: got into fight with gf. still experiencing intense anger from it despite it being resolved",1643573845,False,BPD,2022-01-30 20:17:25,1,0,0,"Had a fight with partner/FP last night...
