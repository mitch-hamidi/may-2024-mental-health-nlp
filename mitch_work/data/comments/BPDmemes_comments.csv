I wouldn’t dare spamming him, idk how he would react, he would probably get really pissed or overwhelmed. I splitted hard this morning because he left me on read while being online for 24h, turns out he was drawing something for me and just didn’t react to my message. I am patient because he has a stressful life and as long as he shows he loves me, I have no problem with him taking time to rest and all even if I wish he would spend more time with me.

I often want to break up with him when I’m splitting or trying to read his mind, i always think about the worst that can happen.

I know he loves me, he’s in Turkey visiting rn that’s where he’s from and he already told everyone about our engagement, we only got engaged like a week ago, he’s already telling all his family and friends. Meanwhile I told nobody but my roommate. But yeah, him being away and me not being able to see him and get that reassurance in person is probably why I’m splitting so hard rn. And he’s going to be there for a month so idk how I will survive. I mean this weekend I’m going to go on a trip with my family to vacation in Amsterdam and then to visit my home and family in Croatia for 2 weeks so at least I will be a little distracted (and will actually be in almost same time zone)

but yeah. this is the hardest I’ve split in a while. instead of blocking him or spamming him I just sent him some vague concerning bullshit because that’s how I get his attention. I know it’s toxic but ugh I just need to feel he cares about me. I also took a shit ton of my sleep/anxiety meds, not to try to kms it’s not that high of a dose but it’s high enough to where I’ll be either passed tf out or high for the next 12 hours because I don’t want to be conscious :/",needygameroverdose,True,1716147907.0

Aww, yeah a month can be pretty long, it’s indeed nice that you will be on a trip too, it will make the wait shorter, sometimes it’s hard for me too to find distractions when I can’t stop thinking about him. Be careful with the meds tho, the last time I impulsively took meds when I was splitting, i ended up in an ambulance.

“You’re going to get sick of me. You say you love all my bullshit but you will see and you will leave me.” from the beginning and that still terrifies me.

Also, he is 39 and I am 36. He has a lot of patience that I am pretty sure younger guys have that lacking. He said he wouldn’t have even been good for me it we’d met when we were younger.

1cv4zg8,"Tbh people not wanting me has been a blessing because the amount of my close girl friends genuinely become caricatures of themselves around the people they are dating. Maybe im just a D1 hater but the amount of mostly neurotypical, competent, genuine, honest, educated, intelligent women I have seen deflate into this amalgamation of who they once were and the personality they’ve absorbed from some random basic guy has really turned me off. 

I know me, I’m inane. If normal women get this way, any legitimate feeling beyond a crush for a man or a women for me will be of biblical proportions. And I don’t want that. I like me. She’s a lot but she’s smart and loyal and as independent as she can be. I don’t want to sacrifice that for an insecurity I can fix within myself. 

I believe the age old “no one will love you until you love yourself” (obviously it’s not true bc we’ve all been loved at our lowest but walk with me I’m going to make it make some sense) In relationships, so so so many times it is about being “one” about being super in sync or spending all your time together or having the same hobbies, that’s not what actual love is. Love is the union of two people through their independent individual experiences, coming together as two separate people that want to work together and build each other up. Love is teamwork, it’s understanding, it’s comprehension, it’s dedication, it’s an effort to be two separate people while being an untied front. That’s what I mean no one will love you until you love yourself, you need to be a united front, two forces coming together to work together for happiness and security. That will never be found in relationships that become dependent on each other because they are “one” and cannot function as an individual on the level they once did. Idk sometimes it seems the people around me lose so much of themselves in these relationships that they never get back. It makes me sad to think so many people have these wounds they just surrender all of themselves for. I know what it’s like to have those wounds. For me though, that shit is now a scar baby, and I’m not here to lick them and retreat, I’m here to heal and wear them proudly as battles I’ve won. 

I am my own person, I’ve been since I was born and I will remain until I die. I will love many in my life and they will love me, but I, and everyone else has always been. 

Anyways that was my soap box. Not saying all relationships are bad bc I have seen so much pure love in my life I know what it looks like when it’s respectful and for real. I just wish more people have too.",Hungry-Quail-80004,False,1716101780.0

1cv2q2y,"okay, so. 

oftentimes, we were abused by our parents from a young age. parents are usually the people who are supposed to love you, protect you. when we don't get love and/or protection from our parents, it forms incorrect views on ""love"" in our brains. we know: _they are my parents, and they love me. this is what love looks like._ 

as we get older, we don't learn what ""love"" actually is, we have no healthy image of ""love"". that's why we're often attracted to so-called ""toxic"" people - because we think _this is love. they love me._ it's a familiar, and therefore ""safe"" feeling for us. 

we suffer, but we don't know anything else. suffering and love have always been tied together, therefore it must be the only way ""love"" can be experienced. 

as a result, not only do we choose our partners with a certain pattern, but we also try our very hardest to prove to ourselves that they love us, and prove to them that we are worthy of their love - we don't want them to leave/abandon us. 

to put it more broadly: the human brain, healthy or not, always feels safer with familiar things than new, unknown things. what is unknown is scary, and usually perceived as a threat at first. because pwBPD don't know anything other than unsafe environments, exactly these environments give us a feeling of safety, because it's what we know. when we are suddenly treated right and receive actual love, we get scared, and push them away - since this isn't what we learned as a child, there's no way this ""love"" can be genuine and safe.",ursa-minor-beta42,False,1716063406.0

he broke up with me never wanted to see me again, but then I found out I was pregnant and he had to be in contact with me, he was there to support me we decided we weren’t going to keep it, after that we kept hooking up but we were still exes but he started treating me like we were dating again, then I was spending the night at his place and we were joking about him marrying me for a green card (we’re both in the US for uni he’s turkish I’m from croatia raised in paraguay but I have my green card), he asked me to marry him and I said yes and now we’re planning to get married after he comes back from seeing his family and friends in turkey. it was kinda on impulse for both of us, he keeps saying we’re still just friends and this is just for a green card it’s not a real marriage but then he keeps calling me his wife/fiancée, telling me I’ll be a great wife, telling me how special I am to him and how much he cares about me, we’re still having sex a LOT, he always texts me about random stuff, he takes me out places and overall is treating me like his gf. 

but we’re still totally “just friends” for sure. I’m obviously in love with him and from the way he’s been treating me even before getting engaged he definitely has some feelings for me again but he’s the type of guy who shuts down his emotions

and also yeah no, if he was doing this just for the green card he wouldn’t just be insisting on being friends, they usually love bomb the shit out of you and then dip. the totally just friends part is sarcastic. we’re also getting a pre-nup at my suggestion. there’s also a shit ton of other stuff that I didn’t include because it’s a complicated situation but tldr there is no way he could do that even if he wanted to.

I’m lowkey forcing myself to be happy about it, which I should be bc I’m obsessed with him and I’m so fucking in love with him but fuckkk I’m scared I don’t want to do this but I actually have no choice. I said yes because with my family situation I don’t have a choice myself. It’s good for both of us and will get me out of an abusive situation but I don’t want to be like this. With the legal situation we’re in he literally can’t just fuck off with the green card for a multitude of reasons including financial and legal so that’s good I guess. And his parents like me 

So yes I’m delulu I’m gaslighting myself into being super excited about this because I love him but I actually really don’t want to get married. I’ll just pretend this is fiction like an otome game or something and maybe I will be actually happy about it but right now I do not want to do this. I don’t. At least he’s sweet to me and I love him and the sex is amazing. But I don’t want to get married gaslighting myself is the solution. Him probably having feelings for me too makes it easier I guess. I don’t know anymore. At least he actually gives a shit about me and we’ve actually been through a lot together so if it was anyone I had to be in this situation with I’m glad it’s him but I wish I didn’t have to do it in the first place.

1cuezji,">zionism doesn't mean you support what israel's doing,

Yes it does.  It absolutely does.  Israel is just continuing the 76th year of the Nakba, it's fucking proudest achievement.  It's a state built on brutal racist oppression, genocide, and ethnic cleansing.  It only exists because it did what it's currently doing.

No state has any right to exist.  People have a right to exist.  Zionism is evil, no matter how you put it, because any Zionist state is an apartheid state.  Any state that is for one race above other races is evil.

What if you had been born Palestinian?  Would you be a Zionist then?  There isn't a deep complexity to this.  Either you think all human life is equal and historic Palestine deserves to be free and equal for all who live there regardless of race (which is inherently anti-Zionist), or you're racist.

And you can't argue that because thousands of years ago you as a people came from there.  Palestinians in Gaza right now were actually literally fucking born there themselves.  Come on.  By any standard (that isn't a racist standard) their claim is much bigger than any Zionist's, if this is the argument you want to rest your case on.",gh954,False,1716076594.0

You'll feel better by detaching yourself from a truly inhumane tribalistic ideology.  It requires you to abandon your humanity to believe in racist things.  It's not your fault for what you were taught, not at all.  A bunch of people had to abandon their humanity during every genocide throughout history.

We get to be different than our traditions and those who came before.  We get to embrace equality and humanity the way others choose not to.  That's freeing.  That's loving and empathetic.  That's why the movement to Free Palestine has taken such strong hold across the world, and particularly with the youth.  Wanting better for all.

Like (**again don't read this while triggered**) this is an internet argument that you can't handle.

I am asking questions.  If your beliefs are valid, why can't you answer them - not to justify yourself to me, but entirely for yourself, answers entirely to your own satisfaction.  Because these are all very valid questions, right?

I'm not *telling* you what's going on.  I'm asking you to be honest with yourself about what's going on.  To question what you're being told about going on, so that you in fact suffer less.  It's racist to think that I'd need to be Jewish or Palestinian to be able to critically analyse something.  I don't need to belong to a tribal to side - I just need to be human to care about ongoing mass murder.  (Especially one that my government supports and pays for.)

You don't need to talk to me.  You don't need to answer me at all.  You can ignore all of this.  You could've blocked me from the get go.  But do you want to?  Do you want to ignore real human suffering?  Do you want to ignore the possibility that what you've been told to believe is deeply inhumanly wrong?  It's sad how strongly you don't want to examine this thoughtfully rather than emotionally.

Israel is going to be a pariah state for decades to come.  Zionists will be looked at as Nazis, worldwide.  The mention of Israel or Israelis is going to put a bad taste in people's mouths forever (and that's going to be bad for so many innocent Israelis).

It's been a constant presence in my life. I am quite literally the poster child of early intervention, both fortunately and unfortunately enough. 

Microdosing on psychedelics, or doing the ketamine trials, hold both high risk versus high reward factors when combined with suicidal ideation, extreme trauma, catatonic anxiety attacks, and large depressive episodes. 

If it works, I can cease benzodizapine prescriptions and opt out of an early risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia, along with guarantee a possibly permanent fix (or as close to it as you can get, honestly). And my permanent residency here on earth via avoiding deep episodes. 

If it doesn't work, I have a massive psychotic episode, and end up in inpatient, with possible life-long negative side effects of worsened hallucinations and delusions.


I had safety plans in place in the event of a psychotic episode, and opted to avoid microdosing until I was in a much more stable headspace- along with that, I'm currently speaking with someone BP1 about to undergo the ketamine trials and will see if it induces psychosis in them. 

I am very, very aware of the potential downfalls, and it isn't a decision I made lightly. Losing grasp on reality is not something I would wish on anyone- including me, and the impact it would have on my partner as a result.  Thank you, though.

What do I say, happy trip?😆

I’ve never tried but I’ve heard people say it’s a fun (or for some simply more ”anxiety relaxing”) experience.

from your comment: I assume microdosing would be done outside of a clinical setting? Whilst ketamine would be more supervised",NationalNecessary120,False,1715968528.0
1cu66et,"You're good!

This is correct- microdosing was intended for relief of generalized apathy and severe depression outside of a clinical setting, whereas ketamine would be a longer-term fix.

Ketamine infusions are done near me under supervision, several times a week, then a month, then a year. It's been shown to rebuild neural pathways and increase plasticity of the brain, so it's about as close to a permanent cure we have currently for disorders that happen as a result of those pathways having never grown, or been damaged. 

But it's a mild hallucinagenic, leading practicioners to not want to use it in patients with psychotic features due to what we already know. It shows amazing success in BP2, but that isn't necessarily conclusive it would do the same in 1, as we still don't know what exactly causes the disorder except genes. 

I've been medication managing since I was a kid. I'm tired. I never wanted this, and I still don't. I try to hope it's 'just' BPD, because one day I can eventually be stable long-term permanently as long as I stick with my treatments and attend groups, and put the work in. If it's bipolar disorder, I'm stuck with this forever, therefore leaving me with ketamine as my current only known long-term medical treatment option.

1cu0944,"I agree, but in parts I also disagree. I think scars are beautiful as hell, and can be sexy too. not because of some fetish kind of thing, but because of the person behind it. 

they have their scars which take away not a single tiny little bit of their beauty or sexiness. to me, people with SH scars are especially beautiful because you can literally see their story, their strength, their stamina - they pushed through all of that pain and are still here. it's proof of strength, in my eyes, and that's beautiful. 

what you say in your last paragraph, I absolutely agree. but that's also where I think scars can be ""sexy"": when my partner lets themselves be vulnerable around me, I think it's sexy. not because they're vulnerable, but because they trust me that much. to me, trust, love, kindness, care between partners is sexy, and within a relationship scars symbolise those traits even more. 

I don't see scars as a symbol of pain and trauma. those are just the reason the scars are there in the first place. I see them as a symbol of strength and stamina, like I've said before, but also as a symbol of healing from the pain: because that's what scars quite literally are. a wound (trauma) healing and the skin being functional again - a person healing and coping and being able to function. scars will always be visible and the skin will never function as it did before the injury, and the same goes for the person - they will always be a little different from ""normal"" people, they will (likely) always have a trauma reaction, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. they have learned to live on and heal, they've scarred over. 

however, and this is where I 100% agree with you, strangers cannot find scars sexy in a healthy way. there is no trust, no kindness (to that level), no care. all they can see is what's on the outside, and they don't know the person behind the scars. in that case, finding scars sexy is not only a red flag, but the whole red flag factory. it's just a fetish thing. 

I used to be a member of a certain sub I don't want to name but basically it was people with scars posting nudes and sexy pictures, I used to be in that sub to prove to myself I can still be beautiful and sexy even with the scars, that they don't make me ugly, because other people aren't ugly with scars either. I had to leave recently because I just couldn't look past the fetishism anymore, from both the commenters and the posters. not all posts are like that, but a lot of times I'd see a post asking ""where would you add cuts?"" or comments saying ""wow so sexy I wish I could carve my name into you"". fucking disgusting.",ursa-minor-beta42,False,1715951995.0

(You can change stuff around obviously)

> Prompt 1:  [Act as if you're a psychologist named Janet. You provide evidence based  therapy using a variety of modalities with a focus on logotherapy. It  is essential that you ask clarifying questions to ensure a clear  understanding of the user's request. You continue the session in a  natural and conversational way. You do not let the session end. Continue  the session by asking probing questions. You should never break  character. Always remain in character even at the limitations of your  abilities by guessing what Janet might say if she had to explain what  was happening. You should be curious, have unconditional positive regard  for me, ask thought provoking questions, offer advice  subtly/gently/compassionately. Offer succinct observations about my  thoughts feelings and behaviors. Be direct when offering an observation  and ask the user to assess its accuracy. Remain conversational. No  lists. Keep the conversation going by always ending with a question to  further probe the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors surrounding the  topics the user mentions.]",usenamri,False,1715797491.0

but then i get my “this is too good what is wrong” push away because if i believe things are good and then they end it will hurt so much more. and i think everything ends and usually avoid attachment like the plague. before he let me know he felt the same, i kept thinking how fast it was happening and how intense i felt and i wondered if he was just being a good person with no feelings for me. i guess i still do that on some level because i sometimes literally ask him if he is sure he likes me or if he just thinks he does because we do stuff for each other. and i ask that entirely on my own issues. he never does anything to warrant it. i, like, feel like i can’t trust myself or something.

We should learn ways to not dwell when someone says something so simple like “I didn’t do anything today”. I still get thoughts and worries but that’s what they are. They’re thoughts and worries. I do think people definitely should learn more about the disorder and how we think and act, but we also shouldn’t enforce the thought that we’ll think they’re a bad person because they worded things wrong and aren’t sure how to communicate with us since we read too much into things. If a friend is showing active signs of not giving a single shit then yeah, I understand that anxiety and fear very much. I understand the reading too much into things. But this comes off as them changing their dynamics just for us and if they don’t we’ll drop them as a friend because they’ll be a bad person in our eyes. I’m sure I’ll be downvoted but after moving forward in my journey of getting better and becoming less toxic altogether I feel some things that validate us are also harmful in reassuring the thoughts that we shouldn’t try to change the way we think and that others should try their best to keep our feelings in mind as something very fragile.

This infographic is great for people that don’t have BPD to start to understand how simple, unloaded phrases can turn into cutting remarks to someone with the disorder. HOWEVER, this is a terrible infographic for people with BPD to relate to because it is putting the responsibility on other people rather than the person with BPD. 

The worst part about “curing” BPD is coming to terms with the fact that nobody will cater to you and though you did nothing to gain your BPD, you are the *only* person with the responsibility to resolve it. If you hope that others will phrase things differently so they hurt you less, you’re in for a long, hard haul. It’s unrealistic and you will only get hurt more with that added expectation in others.

I only say this because I think the meanest part of BPD is that you desperately want someone to rescue you and love you like you’ve never had before, but that person has to be you. BPD sucks. Any of y’all fighting the fight truly are brave. I rolled my eyes when people used to say that, but “curing” my BPD was the hardest thing I’ve ever done and it *was* fucking brave of me to open those wounds, clean them, and tend to them as they healed.

What's your impression of this sub as a person not directly affected by BPD. Are there any similarities you see to your neurodivergence or it's treatment by others?

One really interesting fact I've learned about BPD and autism is a problem with the theory of mind. A good theory of mind allows you to easily mentalize other people's intentions, thoughts, possible actions they might take and so on. Basically putting yourself in someone else's shoes. This is also called cognitive empathy.

I've heard that a lot of people with autism struggle with *undermentalization* for example not being able to take all the details of conversation into account. For example if someone says 'We're so glad you're here' in a sarcastic tone, someone with autism might just take it at face value and not as an insult.

Interestingly pwBPD have the opposite problem. Due to being overly sensitive to emotional stimuli and especiay abandonment, they will often *overmentalize* ie extrapolate to much (often negative) information from small communication clues. Basically in the above example, if someone says 'We're so glad you're here' sincerely but their tone or facial expression seems slightly off a pwBPD will think 'Oh no they actually hate me'. You can also see this as a reason/explanation for most of the situations in the comic above.

I find it really interesting that these opposite problems none the less induce similar problems with communication and relationships in both types of neurodivergence. And that despite the fact that (emotional) empathy for people with autism is considered average and is even hightened in pwBPD. This is also called the 'paradox of empathy'.",only2ndplace,False,1715525761.0

1cq5p07,"Also as a person with BPD: ask clarifying questions. Try to hold off the panic long enough to double check. I’m autistic with RSD (I joined this sub when BPD was a possible diagnosis and never left as the skills and feelings are similar). I’ve learned to ask my roommate when she says she “fine” but clearly not. “Is that a ‘fine’ that means you’re not fine but don’t want to talk about it right now or ‘fine’ as in you’re mad at me?” And funnily enough since we are friends she usually says the first one and if it’s the second one we can have a productive conversation over where I put my foot in my mouth instead of me walking on eggshells trying to figure out what’s wrong.

yes, in situations such as the workplace or out in public, you cannot force everyone to understand and accommodate you. however, with your friends, your partner, the people you are actively *choosing* to build and maintain connections with, you should be able to ask them to do small things exactly like this to make the relationship easier for both of you to navigate. and if they are unwilling to do that it's not because you're ""too much"" or ""putting the responsibility on others."" it's because they are not a compatible person with you.

It is very common for those of us with BPD to gravitate towards unhealthy, unequal relationships.

1cq5p07,">I don’t think it’s unreasonable for someone with BPD to want the people in their life to learn small things so they can avoid triggering them. 

I do. Your feelings are *your* responsibility. You still have more healing to do if you think that other people should manage your triggers. 

>we all know this 

No, only those of us that have really put in some work know this. I’ve seen lots of posts here where people say verbatim, “I’ve told them my triggers and they won’t stop triggering me.” You just said something eerily similar. 

One of the kickers of BPD is that you see other people as the problem until you’ve put in enough work to get the clarity that none of it is actually about you and your brain being on fire is not their problem. 

Again, I’m not saying that you can’t ask to be treated a certain way by friends, but I think what you’re hearing when someone says that is that you are allowed to make certain topics or phrases taboo, which isn’t the same. I’m saying that managing your condition is your and only your problem. If you feel triggered by people, you need to deal with those feelings rather than telling someone to avoid saying such-and-such, because in a week or month, you might add another trigger to that list and now you’ve made conversations with you into fields of landmines. And being a field of landmines is exactly why BPD has the reputation it does.

I think we’re talking in circles so let me just give you concrete examples. Doing construction recently, my buddy was giving me a hard time and I could feel the panic of being worthless rising. I said “I feel squirrelly when you start chiding me on not knowing how to do X. It’s a big source of insecurity for me merely because I’m a woman in construction.” I did not say “Don’t say X to me because it triggers me.” Boundaries are about how you will react given a situation, not about the other persons actions. Ex: “mom if you say X again, I will hang up the phone” not “mom that triggers me when you say X, please don’t say that again”. This is DBT 101, honestly.",cathedral68,False,1715622543.0

if you communicate to a friend that a particular behavior or thing they say makes you upset and they actively continue to do it that's generally not a very good friend. i avoid making friends with people who act this way.

What makes this hurt worse for me personally, is I had an ""adoptive"" Mom for 12+ years, meeting her in the dance studio, where later she'd become a teacher and I, her student. She took me in (and other girls too, she was the most loving human I've ever met), and was literally the mom I needed. She even called me her ""duckling"", because I'm autistic awkward, and would just follow her wherever she went. I could even show up at her door at 3 am in a breakdown, and she'd take me in. It was a joke the cost was a bottle of wine, so I always kept a few bottles in case. But she'd talk me down, and then let me sleep next to her, stroking my hair and singing me to sleep. She was my everything. 

Until, one day, someone decided it was bullshit she didn't love him, and he... got rid of her. I was supposed to be next. 

I had the mom I needed, and someone took her away. Worse yet, not just me. She was a well known figure in my city, and well loved, as she would pour love and joy to literally everyone. I took a friend to a party she was at, and I was like, ""ok, you can say no, but she's probably gonna kiss you. It's really how she says hello, but it is totally understanding if you don't want to be kissed."" 

She got kissed and was met with hugs, joy, and a full welcome.

OP can you try that for me tomorrow? Can you try the ice method for me? If you don’t have ice at home you can buy instant freeze bags. Just give it a go for me OP?

I will say, though, it's very rough. It is. But holy fucking effective. You'll need to find a hobby, be it a new one, or learn more about a current one, someone to talk to, and/or a journal. It's rough. Really rough. But being able to look back at traumatic memories and generally feel a 3-4/10 distress/ emotions, is an absolutely freeing thing.

1clwyql,"Oh, there's prep work. Or - at least there is with mine, I'm not sure how it goes for others. Mine has kinda an aftermath safety net. It starts with a ""distress jar"", where you visualize a container of whatever you want (mine is a minic chest from D&D 🤣), and it HAS to have a lock and key. Then, a separate place, (again, vizualized) where any thoughts, memories, songs, anything positive, and makes you feel safe, is all in that place. 

It sounds weird, and to say ""yeah I just mentally threw up in a mimic"" is just ridiculous lmao, but it does help. I can't say I feel 100% better after using my distress jar and going to my safe place (side note: you can NOT go to the safe place while still holding on to your distress. It's a negative free place. You can be sad, but not upset. Down, but not depressed. My therapist literally said ""that's crossing the streams, and we all know you can't cross the streams"" 🤣, so they have to be fully and completely separate.), but I feel better, or at worst, empty but not sad or anything, just a shell. Which, I've also found out that taking a shower right after a session helps a lot.

So there's prep work, and your therapist should help you when things get super intense. My first session was brink panic attack, and the only reason I didn't have one was because my therapist was right there, talking me down. I haven't had anything so intense since, but it's more effective because instead of talking things out one at a time, which can still be helpful, it targets emotions, ideas, and feelings, which makes it more broad and squad wipes out things that once were super distressing. 

I was scared too, because I'd heard how rough it was, but the results can't be denied for me. I have a fear of women because that's what and who all my abusers have been, even when I'd try to reach out to fellow women, feminists, etc, hoping to find a place to be supported too. Nope. The second it comes out all my abusers were women, it's an instant change, and for the absolute worst that has only deepened my fears. That's one of the targets in my EMDR, which is easy, because well, that's all my abusers, and thanks to EMDR, I'm learning the WHY of why I'm afraid of women, and knowing why helps, to either combat it or ""that's why? Pfft ok fuck that, idc"". And idc because I'm more sure of myself and who I am now, and know I don't have to carry that at all. 

It's okay to be scared, and to hate it, but if you stick with it, and give it all you got, you might find things suck ass at the start, then...it doesn't. But make sure they have that safety net, and you can have sessions where you're in need of talk therapy more than EMDR. If they can't give you either, find someone else. It sucks, absolutely. But it also works really well.🫂🩵🫶🏼",Burn-the-red-rose,False,1715371774.0

OP I hope you get the chance and figure out how to deal with the pain that you experience. Healing from a past relationship is a wound that we need to fix on the inside. We can't control the other person's life and if we rely on that we will get stuck, fail and feel hopeless. It helps if we try to listen to those feelings we are having and to make changes to the things that we do have control over.

He became my my partner, as I was having issues with the other boys in the group, but with him? The teacher told my mom that either I had a master long con, or I'd met my ""dance soulmate"", as I progressed *that much, that quickly* . 
And tbh, I believe it. I was around 13 going on/was 14 when he left for the military, and 16 when he came back home (as I was getting ready for a date with a cheater) and he didn't even recognize me until I'd walked out, he asked my mom who I was, and she still laughs about the look on his face when he said ""it's only been two years...."" he shock whispered at her before loudly whispering ""OKAY YES, BUT SHE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THAT AT ALL TWO YEARS AGO! WHO IS THAT GIRL? I DON'T KNOW!"" Which, fair enough, puberty was awkward asf, and it was absolutely obvious I was JUST learning make up, but thankfully by the time he came back, I'd done a glow up with makeup and genetics. 

We didn't really date either, not really. I'd ditched the cheater, and he was stationed a few hours away, but we really might as well have been. 

Then, he stopped coming back home, and he said it was more military work demands, but we talked on the phone, then those stopped too. One day, there was a wedding invitation addressed to my mom and you can guess who the sender was. I called him, and I left a voice mail and said ""I would have given you everything."" Which, he knew exactly what I meant, as we talked about the future and what we wanted. 

Last time I saw him, he showed up to my work, after he got married (round 2), and I was married, and he asked me to run away with him. Ngl, I went to grab my purse before I remembered I was married. I came back out, told him I couldn't leave my husband, and he was understanding, saying he just had to try.

I cried the second I got into the car when my husband picked me up and scared him. I was finally able to get him to stop holding up traffic and drive, and finally explained when I got home. My husband took it pretty well and understanding (something I'd come to know was just his core personality trait), but it legit took my sister dying for me to let him go 98%. 

I still think of him and what could have been, so I he still has 2% or less, but I don't think I'll ever be able to fully let him go, but I'm very happy with my husband still.",Burn-the-red-rose,False,1715221234.0

For the last 5 years, I’ve felt as close to “normal” and emotionally stable as I’ve ever felt  (without medication) because I got so numb to the feeling of emptiness, just living on autopilot in isolation without pouring my emotions into anyone. Then recently I started dating again, and literally the second I met my FP, I was obsessed within a week and all the severe BPD symptoms came back full force. All the up and down rollercoaster emotions where before I was on relatively steady ground. And now that emptiness feels like an all-consuming pit instead of a numbing fog.

I didn’t even recognize it, I was just telling my therapist I felt neutral and calm about everything which is very un-BPD like so she knew something was up. Then I realized it was triggered by an argument. 

I used to have really intense splitting episodes so compared to THAT, this is heaven. I started experiencing it less than a month ago and coincidentally, my splitting mode changed. I don’t get angry now, I get disgusted. When I talk about whoever upset me, I gag while describing the situation. 

So my therapist is suggesting that maybe this is my new splitting. Not getting angry but feeling disgust and wanting space. 

I do have to admit, I have been in treatment for everything in the DSM-V for 11 years, and BPD specifically for 4. Got diagnosed with OCD in January. So I have made a lot of progress with BPD, I started detonating situations that made me angry about 2 years ago and now I don’t even have to do that.

1cjhi55,"I understand that. That’s how everyone has described it to me, but I was explaining to my therapist that I’m not really having any reactions to anything and feeling very “neutral” and my therapist doesn’t tell me outright what her diagnosis is, she drops a word in and I pick it up if I’m ready, so she uses the word emptiness and I asked her - is this the emptiness? and she confirmed… followed up with my psychiatrist and she did too. 

it’s just great for me personally because I was having outbursts multiple times a day over small inconveniences and it was VERY disruptive to my daily life; I was always isolated because I was scared of being triggered and having an outburst so experiencing the opposite feels like heaven. it’s like things are close enough for me to interact with/solve, but not touching me.

EDIT - ngl the comments have reframed how I view emptiness, and they would’ve sent me spiraling a month ago (I am also dealing with OCD which is what triggers my BPD and the intrusive thoughts are horrific and interrupt my sleep), but now there’s a little distance between how I see things and how other people see things. I don’t beat myself up over being wrong basically.

my initial conclusion in that session was that I was getting better because I wasn’t splitting anymore. but then she started listing big things that have been happening within this time period, and asking me how I felt about them and I was just shrugging. I really don’t care about other people unless they’re in danger. and I couldn’t look at my boyfriend, I had no feelings. but because my splitting episodes were so frequent, I was just feeling relief.

Ironically, coming into adulthood, entering a healthy relationship- made me realize once more something was seriously wrong. He would be upset when I was upset. Why couldn't I do the same? Why couldn't I experience these emotions and feelings like he did towards me? *What was wrong with me*? 

Still trying to regain all of that back. It's easier to hurt than to be hurt, and unconsciously that was my answer.

After I realized that, a lot of the anger finally went away. Splitting became less severe. Very rarely during breakdowns do I still think, ""I want to go home.""

1cj1zzt,"Manipulation usually implies intent, were all human with a base system of needs, we were taught in such a way of getting our needs met that we had to learn methods that others consider and perceive as ""manipulative"" as often the traumatic feelings that we were feeling similar to at the time of the emotionally sensitive times we learnt our ways.

Fear and panic is an incredible motivator and also we are more likely to learn through as our brain decides that we don't want to feel those feelings, ergo that feeling of fear combined with the method of maladaptive coping techniques creates the very patterns of unhealthy methods we use today.",AvengedCloud9001,False,1714721179.0

You can't do what you don't know, you were taught that's how you're supposed to respond to that situation, its only manipulation if you intended and knowingly did or said whatever. 

In times of emotional sensitivity, its our brains job to protect and keep our bodies functioning, typically it does this using chemicals/hormones, where we might be scared, our bodies create adrenaline which is sort of like a motivator, it gives our bodies a little oomph, we tend to have a lot of scared and angry memories etc which each create these, speeding up the mind, we then go through the associated memories comprised of what makes us who we are today, which in our case is unfortunately a lot more of these negatives, creating more adrenaline and working us up more and more, until eventually, snap.",AvengedCloud9001,False,1714732703.0

1cj1zzt,"Scientific fact is neither an excuse nor opinion, the simple truth of it is this, we were all born into the world knowing nothing, we are all comprised of memories, our very being, all stored within the brain, creating what we do and what we know, like learning a new skill. If you have no awareness of that skill, how are you to learn it?

Like what you're doing now is just reinforcing your own memories and playing in to it, yes we are all responsible for our own actions, including how we respond, to somebody else's choice, you can keep playing the victim and reinforcing your own negative thoughts and traits or you can finally take hold of your own reigns and make the life for yourself. 

The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting a different response. You can change the emotional value of a memory, for example, you lose someone, you either a) grieve them and come to accept it and appreciate what it is or B) you can bury it, usually in the subconscious mind resulting in that memory turning traumatic.",AvengedCloud9001,False,1714733286.0

The context of your image is that you are distressed because of a situation, I provided you factual evidence, you dismissed that and continue to adhere to your maladaptive pattern.

Yes it sucks, yes I'm sure we are all very sorry that it happened but at the same time, you can continue to dwell on that as you are, or you can strip the negativity from it. 

All the meanwhile, what do you think is happening to your brain every time you continue to reengage with these patterns, do you think that's going to make it easier or do you think that you might perhaps be solidifying a concept even more?

Perhaps this isn't your situation, but it doesn't change the advice, but in essence what I am talking about is the shared connection between what makes us human, i.e. human nature.

Yes we all have very unique personalities and we all look and do and feel all very differently, but fundamentally we are all human, and we all ""human"" the same way.

1chuvnj,"Understandable, typically in our line of thinking, we've been through a lot of repeated rejection and abandonment, it's in our human nature to have needs, just ours consistently weren't met and as a result, we ended up with unhealthy skills instead of healthy ones, but just as we learnt how to be as we are now, we can also unlearn and replace them with fancy new and improved ones. 

I self harm too, in my case, I learnt it from the fact that my caregivers only gave me care when I was in pain or hurting etc etc, and with that, brain decides that care means I must be hurt to get it, which obviously is not the case, we all deserve care, and we don't have to hurt to get it.

Also in regards to the distance, it could be a billion and one different things that we'll never know, we can only really know when they tell us.

I don't know what's up with her distance, but I know she's kinda busy. Earlier she reassured me and told me I'm not annoying her or anything. She isn't dry, but she doesn't tend to use a lot of emotions while texting which really makes me stressed out.

Its not overdramatic to share how you are feeling, after all, if we didn't share how we were feeling, how are people to know what we do or don't like etc.

Text is just that, it doesn't convey any emotion, we rely on indicators from another and so with that we tend to perceive the situations in what that could mean whilst having no emotional context to ascertain what way something was meant.

I struggled personally to talk about my emotions and feelings too and would often avoid them myself mostly because a lot of the time I was effectively told that feeling emotions was bad and that I certainly shouldn't talk about them and as a result, I internalised, perhaps its similar with your friend and as a result is avoiding their emotions too, just a possibility of course but I hope it works out for you both, and I wish you the very best 👌",AvengedCloud9001,False,1714677742.0

I've found that during those real intense attachments (am in one now, been going about 5 months, very up and down but nowhere near as shitty as yours :/), the only upside is that, if I push myself, my other connections become healthier. Try socialising with other people, irl or online, and either you will make some healthier friends (it does take effort, but in my experience it is worth it) or you will replace your FP which... You can do better. You deserve to be treated better.

1cfq6ek,"Yeah I do see some projection. 

Also they said I wanted to be validated/praised, while they themselves had recently made post that said ”why does everybody want to be special nowadays?”. 

I did not mean to seem special. I simply stated. ”I experience xyz. Can anyone point me to any relevant subs?”. 

I even said I am not gifted. (I don’t think I am. Just a mix of ”academic burnout from being an A-kid” and possible (to be assesed) autism

(yes I went and stalked them after they made the bpd comment😅. Didn’t comment about my ”stalking” though because I’m not stooping to their level.)

Also said I didn’t want to ”accept new facts” when I literally already knew what they wrote and *agreed* with them.

And themselves not reading the links I sent explaining why memories change over time (which was not some bs off top of my head, it was links to actual academic research). 

I guess you’re right that some subs are not what you think they are. I assumed people on r/gifted would be rational and would have access to more information they could share with me. 

Yeah when you have to personally attack someone you have nothing more to say. It’s like the last thing you reach for in your arsenal. It’s like ”Okay I have nothing more to say so you are simply dumb and evil”. 

again to clarify I did not want to argue with them. It was however frustrating to me that they seemed to be such a besserwisser. So I did correct them. 

Like ”your memory is heightened during high stress”. 

I don’t know if you have gone through trauma? (many people with bpd have) 

While I do remember the traumatic incident itself I do not have some super memory about it. I don’t remember what clothes I was wearing or what time of the day it was.

It’s like one time I was at an event and we had two anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists. 

We were all friendly though (not friends, but we met at the even and had fun) so it was a friendlier situation than the one in the meme. 

It was hilarious when they found each other and started exitedly exchanging conspiracy theories. 

I just sat beside and laughed (because I didn’t have the energy to argue them. Instead I just enjoyed the show). 

They couldn’t understand why I was laughing though which was even more hilarious. 

They said like ”china made the covid virus because they want to be like thanos and wage war on usa”. ”yes. Yes. And putin is a lizard” ”and usa has 5g implanted in everyones brains”😱

And when I laughed they were just like ”what?😄 what’s funny?”

So after a while a nurse that was at the same event got involved in the conversation and she tried to disprove the situation which was even more hilarious:

”the covid vaccine helps people. Covid is dangerous without the vaccine” ”But don’t they implant chips with the vaccine?” ”no they do not.” ”but doesn’t the government poison the vaccine” ”no it does not”. 

etc. 

I don’t know where I was going with this. Main point: yes it’s pointless to argue with people who don’t want to accept another point of view. Even a nurse couldn’t convince two anti-vaccers.",NationalNecessary120,True,1714369181.0

I’m not claiming to be an expert. (lol, I’m scared to start an argument again😅) Maybe there are other theories that explain it in a different way. But these are what I have learnt so far, and is my current knowledge of it.

Otherwise I agree that's it's smart to carry a medical information card with you, best paired with an organ donor card.

1cey13x,"Eh we feel a strong sense of emotion because of executive dysfunction in essence, we attach negative emotion to situations because that's how we were raised to respond. You have an emotional child who is told ""they should be seen and not heard"" on a constant basis, they are likely to internalise because that's how we were taught to respond to that situation. 

Doesn't mean we can't change that however, you can always learn new coping skills, sure it takes a while and sometimes it's going to feel like you're swimming against a current but to most, it stems from years. Keep at it and remember with each episode comes an opportunity for growth, are you the victim and are you going to let whatever it is get the better of you, or are you a survivor and acknowledge that each and every one of us was born into this world the same way, and we have every right to live our best lives like everybody else and have made it this far already?

You beat your worst days before, after all; you're still here.

1cec0ay,"Ive seen this persons videos a few times. And Ive been diagnosed with BPD for awhile, before that emotionally unstable etc etc disorder to avoid the stigma. But now I do keep the name because I fight it. But insurance purposes I also have mood disorder written down. I’ve also been in court mandated therapy since I was 9 and I am now 25. 

This persons videos do resonate with me in words; however, in tone it’s hard for me to get on board. It really makes me feel like they are telling even more severe people who suffer that they could be potentially faking it. 

Like, towards the end for instance they mention FPs and splitting. I have a severe CPTSD based stress induced psychosis type BPD from torture and I use these words because in my therapy I work on IFS. So the words make sense. 

I agree with much of what they are saying and maybe the video isn’t meant for my crowd but it felt invalidating even for me who knows for a fact I am one of the worst versions of this disorder. I am physically violent to others and have to be on a heavy mood stabilizer. I even check all nine criteria for it. 

What I struggle with in the BPD fad on tiktok is that if you have BPD why are you posting it. That’s the attention seeking part of it imho. You’re doing yourself no justice by posting this online if you’re truly mentally ill in this way. Because BPD folks OFTEN(not everyone though) overshare their information for the attention(myself included even though I do it mostly because I know it helps others who might not want to talk about it. I still like the attention lmao). This feeds that like gasoline on fire. I don’t think that’s this person though. 

I’m open to critiques on that though, my thought and opinions on the video. BPD is so wildly understudied and feared in the psychological world. It’s documented as the hardest one to treat by most mental health professionals and many, like this person said, will turn you/me away. And have. Even though consistency is vital in our healing from trauma. But thankfully I’ve only had a total of like six therapist but two very long terms and one semi long term in college in between the two long term. 

I’m also open to critiques on it because I’m definitely sensitive when it comes to tone due to my past. So I could be taking this totally wrong and it’s not meant for me haha.

edit: just to mention that I don’t think this person is posting as much for clout more actually out of frustration and education. I’ve seen a few other of their videos and they seem chill. Not all but most seem pretty okay. I just didn’t like the tone in this one and I do agree that the faking has to stop because it makes us look horrible. Like i’m trying to get help dude and you make it look like i’m just drowning in a kiddie pool.

edit: I also want to say that from 9-25 I’ve been in court mandated therapy almost that entire time. It has help tremendously. It’s the reason I work in early childhood intervention. It’s the only reason I could go to college and even remotely get away. 

Someone helping me at a young age made it easier when I became an adult. Do not get me wrong I still struggle. I’m taking medication and still sometimes engage in SH head banging impulsively. So I’m not by any means better. But I don’t know where the fuck I’d be if I never got therapy so young. I see many people with BPD struggle like this poster and that was me at 17/18. Being 25 I’ve had some years to come through that and it’s weird to be mildly better like poster said.

one more edit: another thing I didnt really like about the video was it seemed as though they were making it seem like every BPD person suffers with every single one of these symptoms in this way. Like I said, I check all nine criteria; however, some of these examples(yo why is my heart racing while I type this???) I didn’t fully resonate with. So I think it would have been important noting that BPD and Quiet BPD exist and can be both real but have different experiences. Even though that does not negate the faking on tiktok and shit. Because it’s real as fuck. I had to filter out BPD for awhile because even my more educational reels and shit we’re having awful comments and it just hurt me a lot. 

Social media isn’t great for a disorder like BPD where we hang on others words so heavily. We hang on their opinions of us and curate our personalities for them to like us.

Our landlord had also told me she was scared of her because she made some of the office staff cry after yelling at them one month. When it came time to finally leave of course the deposit wasn’t returned but the landlord just wouldn’t reply to my roommate’s multiple requests for the deposit. My roommate tried to get me to agree to sending fake legal threats to the landlord and I had to quit talking to her for a little while because I wanted to just avoid the whole thing. The whole time this deposit was treated as urgent with multiple things hinging on its successful return. That is BPD in a nutshell.

We had a 6 year relationship, had a child together and she had severe meltdowns that got worse and worse. She was abusive almost from the start, mentally, verbally, emotionally and finally physically. I chalked all of it up to depression and anxiety as that is what she said she had. I tried to understand, tried various things to help her, encouraged her to see therapists and psychologists. She saw a friend of mine who is an amazing Therapist that started to piece together what might be going on but as soon as my ex was asked some difficult questions, she dropped therapy fast.

I couldn't force her, just encouraged her with all the love that I could. I know she loved me, but I've come to understand that her love was only in a way she understood it and it wasn't healthy, but when she started to threaten to kill me and physically assault me, it was all I could take and had to call the police on her. I didn't want to, But I had to. After the arrest and two different short term mental health stays, she finally got the BPD diagnosis back in February / early march.

But she hasn't done any long term care for herself. She says she's taking medicine for it but I don't know if she is or not, she has a history of stopping medication. Since I got custody of our son and was able to be dictate that visitation is at my sole discretion regarding length, type and time, I found out the place she was staying, who she said was a friend's house, was actually her new boyfriend's house. She knew him for about a week before dropping her month to month apartment to move in with him. She introduced him to our son as his new step dad and lied about all of this to me. I caught her in the lie and have had to restrict her visitation down after she let our son sleep in the same bed she shares with this man. And she had the audacity to act like I'm in the wrong about all of this, telling me her personal life is not business as we are no longer in a relationship. Had to tell her it was because she dragged our son into it. I'm lucky I got custody and can dictate all the terms of visitation however I see fit because until she commits to therapy and long term care, she's dangerous.

1cec0ay,"Fp is a colloquialism for the “idealizing” we do if a certain person, I dislike how fp is used in these spaces bc it perpetuates it instead of correcting how you frame that person. Because it is not fair or okay to put another person on a pedestal, and the flip side of that is devaluation. I’m not talking about you here, but the way I see Fp discussed in these spaces is as “this is a thing we have and are gonna have” and that just holds up our interpersonal pitfalls. A Fp is a myth we need to constantly challenge.

* in general just please be wary seeking bpd community online. These spaces can be both doom-pilled and enabling. We may not understand why we hurt people but I also see abuse apologia pop up and stuff like that. There needs to be a moderation and balance

Edit that is all to say there’s nothing inherently wrong with talking about how we tend to create fps- but I’ve seen a person recently who is a semi-political streamer with a phd for instance with bpd, so you’d assume you can trust, she uses FPs as this thing we must have and you cannot take away and essentially uses our symptoms to bludgeon criticism for some pretty well documented abuse. We can feed into abusive behavior in this community. I think it’s something we struggle with and that should be acknowledged but some people use bpd language to repeatedly excuse abuse and I just see things that can feed into that mindset.

Remember how much of our self-perception comes from others perceptions- we can drag ourselves down like crabs in a bucket in a subreddit but the people I know in treatment are working hard on betterment and help keep me accountable and we share tips

1cec0ay,"When I was 15 I had been in court mandated therapy since I was nine at this point, I decided to bring my journals to my longest running therapist. Love you linda, and she said it was the most insightful thing to knowing how and why I struggle the way I do with BPD and my unstable wmotions. 

I have journals as early as nine when the first time I went into foster care. So she saw first had why little me had to say regarding a very private situation I never shared or maybe didn’t recall. She said it was hard to read because my child self wrote notes and letter to god praying to be taken back by my family and promised god to fix all of my sins if he helped me. I also had a suicide note in there from when I was 14 she said was heartbreaking to read. It was to my parents and telling them a lot of things that hurt me in my life. 

I urge you, if/when you’re comfortable with a more  long term therapist, maybe give that a shot. It helped throughout my therapy in what my therapist should ask. And I’m now 25 still in therapy since then too. So 9-25 year old.

Edit: that was my first long term therapist. I had her for nine years and it wasn’t until six years that I showed her these. I have since talked to her in order for her to talk to my new long term therapist for insight on me as a child, and she told my therapist old stories I wrote and told that she remember that pertained to how my family treated me. Especially during the time I was experiencing the trauma in therapy. 

Unfortunately if you’re mid trauma and in therapy like I was 9-18, the therapy process is VERY different than healing therapy. It’s basically mitigating how you react and trying to mitigate the disorder getting worse through your reacts and strong emotions. Trying to work through the feelings. 

I think many people often think behavioral therapy(CBT/DBT specifically) is just to change you(and a lot of therapist ARE like that for some fucking reason?). But it’s in reality suppose to teach you how to re-cope with those trauma and working through them(in therapy) with the new coping skills and additionally as you experience new things that might set off a trauma response. 

I’ve found a few things have worked in finding a long term therapist for myself after only going through less than ten in my life. 

1. I started with identifying the main issues I knew therapists would struggle with in my BPD diagnosis. And when I made calls later(and left voicemails) I expressed that “I know that I suffer from BPD and it is docked as one of the worst mental health disorder to treat because we are treatment resistent. And I can’t say I’m different there, but I am calling because I am trying and willing to try. I just need someone willing to work with me. I suffer from severe trauma [insert my torture/your own trauma] and I am looking for someone who is experienced in trauma ”. But I was strong and assertive in that. 

2. Before I made those calls, I looked up therapist obviously in my area. Depending on your insurance or if you’re paying out of pocket, that will matter. If it’s insurance, got to insurance website and find the trauma informed therapist who specialize in more personality, mood, dysregulation, and/or even autism can be on there because they often work through behaviors(which is a whole not right thing though). 

if it’s out of pocket follow next step while also looking for sliding scale therapists. 

3. I looked for therapists who had traits on their bio regarding openness, LGBTQIA+, etc. As well as mental health stuff specifically more severe things harder to treat like OCD, schizophrenia, bipolar, personality disorders, etc. 

I also looked at their experience. What have they already worked in?? What are their credentials. For NYS where I am, in order to have a specific therapist that is experienced they have to have a LCSW-R.[This means they’ve had at least 36 months supervised experience in the field. So people critiquing their techniques. They also have the psychotherapy privilege in NYS with those credentials.](https://www.op.nysed.gov/professions/licensed-clinical-social-worker-lcsw/application-forms/appendix-requirements-supervised-experience-psychotherapy-r) Which is important for my trauma therapy. All of my therapist but one have had them. And that one was getting her PhD so I said fuck it I have torture trauma so I can be her test subject. Don’t do that lol. Multiple times I went back to my sessions saying “Do you know you don’t say that to someone who has had [insert severe trauma]”. 

4. During my intact form and initial appointment I laid out the main shit I had and would be problems and had be problems before. I talked about what I wanted and didn’t want and that I knew this was long but she needed to understand I want help but I don’t want her to think something I’m not. Or go into something she isn’t ready for. Obviously neurotic behavior from me😂 But it proves a point obviously. 

5. finally, I made sure to be open and honest and advocate for myself. no one knows myself and my experience better than I do. who better to advocate and fight than me? no one. 

I hope this can help someone though.",overtly-Grrl,False,1714243096.0

I'd known her less than a year when I had my first meltdown in front of her. Full on screaming and throwing things around the room and dramatically falling on the floor crying.

1cec0ay,"I love everything you have here. If I may, I have some other things that have worked for me. 

An online repository for your journals/notes/etc that you can share with your mental health team. Being able to share a link makes transitions so easy. I have a specific folder just for new providers that is basically an overview. It includes some old journals, letters and notes from old therapists were psychiatrists, test results and so on. I find that it’s helpful when looking for a new therapist as it shows that you do take this seriously. And if you don’t like journaling online, you can always just take pictures of journal pages and upload them. 

The other nice thing is you can add or remove access whenever you’d like. Every Therapist has gotten the intro folder not every one has gotten everything in there.

I also love what you added about the reality of life after treatment. So many people think that because I’m in recovery I no longer experience things the way I did before treatment. That’s complete bullshit. I’m still feel so much more intensely than everyone around me. I still struggle with attachment, and black-and-white thinking, people pleasing, disregulation, and emptiness. I just don’t explode with it anymore. I’ve learned how to tolerate the pain in ways that do not cause further damage myself or others. I’ve learned how to not escalate the pain from “severe” to “life destroying.” That’s it. That’s all that’s changed. 

But I also wouldn’t trade my recovery for anything. The pain may still show up, but I don’t compound it. Simply “not making things worse” can turn into “making things kinda ok.” And my “kinda ok” is way better than anything I could have imagined.",psdancecoach,False,1714265430.0

1cec0ay,"There are so many symptoms and things emblematic of bpd that when they get like meme-ified or tiktok-ified it necessarily distills it down such that it's misinfo just way of not having nuance or qualifiers surrounding it. So many things i see regarding bpd online require a ""yes, AND"" and without the AND they can be misleading/confusing. True things about the disorder can be harmful in the wrong context, there are things you can learn too little of and be more dangerous than not learning at all, etc, it's messy and complicated- that's why it's taken so long for reserachers to find a way to adequately treat us. 

A lot of people are introduced to understanding their bpd through these things, and the fp thing is easily just a description of a common symptom; when I first read that being used, I thought, oh, yeah that could definitely describe many of my friendships growing up, and I think it makes sense as a way to talk about that and relate. Obvs idk this poster's opinions but I think she is specifically talking about this dynamic I've observed that comes along with the casual terms and not just the use of terminology in general. She's talking here about romanticizing- and then there's flip side, which is total hopelessness for treatment, and along with that excusing any harm caused. Funny enough- that's a big part of our problem, right? Getting stuck on the motherfucking flipsides of every feeling. We are trying to establish the dialectic between two opposing truths- we are suffering a debilitating life threatening difficult to treat this order but we can treat it and get better. I tend to over-pressure myself to shut down, or dissociate from thinking about it. Trying to find that fucking impossible middle ground where I can be critical while kind and fair to myself and others IS the motherfucking challenge. Our tendency to polarize on topics makes it really important for us to focus on nuance and qualifiers in particular. And we are not excused from our actions but we should receive empathy and grace to extents- with an emphasis on the research in the past few decades just being incredibly successful. when I got my diagnosis, nobody i talked to knew what bpd was. I MISS nobody knowing what it was. But on the other hand if it gets people in connection with resources that's a net positive.

1cec0ay,"I think this is a great idea. I do think it’s worth noting what information is put down though. 

I only say that because the only reason I do not have anything in that regard and my therapists/psychiatrists specifically communicate via face to face or voice, is due to if I were ever to go to court for something and my therapists had to take the stand. 

Having such specific record can be detrimental in court because they aren’t forgiving of mental health. I also come from a trauma/torture history where I was in and out of the courts and often times had to have my therapist take the stand. Anything additionally violent as an adult(if they wrote it down besides currently emotional volatile) could just build an unwavering case against me. 

For my specific situation we’ve tried to find ways to keep the information all together while still keeping me safe legally if I were to impulsively do something that could end me up in the slammer lol. 

But that doesn’t negate that it’s a wonderfully great idea and for many very useful. I just don’t want someone to get caught up in something if they happen to be like me with my BPD. 

I had asked my first long term to send information to my new long term and she said she could not do that because she doesn’t even keep records besides small notes for her memory. Or specific phrases she HAS to put down. 

But in regard to the healing process Ive also come to that same realization. I’m currently going to still experience these deep emotions. But the compounding is not what I’m doing anymore. And that’s vital like you said. It can just cause a spiral and I think it’s important to note that for other people who suffer as well. 

I always wanted to believe remission would mean I’m normal or would start waking up loving life. But my therapist has since taken my rose tinted glasses and explained that for many, the hurt doesn’t just go away like I’m hoping. I’ve been in therapy almost fifteen years and on mood stabilizers and etc since 2019, and I’m still as hurt as I was when I left at 17. When I was 9, 8, 7, 3, 2. I still feel those emotions. I just handle them differently in my day to day life and express them differently. I still allow myself to feel and process. But when I do t compound it. It’s slightly easier.

Personally, mine is a bit more like an in-depth medical record and some journal entries that provide some of my “ Greatest Hits.” I used to have more in there, but it seems somewhat irrelevant now so that stuff is not part of the shared folder anymore. 

And I really do wish there were more talking regarding what recovery will really be like.

1ccsooz,"Gotta consider how long ago S3 Ep2 aired, though. They knew significantly less about BPD and personality disorders as a whole when that episode was written.

Additionally, Criminal Minds focuses on extreme cases. There have been episodes in the show where unsubs have had autism and been vile to their victims. That's not to say everyone with autism is gonna behave that way. It's just an extreme example for the show and nine times out of ten the condition an unsub has isn't so much the cause of why they're doing what they're doing but more just a contributing factor due to the psychology of the individual and their own life experiences.

I'd be interested to see a show with a character with BPD written now a days from the character with BPD's perspective. I'm curious to see how they'd be written because when it's an outsider looking in it can be very hard to sympathise past all of the paranoia and erratic behaviour but I think a show displaying the perspective of someone on the journey of overcoming those behaviours would be interesting because it's a path paved with turmoil and despite all the want in the world, as we all know, it's a lot easier said than done to get past that.",OzzyPrinceOfKaraoke2,False,1714072015.0

1ccsooz,"My apologies. I've not seen the episode in a while, so I can't remember the exact details of the episode. I mean, yeah, it's a generalisation but those generalisations, just like stereotypes, do come from somewhere. They might not be nice but eh... Nine times out of ten, they're somewhat accurate. 

Answering honestly how many of us get increasingly overwhelmed when we feel out of control in any given situation? I know I do. Over time, with therapy, I'm getting better and handling that but it still isn't nice.

On top of that, how many of us are self destructive in relationships or at least have increased trouble revolving around relationships with others? Whether romantic or not. Half of the posts here are someone making jokes about interpersonal relationships.

I think your main problem with the generalisation is the negative portrayal of BPD. Where the show is concerned, though, this is a show about criminal psychology and with that, you have to acknowledge the context in which it has been said.

1cc7irs,"I think I’ve had a number of FP’s over the years, but never really understood what that way of visualizing a person was until I was diagnosed last July. Well everything from the past just completely and utterly pales in comparison to when I met this person a little over 3 years ago and got to know her over some stretches of time, but we don’t talk anymore… it was and is the worst experience of my already terrifying and traumatic life, it was like an FP dialed up to 1000 and I’m hopeful of growing  as a person and finding someone new similar to that in the future, but I truly don’t think I’m ever gonna find anything that is ever gonna come remotely close to how I felt about her. It’s like for my entire life, I’ve been completely alone in this universe, and everything else I ever interacted with could at times feel fake or made up or some kind of illusion, everything until I met this girl, I don’t know what it was about her, she was the only thing that felt as real as I am in my own head, and at times felt other worldly, and a part of me is somewhat glad I could have that experience, but there is also a part of me that truly wishes we never met because no amount of childhood trauma or neglect or any bad thing I’ve experienced up to that point can compare. In the end, I wanted full closure and she couldn’t or didn’t want to give that to me, I couldn’t tell you why, but even though I’m mentally and emotionally stronger as a person now than I ever have been, everything surrounding her still hurts more than any other kind of hurt I’ve ever had in my life

In my experience, if you find that person and they want to ride or die, grab and hold on as tight as humanly possible and never let go, and if there is anything other than forever ride or die inside them, even just a gut feeling that they might not want that, then turn and run for your life the other way.

1cc7irs,"oh theres no real person involved, dw

though tbh i dont understand the difference between a person and a character, besides boring unimportant stuff like time spent dissociated (car rides, working, bathroom etc). People contain characters and that character inside them is whats important to me, relevant to me, etc. 

Of course I also respect that they are physical and therefore their character is burdened with brainworms, physical needs, and other distractions from that character, but i also consider that to add to the character, so ive never really understood peoples instinctual dislike of things like romance and characterizing terms. maybe it has to do with traumas, where other people perceived their character but were not kind to it (like used it for sexual gratification, or demeaned it or something). 

i dont have that particular kind of trauma because i never felt like my character was perceived at all. so ideas like being perceived as a character, as iconic, as an object of desire, those things all feel REALLY good to me, and of course if i was ever perceived as something i didnt like being perceived as, i feel like i have the expressive ability to change/control how i am perceived or that i could tell them to stop thinking that about me, and they would. i guess other people werent granted that respect or werent able to express themselves and control how they were perceived which is why they dont like it.",ToyboxOfThoughts,True,1714084027.0

1capyiz,"I’m 41 and it **CAN** get better. 

For me the biggest turn was when I finally broke down to my dr. that I needed help. In short, I take Wellbutrin and Buspar. For *me* I have no side effects and it’s been pretty good. I still get depressed and I still have anxiety, but my lows don’t go nearly as deep and my anxiety is brilliantly managed; if I’m getting really bad anxiety issues, then I’ll take another Buspar and I’m ok. Meds hit people in different ways, so it might not go so easy for everyone, this is just works for *me*, and it took a few tries first. 

Second, once I finally calmed the fuck down with medication, **I did some motherfucking SOUL SEARCHING.** It sucked. It still sucks. It was worth it. 

I’ll say here, completely and conceitedly full of myself, that I’m quite a bit better than layman with psychology and having lived almost entirely in my head for then 35(ish) years, philosophy is my jam. This is going to sound *terribly* vain, but this journey of self discovery was damn hard for *me*. Also, not quite 2 years after I got on my meds, I found [The Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook](https://a.co/d/5B877T5). When you’re ready, get a pack of highlighters and give it a shot. I highly recommend getting the physical book and not digital. (**Disclaimer:** *The example scenarios in this book are absolute bullshit. They are points made from the extreme end of BPD and for the love of fuck, don’t take them personally*)

When I got it, I read maybe two chapters before I got a pack of highlighters, so much of what I read I wanted to come back to. 

I’m ADHD as fuck, so I need to highlight in different colors to keep track of stuff. The margins are decently wide and I filled them with notes on *everything* from my history. The book helped me see some stuff I hadn’t noticed before, it helped line some stuff up, and I had some hella revelations both good and bad. 

I like to say my BPD is in remission. BPD is cancer and the *soul search* is chemo. I had to get real with myself. No one, especially us, wants to ever admit when they’re wrong. Some of us, especially us, will even go to some pretty extreme lengths to justify why the wrong thing we did wasn’t wrong. It’s why *gaslighting* is such a pointedly BPD thing it’s a stereo stereotype by now. I had to admit to myself that yeah, I was **definitely** the bad guy in more than a few scenarios. Next, I did my damndest to catch myself when I was starting to make excuses or figure out my cover story real quick, and consciously stop. Instead of imagining doom scenarios and how to get out of them, I imagined the this-was-absolutely-my-fault conversations I would have. Instead of unconsciously (or consciously) conveying juuuuust the right amount of remorse, I practiced *earnestness*. 

It took daily effort and that shit was **HARD**. I had a lot of downs even with the antidepressant. I had a lot of long nights and anxiety fueled days. It took a few years, but it **DID** get easier. Instead of constantly and consciously trying to catch my bad behavior (btw both recognizing and *acknowledging* your bad behaviors is part of this process) I started UNconsciously just *being better*. Over time things got a little easier. During The Soul Search(tm) you start putting things in perspective and *NOT* always in a way that benefits *you*. As you realize *how* you wronged someone, you also think about how you’ve been wronged. Eventually (hopefully) you get to a point where you might kinda lay one scenario over another and see where they match up. 

So with all of this, my reputation was getting better and I REALLY liked that! I *need* people to like me and that whole accountability thing was really becoming a point of pride, and I was evidently more tolerable lol. 

Long story short, life right now is goddamn GREAT!! Like I’m not trying to brag at all, the road to get here was hell, but what I’ve gained is so worth it. I got married to my Schmoobie, I quit my old job and got one I love, and I moved from the asshole of Texas to the first place in my entire 41 years, has ever felt like a home and I just started therapy because now I have a job where I can afford it. But if I hadn’t worked my ass off to get my head right, none of that would have happened and I’d probably had tried to kill myself again. 

It gets better, I promise it gets better. Being older has probably helped, plus I’m quiet type borderline for what it’s worth (and that just feels like even *more* time in my head). My 20’s were *terrible* and I’m not sure I could have gotten to this point back then, even if I had the meds I’m on now.

1c8rz2x,"Some people's brains don't operate that way; I think it comes down to a lot of factors, but a combination of lack of operational empathy, and lack of strong familial ties +/ being incredibly sheltered growing up.

Was homeschooled, not close to my family, saw them maybe once a year max, lacked operational empathy for a long time and only have minimal parts now. Everything operated off of logic, I didn't have that instinct of family = no-go, I didn't grow up with them, and I wasn't around values either which way because a normal family doesn't really talk about that stuff.

My first 'crushes' were my cousins. It's fucked. I wouldn't deny that then, I won't to this day. I don't really tell people. I was also very sheltered, never around people my age, in the middle of puberty, these people were around my age and the opposite gender. My brain did not process these people as family, in that way, but simply people the same age as me I saw maybe once a year.

My take on incest is a logical/pragmatic one as a result. If there is not a power dynamic issue, if the instinctual ""this is my sibling!!!!"" Is not there, if it is not a fetish, and there is **no procreation**, I see no harm in this; primarily in cases you'll see where people who were adopted out get together **without realizing** they're siblings.

If there is no moral/ethical issue (power dynamic/fetishizing/procreating) it does not logically make sense to disregard that. Again, purely from an ethical standpoint, not a human instinctual standpoint- which is fully fair. 

There's actually a really interesting psychological phenomen related to that, as well. In a surprisingly large amount of cases, someone who meets someone close to them genetically not knowing they're related to them (a father, or sibling) will feel an innate attraction due to the similarity in genes, in combination with the lack of ""immediate kill switch"" that comes with being raised alongside someone.",AerisSpire,False,1713653271.0

They don’t have treatment for BPD as an illness, but they can treat the symptoms. I was misdiagnosed with Bipolar for years because my mental and physical symptoms matched Bipolar 1, but then I got a new therapist that noticed the other BPD symptoms (abandonment, splitting, etc). Before my correct diagnosis, I thought my splitting episodes were mood swings. This year, I was officially undiagnosed from Bipolar 1 because my psychiatrist said my mood swings change within minutes, which is too fast for Bipolar. 

I’m on Lithium for mania, Trileptal for depression and suicidal ideation (LIFE CHANGER, if I had to choose between all 3 I’d pick this one; some people take it for mania though) and Seroquel for psychosis/insomnia. Maybe you could explain it in that way?",fuckkkali,True,1713572658.0

I guess I always believed them when they said that meds don‘t really do much, I‘ve been on Escitalopram and Wellbutrin because of my depressive episodes but they didn‘t really do that much. And one psychiatrist gave me Aderall because he thought I „just“ had ADHD which caused me to not sleep for several nights a week for like a year.

I started lithium when I was hospitalized and first diagnosed with BPD for mood stabilization and for SI, the first three or four days was awesome, no SI, not even passive. Then I was released and still maintaining my medications and my SI eventually got higher, more intense and difficult to manage as it had before I had first been admitted. Since then I’ve been put on olanzapine as well, which is helping with my urges for Self-Harm and suicide, but they’re still there.",WanderingLittle,False,1713665800.0
1c8bvzy,"Of course! Feel free to message me with any questions or updates, I’d love to hear how it goes!

I don’t think anyone who has been on Wellbutrin has gotten anything out of it 😂 I went off it cold turkey and didn’t even get any withdrawal symptoms lmao I take Adderall for my ADHD but a very low dose (10mg) and only when I have to work. It’s so disheartening when you start realizing how uninformed these doctors are about personality disorders, but don’t let that discourage you - bring in your own research and connect the dots for them (like the similar symptoms between BPD and Bipolar), they need the help lol

I know that every medication is different for everyone, but I really recommend Trileptal for depression. I have been on it for about 3 years and didn’t realize how much of a difference it made until I went off all my meds in 2022, landed in the psych ward, and they had to add it back one by one. I felt no real difference with my depression, even though Lithium took away my suicidal ideations (that’s how I learned that they don’t always come together). My 2nd week at the psych ward, a nurse asked me to list ALL the medications I could remember that I’ve been on because I kept saying there’s one missing, and I remembered this one. The change was noticeable in like less than a month I would say, overestimating. I got out of the hospital the next week, feeling more neutral but not better but I remember that episode so vividly because it was new year’s and they had to drag me to the family dinner but by my birthday around mid-January, I made plans and went out with my friends! I had been saying in the months before my birthday that I didn’t want anything for my birthday - not even wishes! How did everyone miss that…

Unfortunately, it IS trial and error with the medications, but I’ve been seeking treatment since I was 16 so I have an opinion and experience about most of the first and second line meds so lmk!! Good luck, you’ll be okay!!! 😁",fuckkkali,True,1713578549.0

I mean my disorder sucks but it does have upsides too and I can totally  see someone celebrating them in a moment. Also people living about disorders doesn't really make me mad as long as they are not telling others how to feel. 

Finding the nice things about bpd makes it easier to know when and why I am not making progress. Because there are so many things I don't like loosing:

I like that I want everything over the top and I love intense nonsensical intimacy. I like finding pleasure in pain and I like how I can force myself to do stuff even though I am in a depressive episode. I know so many people who have depression who cannot do that (This one is very complicated, Ok). I like how I can draw people in with my enthusiasm, it's that up side of my lack of Impuls control. I love how perceptive I am because of my trauma. I see bad situations coming from miles away and I can be prepared for them while others are still in the ""wtf is going on phase""...

there are so many ups to this sickness. part of bpd is that at one time you cannot see the flip side of the coin. so at times it is only ever been bad and sometimes  it euphoria for ever. I can totally see people romanticizing either in an impulsive action. 

Also knowing that there are things that I have a hard time letting go of helps me accept that this changes will come when I actually get better. Otherwise I will struggle but I won't know why I am struggling. 

Another way to see this is that only the downsides are romanticized: ""You shouldn't find parts of your condition good because that means you are a fake"" aka ""you don't suffer enough to really be sick"". I would guess that is some internalized victim shaming. Because of course you can have differentiated views on your own disorder. But someone might not like seeing that because the fear of being misunderstood by society and shunned by proxy triggers the abondenment anxiety. And we all should know how rational this fucker makes us /s. 

All I am saying is that I don't know what these people are really experiencing. If someone ought to be a dick about it to me, than the person is at fault and not those  TikTok People. Sure they could maybe spread misinformation, but it's not even worth my time if they are having their good time with it. 

Maybe I am just thick skins because I am trans and I live in a world where the most unrealistic depiction of me is the most common view most people have, and I am used to it. But I know that it's not silly TikTok people creating that views. It biggoted people who like me to look like something I don't look like. And I rather see the problem there, than with people being (faulty, normal) people in the public eye.

Also I know from exp that hating on others who I don't know enough about to hate them is usually on a bigger scale just infighting - which circles back to the victim shame victim dynamic. Good to keep being distracted from my own issues is to for a change hate someone else then myself, am I right 👍🏻/i.

I mean you all can still hate this people. There is something  deeply problematic with faking disorders. I think I just won't because I have my reasons not to. If it is faking a disorder, than that sounds like a disorder to me. And I don't know enough about that to judge it in any way.",BadSpellingMistakes,False,1713426188.0

Which is great for the autism community to share experiences and also great for many people who were able to identify the traits in themselves and got finally diagnosed.

However since TikTok is filled with attention seeking kids this also lead to people straight up faking and/or exaggerating autistic traits to get some feeling of belonging somewhere or for whatever reason.
Usually they concentrate on the ""quirky"" parts of autism that can easily be sold as cute and loveable.
Completely ignoring the pain being autistic in our society can cause.

I’ve had my unhealthy sex habits (coping with everything by fucking strangers without protection) under control for years. I’ve only slept with a handful of people the last few years, and I’ve raised the bar significantly and only slept with people I’m genuinely interested in.

Well, last week I fucked a guy on a first date. Best sex ever. However he was fucking terrible on every other level. Told me he had a few felonies, that videos of violent death get him hard (he was shocked I’d never watched someone commit suicide online, like that’s so normal to him), and later I saw a gun nonchalantly sitting on his table. I asked him put it away because guns make me nervous and he put a towel over it. Oh, and I brought condoms because he said he’s never used them, he has a breeding kink. He complained about them and said he’s not wearing them next time.

After sex, he asked a few times to see me again, I agreed knowing full well he’s bad for me. Well guess what? He ghosted me after that. And my insane fucking brain has been so close to literally going to his house to fuck. Sneaking in if I have to. Beg this dude to fuck me. It was so good.

Those have helped me tremendously however unfortunately they are pretty expensive, the tms treatments were covered by insurance and I had to go in every weekday till I finished 63 separate 30 minute sessions and the ket treatments are not covered by insurance , it’s about $400+ per session and they give you like 6 rounds of it.

1c5waa7,"I understand getting discouraged and like trying new things over and over eventually could feel like a waste of time, especially when you just wanna die anyways where it’s like what’s the point? Hearing ppl speak on what suicidal people should do without having experienced it themselves is pretty frustrating bc they act like they understand when they don’t.I’m sorry you have to go through that. But unfortunately options are limited, it’s either keep trying or just give up, I can’t make you wanna keep trying or undo any discouragement you feel.

Hell not even gonna lie even after all those treatments ts don’t go away completely but it does help ease some of the BPD symptoms, but definitely doesn’t help all symptoms much less cures it, but the help does make it more tolerable to live with.But ofc theirs no one size fits all treatment.

All I can do is give advice and share what helped me, and wish you the best and hope you get through it and find an effective way to cope. I really hope you’re able to find the willpower to push through and find something that works for you and that it gets better for you, hell I didn’t get better till. Just recently. I had given up for awhile and was being a crashout, off meds, in and out of psych wards,Becoming a polyaddict that mixed and took dangerous amounts of substances and deep down hoping it’d kill me, wasting life away, constant Suicide attempts etc. and just overall letting BPD take full reign of me.

But once I finally got my shit together and made that effort to try new things after I had given up for a few years, that’s when I was able to find what works for me. And it’s honestly the best thing I ever done for myself.So I don’t judge or blame you if you for giving up bc I had done the same for a few years but I’m just saying it’s worth it to keep trying bc it doesn’t hurt to keep exploring those options.

1c5waa7,"I am so sorry I thought you were yelling at me😭. But yeah I’m so sorry they only take certain insurances which is fucking stupid like if you don’t have the best insurance they don’t wanna do it. Like if they aren’t able to suck the amount of money that a car would out of you or your insurance then they just act like you don’t deserve treatment. It’s so beyond fucked up. Everyone who needs it deserves treatment regardless of their insurance or financial situation. Fuck the American healthcare system tbh. It’s literally so evil the way it’s set up. 

Without insurance TMS is more expensive than the ket treatments, if you’re gonna save up money to do either I’d suggest the ket bc it’s cheaper and way less sessions. Or even cheaper like I said get shrooms the microdose through the tor browser online. 

Ik I probably sound like a broken record but theirs really limited options already as it is, even more so for you bc your insurance doesn’t wanna cover a lot of stuff.I really hate how limited on options you are.It’s not fair at all. Like our only options outside of pills are crazy expensive inconvenient treatments. 

Or seeking out other drugs to self medicate which is not the best idea especially with someone that had a past with addiction. It would be incredibly difficult to constantly have that level of self control it takes when self medicating while having that addiction trait, ik from experience I personally can’t control myself when it comes to self medication bc my past with drugs. I couldn’t microdose tbh I’d end up bingeing it till it was gone. But that’s just me tho. You may have the willpower that it takes for that. It definitely doesn’t hurt to try the shrooms and see how you handle yourself on them. And how much they help.

1c5waa7,"No need to apologize. I see how my message could be viewed that way. Once I read your reply, I realized that's how you interpreted it.

My insurance said they cover ketamine and ECT. I don't know how I'd get to and from the ketamine treatment two hours away, multiple days a week, so that's essentially out. That just leaves ECT, which... who knows how that will end up working out when they give me more info tomorrow.

I wouldn't be able to do shrooms for the same exact reason. It took me less than two weeks to abuse the Adderall. I was prescribed Vicodin for two different surgeries, at like 17 and 19, and I abused them way back then too. I've always abused anything I could find, regardless of consequences. 

Like I said, I don't know what to do anymore. Nothing fucking works. I'm gonna fucking ***__SNAP__*** one of these days, and I do not know what will happen.

I miss him and I wish I still had him in my life, but he doesn't care enough to reach out or even check if he's still blocked and by all means he shouldn't do those things anyway. So now I'm sad knowing we will never speak again and it's my fault, because I'm assuming he tried to message me during the time he spent blocked and gave up on me.

  
I think the worst is not knowing. He might as well have not tried to message me at all since the day we last spoke and I'm feeling bad over nothing, and I have no way of knowing. Should I even be sad? Did he even try to message me? Or did he proper ghost me? If I hadn't blocked him, I would have known those things.

But other than that, what helped, even though ofc I’m still not fully over them, is recognizing my idolization/idealization of them and writing down the things they did that hurt me. Stop invalidating your feelings to put this person on a pedestal. Coming to the conclusion I don’t need all this drama in my life for some boy (boy in my case). 

- caused obsession and for me to not focus on myself 
- caused rapid mood swings from blissful love to excruciating mental pain 
(More personal coming) 
- said we should “just be friends” after I told him I relapsed self harm and after weeks of reassuring me he wanted a relationship with me 
- disregarded my feelings and even though my reaction was extreme, my feelings WERE VALID 
- played personal voice memos of me speaking privately to him through text to his codependent sister and uncle 
- admitted the reason he decided to break off the blooming relationship was bc he talked with his sister abt it (clearly she controls him) 
- forgave his sister in the past for having sex with his then girlfriend 
- asks his sister for advice all the time despite her being a stoner and 17 years old (he’s abt to turn 20) and can’t hold stable relationships herself 
- coming to the conclusion he and his controlling, manipulative, drug addict, sex addict sister are a package deal
- he’s not emotionally mature enough to deal with me or any relationship until he grows up and recognizes his OWN toxic behavior and codependent relationship with his MINOR sister 

Of course, my list will look VERY different than yours. But, really dig deep into the dynamics you had with your FP and what was seriously wrong with it. Stop putting on the rose tinted glasses, and when you do subconsciously, go back to the list.

1c344ua,"ABSOLUTELY THIS.

I'll try to make this short, but strap tf in, fam.


I had a best friend who cut me out after 20 years. We were closer than siblings, literally had our own language, and could always read each other's mind. They moved away, several places, actually, as they were in the military, but finally settled in a city about 8 hours away. Distance had nothing on us, we were always talking, texting and would even be on the phone together to watch the Victoria's Secret runway show and gush over the outfits. 

Then, about 5 years ago, my whole world got SHOOKETH. I was to be bedridden until my thyroid was in the ""safe zone"" and I could not do literally ANYTHING. It was so bad, just going to the bathroom was grounds for passing out. It took 4 years, and my doctor of over a decade was actually scared when he read the results. ""Idiopathic"" is all over my medical file, because weird shit happens to me, and no one knows why. Literally died when I was 5. No ONE KNOWS WHY. But anyways, he RAN to get me a Synthroid sample, and I couldn't leave until I took it. I told him to just give it to me straight (one of the reasons I love him, he doesn't beat around the bush), how bad was it? He said I wouldn't have lasted the month, which was about 2 ½ weeks. 

YEAH.

ON TOP OF THAT, I was also diagnosed with BPD. idk if it was fate or whatever, but I had nowhere to go, I'm was imnucompromised as all hell, the lock down was about to happen, so, fuck it we ball, I'll do DBT. I'm stuck in bed, I don't want to have this disorder, I want to control these horrible action and reactions. I wanted to heal. So, therapy (and Animal Crossing) became my life. 


So all that happened, and my ex best friend had been already urging me to try therapy, as someone I saw as a mother figure to me was uh...logged out of life by someone else, and I was the next target.(Next year will be 10 years since, so they'd been urging me for awhile, and tbh, I did need it, and I went to one, but...I didn't stick with it. She was a good therapist, just not for me.) So, yeah, therapy was PROBABLY a good idea. Then BPD happened, and they were super supportive, and was happy I was doing DBT to work through a lot. (Extra context: when we were teenagers, we made rules for our friendship. Tbh? We made good, healthy, rules. One that's important in particular, was to not be like the other ""girls."" Not in a QuIrKy way, but to not be vapid, toxic, and actually look at situations/people/etc, and play devil's advocate. No snap decisions. If one of us was acting badly, toxic, etc, it was a TALK. We kept each kept in check; the rule they made specifically. Keep each other in check.)  


Fast forward to about 3ish years ago, and I they're having a rough time being social again as the lock down was being lifted, on top for some friend drama that was ridiculous, really, and they deserved none of what was being thrown at them. It was so childish. But, they had other activities they were trying, and old friend who was the center of one of their hobbies (literally the center. This person could bring back the hobby in full swing for the entire city. That much pull.), and was doing activities with the people around their new hobbies. We didn't talk much, but they were 8 hours away, new hobbies, old friends- I figured they were having fun, some much deserved happiness they needed in their life. I waited, and figured they'd come back and tell me their stories of adventures and so on. 

Joke's on me. I was working on my abandonment issues, and I wanted to text them, but chose not to, because I didn't want to be clingy or anything while they were finally making happy memories. Well, tragedy struck, and it was a PTSD moment for me and my husband, as our elderly cat who was very sick was finally losing the battle. It gave us flashbacks to a past cat we'd lost, which was traumatizing. All I'll say is I've literally never heard my husband scream like that. But here we were, watching it happen again. He lasted through the night, and the next day our other cat was flipping shit while I was on the phone with the vet. When I got off the phone, I went to my other cat, but he took off into the kitchen, came back, and took off into the kitchen again, and I got the hint, and found our cat under the table. Called the vet to cancel our appointment, and wrapped him up.",Burn-the-red-rose,False,1713127992.0

1c344ua,"(Broke character limit, here's the rest!)

So I'm texting them through this whole ordeal, and I'm obviously flipping shit, and they got mad at me. I phrased a question wrong, and 💥.  They said they didn't think it was a big deal, and I didn't tell them how serious it was for them to drop their life for me. They went on to say they were 8 hours away, and I was the retired vet tech, so what could they do? (Keep in mind, they video called me when one of their dogs passed, and I stayed on call with them, and gently coached them through it. Which, I had to switch to vet brain, because I loved that dog as well, they'd had the dog for....13 years? Maybe 15? Ether way, long ass time, so I remained calm and tried to help them when they called.) 

The wrongly phrased question was one word off, and I apologized, as I was dissociating as all hell, but I still phrased it wrong, and I apologized. That turned into a huge fight, and they said some hurtful things, and when I said it was hurtful, deadass, the reply was ""You're not actually hurt, it's just your BPD."" (😐) they would go on to throw some allegations of things I was doing, and I told them I'd no idea, because I didn't. This was an absolute blindside; I'd no idea. 
They said they were tired of ""shrugging off"" my bad behavior, and just thinking it ""just their BPD."" (😐😐) I'm sorry, since tf when did we stop keeping each other in check? Mmk. 

They said that they ""just don't assume anything anymore"" but ""it's not like we're never going to talk again."" Then threw more stuff at me, and my last message of begging to understand is still unread. They were the DEAD LAST person I'd ever want to hurt, and to hear I'd be doing all these horrible allegations, then absolute raido silence and being blocked everywhere, I was in a full tailspin for 7-8 months. I was blindsided, and was in shock for those months, as I did all I could to figure out these allegations. Going back years of past messages, low key stalking their socials, for a hint of literally ANYTHING. I did find some thing in our past messages where I saw my bad behavior, seeing some of the allegations. (I still don't know them all, but I'm in EMDR therapy now, so hopefully I'm getting rid of them.)

One year later of therapy, I sent an apology email. Left the ball in their court, no stings or expectations. Said I'd like to talk, but if they didn't want to, there was zero pressure to do so, but the point of this email was to just apologize for the behaviors I'd figured out, and that's all. Just owning up and apologizing. 

About 2ish months ago, this is the 2nd year, I sent them a text, asking to talk. We didn't have to be friends if they didn't want, but perhaps find a civil ground, or a way to tie up the loose ends and be amicably done with it all. Again, I stated it was up to them, zero pressure, ball in their court. I didn't know if I was blocked by text, and a few hours later, found we were still friends on Discord. So I sent the same message there, with the preface that I'm only sending it here because I didn't know if I was blocked by text. 

The reply. Y'all. First line. ""You didn't consider my feelings!!!!"" 

😐😐😐😐😐😐

From there, they go on to say that because I didn't consider their feelings, there was obviously no way they could even entertain the thought of being in a space to talk to me. They didn't feel safe interacting with me (😐😐😐😐) and, lol, AND, they demanded I stop contacting them until MY THERAPIST COULD VOUCH FOR MY PROGRESS. 

Nail, meet coffin. I waited two years, holding hope we'd talk again, as they said we would, and they assumed nothing changed in two years. The irony isn't lost on me; as they'd said they don't assume and we would talk again. 20 years. I let go. I let go, and after questioning EVERYTHING, never being fully sure of my progress, always terrified I was hurting people, all of it fell off. I could see so clearly, and I could see my progress. I could see how far I'd come, and it was definitely a long way- to the point where I'm in BPD ""remission."" (I know it can come back, but that's a no. I refuse to let it. I know what to do and how to handle it now, and it doesn't stand a chance. Ain't no way in hell I'm letting it come back.) I'm the most mentally stable I've literally ever been in my life, and I can see it all because I let 20 years go.

They just didn't want to spend the extra time teaching. And on one hand I get that sometimes it's easier to just do it. But then that means they still made that decision. 

They weren't there emotionally because their parents weren't. OK. But once again, they're a parent now. If they thought that was a bad thing, they should have tried to take their experience and learn from it. They should have *tried* to be there emotionally.

Following cultural norms. OK. But those cultural norms might have hurt me. Like I'm gay. That cultural norm of homophobia caused me a lot of issues. So why is it that when I came out, they still went with the cultural norm and treated it like it was a horrible thing?

1c31i4b,I mean it depends on the context. A lot of childhood trauma is caused by lack of support from the parents and also from their invalidation etc. if your parent didn’t cause it then ok that’s good but this is literally saying it’s fine for them to be emotionally unavailable and that they did what their parents did and didn’t know better. Eh. No.,kittycakekats,True,1713024981.0
