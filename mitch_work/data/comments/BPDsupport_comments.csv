As far as therapist. If child work isn’t working. Say it.
See if they do t offer up something else. I’m sure u e heard it but the go to is DBT therapy. But for me the best was EMDR.

But you know what? People with BPD are incredibly strong and incredibly empathetic, imagine turning every small situation into a very big, life threatening one and still bouncing back from all this intensity like nothing ever happened? 


You also need to understand that having BPD is not something that you can control, most people with BPD have a lot of childhood trauma that is related to abandonment, so it's not your fault and I know that this may not help a lot , but it's important for you to tell your inner child that it's okay now and that you will be feeling better and getting the help that you and your inner child needed for a long time. 


One last thing about people with BPD, I said that they are incredibly empathetic right? If I didn't have BPD I wouldn't have been able to get through to you and feel what you're feeling and make you feel better, and that is something that normal people don't have , and I'd like to look at it as if it was a super power , because truly we are able to help others and make them feel better about everything.

1ctuiz2,"I’m finally at the diagnosis stage and I feel immense relief, but only because I’ve been a few years in the shame and denial stage. 

My first introduction to the term BPD was when I was looking through my ex-husband’s garage for some of my things and found a book, “Walking on Eggshells: Living with a Borderline.”

I was like…fucking what? It was a bullet to the heart. Especially because he was an alcoholic with his own anger issues and all I ever wanted was to be safe. But also, as borderlines, we have so much empathy, so much that we feel everything, how could *I* be the monster? Because that’s how uninformed society largely views us, monsters.

So I hurt for a while and then denied and then ACCEPTED and started learning. But then I tried discussing it and people told me I didn’t have it because I “wasn’t that bad” (???? Again hurtful to everyone with the disorder) and I realized I was using the potential diagnosis to keep myself exactly how I was.

I wanted to grow and not hide behind a diagnosis of why I was the way I was and couldn’t change. 

But in the last month I found my way back to the diagnosis. I’m coming back to life after chemotherapy and my meltdowns (as I call them) have been very frequent. Feelings of emptiness that won’t go away. I’m doing everything I can over here. I’ve got my meeting with therapists next month and I’d like to tell
you why, after all this time and all these years, this diagnosis is a relief:

There’s a reason for my constant emptiness and extreme empathy. It’s not just inherently who I am as a person. I was hurt. I get to say what happened to me as a child isn’t fair and wasn’t my fault.

I can finally, finally, after years of therapy, find a therapist who can HELP ME. it’s been so frustrating going to therapy and not having someone understand or suggest tools for someone without the disorder. I remember telling my fiancé, “no matter what I do, goals set accomplished etc., I always end up back here in this pit of self-loathing and emptiness.”

I get to work on self-esteem, identity, and not just repeat positive mantras in a mirror while every mirror-neuron on my body screams for death because I saw a rough news story. 

I’ve done incredible things in my life, I beat cancer, this year, and I wondered how the hell I could
Still be so upset about little things. 

The shame hasn’t been removed, but layers and layers have been torn away for me. I get to really heal!! I’ve been sitting in pain for my whole life, as have we all. We can do this. 

And also, love is possible. My fiancé loved me as I was. He’s the most patient understanding person. Even if he never understands why I get so upset, he’s told me that he loves me because I’m a good person, and that he sees how upset I get and is kind of amazed at how well and frequently I’m able to bounce back from such massive upsets. He says I just need time to feel my feelings. I don’t know how the hell I found him but he’s real. And I’m going to practice the intense love I feel in my heart by finding ways to heal. 

Because……BPD IS NOT A LIFE SENTENCE. We can heal. We will. It’s in our very nature to heal, to dive down under the muck and look under every rock. 

We just need the right tools. And society is becoming more and more trauma informed. 

We get told we need to love ourselves and practice self-compassion. What non-bpd people
Don’t realize is that WE DONT KNOW WHO THAT SELF IS, and we have mega trust issues. 

I learned recently that shame and guilt are something we can let go. A diagnosis hurts because we have this internal talk that constantly tells us we’re horrible people, and the diagnosis is like a big light that says, “you are!” But we’re not. A diagnosis means you have symptoms and behaviors indicative of someone who was very hurt, probably when very little, and developed these tendencies to survive.

1ctuiz2,"Hi, thank you for your response. One thing I strive for is to be as honest as I possibly can. I’ve done mountains of research and reading about my disorders, and from what I’ve learned about BPD, it is definitely possible to recover from BPD.  I’ll include a link to the national library of medicine below if you’re interested.

However, I do believe that sometimes the language surrounding mental health and recovery can be a bit ambiguous, which doesn’t do well our BPD black and white thinking tendencies.

I do agree with you that we will always always feel the way we feel. We will always have triggers and huge emotions and many, many other things. But we can also develop tools to allow us to manage these things. 

I believe that’s why mental health and addiction use the word “recovery” instead of “cure.”

I’m an alcoholic in recovery. I haven’t had a drink in two and a half years and the obsession to drink has been removed. But am I cured? Hell no.

I’m one drink away from the same cycle, always. What’s different is I have tools now instead of just drinking to numb myself. 

With BPD, I also have tools now and I hope to develop many, many more. For example, when I would dissociate, I found that human touch helped me. I told my fiancé that when I’m having a meltdown, I need him to gently hold my hand. I don’t run away anymore, even though every cell in my body screams for me to run. That’s improvement. 

I still get massive intrusive thoughts out in public. I cry through them and center myself and resume activity. Self soothing techniques can be learned.

I understand, through tons of exploration, that I am extremely unsure of relationships and explain my fear of abandonment to people I’m close to. I tell them I need reassurance. 

And sometimes the world shits all over my safe little bubble of awareness and is just mean. I allow myself to be myself and hurt. It hurts, I know you hurt. 

But to say recovery isn’t possible for us seems against our very nature. We are resilient. How many people do you know that could overcome several massive core- shattering episodes A DAY, and still take another step forward?  There is no way we can just feel all the massive amounts of empathy we feel and NOT take action. I’ll bet you’re one of the kindest people I could ever know. Maybe you never miss a sending a birthday card or compliment an old lady on her perfume and really mean it. 

We are the way we are. But we can learn do modify our behaviors, which are a set of patterns of reactions. Life is always going to life. Please try not to get stuck under your diagnosis. 

And if that’s how you feel, my friend, that’s how you feel. But I encourage you, perhaps not now but in a moment of darkness, to consider what opportunities for growth and creation your destruction has brought into the world.",ImpressiveSell5404,False,1716050507.0

I think the most obvious signs were the self harming, extreme fear of abandonment, and feeling empty. I used to tell my mom I felt empty constantly.

I went to tons of counsellors and doctors, and when I was 15 we finally talked to a psychiatrist after my GP said she had suspicions that I was Bipolar. Turns out I am, didn’t know you could have both. 

Unfortunately the psychiatrist just bulldozed me the entire appointment. I barely spoke three sentences to him while he lectured my family and I about hormones and sleep. It was awful. 

I just tried to live with it because I felt like I’d never get a diagnosis after my experience.  When I was 18 my mom and I decided to try again because the symptoms were getting worse. That’s when I was diagnosed.

While I do see my relationship in certain parts of the trauma bonding, like love bombing and then pulling away, I’m pretty sure he doesn’t do it on purpose. I don’t think he’s a narcissist because his behaviors are not calculated, he doesn’t actively try to put me down. He also feels a lot of guilt and hasn’t tried to blame me for his behaviors after he’s come down from his anger. He does realize his behaviors can be abusive and he does seemingly feel really guilty about it.

His issue is just that he gets extremely angry and can’t control it. Do I believe he 100% respects me in general? No, I don’t. Is he selfish? Yes, yes he is. But he doesn’t do it to hurt me I’m pretty sure it’s his past trauma giving him a sort of avoidant personality. He has lied to me multiple times before about a specific matter until I set my foot down and almost left him, then he stopped lying about it. Is that a red flag? Yes ofc it is, but it’s much more complicated than that I think.

Are some of the things he does abusive?

Extra Info For You: 

General consensus is also that CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) doesn't work well for autistic patients. One reason is the alexithymia. Alexithymia has to do with trouble identifying own emotions and or trouble with identifying the emotions in other people. 

For autistic patients, DBT is more known to help in order to work through trauma and or other distressing problems.

1cnw8ca,"Self-harming thoughts can be part of a) autism and or b) mental health challenges. 
I can't say it's normal to do or think this or that. 
However, it's possible to look at certain things and compare them to thinking patterns, behaviors and emotional responses of a very big group of people.

Autism alone can be a big part of feeling very very uncomfortable in the own body. It's like overwhelming internal sensory sensations traveling throughout the body and the only thing one can think of is how to stop it no matter how drastic. 

So, out of the viewpoint of an autistic person, intrusive thoughts could be more common and thus more ""normal"". Normal in itself is a weird concept because it's based on the average distribution of specific characteristics in society. So if the majority acts a certain way, it becomes a norm. Statistically speaking, anyone acting differently than the average person becomes an outlier. It is then deviating from the norm. That's what behind psychology questionnaires ,comparing data with a) people in similar situations & b) people without the issues a patient is dealing with. 

It also means that whatever someone tells you in regards to your self-harming intrusive thoughts might be an outlier themselves aka can't make a good judgement. 
There is also a difference between accepting someone with their issues but being aware things should be a tad different and downplaying / not realizing how bad someone's else's trouble is.",lostinspace80s,False,1715353844.0

Your partner deserves bodily autonomy. There are many reasons why he may have wanting his first time after surgery to be alone. All of those reasons are valid. I’m sorry you felt hurt by this, but we should respect his body and space. 
Please take some time to consider the responses you’ve received on this post. I would recommend trying to pause before you react to allow yourself time to think about what is triggering an emotional response. Process your feelings then try to discuss them in a kind, respectful way. You cannot manipulate or guilt him over sex.

He isn’t a saint, he’s an abuser and has put his hands on me and lied about it. I think what causes us to act crazy is we feel that we have simply been done dirty all our life and the only thing that makes sense to do is be angry. I did what I needed to do to leave the relationship, the anxiety I delt with in the relationship is still there but I’m no longer projecting it onto another person. What we have to realize is that those who we connect to have a massive influence on us. We sense things differently and we are more aware of others and their wrong doings. You must come to terms with the fact that you and your partner connection has ended. You have to face the reality of being alone until you can get the healing for the inner core that is broken. I don’t know your exact situation and my thoughts are with you I understand what it is to act out of character due to someone else’s wrongdoings. What helped me leave was meditation and imagining someone who I did feel safe with. Those things matter so much because I feel alone in this world and unsafe around mostly everyone. Your son is your answer. Look through guidance through him. I know a simple I love you from him is a miracle. You have to leave the relationship that is causing you pain. Yes some of your actions towards him were never good, but if someone is constantly pushing your boundaries and seeking pain or reaction out of you, you’re still better than that. Even with BPD, people think because I act bipolar or angry that I don’t know what’s best for me still, that’s a lie. You know deep in your heart what is best. I know what it’s like to wake up and just start hating your partner and yourself and self harming because of that. Think about things you can also change in your environment. Even if it’s small, you should treat yourself. Do not give up. The loop others put us and the cycle of pain and depression others can cause is something they just won’t understand, think of a few skills you have and focus on those. Take the time you need.

A partner should be receptive to you and be emotionally supportive. Calling you names, them blocking you, them stonewalling you is not supportive of your needs for security and safety and reliability.
It's not nurturing and it's toxic. 

Your partner not being able to stand up for their boundaries in mature matter (e.g. communicating better how much contact is ok and how much is too much) is detrimental. It's a vicious cycle. 

It's a difference between BPD overtaking you and reacting in the way you do and his outright malicious manipulation like lying to you about the ""mistaken phone turning off with blocking"". He doesn't show an understanding of what you are going through internally and holds it against you.

1ckn7ae,"Hi! I am currently dealing with the aftermath of a break up myself and a possible reconciliation. 

The break up is the result of his splitting and me not understanding what has been going on, why he thinks the way he thinks. My relationship was mirroring your situation until push came to shove and I couldn't make sense of it all anymore and couldn't see his love for me anymore during his last split. 

I am AuDHD and he has strong traits for BPD. I realized yesterday that he most likely has undiagnosed BPD and that everything he says and does when feeling safe and secure is meant true from his heart. That his love is true and deep. 
However, I let him know that I am finally beginning to understand everything, the big picture and all. And that I forgive him. And that I will be there for him. 
But it's hard for him to see the love I have for him. 
It's hard for him to trust me due to trauma from childhood. I let him know I want us to be ok again, that I want to find a way to continue our relationship. He wanted to see me spontaneously yesterday after breaking up with me earlier this week and I couldn't (parental obligations, I couldn't go meet him, and still under shock myself, processing it all emotionally). He sent me FB request when I was asleep, and I didn't have a chance to see it because he deleted it. Thinking I ignored it. Today, he says we both broke up when I said I want to see him again. When I said I don't want to break up so many times, it still didn't get through to him. I still let him know today that I hope we can be together again. I never wanted to break up. 


He didn't ask me to read about BPD. I did. Because I love him. But I also would have read about it if he gave me links and books about it. Because as an autistic woman I need to collect fragments to be able to see the bigger picture and to be able to make sense of how someone behaves. It took me until Friday night to connect the dots. To see what he is dealing with himself. To see when he gets mean due to fear of abandonment it's BPD speaking, not him. It took me 9 months to see it.

Because then you two have a chance to talk about it and get ideas what aspect to talk about. It's good to hear about other people's experiences, it's like collecting scientific evidence or data that what you say and how you think and act is actually true and makes sense because it's confirmed by others who go through splitting and all. It's helping because it helps shift the perspective on things in a good way. At least that's how it works out for me, with reconciliation on the horizon and a positive outlook. It's easier to look at what others experience with the same condition or neurotype because there is no emotional attachment that could alter the perception. PS my special person has it in common too with you regarding sensory overload and energy depletion from socializing. I assume for BPD people being drained from socializing is from the constant fear of rejection and trying to make everyone happy even if it goes against own needs? Whereas for ASD people it's due to having to process all small fragments of interactions and such that flood the brain unfiltered. Different reason, similar outcome.

 I can share my story of how I broke up with my girlfriend, maybe this will help you understand something.

I announced that we were stopping dating (however, we had had quarrels before that, which provided the prerequisites for such an outcome). 
At the moment of the breakup, I was driven more by emotions rather than logic, however, there was also an understanding that we were hurting each other and that I'm dependent on my partner. 
Only after a significant time after the relationship did I realize that I had an addiction to my partner and that she was tired of my excessive attention and sometimes wanted to get rid of me, which I misinterpreted and I thought that they hated me.

It took me a very long time to forget her (about 3 years). Sometimes it’s difficult for me to understand my emotions and I don’t know if it could be called love or if it was an addiction. sometimes I was incredibly happy in the relationship, and sometimes it hurt me very much and in one case almost led me to suicide.

For me, this all left a significant imprint and as a result, I decided not to start a relationship. I understand that relationships can give me happiness and support, but they can also cause me a lot of pain.

1chl2vb,"I broke up with my FP when they made it clear they were not interested in long distance and therefore a long term future with me. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done but it remains the best decision I have ever made, the choice I’m proudest of.

I know how hard it is to gain perspective because of how all-consuming a relationship with a FP feels. Since the breakup with my FP, I have realized that they treated me badly, blamed me for things that were beyond my control, and were indifferent to the pain they caused me. I put up with all of it because I couldn’t accept that someone who I admired so much was flawed and taking advantage of the fact that I would do anything for them.

It sounds like your FP treats you terribly, way worse than mine ever did, and I really hope you find a way out of this relationship. It will do wonders for your sense of dignity and self-respect if you cut ties and stand your ground. No one deserves to be cheated on or strung along as you have been. Your mind is probably racing to justify how you can stay together, but it seems like this relationship has been over for a long time. Personally it seemed impossible that I would have the strength to cut my FP off for good until I did it. I believe you can do it too!!",trappercomplex,False,1714592322.0
1chl2vb,"https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ezzdmo/how_i_got_through_my_devastating_breakup/  

And this post helped me so much through the first couple of months post-breakup. I had a hard time conveying how intensely leaving my FP affected me to my non-BPD friends and family, but the fact that OP seemed to experience a similar level of intensity made me feel less alone. 

Also little hope for the future, maybe:  I still struggle with BPD symptoms but I manage them much better now with my therapist and DBT skills.  

My ex is no longer my FP, which seemed impossible at the time of the breakup. I have a beautiful boyfriend, who has only ever had kind words for me and who makes it clear every day that I am his top priority. My boyfriend is also not my FP — I have occasional flare-up obsessions with people, but the solidity of my relationship helps to keep those episodes short and I’m not as tempted to interact with those people and descend into full-blown FP territory as I was in the past. I have fulfilling, balanced relationships with the people in my life and I don’t feel powerless over them like I used to. 

Sorry for writing so much but I really relate to your situation and I want you to know that it really can get so much better. I understand the hopelessness and desperation you are probably feeling right now. Just know that you are worth more than what you’re being treated as.

Only a professional could give you a diagnosis, and they will only test the patient, in person. 


Since you don't want advice but an opinion, here are my 2 cents: you're both very young and immature, insecure, and both of you are toxic to the point of being psycologically and physically violent. 


While he might have his own issues and insecurities, he appears to be the sane one in this relationship. He tried to get out several times. He tried ghosting you, blocking you, tried to leave your house several times, tried to cut ties and even found another girl. His message was pretty clear imo. You, on the other hand, sound manipulative as hell. You can't understand that it's over, you physically restrain him while he is trying to get some space, you hit him, you threaten suicide and call the cops on him, get him charged for a criminal offense, and so on. 


I've seen such levels of toxicity and manipulation in relationships but rarely all in the same one. 


In my humble opinion: 
- Guy forgets about our date. 
- He then tells me that he is entitled to sex because he spent 200 dollars. 
- He breaks up with me over chlamydia.
- He breaks up with me over alleged insecurities.
- Cheats on me
- Ghosts me
- Etc.


The list goes on and personnally, would have cut ties at the 200 dollars comment. Staying after that is masochism. 


Just like you, I have very low self-esteem and extreme fear of abandonment. I've been toxic in a couple of relationships when I was younger, lots of physical and psychological abuse. But when they want to leave, I let them leave. 


Point is, you are still young. One day you will come to the same conclusion all women who came before you did:
       
       We cannot fix them. 


Once you understand that it's not your role, place, and that it simply cannot be done, you will free yourself of toxic relationships. 



Once you realize that trying to fix someone is a sign that you are trying to fix yourself, you will be able to start working on your problems in therapy.


Good luck OP. ",CherryPickerKill,False,1714876939.0

1cfcaxu,"I wouldn't call the person sane crying over fictional cheating, I wouldn't call the person sane starting physical violence over stupid comment about someone else's dick. Yes you're right he tried to leave before, but it was an excuse for him to avoid his own issues. And yet still after first breakup he was texting me 24/7 telling me how much he loved me and missed me. After getting back together he said that for him I was his girlfriend in his mind through whole break up, and I felt the same.

I hit him only after he grabbed my shoulders and threw me twice, first on the wall then to the floor. I told the police all the circumstances and they told me it's a self defense, I admitted to them them I wanted to hit him so he would get back to his sanity, they still considered it as self defense. I have huge abandonment issues controling me in situations like this. We had a similar fight before, but when he saw how wounded I was he promised to never treat me in that way again. If he had the strength to grab my body and throw it around he could have just pushed me away, and run out the door, but he preferred to hit me with his all strength, throw me to broken glass afterwards and strangle me.

  
Whether I'm manipulative or not, I didn't threaten to kill myself by blackmailing him. I really felt like this and asked for help. One time when I ended up in hospital I didn't even tell anyone, so this time I believed him as my boyfriend would help me when I felt at my lowest. I called he police only because i couldn't afford the doctor and i was deaf on my ear after what he did, and they eventually put me in hospital due to my suicidal urges. How is saying that I would call the police a threat? If i was healthy i would have done it without even talking to him. You can't compare a slap in the cheek by a weak girl like me to throwing, hitting and strangling by strong ass man. He could have called the police during our fight telling that I dont want to let him go, before starting physical abuse, they would just put me in hospital and it wouldn't have escalated like this.



He didn't find another girl, after breaking up I know he hooks up with randoms, and the girl he cheated on with is a girl he was seeing for few months before dating me. And when I spoke to her she admitted she wanted to be his girlfriend but he refused and said he didn't want one. But between me and him, he asked me first to be with me. I know I really mattered to him, whether in healthy or unhealthy way, I was all he cared about. So I know it was just a coping mechanism to kill loneliness and get validation.



I'm not asking for analysis to fix him. I'm not talking to him anymore. I just need to understand things for myself. And yeah you're right, you listed all the red flags, and I ignored them. This is something I'm working on with my therapist, the reason why I always end up in same unhealthy patterns.



And you're lucky if accepting that you can't fix others helped you. I've been aware of that for long time yet still I keep finding myself in toxic relationships time after time. I left my home country due to being in abusive relationship breaking up and coming back 9 times. In last year I lived on 3 different continents. I went to 2 therapies since the time I decided to leave my ex ex. I know I have my flaws, I'm aware of them trying to fix myself.



I just wanted to know what might be the inner struggles that cause my last ex to behave this way.

Good luck to you as well",best_pussy_disorder,True,1714879076.0
1cfcaxu,"I've on 3 continents as well, 5 countries. Did the same in all of them, nothing really changes. 


After a few abusive relationships, which eroded my already low self-esteem, I started to really wonder if I was the problem and it was me that was making them abusive. This is even worse of a spiral. Therapy or support groups have been a life-saver for that.  


I needed to understand why I always seemed to attract them, and why my self-esteem was so low that I would voluntarily stay and withstand abuse even when it was clear that my life was in danger. That was achieved in therapy as well. 


For my own safety, I also needed to learn about red flags, how to spot abusers, and understand why they acted that way. The book that gave me the most insight was written by Lundy Bancroft, who was in charge of rehabilitation groups for abusers sent by law enforcement. Title is ""Why does he do that?"".


If you want to know what really goes on in an abuser's mind, Bancroft has seen it all and explains it perfectly.


As for the need to fix someone, I know that simply knowing it won't solve the bad relationship choices. Staying single for a while worked for me, so does redirecting this need to rescue to something else. In my case street dogs.

I'm glad that you have a good support system. I'm quiet BPD too and it's not easy. Nobody even remotely understands us and there's such a strong stigma.


Would you say your suicidal thoughts appeared around the time you got your diagnosis? It happened to me with autism and it was (is) horrible. 


When it reaches that point, I generally don't involve my close social circle, I ask the psychiatrist for an emergency meeting (sucidal ideation can be a side effect of the treatments) so that they can readjust, and of course request an emergency session with my therapist. I'm not sure what yours have you on at the moment but sometimes a small increase in dosage or adding a new molecule has been a life saver for me.

1c6ks6j,"HELLO ALL! I have SUCCESS! 
I have successfully completed many years with my partner. Open genuine communication/updates, therapy for both parties, a collaborative approach and willingness to work together and on your own. Both parties taking accountability and responsibility for their own actions and self, daily! Scribbling down all the active thoughts, good or bad, whenever I feel the BPD acting out helps A LOT. It gives somewhere for the inner information that is overwhelming somewhere else to go. It releases you and helps you start to understand and reflect. This has been a large part of my own personal growth and healing. It has helped me not destroy myself or relationships with others in the hardest times of the BPD.

Giving the other party of the relationship tools, resources and action plans for BPD triggers and episodes is a necessity. It’s also important that they are ALSO taking care of themselves and maintaining self care, too. Someone else has no idea what to do or how you feel if you don’t give them the tools or if you don’t let them in and tell them. Ultimately there has to be shared connected trust. Trust can be built, if you struggle with that because of trauma. Therapy. Therapy. Therapy. DBT therapy, EMDR therapy & trauma informed care/therapy has helped me change my life. However, you must actively continually seek out the growth and do that work! It truly helps bring the light back to your life!🤍 Of course life is not perfect, however taking care of these things has allowed me to live a life and have a real relationship that I did not think was possible.🤍
Big difference between good and bad times is working hard on myself and doing the work EVEN when it’s hard. Working through it will help, ignoring BPD only allows it to take over your life and relationships.
Sending all the love and positivity to you lovelies!

1c6ks6j,"I’m someone with “quiet” BPD. My husband and I have a wonderful relationship - married 7 years now!

We met in high school and it was ROUGH. I was undiagnosed and unmedicated and that was a lot for 2 sixteen year olds. Over the years we’d break up, get back together, break up, go no contact and eventually both got into different long term relationships. 

When we were both single again I decided why not try and “ran” into him and it went so well we eventually got married. What made that time different was def that I knew the beast inside me this time. I understood my condition better, I was on the right medication and have done SO SO much therapy. DBT saved my life. He did his own research, spoke with his own therapist and even went to a few sessions with me in DBT.  He knows I am not my mental illness which was really important to me. 

With all that said I think it also helps that he can tell when I’m having a bpd moment and will call it straight out. Weirdly that helps bring me back down to earth?

1c63vle,"short answer: extremely open and frequent conversations about behaviors, a little bit of grace and maturity. 

long answer: I was diagnosed with BPD at 19, but it's been suspected since 16. now I'm married, in a ""normal"" healthy relationship. I no longer meet the DSM 5 requirements. I'm not going to pretend that I don't still really struggle at times, because I do. 

what has helped me the absolute most, is that my husband is smart, and a logical thinker. I entered our relationship telling him that I have BPD, he looked up unbiased information about BPD, read a few studies, joined a Facebook group I was in so he could see how other people with BPD act and feel. another thing in the same vein as seeing and hearing about how people with BPD act, he would come to therapy with me! he actually suggested multiple times ""maybe we should bring this up on your next session?"" or ""could you schedule a session, you're not doing well."" and as hard as that is to hear, if you force yourself through that anger and sadness, and go to the session or make an earlier appointment, you tend to see more results. as people with BPD, we don't normally feel outside of this very moment, so you gotta strike while the iron is hot and what not. 

another thing is being held accountable for your reactions, but not necessarily your thoughts. the way you react to thoughts are solely your responsibility, but the reason why you had the thought in the first place isn't on you. example: early in the relationship I had a flashback to how my ex abused me, and the way I reacted towards him wasn't okay. at the end of the day my husband isn't my abusive ex boyfriend. we can see how that connection is logical, but they have no idea. this is where a little grace comes in. your partner has to be a little lenient ""yes the way you acted wasn't okay, but we talked through it now. I understand a bit better now. next time xyz."" for me personally, making plans on how to do something makes me think about it a lot, it gets ingrained in my head and then when a situation like that happens again, it's one of my first thoughts. 

my last tip that I tell everyone, even if they don't have BPD, is to not ask questions you want a genuine answer to. what if the answer is hurtful, you set yourself up. what if the answer isn't as good as you scripted, you set up those expectations. I'm talking about questions like do you think this person is pretty, what was your first impression of me, what would you do if I died, etc. yes the answer of those are sweet and give us satisfaction but more likely than not you already know what you want the answer to be. you want them to say no that person isn't cute because 9/10 it's someone who looks the exact opposite of you, but you want them to say yes so you have a reason to split. 

it takes a lot from both people. I've spent plenty number of nights sobbing in my husband's lap because he wouldn't let me react the way I normally do, and it feels like a genuine pain, I'm having to sit with those thoughts and feel through them instead of splitting and avoiding the feeling altogether. he has spent many hours secretly upset with my reaction and waiting for me to calm down so he can get reassurance that I still love him. there's going to be fuck ups. you're going to have your feeling hurts, so will your partners. there's going to be days where you feel like you haven't gotten any better but your partner has seen amazing improvement and is so proud of you. just for the love of everything holy, talk to each other. if there needs to be a code word you use as that fire starts, so that you can walk away from the conversation until you're better, so be it! I use the word pomegranate. this is possible and I wish you nothing but luck. I hope you show yourself a little grace in this process as well. no one else could ever imagine how having a disorder that feels like second degree burns over most of your body feels.",kaprioara,False,1713412910.0

I emailed my therapist about what I am feeling and that I know I’m being “inappropriate” and I don’t want to actually do anything that would jeopardise therapy but I felt I needed to be honest about my confusing feelings 

He was really understanding. He was very proud of me for emailing because he knows how hard it must have been to do that. I had a session on Thursday with him and I was so nervous but honestly it helped! 

He explained that the nature of the therapy that we’re doing (image rescripting where I insert him into a bad memory and he protects me until my “adult self” learns how to) can bring up all sorts of feelings and emotions and it was really helpful to look at it biologically 

Nothing was off, no boundaries crossed, I told him I am scared to ever leave therapy because I don’t ever want to be without him, I said a lot of things that I really realised are my abandonment issues and not about him specifically. We spoke about my issues with men and people pleasing and being scared of rejection. It all makes so much sense why I feel this way about him!

Like you’re going there but really just to fawn around him probably. You’re distracted from your mission. Plus if you’re not getting treatment the way you should then you’re likely to fuck up anything with him. Lets see how you can best play your cards here. 

I say you switch therapists and on your way out (last session maybe) you can tell him it’s because you have a crush on him. That way, its either mortifyingly embarrassing because he rejects you and then you never have to see him again OR the universe pulls a wild card and he gives you the green light BECAUSE you are no longer gonna be a patient. He would only ever take you up on this if you werent a patient. If you tell him while you’re a patient, he may refer you to go to someone else and you may feel too broken to be proactive about finding a new therapist.

1c2wvmw,"Don't start relationships with mentally ill, romantically taken women..... Sorry bud, this is a situation where *you* should have drawn a boundary and kept it *just sex*. She can have intense, temporary feelings as anyone in a romanceship can and especially someone with BPD, and her husband is the one enabling this, so you needed to use him as your true North. Unless he's sitting there actively participating or personally inviting you to become part of the relationship, ""every iteration"" is trespassing. Either she's in a toxic BPD relationship and her partner has his own set of stress, or they've got a functional open relationship *and you should, at the very fucking least out of respect for the opportunity you've been given, never try to come between the original pair*. People can get extremely fierce defending their territory, and I'm not talking about him there - that could very well mean she's caught feelings for you which conflict with her stronger and more established feelings for her husband and she's gotta burn you down because you're a threat. Besides that, it's scummy. 

As to the complex, you may not be the a-team that you think or she may just be projecting. I bet if you cut it off, as you bloody well should, then there won't be further commentary. There's no need for her to explain and if you're not looking for answers or pressing to solve problems and such, she'll have no excuse be toxic towards you. If you walking away offends her ego and she tries to come back, don't even leave the door open to conversation. She'll burn down her whole world just to ""win"", and for nothing - it'll *never* be good again between you two if it goes to that length. 

Move on. Sex is always better at the beginning and a couple of rebounds will help your ego; hopefully this experience will patch up some holes in your common sense and decency, too. 

Sorry for being direct, this is just a whole bucket of bad decisions you've made and you need to know that you need to be the one to fix it by walking away. 

And again, as someone with extensive swing experience, *never* come between the original pair. Be thankful *they* have allowed you to have some fun, respect common sense boundaries even if the heat of the moment makes it seem like they're not there, and don't get caught letting yourself think it's more than it is.

I think some practitioners simply have a preconceived set of notions that they attempt to make anyone they see fit into.  They can be downright dangerous to any patients caught in their nets.

1bynsn2,"I'm sorry to be the dark cloud here, I'm all for BPD recovery and hope but reading your intro sounds like you're either a pretty intense case or early on in the recovery process. I dated a girl like this, *beginning* in college, and it destroyed my life on multiple levels. Ultimately I'm responsible for staying in the relationship, but... If you're not ready, if you're not able to control your actions and keep your emotions in check, don't be that person that lets others suffer so that you can practice. Your feelings aren't bad, but they're also not appropriate as you've noted. This early on in the relationship, these are red flags that should indicate that you ought to spare him and yourself the pain (if he falls for you, there's a codependency that tends to develop with BPD relationships and it will fundamentally alter him and not for the better; if he doesn't fall that hard then you're setting yourself up for rejection). If it first came up later on then you could say ""well this is unexpected but we're already invested and want to work it out,"" but at this point, cut your losses and go work on yourself. 

>I hate these ppl, and I want them to suffer uncontrollably 

The ex I mentioned, she was like this but very subtly. I only figured it out years later when I'd repeatedly lost, rebuilt, and lost everything again repeatedly. I know her, *very* well, and there's no part of me that thinks she's a bad person... Just more interested in her needs than those of others and anchored in her dreams than the reality of her actions and situation. The medication and therapy that she started years later, I wish they'd happened sooner, and that I'd not sacrificed nearly a decade of my life, personal development, and psychological well being to her illness. We haven't spoken in years and she's doing better now it seems, as am I, but I'll never get back that time. I resent her deeply.

On the flip side, I'm again with someone who has BPD but this woman is oriented towards change and improvement and, though there are relapses, she's made tremendous strides forward and I'm not boxed in at all. She recognizes her toxic behaviors very quickly, sometimes immediately, and strives to reign them in, while also making consistent efforts to control her thoughts rather than letting them control her. She no longer really meets BPD criteria, but that's been a combo of therapy, medication, personal effort and if I may toot my own horn, a good support network (I have former professional experience and we had a unique situation where we were able to stay home with eachother for a long time during which we worked on a lot of her issues by noticing and addressing even the finest details, subtleties and shifts). Accountability is *huge*,...uncomfortable, scary and even painful at times, but a truly tremendous component of the [her] process.

As far as he goes, he sounds like a young college guy, not ready for an *average* adult relationship anyway... But you can only work with that which *you* can control. Either his behavior, if he's keeping everything above board in the first place, is acceptable or unacceptable to you. What you can do with that is decide *your* course of action, not the course that you *want* him to take, and you should decide this based on considerate and long term factors, not just how bad you're feeling and what you're attributing that feeling to at the moment - ie logic over fear and pain reactions, even if it yields the less comfortable result.

Me and my bf fight but i’ll bite through my tongue before I say “SAY THE FUCK UP” when my brain tells me to. If you are borderline you are hardwired to attack when vulnerable and so it must be a priority that you are hyper-conscious of your malicious default settings when having emotional conversations with loved ones. It doesn’t sound like he cares at all, maybe if he didn’t make those comments belittling your feelings I could scrap some advice together but if he can change he wont do it for a long time and it wont be for you, I think. You can try setting a harsh ass boundary and never coming back from it… personally I snap and get immediately as mean if im confronted with this but you’re not borderline so I dont know what to tell you to do cause I dont want you to like.. pick up bad behavior? Just tell him you’re gonna leave him if he ever talks to you like you’re a piece of shit again. I had to tell myself that if I’m gonna act like I hate someone’s presence 90% of the time then I can’t expect them to care about my abandonment issues, regardless of what I feel behind my behavior.

Do you have any hobbies or interests you started doing less after being in that relationship? Force yourself to do them! Even if it’s just for 5 minutes. It’s really great you’re going to therapy that’s the perfect outlet. Write things in your notes, texts you won’t send. Rearrange your room!!!

- drink something hot 
- shower
- listen to music
- clean something

It’s going to be excruciating and I wish there was a way any of us could save you from that but unfortunately that’s life and that’s particularly life with BPD. Here’s the good news: you will be ok. It’s been almost a year and I won’t lie, it still hurts sometimes but it’s far and few between and I have new people in my life who are absolutely amazing. If you ever need someone to talk to who understands, my messages are always open. Hang in there, I promise you it’ll get brighter again ❤️

1. Shooting games (any game where you’re supposed to “win” a battle should work)

2. Contact sports/Competitive games

3. Sports/Activities in general to exhaust dopamine (I rollerblade)

4. Looking online for FUCKED UP things that have happened and joining in on movements to correct them  (Example; a black middle schooler was severely assaulted two years ago in the midwest and the school took no disciplinary action towards the aggressors, the family asked for help with contacting the school so I joined in with others to write emails to the school demanding a swift correction of their actions. Stuff like that) 

5. DIY rage room. I used to buy 20 yr old box tvs from goodwill for like $6 and pummel them with an axe in a junkyard or abandoned building where there’s already tons of contained trash. 
(The side of my throat got cut by ricochet glass once so maybe wear some sort of safety equipment) 

6. Target shooting (Can be firearms but Ive been to axe throwing + archery places and that works as well)

Picturing a goal image of the result for how I wanted a room to look was also a motivator for me. Organizing things almost became like an art project in a strange sense.

When I lived with a partner in the past many years back, there came a point where they also fell into the “parent” and “all the cleaning alone” role and I wasn’t really picking up the slack. Eventually the guilt started to weigh with me, and it was embarassing when guests came over and I could not claim that I had cleaned any of my apartment, that the partner did all the work. I felt the pressure of being a lousy person for that. To be honest however, once we became long distance is when I really started my first large efforts in keeping my space somewhat clean and not overly cluttered for my own mental health. Also being able to say I cleaned or organized something on my own was pretty empowering. Not burdening my partner also made me feel better. It was not an easy habit to break initially though. Once ways are set it’s tough to change, but it is not impossible. 

Keep in mind that over burdening someone with tasks instead of balancing your share can put a huge unspoken strain on a relationship, which can and will take its toll in the long run. If it matters, you will want to put as much mental force into fixing this as you can, and not wait for a point of no return in regards to how things will last this way. I’m sorry if that’s scary, but it also a reality that needs to be considered. 

The most recent time I ran into this problem was last year with a different partner I did not live with. However, this time I was admant that my disorganized room was my problem and diswayed them from cleaning for me to avoid old habits. Unfortunately since this was not a shared space and it was my room, it stayed pretty messy until after we broke up. That weirdly gave me the motivation to fix it all myself again, on top of having friends start to come over. My room now looks like an instagram-ready bedroom with all the lights and decor I added since I had the funds for it. This ex learned of it later and was impressed and pretty proud of me!  I’ve maintained it for many months since. I guess a good motivator in this case was getting to implement aesthetics I enjoyed, so maybe that might help you as well?

1bteb6r,"Hey I’ve been exactly where you are. My BPD was so severely attached to my abusive ex boyfriend. After I left the relationship the second time he did the same. 

TRIGGER WARNING : DIRECT MESSAGE 

“Hopeless friendless broke no school no job, a family that hates you, a guilt that that kills you, no inherent value that you see yourself causing you to f*** the most trash and ugly people cause that’s the best you can do” 

I had just been disowned by my family after my first attempt (he broke up with me 2 weeks after my attempt cause I was “asking for too much”, AKA general reassurance cause he was out with the girl he had been cheating on me with throughout the relationship). 
Favourite people are hard to deal with cause detaching from them is irrational. He continued to be my fp until I returned to my original city and met with him again. I had just gotten out of another relationship and was insanely low so reached out. Seeing him again sealed it for me. 
Growing into a person he didn’t recognize confirmed that he was in my past forever. When we met I was afraid I would regress into the patterns I held before but seeing that he had not changed in the slightest (even getting worse in areas) confirmed that no, I can’t and refuse be treated that was again. 
This being said I was the exact same as you. He had a new gf like 2 weeks after me and was plastering her everywhere (not to mention the more personal, not NSFW, photos of them just being happy together he would send me directly on a regular basis). It hurt cause why could they be happy but we couldn’t. Let me promise you they are not happy. And if they are they won’t be long term unless this guy is the best actor on the planet. I feel like it’s common knowledge now that people cannot hid who they are for prolonged periods of time without slipping up. Think of how poorly he treated you, she will almost definitely experience the same at some level. 

Looking to the future, finding a healthy FP to replace this one so that you can move past his behaviour. Not looking for a replacement but finding someone positive to focus your energy on is definitely the way to go. 
I took a hiatus from dating after my whole experience with that EX which is what worked for me, looking at what exactly I gravitated towards in past relationships and what to avoid but most importantly looking at how I acted in the relationship which I could improve upon.

As humans, we rise, we fall, and fall many times, getting back up again with some sort of resilience. It's a very misunderstood disorder, and many form inaccurate judgments on bpd, which reinforce shame amongst us who suffer the daily pain and misery of sensitively and disregulated emotions. We only have ourselves to believe that we are not our mental health only. We are much more beyond that. We are deserving of love , compassion, and understanding. If loved ones can not tolerate us at our worst, then that is their choice. You learn the art of knowing that despite the negative traits/symptoms of bpd, it's a double-edged sword, we feel intensely, we love deeply, for we have lots to offer also, we aren't immune to LOVE, to be loved! It's important that we do not believe negative perceptions of us of this disorder that can increase our suffering. We have to create a loving relationship with ourselves. We can not rely on others for that. It is a difficult rd, one that is relentlessly trying, one that makes you feel very alone. Again, we can not rely on others' approval or acceptance. It's the patience, love, care, forgiveness, and  tolerance of ourselves that lesson suffering.

1bk7spa,i feel this way too,bpdbtch,False,1711075827.0
1bk7spa,"I had a moment like this myself a few months ago, and honestly, it absolutely destroyed me. However, the fact that you're realizing this now and you know that you don't want to hurt anyone or even continue doing so is a good sign. 

My suggestion is to tell whom I am assuming is your partner(?) that you've realized these things and that hearing that stuff from his friends really made you truly realize it. And try to keep the conversation short but not too full of emotion and also not none at all, neutral at best. But also go into it expecting your person to want some space for a few days or to end things(or both), both of which are things that are hard to accept, but, are things that in the end you cannot control. I'd suggest using that break time to do things you enjoy and also spending time with other friends as well. I've found that it's super important to not completely isolate yourself. Having a few people around you that you enjoy being with can really help distract you from the negative thoughts. However, I will say that it's also super important to also listen to what your person is saying. It's so easy when we're feeling disregulated or upset to not fully comprehend what the other person is trying to tell you.

If you follow each other on social media, my suggestion is that you don't. I'm not saying to not follow each other on everything, but only specific things like twitter, Instagram, facebook, tiktok, etc. 
My person and I currently have that set up bc they understand that it's for my own mental well-being so I'm not obsessively checking their socials. The only socials that we're sharing are discord, snap, and deviantart. We've both found that were a lot less triggered by each other having it set up like that. That may not work for you, but it's given me piece of mind. It was really hard at first, but now I'm not constantly overthinking every little thing they're posting and assuming its about me when most of the time it wasn't.

But in the end, what your person decides to do is their choice, whether thats leaving or deciding to stay. The only thing you can do is how you respond, even if the initial feeling is that you want to respond how you usually do. Its very tempting and super hard. It still is for me when something triggers me. Also, if he decides that he wants to stay then its super important that you try your best to communicate with him and that he communicates with you, but don't force him to. If you feel yourself starting to get upset, try taking a few minutes to try to regulate yourself before trying to say why something upset you. I suggest doing that in a separate room to avoid feeling rushed or even more triggered. Old habits die hard, but it's necessary to change them when you finally realize how its impacting you and the people around you. Unfortunately BPD means that you're constantly having to think about how you are reacting or going to react to people and situations in order to hopefully not come across manipulative or abusive. This also means learning new phrases, because I've learned that a lot of the phrases that I would(and still do) use, despite me actually meaning those things, are phrases that people would use to intentionally abuse or gaslight others with. Trying to find basically an entirely new vocabulary to use to be able to say how you feel in a healthy way without it coming across as abusive is also super hard, but god does it help. 

I really hope none of this sounded condescending in any way and that I said some things that could be useful advice for you. I'm truly hoping that you're able to repair the relationship you have with your person. <3",Witchy888,False,1711153248.0

1biydy8,"hey OP. i’m glad ur reaching out for advice and support that’s a great first step. i think from an unbiased perspective and coming from someone who also has bpd, you may be a little bit unreasonable with this situation and things happen causing some delays in getting back home. maybe try to identity what exactly you’re worried about happening if she’s late (do you think she’s cheating etc etc?) and maybe bring up these concerns and doubts up with her. i’d say you’re entitled to this feeling and allowed to feel this way as you mentioned it has to do w ur past traumas but id recommend that now you think about how to go about this. rmbr tht bpd is an explanation for behaviour not an excuse. so try to figure out the what now? ik that this behaviour is from my past trauma but how do i fix this now and go about it? i feel like if this is a huge deal breaker for u then maybe you can consider leaving her idk but i’d say weigh the pros and cons of staying in this relationship. best of luck OP hope eveything works out for the best for you and ur partner and hope ur doing better now :’)",little7bean,False,1710893490.0

1bivucx,"I was recently diagnosed myself, and I read quite a lot of self-help books. I take the reading or audio books and take notes of what things I feel may benefit me. In the beginning, it's quite difficult to accept, and it takes time for it to fully be comprehended in your mind. It's been almost 6 months for me now, and I'm in a lot better of a place. Focus on eating as healthy as you can, and possibly take vitamins and take medical medications they suggest you take. You may also take more sick days than others to focus on your mental health. As an employer, they legally have to accommodate these side effects. Figure out a creative hobby with your mind or hands, so writing, crafting, sewing, etc. Re- evaluate your core beliefs as those are important for having balance and stability in having this mental illness. Try either jouraling or mood assessing/tracking as sometimes there are patterns as to when ""attacks"" can happen. For example, I know an attack is happening when I wake up in the morning and I feel the weight of a rock or have immediate suicidal or harmful ideations, as those tend to be side affects of this disability. Also, know it may be a part of you, but it doesn't define you. It's categorized as a mood disorder due to having to mature too fast at a young age to support emotionally unstable environments. I was over sexualized by my family quite a lot due to my petite frame of body with curves. Try your best to avoid any stressful situations as best as possible. Pinterest and the internet have lots of good resources or the public library or thrift stores as well if struggling to find affordable items. The faster you accept it and ignore any feelings of outsider judgment, the faster you'll understand and accept who you are. I work as a sales associate and some customers. I've been really honest with them in certain conversations, mentioning I have bpd. It isn't talked about a lot because people with bpd also tend to have addiction problems at times because we reach out to certain negative aspects, hoping that can help us, but it never does. Therefore, most times, we are frowned and judged upon, but they never ask how we aquired it either, environmental,  genetically, or both. Find healthy coping skills and abilities.

While not everybody might immediately resonate with your unique qualities, trust me when I say that there will be others out there who genuinely admire and cherish every single thing about you - quirks included. So my advice would be to keep pushing forward, stay optimistic, and never lose faith in yourself.

1bhsmuf,"i got diagnosed 4 years ago but the symptoms started showing about 8 years ago. 
simple answer: yes it usually does get better. 
i feel like 4 years ago, i had almost ZERO healthy coping skills, i had absolutely no control over my emotions and how i expressed them, i could barely hold a job.

today i can say i have many skills (mostly DBT skills) in my ""tool belt"" and i have created a support system i can reach out to when i'm too burnt out to use my skills or maybe ive used them and still need support and thats what they're there for. you cant go thru BPD alone. you need at least one person you can count on. 

it used to feel like i was on this insane rollercoaster with huuuuge ups and downs and i rarely had like a stable straight route. 
now i feel like the ups and downs are more mild and the big downs are way less often and don't last as long. 

in the really low times, i still struggle with SI and SH thoughts but at least now i have steps to take and i 9 times out of 10 WANT to reach out for help instead of actually wanting to plan anything. 

i'm currently working on trying to create lots of beneficial micro habits for myself that kinda keep me on track. otherwise i will literally lay in bed any chance i get.

thank u so so so much for the last paragraph 🥺🫶🏻 ur right it’s am easier said than done but so necessary to understand. i’m not rly spiritual but i didn’t know the buddhist’s said that so thank u for educating me. that is so beautifully said. aw man why r we like this (pwbpd) 😕 why do we get attached so fast and then when / if the person leaves (which is always a possibility), we get so extremely hurt. to me it seems like i’m literally deteriorating and like i need to lash out in an attempt to survive. i feel like i’m drowning and i’m trying to stay above the surface of the water so i don’t literally die but it’s so freaking difficult. why why why r we like this? it’s so unfair it’s so annoying. sorry for my rant but i’m so sick of this disorder and everything that comes w it. i got diagnosed at 19 and i’m turning 21 next month. ik it’s worse in early adulthood but man i’m already tired asf. i don’t wanna deal w this any longer (not hinting at suicide dw i’m j sayin i’m frustrated). but anyway have u been in dbt or doing anything other than support group to help manage the symptoms? any advice? and how long does it take to get better ? i’m sorry i feel like a little kid begging for help or for answers that may not always be available ik there may not be a definite clear answer for this ig i j want some comfort to know it gets better and not much longer of this suffering.

1. consistent feelings of emptiness -  i feel this way as well, constantly.
2. persistent and unstable sense of self - i will say this; in terms of mimicking, it isn't just mimicking the way someone talks. it is also mimicking the bad parts of someone. i have realized i also mimic my ex partners behaviors that aren't good behaviors as well as his typical behaviors. (he's my most recent ex/fp, he split up with me two weeks ago due to my bpd being wildly out of wack.)
3. unstable relationships - this one screams bpd. 100%. it hurts to read cuz i know how it feels to be in love and in a fairytale like love to hating the person suddenly.
4. repetitive suicidal thoughts, threats, gestures or behaviors - i also constantly having that thought in my mind. it's always sitting in the back of my mind. i ODed before, a few years ago. the thoughts, threats, gestures and behaviors haven't left since. i've told my mom i'd do it in front of her one time when she made me very angry. i tend to go to suicidal thoughts/threats after most arguments with my most recent ex. i'm not sure why but i feel like i crumble to the ground and i just want it to be over. i'm not very in control of myself at this point and i just want it all to end most days. so i get it. 100%.
5. frantic efforts to avoid abandonment - this sounds a lot like bpd as well. i sometimes want people who hurt me. i sometimes don't care that they did. i chalk it up to i deserve it because of my bpd. i don't know if you do that.

My kids make my life a million times better. I truly value them and they have taught me so much. Being a mother is about sacrificing, your body, time, energy, and emotions. Balancing motherhood is a delicate balancing that has brought me enormous joy. If you are in a good financial place with a good support system you can easily get resources for yourself and child. 

Now the bad side is all of the joy comes with lack of sleep, unexpected illnesses/disabilities, breastfeeding or formula feeding, possible milestone challenges. Rising cost of raising children, child care is crazy expensive if you need it. Then they need iPads, computers, clothing, extra curricular activities. You have to be ready to travel with them. I personally don’t travel with babies under 3years old too much work. Then it’s family friendly places. Your friends can change, your body may or may not go back to before. Life will continue to happen, your child will not be perfect. You won’t be perfect.

1b943nb,"100% relatable as I near my one year anniversary of my diagnosis. A year ago I wouldn’t have understood or been in a similar situation and frustrated AF!

For me, it was/is the fine tuning of a filter. I tried to figure out how, in my head, I can hear/see/feel something so differently than the person standing next to me. Finally, what I came up with was adjusting my filter. How I viewed them, the situation, or both. I used an eye doctor visit and said, which one seems better? 1 or 2? Then I used the idea of taking photos and zooming in, changing lenses, etc. anything to see things at face value, and better put myself in the shoes of the other person.

I said to myself, is this how you see it with fresh, healthy eyes? Or is this a tainted picture, image, or something. I breathe in and out, listen to my heart and brain and then let it go. Let go of my old way of thinking about it. And focused on being present, in the moment.

I used to hear my wife’s comments as negative, as harsh, as not loving or caring. The same with her actions at times. For the vast majority of the time she was just informing, not judging or letting the criticism flow. I was, like you said, hung up on something minor, something only I felt or knew about and that threw off my filter and made me angry or defensive. 

It’ll take practice. Learn to let go. Learn to take them at face value, and to learn how best to bring things up that reflect reality, not what my brain wants me to think.

I hope this made sense. Busy day at work so I wrote this over a longer period and didn’t edit enough :)

I’m trying to bargain with myself and part of me is desperate to try to get him to come back. I’m having insane cognitive dissonance over all of it but I know it will only get worse if I don’t get him out of my life. 

I feel permanently put off ever trying to be in a relationship again. I don’t want to believe that I fell for this again.

1b7z59k,"(Basically everything below should start with ""If you haven't already / didn't already know,"" because I don't know your level of knowledge here)

I have BPD myself. Candidly, yes he's probably going to rage-break-up again, if he isn't practicing skills. Unchecked BPD is like pb&j with self-destructive breakups followed by desperate remorse.

That's to say, it is his responsibility to seek help and intervention. Does he do DBT? Practice a healthy lifestyle to his best ability? Looked at meditative hobbies or even things like Buddhism? (Which is what saved my life, personally) Does he have a psychiatrist? Medication? Things he enjoys and could cultivate? Have substance use concerns or other addictions? Does he have other hobbies besides you?

I really hope the answer are all yes, and things are improving. But, I don't get the sense that's true right now.

On his end, just to give context, it takes constant vigilance for someone with BPD to monitor and adjust their behavior using their DBT skills, or similar. It's an unrelenting demand to ""be better"" for yourself and your loved ones, and it *is* laborious and painstaking. However, it is his deal to manage it, at the end of the day, hard as it is. It's just our lot in life, because if we don't, it's a self-destructive mess. But, doesn't change the points above, and it's worth noting that BPD is actually extremely treatable in the sense that fairly moderate changes can lead to big improvements, the key is him practicing practicing practicing. It is more than possible for him to make strides; he is not stuck this way, not inherently.

However, on your end, you'll have to chose whether you can handle it (*particularly* if he isn't making efforts). The flightiness, splitting, the emotional whiplash, and often, the harsh words borne of humiliated rage. The breaking up.

You have every right in the world to take care of yourself and get some respite in the form of breaking up, at *least* for now. More than rights, even, you have just as much responsibility for your own wellbeing as he does.

I really want to stress that if he brings up suicide or self-harm, etc., when or if you decide to go this route, you should not allow this to shift your sense of personal responsibility. This may not come up at all, hopefully. But, if he's in life-threatening danger, call someone else for help, do not bear the burden yourself. (Someone else like his family members or siblings or friends, if you can). It's common to suggest calling the police, I personally don't advocate for this.

Lastly, it's very important that you know that none of this is about you. As in, if he does break up with you in that destructively impulsive way, it has nothing to do with how good of a partner you are or having failed him in some way. It absolutely sucks and hurts but I urge you to remember that it is not you, but rather it is your partner having a flare-up of the BPDemon in his brain. He's feeling agony too, which makes the whole thing so terrible for everyone. But it isn't you, your failings, your selflessness, or your loyalty, it is him and the thing that's lodged in our brains.

Very last thing: I recommend a book called *I Hate You Don't Leave Me*, it discusses BPD and support and it's nature, etc., and it would give both of you more insight.

Very very last thing: Do some research on Favorite Person, that may apply to you and give insight.

VVV last thing: I guess I should say here too that despite all my practical discussion about personal responsibility, I want to note just that... it really does suck having BDP, and the people in my life that I am closest to are those who have continued to be there for me.

1b7z59k,"Thanks so much for this response it really means a lot to me. I am graduating with my masters in social work and I have a degree in psychology. I have looked into bpd and actually diagnosed him before he got an official diagnosis. 

I signed him up for dialectic behavioral therapy and he was attending group sessions and individual sessions. They stopped taking his insurance and this crushed him. He feels nothing will work at this point. 

He is already bringing up suicide and not wanting  to be here anymore. It’s hard to hear but I try my best to be supportive. His older brother committed suicide and he always says he’s mad his brother beat him to it. In the same breath he tells me I am the only reason he doesn’t do it. 

It’s hard we are 27 and I want to start building my life with him and he’s struggling with age regression and finding himself. I tried to get him to attend therapy and try medication he says he will but I’m not sure if he really will. I really love this man and it sucks I don’t want to lose him. I’m hoping we can work it out with the space I am providing him and I hope it doesn’t end in a break up. My parents watched me struggle through our last break up and it took a lot for them to like him again if we break up and get back together they will be so disappointed in me and never like him again.",Any_Education_1034,True,1709734654.0

1aw2hgb,"you sound like you really care about him and are also very self aware about your patterns and symptoms which is good. i completely relate to this as someone with bpd, the introspective kind, and i have more of a problem with over empathising and disregarding my own needs. because of how i grew up, im a lot more likely to walk on eggshells to keep the peace than to blow up and say or do things ill later regret. this means a lot of my needs go unnoticed unless i consciously speak up about them. a fair few if not most of my bpd episodes arise from fear of abandonment which is brought up when i feel as though one or several of my needs are being ignored, when in reality often times, i just haven’t communicated them. id say try and understand what you need from him and then tell him, as well as asking him what he needs and wants from you! from experience both living with bpd and loving someone with bpd-like episodes, usually all it takes to deescalate a conflict is an open, kind conversation where we both listen to each other and speak gently until we understand each others point of view and why the argument arose in the first place. the fact that you are asking how you can be a good partner is a good sign that you have the capability to be one! something ive learned is that staying silent and suppressing yourself because you think it will make you a better partner will not do the relationship any good. sometimes setting boundaries is very difficult if you’re used to ignoring yourself to stay safe, but once you are with a safe person, setting boundaries and speaking up about what you need from your partner is integral for a healthy connection so everyone feels heard and cared for and there is no built up resentment from lack of communication. good luck to you and your boyfriend and remember that while it’s great that you care so much about others, you also deserve someone who will listen to you and love you without you having to make yourself smaller 🫶🏻",shawdybroken,False,1708619566.0

https://www.borderlinepersonalitydisorder.org/most-accurate-article-on-bpd-we-have-recently-read-kudos/

Also, not sure if this applies to your situation, but we kind of go into one side of the spectrum at a time. So them blocking/ unfriending you when emotions are triggered can be pretty common. It’s kind of… self-defense? Fight or flight? Not self-defense from you exactly but more so from how they perceive you might act if they don’t hole up in some form. It kind of gives us control if someone outside of us could potentially hurt us, especially people we really care about. It’s definitely not healthy but that can be worked on if the person is open to it.

1asfix4,"Hey OP! I know this struggle so well, and you are definitely not alone.

Something that helped in my circumstances was a couple of things:

1. Knowing I had BPD and learning about it; knowing a lot about why I’ve done what I’ve done (basically that “aha!” moment)
2. Coming to understand that obsessively friending, then unfriending, or sending a message and then deleting the message or following up with my thoughts one after the other in multiple messages after initial message and the like, is–how I see it– something of a subform of *splitting*
3. Choosing and learning to believe people when they say this or that about you (positives only; but taking less than positive things is a diff convo)
4. Identifying the feelings you get in the moment when you do those things, naming it and reflecting on the why. What’s triggering that response? When it happens, write it down (eg, “today I friended Elly again, then unfriended her. At this moment I was feeling anxiety because… and then delve into that further). This sometimes helped with my spirals
5. When you see the pattern and the triggers, it was then about processing after that and then learning to catch myself before I deleted a message or sent additional texts or unfriended
6. Always, always, always remember that practice and learning better habits is NOT linear! Give yourself grace if it’s not something you’re able to catch every time
7. Realizing that part of my personal trigger for this was obsessing about the “am I being annoying, do they like me, etc” and that by hyper focusing on that made me super twitchy and to get rid of that anxiety I decided to “un-do it”. I began practicing the “I friended them/ sent that message, now I’m going to focus on something else, and if it’s important enough, or they specifically ask me to, I will leave it alone.” The urge began to stick after a while. To this day, I still wonder if I’m being annoying or if someone doesn’t like me but it’s manageable most of the time now. But then that leads to:
8. Wherein you can’t control what other people think of you, but you can control how you put yourself out there with your actions and decisions.

OP, you’ve noticed this is something you do that you don’t find helpful or healthy, and you mentioned your loved ones are or seem to be getting annoyed by the consistent back and forth, right? Don’t let that destroy you! You’ve taken a great step by even having the reflection that this is not how you want to keep behaving and then reaching out.

There’s no quick fix to BPD, there’s either remaining stagnant and drowning in it, or taking the process of overcoming certain aspects one step at a time and making progress down the path you want to walk.

I know you mentioned that you aren’t comfortable sharing your diagnosis with your loved ones, but perhaps in the future that will change. And I really think it could potentially help, and them; them, so that they can understand it’s not just you being annoying or too much on purpose, but that there’s an actual reason for it and you’re actively working on making it better because you care for them and (I hope more importantly) about yourself. And it’d potentially help you because when a person takes ownership of things like this, you’re giving yourself the power over how you feel, and taking it away from others (or at least how we perceive that).

Off topic example of owning it to keep the power in your hands: I had the crown/tooth next to my front tooth fall out and it’s unrepairable. I could get an implant but that will be hella expensive and around a year plus long wait. I am super self conscious about my teeth as is since I didn’t take care of them in childhood and it’s haunting my ass now. But I figured, “Ok, I’ll just wear a mask everywhere”. I hated that. So this last Tuesday when I went to campus for class I was wearing a mask and made a decision for myself. (Helps if there’s one person you feel a semblance of safety with at first when practicing this; it doesn’t have to be your FP or BFF 5eva). I spoke up right before class began (like a minute or seconds before), and started off with a little joke announcement “So I know we’re all judgment free in this class, except when it comes to Professor A’s dad jokes (insert snorts of laughter) but I wanted to sort of tell you all this”, and proceeded to basically say “My tooth fell out, I’m not sick (as I took off my mask) and I don’t want to wear this mask so here’s my adorable smile minus one teephers”. And I actually showed the class while sitting all chill-like in my seat. I further added, “I know it’s weird I’m announcing this but I’m doing it because it gives me the power to own it on my terms since I can be self conscious about it, so there you have it!” Lots of nods and “that’s awesome’s” and “I love that!” were the responses.

And wow that’s long. Anyway:

**Tl;dr** OP has made a significant step by 1) taking note of this behavior and wanting to change it as well as 2) seeking support in my opinion.

Especially if this isn’t something one has tried/done before.

Step 1: Note when intrusive thoughts are occurring. eg, “I’m such a horrible person for going driving today, if I hadn’t, that person that flipped me off wouldn’t have done that…” Whether you identify this when you’re thinking or you correlate it to a feeling/sensation you get, it doesn’t matter, as long as your brain trips enough for you to notice “oh, intrusive thoughts are happening.” Push yourself to then proceed to the next step (but if you can’t, FORGIVE yourself. It’s not a competition on whether you’re strong enough or good enough, it’s you pausing on the step you’re on and ruminating, taking a break.)

Step 2: Once you take this step, have a focal point that means something to you that you latch onto after identifying you’re in intrusive thought mode for a bit of reprieve. Basically choose something that you love (which is going to be used as a sort of coping mechanism). Is there anything that you’re currently geeking out about, etc?  A date, platonic or romantic or familial you’re excited about? A party or night in you want to plan? It could just be a happy memory or person, animal, object you feel fondly of. It could even be taking note of the area or objects around you; really looking at the sky and wondering if you can accurately guess the temperature or marveling at its color, or seeing an object and thinking “if someone from the far future or distant past suddenly found it, what would they think of it?”

Step 3: *Experience* what you’ve chosen. This is where you immerse yourself into letting go, however temporarily, of those intrusive thoughts, to pause yourself for reflection and feeling OUTSIDE of those spiraling thoughts. 

This is not the only way. And it might not be the right one for you. But I think that because you’ve noted these thoughts have been painful and haunting you, and that you reached out somewhere, you’re a lot further along to the place you’d rather be. And that alone tells me you’re strong. So keep trying, keep experimenting with things, you will find a way.

But remember, give yourself grace even when those intrusive thoughts don’t want you to. While they are trying to protect you in a way, you also know better of the love you deserve from yourself.",the-panda-general,False,1707696720.0
1angem1,"It’s not a stupid reason. That is a form of quality time for y’all and it’s understandable that while you’re in pain and (I imagine) wanting more of that for comfort, them doing that might’ve felt like taking something away from you. 
It helps me to remember that the game and  something they enjoy alone and sharing it with me is a different experience in itself. 
If you know you’re in a spiral about it, personally I would mention to them that you know and it’s bothering you. Remind them that alone time is important and you want them to have that, it only hurts they did what they said they wouldn’t and the pain is making everything brighter and bigger for you. 
My partner has asked when I start those type conversations that I give them a bit of a disclaimer so they can shift into the appropriate headspace. Ex: “hey I’ve had something on my mind that’s turning into a spiral, I don’t want it to turn into self sabotaging. Do you have the mental space to listen and help me navigate through these thoughts? I don’t want to believe they’re true but they’re so loud in my head”

Ur hurt, ur splitting, it happens, what i do to understand my emotions is to sleep, re evaluate and solve things. It might be tough in ur case because of ur pain. So not sure what would be the best option if u have to do this on ur own.

One other thing u can do is, tell ur partner ur splitting on them, and the pain, ur issues and overthinking is making u go spiral. Tell her that u understand the situation and u need time to process ur emotions. My advice would be to not push them away and ask for space, but keep them close, hug them or cuddle with them, rest with them so ur assured that they are gonna be with you. Do this, it will help to not add abandonment issues to ur spiral of emotions. U can have space just by telling them that u need time to process stuff and by asking them if they can just be affectionate to you while resting with you.",luv2001,False,1707575677.0
1alyfh8,"you're confused if the ill feelings are just you splitting and your mind playing tricks on you or if they genuinely hold ground. 

you can take space from her. spend some time apart. go no-contact for a while, your mental peace comes first. it is impossible to maintain a healthy friendship with a person you're having negative notions and doubts about. you can't even give her a piece of your raw mind (obviously), so you're basically having to play pretend. you feel trapped. this isn't healthy for you at all and I know it's eating you inside and it's agonising to be there for her while harbouring resentment within. 

The more you try to push them down, the more they'll grow. you'll constantly be in a state of mental turmoil if you continue staying in touch with her. you shouldn't have to ignore your rising feelings and stay despite the internal stress caused by this connection cuz that'll mean you abandoning yourself for the sake of this friendship. what's going on within will come to the surface eventually and it'll be too late and more destructive even. 

so give yourself a break. a couple of weeks or whatever amount of time you will. this will prevent the feelings from getting stronger or hardened into facts and relieve you of the burden of having to play nice. the splitting and resentment feelings are usually strengthened because you feel like you're being forced to stay despite not liking it and you blame the opposite person for it. so get away. you must remember that YOU'RE in control. you have free will, don't stay when it's distressing you. 

regain control over yourself and allow yourself to cut her off temporarily for the good of BOTH of you. this'll help you gain freedom and autonomy. them let all the feelings out and sort them by yourself. sit with these feelings and once the intense emotions have died down a bit, pause. take a step back. look at the entire relationship from a neutral, 3rd person pov. you can go to a couple of friends you trust with the issues and gain their honest opinions, if you want surety. remember to stay self-aware and not let bpd's faulty lens of reality rule over your logical, healthy thinking. practice self-control and govern your thoughts. see things for what they were, without personal biases. get the mental clarity you need. 

THEN if you find evidence that your feelings are indeed justified and not just your bpd, you can have a talk with her, hold your ground and either she takes accountability and you make peace with the past or you cut her off for good, whichever makes you feel better. and if its proven otherwise, then you can continue with the connection as usual with no more hard feelings and stress. in either case, you won't lose anything. don't beat yourself up over it!",Adwis_jungkook,False,1707410440.0

I'm currently waiting for disability. I'm similar to how you are, I would prefer to be alone. It's just easier most times. I know some people who experience this type of trauma can move past many things and improve themselves with therapy. No one can say for sure but at least try.

you're probably ruminating and rethinking and continuously playing over the scenarios of what happened between the two of you and what will happen in the future, but that is giving away all your power to her. you need to stay in control of yourself.

cut her off. no arguments, no conflict resolving since it's obvious that she simply dumps her problems onto you but isn't interested in or emotionally available and matured enough to handle you and listen to you. which is NOT okay. it is supposed to be a two-way street. it's an absolute lose-lose situation for you OP.

you need to cut her off and take away your availability for her and her presence in your life completely first. you can't feel better or heal with her in the picture. once she's out of your life, you can deal with yourself and sit with yourself and know that no matter what you'd bpd self makes you feel, you're better off without her. you'll find instant relief without her to worry about or the future to be hypervigilant about.",Adwis_jungkook,False,1707182634.0

This is frustrating to hear this because budgeting is a really hard skill, and it could seem impossible if you never learned it early on and don’t have the means to now. Then add in BPD and we feel like Jeff Bezos when we have anything extra. 

I struggle a lot budgeting myself, but one thing I’ve recognized about myself is I hate spending physical cash, or I at least think twice of what else I could use it for that day or that week (remember, my budgeting skills are not strong 😅). One thing I’ve learned about myself is I’m more likely to hold on and value a physical asset than I am numbers on the screen, and it’s helped me save at least $50-$100 extra per paycheck (before my next emergency/impulse). Every payday, I take a good balance out of the ATM and divide it 70/20/20 for necessities, savings and fun. 

It might not be the answer you’re looking for, but I hope it’s a step in the right direction of seeing the relation of your income to where and it’s spent.

193n9sl,"i’m 21f with bpd. I was with my boyfriend for 8 months before he ended things two weeks after finding out I was pregnant. Now we don’t even speak and i’m doing the pregnancy alone. I had the “obsessive” behavior towards him too. At the beginning he was also that way but it quickly died out on his end. We said I love you after 5 days of knowing each other and I moved two hours away from home to live with him a week later. There’s no way to “hide” how much you love her, and there’s nothing wrong with how much you love her and want to be with her. Don’t try to dull your emotions just so the other person doesn’t leave you. 

We had broken up twice before this last one that stuck and I did the same thing- crying and begging them to give me another chance and they did but it just was never the same. I know the pain all too well of feeling like you’re always gonna be the person who loves the other person more. I cant give you any advice on how to make them stay because really if it’s because of how much you like her and her previous relationship causing the issues, there’s nothing you can do about that. However, I can tell you the one thing I wish I would’ve done in my relationship. Learn to love being with yourself as much as you love being with her. Make sure you don’t abandon the things you love and your favorite hobbies. She is just a person and that’s okay, so are you. Remember not to place all your value into her because you need to learn to be okay if she decides this isn’t what she wants anymore. I truly never learned how to live without my ex while we were together and that left me destroyed in the end. Even if you guys do end up staying together, always make sure that she is not your entire world. She can be a big part of your world and make your world feel like it makes more sense but she cannot be your ENTIRE world.

I’ll start by saying that it’s good you’re setting boundaries and receiving continuous professional support. I would stick to what your therapist suggests rather than what your partner has said concerning medication etc. I can confirm that there aren’t really many medications than can help with a BPD mind. People often equate it to something like anxiety or depression (as these are common symptoms for us and can be treated with meds) But if anything, I think BPD is more akin to something like being on the spectrum. It’s more just that our brains are wired differently at a core level. I usually find explaining it this way to those who don’t understand BPD helps a bit more. 
It does sound like your partner has some problematic behaviours, and it’s worth taking the time to think about whether they’re open to working through them, and whether you’re up for standing by them whilst they do. Outburst of anger are a big no for me, but you may be someone who handles that stuff well.  We can’t really tell you whether you should end it or not, that’s down to you. I guess it’s all about balance and protecting your peace. If they’re making you feel worse, then it may not be worth continuing the relationship x",Accomplished_Funny51,False,1704828249.0

(22F- here) I’m sorry to hear that you have been struggling. I can relate in the sense of Sexual intimacy being challenging at times for me as well due to trauma. And I can completely sympathize with you on how much of a mental toll it takes on you. 

I’m not sure if you would also find this helpful or if you would be comfortable with it. But have you maybe tried to find ways to pleasure yourself? When I did, I found it not only helped a little with working on some of the trauma my body was holding but you also get to find what you can find enjoyable that is not a trigger to you. And that can help when sharing the moment with your partner. 

Have you looked up free counselling services in your area? I’m located in Canada but not sure if it’s offered where you are, but worth looking into. It might not always be as great as a therapist but it’s something. It could be either short or long term 1:1 counselling ,those CBT/DBT modules you do &/or support group. 

Touching on what your partner says, I know that to some folks sexual intimacy in a relationship is very important. But I do find the reaction of a cold “yes” wasn’t the kindest. Have you tried to have a in-depth conversation about what’s hard for you and how you could both work towards finding a “middle-ground” for a lack of better terms?

As soon as there is a new issue he throws all my efforts in my face. He points on that I'm selfish and I don't appreciate him and I don't take his feelings into consideration. That is what I'm stuck with because we work on an issue and move past it but as soon as another issue that isn't related comes up he throws those words at me,Street-Tangerine1429,True,1704476171.0
18z9ycs,"Preaching to the choir.  I've been feeling the exact same way with my own boyfriend.  Thankfully him and I communicate and talk every time something happens.  Feeling as if you've been doing something right the whole time only to feel like you fall back down the hill and have to start all over.  Have you spoken with your own boyfriend about how his reactions have been affecting you?  I know full well it can be exhausting knowing you have to keep apologizing for the same mistakes over and over.  It's also ok to admit your wrong doings (ie being selfish, or self-centered). It's going to hurt like heck, but admitting your problems is a good place to start.  Nobody wants to admit they've had toxic behavior.  Agreeing that this is a part of you will absolutely help your relationships with others.

You made me feel less crazy by reading your post, honestly.  I haven't encountered another person who has described to a T the exact same way I feel.  So you're not alone.

Then they feel bad because they hurt you is what you have to understand is it's not on purpose. I have been reading stuff to but I find a lot of it you have to read between the lines it's not a one size fits all. If your someone who needs to talk about it and she doesn't then ask her if she would be ok if you talked to someone about everything don't just do it the reason I she that is because my wife doesn't like if I tell people about the stuff we talk about. Which is completely fine with me. Some people may not be ok with  not talking to people about it. It  takes alot of  mind work for yourself to be ok doing it by yourself and the way I I'm doing it may not be for everybody but you may have to talk to other people about it my wife personally doesn't like when I share certain things about it and that's fine that's her choice and I respect her choices but you also have to remember that this isn't meant to be rude but may come off that way but look at it as this when they're in an episode it's  kind of like walking through a minefield but you just have to be careful that you don't step on what's going to trigger them. my wife normally likes when I'm super clingy likes but when she's in an episode she fuckin absolutely hates it it's because you have to read between the lines and stuff cuz like you can go read about it all you want but you have to find what work for you guys not what works for everyone else. all reality triggers are different for everybody sometimes it might not even be something you did it could be a season my wife I find it's more of the season like I said earlier but it is difficult you have to just work through it. Just be open with her about how you feel but you need to makes sure you use "" I "" statements I found that help alot because if you don't make it clear they are your feels and that  they didnt do anything because it will cause their mind to start to run and they will begin to let their  worst intrusive thoughts run and it could actually make it a lot worse because in all reality it's basically a giant fear that you're not good enough for anyone and that eventually you'll leave them. they can love you as much as they want and you can love them as much as you want you just have to keep in mind that if you didn't do  anything wrong and it seems like they're pulling away then just know that you that's when you need to be there for them and you need to be the Rock while they're in their hard place you get what I'm saying but it is extremely worth it if you can figure out what works for you and the person you're with that has BPD.

I had offers to visit family in a different state but didn’t feel like driving. I have been absolutely panic stricken leading up to this week, just riddled with anxiety all month long trying to figure out how I’m going to cope without causing drama or ending up in a hospital, mainly bc I struggle with intrusive thoughts of SI. I went to the beach today and things were good but when I got home I was very triggered and was fighting off the most intense SI thoughts I’ve ever had, and then had to take a kalonopin and did some positive affirmation meditations for anxiety. My stress and anxiety and intrusive thoughts completely melted away. My hope is to keep up this practice for as long as it takes to overcome my fear of being alone.

1. I needed to be in an office. I was working remotely for 4 years and literally went insane without daily human interaction. Everyone is different but working remotely just doesn’t work for me bc I can’t be trusted within 100 ft of a bed.
2. I used to have meetings all day and night, Europe in the early morning, east coast in the afternoon, west coast in the evening, Asia at night. Not every day but I was in a global position and my meeting schedule was unpredictable and stressful and I fucking loathed it.
3. I was in a strategic position that came with a lot of pressure to generate revenue - it was beyond stressful and my nervous system was wrecked after prolonged stress and I fell into a long depressive episode after my breakdown.

I ended up finding a new job that pays less but it’s so much less stressful. I have daily tasks that are boring but easy and predictable. When I leave everyday I don’t have to think about work at all. I leave it at the door and focus on other things when I get home.

Some times my mind is like a solid piece of cement with intense tension right in the middle and I have to listen for 6 hours of videos before the cement cracks n crumbles and I find some releif.🥵

Your son is ten years old, he is yet a small child. I have children myself, and I’ve worked in a field with taking care of children, so i would know. 

Your son didn’t show you disrespect, he showed loved for the one person he wants to keep as a an extra person, except from you. He is your mother, he knows you’re going to be there anyways, and frankly he should take your love for granted. He wasn’t looking for anything to someone else, he was ordering things to himself and saw something cheap that he remembered his step dad likes. That’s impressive and very kind. A 10 years old doesn’t have to use his own money to buy things to everyone else. That’s not fair, nor teaches him anything other than he should be careful showing love to anyone because his own mother will punish him. 

You should have made him give his present on Christmas morning or something. And you should’ve been proud of your own flesh and blood for being so kind. 

Of course I understand it stings that he didn’t buy or make you anything, and you could’ve just said “hey, you know I’m silly about gifts and really like them. Can’t you make me something? I’d love to get something from you too”. But ultimately he’s a child, and is not responsible for your feelings. 


If you don’t work on your perspective, you’re going to really mess him up when he becomes a teenager. A teenage son won’t talk as much to you, or want to hang with you as much, and you really need to start preparing for it. You are a mother, and your responsibility is beyond yourself now.

I ask, because you sound like you think you know enough to feel sorry for everyone else. My partner doesnt even know this bothered me and still doesnt, and he was home at the time, so im pretty good at hiding it! 
The way you ended your comment, bpd people are horrible parents, they put their own needs before the childs, have you done a geberic google search and read the first thing you found then left it at that and now think youre an expert? Because that is so far from the truth you have no idea. I put everyones needs before my own, my childs, most times my partners aswell as long as it doesnt affect my child negatively in some way.

Personally, if this happened to me, I would probably let them know how their reaction left me feeling in our next session since I'm sure there will be a conversation.

Then i say what?! Can't i go pee?!
Then while i am in there, as a lady we don't realize we have to poop while going pee until it happens..
So, while i am in the bathroom doing my business, he knocks on the door and i say what?!? Leave me alone!!!

Then i get out of the bathroom and he (bob)is standing right outside the door.
He goes towards the bathroom and starts yelling at me telling me that i am fucked up and how i am fucked up for doing that to him...how i knew it was an emergency and he had to go 
Mind you at this point, i really have no fuckin clue what I did exactly so wrong about going to the bathroom.
So he continues to yell at me from outside the bathroom door, mind you, this is also apparently an emergency poop.. 
So I'm back in the kitchen and jim is just laughing about it.
Bob is still yelling about how I'm fucked up and what time is it and how he has the bathroom at a certain time.
I tell him that he is fucked up and that if he was having an emergency, he should have been in the bathroom, went downstairs, not have smoked a cigarette, made coffee or played with the cat.. while this was a so called ""emergency""
 I reminded him that that the exact time i was looking at the clock was 12:33...
Meaning that for the past give or take five minutes he was yelling at me from the bathroom door..

I got into my room after this and cry because i am just completely confused and overwhelmed with emotions and have no idea where this came from or what i did wrong.
I feel like ive blacked out a lot of what happened/ cant remember exactly what is said.. its all vague..
While i am in my room, he bangs on my door not once  or twice, but three times and each one is louder.. i ignore them all, first time I say no, second time I say nothing, third time i say leave me alone
He is outside my door talking shit and saying how i am fucked up.

He leaves...
I get this text 
""You know why when I say I have to take a shit it's already an emergency? Because I avoid doing it until 1230 or until I can't hold it any longer. Do you know why that is? Because I'm affording you max access to the bathroom until it's a factor, and since everyday is a mystery when you're getting up... this morning was fucked up and you absolutely already know you did me dirty. I don't like going downstairs, the water in the bowl is hot and it's a literal asshole spa down there. It's not easy to go when steam has my jawn puckered so tight I can't go. Bottom line, I'm a considerate ass roommate, for much more than that just reason alone. Furthermore I've only been a good friend to you, I'm supportive, encouraging, and when you need a favor I've never turned you down. I shouldn't even be texting this, you could have spared 5 sec to answer your door. I don't deserve that yo, I was only leaving early to go get your gift.""

Days go by, almost a week goes by and i just completely avoid being home.. i don't leave my room in the mornings if he is up or around.. i wait until he leaves.. and I don't come home until after 10 pm..

The day that this all happened and bob finally leaves.. 4th roommate, sarah, comes home and can tell that i had been crying.. she ask whats wrong and i straight up tell her what happened and read the text.

She says nothing.. days later she tells me that i need to confront him and talk to him. That i make it uncomfortable around him and around the house and i don't want to jeopardize my housing situation because of it.
She tells me that i NEED to talk to him and work things out before he leaves for vacation.
I tell her that I don't want to speak to him and that i don't think that i need to apologize, I didn't do anything wrong! 
She didn't care about the details from either bob or Myself..
I told her that it is fucked up and how am i supposed to apologize or even try to talk to someone who doesn't see what they did wrong or isn't even going to hear me out, but also why should i once again have to bow down to another fucking entitled man because i hurt his stupid fucking feelings by standing up for myself?
At this point she tells me she thinks that im splitting and that it is a BPD symptom and asked if i knew what that was...

I told her that i needed time and space and asked for time and space to think about it all and to figure out what exactly happened, but to also not be in a fucking fight or flight mode and to try and calm and levelheaded if and when i spoke to him ..
I tell Sarah, that I hear what she is saying and i am not, not agreeing with her.. 
She leaves the kitchen, not even 5 minutes later, fuck probably even a minute or two later...
Fucking Bob comes into the kitchen and at this point im just like wtf! What the fuck just happened again..

The first thing that Bob says to me..""ya better yet?""
I say what's that supposed to mean? Better than what?!
He gets all pissy about it and says nevermind and basically forces me into a conversation with him about what happens.. i try to deflect and not talk to him because im not in said place to talk.. 
I try to calmly and rationally talk to him about my side of the story...
I told him that i think he overreacted and that he really was the one who is fucked up.
He gets all upset at this point and starts yelling at me again, saying once again how i am fucked up and how when he was outside the bathroom door waiting for me, he heard me brushing my teeth..and how that was fucked up of me because i knew it was an emergency and I just had to go pee.
Then I have to explain myself and explain the nature of female anatomy physics, that I'm sorry i didn't realize i had to poop and went poop, but that I didn't brush my teeth.. i actually didn't..
He doesn't believe me and keeps following me around the house and at this point i just say fuck it, my bad, i am so sorry that I didn't realize it was an emergency and that I went to the bathroom, he kept asking if we're good and that he is trying to not make things uncomfortable..

Then later in the evening after i had to forcibly apologize to this fucking guy, he comes home and knocks on my door and hands me 8 mason jars and says Merry Christmas, these are mason jars that a week or two i got excited about because they have 🐝 on them.. meanwhile he is telling me how much of a big deal it was because he just had to talk to his ex girlfriend about where she got them from and had to go see her to get them as my gift..


In the end, i am feeling conflicted, i keep going back and questioning myself and what i did wrong. I keep blaming myself and wondering what exactly was said and done and what I did that created all of this conflict and was just so fucked up..

I continued to avoid being home until 3 days later when he left for Vaca. 
Meanwhile it is still very uncomfortable around my other roommates..

He thinks it’s unfair for me to expect him to quit when he’s been doing it his whole life and said “what is the point of being together if we aren’t going to have sex? We are just people who hang out and sleep in the same bed.” I asked him if he thought that’s what made a relationship is sex and he said I was twisting his words. So that felt great to hear from him.

Try to have a calm, organized conversation with your boyfriend on how and why it makes you feel. Encourage him to learn more about how negatively such addiction can influence his own life and sexual satisfaction.

Try thinking of it in a physical way if that helps. If you had an open wound, and every time you were around your mother she took a knife and stuck it in that wound, would you honestly feel guilty about staying away from her? Would you honestly let her trick you into believing that it’s your fault that you didn’t get to spend a lot of time with her? Or would you put the blame on her for sticking the knife in every time?

It often feels like there is a lack of endorphins in my head when I withdraw so nothing makes me happy, I feel pain a lot more, and can be irritated by people/disturbed by negative thoughts. If I have the space, it will pass, if I’m forced to ‘perform/interact’ it gets worse because I’m being coerced to ‘put on an act’/ act fake, which causes anxiety and despair. when the withdrawal has passed he should bounce back. Re; your son, maybe you can communicate to your husband that your son is needing some space, so that he doesn’t continue to criticise him or if you feel your able to be honest (without him reacting negatively) , communicate to yr husband that “you” have noticed he’s being a bit critical towards him and maybe it would be good to give your son some space at the moment.

1847gk7,"I am a pwBPD and CPTSD, but I am struggling to be helpful wrt to your son I think. It seems possible to me that your son from the previous relationship could be an issue, either simply their presence and how it changes your dynamic somehow (if something has changed there other than the son’s advancing age). It doesn’t even need to be much at all if your husband is threatened by them, or even anything they or you have actually done as such from my experience, but I imagine rejection in faces (sneers and smirks) where there is none I think. It’s possible he’s split or just dislikes your son, but obviously can’t have you and you alone so feels stuck, I don’t know sorry. I can’t really help too much there, as there’s just my husband (ASD but no trauma) and I and no kids. 

That said this is probably worth mentioning too: My experience of my avoidant leaning disorganised attachment (DA) and BPD is that I can’t fathom why my husband stays with me. I don’t see what positivity he finds in my presence, and honestly I feel really sorry for him, because he’s wasting his life being with me and for not valuing himself more and finding someone better. This is irrespective of an episode on my part, just looking at him lowkey breaks my heart sometimes honestly. I’ve always known a deep and immutable loneliness, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone, so if there’s any chance he’d be more lonely without me, I just can’t do that to him and outright leave him it seems. 

Your husband might be in a similar place, and might be consciously or unconsciously trying to get you to leave, primarily to him it will seem for your sake, but ultimately it’s for his sake too, because it alleviates that guilt of wasting your life, and also any fear he feels about the relationships longevity. You might seem very scary to him right now, because in his mind it might seem like the honeymoon stage is over, so he’s waiting for the inevitable rejection and abandonment. It might seem to him like it’s best to get that hurt over and done with ASAP, so you leaving will just seem better for all involved.

I’ve tried to convince my husband to leave in various ways many times, logically using conversation, and illogically through anger and vitriol, but he’s still here, because he loves me for some reason best known to himself, probably because he’s a naive fool and just doesn’t understand the cancerous mess he’s married, so here we are. The aforementioned convincing on my part didn’t and doesn’t feel like a test, but I guess it was and is to some degree. He’s vehemently and consistently told me he won’t abandon me, and did so even when I was in denial about BPD and the word ‘abandon’ pissed me off, but he kept using it, and as I sit here now typing this, I’m kinda glad he did because it means something to me after all I guess.

I wish you well, but you can’t be the only person doing the work here, and you walking on eggshells is him abusing you pure and simple, it just is.

Talk to your doctor, just say your regiment hasn’t been managing your symptoms great and maybe explore some other options with them.

Now im living with my parents, cause when i was 19/20 i tried to live with my ex bf (he was my fp) and it ended very bad. I was happy after, i think he manipulated me all the time, so im trying to get better and heal. The things that happened with him this summer, got me in a really bad ptsd state. Im always dissociated and i dont feel real 24/7. I got super anxiety mood without explanation and i have a lot of hallucinations. Yes i see a therapist, but in this year i focused only on the relationship i had with this guy and i couldn’t focus on me. I wanted to care only about him. So for me, im doing therapy from august/September.. i tried psychoanalysis for about 3/4 yrs, but it literally killed me inside. Ive never felt so out of control (?). Then my psychiatrist told me to do a cognitive behavioral therapy and it changed my life. Im better now, but when i have my meltdown and my slumps i only see the dark side of my life. Today, as i said, im gonna have my appointment with my psychiatrist and there it will be also my therapist. Im feeling better now, but i fear that its just that im really dissociating from reality. Maybe they’re gonna change my medications, but idk. 
Im actually finishing school, but like my life is not so crazy. Like i always stay home cause i have only 2 friends and one of them is always working (plus i don’t feel good about going out this period, im feeling “better” at home in my bed) and the other is not in a better mood then mine, so shes not so present. Yup i have my family but i dont talk a lot with my father and either with my mother and sister, cause they usually react really bad when i tell them how im really feeling. If im gonna tell my parents that im not in a good mood, that im feeling sad and overwhelmed again, that i have thoughts about killing myself… they’re gonna be anxious and they’re not gonna leave me alone even 1 sec. In the house there will be so much tension and theyre gonna fear about me, about me killing my self. So i dont want to make them worried u know?

I was relieved to get the proper diagnosis, I’ve had years of talk therapy, cbt, so forth. without much progress. Finding the proper diagnosis and treatment was a relief and exhilarating. I’m American and haven’t had any experience with actual psychotherapy, so I actually find the whole thing fascinating. You felt out of control when doing it? From my amateur understanding I could see it being confusing or overbearing with all the talk of drives, unconscious and sub-conscious, Oedipal structures, I don’t know. I like that zizek guy. 

I had some success with cbt, but dbt helped me more. It helped maintain a more stable sense of self and there are a lot of discussions about emotions and managing them, something I didn’t get as much with cbt. And I’ve been there, school, and a friend group with the same dynamics. And I’m sorry about your family. That was always the stuff that hurt me most: reaching out to my loved ones and not being met with a lot of care or sensitivity. Sorry about your family’s reaction, that doesn’t sound like they really understand what you need in that moment. Also not trusting you enough to leave you alone when you do open up sounds pretty hurtful too. I’m sorry. I know I’ve had my share of failed understandings with my loved ones. 

I hope your appointments went well. I hope you have great day today/tomorrow as well. And of course!

Deep breath.

You need to vent a bit somewhere safe. Even the odd primal scream in the woods might make you feel a bit better, not a cure but it might take the steam out a bit.

Other than that you really need someone to talk to where any fear of hospitalisation isn't present. No friends that might be that non-judgemental ear? Depending on where you are there are also some good help lines or PTSD charities that might be a good ear too.

The ideation to end it? Of course, I might be taking a risk here but I see that as a normal part of the process of being you. It doesn't always last and is really driven by a deep desire to NOT be you and you can only say that because of the memories you have that are negative. Again completely understandable. Just be aware that it can spiral downwards as a repetitive thought. That's very exhausting to have those thoughts every time you feel triggered or down.

Here's one key that applies to people having too many thoughts creating a desire to control or suppress them. Suppressing them can be the problem more than those thoughts actually exist being the problem. The tremendous desire to suppress them is probably more exhausting than having the thoughts in the first place! In other words, those thoughts are stressful when you're inside of them. They seem real and valid. If you manage to find a moment of peace and suddenly those thoughts come, look at them as if they are just a machine working in your head to try and make yourself feel in control. Let it go. It's going to happen anyway. The thoughts will come, and they will go. Allow them to go even if they seem stubborn and are sticking around. Put them in a place where you realise they are not who you really are. They are like a machine kicking off when the on button has been pushed. Kind of like a knee jerk reaction of the brain. You can practice this every day just by being aware of it rather than trying to control it. Be aware of it but it's really just babble in the background.

There is another part of you that isn't this. A deep and relevant part that can access something else other than thinking about bad thoughts.

With the PTSD you can try some of the trusted and true methods that bring your attention to the things around you. When you feel yourself going into a PTSD mode do things like look at the walls and their colour. Describe the light in the room. Use sensing as a way to connect with the reality of where you are rather than the thoughts in your head. Run cold water over your hands is another good one. It focuses your brain on the relevant and immediate world.

You both need to have a serious conversation with each other and be real. Come up with a couples safety plan. Identify your love and fight languages. Get to know each other really. She needs to stop blocking you on everything and turning off location, etc. Splitting is not an excuse. I understand her reasoning for the behavior and struggled with it myself, but at the end of the day her reasoning is not relevant. She needs to stop, it’s abusive and harmful to you and will simultaneously fuel her own self hate. She needs to develop the skills to be able to handle her emotions in the moment and think rationally. Same with work and hysteria, you can’t save her. She has to want to get better. Have a plan around how to handle issues with work. 
Please have boundaries as well with your finances with her. Do not let her financially abuse you. She may not be doing these things consciously or intentionally but it’s still an issue. She needs to have her own income and be financially independent. Your financial situation can enable codependency and narcissistic behavior, do not let her completely rely on you. I struggle to maintain employment because of my symptoms but it is still my responsibility to find solutions and something I can do to survive. Any support financially that my partner offers is a gift, not an expectation. You are not a wallet for her or a backbone for her to ignore her issues and cope with avoidance and enmeshment. Especially if she is buying stuff often. And don’t view her in black or white either, it’s easy to in a relationship with someone with BPD, but don’t. Her behavior when splitting is still her behavior and just as much her responsibility as when she is sweet. She needs to own that. And an FYI, if she has not received treatment, it is likely that you setting boundaries will cause further splitting. I would discuss that prior to even setting boundaries and coming up with a plan to discuss these things with her. She has to be more dedicated to her healing than you are. If she needs anyone to talk to with BPD or how just wants to talk about symptoms or how to cope and handle things I am glad to help! You both would probably benefit from therapy, both individual and couple. She HAS to be in therapy or at least doing her own self work consistently in order for the relationship to last. BPD is fucking rough, If she is unwilling to love herself then she is incapable of loving you.

I’m no professional but I was a Psych double major for a year and a half so I can help quite a bit + research and reading but external help from a professional helps(since I’m a loved one I want to be the safe space for talking and letting out emotions rather than the solve problem first then feel emotions second).

It’s understandable to search for a label to try to get it fixed, however the label truly means nothing when it comes to recovery. Being diagnosed can sometimes make it worse and harder to find treatment because a lot of people don’t know how to treat/address bpd. I disagree with you on the freebies, we shouldn’t.

It sounds like you might need a different type of support in your life than what you currently have. (Easier said than done, I know...trust me I know.) I don't have any magic solutions, but here are some things that helped me at different times that could be helpful to look into, or hopefully even just distract you for a little while:
* Patrick Teahan is personally my favorite and has the most content. https://youtube.com/@patrickteahanlicswtherapy?si=xyLPH_H-FwQh8ZJS
* Dr. Kim Sage is very calming. https://youtube.com/@DrKimSage?si=I4UsdHF9AtueHxUe
* Dr. Fox is very practical, but sometimes his face bothers me, so I just listen to his stuff 😉
https://youtube.com/@DrDanielFox?si=ZnsBzlcWyJcbg1Uk
(All of them have content on other platforms as well.)
* If you struggle with self-harm, this is an alternative list of things to try to avoid self harming, and it is a loooooong list. https://projectlets.org/alternatives-to-selfharm
* This bpd sub has been particularly supportive and validating, and I encourage you to ""let it out"" here.
* Therapy/new therapist if you have access. Same with psychiatrist if you have comorbid issues that require meds. 

Also, I understand people have reactions, but out of concern for your health, I just want to say that your partner's reaction to noticing that you ""messed with their 'stuff'"" is concerning to hear. I don't hear concern for you in ""now I can't even keep these here"" - however, I do hear them shaming you in what was relayed. (I do think it's better the weapons aren't in the house for some time but that's it's own thing)...AND It's no wonder you're having a ""reaction"" and probably having trouble regulating. Sometimes people don't realize they speak a certain way toward others, and sometimes ""we"" don't pick up on it b/c often we've been conditioned to accept ""less than."" I just thought, based on your post, it might be a useful conversation for you and your partner to have or revisit when you felt comfortable so that maybe the next bad situation doesn't go from bad to worse. 😬 Shame and BPD don't generally mix well. 

I've struggled with mental health issues my whole life, been in therapy for 25 years - dozens of medication trials and various treatment modalities later I'm still sitting in a near constant state of wanting to die, too.

17tuobx,I’ve been diagnosed with Bpd 2 years ago. At that time I didn’t even know what bpd was but it took me one year of seeing the same psychiatrist and lots and lots of test until i got a diagnosis it’s definitely a process but it’s the right direction and it is worth it. My bpd was masked by my depression and severe anxiety which were the initial diagnosis i got from other psychiatrist. Ive been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for 2 years now and i can tell you it gets better. When you get a diagnosis they can help you with means that are specifically tailored to your needs and medication would help if you are considering them. And you don’t have to tell anyone or choose the right people to talk to about it unless you feel ready to avoid any negativity. I can’t say you will 100% feel better there are days where i feel like i am exactly the same or even worse and its a journey with lots of ups and downs. but overall it does get better over time and DBT is a great help you should consider. It takes consistency and effort and though it’s hard it will help you in your life. Consider talking to a psychiatrist about Bpd and make sure to be with a therapist you are comfortable with. Sorry for the long comment just wanted to share with you things i found helpful and my experience and i am here for you if you need to talk about anything 💜🫂.

Additionally, from personal experience, I can tell you with absolute assurance that BPD is just one is those labels that mental health professionals don't want to reveal to patients.

The diagnosis is hidden from the patient in an attempt to protect them from overthinking and spiralling.

DONT FORGET ABOUT WATER! Its so important! When I have about a 10 minute leeway from feeling really awful I fill up multiple bottles of water to take to my room with me, and I keep them around me so I can actually drink. Sometimes I even put them in the fridge, it’s just across the room where I live, so its like a nice fresh treat for me if I get up and stretch.

Keeping on top of dental hygiene is the hardest, I’m yet to find a fix, but sugarfree chewing gum is a semi helpful way to deal with feeling gross in your mouth for at least a day. You must really try to brush your teeth though. Don’t even worry about flossing or mouthwash, just make sure if you can you go and do your teeth.

In terms of bodily hygiene, wet wipes and deodorant are really helpful but you can’t rely on them to stay clean, you must try to shower as often as you can.

My hair stays up most of the time in a bun, and i brush it at least twice a day, once in the morning, once before bed. If you do this, try to use a looser/comfier hair tie, like a soft scrunchie, as to keep the strain off of your scalp.

Until i found a doctor that i really felt comfortable with and liked her so much.

17phs00,"So, I've always felt the insane emptiness that comes with BPD. I was in treatment last year for a combo of mental health/substance abuse issues. It was Christian-based and very freeing. For something to work for me, it's gotta be intense. I've been in a few programs before and had seen people laid out in the spirit. I wanted to experience that freedom so much. Of course a part of me thought it was all hooplah, but I didn't care. Just wanted to be free in whatever way would work. So while in treatment last year, A prophetic woman came one evening to minister over us. I had a feeling this was going to be special and forever change my beliefs. Towards the end of the service, I told myself just to go talk to her. As I was speaking to her, I mentioned my issues with chronic depression and oppression and in the blink of an eye, something happened. She grabbed my hands and we started hopping up and down happily repeating the word joy over and over and I began feeling my spirit smile (if that makes any kind of sense). Next she abruptly stopped and commanded whatever was causing my depression to come out. I then felt the inside of my stomach lunge forward and I fell back screaming as though something had left my body. Lastly, incredible peace. Afterward I spend the next 2 hours or so in a prayer closet speaking in tongues and feeling more heard and validated than I'd ever had in my life. Since then, I've had numerous encounters with the presence of the Holy Spirit. Maybe try an Apostolic church if you want an experience. Try some worship music and let it all go. The longer you sit and just be with the Lord (in whatever way works for you so you can really feel him),  the more peace will take over. Anyway, sorry.

I used to struggle a lot of suicidal tendencies, impulsive behavior and such but again, these are now thoughts that I sometimes have, but am able to control due to my medication. The medication gives me time to react and think about my decisions before I act on them. Before? I used to act then figure what the hell I needed to do to clean up the mess I made lol. I mention my struggles because I want you to know medication isn’t an end all be all, but it is 100% something I recommend to everyone considering getting on them especially pairing meds with DPT and CBT. It’s very helpful in the recovery process.

If you need help paying for meds, I do too, look at using apps like blinkhealth, goodRX, Cost Plus drugs, and even CVS has a discount card for medication. These services provide discounted prices for prescription medications. I’ve used all of them. 

Also, this is a bit of advice you didn’t ask for but from a person with BPD to another. Staying off of social media has given my life a whole new meaning.

17izfmj,"Hi, I recently had a conversation about how ADHD, autism and BPD can be DX together or separately.
I am AuDHD myself, my special person with ADHD & some other condition is figuring out if they are on the spectrum and or have BPD. And I am trying to help them through this, to find the right resources for this endeavor. 

BPD is different from autism as in:
- one could be irritated about a change of plans by the other person but the irritation would possibly stem in ASD from struggling to adapt to changes - whereas AFAIK with BPD it can trigger feeling abandoned/ fear of losing the FP

- in autistic people, there is no immediate fear triggered of  "" they don't love me, it's over"" and there would be no splitting 

- autistic people  without BPD can experience meltdowns or shutdowns when something doesn't make logical sense, when there is sensory overload, when it's hard to process something emotionally, when expectations aren't met, but it's usually regardless of a relationship, it's outside of relationship dynamics 

- during a meltdown, emotions can run high in autistic people in conjunction with the nervous system going haywire but during a shutdown it's polar opposite to the point of going non-verbal. The thought process during these moments is different from non-autistic  people suffering from BPD and splitting 

- autistic people can enjoy time alone, they actually need the space / their own bubble for regeneration and in that time there is a high chance they don't think of their partner no matter how much they love them 
- autistic people can break up relationships without going through extreme emotions during it 
- autistic people even with ADHD can be perceived as emotionally cold due to alexithymia / monotone voice / delayed cognitive processing of events & emotions/ - which I think is polar opposite to BPD 
- BPD come across as loving, full of feelings, dedicated, intense 
- it's ""thinkings"" in autistic people vs ""feelings"" in neurodiverse people 
- the internal experience for people with BPD is different from the internal experience for people who are autistic 
- one is born autistic but not with BPD. 
BPD is aquired due to traumatic life experiences 
- the executive functioning is usually impaired in autistic people 
- BPD is a treatable mental illness to the point of not fulfilling the DX criteria after getting help for it whereas autism is always there 

- autism has a biological base, the brain structure is different from people who are not autistic 
- autism means monotropism & bottom up thinking, a different way to perceive the world 
- autistic people with BPD would think bottom up vs non-autistic people with BPD who think top-down 
- autistic people without BPD can trust a loved one immediately, it's a tendency to be gullible and naive whereas non-autistic people with BPD  struggle with trust 

FYI Some of this info is from the book ""Unmasking autism"" by Devon Price.

It's ASD = a product of genes / nature 
vs
 BPD = a nurture / result of environmental factors,  traumatic experiences, lack of positive experiences,

There is also a possibility that ADHD vs hyper vigilance / sensory issues due to traumatic experiences have to be differentiated. 

AFAIK, the latter once can be treated with therapy vs lack dopamine in ADHD without traumatic experiences. 


Logically speaking, it's possible to be AuDHD or ADHD & BPD or AuDHD with BPD.",lostinspace80s,False,1715118906.0

But this in fact clears the mind. In the beginning of my practice, I found this to be a good approach and still do.

Meditation is (in principle) simple: You just have to sit. 

Normally, we have trouble to be still. We grasp onto thoughts that come; into ideas avout what we should be doing (be it while meditating or in our lives in general); what will come next, what happened yesterday etc. Thus, we have open the proverbial ""hand of thought"" that grasps onto these things, fo let them go. This will enable these things to beas they are in themselves, not as the images we try to make them into.

Saying that zazen, or meditation, is good for nothing is a warning. Ultimately, meditation is not done for some goal but for its own sake. Paradoxically, only then can meditation be benificial.

171nkeh,"Hi I’m 37 and have been living with BPD most of my life. Properly diagnosed when I was 24. First off, people with BPD can absolutely be good even amazing partners. We just have to work extra hard on our end to stay constantly aware of ourselves and how we perceive whatever current situation we are facing that is triggering us. The best possible skill you can learn is respect boundaries both your own and the boundaries of others. For us, a lot of it comes down to communication. How we convey and receive to and from our loved ones. We have to work extra hard to remind ourselves that we need to trust and know our partners love us. And on their end they have to also be willing to stay healthy and regulated as well as taking part in either personal or group therapy. The truth is… we are a tall order. But we also, have the innate skill to love… if we remind ourselves why we are doing this, it’s all out of love.
I myself am entrenched in a battle that is slowly degrading my partners will to keep going. 
I’ve decided to take space after a big blow up. 
(This included splitting, devaluing, and the eventual “break up” talk) and I’ve been doing my best to calm myself physically and mentally while I let the emotions run it’s course. Im trying to be more observant rather than reactive. But I know deep down somewhere… im losing someone I truly love and care about… I honestly would not have revisited this BPD if it wasn’t for her. 
In that, makes her a great partner. But we are doing our best to keep ourselves healthy. And that comes first. Everything else, let them lay as they fall. And be ok in knowing you will be ok. Let it hurt. But do no harm.",Maximum_Primary6940,False,1696775783.0

Also Asperger’s is a really outdated term for autism, they’re the same thing except the term Asperger’s has nazi origins (look it up). The autistic community doesn’t use it anymore",Demonderus,False,1696614489.0
171hqaj,"I too am in a relationship with a person who has autism so I have had to think about similar stuff a lot. Here are some conclusions I've come to. You may know them already and they might not be helpful to you. 

First of all, where does the feeling of emotional come from? People with autism often have difficulties with things we find ""normal"" in a relationship, but the question is, are they actually ""normal""? Or at least, why do we think they are normal? The point in such questions is to show that there are different ways of showing affection, and I'm not speaking about the so-called ""love languages"", but rather about the fact that neurodivergent people (people with autism and/or ADHD) just in general communicate differently than neurotypicals. For example, neurodivergent people might have a ""flat affect"", which means a flat tone of voice or/and a flat facial expression. There is nothing wrong in this nor does it express that something is wrong, it just is a different way of communating.

This different communication also includes how one shows affection. So, for example, if I expect my partner to show affection in a certain way, I might be expecting something that she would have to pretend, and I don't want her to pretend to show affection in a certain way just so that I'm happy. Because more often than not, this pretending will make her unhappy. But if I let her to show affection in the way she finds natural, she will come up with the most sweet and caring stuff, which all are natural to her. How could I not want and respect that?

Secondly, I've had to learn to grow self-confidence. My partner will not pick up subtle hints about my feelings or needs, I have to be direct with these. And even then, the above is still the case: She might not answer to my needs and feelings ""normally"", ie. in a way I would expect, but in her own way. Additionally, I have to have the self-confidence to put up my own boundaries. So I can't sacrifice myself for my partner, or always put myself before her. 

In general, being in a relationship with a person with autism might become one-sided if one isn't clear about your boundaries or if one expects something from one's partner which is not natural to her. Further, a relationship with a person with autism can be one-sided in the sense that the person who is neurotypical often becomes the main support for the person with autism since she has to navigate what is essentially an alien social reality to her. 

Hope these are at least of some help to you. Still, even saying all of the above, it might be, as the other commentator said, that your partner really is not there for you emotionally. But perhaps you can ponder your problem through the above. Feel free to ask anything more if you want to!

I hope you find the right way forward 🙏",Hour_Tomatillo8730,False,1696619897.0

So not only are you having to care for a little human and teach them how to be the best they can be, you’re having to teach yourself these things too. And some days, it’s so hard not to emotionally react or react to things in a negative way, but you have to remember to apologize to your kids when you do, even if they are little bitty and explain why it was wrong. I also get SUPER overstimulated relatively quickly, so some days are absolutely draining and it feels like my kids are attacking me and my mental (kids are just really fuckin good at knowing how to press your buttons).

I absolutely get manic for long period of time (since April). Before that I was in a hefty depressive episode for nearly a year. I have had another conversation with my psychiatrist and essentially it could be either one, or both. I think I probably have both, and I’ve seen both the sustained ups and downs in bipolar, as well as the more acute mood swings in BPD within myself. I have the BPD symptoms mostly under control due to DBT, and I was just concerned about my psychiatrist not seeing the damaging behaviours from my “up” state (lack of sleep, increase in energy, talking too much, obsessing over topics, lack of empathy, taking on a lot of tasks both in my personal and professional life, hypersexual, impulsive in spending reckless driving etc, and generally super euphoric but I can get irritable when I feel “slowed down” as I’m basically like the energizer bunny on coke LOL). Regardless, my psychiatrist reassured me that we’re continuing mood stabilizers and antipsychotics which seem to be helping more and more with the dosage increase!

Edit: I forgot to add that my psych and I agreed last appointment that I do have psychosis, in terms of both vivid hallucinations and delusions of grandeur.

Share it as your feelings are bogging you down and you know it's probably not true, but while he be willing to to reassure you that he does miss you and things are good between yall? 

But don't expect a normal person to want to validate that negative cognitive distortion often. If you do trust him, you'll listen and believe he does miss you and it's only you. Write it down, look at it often, whatever it takes, but those are intrusive thoughts that will torture us. 

You in therapy yet? I'll save you a lil trouble, you need a personality disorder specialist and more specifically Dialectical Behavior Therapy. And i take a mood stabilizer, and and i personally think you should take up journaling. 

 I hope i didn't come off harshly. I don't mean to. But really,  i suggest i feel is like your only option. You don't want to be nagging or begging or scaring off the guy. Interpersonal relationships don't usually come easily to us. Message me if you like.

It often ends up making a conflict anyway, and the real solution is expressing your feelings in a purposeful and mindful way to lead to better communication and open dialogue. i understand this is easier said than done, but practice meditation. this can help you learn to view your emotions as external sources, that you don’t have to drown in. you can view them and analyze them, without being inside them. you can allow them to pass, and handle things more clearly. mindfulness gets easier the more you practice it. i hope this helps. best of luck. xx

I do have a dissociative disorder along with BPD and my therapist used that to see what symptoms were effecting my life the worst and how to help me the best. Dissocation can effect your life pretty severely and they are probably just trying to help you.

It scores for three things and each specific questions shows the specific they effect you. Amnesia which is pretty self explanatory, as well as depersonalization and derealization which is a disconnection from your sense of self/connection to reality, and last absorption factor which basically feeling like you loose yourself in things like watching shows or doing a task.

It’s simply because of insight & education. I know enough to be hyper-aware of when my thoughts and actions are “very bpd” but I can’t cure myself, I can only know what’s happening to me and why. 
It doesn’t mean I can stop feeling what I feel.

The thing that actually helped me while practicing CBT and DBT is keeping myself busy, especially with the right and most beneficial things:

Consider trying out different hobbbies, even if you think you might lose interest in them later on. You can always try something new.

Try working out, or just joining classes like Pilates or spinning once a week at first .

Something i can also suggest is taking free online courses on topics that pique your curiosity can be incredibly rewarding and can be added to your CV.

One thing i do personally is that I make it a point to research any topic that catches my attention or that I'm not well-informed about. It could be as simple as looking up word definitions or diving into a whole study on a planet i once heard about in a tiktok video .

And when it comes to doing things solo, I recommend giving it a shot. Eating out alone can be a surprisingly enjoyable experience.

Pet sitting can also be a nice experience.

This used to make me feel like they didn't want to talk to me, or that they were mad at me for some unknown reason. I would work myself up si much about it to the point of hysterics, too. (It's definitely not embarrassing because most of us can probably relate to you lol.) What I find comfort in is knowing that some people just don't like to communicate verbally about things that are wrong. It has nothing to do with you, or how strong y'alls relationship is, but more of how their brain deals with stress/trauma/negativity. Just like how with BPD, we tend to share EVERYTHING at the exact moment it happens. People just differ. I promise it has nothing to do with you <3

It is extremely hard to talk yourself out of a spiral, especially when it revolves about your FP. The best thing you can do, however hard, is let your partner have their space. You can have a discussion with them on what they would like you to do when they are upset. Even if it's just a ""Hey, when I need space, I'll let you know that I do and update you every hour.""

I do shit like compulsively pluck my eyebrows when I'm not using. So we want to be sober, healthy and independent, all the good progress you've made, it's still there, you accomplished things okay, you might be down playing it too a degree and focusing on only the negative. But, you are codependent like I am, and I took all obsessed with my fiance. We have a very healthy relationship tho, has boundaries and always checks in with me to keep me in the know. Like everything. Maybe if yours was willing to do that more and tell you ahead of time about things hes even considering doing you might take it better. Do you have a pet to cuddle? That might help. My therapist has said the best with this we can do is keep my self care at 110 percent. Like everything from diet, journaling, exercising, tooth care, sobriety, making my medications on time and shit like that, PLUS writing down a list of my accomplishments then adding to it daily. Things like taking a shower count okay. If you get the balls up to actually take a shower, brush your teeth and put on face cream.... That's an accomplishment bc if your like me you don't really feel like it. So knowing you can so more than you think, and it's tangibly down on paper like that's something you read, and touch and know it's real and that to me it's comforting.

15jruni,"It feels very isolating and the fear of losing friends alone can cause us to withdraw. People want to see behavioral changes to show respect of them and an effort to work on our personal things that impact them by being in relationship with us.

I did have some help from DBT treatment. The main, first thing to know is that we can experience intense levels of situational distress that triggers our vagus nerve and we won’t be able to think or communicate clearly until it’s calmed down. This is something happening in your body, it’s why you can feel possessed by an unhinged energy and then be completely apologetic afterward. Try to notice the signs in your body of feeling increased intensity/distress. If you can inform others it’s happening and that you need to take a break to calm back down, then your friends can help by being respectful of that and giving you your space. There are techniques that can help calm your vagus nerve back down. They include breathing techniques, using hot/cold temperatures, intense exercise, etc. It takes a lot of practice to get good at identifying your distress going up before snapping, it takes a lot of practice to get good at calming down, and also communicating effectively. The more you can seek guidance on those skills, the more you can tell your friends how they can support you in practicing them, the more people who are truly there for you can be in a way that’s healthy for everyone. Part of that process is your friends having boundaries for what they won’t tolerate in outbursts etc, and it’s your job to find the skills to use to prevent things from getting to that point where those mean behaviors come out to communicate. Find the sweeter voice that needs to be seen/heard and try to communicate from there before the harsher one comes out to protect you.

It helped me realize I am not alone, I hate my boyfriend and that I have codependency issues. I was blessed enough to be given a copy of CODEPENDENT NO MORE at an AA meeting.  Very good read, had a test at the beginning to see if you think you are codependent and then the book tells you how to handle it. Both helped me accept my diagnosis as I was scared shitless to have a Cluster B Personality Disorder. Fortunately enough it's the most treatable of the PD and DBT (DIALECTICAL BEHAVIORAL THERAPY), a similar approach to CBT ( COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY), but with mindfulness and meditation added. DBT s created to treat BPD directly and I'll say it works if your work it. I have a very good therapist. They say that Borderlines are the most likely to go for help as we desperately want to stop the suffering. Now a days I'm deep into my therapy, I go weekly, take medications for my co-morbid ( or CO-occuring) disorders like ADHD, OCD, MAD, GAD and traits of Bipolar. I believe I was improperly diagnosed Bipolar II before BPD. This happens to alot of us. One girls OLD videos on YouTube helped me relate, Sammy Grimm. And now I listen to any MedCircle info I can get my hand on. Also on YouTube is Dr. Fox (PD expert focusing on BPD), and the HEALTHYGAMERGG. I do short, guided meditations on YouTube as well, I use THE HONEST GUYS. Esp @ bed time. Also Binaural Beats. 

But back to your question here, the book was very helpful to me and I suggest it to any BPD person, male or female. I've also joined all the Cluster B sub's, NPD, HPD, SPD as well bc it's easy to share traits. Dr. Ramani can be found through MedCircle, here and on YouTube speaking about Narcissistic PD alot. I find it very interesting bc I don't want to give that manipulative vibe. I learned about gaslighting and have in the past been very guilty of this. I've learned about lying, it's basically controlling someone else's reality to self preserve. But I'm no more important or deserving then the next and that's not fair just bc I'm good at it. That's gross fr. 

I have a FP (Favorite Person), we are engaged and have a very healthy relationship where I do not devalue him and realize he is just s human being and not to be put on a pedestal. He wants what's best for me and helped me stop driving recklessly, acknowledge my substance abuse, stop stealing, cheating and being so impulsive. Got to take time to think about consequences for the next 48 hours before doing any of these things. I think I'm even ready to go back to work when our son goes back tho school. I have a sheet for IF I FEEL LIKE USING.... and a sheet for IF I FEEL LIKE KILLING MYSELF RN.... They have helped allot. I once kept a suicide kit. But I'm too impulsive for this and got rid of it. 😐

I realize you didn't ask for all this but I talk alot, too much really, and couldn't stop myself here. Hope something helps you. 

The DSM-V will give you the 9 traits of BPD.
I have pre BPD😭, all 9.

You have to begin trying to understand who you are and what you want out of life OUTSIDE of relationships with others. It's going to be a long time before you're comfortable with yourself. But it WILL be worth it. Trust us. Everyone here has been on the horrible side of BPD where you feel you have nothing and no point to live. So you are not alone here. But also everyone who makes it to the other side wishes they had done certain things sooner, trusted in themselves sooner, loved themselves sooner.

Now, You are in emotional brain, right now the best thing is to figure out how to stall emotional brain and to keep yourself stable. What does that mean? Meditation, breathing, go for walks, exercise, read a boring factual retelling of something, get your logic brain working. Once it kicks in it'l be easier to be stable. But please be careful right now, you're fresh, you're wounded, you're raw, you're vulnerable. Now is the time when other predators can come in and do some further horrible damage to you without you realizing it. Protect yourself. Love yourself. Treat yourself well. Patience. You will make it.",suberdoo,False,1690827832.0

I decided to just cut contact altogether since I don't want to allow myself to run havoc to my ex's life.

155s9u8,"I must admit that I don't know what it's like to be a mother. However, I can offer advice from the perspective of a daughter, even though I was diagnosed late in life. What would have made a difference for me, besides an early diagnosis, would have been having my parents' understanding and seeing their willingness to learn. Perhaps if they had spoken with me and reassured me that they were there for me, even during my rebellious teenage years, things would have been different, and I would have felt supported.  
  
On the contrary, I had dysfunctional parents who constantly fought and yelled, a mother who lived in her own world, and an absent father. Being present for your daughter is crucial, and I understand it may be difficult when she goes through episodes due to her disorder. However, it's important to remember that she has no control over it right now, and the pain she feels is immeasurable. When something happens, just listen to her and remind yourself, ""My daughter is not herself right now."" Nonetheless, it's essential to set boundaries as part of our learning and growth process.

Defense mechanisms are innate in all of us, and they serve a very important purpose: to protect us from significant emotional pain or physical pain. I like to imagine many of the common defense mechanisms as a sort of brick wall that goes up and when we're behind that wall, we feel safe. The defense mechanism of ""splitting"" refers to the polarization of perceiving oneself or others as ""all good"" or ""all bad"" with no in between. This defense mechanism is commonly activated to protect us from emotionally painful experiences related to anticipated or perceived abandonment. The brick wall goes up to protect us from that pain and we shift our perception of the person we anticipate as abandoning us to ""all bad"" and devalue them (Ex: ""I actually never cared about this person; they suck; I hate everything about them; etc.).

Don’t beat yourself up for being this way. This is activating a pattern in you that developed for a reason and that has an intrinsic logic. So try to validate and accept that part of you instead of berating yourself. 

Relationships are incredibly tough when you have BPD so give yourself credit for how well you are handling this so far. 

Be extra extra mindful of your feelings, impulses, and behaviours. Try writing them down to create some distance and not spiral into them. If you use DBT skills, something like a chain analysis could be useful here.

14kihty,"I have been in such a similar situation, and I really feel for you. It’s so frustrating. I hope this does not end up being a repeat of things you’ve already read online. 

TLDR: Giving yourself the time and space to reflect through whatever healthy outlet works for you (exercise, art, journaling, utilize DBT skills). The answer will come eventually. 

My current partner knows about my BPD and I am very grateful for how patient and caring they are. By no means are we perfect, but combining traits like theirs with earnest efforts of self improvement and healthy communication are what I have found to be the key for myself at least. 

I am not sure what is possibly triggering these moments of splitting for you, but figuring that out is definitely a great start! 
What I personally do is force myself to actively step back from the situation. When I recognize that I’ve been triggered and am beginning to split or spiral, I switch to a different activity from whatever I was doing (walk, gym, video games, etc) to help start regulating my system back down. This is usually accompanied with or followed by journaling/DBT self-regulation activities. By writing things down first, I can read it and reflect on it, making sure it’s not acting on impulse (I’m a visual person and working things out in my head just keeps the spiral going). 

Hopefully by putting some space between thoughts and actions, as it seems you are trying to do, things become a little more clear. 

Personally, I notice I begin to split on my partner more often/severely when we spend a lot of consecutive time together. While I don’t know the details of your relationship, it can be something to explore! It can be painful, but in a similar vein as the journaling, sometimes a little bit of space between you and your partner can help. Even if it’s just a week/weekend to collect your thoughts or simply have a mental reset. 
Specifically speaking to being unsure of breaking up, it can give you the opportunity to reflect on your individual actions, how they interact, and finding the healthiest path whether that be breaking up or staying together, and what that would look like.

Remember, it’s so so important to be patient and kind to yourself through it all.

14jq1j9,"I’ve been recently diagnosed with BPD also. I actually suspected that I had BPD for a long time and it was a bit of a process to actually get a diagnosis. Because it took so long, I thought that I had come to an acceptance of my diagnosis already. 

But since I’ve gotten officially diagnosed, it’s all kind of hit me. BPD is a really heavy diagnosis. It’s difficult to know that some of your thinking is warped and faulty. It’s difficult to know that BPD is hard to treat and it might take awhile to get better. It’s difficult to hear just how painful BPD can be (although this can be validating at times). 

So I can say I’ve been going through a similar feeling. I’ve been feeling pretty guilty since my diagnosis and as if I’m a crazy person. I feel like I have nothing good to offer and that I’m going to destroy every good relationship that I get into. Also, since my diagnosis, I’ve started to see things that I did in my past that were definitely a result of BPD, but I just didn’t know it at the time.

14jq1j9,"I'm sorry you're experiencing these feelings, but please know those loops are common - and both possible AND important (although difficult) to break. 

It's realistic, understandable, and okay to be unhappy with your behaviors when dealing with BPD. But with knowledge, practice, consistency, and time, those behaviors can and will change. All of the things about yourself that are bothering you and making you feel less-than, and that people have likely also made you feel less-than for, do not define you. Lacking a sense of self is common with BPD, but you do have a core self, and you can heal and change all of the other parts in time. 

It's hard to deal with a diagnosis, but I think knowing is better as long as you don't give into all the misinformation and stigma there is. I was misdiagnosed until I figured it out myself at 28, and the invalidation that came from not being able to recover with medicine or CBT and being told essentially that I'm just too hard on myself and didn't have reason to feel how I felt, was very damaging.  There is a valid reason you are the way you are, there are effective treatments, and it's totally possible for you to get better, learn to love yourself, and create a life worth living.

14h1jz1,"I know how you feel. I've felt different most of my life. People generally treat me the same. Most people though just don't understand what our condition is or what we go through in our heads. Most people may try to help with certain situations but fail miserably at understanding, no matter how hard you try to explain, how you see or feel about things. But that's why communication is important. If they're willing to attempt to understand, I would try to explain it until they can at least understand even a little bit. 

Before being officially diagnosed I studied my symptoms starting back in middle school. My now deceased wife (passed of cancer) helped me a lot. She saw me at my absolute worst and still chose to be with me. I was able to talk to her about anything. It got to a point she'd be able to detect one of ""outbursts"" before it happened and helped me through. I learned a lot of coping skills and am a lot calmer of a person because of her. Currently, I have one friend I trust enough to talk to. 

If you have someone you can trust, my advise is talk to them about things. Even if all they do is listen. It helps. I've also found that being open about my condition helps me and helps others understand me. So I've recently started a podcast where I talk about my life and different situations I've been through as well as how I feel about certain topics. Even if I never grow an audience I'll continue doing the podcast because it's a way for me to get things off my chest (vent) and I'll be able to listen to episodes in the future to see how much I've changed compared to when I spoke about a situation and how I might handle it differently as opposed to when I went through it. 

I chose podcasting on purpose because I feel a blog would gain an audience faster, and whereas I do want to talk about it and put it out there, part of me is still a bit scared or nervous about how some people may view what I say. But either way, it's an outlet for me to relieve my stresses and vent; which does help.",RedConradcom,False,1687545926.0
14h1jz1,"Hey, no matter what your symptoms and experience - you aren't alone! Remember that. 

BPD is complex, and every case is uniquely formed and expressed. People - including doctors - would often downplay my mental illness because I'm more of the ""quiet"" subtype with a high functioning presentation. It was misdiagnosed for many years because of that in combination with my not having an obvious history of abuse. But trauma is much more complicated than that. Having our mental illness and experience invalidated of course contributes to the overall issue.

If you meet the criteria, or even some of the symptoms that severely affect you, then they need to be addressed no matter what anyone thinks. No matter your situation, yes, your brain HAS been wired a certain way by your environment and experiences. And it can be rewired in time. DBT is a great place to start - if you can't do it formally, there are many books and resources online. I'd also highly recommend Dr. Daniel Fox's YouTube channel, as well as his Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook. His workbook is pretty unique compared to other ones out there; it's my favorite one I've come across. I'm going to be starting my own channel soon, but more for the peer support side and to share my personal experience with BPD and recovery - I'm not a doctor or licensed in any way and will still suggest there that people refer to his content for clinical information.

BPD is an isolating experience, but that's why peer support is so important. I haven't felt understood regarding the strength of my emotions by anyone in life besides those with similar issues. Keep reaching out. BUT be wary about info you come across, even within this subreddit. There are so many misconceptions, and they can be harmful to recovery. Have hope.

My conclusions arent always rooted in reality and I know this. I would love help with bridging the gap between my perception of reality, and what is actually going on."" Or something like ""When I gave up on myself in this relationship i feel like that is when you started to love me more. Is that true?

14f2789,"It’s hard. Constantly trying to figure out how you’re coming off to people and what they think. My best advice; Do NOT assume what people are thinking UNLESS if they tell you. Assuming makes an endless cycle of “what ifs” or “do they hate me” or “am i coming off a certain way. Really step back from doing this. 

Second advice: 

When someone tells you something, believe it. I do feel a lot of people who suffer from BPD have a tendency to not trust others entirely. Either past traumas or fight-or-flight kick in. I encourage you to really take the advice people give you and go off of that. If you truly do feel that someone isn’t telling the truth, ask. If they care, they’d be able to talk to you about it.

Third advice: Time.

For me, time is quite convoluted and minutes can feel like hours (it’s prob the adhd haha) If someone doesn’t text you back in a timely manner or you have to wait. Remain calm and try to do some meditation. Put the phone down; distract yourself with something that can either help time go by or practice a hobby you’ve been putting off for some time. 

Don’t forget that you feel immensely, and your feelings should never be discarded. Remember that these feelings shall pass, and with effective skills and grounding can surely help you through this.

I also had a similar experience and know even tho I'm overweight cause of medication and other factors, I try not to blame myself, to put my mental health as a priority and to always be sincere with my therapist so we can work about that insecurities.

130c603,"Actually what you've experienced is quite common. Deep listening isn't a skill that most of us are taught. Some people have the ability to ""hold space"" for others, and some do not.   


It gets worse when the world around us isn't helpful. For instance, when you went to report that predator to law enforcement. It's VERY common for law enforcement to invalidate people, even when there is evidence of a crime. I was assaulted 2 years ago at a grocery store by a woman I didn't know. It was a big deal because a fight broke out and store employees surrounded us. The police were called automatically and we could not leave. The first thing the officer said to me was ""This isn't how adults behave."" and shook his head at me. But I wasn't the one who assaulted me, she was!   
Or the other numerous times I've had to deal with police for one reason or another. It's so toxic that I simply don't report on some things I should, because the trauma was bad enough but them invalidating it is even worse. 

I don't know if you live in the states but I do. Here it's so sickeningly common to ""blame the victim"". In the states if you open up or are vulnerable in any way, it almost seems like someones instinct is to invalidate you. Or get obviously uncomfortable. Or give bad advice because they think it's going to help you, but they don't even take time to listen to the whole story.  


It's also true that people in general lack emotional intelligence and that deep listening isn't commonplace. It's rare to find someone who compassionately understands and wants to hear us out.  


So then you add BPD into the mix. It's a common theme (written in the literature too) that people who develop BPD were often invalidated A LOT by their caregivers beginning at a young age. This is traumatic for many people...who then go on to develop this disorder in part because no one ever listened. Or taught us how to listen to ourselves.  


So there's a way I've learned to deal with this. I listen to myself more. If i've had a particularly rough day and felt invalidated by person/place/situation.... I take some time to think about it. I lay on my bed on my back and do some breathing exercises. Then I talk to myself outloud about the situation/person that I feel invalidated me. I allow myself to go through the painful emotions again. Then I once again talk to myself outloud, and tell myself this:  


""This really happened to me today. It made me feel horrible. I felt like nobody cared. I feel like nobody cares. But I care about myself, and I know this happened. It dosen't matter what someone else says...because I know how it made me feel. It's okay to feel horrible, even if it's not comfortable"" something to this effect. I keep repeating it over and over until I calm down. It can take a while.   


Something a therapist said to me once...If all you have is yourself in this life, at least you are not alone. If the only pillar of support you have is yourself, then you can build an entire house around it. You are the best support system you have.   


She also said that when someone comes around who truly gets it...who truly gets you..thats a rare find and to hold onto it for dear life.   


I definitely have a need to be heard and understood just like you do. We all do. And it's sad that we don't always get that from life. But I have learned to appreciate the fact that I believe myself. That I can be there for myself when others cannot. If you practice this enough by the way..you turn into that person for others too.   


You don't need to ask for permission to finish talking, you just finish talking. Because I believe you are worth listening to. You don't need to apologize for feeling hurt because...we all feel hurt. Nearly every one of us feels pain and emotion. Not everyone shows it to the world but they DO feel it.

130c603,"Hey and I just wanted to add. That I didn't mean to invalidate you by saying what my therapist said...about only having yourself as a support system.

So while it is possible to survive and thrive without other people, its a natural human need  that can't be overlooked. She also explained that loneliness for this reason is quite commn and that many people feel alone and unsupported.   


Again I'm just over here rooting for you. Because it's AWESOME that you were able to talk about this so openly on here. It's a healthy behavior to address these feelings you're having and write them out. It gets harder when we hold it all inside and then it comes pouring over like a volcano.

Ask him how he feels and why he was pushing back the time he’s going to see you. Tell him how you feel, don’t accuse him of anything or tell him how he feels.

i used to feel like this all the time with her throughout high school, i turn 20 this year and i’ve worked extremely hard on dealing with this feeling, it takes a lot of just sitting down and telling myself that i’m wayy in my head. i don’t really get fps anymore but when im romantically interested in someone i get the same angry feeling when they dont pay attention to me, or when i know they did something with someone else. just kind of have to get through emotional object permanence and remind yourself as much as possible that they still love you, and they could also have a life outside of your friendship

ironically i’ve had my best friend help me hammer it into my head that my previous love interest still loved me, maybe you could ask your fp for a quick way to reassure they love you? like “hey, i dont feel so good right now, could you reassure me etc.” kind of like a routine maybe?

113ebb1,"It seems like you are invalidating yourself. The things that happen to you might not be objectively as deep, but as people with BPD our brains are wired differently. We feel emotions much more intensely than everyone else. So whenever a situation brings up difficult emotions, it's not that we overreact, we react in accordance to their intensity. And since for us this intensity is very very high, from the outside it might seem like overreacting.

I know it is difficult, but in these moments, try to pause and truly feel your feelings. Not only in your mind, but your body too. Take a few deep breaths. Where do they come from? What situation made you react this way? Be mindful and accepting of your experience. 

For me, it helps (if there's other people involved) to come back to these moments later and try to distance myself while replaying the scenario. This means, you visualize the situation, step by step, but from a bird's eye perspective, without getting too involved emotionally. See what I do, and what the other person does. In case of BPD it's helpful to drag out the visualization of the situation, since in our case emotions will drag on for a longer time. So even if you and the other person parted ways, see yourself still being angry, while simultaneously imagine them going on about their business not long after the event.

1019evr,"Hey! 
First of all I have BPD, I had an extreme episode last year. I’m 21 and I grew up in a traumatic environment with neglectful parents, drugs exposure and simply no affection. 
So I COMPLETELY understand. I am you. I have been you. 
Please feel free to message me at any point! I am always open. For anything!



Secondly- it’s okay! You are still here and that’s what matters. You don’t need people yelling at you for these things. I used to self harm frequently. And no body understood. It feels like a wave of emotion taking over you. You can’t control your own actions. You just make impulsive decisions. So don’t blame yourself because this is common for people with BPD. 
You should be proud that you stopped and that you are still here. 
It’s always best NOT to harm yourself like this . It’s not the best option and honestly it will never ever help. You may feel a moment of relief- but it follows with guilt and regret and it isn’t worth it. 

Depending on age I don’t know what to suggest for your family/ friends that you mentioned are abandoning you. I feel you there. It’s a horrible feeling. Your family are the people that should be there for you the most and it’s heart breaking when it isn’t that way. But there will be or there is people out there that will love you and accept for who you are. 
You are never alone. There are always other options and you need to find a  mechanism that works best for you safely and without harming yourself. 

Personally I tried multiple things- including self harm in different forms- none of which helped. I tried arts and crafts, music, going for walks, laying down and breathing slowly and deeply, video games to take any anger out on animated people instead 🤣

1019evr,"Sorry for my long response. 

My last episode lasted around 4 months. I had broken up with my bf of 4 years (which was for the best) but it made me a single mum at 17 and it hit me hard. 
I reconnect with an ex and we got closer. But I wasn’t in the right head space and I didn’t know who/what I want. I kept changing my mind, pushing people away and then bringing them back over and over again. Saying horrible things I never usually would. 
I had no empathy for the people I was hurting. I was self harming again and I didn’t have anything under control emotionally. 
I hurt both my BD (and serious strained our relationship at parents) and my new relationship. I even fell pregnant during this time. It sent me over the edge and I lost all emotion. All feeling and all care in the world. I really didn’t care about anything or anyone apart from my daughter. 

I decided to have an abortion. I didn’t even process it beforehand. I made the appointment and I went. Numb and not feeling emotion- as heartless as it sounds- made it easier on the day. I went alone so I didn’t have to talk about my ‘feelings’
But once it was over and I made it home, i regretted it. 
I felt everything single emotion X1000. I had panic attacks over and over again, I cried, I screamed. It was an full emotional breakdown. I couldn’t believe what I had done and all the damage I did to so many people that I cared about. It was like I just woke up and gained control of my feelings. 

I had to face a lot and fix a lot of my damage. I don’t feel bad for myself for this. I deserved every hard thing I had to do to fix the problems I caused. 
I did it. It got better. And I pulled myself out from that very dark place. I stopped self harming, I fixed my new relationship and are currently on year 3 together. I fixed my relationship with my BD and now we co-parent but there are still a few issues there (not because of this incident though) 

It was hard but I accepted it was out of my control. 
I know these things aren’t my fault entirely, they would never happen if I didn’t have BPD. 
My BPD is a result of other people treating me poorly throughout my entire life. And I have to fight myself every day just to survive because of those people. 
But it is my life and I can take control of it. Just because other people harmed me and my life- doesn’t mean I have to continue the cycle. 
I don’t deserve pain and neither does anyone that has this condition. We don’t mean to cause pain. We don’t mean to take you on a emotional rollercoaster with us, we are just trying to process emotions that we never learned to process.

BPD is different for everyone but for me personally- I have a mental break down. I will cry and scream and feel everything that I haven’t felt for a while because I have shut off to everything. 
That night is the worst. But I make it. Every single time. 
I call her Lucy. She’s me…but she isn’t me. She’s got control over me and my reactions and emotions. It’s how I picture my BPD. Some people might think it’s silly. 
I know me and Lucy are the same people ofc. I’m not stupid. And when out of an episode I take responsibility of everything ‘Lucy’ has done. But it’s better to picture that way so I know that I am not a bad person. I just have no control sometimes, she does. 🤣

ywe7vy,"I see you and I can somewhat relate. It used to be rather severe - the rage and depressive episodes consuming me because of triggers which reminded me of my perception that I have no control and these cycles keep perpetuating.

DBT is helpful but also it is all so super exhausting, that conscious constant continous inner fight. Sometimes I just want to be and sometimes I just be for 2 days too longs and then spiral with letting go of each thing and just never getting back up in weeks or months.

It now comes in for a day or two and I can recognize the early early signs. Once I do or my healthy support structure reminds me of certain things we've written down that happens, I begin to increase my selfcare practices.

Especially two things. HRB and Neurographica. They require very little effort from me and they both make a physiological difference.

I have a free app for the Heart Rhythm Breathing, so all I do is place my finger on the camera and follow the ball inflation and deflation which assists me in breathing Rhythmically. That changes my coherence, makes the nervous system counter the cortisol production. If I am declining, I fit in 4 to 5 sessions of 10 to 20 minutes in just lying down on the grass or bed whoever you are able to or sit anywhere and breath through a session focusing on getting my breathing in Rhythm.

It also shows you your HRV (Heart rate variability) scores which can tell you how depressed and far gone you are and will start picking up the deeper you're able to hold your Rhythms.

Check out Dr Alan Watkins he explains about HRV Rhythm breathing and coherence with regards to performance, but it can be used like this.

Neurographica is also absolutely wonderful and a proven therapy method by Pavel Pascarev that Stimulates the brains neuroplasticity and helps with rewiring.

They've been saving my life, especially is those times when I feel like I just cannot! It's easy, it does not require big effort from me and it is something I can do anywhere on my phone and if practiced enough without anything and as that begins making a difference in my energy and reasoning brain, I regain the ability to do the other practices, like go back to the gym or get some sun and take daily walks, listen to good hormone inducing music etc.

I have been in a similar place to you before where I *needed* to be talking to my FP at all times or I'd lose it.

uldyu8,"I too got a recent diagnosis, and I wanna share some of the positive insights I’ve recently gained.

- There are evidence based and effective treatment options for people with BPD. Meaning, the way you’re feeling and living can be helped. You CAN live a healthier, more stable life. 

- There is a community of people who feel lmk ist like you. All those times you’ve felt like you’re broken/unfixable/isolated/alien… you’re not. So many people out there have some of the exact same symptoms/triggers/coping mechanisms as you. You’re not alone, and these life experiences have been seen by others. We are not doomed.

- When you do start learning how to use healthy coping mechanisms when triggered, once you come back down from the trigger, you’ll feel so fucking proud of yourself. For me, I caught myself mid-split and was able to stop the cycle I always find myself in. Then, it happened again, but this time I caught myself earlier on. And sure I know I’ll still experience the pain of BPD, but having control over my reactions gives me a lot of hope that I will live on solid ground again (hope that makes sense). 

- Kind of a side note, but since learning that my BOD came from trauma, it’s been affirming that what I went through was actually not okay, and my reactions and feelings are valid. I’m bigger than that trauma. And since I lived through that hell, I know I can survive. With therapy (started 2 weeks ago, so I’m currently riding the high of hope) I can take that strength I was forced to gain and build from there.

You deserve better. You will find inner peace, and you will find people who fill the role you so desperately need and deserve.

It is a highly narcissistic way of thinking. It isn't correct and the person saying that lacks empathy or can't deal with THEIR emotions. Please understand that. You are not incorrect.

In my case the person who was telling me these things I kept trying to explain to her that the more she pushed the further locked in my mental crisis prison I would get. It was horrible. I empathize so much with your pain and anger and self hatred. I tried and tried to change myself that way and its exhausting and soul crushing. 

From your post it sounds like your mom is very mentally damaging for you to be around. Is there a reason you are stuck being around her? Is there any way you can get out or away from her influence? You clearly have a lot of pain to process and this is only  making it worse. She probably will not listen to you. 


In my case the only thing that soothed that intense self loathing was that, miracle of miracles, the person who was pushing and gaslighting me ended up validating the harm they did to me apologizing and reaffirming that I did not deserve it (up to that point they insisted I deserved it). I have been locked in cycles with her for a long time. And the way out was that I swallowed my pride and apologized and took responsibility for the damage I had done her, and listened to her even though I didn't agree with her perspective, and she actually opened up about how much my behavior hurt her or just the pain she was feeling, and then I was able to follow that up by sharing the same, how much her behavior had impacted me. We still have to separate to heal and protect ourselves but I have never felt ANYTHING like that moment of validation. It showed me how powerfully mind destroying gaslighting is to someone with a vulnerable mind. I began to imagine what it would be like to be around people who did not gaslight me at all, even if I was simply alone. I imagined how different life might feel. 

It inspired me to decide with a heavy heart I have to cut off contact further with my parents if they keep gaslighting me and leave a job that is confusing where I have bad boundaries.
 I have thought I can tolerate it and explain or just put my feelings aside. But there will come a breakthrough point when you realize how much your peace matters and that nothing in the world is worth mental chaos because it will destroy your soul and everyone around you will be affected. 

All that is to say I hope you can find a way to unentangle from your mom even if you still care or love her. Don't be surprised if things begin to feel a lot different. The stuff you are saying here is very heavy and dangerous. That amount of shame and self blame will eat you alive.

I also struggle with oversharing my issues with unfit people, an early childhood pattern. That you can recognize it is a great step.

ujabxw,"Tbh if you don't have emotional disregulation it sounds like you might need to talk to your doctor about your diagnosis because that's the main issue with BPD. Perhaps they saw something in you that you haven't recognized, or perhaps they're wrong.

Also saying people with BPD quit their job because their bosses ""are mean to them"" sounds kind of disingenuous. Lots of people struggle with keeping jobs because they have a lot of bad mental health days and can't make it to work during crises, or for other reasons. Lots of people with BPD don't have trouble keeping a job, either. It's different for everyone and using language that implies immaturity is a bit insulting. 

Anyways, maybe see a different doctor if you feel this one just kind of pinned the label because they couldn't think of anything better.

Let's look at some questions regarding emotional disregualtion, because everything else does sound like BPD, but at the same time, it can always be due to other causes.

Maybe think these over and see if things start falling into place for you or if the BPD diagnosis still seems wrong ro you:

Have you asked anyone in your friends or family if they've noticed you have strong emotions?

How often do you lose your temper?

How often do you yell?

How often do you cry?

Do you get really excited about stuff to the point where you're yelling or jumping around?

How many times do you switch moods throughout the day? My neurotypical partner once told me he's usually in the same mood throughout the entire day and I was shocked. I have BPD and yeah. Different mood like... every hour? Every few hours? But each person is different. Like lots of neurological people can be moody.

Why do you think people cut you off?

In what ways do you seek revenge? I'm going to go ahead and say that's not a very healthy way of doing things. Doesn't necessarily say you have BPD but it does sound like it's related to a possible mental health issue.

These aren't necessarily ways to diagnose yourself or undiagnose yourself. They're just exploratory questions for you to see if you can understand yourself a bit more. But maybe they'll help you understand your doctor or dispute them if needed.

ug3oqn,"My best advice is to make a certain number of plans for each week or at least just keep yourself distracted with other things. This might be the time to try a new hobby like running or sculpting. For me, I get worse at night when I’m going through times of high stress. To combat this, I’ll try to make plans with others or even just myself (I.e go bowling or do a Walmart craft supply run for a project). 

And while I’m on it, here are more ideas to distract you from your emotional turmoil - reorganize your space, paint a room, create a costume for your next Halloween/costume party/convention, reach out to an old friend and reconnect, try this game on steam called Kind Words, make your own merch for a band/artist/movie you like using things from thrift stores, reorganize your closet, start a daily challenge like daily walks to give yourself a routine, try a new restaurant, reread a favorite book series to connect with your past self… I could go on.

I heavily rely on the distraction method to keep myself away from my most intense feelings so that I can reapproach the pain with a clearer head. It’s not that easy, but framing this as a new step towards a new life where you have control might be helpful. You’re not alone at all, and pain from a breakup is pain that I hope to never feel again. Trust that your feelings, though amplified and raw and scary to navigate, are NOT what rule you. You are in charge. Your emotions may try to take control, but if you set up these tools and safety nets of distractions, you’ll get through any pain step by step, day by day.

These symptoms sound very much like BPD to me (but I'm not a psychiatrist, of course). You don't have to have every BPD symptom to be correctly diagnosed. 

Even if you don't have BPD, or are on the less severe side of the BPD spectrum, it might be valuable for you to explore treatments for BPD, such as DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy). They could help with the interpersonal difficulties you're dealing with.

It's actually rarer for men to be diagnosed with BPD, so if a trained psychiatrist thinks you have it, might be something to take seriously.

ETA: Also, you can literally change what you think through practice. Meditation changes how you think, for instance.

remember that you are doing the complete opposite and you’re being vulnerable with him even when it’s hard and you’re being so strong sharing your feelings with him and even trying to improve your relationship, honesty is the first step in having a healthy FP relationship 

I had an online FP once and to try to make it a little healthier we would set specific times we could talk or call especially on days that are busy, I noticed that having time stamps of a call or a video chat during my day would give me something to look forward to so I wouldn’t be on my phone 24/7 waiting for him to respond to me.

Also, having identities away from each other like separate friend groups and hobbies (although ik it’s so tempting to absorb their life and personality) helps in lessening any tension as he will feel like he is able to be independent and that will bring you closer.

If you’re in therapy or you are aware of any DBT skills I’ve heard that DEAR MAN is a great skill to practice communication, especially in situations of conflict 

D- describe (clearly describe the facts of the situation with no judgement)
E- express (using “I” statements to express emotion)
A- assert (Clearly state what you want/ need with specifics)
R- reinforce (reward the other person if they respond well)
M- mindfulness (being mindful of your goal without being distracted by other issues)
A- appear confident (using clear words online etc)
N- negotiate (know your limits with the person)

szlo0i,"When I enter that particular rabbit hole, I try to climb out of it by literally tracing my steps back. Many a times, I realise that all these emotions are a wall between me and my pain. And that means holy fuck the only way to address that is by acknowledging my pain? Honestly that scares me even now but the more number of times I reach that confrontation, the less scarier it gets.

And somehow, it helps me realise that I was wronged. Sure, I am an adult who is responsible for my emotions and decisions and actions but I am also a child that was wronged or a person whose brain decided to be wired in a way that is inconvenient given the way things work in this society. And when I tell myself that, the pain resurfaces and that makes the guilt take the back seat. And it feels like a process of purging so it will get worse before it gets better but if you wish to see things through it's the only way. I'm still in the 'it gets worse' part but I can see the benefits. It has helped me identify and forgive myself for unproductive behaviours which are actually maladaptive coping mechanisms and this non judgmental attitude helped me let go of them and then, the guilt isn't as strong when it hits me next time.

It's a process--it will take months. All the stuff you've heard before that it is not a linear process. Sometimes you'll feel you've taken one step forward and two steps back or vice versa. The point is you have to keep moving forward on that path regardless. 

Also, somehow in that process--you see the child in you. And you realise they weren't even given a fair chance and if you go down the route of guilt and shame--they will never be given one. And you've got to give the kid a chance you know.

I'd ask you to write your discoveries down because these are strong emotions--you forget them easily and the knowledge gained through reflection will be lost then.

Makes sense, in my opinion. He doesn't want to change, he just wants to keep holding onto you, like you said. I think he will only get better at hiding. He also showed some narcissistic behaviors, to avoid taking responsibility he blames you, and instead of working with you he avoids and 'escapes' with fantasy casual relationships - flirting, sexting, imagining what he would 'have' if not for the relationship with you.

I can't say if your conditions or the cultural expectations are fair or not, but he chooses not to respect them, and doesn't seem to want to compromise and work with you. His 'expectations' are also not very fair; he seems very sketchy and self absorbed, and make me upset to read

>he is not meeting up with these people (again, it's the idea that it's not cheating if is not physical)

The only difference is the opportunity, and with a history of cheating, why *wouldn't* he give into the desire if the opportunity came up (when it comes up, TBH).

o4l0nw,"Hello Maivan,

That sounds very confusing and painful for you.  I'm sorry you're feeling this right now.

You say your boyfriend was there at the diagnosis and through the tough times, so I can imagine he has quite a good understanding of what you need and what triggers you.  I'm confused that he would just leave so coldly, knowing about the BPD, you must feel bewildered.

Maybe you could ask him to give you an honest explanation of why he left so that you can begin to process and heal?

My biggest advice when someone leaves... Stop looking at social media, pictures, stuff.  Anything that relates to them.  Have extreme self control and refuse the compulsion.  The longer we look at things, the more our brain tricks us into desperation that we need that person back.  It tricks us because love releases dopamine and it wants that hit.

Secondly, remember who you were.  What did you love doing?  I like going for woodland walks in the rain, knitting, eating nachos at the cinema on my own, singing on Smule, meeting up with friends for drinks, having random adventures like a train to the beach etc!

Try to incorporate sociability into your life regularly, even if this is just taking a trip to the shops.  It keeps me rational and helps me keep perspective of things.

Own your triggers and unhealthy coping and AVOID.  I like drinks with friends but I won't be doing that during a break up because I KNOW it's a binge excuse.

Take care of yourself.

imo, there's two kinds of friends you can make: 1) a friend who doesn't entirely get you, but does listen to you, validate you, support you and love you no matter what; and 2) a friend who is in the same boat and recognizes 98% of the emotions and feelings you have, no matter how crazy it might seem to you. i have a mix of both i think, and i met them by being painfully, awkwardly honest to them, and i have also lost a lot of friends like that, because they couldn't be either of the two types mentioned above.

and that fucking sucks. i still get nightmares about my friends turning their back on me and me dying alone and unloved, I still get triggered whenever a friend doesn't reply to me for a while and i am not sure why. but i just have to have faith that they are not doing it to hurt me, and that i'm still a valid person deserving of love and respect even when someone rejects me. i think that takes a lot of time and effort and i kinda feel like some kind of pope, preaching to others when i cried for three days just two weeks ago because someone i considered a friend rejected me quite harshly, but i DID pick myself back up after that, and i think that's the most important part.

kqnfuc,"Oh, I hear you. Thanks for sharing. I don't have an answer for you ask I dumped my family in 2014 for what was supposed to be a temporary therapeutic time but turned into, phew am I ever glad you are all out of my life permanently time. I still talk to mom and she's probably the worst, but you know, you don't ditch your mom. Distance is key, you have to be nice which is super annoying, but good practice, and yeah I am not really going to provide great advice here, just that I fully identify with this. Don't take their bullshit is the number one, and feel free to disengage and do something you really enjoy instead of having horrible conversations on repeat or not getting the effort you put in back. Reward yourself for your own efforts, don't wait for validation because, and this is the worst reality ever, but it may not come.

My family doesn't know about my mental health, they're all pretty ignorant. I found it really best to just reduce contact with all of them- I mean, you don't have to fully cut them off (I did cut off my dad though, and it's been years and I still feel really solid in the decision, and he still sends me money and weird emails sometimes regardless of requests that he not, and I still have never changed my mind).  

I feel like those generations have romantic notions about family and it just doesn't mean the same thing to me at all- I mean keeping in mind that our parents like ""had"" to make up with their horrifically abusive parents for our sake, and (in my case anyway) even though that didn't make anything really better I just had to deal with a drunk dad *and* his drunk dad, they want that, they want the fiction, and resolution, and probably they do just love you too.  But, more likely they at least partially think you owe them something, which is kind of like love? really not.  I don't owe my family shit, and they aren't even the worst, I just don't. 

I started limiting the amount of contact I had with my family over many years and just stopped allowing their bullshit to impact me in my adult life (this is obviously impossible being in the same house and I am so sorry you have to I haven't done that for years and can't even imagine what it would be). This started with not talking to family about other family members (as in inter-familiar gossip), and then yeah it really was an i've had enough never again thing with my dad, and pretty much everyone disowned me for that so it made it pretty easy really. I don't know, every once and a while there is a random phone call and some backhanded comment and i'm like, you know, you are all just making a case for me never speaking to you again, bye.  I just stopped taking it.

Maybe that is just a major cop-out, but truly, my family has so much trauma, we could talk for literally decades and I don't think we'd ever work through it, nor do I even really want to. I truly just feel better and more emotionally stable when I don't have relationships and I don't know that that will ever be communicated to my family without a wall of shame thrown at me, but i'm just like that, it's fine, it's better. We can talk sometimes, you aren't all dead to me or anything, it's just, not the same it's a different kind of relationship we have now, one that I have a lot more agency over.  

I think, after many years, they finally got it and started being a lot nicer.  I think they realized that they literally would not have a relationship with me at all, and that this wasn't a symptom of me being young and irresponsible, it was a choice, a very difficult one, to divorce my family, and it really worked out for me. So things are a lot better, but had I stayed? Had I accepted that I would have to go to my aunt's house bi-annually bc it was too hard to stay in the city, or kept pandering to my dad's drinking and adult-baby bullshit? i'd still be doing it, I know it.  I'd be unhappy and co-dependent and the relationships I would have chosen outside of these unhealthy relationships would also be bad. So, if it is feeling impossible right now, it's likely because it is, and just take comfort in knowing that it will be over soon at least and you can work on those relationships from a distance soon.  


I took a lot of distance from most people I was close to when I was diagnosed BPD- I still don't fully understand why or how my relationships were disregular, and having no relationships (or many casual relationships which is more the case now) was an important part of figuring that out at least partially.  When I did this I went through relationship relapse and bounced around a lot of shit people for a while out of total boredom, but eventually it got old and the patterns were much more obvious and I did see how ridiculous I am sometimes.  I feel that had I not removed extraneous stress I would not have come to those realizations and probably would just have continued the abusive patterns that I learned growing up.    


I'm not saying don't waste your energy- people are worth your care, but I guess having different (lowered, almost none) expectations is a good approach? I feel like the changes in my relationships are pretty minimal actually, but I did some work to deal with how I process the things my family say to me, and THAT is a very difficult thing, and once that work is done, yeah it's easier.  I care less, I don't think about the past, I don't sweat the ""small things"" (they aren't small!!) bc I can't- it hurts, it hurts me too much, i'm maxed on hurt. I guess bc I had that long period of no contact, when the contact happened again it wasn't so intense. detraumatization can take a decade. Distance by choice not neglect is very empowering if you are, like me, a child of neglect. It's work that my dad never did or got to do, and that I remember also, it's not even really his fault you know? It's just also not my problem.    


Family, especially if your family are kind of assholes who never learned to behave, isn't always the most positive support system for ppl with bpd starting therapy.  Bc yeah, having them around is triggering as fuck. You are allowed to set firm limits and take your space to heal. Don't worry about mum, she'll be fine and she's there and she doesn't have to deal with having a mental illness right now, you do. 

If people ask what your deal is or enact anger or resentment, just state clearly ""yes, i'm sorry that I have been distant, I am taking some real time to focus on myself and improving my mental health. part of this is in relation to my relationships and I am finding it beneficial to have some distance from family members so that I can figure it all out.  I hope we can talk soon/again about this once I find the help I am seeking, I simply don't want to create conflict or damage our relationship in the process because it is important to me. Thank you for being patient, it may be a slow process and could take some time. Do you have other supports and people you can turn to about... so and so?... You know I am always here if you really need me, but right now it is important that I take space, thank you for respecting that.""  

They probably need space too. Sometimes engaging family members in a therapeutic exercise makes them understand your life and the work it takes to just function, and maybe also the differences in how you process things.  ""hey mom, I found this really cool new breathing or visualization technique, it only takes a couple of minutes, would you want to try it out with me?"" If they aren't responsive to this kind of effort (which, if you are like me and emotional regulation is almost impossible we know that is a loooot of effort) just run.  Disengage, take your space, just focus on you and make that your only focus for a while. It's not worth it, right now, to keep trying there. Set firm limits as to how much of your energy is going to the people around you and communicate them directly.   


It is different for everyone, but I found myself to be too vulnerable to be around anyone I knew following my diagnosis.  I changed cities, found places to be basically with other mentally ill people who were into leaving eachother alone, and was careful about who I interacted with and how, with many, many setbacks.  I just couldn't factor family into the equation at all, it was too necessary for me to get well, and I did, and my family was still there, just not so there that i'm in a trauma blackout whenever I think about them.   


Sorry for the essay, I hope that helps a bit anyway if only that I can relate.  I absolutely hate when people tell me to let shit go, without understanding that it is almost impossible for some people to do that, but I think for myself anyway it is less letting shit go and more not allowing myself to be re-traumatized and hurt by others' and this is a whole strategy that is more effective than just being like whatever, I don't care.  I always care, but it really only hurts me to care too much, caring less is good sometimes.",,False,1610359068.0

jlvvbh,"I describe splitting like this: when I feel a certain emotion so hard I can only feel that and I forget how it feels to not feel that way and that it’s temporary. I forget that I’ve ever even felt an emotion opposite of that, it’s like I’ve always felt this one emotion and can’t remember anything else. 

The biggest example for me is with my gf when she upsets me or makes me angry. I start to hate her and not want to be with her and I forget that she’s ever done anything nice for me or that 10 mins ago I was so in love with her or that she’s not the most evil person in the world. I’m the same way as you in that there are some relationships where I don’t do this. Usually the people I don’t do this with it’s because I’m not comfortable with them or feel like I have that close of a relationship with them, or because I don’t really care about their friendship that much tbh. 

I only act like this with people I’m really really close with and who I care about on some level. If I already think you’re not a very good friend and I don’t feel that close to you then I don’t care about you and I don’t split around you cus things you do won’t affect me negatively. If I feel a strong connection to you and you do something to negatively affect that is usually when I split. 

I think the difference between annoyance and splitting is whether you’re able to still think clearly and rationally, and feel other emotions. Like when I’m annoyed by someone, I can still feel other emotions and remember good things about them, but when I’m splitting it’s like nothing else exists except whatever negative feeling I’m feeling. If your negative feelings are disproportionate to whatever the cause of them are, you’re splitting. 

Example:(please don’t judge me) a girl me and my gf got in a fight with at a bar busted my lip open by throwing a glass when my hands were being held behind my back and after she left the bar I wished she would get into a car accident and die. And I couldn’t stop thinking about it and wishing for bad things to happen to her for at least an hour. I didn’t know this wasn’t normal and other people don’t do this until that night because my gf was like wtf stop saying that it’s not that serious. I’ve gotten a lot better at not doing this but this is a really good example of your emotions being really disproportionate to the situation that caused them.
