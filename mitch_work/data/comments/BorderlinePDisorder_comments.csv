1cvwsxt,"There are a few things going on here. First and foremost if you feel suicidal please take care of yourself first and call the national suicide hotline or reach out to a family member or someone irl than can help you. Suicide is never the answer. 

  
With that out of the way - yes it does get better and it can go into remission. You should be very proud of yourself that you have cut contact with your favorite person. Small challenge is that you seem to be acting like a dry drunk. What does that mean? a dry drunk is someone who has successfully quit alcohol but has not found anything else to replace alcohol in terms of self-regulation. Given the example, you may have cut contact with your favorite person, but you still need to find your own positive ways to deal with your intense emotions and feelings. That can be done through DBT or working with a therapist. I do understanding socio-economic status is a hinderance for a lot who suffer from BPD, the DBT workbook on Amazon is only $30 though. 

The best thing you can do is to learn is to take care of yourself and not rely on others to do this for you. You mentioned in your post that you lack real life friends and social interactions. Put yourself out there to meet people and make all sorts of cool friends. I myself have joined a progressive church, have done boxing, and have done fitness classes. There is hopefully a lot of things you can to get out there and meet new people to make friends. 

Overall, your mood stabilizes, and you won't bounce up and down as much if you learn to meet your needs and take care of yourself. Be a friend to yourself first and foremost, you can do this. Take care <3.",Colombian_Vice,False,1716149548.0

1cvw3m8,"I saw your comment about this on another post so I thought I would try to tackle it.

>but since researching BPD a little I see she can‚Äôt completely help herself no matter what and in some way is telling the truth.

This is not completely accurate.  

If she's been diagnosed with BPD then she's seen a therapist/psychiatrist or been in a hospital.  People who are unaware that they have BPD are more likely to engage in the behaviors and not recognize they are doing so or not know that they are not typical.  She know that she has BPD, which means that she's been somewhere like here before.  I think what it is, is that she doesn't want to stop.  

That's the trouble with pwBPD sometimes and why a lot of therapists don't want to treat us or rather find it a challenge.  

To answer your question, did she break up with you because of her BPD?  I think she's cycling and there isn't anything you can really do about it.  She has to want to stop, and want to figure out a way to stop.  She may be doing that now by breaking up with you.",GurWild5314,False,1716217095.0

1cvvhm9,"You hit the nail on the head - it is definitely BPD. You or those diagnosed bpd by a professional deal with the challenge of formulating healthy attachments with people. The reason there is a challenge is because people with BPD deal with a primary fear of being abandoned . Thus they often subjugate their needs in favor of their potential friends or FP (favorite person - one who meets all their emotional needs). 

Since this problem is occurring in real time - there is nothing another person can do: friend, loved one, favorite person, can do to ever fix the black hole that is the fear of abandonment. As such, it will always feel like you are giving 110% and other person is giving like 50%. 

  
The best thing you can do is give 110% to yourself and befriend yourself. You don't need others to meet all your needs, you can be empowered to do that on your own. Learn to enjoy being alone and do some self-care. Don't shame yourself for having this, journal, therapy, workout, etc etc. Learn to take care of your self and then you won't need others to do that for you.

1cvui9f,"I like a lot of what others have said, here's a bit from my experience:

What's good to keep in mind is that a big part of BPD is that we feel emotions a lot stronger. Neurotypical people /those without BPD feel emotions on a 0-10 scale and we're a -20 to 20 scale. 

So when I start to feel affection and get the warm & ""man I care about you"" feeling, it feels really strong, and like ""man I REALLY care about you SO much"". It's not ""I like it when we hang out,"" it's ""I LOVE being with you in any way""

When I was younger I thought this was love. I remember my best friend telling me how her boyfriend (now husband, fyi) freaked her out by saying ""I love you"" after a month and validating her but internally thinking ""I mean....idk that seems pretty reasonable"" (especially since this was undergrad so they were spending nearly everyday together). I remember her talking about how he was just inexperienced as she was his first girlfriend and how he was confusing ""puppy love"" with ""real love"" and just kinda thinking ""okay, but maybe that is what he was feeling! Especially the second time when you told him to chill it after 3 months!""

While I think she was also young and a little extreme, but there is something to it. I did tell my bf a few years later that I loved him within 3 weeks of putting labels on it, but to be fair, he said it after 1. Looking back, I do think there was a pretty strong difference between how I felt then and how I felt 6 months later and a year later, because there's a different closeness  that comes with time as you know each other more and more. 

I think the start of something has 3 things contributing to this ""confusion"", 1) feelings of affection and attachment that are growing really fast and level out later, but that acceleration feels like a lot, 2) the excitement, you've got a new person, everything is exciting and fun and new, and 3) increase in how often youre feeling happy, and especially someone with BPD who might experience chronic emotional pain would notice this uptick. Basically the feeling of *falling in* love is different from *being IN* love which is different from *love*. 

I'm currently seeing a new guy and it's been about 6  weeks. Every once in a while, I'll just feel this surge and think ""I love you!"" and then try to talk back to it immediately ""no, no, that's not love, not yet"" and I never say anything. What Im actually feeling is ""I really like you"" or ""I really like that new thing I just learned about you"" or ""I'm really happy right now"" or ""damn son, you hot"" but it feels so strong AND so strong of a positive in comparison to the -10 to 5 that I generally exist in, but right now I'm feeling a 16 and that's big. Learning to recognize that these aren't ""real adult love"" but the pre-stages that just feel really strong has been good and helpful for navigating relationships, but is a little tricky to reign in/manage my first instinct 

So yeah idk if that's helpful, but that's my experience.",feisty-spirit-bear,False,1716161443.0
1cvui9f,"i'd hope that their bpd isn't constantly at the forefront of your mind for future situations when they're expressing their feelings. moving quickly/feeling deeply is not solely a bpd trait. i'd try taking their expressions of affection at face value, especially if you've had sex i'm not sure why the mention of falling (but not being) would be weird? sex can create attachments from all the hormones, which is why lots of people decide to wait until exclusive before getting physical

In my opinion, this shows you are more of an avoidant person, rather than discussing things head on. That is something a person with BPD NEEDS: clarity, no avoidance. 

If you find it odd that after the 6th date, and sleeping together, someone shares they have growing feelings for you, then this person might not be for you.

1cvui9f,"Okay, first of all it makes me angry how you handle their feelings.. they opened up to you after being intimate and you said ""thanks for sharing"" and didn't talk about it five days long? They probably felt very sad and frustrated the entire time. Second, you are making the diagnosis too big! It is not the biggest part of their personality and feeling love towards a person after being intimate is pretty common (especially in women) because of all the hormones being set free. Don't ever invalidate their feelings by assuming they are a symptom. I can speak for myself, I would honestly hate you for that. Nobody wants to be reduced by their diagnosis (of any kind). If I was you, I'd tell them: ""I am so sorry for leaving you with your feelings like this. I didn't know what to say, because I really like you a lot and love spending time with you, but I am more of a cautious person when it comes to love.

1cvui9f,"As other people have already commented, it is kinda weird that you‚Äôre assuming that ‚Äúfalling in love‚Äù fast has something to do with BPD, when so many people (including neurotypical ones) experience that. 

I‚Äôm assuming here, but it might be that you are putting weight on BPD to deflect how you feel about their feelings or being afraid to hurt them. I am surprised that they didn‚Äôt have an intense emotional reaction to how you handled things (at least being able to not show it). It would suck for anyone to get a ‚Äúthanks‚Äù and no follow up for that long.

When you make someone feel safe and cared for the chances of them spiraling or reacting negatively are lower. This is true for any person, but specially for someone with BPD, who work really hard on ‚Äúmanaging their emotional reactions.‚Äù If you understand that it‚Äôs hard for them then put in the effort to make it easier for the both of you. Be more proactive, reach out to address emotional stuff first, come from a place of care for them instead of fear of blow up.

I feel like those with BPD split on themselves - they deal with a lot of toxic shame. I feel it's ok to feel you need to take pride in your appearance and get into shape. Those are admirable goals. That being said - putting ourselves down by being very overly critical and frankly self abusive is not necessary. 

Having BPD is learning how to meet your needs and be kinder to yourself. The truth is you don't need to blame it all on yourself, you just ""feel"" like you have to because that makes sense to you. The idea is to find other ways to deal with this feeling, whether it be self-hatred or fear of abandonment. 

The best way to go about this goal is to befriend yourself and engage in self care. Do some DBT therapy etc. No other person, friend, loved one, or favorite person you obsess over will ever be able to meet all your needs, it's impossible. The best person to meet your needs is yourself and you can do it. In the end, we have to learn to take care of ourselves and meet our own needs.

I would also say: Don't let your partner dictate your emotions or the other relationships in your life. It sounds like you're doing the important work of getting your own life back on track.

Sounds like you were being, if unspoken, like ""Hey, this is my person."" And you may have been so involved in your own feelings of possessiveness and guarding that you may have crossed some boundaries, namely her choice as to who she talks to.

So, I would invite you to write down on paper the nature of the relationship you have with this person as it exists in your mind and as it may exist in her mind. Don't send her anything about this, this is for you and she doesn't want to  hear about it.

As someone else commented, there are ways to navigate the system. It will very likely be difficult of course, insurance companies are looking for profit, not to help provide us with what we need. I have been very fortunate to have a lot of great supports around me who refused to give up on me and helped me advocate for my needs, with providers as well as insurance.

I will always advocate for people, especially those with BPD, to get some form of treatment. Get a secondary insurance if you can, to help cover copays.

1cvompm,"As someone who was diagnosed with BPD a few months ago but has been struggling with these symptoms for a long time, and as someone whose relationship just ended because of my symptoms and now my symptoms have indeed gotten 1000x worse because of it, here is my two cents.

I understand that you feel that leaving her is like letting someone drive drunk. That makes complete sense. However ultimately, another person is not your responsibility. If you feel the need to leave, you need to leave. You can't take care of everyone and I do think that people who have a hero complex, a need to save everyone, tend to end up with people with BPD, sort of like a perfect storm.

That being said... if you GENUINELY want to be with her, and not just because of the need to save her, but if you GENUINELY love her, it's possible for this to get better IF and only if she is willing to change and get help HERSELF.

Leaving for the sake of leaving because you are afraid of enabling her isn't the right thing to do in my opinion (I don't know if this is what your'e thinking but I've seen people post things like that before) - because it's true that leaving will make things harder, confirm her fears and worst nightmares, etc etc. Ultimately if you need to do it, you need to do it.

But healing can happen in a relationship where the other person can prove the BPD person wrong, as in, ""I know you think the other shoe is going to drop at any moment and I'm going to leave, but let's prove that wrong..."" (and here's the key) ""...TOGETHER."" She has to be willing to put in the work too. By this I mean... whatever healing is for her... intensive therapy like a DBT program if not a PHP (I am currently in a PHP which means that it's daily therapy for five hours, and the program has a pretty heavy emphasis on DBT which is typically seen as the best treatment for BPD), medications, meditation, learning about and unpacking her traumas with an individual therapist, perhaps reading books like ""CPSTD from surviving to thriving,"" listening to podcasts about BPD and/or DBT skills, workbooks, whatever healing means to her and works for her, really. I think the best case scenario is her doing this kind of work, with you lovingly but firmly insisting that she has to do this stuff, to be safe, in order for you guys to be safe in your relationship.

If she can't do any of that, this pattern will continue.

You are a wonderful person for not taking her lashing out personally. Really you are. If you can continue to be patient in that way but also insist she needs to get help, and really hold to that boundary like ""we can't be together if you don't get help""... that is honestly a dream scenario for someone with BPD, in a way.

Editing to add that I recommend you go to therapy too, if not also intensive therapy.

Unfortunately I only saw this after my ex-GF cheated on me. I was too busy, avoidant, and in a LDR and other men were there in her down period to take advantage while she accepted them in a really anxious time.

Know that if you don‚Äôt give her validation she will get it elsewhere it‚Äôs like a drug and she is addicted. Probably she will have other people she talks to very closely in life that you don‚Äôt know about for the same reason - to be sure of supply.  My ex had no friends I was her best friend so when she went to her masters program she found friends but really they just wanted to get in her pants. 

I would say above all you need 1) future planning 2) strict adhesion to plans and timing 3) clear boundaries and priorities in the relationship.

1cvlw8j,"I agree with this, but I also want to say *BPD is not an excuse or justification for abuse.* If things begin to escalate and your safety comes in question, do not blame yourself. Leave if you need to. This is a very difficult disorder to live with, and it‚Äôs especially hard on those around us. Even if our intention isn‚Äôt to harm our loved ones, sometimes our symptoms can become too much to bear, and sometimes these symptoms can be downright abusive. 

Set boundaries. Be firm on these boundaries. If your partner isn‚Äôt in therapy or some form of treatment, try to encourage them to seek help if you can. Find ways to communicate when finding the right words may be difficult for her. For example, my ex and I had a system for when the fear of abandonment kicked in and I started reassurance seeking. We called it the ‚Äúwe good?‚Äù system. Basically if I asked him if ‚Äúwe good?,‚Äù he would either tell me if there were any issues and we‚Äôd address them, or he‚Äôd say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre good‚Äù and I trusted him on that.

You could also read *I Hate You, Don‚Äôt Leave Me* to get a better idea on how BPD works.

I'm almost 40 now, and these types of triggers truly don't get to me anymore, and I find it easier to pull myself out of my spirals and think through a situation. Then I'll take action on my own part to confront it if it needs confronting to get my answers, so I don't have to think myself to death! 

I do think it's too early in your relationship to talk to this person in such a confronting way because realistically we can't expect other people to be ""on"" all the time for us and we need to self soothe. Additionally, you're just getting to know each other, and our intensity in relationships is seldom matched by another. I know if the expectation was put on me to constantly say good morning to someone or else they would get upset with me, I'd get really annoyed by this. I find it does help to try and view it from that perspective, and if someone wanted this from you, would you be happy about it. It helps to ground the thoughts. 

I think you truly just need to tell yourself over and over to get the message through that getting a good morning text isn't the end of the world. What's more important is to view the overall behaviour of this person and if they aren't treating you right, especially ignoring you after sex, and you feel discarded and unimportant regardless of a good morning text, then it isn't right for you. I'm not suggesting you break up or whatever, but as I said, you're just getting to know one another so observe how you're being treated and if you don't like it then move on. You don't need to be stuck with this one person if it's making you feel emotionally disregulated. 

If you do find yourself in a long-term relationship and you've gotten to know each other better, I find it does help to be honest with your partner. If you feel insecure when you don't hear from them, letting them know is important. And not in a way that they have to do it but just so that it might be on their radar and they could make a little more effort to help you out.

That same weekend he woke up early and said ""ima put my things in storage and move in""
And so he did... Things were just flowing, I never pushed anything. When you let things happen... They do. I put all my anxieties aside... I said fuck it all... My worrying isn't helping me and it's never served me any good.
Then after a while he brought his things over and got rid of the storage unit.
Last year after only dating for 15 months he proposed and we got married this January. 
We both have traumas.. it's not hard. I believe we both have bpd. But we work really hard to be aware of each others feelings. We talk about it.. we say things that are upsetting us. 
BUT IT HAS TO COME FROM A PLACE OF LOVE. Not pointing fingers.. not blaming.. Just honesty and love. Men respond well to honesty and vulnerability. Women nowadays are so proud and independent... We need to show we are human, not superheroes. Be sweet to him instead of aggressive because of past traumas, he will understand it better that way and embrace loving you if he's not a toxic person.

And the fact that he always told me he didn't have romantical feelings while I obviously did with all the attachment us with an FP experience, yet he always kept me with him and couldn't block me... It felt to me he was constantly fighting his care of me but saving his sanity. I deeply loved him. I still do. I don't know if is even love due to my BPD but he made me feel alive.

After some time we started getting intimate and he told me he was starting having feelings and told me numerous time he loved me. Imagine how it felt after 1 year and half of unrequited feelings. But then he stopped and was confused and decided we should stay friends because he feared to hurt me.

He was also having affairs with another girl I knew... and now they're in a relationship. I felt devastated and can't describe the pain because he blocked me and that didn't stop me to send hundreds of email messages and begging and (real) suicide threats which made him only worse and threatened to contact authorities if I won't stop.

I can't even imagine if he ever reaches out to me again, and not sure how will I take it. I miss him, today is one of those days I feel so terrible and went back on memories and his voice messages and such. It's so hard.

So i think our brains connects a lot of information which most of will be stored outside of your active contiousness - especially when you have strong emotions like trauma for example, i think our brains are capable of remembering things like sounds, taste or smell. 

For me when i get angry in some specific way, i smell the perfume which my mother wore like 20 years ago. 
Its fascinating. 

If i remember correctly Sigmund Freud called what we call borderline ‚Äûpseudo schizophrenia‚Äú like a century ago. 
Because of the Halluzination of smelling something while being in an intense emotional state (trigger) i looked up schizophrenia and found out its not just visual or auditory halluzinations, its also smell or taste for some affected people. 

As far as i know its quite normal in BPD to have some kind of mild halluzination which get also fueled by other common comorbidities like dissociation i guess.

1cunjmg,"I was misdiagnosed bipolar 1. It took 7 years before I was diagnosed with BPD. The main thing to keep in mind are what symptoms you have, their intensity, and how long they last. 

Mania is a detachment from reality. I have bipolar friends, I‚Äôve seen their manic episodes. One example is a coworker of mine who went into a manic episode, was hospitalized, and came back refusing to take their meds. They changed their name to Bear and began telling us about how they nearly died and became enlightened from it. They then proceeded to shop around and bought over $400 of nonsense items. For example, they bought a ‚Äú2‚Äù birthday candle because it was their 6 month anniversary with their partner, and the ‚Äú2‚Äù represented how they‚Äôre two people, one soul. They bought a birthday card despite it not being their partner‚Äôs birthday. None of the stuff was necessary, and they didn‚Äôt seem phased by the price. 

This, in my opinion, is different from hypomania and BPD euphoria. With BPD, I would get rejected by someone and then my ego would surge. I‚Äôd listen to upbeat music about how much of a bad bitch I am, I wouldn‚Äôt sleep well that night, I‚Äôd make plans to go out with other guys and I‚Äôd stalk my now ex‚Äôs social media. I‚Äôd pick fights with friends. But I would sleep well after that, I maintained an appetite, my mind wasn‚Äôt necessarily racing.. and it wouldn‚Äôt last more than a day or so. It was never random, instead always triggered by either something that happened in my life or a new medication I was on. The only times I experienced ‚Äúhypomania‚Äù were drug induced, usually by cannabis or stimulants. That‚Äôs why I have a comorbid bipolar 2 diagnosis, but I‚Äôm currently not medicated. I haven‚Äôt had an episode since getting off stimulants and antidepressants/neuroleptics (knock on wood). 

Mania has to last at least 2 weeks. It‚Äôs either followed by depression or a return to baseline. In my experience with my friends, mania can last much longer. You‚Äôre more likely to have psychotic symptoms during mania as well. This includes hallucinations, extreme delusions (BPD can also have paranoid ideation, but there‚Äôs a difference between thinking people are out to get you vs. you having magical powers and being a reincarnation of a deity), etc. Mania is very serious. I‚Äôm not saying BPD isn‚Äôt serious, but the two look different. 

I‚Äôm honestly surprised you were diagnosed type I outside of a hospital. Most people get diagnosed after their first manic episode. Then again, I was diagnosed outpatient too, and solely off of family history. So it‚Äôs possible. 

If you think mania doesn‚Äôt fit your symptoms, I‚Äôd recommend getting a second opinion. I know it takes longer to be diagnosed/evaluated for a personality disorder, but I‚Äôd try to get evaluated too.

Also, Vraylar gave me a severe adverse reaction (that‚Äôs apparently rare?) called akathisia. It looked like mania, which led to me getting put on more meds, making it worse. It took me going into mild neurotoxicity from lithium and finding a bipolar specialist who believed me to figure out what was happening. 2 years later I am doing so much better.

1cuneg9,"Here are two methods for finding a path that will bring you closer toward your values:

1. Ask your wise mind for advice. Ask a question and listen for the answer. Or similarly, bring to mind a person who you deeply respect for their wisdom, this could also be God or a Higher Power. With them already knowing everything about the situation exactly the way it is right now, what choice/behavior would make them proud of you?

2. For decisions with a lot of factors on both sides, making a pros and cons grid helps get everything out in one place where you can see it.

This isn't something like a kiss that could be done so impulsively and so quickly. She quite literally took the steps leading into full-blown sexual intercourse with someone, she knew exactly what she was doing. She had time to acknowledge, to think about this. However, she knew in that moment she did not love or care about you enough to stop herself.

Covering up the Cheating is a different story. That isn't weakness, it is a conscious continuous decision. You are justified to break up and I think you know that but you also don't have to if you don't want to. Trust is very difficult to earn back but it can happen with enough work from both partners. My first advice is to ensure she is trying to seek help (seems like she is). Next, if you want to move on, you have to move on. You csnt have a microscope on her 24/7. Checking her phone every day etc. Its not fair to YOU. and it isn't going to help move on. If you think she will do it again then do not try to fix this. If you believe she made s horrific mistake and feels so deeply disgusted by it and you love this woman, recognize that she is human and young. Weak and flawed.

This is not an excuse but to help you understand where people with BPD are coming from. Hurting your feelings are a byproduct or side effect - the reason it's done is to meet their needs they never got from their parents, peers, etc. 

I'd only stay with her if she is willing to get therapy, take medication, and take steps to making you feel secure and safe in the relationship. You deserve it of course and you should always have self respect to not put up with immoral behavior. Secondly, it's NOT you're responsibility to fix, save, be there, stay her friend or w.e. either.

There are always boundaries to each and every partner in a relationship that is truly subjective to what they ‚Äúcan‚Äù and ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù handle, so that‚Äôs your decision at the end of the day. 

The thing is that she has autism with a comorbidity of BPD so of course her thought processes are going to be different and more impulsive if not taken care of properly.

I used to think finding the right girl or guy would fix all of my problems. I used to outsource my problems / what to do to my best friends because I couldn't seem to manage my own life without the help form others. Furthermore, I've had the urges that you do to run away and leave everything behind thinking everything would get better by changing my environment. This is a tough life lesson but you cannot run away from yourself. 

I see from your post you speak very negatively about yourself. I doubt you would speak to another person like this, so why speak to yourself like this? Given whatever that answer is, X, Y, or Z, perhaps that is what you should aim at processing with a therapist or if you can't afford one, journaling all of this out.

I don't deny at all that making those changes are extremely difficult and I cannot recommend enough the assistance and life saving help from medication. All of this seems like a giant mountain to climb, however, you owe it to yourself to self-care, befriend your emotions, and be kind to yourself.

So in general, learning emotional regulation for every day is what keeps you from getting heightened and ""splitting"", and just looking at the fact that you're feeling heightened and need to do some regulation, and not assess if you're right or wrong in that moment, will help.",Achristina888,False,1716052663.0

1cuhaei,"You‚Äôre feelings are always valid. It‚Äôs just how you react with your feelings that can be deemed ‚Äúoverly emotional‚Äù or an emotional displacement. I deal with the same struggle as you and many others with BPD. 

I copied a one of my recent responses I gave to someone else‚Äôs post the other day on here to give some insight of what I‚Äôve been doing so far with helping myself! Here it is below:

I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with BPD myself. I also was diagnosed with cPTSD at the age of 16 due to traumatic events I never got help with nor closure with. I‚Äôm 28 now, so the majority of my life prior to this year being diagnosed, my emotional displacements and irregularities have been the most challenging aspect of my life. My unstable development and unsupportive environment was also a huge catalyst to my mental health condition worsening.

I‚Äôve mentioned these issues with my therapist about four months ago, because my life felt as if it was going down-down. I had less emotional resilience to my triggers, developed more bad habits that contributed to my depression/anger/anxiety, and just had this massive dissociation overall with myself. I saw that psychotherapy would be recommended in my situation. I mentioned it to my therapist and she completely agreed and was happy to see that I‚Äôm taking initiative to myself.

She recommended Dialectal Behavior Therapy to start with. Gave me a book for it too. I read it from time to time, take notes, apply the practice and reflect on it with her. I‚Äôve been seeing a huge difference in how I regulate my feelings. Before DBT, I would always fester into my feelings and argue about things such as unjustly and irrational treatment I received from people and family, people contradicting themselves while having high expectations from me, dwelling on trauma in an unhealthy way, etc. This process so far with DBT has been teaching me how to understand my triggers and how to mitigate my reactions from them, building better resiliences mentally for it all. As well as truly understanding these feelings and why I process these feeling so intensely, it all can stem from something. It also has been teaching me how to let go of the ‚Äúcontrol factor‚Äù for life, even if I am being completely rational with these expectations; learning that I only have control in MY life.

Examples of things that are IN control of my life:

1.	‚Å†The amount of effort I put in
2.	‚Å†My words
3.	‚Å†My actions
4.	‚Å†How I treat others
5.	‚Å†Whether or not I follow rules
6.	‚Å†How I handle my feelings
7.	‚Å†My decisions
8.	‚Å†How I take care of myself

Examples of things that are OUT of my control:

1.	‚Å†What other people do
2.	‚Å†What other people say
3.	‚Å†Things from the past
4.	‚Å†How other people feel
5.	‚Å†Other people‚Äôs choices
6.	‚Å†The weather (lol)

My overall opinion about DBT, I would say I‚Äôve made massive steps and strides with myself. I‚Äôm reprogramming myself in positive ways. I‚Äôm able to stay in the ‚Äúnow‚Äù without worrying about the future nor dwelling in the past as much. I‚Äôm able to process my feelings better and catch myself when I‚Äôm starting to ‚Äúrev up‚Äù into my emotions when something triggers me. I‚Äôm being more active and forcing routine into my life to have better and healthier coping strategies, as well as learning new coping and soothing strategies to avoid emotional displacements and irrational choice making. It‚Äôs been unreal to be honest. My family sees a difference in me too, which they are happy about. Sure my days aren‚Äôt always perfect, there will be slip ups. But it‚Äôs about the bounce back and refocus. Acknowledge the error, move on and make a valiant effort into doing better the next time! This is where I feel the quote, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre only human‚Äù comes into play healthily.

I would recommend a therapist and psychiatrist, if you‚Äôre able to, to see what you would personally need to help with your issues. And I wish you and everyone else who struggles with BPD nothing but the best!",HemloStimky,False,1716148726.0
1cuhaei,"So true. 

Because this is what I struggle with with most of my triggers. They are valid. I just overreact.

I do NOT have to split and think ‚Äùomg, this person hates me, everyone hates me, of course they hate me, I am a horrible person, of course I have no friends, I feel so lonely, life is not worth living when I am alone‚Äù etc. And getting mad the next time I see them.

Technique 'Stop' is also very useful to me when I'm 'in tge heat of a moment' (link below).

But I guess ghosting would be the worst thing I‚Äôve done in these types of situations. And ghosting someone who may have BPD can be horrible, and even if I had valid reasons to do it, I know firsthand how it can trigger that fear of abandonment. 

But if I‚Äôm being super honest, most of my abusive behavior was directed at people I already knew, loved ones I was close to. It doesn‚Äôt make it better, I know. This could also be because I have really bad disorganized attachment issues as well. If I don‚Äôt break it off right away, my own issues will start to get worse later and the symptoms become unbearable.

Alright I'm just gonna fucking feeling dump here, because I can't do it to anyone since they'll think I'm crazy, because the feelings are so intense, but I think maybe on this subreddit, it's the only refuge where I will be able to do it without being judged.


You hit nail on the head :-( The ghosting hurt me so fucking much. To me this is the worst you can do to a person. And she knew that because she asked and I told her. I was more in love with my baby than I've ever been with anyone ever and **I don't say this lightly.** It took me 4 years to allow myself to feel feelings after my last relationship, and all intimacy and sex was just meaningless in all this time. Until I just stopped completely because why even if I can't feel nothing. Then the anger kicks in because that is better than feeling nothing, and I end up on some bar  trying to start a fight with the first one being an asshole every weekend, because that gave adrenaline atleast. But It was all just darkness.
Then I meet her. And she is glowing, and nothing is dark anymore. All is light and warm. When it started I fought it so hard. But she was so perfect. The sweetest, most beautiful, most thoughtful and caring person in the whole world. She was an angel send from god. And she was like me. Exactly. 1:1 same life. And she seemed even more obsessed with me than I was with her. And I just let her in and told her everything that could hurt me, and then one day she wasen't an angel but the opposite. Two times she broke the ghosting, only to tell me what would hurt the absolute most. And I can't believe It wasen't intentional, because she had asked about it and I had directly told her.
Fuck.. It was the worst pain I've ever felt, no comparison. Holy shit it hurt. And 5 months after I'm still bleeding. And I don't know what I did, or well i do.. It hurt so much when I first suspected she was pulling away, that it affected my ability to be the person I wanted to be with her, and I wasen't secure and confident like in the start. I was pretty pathetic through it all if I'm being honest. And also I didn't tell her I felt so strongly about her, but she figured it out when the pregnancy happened. And when I said I would be there for the baby, she figured it out. And that scared her. 

But after all I don't blame her. I know it was real when she said she was in love with me, and I know I hurt her or scared her to initially kick start this.

It's just so hard to let her go.",licklickRickmyballs,True,1715988720.0
1cughiv,"I can relate to this too. Before my condition got worse I met and fell in love with a guy who, while I can‚Äôt say they were perfect, was probably the kindest and most stable person I‚Äôve ever had the privilege of dating. We met online, met up in person, fell in love, and then Covid hit. And then I got SA‚Äôd by a stranger. I hadn‚Äôt been diagnosed with BPD yet, but my symptoms got so much worse. He never gave me a reason to distrust him, but I couldn‚Äôt trust anyone at that point. I got hot and cold with him. Eventually I asked to open the relationship because he was leaving for the military, and we decided to end it instead. I moved cities, got involved with the wrong crowd, started abusing drugs, and my life very quickly fell apart. 

When he and I reconnected, he told me of the traumatic things he‚Äôd been through, but he managed to overcome them and live a happy life. Meanwhile, I was unemployed and miserable. Initially I hated him for it. I lashed out and pushed him away. I was so envious of his discipline, self-control, kindness.. things I no longer had. And rather than healthily expressing any disappointment or concerns I had, I wished harm on him. He, rightfully, ghosted me after. It completely destroyed me. Someone I loved so dearly had abandoned me, or that‚Äôs how I viewed it. It took time and a lot of introspection to realize I had deeply hurt him and pushed him away. 

That was one of the things that really woke me up to how much I needed to change. The real work had to be done within. I still feel broken, but I try to remind myself that I‚Äôm not. I can rebuild. And so can you. 

We didn‚Äôt ask to have this disorder. None of us do. So many of us have been through unfathomable amounts of pain and sorrow, and as a result we develop these patterns of behavior that almost become second nature to us. It takes a lot of hard work to unlearn them and do better, but it‚Äôs not impossible. It can happen. It just takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice. 

Sobriety and cutting people out of my life who were only enabling and encouraging these bad behaviors did wonders for me. I also started being way more honest about my abusive and self destructive behavior in therapy. Being honest with others and myself has been so crucial in treatment. But fuck, it‚Äôs hard! Our disorder makes our emotions feel so strong that it‚Äôs really hard to see things objectively or from another person‚Äôs perspective. MBT and DBT have been so, so helpful with that. 

If you‚Äôre unable to seek treatment right now, there are some workbooks you can order that can help you get on track. Dr. Fox has a good one, I also recommend checking out his videos. If you don‚Äôt keep a journal, start one. Try to see where in your life you can make changes and try to improve.

Only now do I understand that it's not going to be my reality, and it's okay. Some people never experience happiness in life, but happiness isn't the only emotion out there. You can experience a feeling of accomplishment, a feeling of peace, a feeling of excitement, enjoyment, wonder. I gave up on happiness last summer after being given a book by a psychiatrist that was basically like ""People try tooo hard to seek happiness. Just stop and smell the flowers!"" or whatever. And that was so insulting it did something to my brain. I have no choice but to stay alive for my child but now I am focusing on those other feelings instead.

In late October 2023, I started seeing a new talk/couples therapist who specializes in BPD. At the same time, I started what‚Äôs called RODBT which is typically a treatment for people who lean over-controlled. 

Anyway, both new therapists saw me at the height of emotions and behaviors that resembled BPD but believed were trauma responses. They both explained that while there are similarities, their experience with BPD patients was that the frequency and severity of ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù were often and high. While I have my reservations, I feel they know best. Most importantly, I now try to see myself outside of any diagnosis and treating myself with more compassion due to trauma. Trauma is the core.

1cu9ryb,"Hii. I have a friend (let‚Äôs call her Bianca) who exhibited BPD symptoms for years. Her parents didn't pay much attention to her because her older sister, Stacy, was dealing with drug addiction and other issues. Stacy is about 13 years older than Bianca.

Their parents spent a significant amount of money on rehab for Stacy, even sending her to another country for treatment. While their family is comfortable, they aren't super wealthy, so they used Bianca‚Äôs college fund to cover Stacy's expenses. Stacy eventually recovered, got married, and is now thriving with a daughter of her own.

Meanwhile, Bianca went to university and started seeing a psychiatrist. She was shocked when the psychiatrist diagnosed her with CPTSD instead of BPD, attributing it to her childhood trauma. Bianca then discussed this with several friends, including me. We all have similar upbringings and relationships with our parents, experiencing minimal physical but evident emotional abuse. Interestingly, all of us have been professionally diagnosed with BPD, except Bianca, who was diagnosed with CPTSD.

Here are my thoughts:

You have four people with similar upbringings and symptoms.
Three were diagnosed with BPD, one with CPTSD.
Who has the correct diagnosis?

In my opinion, you should reach out to a psychiatrist who specializes in both CPTSD and BPD (perhaps even in DTD) to get a more accurate diagnosis. The differences between these disorders can be subtle, and an expert who understands both can provide the best insight.

While there can be overlap in the characteristic traits of Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), there are also some differences in how these conditions manifest. Let's compare the characteristic traits you provided in the second prompt in the context of CPTSD and BPD:

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Emotional Instability:

CPTSD: Emotional dysregulation in CPTSD often stems from traumatic experiences, leading to intense emotional responses to triggers related to past trauma. Individuals with CPTSD may experience emotional numbness or detachment as a coping mechanism, alongside sudden and overwhelming emotional reactions when triggered.

BPD: Emotional instability in BPD is a core feature, characterized by rapid and intense shifts in mood, often in response to interpersonal stressors. Individuals with BPD may experience chronic feelings of emptiness, fear of abandonment, and difficulty regulating emotions, leading to impulsive behaviors and unstable relationships.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Impulsivity:

CPTSD: While impulsivity can occur in individuals with CPTSD, it may be more directly linked to trauma-related triggers. For example, impulsive behaviors may arise as maladaptive coping mechanisms to avoid or numb overwhelming emotions or to regain a sense of control in triggering situations.

BPD: Impulsivity is a hallmark feature of BPD, often manifesting in various areas of life such as spending, substance abuse, reckless driving, self-harm, and risky sexual behavior. Impulsive actions in BPD are typically driven by emotional dysregulation and a desire to alleviate distress or avoid perceived abandonment.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


Fear of Abandonment:

CPTSD: Individuals with CPTSD may also experience a fear of abandonment, particularly if past trauma involved abandonment or betrayal. However, this fear may be more generalized and less pervasive than in BPD.

BPD: Fear of abandonment is a central and pervasive feature of BPD, often leading to frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. This fear can significantly impact relationships, behavior, and self-image.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Interpersonal Relationships:

CPTSD: Individuals with CPTSD may struggle with interpersonal relationships due to difficulties in trusting others, maintaining boundaries, and regulating emotions. Relationship challenges in CPTSD may stem from past traumatic experiences and attachment disruptions.

BPD: Unstable and intense interpersonal relationships are a core feature of BPD, characterized by idealization and devaluation of others, fear of abandonment, and a pattern of alternating between extremes of idealization and demonization in relationships.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

In summary, while CPTSD and BPD share some characteristic traits such as emotional dysregulation and difficulties in interpersonal relationships, there are also distinctions in how these traits manifest and their underlying causes. CPTSD is primarily rooted in past trauma experiences and their impact on emotional regulation and relationships, while BPD is characterized by pervasive patterns of instability in self-image, emotions, and interpersonal behavior.",SwimmerSuper1072,False,1716005642.0

1cu6c7z,"I just want to add, as this is a BPD subreddit, that stonewalling and ghosting people is considered abusive and is just one more reason significant others of BPD sufferers call people with BPD abusers. People that are not disordered do not think the same way. They just don‚Äôt. If you absolutely must go no contact with someone because your abandonment fear is too triggered to continue a relationship with someone that is establishing a healthy boundary of some sort (or just spending more time with another important person as in this situation) that you perceive as abandonment, please at least tell them why first. I see lots of comments about how others have no empathy etc. on various posts in here, and that is faulting the other person for the way YOU feel. It is not a lack of empathy for someone to spend time with a new lover instead of you. Your relationship is a separate entity. The fact that you want them to say or do something they are not, doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt have empathy, it means they can‚Äôt read minds. Tell them you are afraid they‚Äôre abandoning you and talk through it. They probably have no idea since they don‚Äôt have this kind of mindset. Empathy would not even get them there, because they wouldn‚Äôt feel the same way in your shoes. 

OP, you stated that your friend has still reached out to you but you consider it to be ‚Äúan option‚Äù versus that they really just want to talk to you because you‚Äôre their friend. So are you expecting a person to only be able to have one relationship at a time? A person with a lover can‚Äôt have a friend or vice versa? This is not healthy. Love is infinite and there is plenty to go around. You may need more reassurances than others so your relationships may need more tending, and that is 100 percent okay, but you need to talk to your friend about this and make the effort to reach out and continue doing things together.

Maybe this is a moving forward thing? Like, moving forward, how do you communicate in a healthy but clear way that you‚Äôre interested in someone? 

One thing I usually mention to people in my circle, sprinkled in during conversations to let them know my communication style, is that the best way for me to understand what a person expects from me is by communicating clearly. There are many ways this rule can be baked into daily conversations.

If they have a style that would lead to stress and mistrust, I take it as a flag red enough for me to understand it won‚Äôt work.

I know the only way to know for sure is to ask, because you never know and life is 50/50 but with the way our brains are set up, asking is such a daunting task for whatever reason and we end up letting shit slip by while we sit there wondering what could be.

But just getting out a sincere apology, saying that I think about them often and I hope they're well, often at least gave me a sense of knowing that I reached out to try and easy some of the hurt they had.

Even long overdue apologies can feel good. For instance, in high school I was bullied by this girl quite often. Many years later she was checking out at a store I worked for. She was friendly and cordial, but I didn't think much of it. She's older, she's probably grown, right? Well later that week I received a message from her on social media, with a long heartfelt apology for the way she treated me back in school. I didn't say much other than I appreciate that and that Im glad she's well. But man it felt so so so good reading that apology. I didn't need it. But getting it made me happy for myself, and happy for her.

Reach out. Do it for yourself if anything. And keep trying to forgive yourself. You did what you though was best for you at the time. You are more mature now, with more tool, and more self awareness.

Modern adults cannot be ""abandoned"" because people leaving your life don't leave you incapable of getting food/shelter/etc. You survive the loss of people in your life. NEVER use the word ""abandoned"" because it means something so extreme to your body and mind.

2. Going off meds is an unpredictable event that in NO WAY indicates ANYTHING about your underlying mental state. Any care center that fails to realize that is a place you need to never go again - especially if someone there hurt you. 

3. What other people interpret as ""drama"" is you being triggered and engaging in behaviors that are instinctual for everyone - as long as a person truly believes the situation is life-threatening. Thousands of years of tribal life made us hypersensitive to exclusion.

Our problem is that a whole LOT of things feel life-threatening because our ""trigger"" is hypersensitive from our genes/parenting/history of trauma. Our pre-programmed primitive emotions grab hold when other people wouldn't be tempted to think in such alarmist ways.

1ctan3z,"Congratulations, you have a golden opportunity to ""do the opposite"" as it is called in DBT. Please congratulate yourself when you do so. 

I'll waffle on now about my approach to it.

So, I would speculate based on my personal experience with the attachment trauma side of this, that you wish to establish and maintain contact, and that your mind is essentially ruminating obsessively about being in contact.

The problem that you have identified in your post, is that you feel empty and alone, and you conceive of contact with this person as the satisfying solution to that. I've been there.

Ironically, contact is not satisfying. While it feels good to get the validation of contact and interaction with an FP, you just need more, endlessly. Of course, you know this. But, it's worth pointing out. It's NOT satisfying. This has nothing to do with them, it's entirely to do with your mind and what it believes. The belief is that being in contact with this person will be satisfying.

This is a little ""esoteric"". I'm a Buddhist and there are certain insights in the practice of mindfulness meditation that have greatly helped me. I will share as best I can an insight in a way that you can see it. The insight is that, merely by believing that an external form of the senses is going to result in satisfaction, I feel unsatisfied. The more that I think I need something out there, and the more that I believe that I do not have these forms that I need, the more I will suffer with grief (grievances) about the present moment. 

To benefit from this understanding, one can practice mindfulness. This is exactly what I do if I have thoughts about an FP. I recognize that my mind is thinking thoughts, obsessively. I observe these thoughts without judgement, meaning I do not try to get rid of the thoughts. Merely watching the thoughts. I can then observe how the thought of a particular form that I want to possess keeps coming to mind, and how the mind keeps wanting it. I observe how in this fantasy, the form is believed to be satisfying, and that ""I"" will be enhanced when I have this form, I will be loved and good. I observe the desire for constancy of contact. I observe how bad I feel in my body when I face the fact that I cannot have constant contact.

Once you see clearly how your mind clings, you can stop unconsciously believing that you need the external, out-there, form to be complete as a person, your mind simply lets go of thinking about that external form, with a brief concluding thought on the matter, and you feel as if you have moved on. This is a *paradigm shift.* It feels like waking up from a dream. You realize that you weren't living *your* life. You realize that you forgot you were even a person in this whole equation, because you were so focused on this other person and having contact with them. It feels as if your whole conscious existence became an afterthought, a means-to-an-end, until you could get that next hit of this person. And you realize how preposterous that was, thinking ""how could I have believed I needed this other person so badly?""

Another thing I like to do is mentally redirect whatever needs I'm trying to get met from this other person, onto myself as an adult. So, I imagine my inner child focusing on this person like a parent, and I gently let the inner child know that *I'm* their parent and I will always be here for them, so it makes more sense to look to me for the need it's trying to meet by hankering for this other person.",Worried_Baker_9462,False,1715861268.0
1ctan3z,"Fellow lesbian, but almost all of my FPs have been friends only, male and female.

Whats worked for me is setting major boundaries for myself. I woukd silence and hide messages from them to reduce the need to respond right away. I actively sought other activities that took time away from my contact (in my case, discord). I made it an active effort to only check our messages once or twice a day.

At first, it was terrifyingly difficult and absolutely miserable. Then after a while I noticed it got a little easier. Then I actually found an interest that more successfully distracted me. Then I found a group of others than I vibed with. It took a lot of time, but I noticed that I actually stopped even thinking about checking messages. When I did speak, I felt less attached. There were still challenges. And in the end I ended up cutting off that person (the distance made me realize how not a good friend they were). But I utilize this early on now when I feel I'm getting overly attached and I find it working really well. 

Maybe start with self made boundaries. And try not to overthink the friend thing. It's actually not uncommon to have FPs who who aren't partners. Seeing that they're a new friend, I think its a prime time to get that boundary going now. And if he asks, be a bit candid: ""I noticed I've been on my phone(or whatever) a lot lately and Im starting to feel it's negatively impacting me, so I've decided to cut back some.""

1ct1lgv,"As someone who suffers severely for a very long time, I wanted to share that I am successfully in a relationship and engaged to a woman who accepts me for who I am and helps me push myself forward to feel better every day. Everything she does is to help me feel better and cope better. She never blames me and says how awful I am when I spiral and split. She just loves me and hugs me, and waits until I calm down and then talks to me. We're usually able to figure it out within like an hour. I don't know what I did to deserve her, but after my last two relationships leaving me because they thought I was just an awful snd too sensitive person. The second one wanted kids and said that I would be a bad mom.... My fiance now has two older boys who both love me very much, and I love them. I work constantly to not give in to borderline and to question everything I think so I can work harder to be happy. 
So I just wanted to let you guys know that there is definitely hope. I also have therapy 1-2 times weekly, as well as going on multiple support groups weekly, practicing a lot of self care and mindfulness, and telling my fianc√©e when I'm feeling the big feelings. So that before anything happens, we can handle it. I'm not saying it is easy, but it's possible. 
My therapist sent me something that says you are not unlovable. You just haven't found the right person to love you yet. I thought that was complete bull, but I guess she's right.

I also empathized a lot with all the work you have to do, and all the mental charge. I can understand how difficult it is.

1cszuvu,"10 years in therapy here. Have been pretty stable for 3 years. I used to tell people. It tended to ‚Äúallow‚Äù me to act out. It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI warned you I‚Äôm crazy so I‚Äôm going to be crazy!‚Äù It sets up a dynamic that‚Äôs hard to get out of. 

I tried something different with my BF of two years. I didn‚Äôt tell him at first. He is so extremely mentally healthy. He hasn‚Äôt triggered me once and I haven‚Äôt had an outburst in two years.. Only thing I‚Äôve struggled with is obsessive negative and insecure thoughts. Which weirdly, he completely understands and relates to. 

About 8 months in when I was finally comfortable, I told him. He didn‚Äôt believe me. He said ‚Äúbut you‚Äôre so‚Ä¶ normal? We never fight? Are you sure?‚Äù We haven‚Äôt really spoken about it much since. We talk about my feelings but he didn‚Äôt dwell on the diagnosis because he already understood me. 

BPD is not your identity. You can be in a healthy relationship with someone who doesn‚Äôt trigger you.

Use the first date to chat about your interests, ask questions, and see if you vibe. If you vibe, maybe you'll get another date and vibe more. And maybe then you'll vibe enough and feel comfortable  to share your experience with BPD. I waited until maybe date 4 or 5 to tell my boyfriend: hey ya, I really like you and I want to be really honest with you as we get to know each other. He was so open, and non-judgemental, which I knew because we'd been on other dates. I wasn't even diagnosed then, I just wanted him to be aware of my hold ups in relationships and past experiences. You don't even have to disclose your diagnosis, just your experience if that makes sense.

for me, dating was exhausting until i took time to really focus on myself and what i wanted out of a relationship. i realized i was expecting a source of endless reassurance or to distract from intense loneliness (common for BPD... lol), rather than actually focusing on qualities i wanted in a partner. during dates, i was coming off too strong and needy. i spent an extended time not actively dating to invest in myself, really assess my values and interests. when i finally tried dating again, i felt more secure about my sense of self which translated into better dating interactions. i felt less dependent on external validation and ""highs"" i would get from dating. eventually i met my current partner of 4+ years :D i always recommend some time away from dating to focus on yourself whenever dating starts to feel emotionally taxing.",angorafox,False,1715834391.0

1cszuvu,"Kudos for you for not having given up on dating.. I know I did. Single for 7 years, all my previous relationships ended mostly because of me. After that tried dating again a few times.. 

I just can't seem to comprehend ladies that well, some I hear say hate guys that are too this or too that or like this in a man or that, whatever it may be, good or bad. 

So instead of just trying to be myself on a date, I wanna come off as amazing, taking into account the do's and dont's I picked up, I mean, dating is all about selling yourself, so you want to be on your best behavior if you're gonna meet that potential special person, am I right?

So during the dating procedure my borderbrain tries remembering all the things it picked up from other women, tries to fill in the gaps, tries to interpret signals and cues, at the same time trying to notice certain behavioral changes, changes in posture, eye contact, facial expression, vocal tones,  changes in texting frequency,  changes in word use, basically constantly scanning for any possible change that can lead to me being hurt so I can use my mental ejection seat.. 

And quickly my brain starts going haywire before turning into a pinball machine of thoughts and emotions, trying not to fuck it up, but by doing so unavoidably fucking it up.. coming across as a weirdo, getting rejected or being ghosted and feeling miserable for weeks/months before picking myself up and trying again, just so I can set up that same mental trap again and spring that same trap that I set up myself.. again.

If not that I ruin it myself, it certainly feels extremely difficult as a man to correctly approach a woman these days (from my experience), giving a full disclosure of my ""condition"", it would feel, is like giving an instant death sentence to the date, let alone my brain not being able to handle ""the dating game"".. the easiest would be to find someone who, like me, is straight forward and says what he/she thinks or feels, as I find this the most soothing way for my brain to be with someone, unfortunately I haven't found anyone who wants to understand me enough of what I'm going through or can't get past those first barriers of weirdness in order to be given a proper chance to get to truly know me.. and I mean, I can't blame them, if I seem like such an exhausting hassle during dating, and my good ""features"" are not in balance with the potential risks that they might see, I kinda can understand why I'm still alone and nobody wants to take a chance with me.

Oh well, acceptance, hermitage and solitude it is! üòä But hey, if you find a way, let me know and I'll be happy to hear it! Sincerely hope you find a way, just because it is hard, doesn't mean it is impossible, I too hope for such a thing, I guess sometimes that's all someone can do, right? 

And as fucked and hopeless as I might sometimes feel, I do believe that the universe gives you opportunities if only you dare to take them.

Although this might all be written due to my current state of mind based on my current set of emotions..

1csw7dy,"Hi and welcome to Reddit ü•∞üíúü´Ç

Splitting is a psychological defence mechanism that causes you to view people, things, ideas or situations etc in extreme terms. When you split there is no or very little ‚Äòmiddle/grey ground‚Äô, they‚Äôre either completely bad or completely good; Black & White. This is useful from an evolutionary standpoint because if you‚Äôre very sure of something you can act on it with confidence. 

Due to brain wiring and/or trauma, pwBPD (people with BPD) sense danger in the wrong places, and do not sense danger in the appropriate places, so B&W thinking doesn‚Äôt serve us very well. Typically, in the case of trauma, splitting was likely useful to us at some point in the past, but it isn‚Äôt anymore. As such it‚Äôs become a maladaptive coping mechanism.

I think you‚Äôre perhaps conflating emotional instability with splitting.",attimhsa,False,1715813371.0

There has been another issue in our relationship that almost made me leave (has to do with severe porn addiction and repeated lying/betrayal on his part) and ever since he saw me wanting to leave and actually turning cold and heartless, he really got a wake up call and hasn‚Äôt dared to do anything after. So I believe there might be hope, I just gotta set a big enough of a boundary that actually puts fear in him and makes him take it seriously. 

We have been to couples therapy for the addiction issue but it really didn‚Äôt help us, it was rather uncomfortable and triggered my anxiety immensely as the therapist was a bad match. We both just felt ashamed and wanted out. 

It is heartbreaking that I‚Äôm so dependent on him, mostly emotionally. I don‚Äôt know if I will ever be able to leave but I at least hope that one day I‚Äôll have the same cold and heartlessness that I did that one time. So in a sense there‚Äôs hope, that there will be a point where the pot boils over for me as it has happened before, maybe then he will either realize it‚Äôs a dealbreaker or I will have the strength to get out.",Melindish,True,1715893010.0

Yeah I understand. Money is tough especially if he doesn‚Äôt have health insurance.

No it‚Äôs okay! Therapy has definitely helped me learn from my most relationship. I know that in every toxic relationship, both parties are always at fault. The way I acted wasn‚Äôt right, but I can‚Äôt help, but feel guilty. At the same time, I romanticized him so much to the point where I tried to change him into someone he‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm definitely being hard on myself! Every time someone talks about their toxic bf/ex, I‚Äôm like dang I did that too‚Ä¶ It sucks, but at moments where I get mad, I don‚Äôt think, I just do. Luckily I am able to become self aware and change while I‚Äôm still young. I know I‚Äôm hard on myself, but you know, it‚Äôs tough accepting that the past can‚Äôt change and forgiving yourself is hard too.

I hope that one day is nearby for you. Yes, for sure! Everyone always has something they should work on. Every human has flaws. It‚Äôs just sometimes putting two hurting people together makes things tough.

For now, I hope you can endure everything and communicate with him how you‚Äôre actually feeling. I hope he doesn‚Äôt become reactive to you talking about your feelings. If he does act out, call him out-see? Why are you not letting me express myself? This is how I feel and I can‚Äôt help, but feel the way I feel. Things like that. I hope things can get better, I‚Äôm sorry you have to go through this.

Of course! Remember words are just words.

1csrcee,"You're not alone Extra\_Put\_3780. There was a time in my life (before my diagnosis, especially) when almost *nothing* I said was true. Through talk and DBT therapy though, I learned why I was so accustomed to lying and strategies for telling the truth.

People don't often talk about it, but compulsive lying is a lot like an addiction. There are usually reasons behind it that must be addressed before it can be overcome. That's how I learned to manage it: One day at a time. 

I'll admit that I still catch myself embellishing a story here and there, usually to make my husband laugh, but I try really hard to stick to the truth as much as possible; and I find that my life is much easier when I do, because I'm not harboring the additional shame that comes with feeling like a liar -- or the fear of being caught in a lie.

Try asking for what you need from people instead of making up stories to manipulate their emotions. You'll find that there's freedom in it. I would also suggest talking to a therapist. It's more helpful than I can put into words.

But I would leave the serious work to professionals if he wants help. Let him come to you, be reassuring when he needs it! Always! 

My fianc√©e has been with me for nearly three years! The longest and most stable relationship I‚Äôve had. And I went through so many relationships growing up. She‚Äôs been very understanding of my habits, thought processes, and even cycles of emotions I can gravitate towards depending on the circumstances at those times. I‚Äôve been doing therapy for over a year now, and tackling Dialectal Behavior Therapy to have better coping strategies for myself as well as understanding how to regulate my emotions. She even does therapy herself. So it‚Äôs definitely been a two way street with us on growing together as well as independently. 

I‚Äôve been in therapy working through my own struggles with BPD for a good portion of my life undiagnosed until now, and my therapist has been going through Dialectal Behavior Therapy with me, which honestly has been well for me so far. I also have been diagnosed with cPTSD when I was 16. I deal with feeling intense emotions at very stressful times, which had reoccurring patterns of me having emotional displacements. I also let my emotions, doubts, and fears drive me to the point of ‚Äújumping ship‚Äù for things such as stable work, schooling, and maintaining friendships. Even if I‚Äôm experiencing something intensely difficult or unfair/irrational behaviors from others, I‚Äôm learning dealing with said serious issues (Ex: Your boss/coworker mistreating you, family mistreating you, trauma, or anything that‚Äôs unhealthy on the receiving end) that I am accountable for how I respond to it all. A lot of it though comes from taking initiative yourself and applying what you‚Äôre learning in DBT. Outside of emotional displacements such as anger, doubt, or fear, the depression gets real intense for me. That would make me over analyze events, people, and myself, making me ‚Äúshut off‚Äù to everything around me, so I would isolate myself. I let my traumas define me in such negative ways growing up, and it‚Äôs been learning to love myself properly the last 10+ years. I was my own enemy throughout my struggles with BPD as well as traumas I‚Äôve endured. Therapy has helped me immensely. And it does get better!

Seriously. Healthy distractions are one of the best tools for BPD. Explore everything that piques your interest. Find hobbies or games or music or sports or books or movies or communities that feel good to you. It'll be awkward, and fighting a lack of motivation can be hard. You can take your time. But the best way to stop BPD from consuming your mind  is to push it out and replacing it with other things that take your time and focus.

And the one thing I‚Äôm sure you won‚Äôt want to hear is what‚Äôs true, that that person isn‚Äôt good for you despite how much you love and care for them or vice versa. Sometimes we continue to talk to them and go back thinking if we‚Äôre better, they‚Äôre better or the circumstances are better it could be healthy. But we learn time and time again that someone who has that power over you leads you to continue to fall no-matter how much progress you‚Äôve made, because at some point they became a major trigger. I can definitely say I continued to speak to my major trigger person over periods of years to maintain a connection that justified my lasting pain from them still, to continue to try to get validation for the progress I had made, as well as the undying fear for years that the world without this person was not livable. But before you know it, you already are living without them, and it sounds like you‚Äôre actually doing better without them too. Your reasoning for staying in contact could differ, but all in all it becomes addictive and that high that you feel after getting back in contact starts feeling like withdrawal real quickly. It will take your own time, growth and lots of of readapting to break the cycle, but one day you will be feeling so great that reaching out to them and the risk of the pain won‚Äôt be worth it anymore. Sometimes people become self harm and I had a hard time learning that too. I haven‚Äôt spoken to my major trigger person in a couple years now, I remember thinking that was impossible, but now there‚Äôs nothing in the world that could make me want to risk talking to someone who I would hand all of my self control over to. I tried to make it casual, I tried to be friendly, I tried every attempt at making that relationship something that could be healthy until I took my emotions out of it and looked at the obvious correlation again and again.

I know one day you‚Äôll find the hindsight to see that and it seems like you already do, which is huge in itself. This person won‚Äôt dictate your well being forever, and they‚Äôll stop having the power to when you stop engaging out of love for yourself. I deeply feel for you as this was the story of my life for such a long time, but I promise that there is a time where it won‚Äôt be yours anymore. When you find it in yourself to set that boundary with this person, someone you don‚Äôt want to imagine life without, and you see the benefits of that over time, you will learn from it and future people will never have that same type of hold over you again because you will recognize it sooner and have this experience as an example. With BPD we will always struggle of course, but when you get through the barrier of that one person that feels like the beginning and end of your world, it gives you more confidence in yourself. Trust me, if I got there somehow, you eventually will too. And spoiler: my trigger person was impacting my mental health more than anything, wasn‚Äôt a great person outside of my glowing perspective and of course, ultimately wasn‚Äôt worth it. He was a serious long distance boyfriend of many years from Toronto who come to find out had been cheating and living with a girl in Texas behind my back for years. He had ‚Äònever been to America‚Äô and I always went to see him. I live in Michigan, so imagine my surprise hahaha. Now I can laugh about it, a few years ago I would‚Äôve been on the AIAA forum asking why it‚Äôs my fault. The people we give the most power to are just powerless strangers in the real world. I wish you so much healing and while I probably don‚Äôt have the right words for everything you need to hear, I know through experience that this person, those memories and that connection won‚Äôt dictate your well being forever. You‚Äôre stronger than you know, protect your mind and heart and eventually, one day, you‚Äôll find people you can talk to just as openly and happily without the risk of everything else you‚Äôve worked for. It might feel lonely at times, but that person isn‚Äôt getting you through anything like you think, it‚Äôs you, it‚Äôs all been you. You are all you need and if you support and validate yourself, you don‚Äôt need a second opinion from someone whose opinion really doesn‚Äôt matter anyway. That person doesn‚Äôt have to live your life and be inside your brain. We‚Äôll never hear what we want to hear from them especially if they don‚Äôt struggle so greatly to make progress like we do, so every time you don‚Äôt engage should be looked at as self care and protection - because that‚Äôs what it really is.

I needed people to express to me (repeatedly) that I have good and even great qualities, that I am not a burden, and that they will stick around even if the situation gets a little unpleasant at times becaue they value me. I needed to hear it first from others before I could believe it, which is really hard to do when I isolate, so it took a long time to make those personal connections and then trust. I didn't think I could do the self-love thing either, but it turned out that it became accessible when I finally started believing I might not be all the negative things I thought I was. Having the proper support is pivotal, too. I finally found a great psychiatrist that I vibe with like I never thought possible. I think I've found a great therapist now, too. It's still a newer relationship, but she's invested, has diverse training, and has shown her willingness to meet me where I am each session with compassion and acceptance.

Unlike what we are told in social media, things like ‚Äòstimming‚Äô, sensitivities, social problems, etc., are found in most persons with non-autistic mental health disorders and at high rates in the general population. These things do not necessarily suggest autism.

¬†

So-called ‚Äúautism‚Äù tests, like AQ and RAADS and others have high rates of false positives, labeling you as autistic VERY easily. If anyone with a mental health problem, like depression or anxiety, takes the tests they score high even if they DON‚ÄôT have autism.

I got diagnosed about 2 years ago as well,  and thats like a rough estimate like give or take a month. I was diagnosed in my early 20‚Äôs when i was in rehab. 

The person I was with (partner of 3 years by then)and someone i lived with a the time. He would use it to dismiss my emotions, and in his mind categorize them as manipulative and fabrication for my own gain, and label himself as a victim. 

I wont pretend or say im an angel, as i know that to be not true. However, I did all to be emotionally stable and he never even tried. 

The point is wish to make is that you really must be careful, as borderline is still very much misunderstood. 

Like many other disorders that get falsely portrayed in media, and have many times negative connotations attached i think it is best to safeguard yourself. 

Your mental sanctity and wellbeing should be at the forefront of your priorities. I hope any of what i said made sense, and i truly with you the best.

It was a rude customer, so I didn‚Äôt feel extremely bad after, but I was really shocked when I realized I had finally exploded on someone.

So instead of feeling really apologetic, I felt ashamed and shocked cuz I have always been considered a ‚Äúquiet‚Äù bpd.
The good news is that just like all our other feelings, anger is one you‚Äôre able to regulate. When we‚Äôre about to laugh, we smile. When we‚Äôre about to cry, our eyes water and our faces get hot. Anger has warning signs too, for me I get shaky, focused and all my hairs stand up. So I‚Äôve been trying to pick up when I‚Äôm getting angry, so I can walk away from the trigger, and try to calm down my body. I‚Äôve noticed the things that make me so angry are usually things that remind me of something that was once done to me. Again, bringing up the example of the stranger, the reason she really got to me is because it reminded me of one of the many ways my mum would fight and abuse me. So working on trauma is also good, but we always are haha.

Now you‚Äôre starting to feel how life is supposed to feel like, you‚Äôll find yourself a lot more emotional about everything.

1crqbjt,"I‚Äôve been diagnosed and in treatment for 7 years, have had periods of stability with great success but regardless inevitably when it rains, it pours. While I can‚Äôt relate to every specific as it‚Äôs a unique situation, my partner of 6 years broke up with me last year and never talked to me again and before that I was in a long distance relationship for years that tore me to shreds, and have lost my long term friendships due to reasons out of my control as well. Specifically with the long distance relationship, that‚Äôs a person that I finally learned would always cause me to backtrack. We have hope and believe that if we‚Äôre better, their better or the circumstances are better that we can have them in our lives and be healthy when ultimately the people who have that power over you aren‚Äôt healthy for you. Sometimes one message is all it takes to be at rock bottom again. With friends and needing support it‚Äôs natural to run to these people thinking they will help, and if we‚Äôre lucky they are kind and compassionate, but often times they aren‚Äôt and it makes the loneliness feel more severe than before. No matter how much progress we make with BPD, we‚Äôre naturally inclined to feel the weight of the world when it‚Äôs bad and I‚Äôm sure so many of us can relate. Regardless of what the world is throwing at you and how unfair it really is, I ask you to remind yourself that you are the person who gets you through everything, you are so much stronger than you think, a lot of times we credit stability or success to friendships and relationships when it‚Äôs never been those people getting you through, it‚Äôs been you. When we can talk ourselves off the ledge, then we‚Äôre left with having to find a way to survive. When your in survival mode and rebuilding yourself back up, remember the things that brought you down and avoid them even if you love them, they bring you comfort, etc. Easier said than done, but the sooner you recognize your triggers the sooner you can save yourself a lot of the pain of the cycle of it all, those patterns become addicting no matter the pain. But we can‚Äôt avoid all unfortunate circumstances and pain and with BPD we will feel them 1000x harder than most, so give yourself grace in knowing you are not alone - there‚Äôs a whole group of people here who truly understand, the things that happened to you are not your fault and please baby yourself and take care of yourself first as you just experienced deep trauma. People can be awful, circumstances can be painfully unfair and it can often feel there‚Äôs no way out but that‚Äôs when we need to baby ourselves the most and be gentle with ourselves because like I said, we will all always have ourselves, you get you through everything, you are your person and all you need. You are stronger than you can imagine and sometimes our greatest rock bottom is actually a turning point. I‚Äôm sending you so much love and praying for you, I hope you can heal, find your strength and that nobody gets the advantage of destroying such a wonderful person.

Now that I have been in the hospital for a su1cide attempt, the crises intensified even more, to the point where I had 4 in a single day. They usually last from 10 to 25 minutes and leave me extremely tired, almost in a sort of catatonic state in which all i want to do is sleep it off.

Since I was thinking of missing highs, I was thinking of extreme feelings, and the DSM links BPD to the exact opposite of euphoria, it was a term that made sense to use in its colloquial usage.

Obviously that doesn't make it necessarily correct but maybe that line of thought can help you make sense of why others are using it as well.. though, to be honest, I sort of doubt there's as much to it for others and it's likely just a combination of the colloquial usage of euphoria = mood high and seeing other people use it that way.",apidaexylocopa,True,1715665465.0

1cravpl,"As someone who is highly versed in psychological research studies, I wanted to just lyk that it is a bit of a requirement (for a valid, open survey) to ask the same type of questions in multiple ways. This is to try and weed out people who might just be clicking consistent/random answers. This is typically done to show consistency (or lack there off) with related answers. The same can be said for questions that negate past questions (I.e. ‚ÄúI do well in large crowds‚Äù vs ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do well in large crowds‚Äù). 

When surveys are open to be taken by nearly anyone with any agenda, there are loads of factors that must be taken into account to be valid in terms of use for research. This is specifically due to the lack of control over the participants (who they are, their demographic, their intent, truth vs lies‚Ä¶ the list is extensive). 

It‚Äôs never to try and undermine your ability to perceive the similarities in questions, just part of all the specifics that need to be accounted for in research. 

Surveys are tricky this way and are some of the most difficult to manage in these senses. And sometimes people infer different things about questions and view them as being different when they‚Äôre worded slightly different like the example above. (That might be a slightly just me thing though. I second guess my understanding of questions wayyyyyy too much) 

Just wanted to share that info & shed a little light there. I agree w you on everything else you said though. I too think everyone is special in their own way, fucked up or not. I also believe the same when it comes to talent‚Ä¶ I think everyone has something they are really good at in their own unique way and I include myself in that, even when I‚Äôm having identity crises. 

It does seem a bit geared towards cluster b and other stereotypes and I definitely think some of the questions could have been  worded a bit better. However, it does say that it‚Äôs been approved so it must hold up in the research community. Besides, no in is perfect and it‚Äôs a long survey. I‚Äôm just happy to see research done, even if it‚Äôs slightly skewed. 

What comes to mind for me is that the person who designed/wrote the survey may not know first or second hand experience with bpd and likely does get influenced by stereotypes or the very large umbrella that the dsm (or other countries versions) covers.

1cqz7t3,"I completely feel this!!!!!

Ive recently been diagnosed with BPD myself. I also was diagnosed with cPTSD at the age of 16 due to traumatic events I never got help with nor closure with. I‚Äôm 28 now, so the majority of my life prior to this year being diagnosed, my emotional displacements and irregularities have been the most challenging aspect of my life. My unstable development and unsupportive environment was also a huge catalyst to my mental health condition worsening. 

I‚Äôve been doing therapy for almost a year now. Mind you, I haven‚Äôt been in therapy since I was 17 (10+ years ago). I have been dealing with the near same exact feelings you yourself have.

1. Wanting a calm and stress-free environment to ensure my ‚Äústability‚Äù moreso.
2. Going two steps up, just to be knocked back ten steps down when depression, stress, and or triggers occur through events that are difficult for myself.
3. Being fearful of moving forward with myself in life, all while knowing I have the competency and capacity to do so. It‚Äôs just the fears of the ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù or dwelling on past things that can ‚Äúpause‚Äù me into a state of feeling like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Äù. 

I‚Äôve mentioned these issues with my therapist about four months ago, because my life felt as if it was going down-down. I had less emotional resilience to my triggers, developed more bad habits that contributed to my depression/anger/anxiety, and just had this massive dissociation overall with myself. I saw that psychotherapy would be recommended in my situation. I mentioned it to my therapist and she completely agreed and was happy to see that I‚Äôm taking initiative to myself.

She recommended Dialectal Behavior Therapy to start with. Gave me a book for it too. I read it from time to time, take notes, apply the practice and reflect on it with her. I‚Äôve been seeing a huge difference in how I regulate my feelings. Before DBT, I would always fester into my feelings and argue about things such as unjustly and irrational treatment I received from people and family, people contradicting themselves while having high expectations from me, dwelling on trauma in an unhealthy way, etc. This process so far with DBT has been teaching me how to understand my triggers and how to mitigate my reactions from them, building better resiliences mentally for it all. As well as truly understanding these feelings and why I process these feeling so intensely, it all can stem from something. It also has been teaching me how to let go of the ‚Äúcontrol factor‚Äù for life, even if I am being completely rational with these expectations; learning that I only have control in MY life.

Examples of things that are IN control of my life:
1. The amount of effort I put in
2. My words
3. My actions
4. How I treat others
5. Whether or not I follow rules
6. How I handle my feelings
7. My decisions
8. How I take care of myself

Examples of things that are OUT of my control:
1. What other people do
2. What other people say
3. Things from the past
4. How other people feel
5. Other people‚Äôs choices
6. The weather (lol)

My overall opinion about DBT, I would say I‚Äôve made massive steps and strides with myself. I‚Äôm reprogramming myself in positive ways. I‚Äôm able to stay in the ‚Äúnow‚Äù without worrying about the future nor dwelling in the past as much. I‚Äôm able to process my feelings better and catch myself when I‚Äôm starting to ‚Äúrev up‚Äù into my emotions when something triggers me. I‚Äôm being more active and forcing routine into my life to have better and healthier coping strategies, as well as learning new coping and soothing strategies to avoid emotional displacements and irrational choice making. It‚Äôs been unreal to be honest. My family sees a difference in me too, which they are happy about. Sure my days aren‚Äôt always perfect, there will be slip ups. But it‚Äôs about the bounce back and refocus. Acknowledge the error, move on and make a valiant effort into doing better the next time! This is where I feel the quote, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre only human‚Äù comes into play healthily.

1cqvgbq,"I don't know the answer, but I can make an observation for you.

Your post contains the belief that what you experienced previously was ""love"", and that if you do not experience that then you do not love your girlfriend.

And it seems like if you are not feeling that feeling that you label as ""love"", that you feel anxious, avoidant and like you're dying.

So, it sounds like you're basically very dependent on personally experiencing that feeling of love in order to feel relief from anxiety.

I actually think I've experienced what you are referring to. In my case, what I conceived of as ""love"" was just obsession with a person, having projected a maternal figure that I made up onto them. I wanted to establish and maintain contact with this maternal figure as if I were a baby that needed its mother. How nice it felt to expect abandonment and to not be. But, how interesting, once I felt that I would not be abandoned by this person, I couldn't play my little game of winning over my ""mother"" who abandoned me and get the feelings involved in that. In my experience, if in this cycle I am not experiencing the fear of abandonment, I am experiencing instead the **fear of engulfment.** Approach-avoidance repetition compulsion.

1cqvgbq,"I experience this same issue in my marriage. What ***I*** have to do is ask myself certain questions. When I have good (or bad) news, who's the first person I want to tell? Who is it that I want to come home to at the end of the day? Who do I consider my best friend? Simple questions that give me a reality barometer into my relationship. Fortunately, for me, the answer to those questions is always Michael, my husband. That's the true essence of love, in my estimation.

***My*** borderline personality disorder is (rather dysfunctionally) tied to sex, which is linked to lust and passion and desire -- things that are not always present in a long-term relationship. It's easy for me to get distracted by things that seem ""new and shiny"". By people who make me feel a spark that by comparison has dulled in my relationship at home; but, the reality is true intimacy is hard. Once someone knows that I have faults and flaws, *I* feel less desirable which I then project onto the other person (i.e. my husband), thinking ""he finds me less desirable"", and then I start to question my feelings for him.

All relationships -- even non-romantic ones -- are hard, even for ""normies"" who don't have to deal with our personality disorder issues. What you have to come to terms with is understanding your needs *and* your disorder. It's a maddening dance, but once you learn to master the steps, it does get easier.

1cqsq14,"My childhood and pre-teen years were very traumatic. For a number of years, I lived in fear of my mother's boyfriend. Almost every night, my sister and I would hear him SA my mom. I truly believed he would eventually snap and kill us. We also lived in an area of Los Angeles where we often would hear murders in the back alley or have scary people wander into our backyard. I did experience SA as a child for many years, but it was another child who did it, so I didn't necessarily feel traumatized as a kid by it because I had no idea what was happening or that it was wrong but as an adult it is extremely traumatizing and I'm so disturbed by it. I think about it every single day. 

This might sound ridiculous, depending on whether you believe in this kind of stuff, but when I was 5, I lived in a house that my mother, sister, and I believed was haunted by a demon. Horrible things happened in that house that were completely unexplainable, like things moving on their own right in front of our eyes, strange symbols would appear on the mirror when we showered, we would hear eachothers screams but no one would be screaming. Every night, about 20 cats would come scratch on my windows and meow in distress so loudly that I couldn't sleep. One day, the three of us fell to the floor because it felt as if the entire house had dropped 6ft into the ground, but it hadn't. Absolutely nothing had happened, it's the strangest thing I've ever felt. We also had extremely bad luck while living there. We were in a really bad car accident. Our pets were attacked and killed on multiple occasions. Very strange men would come to the door when I was left home alone, and they would just stand outside, knocking for what felt like forever. I'd have to hide in the storage closet and just cry until the knocking stopped. I was so terrified in that house that I would get dressed for kindergarten in my closet with the door just barely cracked open so I could look out into my room and make sure no one was watching. Whatever was causing all of this seemed as if it was feeding off of my mom's boyfriend's negative energy. He was so evil in that house, more so than usual. I couldn't look at him because I felt like I was staring at the devil. He took pleasure in watching us suffer. He threatened to kill us all in our sleep if my mom tried to move us out, but eventually, he ended up needing to move for work, so we were able to leave. While we lived there, that was the only time I ever had an issue with wetting the bed.

My OCD was actually the last thing to be diagnosed but looking back it is the first thing that I showed symptoms with growing up and has actually led to some of the more severe mental health crisis that I've had. For me, the part that really helped me understand OCD was that it kind of showed up as ""potentially real or smart behaviors"" that would subtly grow into kind of off paranoia. It was easy to miss bc it wasn't as profound as some of the other things. My own experience is that undiagnosed OCD and ADHD basically led to cycles of trauma and gaslighting, which then later led to to CPTSD and BPD. But BPD and CPTSD were easy to diagnose at that point, and then it was only after I had better emotional regulation and distress tolerance skills that I could kind of ""hear"" the underlying and familiar OCD rumination patterns. Also, for what it's worth, I think there's a strong correlation between PTSD/BPD and increasing of OCD symptoms so because I suffered for so long without treatment, my OCD actually grew to be the most pressing issue bc it started to drive patterns of relapse from states of remission from both BPD and CPTSD.

1cqqy1q,"It broke my heart reading this because I, too, subconsciously blocked out most of my childhood. I could remember some things to where I knew my childhood wasn't the greatest, but I had no idea how severe the abuse really was. I spent most of my life wondering why I had so many mental struggles. I told myself that others had much worse childhoods and that I shouldn't be depressed or anxious because mine wasn't that bad in comparison. I still believe others have  had it worse. There's always someone who's had it worse than you, but that will never diminish what you experienced. 

Going into adulthood, I began to really question certain things internally. My mental health was at an all-time low, and I started to realize that something was very seriously wrong. I tried to dig deep into my memory to find the missing puzzle pieces. Slowly but surely, certain things began to make sense. The memories of my mom constantly leaving my sibling and I alone when we were just children so that she could go be with her abusive boyfriend who would commonly threaten to beat us although he never did. We were manipulated to believe my mother was leaving us to protect us from him so that he wouldn't come to our house. Unlocking this memory made it clear to me that, that was far from the truth. We were neglected. 

Even after my sibling moved out and it was just me left at home, I was dragged through all of my mom's abusive relationships. Forced to witness abuse again and again. Constantly being leaned on by my mother. I was the one who had to tell her it was okay even though I was a child, dying inside. 

None of that was the worst of it. When I turned 21, I had a discussion with my sibling. I somehow was able to build up the courage to ask what happened within all those little gaps in my memory. And I finally knew. I knew why I grew up with a broken mind that could never develop as a normal child's mind would. I was sexually abused, and I didn't even know it until I was an adult. My sibling was, too. All because my mother left us alone time and time again.

All I ever get from my mother is ""I'm sorry I screwed up my kids, but I just did the best that I could."" I grew up believing it, and because of that, I've had a close bond with her all my life. Living with the memories of what she caused is agonizing, and yet I can't tell her what happened to me when she wasn't looking because I don't want to hurt her...

So yes, it is very possible that your mind has tried to protect you by blocking your abuse, neglect, traumas, etc. I often wonder if I'm glad I found out or if it just destroyed me even more, but now, at least, I know why I'm such a broken person and I don't have to blame myself anymore.",momokawaii666,False,1715583563.0

That said, physical and sexual abuse is not the only type of abuse. I think a better way to think about this is that people with BPD almost always are raised in an *emotionally invalidating environment*. For instance, I myself was never physically or sexually abused. I had a generally okay childhood. But I have come to understand and accept 30 years later that I was emotionally neglected. To some, that will also classify as abuse. I personally prefer to use ""neglect"" for myself.

""Abuse"" aside, do you feel that perhaps your upbringing was neglectful or emotionally invalidating? Perhaps that may feel more ""correct"" to you than abuse. I think it's quite understated how just emotional neglect in the early years can present as trauma later down the road.

And no matter what‚Äîeveryone's BPD is different. I personally don't believe that you necessarily need to remember trauma or find trauma to work on your symptoms.

It would be even worse if they did it on purpose in a moral way I guess, but the effect on you are real, if they meant to do it or not. All of this, you should talk about with your therapist.

They apparently hear it all the time ;-) To get back to your main question: I had a lot of psychotherapy bevor actual treatment for the BPD.

*you are never just crazy*.

trauma is trauma no matter how mild or severe. 
if you like to read, i'd recommend the book Running On Empty by Dr. Jonice Webb. you can also listen to the back from the borderline podcast's series on Childhood Emotional Neglect that discusses all the different types of emotionally neglectful parenting styles from the book. it might help you understand your trauma better. best of luck on your journey, it's not an easy one <3",Jazzarino2606,False,1715614776.0

1cqqy1q,"For me, yes. Although it isn't entirely for me. I was abused by my ex step dad (everything but sexual) as well as outside the house at the same time (sexually) by a man who once called himself my ex step dad's step dad. He lived next door to us so there was no escape and it was literally almost everyday from the time I was six until I was nine almost ten. After the divorce when it all came out that I was being sexually abused my mom fell into a deep depression and started verbally and emotionally abusing me because I had ruined her happy ending. She was convinced for years that he was her one true love. When I was diagnosed and my therapist told me it stemmed from what those men did it was such a relief and yet filled me with so much resentment for my family.

My family gaslit me so badly after everything that I literally started to believe I had dreamed of the abuse because they refused to acknowledge it in any way, shape, or form. They acted like whenever I started to act a certain way (which was probably from the BPD as well as my PTSD) that I was just being a terrible child. Like I was being difficult to be difficult and like my raw emotions and sensitive mind was just me being a crybaby that needed to grow up and act her age. My childhood left me so screwed up it's ridiculous. My mom also would've rather cut off her own arm than admit my time living with that man wasn't a living nightmare for me both in the home and out of the home. With my diagnosis and what my therapist had shed the light on, my mom now at least acts remorseful for everything that happened. I'm not sure if she really means it, but either way she can't argue with me now and she knows it.

As for me, identifying the traumas helped me feel relief and validation. Sure, I also feel anger and resentment with each new answer but at least I have that answer and the relief and validation that comes with it. This includes answers as big as any new diagnosis or as small as a 'no that's not normal'. I'm planning on getting tested for ADHD and autism soon since I know it's incredibly possible that I have one or the other if not both. My family is very much the type to rather stick their heads in the sand like ostriches and be in complete denial that there's anything wrong with them. They would rather die than rest while sick or, god forbid, they go to an actual doctor over anything. Hell, my mom swore up and down that the school was wrong and I didn't need glasses when I was little. She ranted all the way until my appointment with the eye doctor and low and behold guess who needed glasses. I also have static in my vision that I've had for as long as I can remember and I just found out that that's not normal. But my mom told me it was when I asked years ago before I even found out about needing glasses just so she wouldn't have to deal with it or me.

1cqqy1q,"I didn‚Äôt read the other replies but in my opinion that isn‚Äôt crazy at all! I got diagnosed about 3 years ago and have dealt with the same exact thing until recently.
So growing up I dealt with traumas such as sickness in the family, living with other family during that period, my parents arguing heavily, drinking and smoking a lot, etc. They never physically or sexually abused me though and I am pretty close with my family to this day! But after my diagnosis I felt the need to knit pick every thing that had ever happened to me because I wanted my diagnosis and emotions to make sense and be validated. All that ended up doing for me was causing some severe arguments between my parents and I, never any answers. I spun myself in circles for about 2 years and convinced myself several times it wasn‚Äôt BPD because I couldn‚Äôt find enough trauma to support it. I‚Äôve called my mother a narcissist (she is not but she does have undiagnosed BPD for sure) and have came at my father angrily several times. 
In reality, it doesn‚Äôt matter how it happened but how to deal with the emotions and move forward now. Focus your energy on bettering yourself instead of digging the wound deeper by finding reasons to be ‚Äúbroken‚Äù. I do this by focusing on my emotions and what they mean, not so much what caused them. So if I start to get worked up my main goal is to recognize if it is anxiety, anger, sadness, or what have ya. Then the next step I take is trying to rationalize if the emotion should be reacted on. How you feel towards a situation is never a bad thing, but how you react with that emotion is what can be bad. So if you get really angry try not to focus on what caused it but how to feel the emotion and get past it in the most healthy way for you and those around you!

I‚Äôve been there. My ex was abusive, cheated on me and a man-child. He would basically SA me and grope me even after I would say no. One day I‚Äôve had enough and slapped him, this is how the physical abuse started. And btw for the nonbpd lurkers: this is a gross oversimplification of my relationship.

I‚Äôve had multiple therapist tell me that I am basically unhinged or that I trigger certain responses from him. Basically I too was always left to wonder:

Is it my borderline?

Is he violent and aggressive?

I felt like his behavior would become justifiable because I was acting a certain way too. 

This is so unfair because our emotions may be stronger but they‚Äôre based on something. And me getting hit in the face and crying was definitely not an overreaction. 

Because of the stigma but also the illness it‚Äôs easy to put us in a ‚Äòcrazy box‚Äô of unhealthy and unhinged behavior. The myth that our responses and reactions are always irrational makes us believe that they are. That we must be the problem, we provoke abuse.

Well I‚Äôm sick of it tbh.

We can be unhealthy and extreme, but your emotions and feelings are valid. It‚Äôs just what you do with them.

I should‚Äôve left my ex way before and this way I would‚Äôve avoided many incidents. But I didn‚Äôt, because my BPD must provoke this kind of behavior and therefore I deserve it. 

I think your therapist hasn‚Äôt said this for no reason. I would seriously suggest thinking a bit deeper about the situation. If you‚Äôre being emotionally abused you need to leave and end the relationship. You don‚Äôt deserve abuse, no matter what. I suggest talking it over with your therapist again and be open to what they might say. It‚Äôs not always pretty but necessary.

1cqizqx,"Diagnostic Features¬†

The essential feature of borderline personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and mood, and marked impulsivity that begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.¬†

Criterion 1: Individuals with BPD make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. The perception of impending separation or rejection, or the loss of external structure, can lead to profound changes in self-image, mood, cognition, and behavior. These individuals are very sensitive to environmental circumstances. They experience intense abandonment fears and inappropriate anger even when faced with a realistic time-limited separation or when there are unavoidable changes in plans (e.g., sudden despair in reaction to a clinician‚Äôs announcing the end of the hour; panic or fury when someone important to them is just a few minutes late or must cancel an appointment). They may believe that this perceived abandonment implies they are bad. These abandonment fears are related to an intolerance of being alone and a need to have other people with them. Their frantic efforts to avoid abandonment may include impulsive actions such as self-mutilating or suicidal behaviors, which are described separately in Criterion 5.¬†

Criterion 2: Individuals with BPD have a pattern of unstable and intense relationships. They may idealize potential caregivers or lovers at the first or second meeting, demand to spend a lot of time together, and share the most intimate details early in a relationship. However, they may switch quickly from idealizing other people to devaluing them, feeling that the other person does not care enough, does not give enough, or is not ‚Äúthere‚Äù enough. These individuals can empathize with and nurture other people, but only with the expectation that the other person will ‚Äúbe there‚Äù in return to meet their own needs on demand. These individuals are prone to sudden and dramatic shifts in their view of others, who may alternatively be seen as beneficent supports or as cruelly punitive. Such shifts often reflect disillusionment with a caregiver whose nurturing qualities had been idealized or whose rejection or abandonment is expected.¬†

Criterion 3: There may be an identity disturbance characterized by markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self. There are sudden and dramatic shifts in self-image (e.g., suddenly changing from the role of a needy supplicant for help to that of a righteous avenger of past mistreatment). Although they usually have a self-image that is based on the feeling of being bad or evil, individuals with this disorder may at times have feelings that they do not exist at all. This can be both painful and frightening to those with this disorder. Such experiences usually occur in situations in which the individual feels a lack of a meaningful relationship, nurturing, and support. These individuals may show worse performance in unstructured work or school situations. This lack of a full and enduring identity makes it difficult for the individual with BPD to identify maladaptive patterns of behavior and can lead to repetitive patterns of troubled relationships.¬†

Criterion 4: Individuals with borderline personality disorder display impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging. They may gamble, spend money irresponsibly, binge eat, abuse substances, engage in unsafe sex, drive recklessly, etc.

Criterion 5: Individuals with this disorder display recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats, or self-mutilating behavior. Recurrent suicidal thoughts or behavior are often the reason that these individuals present for help. These self-destructive acts are usually precipitated by threats of separation or rejection or by expectations that the individual assume increased responsibility. Self-mutilative acts (e.g., cutting or burning) are very common and may occur during periods in which the individual is experiencing dissociative symptoms. These acts often bring relief by reaffirming the individual‚Äôs ability to feel or by expiating the individual‚Äôs sense of being bad.¬†

Criterion 6: Individuals with BPD may display emotional instability that is due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days). The basic dysphoric mood of those with BPD is often disrupted by periods of anger, panic, or despair and is rarely relieved by periods of well-being or satisfaction. These episodes may reflect the individual‚Äôs extreme reactivity to interpersonal stresses.¬†

Criterion 7: Individuals with BPD may be troubled by chronic feelings of emptiness, which can co-occur with painful feelings of aloneness. Easily bored, they may frequently seek excitement or self-destructive impulses to avoid their feelings of emptiness.¬†

Criterion 8: Individuals with this disorder frequently express inappropriate, intense anger or have difficulty controlling their anger. They may display extreme sarcasm, enduring bitterness, or verbal outbursts. The anger is often elicited when a caregiver or lover is seen as neglectful, withholding, uncaring, or abandoning. Such expressions of anger are often followed by shame and guilt and contribute to the feeling they have of being bad.¬†

Criterion 9: During periods of extreme stress, transient paranoid ideation or dissociative symptoms (e.g., depersonalization) may occur, but these are generally of insufficient severity or duration to warrant an additional diagnosis. These episodes occur most frequently in response to a real or imagined abandonment. Symptoms tend to be transient, lasting minutes or hours. The real or perceived return of the caregiver‚Äôs nurturance may result in a remission of symptoms.¬†",aperyu-1,False,1715550685.0
1cqizqx,"Associated Features¬†

Individuals with BPD may have a pattern of undermining themselves at the moment a goal is about to be realized (e.g., dropping out of school just before graduation; regressing severely after a discussion of how well therapy is going; destroying a good relationship just when it is clear that the relationship could last). Some individuals develop psychotic-like symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, body-image distortions, ideas of reference, hypnagogic phenomena) during times of stress. Individuals with this disorder may feel more secure with transitional objects (i.e., a pet or inanimate possession) than in interpersonal relationships. Physical handicaps may result from self-inflicted abuse behaviors or failed suicide attempts. Recurrent job losses, interrupted education, and separation or divorce are common. Physical and sexual abuse, neglect, hostile conflict, and early parental loss are more common in the childhood histories of those with borderline personality disorder.

Prevalence¬†

The prevalence of BPD in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions data was 5.9%. A review of seven epidemiological studies (six in the United States) found a median prevalence of 2.7%. The prevalence of borderline personality disorder is about 6% in primary care settings, about 10% among individuals seen in outpatient mental health clinics, and about 20% among psychiatric inpatients. At any given point, 1 in 33 are experiencing BPD, and 1 in 16 will experience it at some point in their life.",aperyu-1,False,1715550708.0

1cqizqx,"Gunderson on the Element of Interpersonal Hypersensitivity:

‚ÄúPeople with BPD are born with a genetic disposition to be highly sensitive and reactive to their caretakers. They are more apt to attribute rejection or anger to parental behaviors than are other children. They have usually grown up feeling that they were unfairly treated and that they did not get the attention or care they needed. They resent this and, as young adults, they hope to establish a relationship with someone who can make up to them for what they feel is missing. The desired relationship is exclusive, setting in motion intense reactions to real or perceived slights, rejections, or separations. Predictably, both their unrealistic expectations and their intense reactions cause such relationships to fail. When this happens, people with BPD will feel rejected or abandoned, and they cannot resolve their anger about being treated unfairly and their fear that they are bad and deserve the rejection. Both conclusions can lead them to become self-destructive. Their anger about being mistreated, their shame about being bad, or their self-destructive behaviors can evoke guilt or protective feelings in others. Such guilt or rescuing responses from others validate the borderline person‚Äôs unrealistically negative perceptions of mistreatment and sustain their unrealistically high expectations of having their needs met. Thus, the cycle is apt to repeat itself.‚Äù",aperyu-1,False,1715550794.0

We - people with BPD- might be misunderstood a lot. But we know ourselves and our motives. Chances are, you have the heart of child. By that I mean pure.

1cqifvx,"You absolutely can get better; and I have been where you are. When I was first diagnosed (in my late 30s), it was both a relief and a terrifying experience. A relief because I finally had something to focus on understanding, and terrifying because *some* of what I read was very bleak. 

However, I can report that when I was diagnosed I was -- for all practical purposes -- a paralyzed shut-in who rarely left the bedroom. I had a history of serious suicide attempts (and very nearly succeeded on the last one), and had spent time in mental health facilities. But, after a couple of years in talk and DBT therapy and with the right medication regime I did get better -- slowly, but surely.

I now have more than six years of sobriety. I have very few BPD flare-ups. I am a full-time university student with a part-time job. My marriage has gotten stronger. My familial relationships have been repaired. I have friends. And folks who knew me ""back then"" say I'm a whole new person.

This is *not* to say that my life is always unicorns and rainbows and cotton candy. I still have triggers and the occasional flare-up, but they aren't nearly as severe as they used to be. My highs and lows aren't as extreme as they once were, and I'm kinder to myself when they happen.

I will always have BPD, but it no longer has control over my life. You absolutely can get better, because if I can do it, anyone can. I'm sending good vibes to you, [666420304](https://www.reddit.com/user/666420304/)! ü•∞",motionmasquerade,False,1715625028.0

Someone, please correct me if I'm using a term that's considered ""inappropriate.""
 I'm self depreciating enough as is, but I prefer the terms ""Episode"" and 
""Mood Shift.""

I use ""Episode"" when I'm feeling paranoia and psychosis - assigning the meaning  ""Of medical relevance"" and should be addressed with my care team. 

I use ""Mood Shift"" when I haven't had a clear trigger and just suddenly feel very sad for a few hours - days. I'm not paranoid or angry, just sad and low energy.

I routinely have predictable episodes and shifts during the latter half of my leutial phase and menstruation. Is your wife tracking this kind of thing?

When you are given a life-changing diagnosis, sometimes there's psychological help afterward or during if you think to ask.

It's intense, and if you allow yourself to trust the process and be as real as you can then you tap straight into some deep down shizz.  

I do it online with my therapist who I've never even met in real life.  I have never had a full session of EMDR where I haven't cried.  

I have had the beginnings of a session, and not really settled into it because of a distracted mind or something, in which case we just gently end it and move on to something else.  

But since the process touches stuff that is really deep and that stuff gets all over your brain it is extremely helpful to have a little ""outro"" session.  (Opposite of intro.) 

I really enjoy coming out of an EMDR session with a little guided visualization of loving, colorful, pure, loving light and energy beaming down into my head or this or that.  I find it very restorative.  

If you don't have a gentle tapering of that depth coming back to the real world then you can feel very off balance the rest of the day.

Surprisingly powerful way to get straight at your buried and hidden psychological wounds.  So it should be done with care.

Breaking up with my family (my parents and fone sibling, I still keep in touch with my younger sibling) was perhaps the best decision of my life. It was around 10 years ago, so I don't remember the whole process. It was difficult, I was going back and forth with the decision, I felt guilty when I was in the process. But in the end I did not see the point. And I never regreted this decision, ever. Sure, I do regret not having a family, I miss a family, but not THAT family, not my actual parents. I feel sorry for my family, but I don't feel I owe them anything and don't feel guilt anymore. It was liberating but also was and still is difficult.",SandersFarm,False,1715546876.0

I work from worse case scenario and ask myself if I am prepared to live with my decision if A, B or C happened. It's a constant internal crisis. I dunno recently I have been no longer feeling this internal crisis as much and starting to feel ready to stop being so passive. I feel you expresses your experience well being liberating and still difficult. Tbh I feel in general no human should ever feel they need to seek freedom from family and if sucks that families can be so shit you get pushed to this and then it's you that has to deal with the emotions for choosing to protect yourself. 

I decided to set a boundary and asked them to not contact me as I need a break from them. Sure I've been inundated with abusive text, threats and emotional manipulation but at least I finally took a stand.",FlyLive5486,True,1715547561.0
1cq3amp,"I congratulate you! Reading last sentences was very moving. You got this, you are on your way of making the decision which will be best for you. And it may be cutting them off completely but may also be setting boundaries and not giving in, while still being in touch with them, if that's what you need.

Yes, it is a difficult process. Now when I'm recalling it, it took me a year or two, which I consider short time for this kind of decision. Maybe I was just ready and disillusioned even before.

My mother tried to reach out to me not long ago. I met her, spoke with her and realized nothing changed. Since she lost me, her child, she had eight years to do her part of the job and think about her mistakes, but she did not.

I will elaborate on what is difficult for me now. First, not having a family sucks, as you said. I know that my actual family would not be the one I need and want to be in, but still there is this longing and need to... I don't know, pretend that we can be a family? During Christmas I imagine going back and having a Christmas dinner with them, if I could only somehow forgive them the neglect and abuse. But then I remember our Christmas dinners and I don't miss them anymore.

Second, social life, explaining people that I don't have a family. Luckily it doesn't happen often in my circles, people are respectful and do not assume that someone for example is religious and visits their family for Christmas. People around me udually just don't ask those questions, unless they are close. But I'm single and when I'm dating someone new usually there's a moment in which I have to reveal I cut ties with them. Which is often awkward. I should learn how to deliver this information better.

Although this one time when I delivered it pretty well (I think), a friend was shocked that I'm saying it in such a relaxed way. I was like: dude, do you want me to cry each time I say it? I live with this fact for ten years now, it's a big news for you but not a big deal for me anymore.

I also need to remember that for other people it is shocking, even though for me it's normal. I forget that people have normal lives :(",SandersFarm,False,1715548833.0
1cq3amp,"Thank you.. it feels good to put my foot down. 

Ah yes I can imagine how difficult explaining the no family situation to people or even potentially partners. As even though this has been our whole life a lot of people cannot fathom the need to disconnect from family. 

It's such a strange mirror but at least there are communities here where we can find others and see we are not as alone as we think.

I have to be careful who I share my light with, otherwise that light gets snuffed out and I go into a massive depressive mode. 

The best way to deal with this issue is to set some boundaries for yourself and others. If you notice someone consistently taking and never giving in return, cut them off as quickly as possible. 

Also, if you‚Äôre anything like me, you tend to be drawn to all the wrong people because that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre used to- what you‚Äôre comfortable with. I‚Äôm not saying hang out with people that make you uncomfortable- definitely don‚Äôt do that- but hang out with people that don‚Äôt give you that same adrenaline rush that the people who are bad for you do. It‚Äôs okay to have friends or even lovers that you‚Äôre not obsessed with. 

I‚Äôve never been obsessed or felt an extreme rush with my husband, but I‚Äôve always felt loved, safe and cared for, and that was enough to make me fall for him.  Sometimes we just need someone to level us out, not make our heart palpitate. 

Not to be confusing, but I‚Äôm not saying there weren‚Äôt the initial butterflies and excitement of meeting someone new with my husband, there was. But that fizzled out quickly because he felt safe. There were many times I thought maybe he wasn‚Äôt right for me because I just didn‚Äôt love him the way I loved those other people. The reality was that I just wasn‚Äôt used to receiving love.

1cq1mi1,"Firstly, understanding that smartphones are for their users and not users for smartphones is important. Only because I have a message or a notification waiting for me, it doesn't mean I have to immediately attend it. That would make me a slave to a device, even if there is a real person on the other end. Respecting boundaries and personal space is important. I used to rage over people leaving me on delivered/read and not replied, but then I realised I do it sometimes. Thing is, I was treating myself lightly because I had a good excuse not to reply immediately and then just forgot about it being busy with something else. Thing is I wouldn't think the same way about others, because I was waiting and that all I could see. That is a second important thing: you never know why someone is not replying. They are probably busy, maybe it skipped their mind and they'll get back to you later, when they have time to sit down and have a chat? Some people believe win quality over quantity. My ex would send me half-assed, short messages to teach me that lesson. I was nagging him for not replying as quickly and frequently as I did, so he started doing it. Considering he was really busy, he couldn't fully engage in texting throughout the day, but he gave me what I wanted. I regretted it later, as I started an argument that he isn't replying properly like he used to and it feels bad. He then said I can't possibly expect him to drop whatever he's doing every time I text him only because I do it. He is a person who fully engages in whatever he is doing and is present in the moment he is in, focusing on tasks and people he faces. That made me realize I am a bit pathetic for always dropping everything just to reply to people and placing them above everything. Fear of abandonment makes us clingy and controlling, we forget how to fully appreciate and engage with the moment we are currently in.

The thing is that our brains confuse ANY motion away from us with the life-threatening situation of being ""abandoned"" - literally left to die. Three-alarm fire!!!

The truth is more ordinary.
Adults can't be abandoned. When people leave our lives, we can still take care of ourselves. And there is no tribe we have to belong to, or else we perish... even though we evolved in a world where tribes were THAT important.

So what's up? We're hypersensitive because we were sensitized by our genes, trauma, and/or parenting.

What's our path forward? Looking for signs of safety. Downgrading from rage to quiet, step by step along this path.

RAGE - where we start

RAG - being ""on the rag"" (men, we probably do this more than women): irrational anger, with a little loss of control

RAAAAAAA! - a controlled growl; unhappiness over-dramatized.

Rrrrr.... - a grumble that acknowledges you're at least half responsible for the reaction you're having.

..... - A peaceful silence that says ""I'm going to be fine.""

Look at most of your rage moments. A few of them needed a response beyond silence. Most didn't. And yet we responded with RAGE. 

Step down. Just one step. Yes, the trigger is the same and the feeling is the same. But you can align with a different feeling and a different set of behaviors over time. I'm sure of it.

Having a sensitized trigger doesn't mean we have to be a machine gun every time there's conflict.

She's not going for that. It was for her depression over her divorce, and some issues shes raising over dealing with childhood trauma (which she's using as a reason for the divorce and giving my now senior parents hell, while she stays at home).

This doesn't even come close to talking about BPD, which I believe is the root cause. I didn't even see any of this and believed we did go through childhood trauma but I was emotionally unaware, thinking that I'm autistic or something, until I'm realising it's BPD (undiagnosed/my opinion).

1cpyq2a,"For professionals, Gunderson‚Äôs Handbook of Good Psychiatric Management of BPD recommends disclosing the diagnosis and emphasizing the element of interpersonal hypersensitivity. His example script: 

‚ÄúPeople with BPD are born with a genetic disposition to be highly sensitive and reactive to their caretakers. They are more apt to attribute rejection or anger to parental behaviors than are other children. They have usually grown up feeling that they were unfairly treated and that they did not get the attention or care they needed. They resent this and, as young adults, they hope to establish a relationship with someone who can make up to them for what they feel is missing. The desired relationship is exclusive, setting in motion intense reactions to real or perceived slights, rejections, or separations. Predictably, both their unrealistic expectations and their intense reactions cause such relationships to fail. When this happens, people with BPD will feel rejected or abandoned, and they cannot resolve their anger about being treated unfairly and their fear that they are bad and deserve the rejection. Both conclusions can lead them to become self-destructive. Their anger about being mistreated, their shame about being bad, or their self-destructive behaviors can evoke guilt or protective feelings in others. Such guilt or rescuing responses from others validate the borderline person‚Äôs unrealistically negative perceptions of mistreatment and sustain their unrealistically high expectations of having their needs met. Thus, the cycle is apt to repeat itself.‚Äù",aperyu-1,False,1715487552.0

1cpvnfp,"So the short answer is yes, it is very possible to have a healthy, stable relationship with BPD. Many, many people, in various parts of the BPD spectrum, have wonderful relationships and marriages!

However.

The long answer is that it takes a lot of work from both sides of the relationship to reach that stability. Both people need to be on the same page. The person with BPD needs to be able to take responsibility for their disorder-driven behaviors and should be seeking treatment. You can't force someone with BPD to ""get better"", they need to commit to learning and implement healthy coping skills. And with that said, while BPD is very treatable, it is a neurodivergent condition and can't be completely cured. The partner without BPD must be able to be patient, understanding, and willing to be the support that the person with BPD needs, including setting boundaries and learning how to communicate during episodes.

If you're going to pursue this relationship, I would recommend getting educated on BPD. I recommend Dr. Fox and Kati Morton on YouTube. Considering her admitted behaviors, you'll want to set boundaries ASAP. (Fox and Morton have videos to help you with that.)But always keep in mind that she is the only person who can truly help herself, and she will not change if she doesn't truly commit to doing so.

I think the strategy that has helped me the most in such times was -- What would you say to a loved one?
You must be familiar with it but just in case, I'll still remind you that we fail to be empathic towards ourselves because we either do not 'see' ourselves(mostly judge ourselves instead of 'observing'/'seeing') or we see ourselves in so many dimensions, so confusing, so intense that we think these things are negative (because we can only feel what we're feeling and nobody else can validate that other than ourselves)
But that's where we can think it this way-- if your close friend/someone you love would have done the same.. wouldn't you give them some space but hug them, comfort them(even if they might not reject it at first, obviously, they're in sorrow and probably afraid), to know what's happening to them? Give them some time but not abandon them in their time of grief? Wouldn't you be kind to them? Wouldn't you let them know that they deserve everything great! 
It's the same with us right? You must be going through *intense* emotions, they mean something.. they mean a lot and hence you decided to do something about it..
It's easy to fall into -- how will I face people, how will I be composed enough.. and many more things might be running in your mind..
The focus shift here is very important. You need to refocus on yourself other than answering to outer stigmas and opinions in your mind. Answer your inner questions and you do you(feel, reflect, intellectualize, rationalize, whatever helps, I'm not talking about drugs..they're always temperory fixes)

Hopefully with time it will be easier managed due to the medication and potentially talk therapy, but coming to terms with having it is a lot easier when episodes are less intense and few and far between.

1cprp5y,"Let's try a different approach, one that has helped me with my BPD:

If you are able to keep yourself alive without requiring the assistance of another person to feed, bathe, shelter, and clothe you...then you literally CANNOT be abandoned.

I'm not playing with words here. Your body knows ""abandonment = death"" because it is a universal truth for children today, and it WAS a universal truth for adults when/if left behind by their tribe. We could not survive alone.

It's instinct. You're supposed to feel what you feel and react how you react when actually being abandoned. 

The issue is that our trigger is so sensitized (by genetics, trauma, and/or parenting) that nearly everything seems like life-threatening abandonment. So we (over-) react accordingly.

If you're like me, focusing on desensitizing your trigger will help. 

You may fear being alone... that's because ""alone"" is the last step before death in our old tribal society. 

Now take a step back. Is that true anymore? No, it isn't. It just feels true all throughout your brain and body.

We're fighting that old instinct that everyone has. What we need to do is compare what we FEEL is happening (which is both extreme AND instinctual) with the reality of what is actually happening.

Describe the actual situation, not the chain we invent that connects the action to abandonment and death. Just the action: ""Ed didn't return my text for two days.""

Then ask, ""Is this my actual death?"" That's the question.

Of course it isn't. And all those thoughts like, ""But maybe it means Ed doesn't like me and and and..."" are symptoms, not reality. 

Ed didn't text and it will not cause your death. That's all you know for sure. Just sit with that. Let your system calm down. Let the reality surprise you. 

Obviously, this is far easier said than done, and good meds help make it a possibility for me (plus avoiding other drugs including alcohol and even caffeine) when I would struggle without those meds.

But this is the core truth: 
We feel like we're about to die when we are not. We have an instinctual trigger for that feeling that everyone else has, too. Ours is just hypersensitive. The more times we quickly calm ourselves after being triggered, the easier it will be to sometimes not get triggered at all.",FunChrisDogGuy,False,1715635174.0

1cprp5y,"You're so welcome. It helps me to write it out, too - and to remind myself to avoid alcohol (because last night I got a little triggered when I absolutely didn't need to).

You are strong. You are a whole person outside of this situation with your trigger, just as all of us are. You belong and you have much to offer - that will never change. Discovering your gifts and their value in this world is one of the biggest joys of recovery.

I hope you can start to notice the physical feelings when you're triggered. Get good at identifying them as they start. Then ask, ""Is this my actual death?"" and when you decide it isn't, take a deep breath, or two or three, and do your best to wait to respond until your body no longer feels triggered.

One of the things about instinctual behaviors is that they happen very quickly, bypassing much of our thought process. They FEEL right.

On the one hand, that's why we're a thriving species and not just a favorite snack tigers used to enjoy before we went extinct.

On the other hand, that makes it doubly hard to hit the brakes before we speak.

The root of all of this is our natural fear of death. As a group, when we get triggered we tend to go to ""The Five F's of Fear"" - fight, flight, freeze, fawn, or (for the hypersexual among us) f*ck.

Our goal is to be able to disrupt those F's and get to a state of mind marked by V - we're valuable, vulnerable, and voicing only the facts. 

That's our victory, when we can stop the whole rage with, ""Arrgh, I feel afraid."" It's every V in one simple statement.

Again - all of this is easier said than done, and it helps to have appropriate therapy and any necessary medication.

1cpfckt,"It entirely depends what you mean by ""mood swings"". It could be anything. What's the context?

If your ""mood swing"" results in being unpleasant, lashing out on him and arguing with him which makes him scared then you need some self reflection. It's you.

If you're just moody and not behaving the way you usually would but aren't doing anything bad to him then it's him who needs to sit down and think why he's triggered by nothing and work on it.

In case it's the latter you can't go around life pretending it's all sunshine and rainbow 24/7 just so he doesn't feel bad. Because it's not. Sometimes you're going to be sad and that's okay. It's a normal part of life and he should be accepting of that.

If he can panic and feel sad, he should recognise that other people too sometimes panic and are sad. He can't behave selectively where it's okay for him to feel that way but not you. It's contradictory.

But most importantly, ask him which one of these two it is. Are you unpleasant to be around or is it all in his head?

And let him be honest and accept the answer no matter what it is if you actually want to solve this. You don't want him to sugarcoat problems that you're trying to solve just so he doesn't hurt your feelings. Sometimes the truth is shit to hear and you need to hear it.",PoxBC,False,1715433789.0
1cpfckt,"Thank you for this comment. 

I do lash out sometimes, but very rarely and we always talk about it after. 

He said, it's hard for him to deal with my mood swings after one occasion that went the following: he said something that triggered a feeling in me. I went quiet. I tried to hide it, but my whole body language was screaming that I feel unwell and engaging in the conversation got really hard. He asked what's wrong, to which I said, my head is being weird. I went for a short walk around the neighborhood to escape the feeling, but it didn't help and I was still tense when I returned. 

He told me, whenever I get like this, he feels he did something wrong, feels lost and scared that I could lash out any moment (which has happened a couple of times). He said, my mood changes so quickly and it's so out of the blue for him.

I know it can be emotionally draining to be around someone who can get moody so easily. I always struggle with pulling myself out of the emotion and tend to spiral. I know I can be very intense, even if I don't lash out. 

I do feel it's something he needs to work on, just like I work on my stuff. I just wish I could make this all a little easier on him.",Jutora97,True,1715494985.0
1cpfckt,"Ahh.... yeah. Okay this is gonna be longer but I hope you get something out of it once you read it.

From personal experience, if he said something you percieved as something bad (trigger) it's best to double check what he **actually** meant by what he has said/done. Right then and there. The longer you wait to ask questions the worse your overthinking gets because you're giving it time to build up. You don't want it to build up. You musn't. If you let it then this happens.  
  
When you're both in this headspace the easiest thing to accomplish is to cause an argument over the dumbest things possible. Over time those arguments probably have nothing to do with the original problem you've had with him. Because that first ""problem"" just made 10 more extra problems. You end up creating something out of nothing. Because 99% of time nothing is actually happening.

The best approach that goes a long way is realizing; *What you think others think of you is actually what* ***you*** *think of you and not them.* 

Now pause and really process that. And you'll realize it's true for absolutely everything. Everyone is projecting themselves, their experiences and things they care about onto others. In any contex. His panic, for example, is a projection of his past experiences onto you. You do it too.  
  
It's not daily that you run into people who give a shit about you let alone give it time to think bad of you and yet if they do - they have a problem with themselves. Notice how the problem you have with him actually starts in you? And the problem he has with you starts within him. You're both projecting onto one another.  Except he's dating you because he likes/loves you so it doesn't make sense to assume he thinks badly of you. If he did, he wouldn't date you. And the same goes for you. Funny how that works, right?

Neither of you have control over how the other one will understand the world around them, but you have control over how **you** behave and how you can **help** the other understand you.

Once you really drill this into your head, these kind of interactions stop being as confusing and as hurtful . So, he can't read your mind to understand you therefore it is up to you to take control and help him understand you. The only one you have control over is you. The only way you'll do that is by communicating it. Aka the opposite of running away into your bubble for hours on end.

Now the second part of this ""solution"" is how you're going to communicate it and that's the part that's the easiest to fuck up yet it's the most crucial one.

How you communicate matters a lot. When we're hurt by or angry at someone the easiest thing to do is either run away or say the nastiest things possible to really prove your point how horrible they were and how much they hurt us, how much we hate it and blabla. But when you pause and think about it... Nobody in the world actually benefited long term out of anger and nobody in the world benefited out of being agressive towards one another. The only thing that ever resulted in was chaos and pain.

If you ever played video games you can think of it like that. Your relationship is teamwork, you're on the same team. Meaning your partner is your teammate. Naturally, you need to talk in a way in which you both benefit out of it and get to the victory. When you have a problem you need to work on that progrem together, not against each other. It's not battle royale or Hunger Games.

If your victory condition is proving a point about how much he hurt you, it's not teamwork. It goes into battle royale where you want to crush him and win on your own. But again, relationship is teamwork and doesn't and cannot work that way. This means that both of you need to shut down your ego. Both of you need to calm down and fight the problem itself. Sometimes that problem is just within us and doesn't actually involve our partner despite seeming like it does. Sometimes you'll have to sit down with yourself and work things out on your own. With BPD, it's more often than not sitting down with none other than yourself. Rarely is your partner actually a part of the problem you have.

If you two genuinely love each other you'll both need to realize these things and start working together. Because your current problem is the ""battle royale"" and projection of your own inner nonsense onto one another. And this isn't something that will happen over night because it won't.

A part of loving someone is realizing they're really not different from us. The same way they hurt us is the same way we can hurt them if we let it happen. So it's important to have empathy in that sense and to remember to go easy on our SO. But for those of us with BPD it's particularly hard because we tend to villainize them making it harder to actually sympathise. It takes effort to see through this and to work on it.

Both of you will literally have to train your brain to not jump to worst possible conclusions and when you've spent most of your life doing exactly that - it's going to be hard and it's going to take time. But hard doesn't mean it's impossible and time doesn't mean forever.

Every time you find yourself thinking negatively just remember that it's what you think and nothing more. You have control over how you're going to think about things and for how long. Saying you don't have control over it is also just an opinion you chose to have. That opinion can change if you want it to change. Because it's just that...

I frequently get asked ""are you from Houston, Boston, or whatever city"". I used to say ""I am a sports fan and carry on small talk"". Now I just say ""no I am from Ohio"" and I disengage from the conversation/small talk. I know they are being polite but I do not owe anyone an explanation and I do things for my own purpose/style/look. I value privacy and explaining myself in public goes against that.

Other times I will just walk past familiar people like they don't even exist because maybe they wronged me or showed an ounce of disrespect. Their is no salvation or forgiveness because I do not trust you.

I am irritated all of the time. Sometimes I'm trying so hard to contain those feelings that I come off as cold and irritated WITH the person. But I'm more half dissociated, and just trying it cope with the feelings in ways that aren't explosive. Sometimes I am angry with that person, but I know they don't deserve it, and I fail at completely covering that up. But it's never usually an intention to be passive aggressive even though that's how it presents. That's just where I'm at sometimes in my ability to cope. I do this far far far less often that I used to.

Idk if thats your husband's experience. But maybe he is just fighting his splitting. And when he's back to normal, the episode may have passed. I would suggest that when he's not in an episode, trying to have a very gentle talk about things. Explain that behavior, and don't focus on how it makes you feel (yet), but ask him for his perspective. Then ask if there's any thing you can do to help. Maybe he just needs you to understand, maybe space helps, maybe something helps. Then, after you've aknowledged his feelings and needs, you can bring up how it makes you feel, how it worries you, and if you need compromise, you can both try to find it there. Very important to have this when he is feeling well. But hopefully his perspective will help you both to find a way forward.

Sorry you‚Äôre going through this, it‚Äôs terribly damaging ü´Çüíú

They might be going avoidant (if they‚Äôre disorganised attached) and pushing you away because you felt too close, and that triggers their threat response because people are unsafe and scary.

Alternatively they might have experienced a real or perceived betrayal/slight that pissed them off, but not so much as to trigger external rage, regardless you no longer seem safe to them.

From my experience, a real or perceived betrayal was inevitable anyway, actually I am glad they‚Äôve done it sometimes, because it means we can finally stop pretending. So I‚Äôm not angry, instead I am relieved. The other person continuing to ‚Äòpretend‚Äô (for example kissing you goodbye) is thus met with disdain and or ire.

Getting apologies - Yes I can see how pwBPD can learn to apologize.

pwBipolar, seem to have a tougher time apologizing or having guilt. There is shame and a lot of shame‚Ä¶. The shame is rationalized with defense mechanisms, rewriting the narrative in their head as to why the person did what they did‚Ä¶ it felt right in the moment. But looking back it was not right. 

Some will blaming others as a rationale for it too, or create reasons to blame them. (Like accusing *their partner* for cheating, when they aren‚Äôt‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs making up an excuse for them to cheat.)

The subreddit for Anhedonia is quite small, but on a google search I see a lot of posts regarding the inability to feel happiness in the depression subreddit. I think getting the perspective from different groups might give you the most insight for you.  


I can't say I've ***never*** felt joy, but I can say that I haven't felt much pleasure in anything in a very, very, very long time. I've come to accept that it's how I'm wired, and that neutral is my peace. I try not to compare myself too much‚Äîof course I wish I could feel true joy, but I'm not wired that way. So while I do envy others, I also try not to get myself stuck in that envy. If I compare myself to the whole of everyone else, I will always be lacking. So I've learned to compare myself to myself. If my best is neutral, then neutral days are good days, not bad days, etc. I try not to think about whether or not I am ""supposed"" to be here. I am here. That's that. Everyone is ""just here"". Our purpose is something everyone has to find themselves. I personally haven't found what I want that answer to be just yet, but I don't a rush. I am here today, and I'll be here tomorrow, and here next year. I have my whole life to give myself a purpose if I need one.

Remember that goals in therapy don't have to be ""get happy"". My goals in therapy are 1. Have a safe place to vent my frustrations and learn how to better cope with anger. 2. Learn more about how my BPD and my Autism influence each other, and 3. Work on self confidence.

1covzn8,"Lowkey I'm a bit envious of that tbh, the ability to have those serotonin boots. Even meds have not worked for me. It's really hard to explain when there is absolutely nothing bringing joy. For instance, my entire life all I wanted was to become a parent. My previous therapist basically gave me the ok to have a child (since one of my worries was, am I going to be a good parent even with BPD etc). But even after accomplishing the literal only thing I wanted out of life, I felt nothing positive. I felt anxiety, I felt regret (I regret forcing an innocent child into this world, I feel horrible about it every day), loneliness, but mostly anxiety.  I love my child, but I can't say I feel joy. I never felt joy about anything. I have felt great sadness, anticipation, anger, fear, love (LOTS of love), relief. Relief is the closest thing to happiness I have felt.

People on here or the meme subreddit often talk as if there is a ""before"" BPD that they miss, and the way therapy was sold to me my entire life was that I was gonna learn to get back to simpler times. Simpler brain processes. Simpler everything that will make me find joy and love in the sun, flowers, the feel of grass under my feet or whatever. And I have never had that before. My first memory was me staring at a green wall at the age of <2, then my second memory is me wanting to not have been born when I was \~4 lol. My entire life I felt like I wasn't supposed to be here, and this lifelong unease and lack of joy is so so hard to explain.",yikkoe,True,1715371768.0
1covzn8,"Thank you so much for your comment! And I totally agree with you. I think however people with depression I've spoken to don't \*never\* feel joy. They don't anymore, but most have felt it as some point, and many seek it again. I have gotten in many conflicts with people about that, people who truly genuinely don't believe that it's possible to have never felt joy. I get accused of not trying hard enough, being stubborn etc lol. The only subreddit and also neurotype that gets it, are people who are Schizoid. They are, at most, neutral. But they also feel this strange ""I'm not supposed to be here"" feeling. By the way, this feeling isn't about purpose. It's genuinely about feeling like you are not supposed to be on Earth. Kind of like, that cigarette shaped object that is not from our solar system, why is it here? It's not supposed to be. Or, it would be very absurd to find a piece of meteorite in my cheeseburger. Just this absurd ""what the hell is this doing here?"" type feeling, but about our own existence. I don't think human existence needs purpose to be fulfilling, but I am not supposed to experience human existence at all. And I felt this way since I was about 4! I so vividly remember thinking that during the ""putting babies in bellies"" process, there was a mistake. They grabbed me when I was supposed to be an angel. You know, in my 4 year old logic lol. I was not supposed to be born, and that grew into suicidal thoughts I guess haha. 

  
It's such, such a difficult thing to fully explain, and I think that's why I struggle with therapy. 11 years of therapy can be summed into therapists believing that I need to learn to find joy, and I need to learn emotional regulation, and eeeeverything is gonna be okay. But with age I'm learning, eh I'm meant to be neutral at best. Joy can't happen within me. I can't wait to find that peace for real, of being okay with neutrality. Because you are right, I envy people too much. I think it's mostly because my dullness keeps people away, and I'm extremely lonely. I want human connection but I am not built for that it seems, so I'll alway feel like I'm lacking something. I joined a group on Facebook for people living very neutral, ""boring"" lives but they are okay with it. I have hopes I will achieve that one day, and I am thankful to have a therapist who is open to that goal.

I will say, partaking in group therapy has helped me a lot. Learn how to set boundaries within yourself and with others.

1coa0u9,"They do  but this happens with every personality disorder. Take NPD for example, narcissism has become such a buzz word and everyone knows a ton of narcissists. Every person has narcissistic traits and displays them at times but true NPD only is prevalent in 0.5% of the population, yet disagreements, discipline, different opinions, fights and hurt feelings are   projecting, gaslighting or manipulation. People aren‚Äôt in pain or suffering from emotional neglect by an abuser but it becomes a ‚Äúnarcissistic abuser‚Äù. The problem is when your in pain and you‚Äôve been abused it feels empowering and liberating to a have a label for what you experienced but the majority of the time it‚Äôs wrong. This is a problem for two reasons: people start to see narcissists everywhere (people that take to many selfies, a partner that gets angry, a boss that gives constructive criticism a as part of their job etc). It also invalidates people that have truly experienced narcissistic abuse. People that have experienced this type of abuse aren‚Äôt angry or say they stood up for themselves, they are so broken and traumatized, they don‚Äôt know who they are, how to speak up, confused, feel like they are going crazy etc. They are a shell of who they used to be. The narcissist required so much attention and all they did was please them and never speak up or do anything to upset them. Most people don‚Äôt know it was narcissistic abuse and these are educated people, even psychiatrists themselves. It‚Äôs a myth that because people have more information available now or are more educated that they just identify the traits. They assign behaviors to a trait they learned. Borderline personality disorder is stigmatized by people and mental health professionals. However it is also stigmatized by people with the disorder itself and here is why: BPD is caused by a combination of hereditary genes, brain structure and environment (trauma), however you do not need to have experienced trauma to be diagnosed. BPD is the most painful mental illness there is and when you‚Äôve been abused and you live in pain, just like any abuse victim, it feels validating and empowering to know that this was caused by your abuser (s). Abuse is never the victims fault, they didn‚Äôt deserve it and it impacts them tremendously. I understand this and was abused myself. The problem is that people with BPD will not acknowledge or often get very angry and won‚Äôt accept that genes and brain structure (I know trauma can change the brain but here I‚Äôm talking about the brain you‚Äôre born with) are part of the equation. The majority of those diagnosed experienced trauma, that is true, however, trauma all by itself does not cause BPD. Trauma all by itself causes PTSD or CPTSD, but trauma is not a requirement to be diagnosed with BPD. People with BPD will state that ‚Äúmy trauma caused my BPD‚Äù or partners will say, ‚Äúmy girlfriend has BPD because of trauma‚Äù. This also perpetuates stigma. You were abused, you didn‚Äôt deserve it, it hurt you and it‚Äôs affected your life in horrible ways (this is all accurate), however, the majority of people physically, sexually, verbally abused or emotionally neglected do not develop BPD (the prevalence is 2-5% of the population). Non biased scientific studies have shown that two people that were abused only developed BPD if the genes/brain structures were present and twin studies show that only the twin with the genes developed BPD when brought up neglected. This creates the stigma that BPD is only the result of trauma and that‚Äôs not correct. Regardless of trauma you may still have developed BPD no matter what. The reason this is so important is that it changes the trajectory of getting better (this happens with people who say they were abused versus narcissistic abuse as well). The overwhelming and intense angry emotions you have towards the abuser(s) keep people stuck and they ruminate on it versus putting the same mental energy into healing. Now think about being in a relationship and feeling like no one understands that you do things because of trauma you experienced but other people with trauma do not have BPD, you‚Äôre reinforcing BPD stigmas. There are siblings in families that experienced CSA by a caregiver but only one develops BPD, there are going to be conflicts in their relationship in regard to the trauma both experienced. Couples that are romantically involved can both grow up with the exact same abuse but most of the conflict in the relationship is over different feelings and how trauma is blamed for hurtful behavior. My point is if you solely believe you feel things so intensely based on your trauma and those without BPD know that trauma isn‚Äôt the only factor or have trauma themselves and don‚Äôt feel the same way as you, it creates the stigma (which pwBPD say) that people with borderline personality disorder make excuses for their behavior or blame everything on their trauma.

From ICD-11:
> Mood Episodes are not independently diagnosable entities, and therefore do not have their own diagnostic codes. Rather, Mood Episodes are the components of Bipolar or Related Disorders and Depressive Disorders.

And:
> Mood Disorders refers to a superordinate grouping of Depressive Disorders and Bipolar Disorders. Mood disorders are defined according to particular types of Mood Episodes and their pattern over time. The primary types of Mood Episodes are: Depressive Episode, Manic Episode, Mixed Episode, Hypomanic Episode

For me personally, my parents were loving, and provided all they could. I considered them good parents that did the best they could with what they had.

My father was an alcoholic who may or may not have had BPD or NPD himself. The raging when drunk was definitely terrible, so I won't do into that. Where they failed, to me, is that they were emotionally unavailable. My parents never really played with me. They never got involved in my interests. They never asked about my feelings. When I was upset, it was ""just get over it"". When I was happy, it was ""that's great go play"". I was such a good kid behaviorally and ""gifted"" in school. But my parents thought that was the bare minimum. I can't remember a lot of times I was praised. I can't remember times when my parents showed care that I was picked on in school. My brother was favored over me. 

I'm no longer on speaking terms with my father, and I'm made amends with my mom. But a lifetime of shutting me down and dismissing both my troubles and my joys have left me very emotionally distant.

1co2oc0,"My parents caused my BPD. Lots of trauma growing up. What I wish they had done was protect me. From themselves, from the world, from people they brought into our home. They both were really good about saying they loved us, and even showing that love in a lot of ways. But alcoholism and their own trauma was too much for them to overcome. 
In an effort to break that cycle I think I went too far the other way. Worried about every tear and upset my oldest especially had. I fixed everything for her and tried to stop any hurt I could. And of course that‚Äôs not the way either. I may have finally figured it out with my youngest. 
So as someone with BPD that‚Äôs newly diagnosed what I can tell you is what I need now. I need to know I won‚Äôt be abandoned. I need to know that I matter. I need to know that I have value and a purpose. I need to feel like I‚Äôm at the top of at least one person‚Äôs list. That wasn‚Äôt the case when I was a child. I try to make sure my children (adults now) know that no matter what they are #1 in my life and will always have a home with me. Don‚Äôt try to dissect her feelings. Praise her often.

And at the same time, don‚Äôt try to dissect her feelings and behavior. If she is talking to you about something don‚Äôt try to fix it, just sympathize with her and let her know her feelings are heard. 

I think the fact that you‚Äôre here looking for help says enough about what kind of mom you are. Just keep being that mom. And remember that even though she does have BPD, she‚Äôs still a teenager and teenagers make dumb decisions and act like we know nothing all the time. Even the best behaved ones.

Yes, over the years (I'm 28 now) I have repeatedly reduced contact but never broken it off. As soon as she took the initiative, I was there again, replied, suggested meeting up... But her fear ultimately paralyzed her so much that she didn't really say anything anymore. No matter what I did, I couldn't take away her fear. So we lost our relationship because there was no chance to work on it in an adult way and grow out of the destructive structures.

Learn together, take a close look at your relationship dynamics and try to make them healthier with the knowledge from the diagnose. Don't be afraid to make mistakes.

I wish they took the time to learn about this disorder and see me as a person, not a ticking time bomb. 

I wish they told me that I am capable of living with BPD and that it‚Äôs a life worth living. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd make it to 30. 

My therapist said something significant - when my past trauma occurred, I stopped maturing emotionally. Emotionally, I was a 16 year old girl trapped in a 30 year old body. It wasn‚Äôt until I acknowledged this that I started to be able to do work on myself and learning how to regulate my emotions, recognize my triggers, communicate my needs, and respond appropriately instead of splitting or spiraling. 

For me, my triggers are unsolicited and harsh criticism, feeling like I‚Äôm being abandoned, and betrayal. 

My first emotion is hurt but it is quickly followed by a secondary emotion which is anxiety. To numb the intense anxiety I feel, I turn to rage. When I split, I am unable to tell friend from foe and will verbally and sometimes physically attack the perpetrator. It‚Äôs not until my emotions recede that I am able to see the damage I‚Äôve done. Then I feel a severe level of self-hatred mixed with guilt, shame, and fear of being abandoned. 

But there‚Äôs hope - I‚Äôve found my med cocktail and am living a fruitful and rich life. I have learned techniques for when I feel myself get triggered and can remove myself from the situation instead of splitting. I spend 98% of my time being a loving person.

1co2oc0,"Hi, glad you're trying to be there for her. thing is, she's almost an adult and at this point you can't treat her like a kid only because she hasn't had 18th birthday just yet.

We can't really help you too well because not everyone with BPD is the same. We share some traits but we have whole personalities behind those shared traits. Many people seem to see us only as BPD and nothing else. Many of us strongly identify with the diagnosis and see themselves as nothing than BPD, it defines them. Try to reassure your daughter she's more than that and it's only a small part of who she is and she can learn to control it. Perhaps get online DBT therapy if you can't have it in person, that's what I did. You can pick from people from all around the world as long as you have a steady internet connection.

You seem like a loving and caring parent. You did what you could and thought is best, never think otherwise.

As for some tips, here are things that my parents should've heard:

Speak to her with patience. Don't take anything she says personally, if anything try to acknowledge she hurt your feelings in a constructive way ('Girl, I love you and that's why I want you to know that you hurt my feelings with xyz.' you can also try asking why she behaved in that way or said whatever she did if you feel it's right). Don't let emotions and her shitty behaviours make you wnat to get the better of her. Even if she deserves a big time slap in her face one day, you must be a better, bigger person. Sometimes it's going to be better to just leave her alone for some time, she will come back when the time is rough if you've been patient and forgiving with her.

And treat her like an adult. I know that in your head and heart she's still your little baby, but she doesn't feel like one. She's an adult and always think about how would you speak to your friend and apply that to your daughter. Don't speak down on her, she may feel invalidated and intimidated and your relationship may suffer.

It's hard and it will be, mainly for her. Don't judge, don't tell her what to do. Try to guide her and ask right questions that would help her to figure out what to do and to understand and cope with her feelings. There is a lot of supporting material online about that.

My mother (who is BPD diagnosed but we do not know if she had it during my childhood) did her best to meet the cost of bills, shelter, and food. Sometimes she'd work two full time jobs to ensure we had money. She had two partners over the course of my childhood who turned out to be very and *very* very abusive. 

A lot of trauma occured largely outside her hands and so I cannot blame her for anything. Moreover, had she known about my disorders then, it's highly likely she wouldn't have been able to do any more so, in that regard, I think I can say I'm fortunate that she did not contribute actively to my issues. Our overall situation, however, was egregiously unfortunate. 

For your daughter, I'm not sure what you can do besides your very best to inform yourself on BPD, seek professional help, maintain patience and compassion, maintain a strong channel of communication, etc. With my diagnosed friends, I provide weekly BPD flashcards for them to practice but it only works if they commit to applying the skills. We can only do so much; the rest falls onto the other person and if they're able to digest, apply, and utilize these skills *and* if the skills and/or medications help at all to change them for the better.

More than anything, I appreciate the reassurance that everyone is their own person. So many discussions have been had.

I have come to terms with my parents' own traumas. My mother was the youngest of 5, in a VERY poor household. I mean like: house made of mud, no shoes to school, 7 people in a space no bigger than 1bedroom/1bathroom apartment, milk and bread for meals type of poor. Her parents were kind, but worked nonstop, and her father was in and out of the mental hospital. While she was close to her family, perhaps the emotional unavailability of her own parents made her spoil her youngest (not me lol). She also had a husband that cruel bastard. My father grew up the oldest, and only male, of 4, and was raised by an physically abusive stepdad and a strict mother. 

They didn't want children (as my father loooooved to remind me of. i had to be grateful for everything because i was 'lucky' to be here), and my mom was told that she could not have children. They weren't necessarily prepared, but tried their best. I was a tomboy and my brother was very feminine‚Äîunfortunately, boyish girls are much more 'acceptable' in conservative cultures‚Äîso I think my mom was trying to protect my brother a lot because she perceived that my dad didn't like my brother. But even my brother admits that he noticed how he was the favorite.

I really think my parents did their best. But they didn't come from comfortable upbringings themselves, and it definitely shows. I think they both did better than their parents did them. I think they know this and they have a lot of guilt over it. So I forgive them in that way. 

 It took me until my 30s to realize and accept that I was emotionally neglected. And unfortunately, a lot of that has stuck with me. While I've forgiven my parents, I've not forgotten, and their consequence is that they will never really ever get to know me in an emotionally intimate way.",princefruit,False,1715363833.0

1cnt9x9,"Hi, i hope you're doing well. Here are my two cents on what i've learned since remission. No matter what you think of yourself at the end of the day we are social animals. Yes, there are odd people and mean people. However, everything that we want, we get from people. It would be impossible to live alone because our brains are not wired for that. This downside is made up by the generations upon generations of invention and compassion that we get to have the¬†results of today.

I don't know what this means for you. For me, i have gone from living in a fantasy world to living for people and with people to make things slightly more fun and better. Maybe not so successfully but i try any chance i have.

Another thing also, the body is a biological entity. We are not like a computer, our function depends on many chemical interactions and structures. So it is especially important to tend to the body with compassion. Eat well, exercise and get sun every day, connect with people, and find the time to practice breathing well. when i feel horrible its is usually because i feel horrible, ie. My space is a mess and the food i eat causes vitamin deficiency.

Now that I can connect the dots and understand my triggers, things feel less intense.

It isn‚Äôt always easy and it‚Äôs a lot of hard work. I chose to go on the natural path and avoid medication, only because I prefer to rely on myself rather than a pill that I may not be able to afford someday for any reason. 

I lead a much more peaceful life, I never thought would be possible. I have better quality relationships now because my impulses are more controlled.

I still have my down days when I get triggered - it‚Äôs a journey - but I learned how to self soothe in a healthier way so I‚Äôm out of the funk faster now. 

It‚Äôs not easy but it‚Äôs possible. I feel like I‚Äôm awake for the first time, and I‚Äôm present. Before therapy I was just surviving.

Would she agree to couples counselling? This might be a way to discuss your concerns with her in a structured, safe place and could help her to hear what you're saying without feeling attacked. 

I will also say, and this is hard for me as someone with BPD to say, but you also have to think about yourself.. if this is a neverending battle and its affecting you, you need to think whether staying together is the right thing for you both.

Twilight is literally written in a way that romanticises toxic BPD relationships, FP obsession and bad behaviour in general. It's portraying it as peak romance. And when you know it's not it just makes the movies and the whole story feel so tragic and depressing.

Bella throughout the whole story has no hobbies or interests other than Edward. Her life is all about him even when he's gone and because of that she also nukes her relationship with everyone else and goes antisocial. She treats her own father like dirt even when he doesn't deserve it and is just trying his best to make things right. I don't understand what the deal with that was to begin with. Nowhere in the story was there any reason for him to get that kind of treatment from her. It's insanely tragic.

I didn't understand why Robert hated the role and the movies so much when I was a teen. Now 15 years later I can see why. The criticism is well deserved. Teenage girls were sucking this story up and treated it as an example of an amazing relationship and deep love when it is faaaar from that.

1cn7jts,"I can understand how frustrating that must be - I am really sorry both you and your mom have to deal with that situation. 

Those with BPD are like toddlers - overly emotional / stubborn. As everyone else has been suggesting the best thing to do would be to ride out the storm and see if her mood eventually changes. The best thing I think you and your mom can do is set boundaries and enforce them, kind of like you do with kids. If she is not cleaning up in the house / not working or paying for bills, there needs to be consequences. What it boils down to is that there needs to be repercussions or she needs to accept treatment. I don't think this is laziness as much as your sister does not have any ability to self-regulate hence all she wants to do is die because she is feeling too much pain. 

BPD boils down to these really intense emotions that people have difficulty self-soothing in a non-destructive way. Whereas a normal angry person may take a walk a person with BPD may explode with intense rage. It's worth repeating: you and your mom need to set boundaries and MOST IMPORTANTLY, both of you have to remain neutral. 

As unfair as this is going to sound - she will feed off your energy, you're pissed off and angry she's going to swing right back ten times harder.

While hypersexuality and self sabotage can be found in BPD, I do want to point out that cheating is never okay, and that cheating is not really a symptom of BPD. There is currently no creditable correlation in BPD and cheating. I am also a bit confused as to why you spouse decided to cheat, but I don't know if anyone here could provide that answer.

*Some* flavors of BPD come with high risk impulsive desires. However, seeing that this was an ongoing affair, to me this sounds like this wasn't impulsive but that your spouse chose to be unfaithful because he doesn't respect you more than his desires, not because he has BPD.

You know him better than we do. But unfortunately I think trying to think of this as self sabotage is an attempt to cope by saying that this was something his disorder was controlling, and not him. You can't rationalize it, because it's not rational.

1cn4sli,"You're not wrong about skewed processes. BPD is a disorder that literally changes how the brain functions. The way he processes emotions are not the same on a biological level. That said, there are limitations to that. Impusiveness and hypersexuality might give someone the urge to cheat, but it doesn't control the act of cheating, nor does it magically strip logic and reason from someone. I would say that the urge to cheat could be led by his BPD. Planning and acting on that urge in not just a one night affair (which is also not forgivable) goes well beyond a BPD urge. That is a calculated, conscious decision to be unfaithful for a prolonged period.

The drinking certainly doesn't help.

Your soon-to-be-ex is responsible for his behavior and needs to get help to curb his addictions and get to the root of his own problems. Unfortunately, the 'why' can sometimes be as simple as 'that person has no love or loyalty for themselves and others'. Unsatisfying, I know. It fucking sucks.

What I‚Äôve realized is you can‚Äôt make her change and you can‚Äôt force love onto her when she isn‚Äôt in a place to accept it. A lot of people with BPD grew up with trauma in there lives so when they are given a relationship that is stable and healthy it can be foreign and scary to them, so much so that they may push you away even if you are something positive in their life.

If you want to remain friends, as I did the first time we were broken up, you may feel confused at times because there will be quite a bit of push and pull between you two.

1cmwcyk,"2 years into our relationship, she started strongly suggesting marriage. When I was firm about saying no unless she got into therapy, she did (with the condition that I do so myself, which I was fine with). 6 months there were definitely changes and improvements in the severity of the outbursts and she was fixated on marriage. 

Went through another mini honeymoon during that phase. Once everything was set & done, the demeanor and tone started to change again. There were frequent comparisons to past marriage and experiences,  a lot of insecurity and fears that would be result in outbursts all the time, including around my family. My mom who up until then she adored, and found to be the kindest woman, suddenly became the object of her ire. 

So a lot of old patterns started coming up, but this time she insisted this was all my doing and my family's doing and it had nothing to do with her past. 

Btw - up until this point, any and all attempts at putting up boundaries, trying to carve out some semblance of a life for myself was incredibly difficult because of her abandonment issues. Every time I would try to do anything that didn't involve her, play a sport, talk to my family etc, would become points of escalation about how I don't prioritize her, her needs, her well being. If I tried to leave, I would be stopped at all costs, with begging, crying, threat of self harm. The cost of actually walking away which I've done will result in an episode that lasts days where she remains stuck to the bed, crying, repeating the same things about how I've hurt her. (Also, at this point, she had stopped therapy, and insisted she had done the healing, but it was me that doing this to her). 

Fast forward to now, after some brutal time with family over the winter, I said we're going to get into therapy or it's over. So we've been in couples therapy for a few weeks now. There were a couple of moments where she almost opened up about the trauma and thoughts she faces, and they play out in our relationship. But she stopped short. And the next day back with me, it's almost like whatever happened in therapy didn't happen. The same thing about how I'm always responsible for what she's going through plays out. 

So right now, going to therapy in the hope what's happening is acknowledged, that there's a path forward for both. 

Biggest pain I have, I don't know which outcome ends up in us having any semblance of a normal life. On top of all this, recently she's fixated on kids and becoming a mom. Has anyone here been through this journey, actually learnt to lead a life that they feel fulfilled with?

I‚Äôm not perfect and I still have my moments, but now I am able to recognize when I‚Äôm the problem and take accountability, regulate my emotions better and think about if my emotions are rooted in reality or just an automatic response. I‚Äôm good at accepting boundaries but I still have trouble enforcing my own. I still go to recreational therapy to help keep me on track. I found that if I‚Äôm not in any type of therapy it‚Äôs easier for me to fall back into old patterns.

My mother sounds a lot like your wife. The majority of my family will not speak to my mother. I told her if she wants a relationship with me she has to get real help.

It sounds like he's not going very well atm. Sometimes people with bpd push people away because they dont feel they deserve to be loved or because they want to be reassured they are loved (when you push someone away theyll often express things like ""no i dont want to leave, i care about you!"" which is an expression of care the person may be wanting). I always used to tell my ex ""you should find someone else"" because I thought I was terrible, I was scared of him leaving (so wanted to pre-empt it) and saying that lead to reassurance (subconsciously encouraging me to say it when I wanted reassurance). 

Christmas comes with a LOT of pressure - pressure to be happy, money pressure, pressure to see family (and enjoy it). This can be really hard for someone with mental illness and a poor support network (especially if family is shitty. You see everyone being happy but feel alone and like a failure for feeling alone and not being happy). Then new year comes with pressure to be a ""new you"" and also often leads to reflections about life/purpose/the last year/the years ahead.

1cmlx4p,"I can relate. I'm not close with my family, to the point of moving to another state to be away from them. Just being with them would stress me out and make me angry. People who are generally self absorbed can't put themselves into someone elses' shoes. They're also usually completely unaware of the behavior that may have led to someone being that way. I'm also the ""quiet"" one in the family. But I'm quiet because they all just tend to piss me off.

You're not alone. While I don't think its worth it to start stuff with your family, you do need a way to let out that angry before it bursts. Anger has a lot of energy attached, and I'd first recommend things that can expend that energy: exercise, running, biking, boxing, martial arts, etc are usually good options on learning the disciple to control energy and expel it purposefully. The endorphins also can help with mood.

If that's not your thing, Video games, writing, playing music, etc are all ways that similarly require focus and allows you to take out your anger in better outlets. Hell, Sims 4 is free‚Äîmake your family and torture them. Or play a game where you defeat enemies.

And then after the extreme edge of the anger is off, you need to make sure you're doing something restful and relaxing. Anger and stress, even just bottled inside, is hard on the body. Find the self soothing techniques that work for you.

If none of that is helping, you may consider seeing your doctor. Something like a mood stabilizer or an anxiety medication may give you that push you need to make the practical stuff more effective.

1cmhxen,"I may not have best advice, but I think some of these things could helpful. I tend to think those who are skeptical of mental illness do better viewing medical resources themselves, not being told about it‚Äìat least at first. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder) and [StatPearls](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430883/) are basic starting points.¬†

The DSM-5-TR pdf is available for free online. She should read the criteria and the subsequent information. It is very informative and will briefly explain the symptoms, epidemiology, the course, and more.¬†

Highlighting a biological aspect of the condition is helpful; this is touched on in Wikipedia and StatPearls as well. ‚ÄúPersonality disorder‚Äù is sometimes viewed as a misnomer that contributes to the stigma. This American Journal of Psychiatry editorial is brief but very informative: [An Opioid Deficit in Borderline Personality Disorder: Self-Cutting, Substance Abuse, and Social Dysfunction](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10040634). Further support of an endogenous opioid deficiency includes the off-label benefits of naltrexone in self-harm.¬†

Your self-accountability is greatly appreciated in those who doubt mental illness. I feel it comes closer to their viewpoint of human experience. Your emotions are more intense than others and sometimes get the best of you, but it still doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs appropriate or you can‚Äôt participate in healing and improvement over time. I think this gives them a middle ground that opens them up to the possibility of hearing those w/ mental illness out.¬†

I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs now. I‚Äôve been off them for the better part of 20 years. I‚Äôve had rough times, and fantastic times. I‚Äôve learned to ride out both until I get to a baseline level.

Also - **research everything**. Any issue or question you have, look it up! Glean info, research, and experiences from places like this wonderful subreddit! Even scholarly studies have helped me. Seeing what others do for a certain issue can help greatly. Last but not least - therapy. The value of a good therapist can never be overstated.

1cmc762,"I think it ultimately depends on the individual on whether or not they will have to be medicated for the rest of their life or not. I agree with the above comment in that it seems like we all kinda at least go through something like this, feeling discouraged by the idea of always relying on medication & wanting to test & see if we can go without it. I‚Äôve been on meds since I was 17, but for the first couple years I went without them more than I did with them. Eventually I came to terms with the fact that they help me, & when I don‚Äôt take them, things can get unbearably rough. So for the last couple years I‚Äôve made it a habit to take them every day. 

It also helped me to think of it as if it were a medication for a *physical* condition, rather than mental illness. For example, if someone you knew had diabetes, would you think they should be able to tough it out on their own without any insulin? If you had diabetes, would taking insulin regularly make you feel the same way your mental health meds do? 

That being said, I do believe it is possible for some of us to reach a point that we don‚Äôt *have* to be medicated anymore, & if that‚Äôs the case, that‚Äôs great! There‚Äôs no point in spending money & putting meds in your body that you don‚Äôt need, so since you‚Äôve already told your psychiatrist about it, I think it‚Äôs worth exploring how you do without your meds if it‚Äôs what you want (& since your doctor is also interested in seeing how it goes). But if you find yourself needing some medication still, that‚Äôs okay too. It‚Äôs a bit of a trial & error run but it‚Äôs all about finding what works well for you while keeping yourself healthy. :)",psychmonkies,False,1715142536.0

Most of the time, I have really bad anxiety posting on Reddit, but replaying to comments is my hardest challenge. So, again, thank you for your sweet words. 

Sometimes I'm still scared that he will leave me, hurt me, assault me or whatever. But I learned one really important thing; I'm not making myself think like this. It's my bpd that wants me to believe such thoughts, not even in a self-destructive way, but to protect me ""just in case"". It's scary, but it's also touching. My bpd used to protect me, and I have been in situations where I was very thankful for that. But now i have a beautiful man to protect me. As time goes by, I'm saying ""thank you"" and ""goodbye"" to my bpd copings/behaviours I don't need anymore. It's okay if they show up now and then. They sure have their reasons haha

We deserve love so much. And to experience how amazing love is with the right person. In your life you'll find out what love is, learning from moments where you thought there was love, but there actually wasn't. We didn't deserve the hard and challenging life lessons, all the trauma we went through, but it shaped us to the person we are today. 

I think we don't want anyone to go through what we've been through. That makes us the greatest partners in the center of our hearts. We know what is needed, to be loved, even though we missed that part in a big part of our lives. It's not strange, that we don't know how to act on finding love, when we didn't get to experience genuine love before. 

Keep practicing healthy behaviour and skills. You'll get there. 
And one last thing, in the journey of finding love, don't forget to love yourselves!

He did. 3 months went by and we spoke once in a while on Instagram. In August we started dating and I didn't want a monogamous relationship. Not because I was interested in other people, I was afraid of him hurting me, cheating etc. So if the relationship wouldn't be monogamous, i wouldn't end up hurt. This man gave me all the time to figure it out. He was by my side.  

So one advice: check the red and green flags by one simple question!
""I like you, but leave me alone"". If someone leaves you alone, it's a green flag.

Because when we do not take care of ourselves first, we are unable to do our best at helping others. As someone with BPD, I‚Äôm sure you can imagine how difficult it can be to keep yourself healthy consistently. This person was having mental health needs that urgently needed to be met, & despite how it affected the clients at their work (although I‚Äôm sure they have already felt their fair share of guilt from it), they did what was *necessary* for their own wellbeing. And while it may not look like a good decision, it was probably the best decision. The alternative would‚Äôve included them staying for longer than they had the mental capacity for & being unable to give adequate care to their clients.

Do you know how soul crushing that abandonment feels when you‚Äôre giving everything you can to trust this person and open up, just for them to go ghost? Maybe this hasn‚Äôt happened to you before, so you‚Äôre unable to empathize, but this can send someone with BPD over the edge! And the fact everyone‚Äôs kind of just ignoring that is mind boggling to me. I understand that therapists are people too and need to focus on themselves, which is why I told the commenter that I sincerely hope they‚Äôre in a better place now and to not let their mental health trick them into thinking they‚Äôre not capable as a therapist, because I know our thoughts can be overwhelming and can deceive us. However, without a doubt, there was a much more progressional way to go about departing from their profession, and that‚Äôs undebatable. Stating ‚Äúthat‚Äôs shameful‚Äù at the end of my comment was probably harsh and loaded, that I apologize for, I just let my own emotions take me over but regardless that was unwarranted. but I just hope that type of behavior isn‚Äôt normalized in a field where mentally unstable people depend on you, that‚Äôs all.

1cmak20,"Yes, I have actually. A therapist I was seeing specifically for helping me process my trauma, who I had spilled all of the darker parts of my life out to, ghosted me. After weeks & months of attempting to get in touch with her about scheduling another appointment & never hearing back, I decided to contact the head office of her work & ask for an appointment there. That‚Äôs when I learned she no longer worked there. Idk what happened or even exactly at what point she left, but I was given no warning. I do remember feeling confused & frustrated that I was never notified as her client. I remember feeling like it was unfair, inconvenient for me as she was the only therapist specialized in certain trauma therapies in my area. So I am able to empathize on how that experience can trigger feelings abandonment. But I am also able to empathize with the person you were replying to, you have to remember, *they have BPD too.* From what I can tell, I don‚Äôt think the other commenter has completely given up the profession. It sounds like they were going through something & needed to take a break, but bc that specific employer wasn‚Äôt easily allowing that, they had to leave. I‚Äôm sure it still possible for them continue counseling under another employer, hopefully somewhere that does better at helping counselors take care of their own needs. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs becoming normalized & it is highly discouraged for people in that position to leave their job so suddenly, bc of reasons like you are mentioning. So when possible, yes there should be more steps to help clients adjust to the change before they leave‚Äîbut sometimes that may not be doable. And in those cases, it‚Äôs still unfortunate for the clients, yes, but I think this thread gives us an opportunity to see it from the other perspective, to consider if the hurt we felt when ghosted by our therapists was directed at us & an indicator of how difficult we may be as clients like we may have feared‚Äîor if it could‚Äôve be something as innocent as them going through something themselves & being put in a position where they just aren‚Äôt able to continue counseling for a while, something completely not personal to us.

what helped me, and pls don't throw rocks at me, is affirmations and little conversations with my inner child. i've put everything into changing my inner monologue from negative to positive. and the crazy part is that it has worked. i believe that i am worthy, consistent and smart. i believe that i can do hard things. that i am persistent.  
if you repeat it enough times, you will believe it. more, you will start acting like it's the truth.

i also pictured myself as a 5 y.o. little, innocent, before SA. i was abandoned as a child a lot, and with this come a lot of believes about self-worth. so i picture little me and tell her things that tbh adults in my life should've said. like, i love you. i will always be with you. i will love you when you're hurt, i will love you when you're happy. i will protect you. i will be there for you, no matter what. there's so much to love about you, etc, you get it 

i've spent my whole life hating myself, critisizing every small step and mistake, calling myself names. i had a suicide attempt when i was 16, which wrecked my life pretty hard. so believe me when i'm telling you that positive, loving inner voice will provide you a solid foundation for day-to-day life things. you will trust yourself more. maybe with this trust you will be able to be bold enough to try new things that you think you might like (not cuz of fp, but cuz you yourself felt interested in it). i picked up drawing like this a month ago. by myself! and i enjoy it a lot. and also, talking about unbelievable things, i worked pretty hard learning how to code and got accepted to a programming camp.  
after all the things that i've failed in, it was easy to believe that i just can't do shit. that i am useless failure, good for nothing dumbass with no future. it was hard to unlearn this hate, but through affirmations and daily effort i did. the trick works. at least try it.

However, it's also crucial to show ourselves grace and understanding when we struggle with those behaviors.

When you're ready to pursue a new relationship, you can use these lessons to make it healthier.

I suggest taking some time to be alone and focus on finding yourself again. It's common for us to lose ourselves in relationships to avoid dealing with our underlying issues.

It was a hell. I still hated myself but I knew it wasn't always like that. I focused on rediscovering myself and 'went back in time' to do all the things that used to make me happy. Some were a miss like making jewellery - even though I do find it relaxing, but some were lit, like playing instruments, playing games again, listening to the music and watching shows everyone used to laugh at. I stopped caring about what other people say about what I like. After all it's my life to live and whatever makes me happy is the thing worth clinging too and defending. Those who laughed... It only reflected on them what kind of people they are (judgemental idiots) and was a marker for me that I don't want to be close with them in any way. Simple.

Since I rediscovered myself, resumed old and found new hobbies, I stopped caring if people are present, if they message me immediately or not.

But she simply wasn't capable of returning any of that, or if taking any responsibility for the way that she would be behave for the things that she would say.

I'm sure he does care about you, he just can't cross that line. He probably has other clients, it wouldn't be fair to them for him to meet with you on days he's off.

Remember that your therapist isn't there to be your friend or lifeline‚Äîhe is a mentor there to support your and provide guidance that you pay for. He has to keep this professional and impersonal.

1cld898,"1. If watching tv to go to bed helps you then it helps you. Forget what society says. They don‚Äôt speak for all of us. I mean watching tv to go to bed is better than popping a pill every night that you get addicted to and fall into a deeper depression right. Or drinking yourself to sleep. 

2. Yes meditation. It takes time and patience but it does help. Meditation isn‚Äôt meant to clear your mind - after all your mind‚Äôs one job is to think right? Meditation teaches you to acknowledge whatever thought that comes through without judgement and then letting it go and going back to your breathing until the next thought pops up, and you repeat this cycle. Thoughts are just thoughts - they‚Äôre not real. I suggest starting small with 5 minute guided meditation videos you can find on YouTube and slowly increasing the time, or not. 

3. Try reading to sleep, find a fun page-turner. And if you‚Äôre not a reader then try an audiobook or podcast, this way unlike with tv you can close your eyes and have no blue rays affecting your sleep.

Overcoming overthinking falls into the dbt skill of mindfulness. I think practising mindfulness can help build your ability to be more present in the moment instead of caught up in your thoughts. But mindfulness doesnt have to mean ""meditation"" in the traditional sense. For example, instead of sitting down to meditate and trying to ""clear your mind"" y could instead mindfully make a cup of tea (eg. Focus on each little step, look at what youre doing, no multitasking, take in the smells/sights/temperature/taste). Your mind WILL start to wander during this. The part which makes it mindfulness is when you notice your mind is wandering, acknowledge it without judgement and refocus back onto what you are doing. Do that as many times as you need to.

I can't speak for every country, but in several, a therapist can get fired for sharing information to your parents. 18 means you are legally an adult, and a therapist will have no power or allowance to share what you say in therapy to anyone else. The only thing they are allowed to do is call authorities if they feel you are a danger to yourself or others, or if there is a court case is which they must give the info. This is likely never going to happen. If a therapist shares info with your parents without your consent, you can take legal action. Therapists are bound to confidentiality. They almost certainly will not share anything with your parents.

I hope that provides a bit of stress relief. I'll get back to this after some sleep. It's a very very brave and selfless thing to do to try something that you're uncomfortable with for the sake of bettering yourself. You don't sound self centered at all.

Going back a little bit, my mom a while ago wanted me to go to therapy and was trying to force me. Now that I‚Äôm more acceptable to the idea this sounds like it would be great but she was forcing me with the intention that she‚Äôll pay for it BUT i‚Äôll have to agree that she‚Äôs told everything I tell the therapist.

I don‚Äôt really have any reason to be sad though, I often wish bad things would happen to me so I would at least have an excuse to feel bad. Does that make any sense? What would you suggest I do?

1cl8swh,"Everything you've said makes sense. You are a legal adult‚Äîeven if your mom pays for it, she can't legally demand information from your therapist based on confidentiality laws. I don't know where you live so I would double check your country's laws, but most places don't allow therapists to break confidentiality.

If you have the capability of getting something private, that'd be great! And universities usually have some resources for mental health too. All of those options are good. I would personally take advantage of your mom's payment though and give it a shot. If your mom IS receiving info from the therapist, you can get that therapist in trouble and try one of your plan Bs. But yeah I imagine your mom has no legal standing on getting info from your therapist. You are the patient, and you control who is and isn't told. Your therapist can help explain this to your mom perhaps.",princefruit,False,1715026736.0
1cl8swh,"I don't feel obligated. I genuinely enjoy helping people!

So to reply in full: When you see a therapist, you will have to fill out paperwork. One of these papers will be the confidentiality agreement. Make sure you read over it carefully. (Read all of the paperwork carefully lol). It'll almost ***certainly*** mention that the therapist agrees to keep all of your information confidential‚Äîthis is standard with therapy. You can also ask your therapists directly about what can and cannot report. Again, you being 18, your parents are not your 'guardians' for the purpose of this‚Äîyou are being treated as a legal adult, and your parents' only role in this might be if YOU list them as your emergency contact. And Emergency Contact doesn't mean sharing your info‚Äîit means if for any reason you get hospitalized in therapy, they can contact whoever you put to tell them that you were put in the hospital. That's about as far as they can go legally. And you do not have to list parents as an emergency contact.

As for your symptoms‚Äîwhile we can't diagnose you, a lot of this is in alignment with borderline, or cluster b symptoms. Not that a diagnosis matters‚Äîyou still can benefit a ton from the right therapy whether you have the full disorder or just traits. The treatment is the same.

What I would do, is copy what you wrote here regarding your symptoms. When you've established a therapist, you can email this list, print it out and give it to your therapist, or read it to them in your session. A therapist can only help you when you're honest. Talking in person can be stressful. Writing whats in your head and sharing it can be a really good way to make sure you don't forget something. Ideally, your therapist will go through these one at a time, to discuss them further.

Also, have a goal in mind for your therapist: do you want to just learn how to cope? Do you want to get to the root causes of your symptoms? Try to figure out maybe 1-3 goals you have, and share with your therapist. That gives your therapist some direction in how to tackle your sessions.

Also, Also, If your therapist is being unhelpful, upsetting, or anything that makes you feel uncomfortable or unproductive, you need to share that with them. Everyone has different needs in therapy, and it may take your therapist some trial and error, and some direction from you. Therapy should be a challenge, and there may be times when it is emotionally taxing, but it shouldn't be making your symptoms worse over all.

Be patient with your therapist, but if a month or so has passed and you see nothing hopeful about that therapist, move on to a new one. 'Therapist Shopping' is not just normal but encouraged‚Äîyou may not meet the right therapist right away. You're paying for this service with money and time, get what you're paying for.

The biggest fear and misconception people have with therapy is that the therapist is in the position of power. That's not true here. A therapists' job is to guide you, and you're expected to be open to that guidance, but ***you*** are the one that controls how you want to be treated. If they break your trust or mistreat you, you can report them. You have the power in the dynamic, don't let yourself think that you're stuck or deserving of any mistreatment. You CAN speak up to them, and you CAN get up and leave if it isn't working.

Most therapists mean well though. I'm glad you're giving them a chance. Don't be discouraged if it doesn't work out‚Äîmost people go through a few therapists before they find the 'right' one. But do remember you are allowed and encouraged to give them feedback to better help you.",princefruit,False,1715026338.0
1cl8swh,"Okay, thank you so much!! :) ‚ù§Ô∏è 
I‚Äôm still definitely nervous and knowing myself but I might back out last minute again but I‚Äôm going to keep trying to force myself. I should ask though, is it worth it going if I don‚Äôt consider these things to be problems? While I do freak out at minor things, most major ‚Äúbad‚Äù things I my life, other actually care more about them than I do. People have told me in the past that I should care more when these things happen and that they are big problems but I don‚Äôt see it that way. The reason I bring this up is, it might affect my work if I start viewing these things as problems and it might only lead to me being more upset, while right now I‚Äôm fine with them. For example I would freak out at getting a shitty grade for something I worked hard on or playing poorly in a sports team. But things that wouldn‚Äôt affect me that much are people dying, or people touching me supposedly inappropriately. Then again, it really changes depending on my mood. And if you‚Äôd like I can go more in detail I just didn‚Äôt want to freak you out!

Just because you don't see them as problems doesn't mean that you can't benefit from therapy. Even people who are healthy can benefit from therapy. You don't need to change your perspective. You can say ""I don't think these are problems, but I still would like to learn how to not freak out over things like my grades"". We can all better ourselves in some way and therapy can be a good way to do that! Just like a lot of people upgrade their phones before their old phone is broken, we can improve ourselves for the little things even if we're not broken :) I'd give it a shot.

It's a long story, but my strong emotional reactions were draining the ""friends"" around me. But instead of telling me that, one of them lied that I assaulted them, and then they all just ganged up on me before kicking me out.

Anyways that's not important. The important thing was what I learned:

1. You have to communicate. You have to be clear with your feelings and *why* you feel them. It's not enough to just say ""I feel worthless,"" ""I feel upset."" Okay... why? How do we solve this? What would help you? You need to know the answers to those questions, even if it's easier said than done. And sometimes there won't be a reason and that's okay too.

2. You have to be kind to yourself. If a friend was feeling the way you were feeling, would you say the same things to them? That they should've just kept their mouth shut? That they're a burden? No-- at least I hope you wouldn't! But in that same way, you have to show up for you.

3. People suck ass. People suck ass sometimes and that's fine. They have permission to leave your life. Sometimes it's better that way because you get to a point where the person is just no longer providing good enrichment. I don't mean they don't provide benefits to you, but I mean do they support you, do they listen, are you both able to have fun together, etc. Because that's what you deserve. And it's okay if they don't do all those things, but it just means you won't be as close.

4. Sometimes, you just gotta get comfortable with being alone. After a really shitty incident and lots of losses, I haven't dated in a year. I don't really have close friends. I only have one girl I talk to every other day, and we aren't super emotionally open all the time. But during this time period I've kinda learned that I need to get a better sense of who/what I am before I invite more people in. I haven't engaged with my hobbies for years because I was constantly distracted by some bullshit trauma. I'm in a better place where I can process everything that's happened to me. I can engage in hobbies again. It's a slow business, but I'll make it there one day. And you will too. You will find a whole self outside of that relationship one day. You just have to nurture them.

One of the best pieces of advice during my journey that I've seen was treating yourself like you're your own partner. Imagine you're dating you. What would you do for them? What kind of gifts? Dates? How would you make sure they felt special? Do those things for yourself, and you will begin to feel more whole.",LaserBatBunnyUnder,False,1714966973.0
1cl7yw0,"yes, and even though their reasons for wanting to split are valid and it should be accepted, it HURTS. i think having bpd makes the whole process of healing just DRAG. i was with an ex for about 3 years before he broke up with me, and it took me almost that amount of time to even begin thinking about another relationship. there were times it felt like it wouldn‚Äôt end, times i was even suicidal over it because i couldn‚Äôt see myself ever finding someone else i loved as much as him. my advice to you is to genuinely focus on yourself. that could mean anything depending on the person, i took that time to learn to forgive myself, accept his decision, and get to know the person i was when i was alone with myself. i started exercising, playing with my pets a little longer, made a self-care routine and really stuck to it, cooking for fun, etc. some self-reflection will only better prepare you to do better next time. im here for you if you would like to dm, i hear you, and i know how badly it hurts but i promise you it‚Äôs not forever no matter how much it feels like it. 

also, i know i said it up there, but it really is important to respect his decision to split if he is solid on it. small talk and unnecessary conversations will make this so much harder on you. i dont know if yall will have to return belongings or anything like that, but when all is said and done, sticking to 100% no contact is the only way i was able to get him out of my head. i blocked all social media accounts of his as well because if you can check it, you will, and it‚Äôll only hurt you more no matter what you see.",bbyfrost,False,1714980679.0

1cl7yw0,"Yes, although I wasn't diagnosed at the time. Looking back, it was definitely because of my bpd. I'm 22, and I've only had two serious relationships. I'm married to my high school sweetheart, which blows my mind every day that he stayed throughout all my bs. We did break up for a year at one point in high school, and I got into another relationship very quickly to fill that void. Everything was fine for a while. I was obsessed with him in every way. He was so perfect and amazing... until he wasn't. One day, I suddenly felt so much disgust when I looked at him or when he tried to touch me. It made my skin crawl, I hated him, but I didn't understand why. He hadn't done anything wrong. It got so bad that I started to accuse him of doing things behind my back even when I knew he would never do those things. He began to get tired of it, which is exactly what I wanted. Eventually, he told me he couldn't handle it anymore, and he broke up with me. I sabotaged a perfectly good relationship for absolutely no reason. I cried when he broke up with me because that was the moment I realized something was very wrong with me and because I felt like I'd be alone forever. 

I was lucky enough to have my ex (my now husband) come back into my life and show me that he would accept me for who I am.

Also, understanding some biological component to this is helpful, e.g., research into endogenous opioids, vasopressin, 50% heritability, etc. This is not a life sentence and most people do not meet criteria ten years out. Certain symptoms are thought to naturally reduce w/ time/age. It often co-occurs w/ other mental health conditions, which should be considered to explain (not necessarily excuse) behavior and struggles/difficulties. Informing yourself is helpful. There‚Äôs tons of YouTube videos of BPD documentaries, patient testimonies/advice, psychiatry and counseling advice, info for families, etc. 

There‚Äôs communication recommendations to engage w/ intense emotional responses (or emotional crises) w/ general support-reminders as well as validation of feelings, not necessarily support of their actions. Their feelings are always their own and they can be well beyond what most people experience. Their feelings suck.

1cl1q1l,"When a man is emotionally unavailabe/narcissistic,  we do feel this intuitively, and our fight or flight response is triggered. We actually confuse this fight or flight response for ""butterflies"" or ""a spark"" , and so we think we feel an energetic connection to them, not knowing it's our fight or flight response. I think one reason this happens, is because when we are struggling with depression, numbness, and emptiness, which we feel very intensely, it's a very ""down"" state and so therefore we are going to be very attracted to anything that causes us to feel an ""up"" state. when our fight or flight response is triggered with men like this, we get that ""up"" energy. The last time I got obsessed with a man like this, I was in a deep state of depression (as i usually am). I would just be laying there, feeling unable to move or do anything, and then all of a sudden I would get a text from him and immediately feel almost manic, would get a burst of energy and would start cleaning my house, getting things done that I had been putting off all day. This energy was dependant on his text messages, that was a huge red flag but I ignored it.

Bro was a mad narcissist, obsessed with his image, appearance, and body and would only talk about himself - would literally not even respond to anything i say but continue his inner fucking monologue of whatever‚Äôs on his mind. And .. AND he was also terrified of physical intimacy? Wouldn‚Äôt let us sleep touching? I never expected any physical intimacy nor tried to initiate because I never wanted to pressure him (yet he wanted me to still acts for him). He finally got with me after I lost a significant amount of weight and still made me insecure with constant gaslighting about his clearly inappropriate interactions with other girls and he would never take me on dates or do anything. Sometimes he would tell me to come back to his when I was out or I wouldn‚Äôt be welcome making me feel bad for being with friends. He would self diagnose himself with things but wouldn‚Äôt ever consider seeing a therapist or any professional and instead expected me to validate his shit. 


I think I was head over heels for him for the fact that he felt like a challenge, like a game of cat and mouse where some days he would want me and others he wouldn‚Äôt. I would get hurt by him and then reclaim my power by being distant and not giving him attention, resulting in him wanting me more.

1ckxrnf,"This really sounds exhausting. I'm sorry you have to go through this. 
I think drawing the character is a really good idea. But I think it's also important to focus on yourself and not too much on the character. 
Maybe try writing a DBT pro and con list. Its about short and long term pro and con. What is your short term pro ? Giving up and following the impulse and maybe you're satisfied because the urge is gone. 
But please try to think about the negative consequences of your action (especially long term).
If you really do this you will be disabled for the rest of your life. You will feel immense pain over a long period of time. You have to live with this for the rest of your life.(Just to make a few). I know the urge to do it is strong but is it really worth it ? Don't you think living with the consequences will be way more awful than the burden of the urge right now ? Especially if you already know that you will obsess over something else pretty quick. 
I also think you should talk with your therapist about the reason why you obsess over these characters and adopt their style and personalities. A big part of BPD is not knowing who we are and having no identity. So we adopt other ones. You have to find out who YOU are. What you like and what your style.

I find that people stare at me a lot, but they kinda already did before. I dress in all black and I'm kind of extravagant it makes people stare. Also because I have huge facial scars I get looks too.
I know this is because I also have histrionic personality disorder but I fucking love the attention I can never have enough. Sometimes it feels like I want even more people to stare at me 
But also sometimes I panic a lot and wonder wtf is wrong with me that makes people stare so much when I really don't feel okay.
It kinda switches around which is weird 

And yeah people probably think I'm fucking crazy 
One of the nurse at the psych ward that asked why I was wearing one and was kinda laughing when doing so 
I looked dead at him and said because I want to rip my eye out he went silent and just left 
He probably thought I was crazy but I didn't care 
Other nurses were nicer than him of course but yeah.
I've had a psychiatrist say I looked imposing (don't know how since I was dressed in a hospital gown and a blanket but whatever ) I told him thanks
And he replied with that's not a compliment.
Like damn alright thanks for insulting me I guess but I still took it as a compliment 
Maybe I'm just fucked up

Honestly I've just kind of accepted I make people stare and that doing shit like that probably makes them think I'm insane.
I just don't really care and take the attention and feed the void inside of me that needs to be validated 

Admittedly it's unhealthy but if it helps then whatever 

What I found that really bothers me is that my best friend (who hates attention and that's fine ) gets very uncomfortable going at with me and hasn't done so in 3 years now because apparently she never saw that many people stare at one person.
I understand she hates attention and it makes her nervous but damn do I wish she would still go out with me. Last time we did it was for grocery shopping and she had enough

It‚Äôs easier to work on yourself without the distraction of dating. Focus on the relationships you currently have like the one with yourself, with your family/friends, pets, colleagues, neighbors. But don‚Äôt stick to just one person or just one circle.  Make time for different groups. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and a lot of research goes a long way to learn how to recognize and deal with the impulses we get. 

I am generally much happier single, it has made me love myself more. I want to have a partner someday but not until i know Im mentally strong enough to not inflict my trauma on others.

Always remember that you cannot help others when you cannot help yourself. You can love someone and be incompatible. And why I'm not saying that giving up is the only solution, if you guys can't come to a point where *both* of your needs are being met, then you just might not be compatible at partners.

I would start by having a talk and setting some boundaries. Boundaries don't need to be just about keeping someone at bay. A boundary can be, ""I understand you need your space, but I need you to check in every couple of days."" Maybe figure out what her needs from you are, and tell her what you need. What can you compromise on? Meeting in the middle is important.

It sounds like you may also be struggling with some attachment issues and some codependency. Don't forget to give yourself the same support that you give her.

When I say distance, try to think in nuances. 
It can be small things like distancing yourself from certain topics with a boundary.
‚ÄûI dont want to talk about this subject.‚Äú

You dont have to give a reason, but you can.
There is both a philosophical _and_ medical perspective to mental illness, so its rather an opinion than a fact.  
There is a reason why the word _psychopolitcs_ exist. 

Try to keep it in mind, when you are confronted with people diagnosing you without consent.

‚ÄûI see. Mhm.‚Äú

We are all emotional, but its about the intensity that makes or breaks it.
The magic word is: social adequately expression/regulation of emotions.
They say there is a time and place for feelings.
Its maybe the result of a structured society. Where everything is in order.

You see the issue with regulating the emotions is often a part of what makes borderline.
The intense emotions lead to impulsive action.
But thats just how emotions work.
The power comes in seeing the emotions build up before its too high, but that takes experience knowing yourself.
Which ironically is when the symptoms of BPD lessen. I think its around 40-50.

For example getting pissed off at really small things, but staying happy and seemingly unaffected when supposedly major bad things happen to me. Or being very lovey dovey and hugging others at one point and then an hour later wanting to sit in side for the rest of the day in my bed.

bpd or not, healthy or not, there is nothing inherently wrong with having struggles, big or small. it pains me to read that you consider your issues not ""real,"" as there is no such thing. if it hurts you, if it affects you, that is real enough. some things might not be *logical*, but that doesn't mean the feelings behind them aren't real. unfortunately, it is difficult to differentiate between those when you're doing it on your own. please, please consider finding those healthy outlets. it is an incredibly difficult and vulnerable thing to do, but it's also a brave thing to do. there's so much stigma and misinformation, fear and hate, not only from others, but also from ourselves. but we deserve to have the best opportunities and environments for us to thrive, and you are not taking away from others by allowing the space to give to yourself. you're human too. i wish you all the best and you'll be in my thoughts ‚ù§Ô∏èü´∂",stripedbee,False,1714860359.0

So I had quite a lot of time without them by now. I don't hate my siblings like at all. I'm just deeply sorry for them cause I know the hell they went through. In regard to my mother I just don't want to see her ever again. She's a bitter, spiteful, depressed, sad person. It's not like I hate her it's just I reaaaaaaally don't want to interact with her. In regard to my father it's ambiguous. I always describe it as ""I hate for for everything you did *to* me and I love you for everything you did *for* me."".

1cjy8zo,"The majority of folks who have BPD experienced trauma. It‚Äôs not fair and you didn‚Äôt deserve it. BPD comes from hereditary genes, brain structure and environment and while not trying to invalidate anyone‚Äôs pain, trauma alone does not cause BPD and you can still be diagnosed without trauma. The one thing that we know is folk with BPD have an emotional baseline that is ten times stronger than those without BPD, thus every feeling towards others words/actions or even perception is interpreted and causes significant painful and overwhelming feelings. It‚Äôs a long answer but not individuating at age two left folks with BPD (and other personality disorders like NPD) not developing or failing to go through the normal introject process that happens with individuation. BPD in the US can now be diagnosed at age 12 and with new research coming out all the time, there are more resources to help parents identify BPD in young children. If you were hurt, it‚Äôs normal to hate but it‚Äôs also important to recognize the relationships in your life where you loved and hated and see the pattern. BPD is the most painful mental disorder to live with. Folks didn‚Äôt ask for it and it‚Äôs in no way their fault. Of course we hate people that hurt us but I just caution folks that with BPD comes perceptions that aren‚Äôt accurate, memory lapses, folks take on others feelings when others don‚Äôt (it‚Äôs not that anyone was upset with you but you make others feelings about you), and while very intuitive, studies show that folks with BPD read neutral faces as angry while those without BPD see those expressions as neutral. People can feel invalidated without someone saying their feelings were wrong or trivial. That‚Äôs an internal feeling but may not actually be what a partner or other person thinks or feels. If you don‚Äôt feel worthy or need other people to make you feel better, this is because you don‚Äôt have object consistency. The exterior world defines how you feel. People (even children) can understand that their parent is mad or upset with them but also knows that they still love them and it‚Äôs not a question. For example, if a person feels that they get less attention than a sibling, this may not be accurate but an internal feeling that only they have. Other people even parents have their own needs and feelings and if you never individuated (stuck in symbiotic phase, which happens with BPD) this continuity is not something the brain processes. I‚Äôm in no way saying anyone wasn‚Äôt abused or hurt and I work with people in BPD families all the time to understand that their love one isn‚Äôt doing certain things on purpose at all but unconsciously and its a survival mechanism. Truthfully scientific evidence that has been published in medical journals links sexual abuse as the predominant environmental factor to BPD as well as parental abandonment. If your brain feels ten times more impulse and you have ten times more negative emotions, it‚Äôs how you feel. The hard part is that other people don‚Äôt feel the same or think the same and this is what creates the hallmark feature of BPD which is unstable relationships. Your feelings are real and valid but part of therapy like DBT is not only working on soothing your own feelings but gaining awareness and insight into how others without BPD feel differently and how you affect others as well a how they are are confused and don‚Äôt understand you.",Humble-Bee-428,False,1714857817.0

1cju336,"I second it. I'm 30 and I went through DBT two years ago, it was a 6 months course, 3 hours of group sessions once a week. At first I was sceptical but when I fully committed and just gave myself away and did everything that group facilitators asked us to, I started noticing small differences in how I react to people and life events. It took time, commitment and many fails before learning emotional regulation. Now I finally see why people would 'forget about me' when inviting everyone around, but me. I can see what mistakes I have made when choosing my friends and partners, and I'm trying to learn from it and not do the same thing again. 

If I can only suggest the OP one thing: download DBT workbooks and at least once a week try doing one chapter of it, with a full dedication. Not everything works for everyone, so some skills may deem ineffective for you, so try to remember those that do. Don't fight it, embrace it.

And now, I just hope you find some peace regardless circumstances. You do deserve better and you deserve to hear why you weren't invited. You can't know for sure what the reason is.

1cjpufo,"I want you to know, first and foremost, that you are not a burden. It can be difficult for people like us to find ourselves, as we often get lost and influenced by those around us. We struggle to deal with our own minds, as you mentioned it can be a challenging place to be. However, you can try to trick your mind into enjoying alone time and use it as an opportunity to work on yourself. I am not suggesting that you stop your habits, as that will only make it harder to break them. What I ask is that you become aware of when you engage in your habits and pay attention to every little detail leading up to it. Try to break it down emotionally and think about everything. I know it is tough, especially when you are in a difficult headspace, but there are others out there who are also suffering, myself included.

My problem has always been rushing to get things done, but now I am taking a pause and reflecting on everything. For example, I sleep on a futon cushion on the floor four nights out of the week, as I pushed my partner to a point where they no longer trust me or feel safe with me. It is important to find a solid foundation from which to build upon.

Sex, drinking and smoking were instant gratifications I used to abuse  too. Try to replace them with a workout or a dance, or stand-up comedy, a walk in nature, funny videos - these will all give you the same instant dopamine boosts.

Knowing I have 1 day wfh has actually reduced my anxiety drastically because I know I can save it to use when I actually need it without always having to explain to my line manager why I need my space.

If someone feels that you hurt their feelings it may be difficult for you to understand this because it‚Äôs not how you felt or feeling the guilt is incredibly painful.

1cjllnp,"A few things: BPD affects areas of the brain related to impulse control and negative emotions. BPD is from hereditary genes, brain structure and environment. The majority of those with BPD experienced trauma in childhood but you can still be diagnosed with BPD if you did not have trauma (trauma correlates but does not directly cause BPD). As a baby, you have a symbiotic connection with your parent (s), (basically you‚Äôre one). When you individuate at age two and become separate, developmentally children created introjects of others in their mind (object consistency). This means that when you interact with the world you have your parent (s) or other loved ones in your mind (their face, voice etc) and it provides a safety internally that your safe when interacting with others. Those with BPD have an introject failure. This means when parent(s) or caregivers were not physically in the same room as a toddler, the toddler doesn‚Äôt have an introject of them. The connection is not continued without their presence so they feel empty. They stay in the symbiotic phase. How they compensate for this relying on external people to regulate those intense feelings of fear, anxiety and loneliness. It‚Äôs not conscious, it‚Äôs how you relate to the world. This is the foundation of the personality disorder. It‚Äôs why there is no cure. Fear of abandonment, people pleasing, and all the other traits that are present in BPD are an unconscious way of living to ensure survival as being alone with scary and intense (often debilitating) emotions are painful and scary.",Humble-Bee-428,False,1714837780.0

I have found that my disorder traits help massively because I can put myself in the shoes of things that can't necessarily speak, like the flock of hummingbirds, leafcutter ants, and poison dart frogs that reside next to the mining site.

I feel like others might disagree, but I think the mask is ultimately the most helpful thing we have, and I really hope I'm not guessing wrong about the mask thing here lol.  IMHO I don't think it's ever a good thing (professionally at least) to ever show strong over the top emotions; both positive and negative.  I truly believe we can think whatever we want, but showing anything that's extreme is ultimately not helpful to anything really.  Like I said, this goes for rampaging anger and also elation.  Sure, you should show dissatisfaction and also satisfaction, but the key is professionalism.  The mask really helps me appear to be level headed to who it matters to appear that way, and all professional relations fall into this category.

As far as identity goes:  This one is tough for me BUT only because it's tough for literally everyone to view themselves objectively.  I \*feel\* like a loser, and I \*feel\* unstable, and I \*feel\* like I haven't accomplished anything, and I \*feel\* like I'm just a bad person, buuuut if I step outside of myself I can make a list of things that I've done and thus judge myself off my actions, not thoughts.  If you remove what you \*think\* you might be and give yourself no choice but to look at you based on actions alone, you'll actually be quite surprised in a positive way.  I am assuming that you want to get better and are working on yourself while not actively manipulating, lying, cheating, and/or taking the morally easy way out, then I can also assume you are better than most and should give yourself credit.  You are your actions, and it should be at the top of your list to be a good actioned person.  At that point, what you think doesn't fucking matter cuz you got proof you are what you actually are.

Seeing a psych can be intimidating but theyre usually really nice! The process varies depending on your country. In my country, the first step is usually to get a referral from your GP. The referral means the government helps pay for some of your sessions. Some countries also have youth specific services (often up to 25year olds) which are free.

Then to book with the psych you just email/call and say you want a first appointment. The first appointment usually costs more. You usually go over your mental health history, goals of treatment etc in the first appointment. 

To find a psych do a google of psychs in your area. You can read their bios, look at their picture, see their areas of interest and pick a good psych based off that. If you feel you have a lot of bpd symptoms then finding a psych who knows how to do dialetical behaviour therapy (dbt) would be helpful because this is the best treatment for bpd.",Awesomesauce250,False,1714710154.0

‚ÄúI always thought I might be bad, now I know that‚Äôs it‚Äôs true, cause I think your so good and I‚Äôm nothing like you‚Äù 

100% this is what being borderline feels like! 
 Knowing you‚Äôre bad and it being confirmed by how amazing someone else is, especially your FP 

‚ÄúLook at you go! I just adore you, I wish that I knew ,what makes you think I‚Äôm so special?‚Äù 

When your fp, loves you back! I always tell my husband, I am evil, that I‚Äôm bad, he really genuinely tells me I‚Äôm not and he somehow believes it? What makes him think I‚Äôm special when he‚Äôs the special one!? 

‚Äú If I could begin to be, half of what you think of me, I can do anything I could even learn how to love, like you‚Äù 

if I could be half the person my fp is, then I swear I could do anything, I could even love him the way he loves me! non toxic, normal, healthy. Beautiful non-tainted love.

When I see the way you act , wondering when I‚Äôm coming back, I could do about anything, I could ever learn how to love, like you. 

The way my husband waits for me like I lost puppy melts my heart, because I truly don‚Äôt think my evil self deserves it. When I see him act, so sweet it makes me feel like I could do anything. 

‚Äú if I could begin to do something, that does right by you, I could do about anything, I could even learn how to love, like you‚Äù 

I‚Äôm the biggest fuck up screwup ever I‚Äôm always messing shit up. I swear if I could something right by him I would.  

‚Äúlove me like you‚Äù 

Self love, often unattainable, If I could love myself the way my husband loves me, then I‚Äôll have achieved self love. 

I wish I could love me like you

1cifz48,"Dealing with both is definitely a whirlwind. The things that have helped me develop a much more tame mindset with this really just have to do with reassuring myself. We spend so much time obsessing over what the other is thinking or feeling and if it was good enough, or groundbreaking for them..like it was for us yk. But consistently reminding myself that I am very good at what I can do (even if I can't do some things other girls can), and that is more than good enough. 


Then you can fall down the rabbit hole of ""Are THEY very good at what they can do, and do they even care if they are, like I do?"" If the answer is no to one or both, you start reassuring yourself that you do, in fact, have better things to offer.  And not to say that it isn't hard to train yourself to think like that. With BPD it's a constant battle of considering every single aspect, possible or impossible outcomes, etc. Especially when dealing with sex. There's so much more room for overthinking and festering and emotions in general. 


However I think that's the important thing to remember about hypersexuality. It's unfiltered. It's consistent for the most part. It is at the end of the day, more physical than emotional. And I think it's good to remind yourself that hypersexuality can be separate from your BPD. Or at least we can trick ourselves into believing we have that control. Let your hypersexuality be the one part of you that you are comfortable in knowing the details of inside and out. BPD is uncertain, and a jungle of thoughts and feelings. Hypersexuality can just be about your naturally high sex drive.


Like the other have said, accept it for what it is, and be okay with letting it go. Do you think you have desirable sexual traits? Whether it be what you can do, or say, or how a certain curve in your body looks? Awesome! That's good enough! If he does too, cool! But does he care?? Probably not. So put it aside. One day there's gonna be someone who is super into your whole deal. Able to work with the hypersexuality (or hypersexual themselves) but with the capacity to actually form a meaningful bond. It's possible. But until you meet someone who can explicitly express their interest in creating a bond, and allowing sex to strengthen it; take sex for what it is. Really cool. Very nice. Take what happened between you two for what it is. It's really cool it happened. And it was very nice. It can be ever more cool, and even more nice with someone else!",WoahIssaMe,False,1714662989.0

And that‚Äôs exactly what my mind is doing.  Despite the compliments I got from certain things I did, I felt like the ‚Äúmain course‚Äù wasn‚Äôt that great even though he did finish and it didn‚Äôt take decades to get him to. 

That‚Äôs also a rabbit hole I‚Äôve fallen down trying to use it to reassure myself. He‚Äôs told me he‚Äôs super awkward around girls he finds attractive but it didn‚Äôt click until I was hanging out with him‚Ä¶that‚Äôs he‚Äôs super awkward around me.

But knowing how we overthink constantly with BPD it makes it hard because you think about it SO MUCH that feelings eventually try show up and then you have to fight those too. It‚Äôs exhausting. 

Yknow, that‚Äôs really good advice. I haven‚Äôt thought about it that way and I will be trying to do that from now on.  I need to become confident with myself in that regard so that I can separate them, knowing that I did best with what I have/know.

1cifz48,"Exactly! I think you're taking away everything you possibly can from the advice you gotten and the coping mechanisms you already have. With BPD, so many things are issues because WE SAY they are issues. I know you didn't want to be told "" Just don't do that."" Buuut, sometimes it really is just that. Almost like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Start small. When you have a slight rise in emotions and overthinking over something virtually unimportant, remind yourself of that. This is actually so not a big deal, so why am I treating like it is? Then execute and treat it well, like not a big deal. Then build your way up from there. 


We are our biggest enemies and our strongest allies. And while it may seem like the BPD is some ugly monster inside and outside (and let's be fair, most days it is), it's really just our absolute most vulnerable selves that have manifested into a plethora of issues in basic daily functionality. Be kind to her. You are all she's got at the end of the day. Work towards being an ally to yourself most days. The confidence thing is SO REAL, and DRASTICALLY changes the way you view the world and what you allow your mind to focus on. 


I definitely think this could be used as motivation to work swiftly in completing your licensing, and moving on! There's a whole world out there.

1ci2h0w,"Sending you so much love.

A diagnosis can be a heavy weight, especially if you're not getting the support you need. I know that its hard, but try to frame diagnosis into a few more realistic points:

* A diagnosis is an answer to a question. By having this answer, you now have a better opportunity to truly understand what is happening, how to cope, and how to communicate about it. It's a *starting* line, not the finish line.
* You are not your diagnosis. It is a part of you, that at times will be consuming. But there is much much much more to us as humans than a disorder.
* Regression sucks but healing is never a straight and linear line upward. Regression, remission, relapse, healing, are all part of the process. I know this sounds a bit like toxic positivity, but genuinely‚Äîthe drive to get better, the motivation to continue seeking the treatments that work for you, and the hope (however small) to not give up, are the keys to healing. With those things, you'll find the stuff that works eventually, and even through the regression, you will see overall progress.
* To the above point: Don't conflate the concepts of cure and treatment. BPD has no cure, but BPD is treatable. It is immensely treatable, and the science shows that people with BPD who get treatment have an overwhelmingly positive prognosis. A huge majority of people with BPD reach remission, and a majority of those stay in remission.

It is okay not to be okay right now. But you are going to be okay. If your family is being unsupportive, a place to start may be learning as much as you can about BPD (and the good shit, not the oversimplified stigmatized crap), and then educating your family. Hopefully they will come around. But even if they don't, places like this are where we can find that acceptance.

If you'd like some good resources both on BPD and resources for those who have loved ones with BPD, or if you need someone to talk to, don't hesitate to DM me. :) There is absolutely nothing shameful about asking for help or support.

1ci2h0w,"Others have made so many helpful comments that I agree with.  

I have BPD and have been in remission for several years.  My family is about as considerate as yours, it sounds like.  There is a theory that BPD and complex post-traumatic stress disorder are the same thing.  CPTSD is often caused by toxic, abusive families.  I don' t know if that's the case with your family or not.

It's tempting to share our weaknesses and vulnerabilities with our families and hope they'll  empathize and provide emotional support.  If your family members aren't the type to offer such support, you can't change that.  If they're like mine, sharing with them just invites more abuse.

Please know that there actually are people in the world who are kind, supportive, and empathetic.  Those of us with BPD, though, often require more emotional support than most people can provide.  We have to learn to self-soothe, and to regulate our emotions.  Once we can do that we're basically in remission.  I was in my late 40s before I was able to do those things and lost a lot of relationships along the way.  Losing relationships is really painful for us.

You can get better.  Do the work. Do the cognitive/dialectical behavioral therapy.  Meds can help you regulate yourself while you learn new skills, but they won't cure BPD or even put you in remission.  Only doing the work (steadily, often for years) can lead to remission.

1chxpo9,"You assert your boundaries and realize that you are not responsible for her hurt. It's important that you get to be you, regardless of how that makes her feel. Live your life, stand firm, make choices you are proud of and can stand up for, and keep calm and emotionally grounded when confronted with situations or feelings that may seem out of place for you. Don't invalidate her feelings, but don't sacrifice your sense of self any longer. 

Be sorry for her that she has to deal with these intense emotions, but don't be sorry for doing something normal or good for you, even if that's what caused it. Unfortunately the best way to heal from triggers is to be confronted with them.

Take an imaginary situation here for instance: you talk with a platonic female friend, catch up, and have a good time. This person is a friend to you and you provide each other emotional support, and have fun hanging out, both knowing that you are not romantically interested in each other. 

She might feel threatened, her abandonment trauma might act up, and that fucking sucks for her. This doesn't mean that you need to change, and see your friend less and less, because then you lose part of yourself - the self that she fell in love with in the first place. Instead you talk with her, reassure her, and show that you care about how it makes her feel, by making her feel extra special in some way. Like sure you went for coffee with your friend and had a good time, but that's nothing compared to spending a lovely evening with your wife in a nice restaurant, watching the sunset by the beach together, and then having sex like it's the first time again. You can tell her these things, instead of just being frustrated that she is upset at you for living your life.

Try not to be frustrated or upset, because her feelings are valid. She has trauma responses, and you can gently help her guide herself into handling it better.

I guess what I‚Äôm saying is being fixated on a diagnosis is potentially a BPD symptom in itself and if you were diagnosed then what do you hope to gain? Just bettering your mental health and administering self therapy might be a better option until you reach adulthood and can seek professional help.

1chwuju,"That your mom not at all seems conserned about you is a major red flag hinting at neglected. I can tell you a little bit abt my exprience getting diagnosed bcs like you say at first no one belived me or listend to me at all. It was very frustrating. First of all you know yourself best. If you feel like you have a certain disorder go to a doctor taht speciallizes on BPD or PDs in general. This is probably difficult for you since youre 16 therefor cant decide for yourself yet. For me everything changed since i moved out. Before that i was a slave to my family. When i moved out i did everything in my power to make myself heared. And it worked i got diagnosed despite multiple people telling me i cant have it since im a Men. Getting the right diagnosis, even if it isnt bpd, is crucial. You need the right kind of therapeutic process to recover. Which isn't possible if your misdiagnosed. Also i advice you to always view your feelings/expriences as valid. No matter how intense they get. They are always valid, but not always helpful. Your experience is valid. It seems like you're in a invalidating environment. Thats why its absolutely crucial to give yourself what others can't give you. Just tell yourself ""its ok that i feel X or Y i even know why i feel this way..."". Keep pushing for the right diagnosis. I view it as a cry for help. I dont think the enviorment you are in is helpful to your development at all. Maybe you feel very lost and search for a reason why nothing seems to work out or everything is so weird. Hang in there. This might sound insane to you but your mom isnt the nicest person she seems to be majorly neglecting your emotional needs. Telling your child you don't take it serious is just ridiculous. You can question what your mom says in your head by thinking: would I say that to my kid? If the answer is no you're in for trouble. I only was able to discorvered that i have been abused for all of my life by the age of 19. You still have time to search for help. Again your feelings and Expriences are valid! (this is highly personaly and might not relfect your situation btw but if you look up the term ""gaslighting"" maybe some things might make sense. If it makes sense you're not alone! there is help! if you want you can msg me)

 I wish you the best of luck, thankfully im 21 and have that behind me already, i wouldn't want to do it again. But speaking from experience, I know the truth is out there.

I can tell you that being labeled doesn‚Äôt really help anything since the symptoms themselves are what we are taught to tackle. In fact the label can hinder our growth for a few years because it forces us to accept that we in fact have a disorder which is not easy to accept at all.

1chwck0,"Yes it IS your BPD telling you that you're not good enough.  It might be true that you're ""too much,"" if you have BPD.  Those of us with BPD can definitely be too much.  Just remember - even if you can't control your internal thoughts and emotions, you CAN control your external behaviors. We absolutely must self regulate. Constantly asking for or demanding reassurance is too much for most people. Getting jealous, needing constant attention, being dramatic - all can be too much.  It's not that you need to isolate yourself permanently though - that's black and white thinking there.

Self regulation is so difficult....constantly asking ourselves ""well how much is too much? How much is not enough?""

What I've been doing might seem silly but it has been working for me.  I pay attention to how long it takes the other person to respond, and that's how often I take to respond to their messages.   I don't text more than they do.  I'm dating a guy now.  At first if he texted 2 sentences, I texted 2 sentences.   If he took 2 hours to answer my text, I took 2 hours to answer his.  I always waited for him to text first in the morning until he mentioned that sometimes he waits to see if I text first, to make sure I'm still interested - then I took that as a cue to start texting him first about half the time.  I waited for him to start hinting that he wanted to be exclusive and then clarified.....""so if I'm hearing you right, you're saying you want to be exlusive?""  Waited for him to confirm....""OK, then. Let's give it a try and see how it works.  Let's give it 3 months of being exclusive and then see if we are still in agreement on that.""

I haven't stopped letting him lead on how much we text and call.  I initiate about half the time.  If it takes him a long time to get back with me - I find other things to do and think about.  We can't be the center of each other's worlds.  We both have lives of our own and that is normal and healthy, not a sign of rejection.

I was very careful to pick an emotionally mature and stable person, not another person with BPD, and followed his lead.  I know he's not perfect and it made me nervous and happy at the same time when I learned he was driving past my house sometimes, checking up on me sometimes.  I don't drive paste his house or check on him, though. I like keeping it so he's more emotionally intense than me, at least on the outside. It keeps me from being ""too much.""

It's not difficult for me to do this because I'm in remission with my BPD.  I know it's a lot harder for people who aren't in remission yet but I think it's one of many good strategies to learn to self regulate.  If we can find emotionally mature and stable people to be with, we can learn a lot from them.  And if we take other people's lead, then we won't be ""too much.""

It's not that there's anything wrong with us.  We feel deeply.  It's just that other people don't feel as deeply, don't experience things as dramatically - and they get a little intimidated by our intense emotions.  We have to learn to keep our emotions in check so other people feel comfortable and safe.  We have to accept that our emotions are ours to deal with, and not ask other people to deal with them for us.  It's hard but possible.",Academic-Anything-89,False,1714705124.0

 I was here asking about my ex partner in hopes of understanding what I could do to try to make that work. Mainly for her to help herself. After all that time, I still don't know which of the different hers was her, the horrible. Insolent 16 year old, the 43 year old who I only spoke to, really,  twice, (she's 43) the depressed glazed over her, the little 4 year old girl her, or the abusing 43 woman. 


The fake her, as they are talking about here, is the outside persona. The character that is the chameleon.  That who I knew for months before we got together. She dissapeard after a couple of weeks from our world. She'd only pop up when we went to a show where my freind were, and when she was buttering up for a ""triangle"" (when she deliberately went out to flirt and pick up another guy in front of me  to show me I was replaceable, and to stop me from leaving). The fake bpd is kind of, I guess, a more chameleon like, essentially kind of  manipulative/ survival mode/ acceptable for human consumption character people know.

It can be easy to confuse a family member who is simply stressed out with anxiety disorders, who  act  inappropriately towards you to make you think bpd. But, if you're here on this page, who've seen some inexplicable stuff in someone. 

In my response, my example, she had, I assume, been reprimanded at work for being insolent that day,  the 16 year old girl; she had detached into the little girl, mentally blacked out and texted me that night. The little girl would repeat words like that: "" Sometimes i do goid at work, sometimes i do bad at work, etc. She never remembered the little girl. That's when I thought something bad happened to he,  which caused the borderline illness. Which is the hardest part to leave comes into play. It's a real trauma. Very serious. And I still that that seriously, and i hope she may have tried to seek out therapy since then. 
Then the 16 year old blasted me when I asked about the weed thing. 

Truth is, the real bpd inside, I never had a problem with, the 43 year old with intense concerns, but she was very rare to turn up. 

She insolent one, the 16 year old, she remembered her somewhat more, but the realist 43 year her I knew, dodged my questions of clarification of the 16 year old's behaviour after.

Truth is, I think she knew she went there a lot, but she couldn't explain or justify the actions of the 16 year old, even to herself. So that wasn't the real her as far as I feel. 

A psychologist who treats bpd will able to speak to you, and he/ she will be able to tell you within a session if the person you suspect has bpd. Just from little stories like I gave. 

I'm seeing a clinical psychologist who treats bpd to try and heal me after that relationship. But also, just about myself, to improve my own past.

She's homing in on my mother's brother very much. I think she's looking for the person who set off the chain of events that helped form me. I think she suspects bpd in him. 

He affected me mother greatly now that I'm talking to my mother about him. 

This stuff he did that I never knew, my God. I mean, we lived in rentals for most of my young life, now I found out, because those woman who were ringing me at 10, asking where he is, that he owes them $1600, $20,000 etc. We had to sell our real house to pay some of them back. Apparently he harrased my mom about this. His manipulation abilities must have been of the wall.

So right off the bat I‚Äôd say prepare to be annoyed. And yes, I know people thought they were helping but when you‚Äôre trying to quit a substance due to the way it negatively impacts you (BPD or no), suggesting continuing to do the substance is not actually helpful. My dad is a (now sober) alcoholic and I wouldn‚Äôt suggest he only drink beer or tell him how helpful a glass of wine is for me when I need to wind down. It‚Äôs just common courtesy. Anyways, just warning you.

Quitting has been pretty difficult for me. It‚Äôs been a couple of months. I used to bring me into the present moment and to stop spiraling/relax. It is really helpful for me. It has been awful quitting, but I had to as it became a problem. The present moment is not very happy for me right now and I actually began obsessing over my current problems/depression to the point that my suicidal ideation was at an all time high‚Äî specifically when I was smoking. I actually almost bought the supplies (canceled the order after I placed it) one evening about thirty minutes after smoking. I just couldn‚Äôt risk it, for my safety and for my family, whom I told I would not kill myself.

I miss smoking terribly as it brought out my creativity. A lot of my old pursuits feel boring now. I‚Äôve been told it takes time for the brain to adjust (I was a daily smoker) its naturally occurring dopamine levels after quitting, but I haven‚Äôt really experienced that yet. I even started back on meds (Wellbutrin, specifically) but the boredom persists.

If it helps at all, the post I made had a lot of people commiserating. I think I deleted it (I tend to delete old posts), but regardless of that I know real-time dialogue can be helpful too. 

Agree with the other commenter about just quitting cold turkey. That‚Äôs what I did. I still have some in the house and every time I want to smoke again I try to remember that using a substance to cope is ultimately not where I want to be .. and also, there‚Äôs the suicidal ideation.

Here to chat more about this if you‚Äôd like. Good luck, you got this. Keep your head up, deal with the boredom, and try to keep yourself busy.

1. You are aware of your situation
2. You are posting it to get some insights 

As a fellow person with bpd and substance abuse issues, what really helped me was the intent..
At one point after smoking for years, I got very tired, had frequent breakdowns, regular triggers, anger got up, depression increased, was unfocused and saturated, used to binge shows and was basically not living my reality..
I will not give you some speech or some deep shit knowledge but just let something motivate your intent to reduce the substance use. It is very difficult, I know, I used to fall back into the loop as well(whenever I thought I WILL QUIT) But the reality that I accepted about myself was that I don't really want to quit it, I asked myself what common ground I can achieve here..I used it only once or twice a month. It gave me a sense that this is meant to be enjoyed and not to be abused. 
I knew that I will still have multiple triggers during these days when I'm not using substance.. That's where different psychological strategies helped me, very primitive.. 4-4-4 rule, 5,4,3,2,1 exercise, meditation at times, practicing taking space in a situation where I knew I'd lose it, practicing multiple hobbies when I had the urge to use again, indulging in spirituality, diving into inner self and self reflection.. it took sometime, some efforts, dedication but it is very much worth it. 
I do have my breakdowns now, but I know for a fact that I don't need to rely on substance anymore. I will not let myself be afraid of my demons, I'll head on face them and if not at that point of time, I will come back and face them.
I hope it helps..",ErzaScarlettttt,False,1714726758.0

With concentrates (dabs, tinctures, etc) becoming so popular over the last 5 or so years, TERPENES are what you want to pay attention to.

That must be difficult. 

I've seen a few people experiencing BPD+ADHD, daily life must feel very confusing as well as painful..

But I have learnt that ADHD can be one of your greatest advantage. As someone suffering from both, you might frequently experience self doubt, I do too.. a lot. I wish you find something that soothes you, makes you understand that you're an amazing person and you can be anything you want to be(I know that I don't know you to say that but I trust in what humans are capable of, we need love and compassion for ourselves). There are many people who don't even think about being a great parent, they flow through the time. The thought in itself says a lot about you. You'll do great, don't worry.

I'm sorry there is something that I'll say now that might trigger or can be comprehended in many ways..
I've found that living with BPD is extremely, extremely complicated, you don't trust who you are, you don't stay in touch with reality..and so on.. that's very difficult to live with..but I've understood that we feed off our environment, in a bad setting..I'm a bad person.. in a lonely setting, I'm still a bad person.. in a cooperative setting, I feel I can do more than i thought I could, I'm better than i thought I am..
So this means something right? I can't rely on the setting, hence I need to form that setting in myself. I need to give myself that environment. When my intentions were clear--That I really want to live my life in entirety and not die because of a few traumatic experiences..it came clearer to me..
I fed my brain..with the facts-i am actually an empath, I care for people, I know how to love, I have a few friends(they're here because they love me even though it's difficult for me to love myself all the time), i can be happy regardless of outward forces etc etc..you can feed what and how these things are relevant to you..it may sound like manipulation but BPD is actually all about that, your mind manipulating you to show you as a bad person... being positive about yourself is not being delusional in our case.. we need to be that in case to be truly happy..

Once you check the facts you can then try to see whether how youre feeling reflects what is actually happening/the facts.

1cheqpx,"Your post.... hits hard. Here's a big rant that still affects me to this day and the one reason why I've been struggling so hard with health issues and money problems since:

Before i got fired from working my 2nd preschool job, back on November 3 last year for ""looking too sad"" and for mentioning ""I feel like I need to find a new job"", the day before, I had a 2 week hire evaluation (ended up being 2 months later) with my co-teacher at the same time.

I was waiting for this meeting because I had a lot of things to say about how my co-teacher was and wanted advice. I felt extremely defensive right off the bat because she began talking first and just kept talking. She'd list these things she had problems with about me like how we've had several ""arguments"", which I learned that ""argument"" just meant any type of disagreeing opinion from hers, but there was ONE altercation where i approached her with a question that i worded badly, and she took very offensively and began getting quite loud and disruptive. My two bosses also would say that they didn't like how I was *always* seen doing side work/handiwork like cleaning or little projects or something, while she was always with the kids or doing diapers, or how I moved the classroom around too much and was making an unstable environment for the kids.

I tried to tell them that we've only had one moment that is similar to an argument, and how I recognized I didn't approach the question the right way, but I had not done anything to show I was in an ""argument"". My voice was calm, I constantly apologized and just tried to explain what I meant, and the question was asked ** for the purpose of getting her two cents on it so I can adjust my look on things to better help the classroom dynamic. 
I also tried to say that the diapers situation was because she most often ran to do that immediately when coming in from something like outside, and I had a lot of side things to do. I admit I took on a lot of tasks, but she also kept asking me to do things. Asking me so many things, including moving around the classroom, which she was NOT seen doing because she complained of back pain from bending over since the furniture was tiny.
Also, for side work saying I wasn't spending enough time with the kids, I made up for it by being the MOST interactive with them during ALL exercise times or stressful times. I kept the energy high, kept them distracted, they listened to me MORE, and I created multiple activities for them to get their energy out- also PATRICIPATING in these activities so they stayed interested. All while my coteacher just stood on the side and cheered or watched...
Apparently other teachers were also gossiping about me saying I was shit talking my co-teacher often or we were yelling at each other a lot - but if we were both yelling, only I was at fault??? Also, none these rumors were not true. The only times I'd ever talk about my coteacher was factual information like ""we tried doing that but she didn't like it so we went back to this way"". And the teacher who was with me that last day, said I made her day incredibly hard because I was ""so negative"". Meanwhile, me and her talked and joked all day, and I was doing EVERYTHING my bosses told me they wanted to see from the meeting the day before. 

I tried to explain all these things and how I was doing most of them under DIRECTION, but I never got to fully explain myself because I ""took too long"" as they said. So they listed to my co-teacher because she listed all her complaints within 2 sentences each, and I took too long trying to say ""I couldn't do A because she told me B and when I tried doing this, she asked me to do C"".

I began to get extremely frustrated and it was clearly showing on me. I kept saying I was frustrated because I wasn't feeling like I was getting a chance to fully explain myself because I kept getting cut off - which was true. Not only did my co-teacher constantly interrupt me when I'd be trying to defend myself or talk about what she's doing that's unfavorable (which could then redirect the whole conversation to her side and I'd be done), but my two bosses would interrupt me saying ""well she said she did this so that doesn't line up"".... they basically didn't take my word for anything because she SPOKE BEFORE ME.

At that point, I basically became a broken record. Kept repeating how I wasn't able to speak, they'd interrupt me and say how I've been speaking a lot. It had been almost an hour of that meeting and I was supposed to leave work when the meeting started because I had a 2nd job to go to - which I ended up being over 30 minutes late for. I left, completely broken and confused, got home 5 hours later and broke down crying. Began job browsing and had 0 sleep that night due to a migraine from stress and crying, and the next day, another teacher in my class age group asked how the meeting went, and I said ""not well. I didn't feel supported at all. I feel like I have to find a new job"".

1cha8yx,"I really feel you on this. My MDD has been bad for the past seven or so months and it's bringing out the worst of my BPD, threatening to undermine all the progress I've made these past few years in therapy.

My therapist finally convinced me to go on an antidepressant (bupropion) and I definitely started to feel better/have more interest in life, but unfortunately the drug had some pretty severe side effects and I had to stop taking it within a couple weeks. I'm not sure I'll get on another one since I specifically wanted to avoid the side effects of SSRIs and bupropion is different.

The main thing (before meds) that helped me though, was trying to think through and specifically identify the area(s) of my life that were making me feel depressed, isolate them, and convince myself that they would get better and that all the other stuff was good.

I'm not gonna lie though. It's all much easier said than done and I find myself almost dreading my MDD more than my BPD these days. When my BPD shows up and I start getting clingy with my gf or splitting on a friend, I'm like, ""Oh, it's you"" like a character would greet an archvillain in a TV show or movie. Bad, but you know their tricks. A lot of times I can even ""talk"" my BPD down, like I'm doing diplomacy with myself.

But depression feels like a sea monster that you just can't reason with. Depression doesn't care if I convince it I'm not going to get abandoned. It just doesn't care about anything. It doesn't feel like it knows what it wants (unlike my BPD, which very clearly wants romantic and friendship connections to fill the void).

If your sister is self-aware or has personal insight it may help to ask her what how she wants you to respond when shes upset,  what things to say, etc. Have this conversation when shes NOT dysregulated so you can get her insight.

If your sister wouldnt be responsive to that type of convo or suggests things you just cant do (eg. ""Always answer when I call"") then you could instead try the ""SET"" approach. Outlined here: https://medium.com/@fracturedlight/talking-bpd-7553424b7f6a 

Pretty much you want to validate her, express your care for her, but also hold your boundaries and be realistic when its called for. 

Holding firm boundaries with empathy: If you cant do something, try to verbalise that your care for her but cant do xx because yy. Proposing an alternative can also help (be as specific as possible with this so expectations are understood by both parties).
Eg. ""I really care about you sis, but Im in a meeting with my CEO right now so I cant answer your calls. Ill call you when I finish work at 5pm and we can talk then. I hope youre going okay.""
""I really care about you and want to support you but I cant keep talking with you if you keep calling me names. Im going to go (esp. If youve given her a couple warnings to stop and she hasnt) now, but Ill check in again this evening. Can you try taking a hot shower to help you feel better instead?"" 

Most importantly STICK TO your boundaries! Have set responses for boundary pushing. Eg. If she spams you either dont respond or have a set response (eg. ""I care about you but I cant keep talking about this rn"" or ""if you keep messaging me these aggressive messages Ill need to block you until tonight"" and then follow through). If she threatens suicide and youre genuinely concerned, do something to ensure her safety while also maintaining your boundary (eg. Redirect her to a hotline, get police to do a welfare check). Its important to hold boundaries because if she learns a certain behaviour (eg. Spamming you) gets her what she wants (eg. Attention, care)  then youre just reinforcing that behaviour and she'll do it more (coz subconsciously she knows it works). 

Quick validation 101 lesson - validation can seem tricky when what theyre saying is ""unresonable"", but you can validate their feelings rather than their beliefs. Dont validate anything which isnt valid. But know that all feelings have a cause (even if that cause is assumptions and misinterpretations). If in doubt, focus on validating just their feelings. This can be done by reflecting what youve heard/observed (eg. ""I can see youre feeling really xxxx"") or identifying the emotion and cause to link them into making sense( eg.  ""It makes sense you feel so upset given you feel like nothing ever goes right for you"") - the validation isnt about agreeing ""yeah nothing goes right for you"" its about understanding she feels bad for a reason, even if that reason is made up in her head, and that her feelings make sense when you consider that reason.",Awesomesauce250,False,1714546219.0

I appreciate you taking the time to write all that out. 

Just to touch on the suicide thing- I have suggested that she call a hotline and her therapist when she makes threats like this. she always says that her therapist has fired her (she goes through a lot of therapists) or that they don‚Äôt care And then says that suicide hotline are useless and make her want to kill herself. She also says it is so messed up for me to tell her to talk to a stranger instead of her sister and obviously I don‚Äôt love her. 
I‚Äôve called suicide hotline myself to talk about her and try to get some advice. 

A few years ago, she threatens suicide to my mom and myself and then would not answer the phone so we did do a welfare check on her. She was about three hours away so we had to call the police and it did not go well. They showed up at her door and she had been smoking weed and accused us of trying to get her arrested and have permanent stuff on her record. She‚Äôs about to be in nursing school and says if we do that again, we will destroy her chances of being a nurse. The obvious answer to me is OK don‚Äôt threaten suicide then because I love you and if I can‚Äôt check on you myself, I will get someone who can. But it does not seem to stop her. 
It‚Äôs really hard because our dad committed suicide so it‚Äôs definitely a trigger for everyone involved.",ss1325,True,1714576519.0
1ch2c15,"No worries! Im glad I could help. :)

The suicide stuff is really tricky coz obviously you want to make sure shes safe. But at the same time you CANT let her use suicide threats as a way to break your boundaries. Think about it - if you say ""I need space"" and you ignore her until she says ""im gonna kill myself coz you dont love me"" and THEN you respond and show love/care...then next time when you start ignoring her she'll likely pull the suicide card quicker coz she knows it works. This is most likely subconscious for her, but its still conditioning her to be extreme in order to get her needs met.

Suicide hotlines can be unhelpful, but some are better than others. Its not messed up for you to hold your boundaries and refer her to a professional who has training in mental health - its pretty logical and caring really. But also understand that from her perspective it feels like rejection, and that really hurts. 

You need to do what youre comfortable with to ensure her safety. Im pretty sure having a welfare check or even being admitted to hospital for mental health wont stop her being a nurse - if you think thats a genuine concern do some research about the rules in your area.
If she really hates the hotline suggestion, I would recommend telling her to go to hospital, talk to a different loved one who may have more capacity atm or getting police (or someone else?) to do a welfare check. Keep your boundary! For a welfare check, perhaps let her know its happening. Something like ""I really care about you (her name), and Im concerned about your safety because youve said youre going to kill yourself. Im going to call a welfare check so I can make sure youre okay."" -- this communicates you care, holds your boundary and also communicates that its because of her threats that youre doing this. After sending that you need to not get drawn back into re-engaging/conversation. If youve hit the point where you need a break or cant talk rn, stick to it. Follow through with what you say youll do (welfare check, getting another person to check on her etc). And if she keeps trying to get you to engage (eg. Continues threatening suicide, says you dont love her etc) be compassionate but stick to what youve already said. Be a broken record. Dont give her any extra ""attention"" for her threats. Either ignore her (and do welfare check etc) or if you want repeat what youve said (but shorter) eg. ""I really care aboutbyou/love you so Im calling/have called the welfare check. I cant keep talking rn"". Or ""I care about you but I cant keep talking rn"" (and then escalate like I outlined in my first comment if needed). 

Youre right that the obvious answer is for her to not threaten suicide. *saying* that to her wont make it stop though. You have to *show* her that threatening suicide doesnt get her what she wants (ie. Extra care and attention, you not leaving the convo, etc). If you consistently show her it doesnt ""work"" she'll likely stop, or at least stop spamming you about it. She may feel betrayed or say hurtful things about you when you call the welfare check, trust that youre doing whats best for both of you. 

A brief consideration though - it may get worse before it gets better. Shes learnt (subconsciously) that escalating her behaviour gets her needs met. So when it stops working (you holding boundaries) she'll likely escalate MORE to try to get it to work. YOU NEED TO STILL HOLD YOUR BOUNDARY! Itll take persistence from you before you see an improvement. A welfare check or letting another friend know can be a good way to make her safe without breaking your boundary. 

By all means make sure shes safe but do so in  a way which is not breaking your boundaries. If you let her break your boundaries you are hurting yourself but youre also teaching her bad patterns and hurting her ability to heal/improve.

For therapists - ive gone through a few too. Its pretty common when youve got fear of abandonment, low trust and find being vulnerable scary. With her next psych encourage her to bring this issue up with them in the first/second session. The psych can then talk to her about ways to manage it (eg. With my psych we're booking a few appointments at a time because if im triggered and have no upcoming appointments Ill just not rebook). Its not an uncommon problem so a good psych should be prepared to problem solve it with her. :)

Im sorry about your dad. :( That would make this extra hard. Remember you can keep her safe without caving to her demands. <3",Awesomesauce250,False,1714607185.0

If you cant get professional help Id recommend:
1. Looking into dbt yourself and trying to learn one new skill each week (practicing that skill throughout the week before moving to the next one, gradually stacking all of the skills into your life).

2. Focus on basic selfcare. Ie. Good sleep routine, treating physical illness (eg. Take medication for conditions you have), exercise regularly, eat a nutritious diet, avoid alcohol/drugs. It wont fix your problems, but it stops them from being worse than they need to be.

3. Start tracking your mood. Identify what sets you off when you impulsively spend/get mood swings (what are you feeling beforehand, whats going on in your life at the time- such as stressors, what were you doing when it happened). This will help identify patterns so you can start building awareness and resilience to your triggers.

1cflmca,"Sorry in advance for the long comment, lol!! I've done 2 DBT skills groups, an addictions DBT skills group, and just got signed up for another one at the end of May. DBT was a gamechanger for me!!! There's a massive difference in my journal entries from before and after my first group. If you can't find an option in your price range, I know a few people who have just bought the DBT workbook and started going through it themselves! There also might be organizations in your area that offer free or low-cost dbt groups. If you Google something like ""(cheap/affordable/sliding scale/free) DBT near me"" you might find some less expensive options. 


If the clinic you go to uses the Abstinence-only approach, it makes sense that they'd require sobriety. I'm not a big fan of that model of treatment but it's pretty common still. If you have a choice about what clinic/program you go to, you might be able to find one that uses a harm reduction model, in which case they typically just require that you don't come to sessions while under the influence or something along those lines. Most places will either have their substance/sobriety policies available on their websites or by request over the phone/email! 


Depending on the substance(s) you use, the request for sobriety could also be related to medication - one psychiatrist I saw (once lol) wouldn't even assess me for adhd until I had been sober from weed for 6+ months. Maybe they're just being weird about making sure your system is fully clear from substances before prescribing anything so they can observe how you respond without potential interference. Either way, it would definitely be a good idea to ask your psychiatrist for clarification, as well as make sure you know the substance use policy for any group you do end up enrolling in! 


My biggest tip is to approach the group with open-mindedness and willingness! It's going to feel silly, stupid, pointless, uncomfortable, even triggering at times, but its so worth it to do as much of it as you can anyway! All of those experiences are valuable and they mean you're doing it right. Even if you try a skill and hate it, or end up forgetting/avoiding a skill, it's still more self knowledge that you might not have had before! The only way you can really do it incorrectly is by not trying!!! 


I hope you're able to find an option that works for you!!! It has really changed my life. If you have any other questions lmk! I'm not an expert by any stretch but I'm happy to share my experiences. Best of luck to you!!! üíñ",atguwt,False,1714430667.0

The narcissist and the bpd are often drawn to each other. You enter a false relationship to share an illusion of wholeness. 

This sense of wholeness is predicated on an illusion, and the narcissist will be able to make you his caretaker. His sense self is split in 2 halves: complete superiority, founded upon a self delluion that is fairly unshakeable.  This creates the illusion that you are safe that he is unbreakable and you are free of your bpd tendencies. 

The 2nd half is empty. Nothing. No identity. 

If he is a narcissist,  in time, this facade will shatter with the bpd individual.  Leaving a hollow shell of a man. 

Then you will have nothing but a broken man, which will make you look elsewhere. He will lash out at you to try to regain dominance, to no avail. I've seen this. It's ugly. 

If your partner is a normal man, he may have had a bad relationship with a bpd partner, and he may be trying to see if he can handle the situation, and will become hurt.

1cfhddv,"I could have written this exact same post 2 years ago. Almost the same exact situation. DBT helps - sure. But using those skills while enduring the intense highs and lows that is the fun of enjoying a potential new relationship is definitely difficult to calm down, so I totally understand. Depending on how safe and willing to be upfront with this person I would recommend vocalizing the intensity of your feelings and that you want to try to control your impulsivity a bit by taking things slow. Space out interactions, pace yourself by reorienting some of the energy you use towards them towards things you want to catch up on for yourself, don't forget to hang out with other friends who also care about you so you don't get swallowed into the obsession with the current one and only. The right person would be willing to hear you out and understand. And while trying to manage that impulsive desire to just throw total wifey-girlfriend material behavior at them, I would suggest redirecting some of that energy into filling yourself up with good ol' self care experiences when spacing out your interactions. Remember that you don't have to have someone to be whole and feel good, and work towards filling your own time with something fun you enjoy to feel a bit more comfortable in your own company. I personally like going to plant shops, journaling, going outside for a walk, or just driving to a pretty spot to watch sunsets with good music. Everyone is different so do whatever is fun for you! I know it's hard and can feel addicting, but reinforcing your independence outside of relationships will only help you and your future relationships with partners to be more fulfilling.

Medication does work. There are sooo many medical professionals (especially here in the UK) that say bpd cannot be managed with meds. It‚Äôs bullshit. Meds absolutely can help, but finding the right ones can be a perilous journey. I currently take four different medications to keep my mental health issues under control. I will however add, I have lots of other mental health issues that affect me more than bpd does. I do believe that this is something that many of us in this community experience. Bpd almost always comes along with other issues. 


Sleep hygiene and routine is absolutely fucking essential, without a good routine and a safe sleep space, all of the above become impossible. 

Lastly, treat yourself with kindness. You aren‚Äôt bpd, you just happen to be a person *with* bpd, and you deserve as much kindness and love as anyone else. You are worthy of self love, and you deserve it, endlessly.

1cfgofl,"I would most definitely look into getting an SSRI if you suffer from depression as well as BPD. It took me a few tries to figure out what depression medication worked for me, but I ended up landing on Sertraline. I‚Äôm looking into getting on a mood stabilizer as well. Get a psychiatrist and work with them on getting you on medication that‚Äôs right for you. No medication works the same for every person, and you may have to cycle through several medications before finding one that works. I went through two different SSRI‚Äôs before landing on sertraline and both of them affected me differently. 

DBT and talk therapy are great forms of therapy to look into. Depending upon what kind of BPD you have, CBT could be more harmful than helpful. I know CBT doesn‚Äôt work for me at all because I‚Äôm so tender hearted and sensitive. It‚Äôs a harsher form of therapy, and I don‚Äôt do well with that. You can look up BPD symptoms and coping mechanisms online as well. I‚Äôve found this Subreddit and BPD TikTok to be very informative. I also went on a rabbit hole through YouTube watching interviews with a BPD specialist and that helped me a lot. 

The most important thing about maintaining a relationship with BPD is to be completely open about your feelings with your partner. You have to communicate your needs, otherwise they won‚Äôt know how to help you. It‚Äôs a lot of, ‚ÄúIt hurt me when you did this, do you think you can do this instead to help me out?‚Äù. 

My BPD has caused far too many arguments between me and my husband over the past 10 years, as I was just recently diagnosed as well. One thing we made sure of was to never go to bed angry. We‚Äôve realized over these years that most of our arguments stem from miscommunication because we‚Äôre both very emotional individuals.

She had gotten into DBT therapy about 2 years ago and although she was still struggling, she was making so much improvement and having so much growth within therapy and otherwise. My Niece had just turned 23 on March 5th before she died and I told her often as I myself have been in trauma therapy for 3 years that in time things can improve especially while you are receiving help. Medication can sometimes be a bust. I have anxiety depression CPTSD and ADHD and I have been on so many different medications to the point I just stopped all together. Trauma therapy is the only thing this far that has been worth putting my effort into and as I was very close with my niece I can tell you she would express this to you as well. You might always suffer with having huge feelings and sometimes be unmotivated but the episodes aren‚Äôt as frequent and tend to not uproot your life quite as much. Also as I said before you are so young and with time you will learn and grow and learn newer and healthier coping mechanisms. If no one else says this to you, I believe in you.

We can‚Äôt control the emotions but we can‚Äôt control what we do with them. 

How willing is it to work on himself and admit he‚Äôs the problem? When I split I was told to get in the shower and put the water on hot and cold and keep switching. It helps turn the black and white thinking into something more grey. It works for me, Is he willing to find a coping mechanism that works for him?

When your husband is calm and not in an episode you talk to him about an action plan. Can he recognize the first signs before he splits and remove himself from the situation?

1cetf07,"I am going through a splitting episode with my husband now too, they were better for a few months and then have started to get closer and closer together again. Change and stress seems to trigger them. I know exactly how you're feeling and it's so hard. 


The only thing that helped get us out of our first bad cycle was honestly him realizing that I would leave. After splitting me and telling me how horrible I treated him by not giving him enough attention, and saying that we shouldn't be together, instead of fighting it I just said ""ok."" It wasn't in an angry way, and he went along with it for a couple weeks before realizing that it was real, and broke down and understood he had a huge part to play in us being unhappy. I made sure to say that I wish it didn't come to that, and that I am willing to support him but not under the conditions of being emotionally abused so that it wasn't perceived as me abandoning him. You have to be careful that they don't just paint you all bad. We had a good 6 months of being able to keep explosive things in check (a couple hiccups but all in all growing) so I do have hope that we can get back there. I think there just wasn't enough done in that time to gather enough tools to help when things got stressful, and we do have a lot of stress right now. 

But as far as dealing with the splitting when it happens, one thing I've recently realized (I'll go back and forth between having educated reactions to his episodes to emotional ones, so I'm back to re-learning the educated reactions) is that ANY perceived slight against them will be used against you. Even if they say, ""tell me I'm doing it and I'll know to stop."", I don't think they realize the extent that they perceive everything as accusations, they are not in their normal rational mind. And they will only see that you accused them. The less you say, the quicker they realize it was only their actions that caused the drama, they have less to deflect to. I also found completely shutting down their conflict seeking behavior with ""I love you, but we'll have to talk about this later when we're feeling a little calmer"" and not engaging at all with accusations is the best route. One time he was trying to fight with me and had the splitting look in his eyes and he said, ""guess what I'm feeling about you."" And I said, ""aww, I love you too"". That honestly shut him up for the night. Part of splitting I've learned is wanting to have you validate their intense rage for you by fighting with them and proving them right, so they'll keep pushing to get you to do it. It's very very exhausting and not something you should live with, but getting through a few in a calm way may bring you to a place where he finally just sees it's his BPD causing the conflict, not you. 

Also happy birthday! Something about the pressure of birthdays always threw my partner into a particularly bad episode, I think their guilt and shame gets the best of them and unfortunately it's when you want their love the most :( I started prepping with looking forward to doing ""nothing at all"" and having NO pressure around bdays or holidays and it made them a lot better.",FantasticVariety5287,False,1714308390.0
1cetf07,"I'm sorry you're going through this.

One thing that is really, really important in being with someone with BPD is that you have to have boundaries, and you ***have*** to enforce them, even if they are loved ones. It often times takes those of us with BPD getting rejected enough times by breaking rules set for us to recognize we need to get help. 

Enabling his behavior by not following through on boundaries or ultimatums is a roundabout way of telling him that he can act however he wants and get away with it. While it's important to show compassion and patience with him (and you're doing that), you can't exactly help someone when you yourself are at wits end. His BPD is an explanation for his behavior, but not an excuse. He is responsible for getting the help and doing the work, and you can't make him do it. If he doesn't want to accept his part of the problem, then it's best you prioritize yourself. I'm not saying you have to leave immediately. But if he is failing to meet your ultimatum, then ***you*** need to meet your ultimatum. 

As for what is going on: your husband's brain, due to genetics and/or early childhood neglect, did not properly develop the standard systems for emotional regulation. And he did not have the resources to learn how to adapt and cope with this handicap. The mix of a brain incapable of regulation emotions + trauma related to neglect and abandonment, and the lack of coping skills, have created his volatile behavior like splitting. But this being said, I need to stress again that he is responsible for understanding his situation and developing the self awareness and coping skills to reduce his splitting and/or learn to handle them in less harmful ways. That is only something he can learn through things like therapy. 

This is not your fault, and this may not be his fault entirely either, but it is 100% his responsibility. Demand the respect you deserve, or send him on his way. He will not change unless he actually commits to the work it takes.",princefruit,False,1714324090.0

One thing that I found out early on is that ""walking on eggshells"" can only go so far.  I kept shrinking inside myself more and more to avoid triggering him.  We went together to a mental health clinic where he got the BPD diagnosis, and I felt like there were finally answers.

And we do harmful-to-others BPD shit at regular intervals.

If there's a mitigating factor, it's that we care about the harm we do to others - which we do only when triggered (even when triggered irrationally and unjustifiably, unfortunately).

Anything and everything we can do to desensitize our triggers is our entire strategy for coping and recovery. It's literally the basis for every available treatment.

We experience ""abandonment"" (a life-ending situation in childhood or an ostracization in tribal times) when the real situation is merely that someone close is leaving our lives in the same way lots of people leave people's lives every day. We experience something mundane and survivable as dramatically life-threatening.

If he didn't have a mental illness would accept this behaviour? I often see people use it to avoid accountability. It's not, especially when he seems to be able to access good mental health resources to recover and support him to change. Just because change is difficult doesn't justify emotionally cheating on someone you married. Even if it triggers someones fear of abandonment, emotionally cheating isn't an appropriate or healthy reaction.

On the emotional cheating: 
Also the phone calls to Ireland, how sketchy the friend is about it? Reading that made my heart sink, because why is he trying to cover it up so hard. Reminds me of when my partner started seeing someone else and hiding it despite my discomfort until they slept together 2 hours after we broke up. 

Don't drag yourself down for someone else. Let him sink, if he insists on doing so

Relief comes from therapies (drugs and EMDR/DBT) that desensitize us. In a world where insensitive and mildly delusional people succeed above all others, hypersensitivity like ours is about as maladaptive as possible. 

For me, duloxetine and EMDR help desensitize me, along with the idea that none of my partners want anything worse than an ice cream sundae that they enjoy without me - something that is totally their right and that I support. 

Everything that feels like life or death to us? That's our emotions lying to us - not out of malice, but rather because we're hyper protective against a death threat (abandonment) that isn't real for adults.

1ced63x,"So for the diagnosis, it was that a lot of the results of BPD are the same as autism, for example, social isolation, masking, miscommunications, anxiety over social interactions, etc, but the reasons for them are different. For example, the miscommunications were from being tuned in way too much to subtle social queues and misreading them, rather than not being able to pick up on them. The isolation was more due to black and white thinking and splitting than just not having an intuitive understanding of social situation in any given moment. There were also episodes which are indescribable from autistic meltdowns on those tests.

Those were all things that were discernible by the neuroscientist who did my diagnosis and also the person who did my specific testing for ADHD and autism. Interesting enough, I have trouble paying attention and always thought I had ADHD, and had actually been prescribed Adderall in the past, but did not meet the standard for ADHD when doing actual testing. I actually scored ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù on the tests for attention. They also did things like monitor my eye contact and do tests with imagination and things like that.

I‚Äôm not nearly as bad as I used to be, but I still struggle to hold my tongue. Before, when I split, I would bring your dead mom into it, tell you you‚Äôre a waste of space, or describe all the ways in which you were unintelligent; whoever it was that I was splitting on- since I‚Äôm extremely insightful and can peg a person the moment I meet them- I would know exactly where to hit that hurts the person I‚Äôm splitting on the most and I would DIG into it until that person was on the verge of a mental breakdown or suicide and I would enjoy it. Of course, afterward I would regret it and eat myself alive for the pain I caused, but that never made up for the fact of how badly I hurt people. 

I still split on people, and I still want them to hurt as badly as they hurt me while I‚Äôm splitting, but I have more control over what I say.

When I split on people its usually when I first meet them and when I meet people I usually carefully just observe who they are based on how they talk, walk, and interactions. I try to be compassionate for the people that have traits that I dont like. When I split black on someone though, its usually when I feel mistreated by them dispite my efforts to be kind, and it becomes really hard for me to have compassion and easy to ignore their good traits.

Depending on what they did or how long they‚Äôve been a certain way towards me or others, I might make myself only surface level stage (if its a coworker, I will only talk to them about work and I‚Äôll maybe listen to them), distasteful (even at work, i‚Äôll go out of my way to avoid them and only talk to them when I need something and can‚Äôt get around it), disgusted( I straight up pretend they dont exist because looking at them has made me that angry.)

When I split white on someone, its really hard for me to accept their flaws sometimes and sometimes i‚Äôll even go so far as to justify their bad behaviors. When im at friendly stage with someon(im talk to them only about related things but open to conversation), admiration ( I actively watch and listen to them because I see they have really good traits so I view them as a role model), obsession (they become an idol to me and I get so far into them that when they mess up really bad or mistreat me I‚Äôll either try to excuse it or become devastated at the feeling of the ‚Äúbetrayal‚Äù and might split that person black almost immediately)

I find that since noticing this pattern I have, ive gotten a little scared of meeting someone new or making new friends or trying relationships on a deeper level because im aware that this mindset is irrational, very very emotional and unhealthy and hurting someone i may care about is the last thing I want.

1ce2yue,"So splitting is black or white *(I use ‚Äúor‚Äù instead of ‚Äúand‚Äù because they don‚Äôt happen simultaneously for me)* thinking and is often referred to as ‚Äúblack‚Äù for negatively splitting and ‚Äúwhite‚Äù for positively splitting. Neither is good; I‚Äôm just referring to how my brain perceives it. Both sides of the coin cause me horrible emotional anguish. 

The ‚Äúwhite‚Äù side is when I become very enamored with a person, place, or thing. I obsess over whatever I‚Äôve split on. If it‚Äôs a person, I become dependent on them for everything. My emotions, interests, and favorite things are all changed to match theirs. It evokes limerence in me. This is where the ‚Äúfavorite person‚Äù comes from for me. If it‚Äôs a place or thing, I look up *everything* about it. 

The ‚Äúblack‚Äù side is predominantly expressed as rage for me. I am normally a very nice, kind, and compassionate person, the ‚Äúmom‚Äù friend, but the moment I split on someone, which is typically triggered by something said, I become blind with rage and instantly hate them. My words become bullets, and I‚Äôm looking to catch a charge. For me, there‚Äôs a strong chance that once the rage and anger subside, I‚Äôll feel the same for that person how I did before the split.

After i got diagnosed two ish years ago i worked with my therapist to find a way to nurture those parts and understand my pain better. I‚Äôm a super visual person too so i‚Äôve always visualized all the parts inside me and especially the child within me just like how you wrote. I also came to understand that seeing my identity in these categorized parts didn‚Äôt make them isolated from each other but like an ecosystem in my 1 brain, and especially found comfort in IFS style therapy/parts therapy. Made me feel validated that understanding myself in parts was not some irrational unhealthy thing but like just a method i was comfortable with. I don‚Äôt think i could‚Äôve developed self compassion without having space to identify the parts of who i am which for me has been kinda 3 parts: 1 that is the ‚Äúmain‚Äù one that is very funny charismatic always puts on a bangin outfit (kinda like your adult one, i always visualize her as me if i was on top of all the things and lookin great while doing so). Another part just as large as the first where all my pain is, and this one i came to visualize as me as a child. It reacts based on pain so therefore can give pretty alarming suggestions upon a situation, but it comes from a place of pain.

1cdxjll,"I feel you, it is really scary and also overwhelming to comprehend it all. i‚Äôve explained to my family before how the pain i have inside me is sort of like emotional hemophilia Lol where essentially I never heal, I just get older.

I also have organized my identity by age my whole life like a tree with rings where every year another ring grows around the others, and it‚Äôs like all younger versions of me by age are still hanging out inside me, forever at the age i had been for each one. When i was ready to examine all the scary pain in my mind, i realized that the reason i never heal is because for example say something like my mom said or did when i was 7 really hurt my feelings, but in retrospect i can look back and understand how she didn‚Äôt mean to hurt me then. But inside me there‚Äôs me as a 7 year old who is still hurt and doesn‚Äôt understand what i could later understand as i got older. And essentially at least for me, this part of my mind is just 20 something tree rings made of any pain i‚Äôve felt in my life, big or small.

I‚Äôve come to a place where I‚Äôm able to act as that caring adult figure to my pain (I don‚Äôt really know how it just sorta came to be through therapy and a result of just considering and comprehending all this i guess).

The hardest, and yet most liberating thing I've had to learn is that almost everything is a gray area. Most people are good and bad. We ourselves need to accept that we will feel conflicting things, and both of those things can (and usually are) true.

The world isn't a model on a shelf. It moves and it changes. Hardly anything just is. And the more we can embrace that means we can start to forgive ourselves, set realistic expectations with other, and respect the world for it's diversity.

Black and white thinking is a pattern that feels safe because it means we don't need to do through the discomfort of digging deeper. Feelings are complicated, and it's easier to avoid it. But it's not better.

What helps for me is instead of thinking of people as one thing, I think of them like rubix cubes. They're not one block and one color that is good or bad. They're many blocks, and many colors. And each specific block can be all good or bad. But they are as a whole made up of good and bad blocks. And sometimes the blocks move and that changes what I might feel is good or bad.

1cd0gka,"Yes. I am on Depakote twice daily (250mg ER in the morning, 500mg ER in the evening) to treat my bipolar disorder type 2. I have found this dosage is my threshold dose for effectively treating my symptoms of hypomania, such as poor sleeping, euphoria, risk-taking behaviors, and poor focus. I cannot take any of the second gen mood stabilizers (such as lamotrigine or Lamictal) due to a genetic mutation that makes me at an increased risk of SJS. However, it is less ""hardcore"" than something like lithium or Topomax. Depakote for me also has the added benefit of lessening my migraine days, as I have chronic migraine.

The cons are that I have to be really mindful of my diet, caloric intake, and macros, or I gain weight easily on it--which I've always been a very thin person so this is unusual for me. However, my psychiatrist explained to me that Depakote causes weight gains due to altering hunger cues, so it has been much easier to be mindful of my diet this time around and stay at a healthy weight. I also have developed a tremor due to using Depakote.

Overall, I am happy on this medication and hope it continues to help me. I hope it helps you too! The good thing about Depakote, if it's not helpful, is that it has a fairly low half-life and you can get off it and try something new quickly. Good luck!",Traumarama79,False,1714074497.0

1cd0cju,"I have a mental health ""mentor"" through my uni and I talked to her just before I started sessions with a therapist and she warned me about this behaviour; Sometimes if we're upset by the feedback/response from a therapist we will subconsciously point this out through what we choose to tell them/how we put it forward to them. She also told me that any good therapist would pick up on this and call it out, as it can shake that relation between client and therapist.

  
with that being said I think thats happening here; you're not consciously ""attacking"" her, but the underlying seeds in what you've said could be showing some discomfort/upset with things she's talked about. I think its good that she brought it up as if it goes unchecked it can lead to your relationship with them being broken/shifted.

I'm not really sure how to approach this in what to do, all I can really suggest is giving her space (but not distancing). As another commenter said it seems there may be some dependency on your current therapist, which is why this subconscious behaviour can happen (based on what my mentor said)... so maybe working on that dependency could help too?

I‚Äôve had one who didn‚Äôt even flinch when I was crying in front of him and when I told him I felt like nobody care about me he actually scolded me and was very angry. 

The therapist (actually psychiatrist) who followed me the longest, after I asked her if she liked me said she can‚Äôt say like but that she cared for me and she did. If your therapist says that believe her, a patient-therapist relationship needs some amount of distance because they‚Äôre a professional, not your friend, your sister or your mom. They‚Äôre here to help, not love you or replace the void someone else left in you. 

Also sometimes it‚Äôs not in anyone‚Äôs best interest to talk about what someone else said about them (what your ex said).

Short story I met a woman, I miss-interpreted many of her behaviors. Including her getting naked in front of me. I didn't want to have sex with her (I was in love with her, but I didn't feel a physical attraction). It down spiraled into her breaking off contact and telling me that it ""was too much"" for her.¬†


October Rage: At first I couldn't deny what happened because she treated me like crap. I was furious, all over the place. I screamed my lungs out, hit pillows made videos about my feelings in a a creative way to put feeling in order. I wrote plenty of rage letters telling her all the slurs I could imagine and let all my imagination go wild. I never sent them Once I took all that anger out. November was full of confusion and anger and rage, I put all into art. I made masks representing my emotions, I dealt with my mommy issues because she treated me like my mother and once I got it I was grossed out. Ready to move on.


December depression. Libido down, winter full of sadness , desperation, feelings of despair, made masks again, listen to a lot of music and cried, I allowed myself cry until I got a migraine, I delt with my abandonment issues (still got them to a certain degree) and I wrote even more letters of sadness and repeated until February.¬†


Finally by the end March once I wrote her the last letter, I gathered all the letters and accepted she was gone, I burned the letters. I understood that people who thinks you are to much they feel too little. Everyone gives from their heart, what they feel inside. If she couldn't love herself she definitely could not love me.¬†

I hate it when anyone hurts so bad because of actions from just some dumb little dude, people like him aren't worth being thought of yet it is so fucking hard to stop in a case like this.

BPD is a part of you, not who you are and it doesn't need to dictate your emotions all the time. I know that sounds really dumb, I know that it seems impossible but if you say it out loud or write it down enough times, you might just start believing it. 

I do that a lot when I am hurting, I repeat to myself that these feelings I am going through aren't all that I am, they aren't all that I am feeling/sensing; I can feel the warmth of a nice bath, I can taste some delicious foods, I can listen to some beautiful music, I can hear my friend's voices, I can watch a funny Youtube video.

Where we should have been unconditionally loved as children, instead we were abused, neglected, or treated with a general distain by people that were supposed to care for us. 

Because of this trauma, we are absolutely terrified of abandonment of any kind, and will lash out at the slightest hint of someone possibly abandoning us.

1cctafs,"Ah, navigating the stormy waters of a relationship where the currents are strong and ever-changing like with BPD, that's quite the voyage, isn't it? Firstly, what I really need when my BPD is at its worst is healthy, well adjusted responses to my behaviour, so it‚Äôs essential to keep a sturdy helm‚Äîwhile maintaining your own well-being as you traverse these emotional tides. It's like being both the captain and the caretaker of your ship; you must ensure it stays afloat while caring deeply for all souls on board. It's the unfortunate thing about this condition, the determination to sink the ship you yourself are sailing on.

Now, showing compassion without getting lost in the squall‚Äîthat‚Äôs the art, isn‚Äôt it? Acknowledge their struggles, much like spotting a distant storm on the horizon, understanding its potential impact but not steering directly into it. When they reach out, it‚Äôs akin to them sending a flare into the night sky; respond with a guiding light, but maintain your course. You must protect your boundaries, like the bulwarks of a ship, sturdy yet respectful.

If they‚Äôve set upon a campaign to push you to the distant shores, remember, every sailor knows the sea can be both friend and foe. They might feel unlovable, as uncharted islands feel unreachable, but show them that the map is not yet drawn. Compassion doesn‚Äôt mean allowing oneself to be marooned; rather, it‚Äôs offering a line back to shore when they are ready to take it.

And in these moments, when the winds have calmed and they seek to mend sails, decide if you're ready to chart this course together once more. It might require new navigation, new terms, and perhaps, a new destination. But always, always sail with the heart of an explorer‚Äîcurious, brave, and always aware of the North Star (your values).

1ccf7xu,"As someone who was neglected by my parents and asexual for a long time, I get how awful it feels to have no support network and receive no physical touch. I actually lived very far from everything I knew during Covid‚ÄîI moved to a foreign country to teach English. So I get how hard it is to be isolated. But being alone all the time also means that you don‚Äôt have to risk being vulnerable and getting your feelings hurt so there‚Äôs a strength in it if you learn to enjoy solitude a little. But yeah when it‚Äôs SO much alone time, it‚Äôs so hard! When no one ever texts you, no friends and no parents, it‚Äôs awful!

If you have any close friends/parents you could ask them for more support, just like maybe a quick phone call on a specific day.

When it comes to the medication, I would say that of course you would feel awful and symptoms would come rushing in stronger than ever, because your body is literally putting in all this work trying to understand and fix what‚Äôs going on. Although im sure you‚Äôre not mentally addicted to pills your body is still dependent on them. Depending on how long you have taken these drugs, the withdrawals could last months, easily. Maybe years. But if you do not have a support network and are in a constantly stressful situation, it might just be impossible because of what you need to get done. I have had to detox from hormonal birth control, welbutrin, bupropion, and weed. The birth control is what seriously fucked with my hormones and my brain, I started it at 14 and took it for a decade. 

Something that has helped me is buying a big soft teddy bear stuffed animal that i hug at night m. My friend encouraged me to do it and I‚Äôm glad she did. I also like to unwind by drinking wine or having kava. Kava is a seriously cool tea. It has a slightly sedative and euphoric effect but somehow helps me focus and clean my room, lol! It does have interactions with alcohol and other drugs though. Music is also a powerful force, singing is so healing. I like to start my day by brushing my teeth and listening to ‚Äúpocketful of sunshine‚Äù by Natasha Bedingfield or ‚Äúhere comes the sun‚Äù by the Beatles. Fake it till you make it lol.

1ccaudj,"Google ""dissociation""

Physical symptoms include numbness in feet, and a tight sensation around the skull, like a bandana almost. Trouble verbalizing
.
Mentally, clocked out. No emotion. Disconnected from the present moment. Disorientation. 

To mitigated it helps a lot to get your feet into water, or to splash water on your face. It also helps to call someone and exchange words back and forth. It makes you real and present. A really big and easy one that you can do anywhere is to make a sound. Like step hard or slap a counter. That should help pull you back into your body. Another one is to focus on the sensation of your feet and to picture your energy pushing into your feet and extending into the ground under them

There is also a seperate symptom of not quite grasping your sense of self identity. That shows through reflecting others personalities and catchphrases. Clothing style changes a ton. The sense of abandonment might be linked to this because we base a lot of our personalities around close connections. When we lose those connections we lose a part of our constructed identity and our brains panic. It also might be like to the trauma of Abandonment that many have experience. Can you name your core personality traits and your favorite hobbies? That is a really good coping skill to defend against that lack of self-identity


I'm just going to toss in here the origins of both of these symptoms. Dissociation comes from experiencing too much emotion. With BPD our amygdalas are super unbalanced and put us in a trauma/torture state over small things. A different part of the brain cuts out our sensory intake and dissociates us when we are overwhelmed. The lack of sense of identity comes from hardwired anomalies in in the prefrontal cortex. There is a lack of connection between our ability to engage with a current task and our ability to recall memories to use in that current task. That's the leading theory anyways. Those two spots in the brain are correlated with sense of identity.",_-whisper-_,False,1714002432.0

1ccaudj,"There's a really great Haruki Marakami poem I still think about very often in regards to the empty feeling:

>""As if to build a fence around the fatal emptiness inside her, she had to create a sunny person that she became. But if you peeled away the ornamental egos that she had built, there was only an abbys of nothingness and the intense thirst that came with it. Though she tried to forget it, the nothingness would visit her periodically - on a lonely rainy afternoon, or at dawn when she woke up from a nightmare. What she needed at such times was to be held by someone, anyone."" - Haruki Murakami

For me, the empty feeling is a tangible void inside me but it's also a state of being that I get stuck in

I can literally *feel* this cavernous void inside my body where something *should* be, like a part of me has been ripped out, except it's just never been there.  I can feel it physically, the emptiness, it's like a gaping hole that aches in its emptiness and it's distressing and in those times, I'm compelled to try and ""fill"" that void by any means necessary, ""the intense thirst"", because I just *need* to not be able to feel it. I've done some really fkn toxic, insane, unstable and extremely dangerous things not feel it; taking a lot of drugs, drinking heavily, taking refuge in someones, (anyones) arms whether it's safe or not.

And then sometimes it's dissatisfaction and I just don't feel real. The people I care about, my responsibilities, all my ""earthly tethers"" to life feel very far away from me and not real and I can't force myself to acknowledge the urgency of actually caring about or addressing these things.

As for not knowing who were are, well, here's another Murakami except:

>""I always feel as if I'm struggling to become someone else. As if I'm trying to find a new place, grab hold of a new life, a new personality. I suppose it's part of growing up, yet it's also an attempt to re-invent myself. By becoming a different me, I could free myself of everything. I seriously believed I could escape myself - as long as I made the effort. But I always hit a dead end. No matter where I go, I still end up me. What's missing never changes. The scenery may change, but I'm still the same old incomplete person. The same missing elements torture me with a hunger that I can never satisfy. I think that lack itself is as close as I'll come to defining myself."" - Haruki Murakami

So the not knowing who you are is kinda tied into the emptiness but also has almost everything to do with unstable sense of self, basically, because a total lack of consistency in how we feel towards ourselves, the world and other people, because we can flip on a dime about how we feel about something (switching) and our emotions are so big that a lot of they time they feel like facts, not just feelings and ultimately end up controlling our actions without us being able to perceive that, it can really feel like life is happened TO us and that we don't have any control over anything really, therefore it can be difficult to know who we are, what we want, how we feel about ourselves and life.

Then I moved more into the attention seeking subtypes, the flirty, engaging and impulsive subtypes, always wanting to be out and around ppl and this is when I struggled to understand that ‚ÄúEmpty‚Äù feeling as well bc I also felt like I just exuded so much of myself, being quirky and happy and having days where I literally felt like god, like no one could compare to me! üòå

Now‚Ä¶ I am starting to understand that ‚ÄúEmpty‚Äù feeling! I have moved out of the attention seeking subtype and moving into the petulant subtype üòî this subtype is more irritable and impatient with an unpredictable moody disposition! üòí I don‚Äôt really wanna be around anyone and little things set me off and make me quick to anger and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just bc I‚Äôm getting older and I‚Äôm just not interested in being out and around people and being flirty and engaging but moving into this subtype has been a HUGE CHANGE for me!

Now, as for struggling with identity‚Ä¶ I feel like, for me anyways, that that comes from wanting ppl to like me soooo much that I start adopting parts of THEIR personality into mine! üòÖ for example, I meet someone new and I don‚Äôt want them to lose interest in wanting to be around me so I will figure out the things they like and I will tell myself that those things are really cool and I like them too!

1cc3h0x,"I can totally understand and empathize with this. You definitely aren‚Äôt alone and everything is completely valid. I don‚Äôt know if this will help or not. I decided to make a very long post because you mentioned it's your first relationship after the symptoms started to show, and not having it in prior ones. But what has helped me, personally, was putting in more effort to try my best to trust her in the long term and creating healthy boundaries. I‚Äôll explain!

""It doesn't feel that way"" rings a very familiar bell. In case you relate: for me, I felt that sometimes because I had conflicting thoughts, when I would be triggered I would weigh on what she did or didn't do, and that stressful charge had precedence over her reassurance, therefore it felt unresolved and consequently I felt overwhelmed.  I needed that constant stream of reassurance to feel better and many times that wasn‚Äôt enough. What felt like enough at first only grew as the relationship went on. What we did was set two-sided mutual boundaries, so when I found myself needing to keep asking for reassurance, I would tell myself ‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt leave me because‚Ä¶‚Äù, or she loves me because x, y, z, it meant asking less so that I could have that space to self rely on my logic and trust myself too - which I know might overwhelming during splits - and attempting to trust the relationship for what it now. It took lots of work, honestly, but it helped me learn how to trust her and myself more. Healthy boundaries like this will help give space, while also allowing you to grow and learn how to manage some of these symptoms more, to get comfortable with connecting the dots to feel safe. Does this make sense?

Outline the reasons you know your partner loves you, and remember those reasons when you slip into an episode. Perhaps it‚Äôs: he spends time with me, he goes out of his way to make me a better person, he is affectionate with me. Remembering those good things may help you when you split, so it‚Äôs good to write it down somewhere. Another thing that may help is pushing to try more self care activities and things happening in your life. Routine, getting enough rest, doing hobbies especially. Volunteering, etc. I say this because it may support you and your growth especially when in a relationship

Keep continuing with therapy, be honest with your therapist and if you don‚Äôt have a therapist, I encourage you to look around! Also look around for support groups if you'd like. You absolutely got this, and try to really believe that your partner is here for a reason, chose you for a reason, it's about turning that into self-validation, which should get easier as you grow. He loves you for a reason. And no matter what, just try to embrace this in your darkest moments, even if it's hard to believe, even if there's millions of racing thoughts that say otherwise.

I totally get that it‚Äôs easy to believe these horrible things when something goes wrong, or a minor trigger creates the end of the world. Breathe, identify that trigger, pull out the logic and reminders, journal those emotions, set mutual healthy boundaries, communicate. I learnt that it takes being a team on both sides to healthily get through these obstacles, and lots of communication. I really do believe it gets easier. I recommend reading some books on BPD if you haven‚Äôt already, along with doing the BPD Workbook to help you navigate these emotions. ""I Hate You - Don't Leave Me"" is good, I hear ""The Buddha and The Borderline"" is great. I have not read a ton of books on this so others might have better suggestions

1cbk6qa,"So I'm 23, so my experience, you probably won't be able to relate at first, but I'm gonna break a few things down just so you know I'm coming from like. A place of ""holy shit dude same."" (Also note: very cross faded rn so apologies for spelling mistakes and goofy wording)

Because I didn't have a mom or dad and my grandmother, who ended up being my guardian, couldn't read, I was parentified from the young age of 7-ish. My dad wasn't in my life, and my mom was schizophrenic/navy.

In my scenario, your mom is my grandma. I had an older brother who was constantly getting into trouble. And she would treat him horribly, so he treated her horribly. And I was the emotional support stuffed animal everyone ran to.

It all comes from this place of ""I need to survive"" because I remember that the whole time I was living with her, I was counting the days practically. I remember I was just waiting so patiently while she'd lie about the most inoccuous stuff to people, and I had to back her up for it. Little shit too, like if I told her something dangerous my brother was doing, we'd tell him God told her. But then my brother, when in trouble, outed me to grans, and she said she knew from a work of God at first. And I ripped into her.

This is all to say. A big part of BPD is just finding yourself. Because whatever you built during that time you were spending in that environment, that wasn't you. That was your stepford model!

Now that you're kinda coming to terms with everything, you wanna start processing the emotion. It's okay to be upset, angry, sad, or whatever else. Emotions are not intrinsically bad. They're just emotions. They tell you when your brain feels slighted. When your soul feels slighted. They're there to tell you what your boundaries are and how you should heal.

This won't be a linear process at all. You will feel guilty sometimes for your anger and your emotions because you were trained to feel that way. That's okay. But the important thing is that you understand that guilt isn't real. You're totally valid in any emotions you feel towards your parental figure. It's okay to say that figure did their best raising you, but also admit they were abusive at times.

Ain't nobody in this world that loves me more than my grandma, but ain't nobody in this world can hurt me like she can. Maybe it's the same with you and your ma, I dunno. What I do know is that this is your journey, and it's your choice if you want to forgive her, when you want to forgive her, etc etc. But right now, just sit in it. Let yourself feel that pain. It's kind of like taking venom out of a snake to make an antidote. It's painful, and it hurts, but God, it helps.",LaserBatBunnyUnder,False,1713924149.0

It‚Äôs uniform grey/brown and you scrub and scrub and scrub , and then suddenly spots and contrast appears , and the wall looks more dirty than it did before, when it was saturated with smoke.  . . the scrubbing is just excavating different layers of grime , all with their unique patterning. I think about that a lot , especially when I get discouraged .

1cbk6qa,"You are welcome. I hope it helps you as much as it has helped me so far. I will say this, before listening to those books, I didn't think I could be any madder at my parents, but oh my, could I. I am pissed at my parents for basically ruining just about everything in my life. Like these past few days, I have been taking foot baths because I have calluses on my feet to a degree that is ridiculous, I should have done something about this years ago, but apparently there is only one way to do this. It has taken me at least 15 years to just bathe my feet as I want to without thinking about it being wrong. 

Before I left home to live on my own at 21, I had always thought that everything would change for the better when I did so. But it didn't. My parents still wanted to be a controlling part of my life. I have my entire adult life known that something was wrong with the way our relationship was, and the older I got, the more they indirectly made it clear that my brother was their favourite. I knew this before I moved out though, but I had this fantasy that if got an education that my parents wanted they would be proud of me and actually tell me this,  but they have never said so but always want to talk about how well my brother is doing when I see them or talk on the phone. And if they don't talk about my brother, they rather quickly turn to talking about themselves, and I honestly don't care anymore. They have never really listened to any of my problems, and the ones they did hear they either shrugged at or brushed off as unimportant.

A couple of years ago, I heard a podcast with comedian Bill Burr and Mike Tyson, where Mike said something along the lines of ""your anger is masking your hurt. And you know who hurt you."" That stuck with me, and I didn't doubt for a second that it was my parents, but I haven't been able to really put it together upon till now, having listened to those books. It is the most freeing thing I have done in my life. Listening to those books and doing the tasks suggested in them. It is also some of the hardest work I have done on myself, and honestly, I am scared at what the end result will be. I am afraid that my wife and I will both realise that we are a wrong match. This probably won't happen and these thought is most likely just my old stupid inner voice that has been conditioned by my parents to think that it is dangerous to speak my mind and that nobody cares and that I will scare my wife away with my thoughts and opinions. In a moment of reality and clarity, I know she loves me and will work on this with me no matter how tough it might get.

Sorry for the word vomiting. It was just nice to relate to someone about all of this.

Thank you for believing in me. I have come to realise that I have done quite well without their approval and their help, so I am sure I will get through this as well.

1cbk6qa,"Wow. I‚Äôm in tears for you. Because .. when a man opens up emotionally, I get sad for them, due to yes the conditioning over so many years that men should not show emotion. Men‚Äôs emotions are strong and can move mountains when used properly. Which you‚Äôre doing!! So cool!! Happy to hear you have a supportive wife. I understand the fears of ‚Äúthey‚Äôre going to leave‚Äù. I have that daily, unintentionally. But, also a sadness took over me because -. same in so many ways. 

Except I knew very young that she was rotten. I had a Ho my iron on my face as a newborn. Grew up asking about the scar that was still fading away in my teens , and was told multiple stories and scolded to stop asking. My earliest memories are so traumatic I still can‚Äôt really talk about them in therapy. We have to make up imaginary containers to put those thoughts in , it‚Äôs just so much. Deep, deeeeep hurt and pain. Agree with Tyson! Which is weird ! Haha, but yes I do. And I am angry now, now in my 40s, I worked so hard on myself yet was barking up the wrong trees the whole time. By working on me , what I was really doing was trying to keep fault on me , blame me , bash me and basically tried killing me over and over and over. I think we are indestructible for real. I shouldn‚Äôt be alive. 

Someone above commented ‚ÄúI think you may feel love and safety and comfort for the first time and now the time you can heal‚Äù and that realllyyy got me. It‚Äôs true. My husband did not start out fantastic. He actually triggered me so much and I started connecting a lot of dots 5 years ago when we met. He would shut down and avoid during any conflict or emotional conversation. Mom trigger. She constantly acted like I didn‚Äôt exist. My abandonment wounds were so bad I dissociated all school day, wanting to be home so she wouldn‚Äôt leave me. Would scream and cry to not go to class, it‚Äôs just a lot. And so much more , but he finally got sober too, and has been in therapy, and AA , and he‚Äôs done so much work that I‚Äôm in awe of his recovery. I really do feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù now for the first time. 

I also cut off my mom January. Freeing for sure, but definitely mixed in guilt like you were saying, the conditioned thoughts! And let me tell you, I am the #1 enemy out of my siblings and have always been, she‚Äôs successfully gotten them to hate me. When I got sober in my 30s , she bashed me to everyone. I didn‚Äôt understand her reaction when I thought parents should want their children healthy and sober, then I realized she didn‚Äôt want me to get better. Getting better was a threat to her, there was no I love yous, no ‚Äúyou‚Äôre beautiful‚Äù, never once , but gushes over my siblings like they can do no wrong. That always hurt a lot. , she literally abandoned me multiple times as a child, made me keep cheating secrets from my dad, made me keep serioussss secrets from everyone. And I‚Äôm just a messy mess. 

Now it‚Äôs my turn to apologize for the story. Just like you said again, to relate is rare. I am so thankful I made this into a post. You have all been so fckng kind. Grateful and keeping positive vibes all around ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è",Psych-obsessed,True,1714007119.0

1cbk6qa,"Don't be sorry about your story. Telling it is part of the process. I am sorry you had to go through that as a child and later as an adult. 

Thank you for those kind words. I think you are completely right about how men have been told to not show emotions is a problem in general and maybe if my dad had shown some of his emotions other than anger this would have been different.

My parents never hurt me physically, but they indirectly told me that I was never enough no matter what I did or didn't do. I think this only shows how much one can relate to others even though they didn't go through the exact same experience.

Just like you, I have been working on myself for most of my adult life. Heck, even when I was a child, I had to work on myself, especially my temper, which in hindsight seems ridiculous because my dad never did anything to work on his, at least not until some years after both my brother and I had left home. And just like you, it has always been with the assumption that I needed to change or that I was at fault. I have never been able to talk about my feelings and opinions on stuff that matters to me with being scared that I would push people away by doing so, so in most cases I would either stay quiet and do whatever others wanted or only disclosed a small proportion of my feelings. 

Even though my parents never turned my brother against me, like your mother has yours, I certainly feel your pain of being the black sheep of the family.

I am glad you are getting better now and that you have found the strength to cut her out of your life. That can not have been easy. 

I can't figure out how much I want my parents to be a part of my life, I know I want them to be a part of my children's as long as they treat them nicely. But at this point, I am not going to reach out. I intend to speak with my brother about it at some point in the future, when I have figured out who I, in fact, am and what kind of relationship I want to have with them.

I think it‚Äôs best to understand that your view of yourself is everything and it takes work. I‚Äôm not sure how old you are, but you‚Äôve probably had different forms of yourself.

But you didn‚Äôt remain that identity because you are NOT that identity. And if you were born to a healthier family that was wealthy, you‚Äôd have a different identity.

Something that might also help us learning about bpd together. Maybe shed like doing something like Dr. Fox's Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook, and sharing that with you. Perhaps watching some YouTube videos about Borderline (I like Dr. Fox's channel as well) together from time to time and discussing how she relates and doesn't relate, not only will be some quality time together, but can allow you both to better understand the disorder, which can maybe help her find the answers to those ""I don't knows"", and help you understand better ways of support. And maybe  doing that together will make her feel safer about being vulnerable around you, and comfort her seeing you're willing to learn about this with her rather than making her do it herself.

If course, that's if she wants to. If not, you can do it separately, or you can use those resources just as a learning opportunity yourself

My mom has very severe trauma from her childhood because of my abusive grandfather. She was very depressed throughout my childhood, and took on some of the abusive patterns she suffered from.

My brother is diagnosed with BPD (his childhood was way worse than mine), and I‚Äôm in the evaluation process for a BPD diagnosis since I show pretty much all of the symptoms.

1caob9v,"Extremely religious dad, emotionally dependent mom, she was either cold or too close. My two older brothers were always assholes, I honestly believe that‚Äôs where my problems stemmed from, my oldest brother would straight up emotionally terrorize me and my second to oldest would be indifferent or cold. There was either too much or not enough my entire life. 
When I say terrorize I mean like he would straight up tell me chucky lived under my bed and that multiple little girls died in my room and that ghosts lived in the vents or waited in my closet to trap me in there with them, all as I was growing up, all before I even turned seven. They made fun of everything I wore, everything I liked. Spice girls? Gay. Backstreet Boys? Gay. Britney Spears? Gay. (It was late 90‚Äôs early 00‚Äôs and gay meant lame af back then) I stayed away from any of that, I was sheltered, I adopted everything they liked because everything that I liked was lame.
I was told multiple times that I whined too much and tattle tale was my label. 
I remember always self deprecating so they would pay attention to me or even acknowledge me.
We were never made to join any recreational activities, never made to do chores, never made to get jobs, never expected much out of any of us.
We often paid for my older brother‚Äôs mistakes. 
I was never close to my brothers and very dependent on my parents, always told that no one would or could love me as much as they did. A lot of guilt was used as a motivator. Every day was a battle, we were raised thinking that siblings were not friends and people you didn‚Äôt like but had to love, like they would never hang out with you unless you were related. We often fought and argued too much. We were taught to be different and always had our own little worlds. Never shared, always pitted us against each other.
I honestly haven‚Äôt even thought about any of this because the more I think about it, the more I resent them all.
My parents also instilled in me that I was the child and that they were the parents; I.e they were responsible for me, I was never really taught to account for myself. Everything I did was a reflection of who THEY were. I was never treated as an equal or as an adult or even as a responsible human. I was always told ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my baby and you will always be the baby‚Äù ‚Äúeven if you‚Äôre forty I‚Äôm still going to spank you‚Äù 
I wish I were kidding.
I was never beat with a fist, I was never sexually assaulted, I never went hungry and I was never neglected or left on my own. But I was also never validated nor was I taught real values. I was emotionally starved.
The dysfunction was treated as a baseline for how families were. 
Strangers and outside people were treated in higher regard because it‚Äôs what Jesus would do. We have been robbed, my parents even let an undocumented grown man stay in my bedroom who stole all our valuables. I was an eight year old girl. When caught, my dad did nothing.
 I also slept between my parents until about 13-14 years old, my oldest brother really did a number on me. And he was always right because he ‚Äúloved me and he‚Äôs the oldest brother‚Äù so he couldn‚Äôt do any harm. I often wonder if he had sexually assaulted me how my parents would have moved.
I‚Äôm pregnant, my cousin moved here two years ago with her daughters. She got divorced a year ago. Mind you I had made plans to 1) get pregnant 2) move in with my parents to save for our own house. We constantly had these conversations with my parents, that they were concrete plans and that we counted on them. Well at a month or two after we announced, I got a call that she moved in. She was staying in my old room (guess some things never change) she had stolen my identity and opened a credit card and tanked my credit before any of this. I found out at 5 months along. My parents didn‚Äôt do anything, they told me ‚ÄúJesus would forgive‚Äù they said I shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúlose control‚Äù and that they didn‚Äôt want to tell me because they knew I would. Instead they told my husband who in turn told me. I had to tell my aunt who works with credit and I needed to know what steps to take, she was the only one to validate my anger, the one to tell my parents how fucked up they were and to get her tf out of their house.
I was not able to move back, I still live three hours away, they haven‚Äôt visited me and have called a handful of times since mid February. They tell me how they‚Äôre catching hell from me and shame from family. Poor them. They also keep making plans for me to visit postpartum and stay in the house. They keep making plans about my baby. They aren‚Äôt even calling to plan this with me, they are only excited amongst themselves.
They also want me to invited the cousin to my baby shower. Fml. I thought I‚Äôd have a village, instead I see things clear as day now. My emotions no longer get the best of me but I suffer unspeakable sorrow every day.
I thought I was doing amazing emotionally and financially and that I could add to our family. I wasn‚Äôt even fully aware of my diagnosis, just told I was bipolar, and then bpd which I ignorantly thought bpd stood for bipolar disorder.
I‚Äôm 8 months along, I see what I should‚Äôve seen before I even made this decision. I regret my choice, I wish I had not signed my son up for a life of misery of having me as a mom. I know I‚Äôm broken and that I probably won‚Äôt be enough or too much. That he‚Äôll most likely suffer the way I have. I can‚Äôt go back now. 
I am in therapy. I just don‚Äôt know how well it‚Äôs going, two sessions in and she already schedules me every two weeks even though I wanted every week, makes me feel like she‚Äôs annoyed by me or just thinks I‚Äôm too much.

1caob9v,"I learned how to read and accommodate for people‚Äôs emotions with little regard for my own when I was 2 years old. My father had 3 kids that I know of before me and my brother and he wanted nothing to do with us. He said as much in a letter he sent me for Christmas when I was 8. His wife is an extremely uncaring, hateful woman, so much so that when she met me when I was 4 years old, she told me she‚Äôd knock the teeth out of my head if I ever hurt my father. 

My mother was extremely emotionally manipulative and verbally abusive. To make it easier to understand, my parents were boomers, so there was always some form of martyrdom happening. The usual, ‚Äúpoor pitiful me, I have kids and it‚Äôs hard and they‚Äôre ungrateful.‚Äù I say were because they‚Äôre both dead. 

When I was 6, I was sexually abused by a 12 year old family friend‚Äôs son on 4 separate occasions. I allowed it to happen each time, because I was under the impression that I had to do anything to keep people happy. The only reason I told my mother was because my little brother saw it happen the last time, and I didn‚Äôt want it to hurt him. When I told my mother, she alerted the family friends, then allowed them to call, cuss me out, and call me a lying, manipulative little b-word, and she did nothing to stop them. Not only that, but a week later, she brought me over to the house of the parent‚Äôs whose kid molested me to visit with them. 

As a teenager, anytime there was an argument between us, my mother would call someone to step in for her, whether it be the neighbor, my aunt, or my step-father and I‚Äôd be told that I was an evil, selfish, hateful child and that I didn‚Äôt deserve the mother I had. My aunt, who was usually the one she called, was especially hateful and would call me pretty much anything but a child of god. Since my mother passed and I‚Äôve gained my diagnosis, I strongly believe she went undiagnosed with BPD her whole life. She was very hot and cold. Loving and dismissive. Uplifting and demeaning. She could make you feel like you were the only thing that mattered in the world in one moment, and the next she could make you feel like you weren‚Äôt worth existing. 

On top of this, I had a step-father that was a lying, stealing, pitiful drunk that would cause a stink any time my mother wasn‚Äôt giving him all of her attention. My brother and I got about 10 minutes with our mother when she got home from work before he would come up and start an argument with me so he could have her to himself. I found him multiple times foaming at the mouth from a mixture of opioids and alcohol at a young age. My brother told the school, and my mother had us lie to CPS so they wouldn‚Äôt take us away. At 13 years old, I had to be the one that told him to stop drinking, or to leave, because no one else would. That obviously didn‚Äôt work out because my mother enabled him. So he stuck around. I was an extremely angry teenager and I didn‚Äôt understand why then, but now I know it‚Äôs because I have BPD. Me lashing out made it really easy for me to be the family scape goat. To this day, my step father and the neighbor as well as many others that knew my mother, believe me to be an evil, unfeeling monster and are surprised when I have anything positive to say. That, or they‚Äôre angry because I‚Äôm not meeting their expectations of me lashing out or being hateful. Not that they have the opportunity to talk to me, because I‚Äôve done well to cut out negative people in my life these past few months.

I turned out to be a cybergoth kind of a gal that ended up being tough and bisexual who preferred her men skinny and feminine, which she despised. Everything I did was wrong, even later when I calmed down, started looking a bit more civilised (dropped the cyber, left just goth) and settled down with a regular guy (not a walking muscle, but he looked like a man, 'not a trannie' - her words). She can't handle her booze and she always makes it clear she hates me, even though she says that she loves me and makes sure everyone on social media knows how much of a truth it is. She loves my brother though, she would die for him. Even when he told her he's gay and he won't give her grandchildren. Since then she started being way more pushy towards me, even once asking me if we have troubles getting pregnant with my bf. I was furious when I heard that as we've never said we even thought about it, not to mention talk or plan for it.

I haven't spoken to her much since 2019. Once every few months over a phone. I saw her once when my brother came over to my place for Christmas. She was always reluctant towards seeing me, but as soon as she heard from someone that my brother is visiting for Christmas she pushed herself in with her drunkard partner. I only let her in for the sake of my brother. That was the only time my bf met her. She was supposed to visit me on a few other occasions like Easter or my birthday, but she would never show up. Her phone would be switched off so I'd be worrying about what's going on, until she'd texted me a few days later that she was so sick she couldn't even send me a text.

we have public health services but there is a general notion that they are not very good. the doctors/therapists are overworked and dont give the personalized attention that you need. ive never been attended by the public health system but just today i read someone comment on reddit that their sessions lasted only 15 minutes.



i had health insurance and my therapy sessions lasted only 30 min and thats pretty standard for any health plan in the country. i attended the sessions online because i lived in the country and only saw her once a week. my psychiatrist was to increase my psychotherapy sessions to twice a week because i wasnt getting better, but my insurance has expired and i couldnt continue the treatment at this clinic and i wont be able to see my therapist again unfortunately. i have a new insurance plan, but i need my doctor to prescribe the therapy sessions so i can continue with the treatment. ill have to see my doctor outside the plan and pay the exorbitant price for her session to do that.



these professionals from health insurance plans are not the best either and ive been through a lot of professionals in my lifetime, i just settled for this one for lack of motivation to keep looking for ""the one"". its also a very industrious system: a lot of patients and not much time to work with.



i dont know how is your relationship with your parents and ill give myself the liberty to share my own experience with you. ive been where you are, struggling to live independently afar from my family and in the worst moments of crises having my family around was still what saved me. they are far from perfect but they are still family.",tetrasbox,False,1713791863.0

We were, still are actually, pretty much the same person except our gender, I am a girl, he is a guy. He was in a relationship even before we begun texting. It started out with talking about music but quickly turned sexual and then, after a few months, we built a strong emotional connection. We spent countless hours texting, pouring our deepest and darkest thoughts, secrets, feelings to each other. Sex wasn't even the most important topic despite the sexual tension being off the charts. We tried having sex twice, both times it was a fail due to his nerves. He was extremely excited, he expressed several times how he can't believe that we are actually doing this, that we actually got to that point, especially because we spent years not talking to each other due to a silly fight we had as kids. He said that he has been wanting me for years, it was all very intense and painful since he was in a relationship. At certain times, it seemed like he wanted to break it off with her and be with me, which at the time, I kind of wanted but I am glad it didn't happen. The truth was, we were horrible for each other. We encouraged our shitty depressed mindsets, it was not healthy. We stopped talking after the second and last time we tried having sex. Soon after, his girlfriend also found out about it, we only spoke a little that morning and never again. It's been 8 months, I kind of miss him.

1ca429u,"Imo, it isn't really your fault he distanced himself from everyone and didn't (from what i read here) want to talk it out like adults. Fuck ups will always happen even without bpd though so worrying abt not being able to stop is going to stress you more than the actual ones.

I've been with my partner for a little over 2 years now even though we have known each other since kindergarten. It's a rough road to travel on with both of us worrying abt the other not caring about you but we give each other validation trough constant telling each other i love you and stuff because we talked it over and even though sometimes i split into just not caring abt anyone for a few days i still tell her i love her 100x a day so she doesn't freak out abt it. I think whats helping us get trough fights and stuff is just talking abt what bothers us if we fight we get it over with and when we chill out we talk calmly and apologize. 
The bigger problem arises when only one of us fucks up and then becomes overly sexual as a response to the whole thing whilst the other is still angry. But that doesnt really last long.

My one and only experience is with her, she'd been diagnosed a lot longer than me but trough me getting diagnosed as well, we kinda got closer i think because each of us knows the other gets it when we have bad times in the day its not the most important thing ever since we can talk to each other about it without any guilt or anything.

Then put your expanded ability to tolerate emotional distress help you sort through all the crap that contributed to or was a result of being a PW BPD.  All the parental neglect, parentification of children, all the times the caregivers deliberately avoided giving guidance, all the times you gladly punched down on someone else because you had no idea how to constructively deal with the shitshow at home.  

Also make a pile of all the choices, thoughts, and actions that make you cringe and that you regret.  This starts off feeling shameful and humiliating, but it's not; it's just plain necessary.  I had a lot of shame, at any rate.  I had to tap into that regret until I started to understand it, and how I could make my behaviour better than that with only a very low risk of regret being a possible consequence of the person I wanted to become.

Do you watch Survivor?  I really like that show, though the drama gets too intense for me sometimes.  Hidden immunity idols are a big part of camp life on the island; people spend a lot of time looking, and while they're not easy to find, people find them all the time.  This most recent season, production actually showed a player who was desperate and inconsolable over knowing he would get voted off unless he had an idol.  Seeing him sobbing on his knees, begging God to help him find an idol (that's pretty Old Testament :) ).  I'm positive this player is not the first and is far from the last contestant to be pushed that far, but that is not even remotely how to successfully play the game.  I hope you can see what I'm trying to get at with this.

Finding suitable role models helps.  Like Marcus Aurelius, he ruled during a golden age of the Roman Empire for decades; didn't have productivity software or bullet journals to help, in addition to the privilege afforded by his family's wealth, he knew what his values were and how to focus on the few things he could actually do each day.  He had a good idea of how many tasks he could take on at once, and structured his life to making the performing of those tasks simple.  I've been slowly reading his meditations, it's part of a larger goal to see skills and attitudes as achievable and doable.  I've started down the path of gaining skills and I'm doing stuff that was formerly impossible or very discouraging; my mantra is we improve at the skills we practice, and for a long time one of these skills for me was being helpless.

1c9rc9o,"I hope that I can be of some help to you because I'm both Filipino-American and have bpd. I totally understand the feeling of ""I should just die"" when my partner and I have conflict. It's the first place my brain goes and it's extremely scary. My therapist and I are learning to do CBT to navigate the unhealthy thoughts that surround the reaction.

I am very comfortable speculating why your wife feels it's divisive for you to be on a diet instead of eat her traditional foods. Let me start by saying that my family overseas is poor, like, some of us in the rice fields poor. I am vegetarian myself. The last time I was in the Philippines, I lost weight and my family felt I was behaving rudely because I turned down meals, which were mostly pork and chicken. The idea that someone could have food and turn it down is extremely unusual in the Philippines, and may come across as rude. In our culture, also, being overweight is a sign of having enough to eat, and isn't necessarily seen as bad. (As a diabetes-prone culture, this is not a great mentality either.)

It will take a lot of back and forth, and emotional fortitude on your part to not take these cultural nuances personally, but your wife will need a lot of explaining that the diet is for your health. You might also work with her to explore more diet-friendly Filipino foods. It's hard to get Filipinos to change on food--when my mom recommended to my Auntie that she only have rice twice a day, she scoffed!--but there's a ton of options out there. I highly recommend The Foodie Takes Flight as a resource for Filipino vegan recipes, for example.

The dentistry aspect may be another cultural shift. It is very expensive in the Philippines to see a dentist, and common to never have seen one. Your wife may have been looking for help to initiate that process, not expect you to do all the legwork.

I also think sometimes our culture can just be, frankly, loud and critical of people, even people we love. I catch myself doing this to my loved ones and my loved ones definitely do this to me. It's so hard when we already don't like ourselves to not take it personally, but I promise your wife loves you and just has a different way of showing it than we do here in the States.

1c9euhm,"Relationships are a lot of work, and the work for us is overcoming our insecurity and our constant paranoia of people not liking us or bad things happening.

Bad things that are out of our control happen to everybody. There is no getting around that. But the disappointment of feeling like you let yourself down by cheating is far worse. And on the other end of the spectrum, if you can overcome your insecurity and not act on your impulses, later on you will reflect and be proud of yourself.

I was feeling very insecure one time because my girlfriend was not texting me back. This is very common for her. She will fall asleep a lot and text back when she wakes up. I told her that I can get insecure or intrusive thoughts whenever people don‚Äôt text me back and she had the idea of downloading a tracker so I can always see where she is at and not have to worry.

I have never had that sort of thing in any relationship and always thought it was something jealous couples do. But it was her idea. 

So I downloaded the app and I can see her at her house and even how much phone charge she has which is always a good indication when she is about to go to sleep or at least charge her phone, which is why it‚Äôs not on her.  I was like, wow, my girlfriend really trusts me that much to let me track her. And not only let me, but it was actually her idea. Maybe I should trust her also.

Well, a few days later, she told me she was super depressed and I‚Äôm checking in with her throughout the day just to be supportive and she quits answering my texts. I checked the tracker and she is at a different location at two in the morning.

You already see where I‚Äôm going.

I stayed calm. I told myself that maybe she just went to her mom‚Äôs because she wasn‚Äôt feeling well. 

I texted her and told her that I saw she was at a different location and that I wasn‚Äôt upset, but that I need her to explain herself and be honest with me, but I would always trust her because she has never given me a reason not to.

The next day, she text me and tells me that she is at her mom‚Äôs because she wasn‚Äôt feeling very well and wanted to be around people she doesn‚Äôt self harm. And then she FaceTime me and I can see her inside of her mom‚Äôs house with her mom‚Äôs cat, etc..

Not only was I relieved, but I was also very proud of myself for not immediately jumping to conclusions. I had to go to bed still uncertain what was happening, but I was calm and didn‚Äôt worry too much. that‚Äôs from years of working on myself that way I don‚Äôt blow up and immediately jump to the worst conclusions and say or do something hurtful that I can‚Äôt take back.

So not only was I relieved, but I felt so good about myself like ‚Äúsee, propertyadvanced? You can trust people sometimes.‚Äù For me it was a type of milestone.

1c9aho2,"I can't give you a straight answer. I do not have bpd. But I'd like to leave anyone who read this with a story of love. The inner thoughts of those who have left. 

I speak from the point of having left a relationship with a beautiful soul who suffers from borderline. It was only 3 months, but it was the most important relationship I have ever had. 

After I left her, I went through so many emotions. Pain, loss, grief, depression, guilt, shame, and sadness at having to walk away from the person whom I loved more than I have ever loved anyone in my entire life. At 43 years of age. 

She was the only person I've ever confessed to that I loved her,  and I meant it with all my heart and soul. 

The hardest part to come to terms with was. Confusion. 

Why, when I only wanted to love and care for her forever, did I want her to suffer after I left? Like the pain I felt?

After much soul searching, I came to a peaceful resolution that she did in fact give me back the equal amount of love that I gave her the whole time,  It was expressed as well as she was able to when dealing with the shifting thoughts about herself like yourself. 

I knew what I walked into when we were deep into the ups and downs. I wasn't sure why throughout the entire relationship,  but I knew there was a very special reason we chose each other for this period 

Me, the smothered son of loving parents, lonely, desperate, bored, inexperienced man of the suburbs who wanted to break free of the world I was handed.  Her, the child of the inner city streets, bar tender, many relationships, drugs, extreme highs. Extreme lows and constant experiences with multiple lovers and let downs. 

2 opposite lives coming together for the most challenging relationship either of us have known. 

We confused each other. 

My peaceful happiness came after a while away from her.  When moving on and it seemed impossible to justify anything that happened, other than a mistake. 

She gave me something greater than anyone ever gave me. The strength to know that I could walk into the future with the confidence to follow my dreams without the self-doubt, the very  same thong I felt she she was taking advantage of at the time. She was doing her best. And her best was a home run. 

I didn't want to argue with her at the end. I wanted to leave that beautiful soul for her to discover how my love and hope for her was expressed differently than all the narcissists,  the abusers, the clinging, the ones that wanted to come back again for the drug of the roller coaster of the bpd soul such as hers feel is all they have to offer. 

In the last weeks, when I knew our journey was ending,  I treated her as I would love it to have been if she could reciprocate.  Up until her birthday was over. Although I felt used and manipulated, I gave her every loving word, attitude, hug, and love I would have always wanted to. 

Then I simply wrote to her one night. ""Please don't contact me again r*****.""

This may seem harsh, but what could I say that wouldn't express that our journey in person was over, but that her spirit would live with me forever? Should I react in anger.  No, I knew that would change nothing for her or me. 

She knew she'd crossed a line at the end. She was trying to fix it but was confused. I didn't want to see her struggle to express this to me. I already knew she felt horrible and afraid. 

But we both had to feel that pain. 

I don't believe for one second now that two souls come together without knowingly, subconsciously seeing something important in the other. And that the more you love, the greater the importance. Even if it's a fleeting moment in time, that experience reverberates forever. 

She gave me a gift that changed the trajectory of my dead end path of seeking validation in others and fear to do anything I really wanted to do. She gave me love for myself when all was said and done. 

Nobody else could have reached me like  she did. Nobody cared enough to challenge my thoughts. 

I'm certain that in time, after all the emotion she went through when i suddenly left, that she will be able to understand from our brief encounter that people  are out there rooting for her enough to find the strength in herself to reach out and seek help for herself. 

At the time of our relationship, she had no true friends. Just me and her daughter. I baffled her with my seemingly, to her, complete naivety to the rules and hardness of this world and human beings. Why did i not play games like the others? That's the way it works. Everyone knows that. 

So, what is my point to you all? 


Whilst you feel you are a mess of a human being, your emotions change from moment to moment, and you seem to hurt people who come close. What is wrong with you? 

 please understand that if people could go back in time to save you from the life that neglected you, maybe abused you, we all would.

1c97hti,"First of all: Don't worry, nothing wrong with beeing selfish. We all are. Every individual, not even just limited to humans, no literally every living beeing out there (except maybe for some specific insects, like ants) is at its core selfish. That's nothing bad, it's just normal. Pretending you would't be, would be lying to yourself. 

Having that out of the way, let's talk about your thoughts: Beeing afraid of abandonment is the norm for people suffering from bpd, but you probably know that already. A certain paranoia, thinking badly about other people and a generally negative world view is just as normal for someone with our diagnosis. Sadly, I cannot offer you much hope for these feelings to ever change, cause they probably won't. But that doesn't mean there is no hope for you at all. You can learn to endure these thoughts, in a sence of just sitting them out. With bpd we suffer from intense feelings, but time is on our side. 
Besides, you can use your skills, when things get to intense. But it will always be a fight for us to not act out on those feelings, to not accuse others because of our paranoia and to think about what we do before beeing toxic to others. I lost many friends to these feelings of paranoia and fear of abandonment. I sit here too, all day long, thinking and regreting mistakes of the past. But what often helps me, is thinking about the world and my place in it, how small I am and how little my feelings matter. After all, it can be quite healing to remind yourself from time to time, that noone cares how you feel and what you do. Maybe a hand full of people do here and there, but noone cares about them either in the bigger picture. There's a line from a song by Will Wood: ""At most a couple generations will remember the ways in which your life never mattered, so who cares if it's a waste"". That's kinda what saves me from falling too deep down the pit of worrying about my partner or my family.

Everything around us was made by people like you and me. Their causes and ideas live on.

You may look at the world out there, find out what you like about it and what you don't. And then just go and help change the things you don't like and support the ones you like. A lot of great things in history were made by average people who just didn't like things as they were (The 8 hour day, social security, democracy... the list is long).

1c97hti,"I feel ya. I often times find myself having those same exact thoughts but I really stop and think about it and try to approach it with logic. Should a person have a life of their own whilst they are in a relationship? ABSOLUTELY YES. And that goes both ways, I can have a life and go out and do stuff just the same as my boyfriend can, it is my decision not to do that most of the time so in reality I have nothing to complain about. Have they ever given me a reason to think they are being unfaithful? NO. So why worry about that? Why make up hurtful scenarios and make myself anxious when nothing is indicating that he is cheating? Is he drinking? If he is, who cares, he is doing that to himself, not me, it is his decision. If he enjoys it, why not indulge sometimes? I can do the same thing if I wish to, hell, I can even join him, but I choose not to.

The reality for me is that I really do like my alone time and before I got together with my boyfriend, being by myself was not an issue. Only now when I know that he is out there doing stuff without me, with the knowledge that I could be there with him, I get depressed about being ""left out"". But I am not actually being left out, sometimes, I just don't fit in and that is okay. He doesn't fit into a lot aspects of my life either and there is no reason to force it.

This illness is so stigmatized and misunderstood so that‚Äôs probably why you‚Äôre in disbelief. Try not to focus too much on the label but treatment. There are many disorders that benefit from the same therapy. The other thing is make sure you are not taking in every video on YouTube and reading articles online. Go to sites like National Institute of Mental Health or Nami (anything .org). Any doctor can write a book or make videos but it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs accurate information (their own knowledge) or reviewed by a team of experts (that have published many studies and have a plethora of experience). I can walk into a grocery store and buy homeopathic remedies for a problem I‚Äôm having but those treatments mage claims that have never been studied (are not FDA approved), have no long term data or potential adverse outcomes or the ingredients aren‚Äôt even screened. People read the label and are completely convinced yet when you look up the ingredients in medical journals, hundreds of studies have proved that the ingredients are ineffective or you‚Äôd have to take massive doses etc. Nami.org is another great source to educate family in your life. So many subs here are peoples opinions and support is great but don‚Äôt take everything as fact. Most folks with BPD have experienced trauma and BPD is a painful illness. It is natural when suffering and hurting (especially when it wasn‚Äôt your fault) to feel angry and blame xyz. I won‚Äôt use BPD because I don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings so take for example a spouse healing from being married to an NPD partner (not traits, actual disorder). They are adamant that their partner loved them and they know it. NPD don‚Äôt have emotional empathy or experience positive emotions. They don‚Äôt prey on empaths, that‚Äôs bs. They don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre sweet, a psychopath, fat, skinny whatever. They care about the 4 things: sex, supply (sadistic or narcissistic), services, and safety. Supply is all that matters and as long as one of these services are meet at any given time, they are fine. True NPD don‚Äôt want a caring, sweet person. They want someone to be mean to them (it‚Äôs a whole other explanation) that‚Äôs why they are so cruel to nice and caring people that don‚Äôt react poorly despite their abuse. So many comments you read, people understand the language and terms surrounding NPD but they apply experiences to match those terms and it‚Äôs way off. You experience BPD, before diagnosis would you say to a therapist: ‚ÄúI have dichotomous thinking‚Äù or ‚ÄúI fear intimacy‚Äù or ‚ÄúI tend to follow a relationship cycle where I idolize someone and then devalue and discard them‚Äù. That is not conscious and entirely absurd. If you knew, you wouldn‚Äôt be here. The same holds true for many disorders, like NPD and folks don‚Äôt understand because they are hurt and have suffered and we want accountability for what we are experiencing. It‚Äôs natural but don‚Äôt get so hung up on causes and things that keep you spiraling in negative ways. Focus on getting better. This isn‚Äôt a death sentence and with the right therapy (of course it takes a lot of motivation and hard work) the prognosis is actually very good (better than bipolar) but it‚Äôs not easy and requires a lot.

When I left my ex it wasn't over something specific or huge, it was an accumulation of things that left me feeling miserable and a knowledge that I had been emotionally abused for years.

All I can say is, make sure she understands that you believe you have changed your fundamental behaviour, and that you believe you can continue that long term, but you cannot force her to stay or try and guilt trip her, logic her, etc. it just doesn't work like that and even if you somehow convinced her to stay against her feelings this would happen again

1c891rj,"Cutting off an fp can be really upsetting, painful and hard. It also sometimes feels like the solution but isnt necessarily - ive thought about cutting off my fp but ultimately id end up emotionally close (and thus triggered) by someone else.

Id start my asking yourself what triggers your bpd with him? Is it actually *him* or is it having a fp/being close to someone/valuing someone so highly/not having other friends/etc. ? You cant fix the problem if you dont first identify precisely what it is. 

If it is him, then yeah cut off. Maybe a slow phase out would be more tolerable? But honestly its difficult either way and something Im not good at.

If its having a fp/other reason, then is getting rid of him fixing the issue or just avoiding the trigger? Can you avoid the trigger forever (eg. Never have a fp again, never be close to someone, etc)? If not, is there a benefit to avoiding it temporarily (eg. Crisis)? For me, avoiding a trigger doesnt help me learn to cope with that trigger. I can improve and heal to some degree, but if I want to improve my ability to be close to someone, its not going to happen when Im alone. So I guess just ..work out what exactly needs changing and whether that is truly best addressed without your current fp.

It sounds here like you were triggered unexpectedly. And that stuff happens. When our minds have sudden shocks like that, we can convince ourselves of the strangest thing.

1c7oaao,"I'll run through the DSM criteria and describe how I meet them. (Might be useful in case my current therapist joins the throngs of many I've had who disregard my diagnosis and insist I'm too self-aware to have it.)

**Chronic feelings of emptiness**

This one is pretty self-explanatory. I feel very empty inside. If anyone has seen *Inside Out*, imagine if Riley never got back Joy or Sadness, and was only generally capable of feeling Anger, Disgust, and Fear. I also desperately hate myself.

**Emotional instability in reaction to day-to-day events (e.g., intense episodic sadness, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days)**

This one is hard to suss out because I also have bipolar disorder, but I do have mood swings.

**Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment**

I do this more on an episodic basis. If I'm in crisis with a partner, and they (understandably) want to leave, I am liable to do anything to make them stay and (probably unsuccessfully) help me regulate.

**Identity disturbance with markedly or persistently unstable self-image or sense of self**

I don't have a terrific sense of who I am. I regularly change my clothing style and mask my behaviors and image to others. Then again, I am also autistic--as I think a lot of people who develop BPD are--and these are masking symptoms of autism as well.

**Impulsive behavior in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating)**

This one is tricky for me, because I am successfully in remission from alcohol use disorder, but I was a serious alcoholic for several years. I have lately had some issues controlling spending, mostly with clothing (see above), and I struggle to reduce my speed driving.

**Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights)**

This is big for me. I used to abuse and harm partners physically and emotionally. I have given myself concussions from headbanging. I go from 0 to 100 with my anger sometimes and always have, even as a kid.

**A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by extremes between idealization and devaluation (also known as ""splitting"")**

This one is perhaps the saddest for me to report. I have never had an adult romantic relationship that didn't involve terrible fights and conflict, and I have never felt loved by my partners, even in the face of obvious demonstration that they do.

**Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats, or self-harming behavior**

I have made multiple attempts on my life and have self-harmed since about age 12 or 13.

**Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms**

I have a lot of phobias and paranoia, although this might be more of an anxiety symptom.",Traumarama79,False,1713530422.0

I'm impulsive in my thoughts and feelings, I'll get myself so down if my partner happens to be talking to another woman more often than usual, and even if she's a platonic friend. 

I self harm a lot. Bully myself. Get extremely overwhelmed to the point of crying if altercations happen with appointments that impact my work. If I can't sleep. It's so disruptive.",Then_Advertising6254,False,1713530817.0
1c7oaao,"All of them. Every symptom affects everything I do to some extent, both in positive and/or negative ways. I'm much more assertive with calling out shitty behavior in comparison to before i developed bpd, but that in turn also makes me more aggressive and unforgiving, seeking revenge and/or holding ""grudges"" for years. (I say grudge in quotes bc the things ive been livid over are things nobody else would forgive either, but i will ruminate about said grudge every. Single. Day. For years. Constantly. Even if i act like I'm not angry).

I'm certainly far more social than before developinf bpd. I know exactly when i developed the disorder, and before I did, i had cptsd, which made me quite antisocial and reclusive, yet comfortable with it. Now, being alone for more than 30 minutes drives the thought that im a total loser. I must hang out with at least one person every single day to keep my brain from going down that hole.

Some symptoms are only apparent certain days of the week, and being on meds/therapy reduces meltdowns by half, but the self loathing, rumination, fear of betrayal, suicidal thoughts, fear of being unloved, yet feeling undeserving of any sort of love, and feeling so subhuman that you question if you're even a true homo sapien and not some weird, worthless evolutionary offshoot is a constant, 25/7, never ending cycle, every second of my life.",smilingboss7,False,1713536309.0
1c7oaao,"I meet most of the formal criteria in some capacity, but the ones I struggle with the most are emotional instability, anger issues and unstable sense of self.
My emotional instability shows itself through intense, inappropriate and unforseeable mood swings, which is both hard on my mental health as well as the people around me when they happen. I can go from super happy and calm to extremely angry or deeply depressed and anxious over the tiniest of things.
Which is where the anger issues kind of tie in, I get uncontrollably angry over the silliest, most insignificant things on a seemingly random basis. I have fairly good control over them now and externally, it only presents as irritability and bad mood, whereas around ten years ago, I used to lash out verbally and physically. Both against myself and other people.
My unstable sense of self used to present as me going through roughly 5 wildly different personalities and looks per year because I never felt like what I was showing to the world was truly me - because I never knew who that ‚Äûme‚Äú really was. I only started kind of piecing together who I am and how I want to be 2 years ago, and while I‚Äòm still not nearly done, I think I‚Äòve made some progress on that.
All this has little to no impact on my work, a small impact on my friends and a huge impact on my partner and very close friends. My symptoms are basically invisible to people I‚Äòm not close with and get more noticeable as people get closer to me.",porcelainsuffering,False,1713539627.0

1c7oaao,"I developed it in 2020 when an ex of mine cheated and ghosted me to be with his ex, 2 months after we moved into an apartment together. I had already been suffering persistently with both childhood trauma and relationship trauma at that point, definitely had cptsd, but my psychiatrist at that time knew i didn't have bpd. I know i didnt either, i was far from being mentally unstable like I am today. I was 23 at the time, and my brain just fucking snapped in half when i caught him. I saw all the red flags even on our first date, but his treatment towards me, his manipulation and gaslighting was so blinding that i thought everything was healthy and that I was just overthinking about his obsession with that ex. Post break up, he persistently tried using excuses to make his cheating seem justified and made a lot of people view me as a crazy ex. I was constantly on high alert with fear over him talking horribly about me. His friends are also extremely toxic and into drug culture, which affected me severely post-break up, and tons of horrible drama ensued, resulting in me cutting off that group of friends, and always trying to seek a similar friend group with the same party/drug cultures, thinking that's what most people are like. Instead I found tons of very healthy, normal friends who don't do drugs, which actually drives me insane because i WANT friends to do drugs with. Unfortunately because I moved from my home state, I cant see my usual friends daily, but I have a few friends where I currently live, but, we only hang once a week. My coworkers are definitely considered friends since we goof off and get along well, but i never hang with them outside of work, so, 4-5 days a week is what I typically do realistically. Outside of that, my fiance is who i spend most of my time with, everyday. I have absolutely no fear or lack of trust with any sort of infidelity because he's never given me any red flags like my ex did. He was cheated on as well, totally understands my pain, and although has no understanding of bpd, knows how to keep me comfortable, safe, and loved, even if i dont feel any of it. To this day i persistently beat myself to a pulp over dating that ex and desperately want to prove to him that he's the one who's in the wrong, and not me. I've never been angrier at anyone in my whole entire life, and I even have an ex who beat and raped me daily. Despite all that, there's been no legit communication with that ex ever since, no desire to seek forgiveness ever since i kicked him out the door, seems there never will be again, and I'm left to pick up the whole mess for myself. Bruh actually gave me brain damage, i stg. Even posting this explanation scares me bc I'm expecting this to come back and bite me in the ass for being open about it, because he used to beg me not to tell people about what he did. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",smilingboss7,False,1713540777.0
