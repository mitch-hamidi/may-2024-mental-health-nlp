1cvvpqr,"I get it, pretty much every one of my relationships have ended with weird off and on again hookups 

That said, it does end up hurting and preventing the healing from starting. It would probably be more helpful to stop hooking up, and to limit weed use to just evenings for a bit. Can set a time and not allow yourself to get cooked before then, as long as you‚Äôre steady with the amount you‚Äôre using should be fine. Not easy but doable

Plus blaming ourselves for being shitty in relationships doesn‚Äôt help anyone. We can and will feel bad about it, but that doesn‚Äôt matter unless we make changes. Are you in therapy? Are you actively working on getting better? Are you taking mistakes you‚Äôve made and applying them towards lessons to learn?

1cvvpqr,Ok apparently I also shouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm hyper sexual on here or 34 yr old men will try to take advantage AHHHH I HATE THE WORLD,VastIntelligent569,True,1716147785.0
1cvvpqr,"Lmao my ex did the same with me, and the guy before me. She was still hooking up with her ex while just getting started with me, and now we‚Äôve hit the full cycle and I became the ex she‚Äôs hooking up with (unknowingly, I thought we were working on things.) Just don‚Äôt let it reach that point, and maybe try to find a new hobby to distract you from those thoughts. I don‚Äôt have bpd, but my ex does, and my ex before her did as well. Things like this can get very messy, as you still crave the attention of the ex, as well as the new person. 

My advice would be to immediately go no contact with your ex. You‚Äôre blurring your perspective of relationships and how they should be by hooking up with your ex while also attempting to look for another relationship. 

You don‚Äôt need substances to grieve. The only way out is through, and if you don‚Äôt allow yourself to feel these emotions, you won‚Äôt be able to move on. Restrain from black and white thinking ‚Äúhe‚Äôs all bad‚Äù vs ‚Äúhe‚Äôs all good.‚Äù Focus on what you did wrong in the relationship instead. Focus on what you can improve for the next one, and focus on what you want to avoid in the next one as well.

1cvvpqr,"This is exactly what happened after my breakup with my current boyfriend (we got back together). If we hadn‚Äôt gotten back together, I honestly dread to think about the hole I would have dug myself by seeking comfort and validation in being high and sleeping with others, as opposed to taking care of the thing that matters which is my mind and body. I literally put everything on the back burner and made getting back together with him a priority, and smoked through the pain I was putting myself through, I lost 8kg and you know what? Our relationship didn‚Äôt get back together on a great note, and I‚Äôm still unhappy because I didn‚Äôt take care of myself properly. Being high is fine in the moment, but you feel so much lower sober than you would be if you never smoked. Like, just stop. Stop smoking weed, stop hooking up with him, stop hooking up with people all together - go no contact, grieve the relationship, feed your body with healthy homemade meals and go running to distract yourself instead, and before you know it, you won‚Äôt have to distract yourself anymore.

For us with BPD, sometimes loving someone means recognizing that we took them through our hurricane of a life and they need space from the storm. We can love them by growing and learning to live steadier away from them

1cvuzw4,"My no.1 would be also that my friends could disengage and not take it personally because i am not myself anymore. 


On top of that for me its that i am actually trying to take responsibility for my actions in the past, but sometimes it is hard to recreate what i said or did while in an Episode. 
I would get loud, use harmful words, break stuff, and mock people and just cant remember everything afterwards. 
I know i hurt everybody in this mental state, i know ‚Äûthe person‚Äú destroying everything has my face and my voice, but often it doesnt feel like i get a choice on freaking out or not. It mostly just happens and i‚Äòll go into blind verbal ugly hurtful rage even though i dont want to. 
And when its over i feel like the worst kind of human and drown in shame for treating the people i love so hatefully. 

It drains my energy and it feels like you wake up from a nightmare - stressed and confused AF.
That makes it very hard to talk about what really happened and to apologize authentically. 
I went off via Text a lot an it scared me how much of another person i am while having Episodes after reading it a few days later. I can not regognize that i went off like that level of harmful, almost like some evil twin trying to ruin your life. 

So if my loved ones could see that i am honestly sorry for not being able to emotionally regulate myself sometimes and that Borderline scares the sh.t out of me too - that would take at least in my world a lot of tension out of social interactions. 

And the last thing i could add is, that when i am constantly asking weird questions like, do you still want to be with me etc. Its not because i am thinking bad of you, its because i cant fight the doubtful Thought-Carousell alone right now and i simply want reassurance to stop it more easily.

1cvuzw4,"I think you will get some indicators everytime. 
My FP said im starting to have difficulties finding words, and i rub my hands or fingers and cant maintain good eye contact. My whole Bodylanguage changes into being uncomfortable and wanting to leave. 

I would guess generally if you just feel tension building up in the Person with BPD or in your conversation, thats usually a strong sign. 
But what someone does under tension is individual. 

Easiest solution for me was to tell all people near me they should notice me when im acting strange or getting nervous, so i can check for myself if im sliding into an episode. 
Most of the time i realise it way too late, so this helps me of reducing the damage which comes with Episodes. 
If someone said it to me i would say typically thank you and leave for 5 minutes to really check if they could be right and if i am overteacting. 
This saved so many Conversations from being a total desaster. 

Most of the time i would apologize and be much mor calm afterwards, so there was no need anymore for disengaging because of my behavior. 
Also i told them, when i would go into rage mode anyways afterwards, please just stand up and leave and say ‚Äûi dont want to be yelled at, lets have this conversation later‚Äú - because nobody has to sit down while being treated badly. 

But please be aware, that you make sure it is okay to tell the person with BPD when you think they struggle. 
Like have a talk about it BEFORE you say ‚Äûmaybe you are overreacting‚Äú - otherwise i guess most ppl with BPD would feel attacked and thats fuel for the big boom.

1cvuyor,"BPD is a spectrum so on top of every other warning on here about labeling everyone pwBPD the same, that is important to keep in mind. As is everyone's experience and how they handle their life and living with it as they move forward.

Some people out of their intense fears will yes take it to those lengths. Usually what you are seeing when it is represented in pop culture. Some people live through their partners, some go to desperate lengths to please, some test to see if they stay and some create out right lies to make that attachment. Again, people are different and how they respond, even those with BPD. 

What is similar about pwBPD is your ex and you can read through these boards and seeing people who are suicidal over losing their own partners stems from something in their upbringing that broke how the development of how healthy relationships work and their own emotions toward them. What their subconcious or BPD then does to ""protect"" them then varies. You can obviously find some common types of groups within how that is handled and what you encountered is one of those. 

However, I would stop short of saying it is a more aggressive form -- it's just a form here she is working more on controlling her emotions by being proactive in how she approaches and uses relationships --- unlike again those who here end up being way more reactive. It's just as aggressive if you want to use that term when it leads someone to be afraid of leaving their house because of how someone looks at them. It's just that BPD and who it hurts ends up turning inward more than what happened to you.",MainAction9667,False,1716144589.0
1cvuxte,"First of all I appreciate you leaving out all the negative things he said, not that it's right, but it's refreshing to see someone on a BPD board who realizes they were saying mean shit cause that's how they deal with their own issues and while he may be unhealthy in that respect it does judge his entire character. But having BPD and being your age yourself, you understand all that.

43m here. Was married for 10 years, had another 5-year relationship. You're describing the beginning of the end of a relationship. There's relationship malaise like every long term relationship has --- and you can try to fix and repair that way by setting up some actual date nights, times you set aside for your own BBQ with your partner.

But you seem to be putting together it goes a lot deeper than that. It's important to realize despite your efforts, despite both of your own unhealthy aspects of what mental stuff you have going on, you are both good people. You probably had great times at first, but you have settled into this routine. You are wanting to change for the better, but your partner doesn't. Unhealthy people stay with unhealthy people because they both benefit, because neither has to do the really hard thing -- which is the change. It sucks, there are long periods of being lonely, there's horrible self-reflection and you have to start over. It's easier just to go day to day as you two are doing, almost just roommates at this point.

And you can not force that change onto him. In his head, what he is doing is working. I'm sure he would like to stop fighting with you so much as well, but what he has going with you includes a solid foundation of where to go every night, he gets his time with friends, he gets sex on occasion and what he subconsciously likes is that he doesn't have to face his own shit and change.

I've been him and I've been you. And being the former he will not make any changes until it's taken away from him. And even then any changes will not be for himself to make his life better, it will be done out of desperation to keep this structure that he has built in tact.

You mentioned a son, so you have him to think about as well. But what you describe is a situation you know needs change to make you happy or you just adjusting to enjoy what you can out of the whole thing as you separate even more emotionally from your partner.",MainAction9667,False,1716145419.0

1cvr7or,"FPs are someone you emotionally live through. You regulate your emotions based on how you perceive their emotions are at the time. You put them on a pedestal, they can do no wrong. Until they say or do one little thing that you disagree with and then you split on them and they are the worst person in the world. The relationship however is actually with yourself. Instead of focusing on managing your own emotions, on what makes you happy, you sad, you focus on the FP. It's a way of shielding oneself from dealing with their own emotions. It's like an imaginary friend, but one that is projected on a living person. You are almost using this person to represent yourself, which is why there are the high pedestal moments an the low loathing moments.

Co-dependency the person relies on the caregiver to provide all the emotional support to them. The person has to be there, it's up to the caregiver to do everything for the person. They are like a teddy bear robot. One that you need to feel safe, but also does all the things that you need. Not knowing where your teddy bear is or not having access to it would cause what you said. It also takes 2 to tangle in this situation as the caregiver usually has his own form of dependency issues. Which is what you are describing with the father making his life around your friend.

The FP has to be happy for you to be happy. While the other one, you need that person just around so you can be happy.

They are similar and those with BPD often have dependency issues and those with dependency disorder have BPD traits. They both involve an unhealthy relationship with another person. Is he always talking about how great his Dad is, how his Dad can do no wrong, how he's so cool, does he relate EVERYTHING to what his Dad would feel about it. Thats a FP.

Needing his Dad around constantly and having his Dad do everything for him or he's not regulated is co-dependency.

1cvqoar,"well if you have symptoms of bpd, you can try to see if you can get your hands on dbt materials. that's like the first line of defense for bpd usually, but it'll also help even if you don't have bpd but struggle with things like intense emotions or impulsive behavior. it's not likely you would be diagnosed until you are an adult anyway, because you're not supposed to diagnose younger people with personality disorders",i_hate_sex_666,False,1716134603.0
1cvqoar,"Growing up my parents always advocated for therapy since they knew genetic mental disorders ran HEAVILY within the bloodline. I‚Äôve seen countless doctors, psychologists, therapists and counselors. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety before I turned 13, and by your age I kept fumbling with the idea of BPD, cPTSD, Bipolar, and the rest of the similar disorders that sometimes blur together. I was diagnosed with BPD at 18, i‚Äôm now 20. 

I say all of this to say, even if you don‚Äôt have BPD but still feel the similar symptoms, you should know that the most healing comes from practicing mindfulness and self regulation. Healthy coping mechanisms, being able to recognize your own triggers, and being able to process your feelings without hostility towards yourself for feeling them in the first place. 

What‚Äôs helped me with my relationships is setting boundaries and being completely honest with myself and them. For example, keeping friendships is hard for me because I get so sucked in to the person I feel as though I have to spend ALL my time with them just so they don‚Äôt get bored and leave. I break this down internally, and realize I do this because abandonment is a huge trigger of mine, to the point i do not helpful things (like smothering a friend) in fear of being left, which causes both me and that person to become burnt out or fatigued, and in an attempt to regain myself, i‚Äôd go ghost and lose that friend. This cycle would repeat until i set better boundaries for myself, telling myself ‚ÄúI know i‚Äôm excited to talk to this person, but i‚Äôm feeling a little bit more drained today so maybe i should spend some time doing things i enjoy by myself or with other people.‚Äù 

You‚Äôre going to have days where it fees like the world is crushing you under its weight. Like your brain might go up in flames from the racing thoughts. Take it day by day, don‚Äôt be harsh on yourself. Practice taking small steps. Here‚Äôs a quick list of things that help me when my emotions are heavily fluctuating: 

- If i‚Äôm manic, I make sure I keep my breathing calm, and I tell myself to properly spread out my energy to keep myself aligned with my, and others, boundaries. 

- if i‚Äôm deeply depressed, i allow myself to feel. to cry, to hide under my blankets. i distract myself with healthy things, like watching comfort movies, making comfort foods, or listening to positive affirmations asmr if i feel like a movie/show would be too loud and overstimulating 

- if i‚Äôm unreasonably angry or feel as though ive been triggered into/close to a split, i make sure every stimulus is lowered as my immediate reaction would be to want to listen to loud angry music, though that would only validate and feed the anger. instead i find something to work the anger out on safely. chewing on something soft, squeezing slime as hard as i can, or scribbling on a page and not stopping until the entire page is covered or until i‚Äôve calmed down (usually i calm down before the page is full) 

I hope at least some of this was helpful. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre unable to get diagnosed, but you can still take steps to keep yourself regulated. With or without BPD, you can maintain friendships and relationships, it just takes a little extra work and capacity to rationalize intense emotions. You got this!!",lickinleather,False,1716136163.0

I would look into the wise mind technique. I would start a daily journal. A verbal journal is extra helpful for me. I often find myself talking in circles, while also realizing within the session that I should be trying to show others AND myself more grace, I'll go against what I initially said or work through it, without having to drag anyone else into this extremely emotionally exhausting mental process.

Be of service to others. Go volunteer anywhere you can. Even in daily interactions, try to be more helpful. This is an odd way to feel seen and validated while helping other living beings at the same time. 

Start reading some books on BPD. 

You mentioned you are in control of your thoughts. That's not always true. You are in control of your actions and reactions. You can work through your thoughts so that in time, they will change. I don't choose to wake up and think ""you're a messy selfish worthless piece of shit"". But I do choose to say ""no. I am a human living with BPD, CPTSD, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and possibly ADHD/Autism. I'm different. It is a challenge. But I deserve to live. I want to help others. I want to help myself. Today I will do my best. And sometimes your best is just living through the day"". And go from there. No one is perfect. Not ourselves nor others. Our BPD brain so badly wants to see the world and people in black or white/ good or bad terms. And it's just not so. So much is a gray area. Our brain wants to split, on others and ourselves. This is our opportunity to redirect ourselves. Stop. Verbal journal. Talk it out. WiseMind technique. Journal again. Whatever you need to do to encourage your brain to see all the sides even if it doesn't like it or fully agree with it. That's ok. Keep redirecting yourself.

Forgive yourself. Learn to show yourself and others grace. Imagine seeing someone else talk to another human in the way you talk to yourself and others. Does it make you feel good or no?

Also seems that he‚Äôs read into BPD too and understands it to the best of his ability. Seems he can do better, but he can‚Äôt read minds. Explain what he could do that might help with this rumination, but Do Do Do try to keep this solution a balance between empathy, sympathy and logic. Too much logic will result in more situations like this and eventually the fear of abandonment. Too much sympathy and empathy will turn into a fear of engulfment. Everyone with BPD is different, everyone without it is different too! That makes all of us the same haha. So cater the solution by ear. Most importantly, communicate as much as possible your feelings, either when they‚Äôre happening, or afterwards when everything soothes out. For example, where it‚Äôs located within your body (stomach, head, hands, etc.) If it also helps, maybe give these feelings a name and mention the name to him when it‚Äôs happening?

Chances are he's actually still hurting a lot inside too after such a conversation, but I believe he's doing this, especially asking 100 times to say something silly/goofy, cause he cares/loves you. He IS showing how much he cares for you and how much the relationship means to him! He's a good guy! Hold onto him. He‚Äôs working with what he thinks will help perhaps because he‚Äôs seen how happy it makes you with these things he brings up, before, in the past. Hold onto him!

Regardless, meet him half way and I'm more than sure he will do the same! Everything will get better, friend. Dw!

  
Final Edit: Maybe also steer away from noting down so much with the notebook. Has it really helped? Or has it kept these memories more alive? Do these memories provide joy? Or is it self-harm? I would suggest shifting this notebook towards something more beneficial to our well-being.  Use it as a tool for change. Make all of this brief, without as much detail as usual: Note down the conversation to it's core (1-2 sentences), the main points that were brought up between you and your bf,  how what he said felt, how he reacted (with physical cues, motions of his face, etc. and ask him how he felt). Finally, write down where it went it right? If something really went wrong, how it could have been handled differently?

1cvldld,"For distractions. I clean, deep clean, OCD like clean. Until I'm so exhausted I can't think. If you're still thinking, you haven't cleaned enough. Clean your car, organize your drawers, make everything like.... picturesque clean and organized. Walks are good. Long walks are better. I walk until my legs are like jelly. Verbal journal. I hit record on my phone and talk until I cant form anymore thoughts verbally. Great practice, you might catch yourself talking in circles, verbalizing a different outlook than you did initially. Actually writing or typing out your thoughts. Sometimes I'll write the same thing over and over until it means nothing. Sounds weird. Don't do this with people's names, this seems to cement them into my brain more like an incantation. 

Drink water amongst doing the above. Half an ounce for each pound of bodyweight. Being dehydrated can cause a feeling of panic and unease. While your mind is trying to obsess over the person, interrupt yourself and go drink water. Track it. Make sure you're meeting your water goal every day. 

Start a self care routine and incorporate more if your mind is still focused on something you don't want it to focus on. Brush your teeth morning and night, and after you eat. Skincare routine morning and night. Take your vitamins or buy some vitamins or probiotics. Make it a point to take them daily. Exfoliate your whole body. Lotion. Paint your toenails or go get them done. Then maintain them. Start a light workout or stretching routine. Something easy and mindless you can just distract yourself with. I like push-ups and various leglifts at my kitchen counter. Start a nail routine. 

Deep dive into anything listed above. Become a master of your domain and your body.

1cvk2eu,"Medication doesn't fix mood swings from BPD. For BPD medication is only used to treat symptoms, such as prolonged depression, some anxiety issues, that part.

It's a personality disorder, and one built around shielding oneself from emotions. The only way someone will get better is if they want it themselves. If you push someone with BPD, they will figure out a way to end the relationship. Even if you aren't pushing them and their subconscious senses that they need to get better to make it work, they will figure out a way to end the relationship.

The only way someone will ever address their own ""personality"" is because of their own need and finally realizing that their own pattern of behavior needs to be changed.

""Quiet BPD"" can be purely functional, but at that stage they are not EVER going to seek help. They are doing there best to try to move forward without having to go to the dark places in their head they will have to go to fix themselves. They can go a long time, but eventually it will come out and that BPD won't be so quiet or directed inward for much longer.

There are plenty of success stories, but I'm letting you know up front they come from the person themselves hitting rock bottom enough times to make the change on their own.

I can't stress enough BPD, and especially Quiet, the whole thing is to HIDE, SHIELD and PROTECT oneself from having to deal with those emotions.

1cvij26,"Obviously, are you in treatment? If you aren't, this would actually be a massive possibility to salvaging therelationship, but stay level headed and don't dry yourself up for disappointment. If you are, the symptoms sound or if control enough to commit to a higher like of care and this incident signifies that it's time toi take it more seriously. This. Is. Your. Life. On. The. Line

Get into an IOP or a PHP, you self harmed, go to the psych ward. Any of the three, just report to a higher level of care REGARDLESS of your relationship status, YOU need this. You need to stop being codependent if you wish to massively reduce your suffering and learn to do things because you love yourself first and not because you love someone else first. The relationship bouncing back would be a bonus, for now give him space and, honest to goodness, it really doesn't hurt to just google how to take accountability. Show remorse, but don't grovel and be self centric and take up the entire spotlight with an incessant amount of remorse. 

We often feel like we're incredibly empathetic, and that is true, but at the same time we're often considered by others to lack empathy. It's tricky to understand until you learn that we have two kinds of empathy, cognitive and emotional empathy. One to navigate someone's emotional state accurately when applying it to situational awareness and the other to accurately gauge that emotional state. With BPD, the cognitive empathy, the ability to apply situational empathy, is severely impaired, however emotional empathy is heightened, when we DO see or get it, we fucking FEEEEL it. So there's a tendency to wash away ther validation a orthopedic needs to feel when taking a leaky floor the wrong you've done to them when you or I've gone off the deep end with the emotional empathy basically living the experience in our head and feel so sorry we now need comforted, but we wronged them.

Sorry that was a bit of a tangent... iiiin any case, those symptoms need checked, this conditions is so much more treatable than most people know. Remission isn't just possible it is the likely course. Do yourself a favor, don't wait for it to come to you. And trauma is a key component to the disorder, so it would suffice to say processing your trauma is going to be a key component to remission. And don't expect one PHP or IOP to be the cure. I did kind of fumble in ther dark and take the long way around, but i think alot of us do. I've done at least 6 IOP programs.  And im about to do a 7th. Though for once, for the first time, it's not for BPD yyaaaay!

You are not your diagnosis, you never will be, it is only words, a label, you are already whole and complete, you are already enough, you have always been enough, and if you don't feel like you're enough then just be. Let the moment pass without taking it to a negative place, try to shoot for excluding value based judgements all together honestly. It's the disorder, the condition, that places barriers and blinders over you always preventing only you, just you, from seeing your perception of yourself, but it's there, it's ALWAYS there, everyone can see it, if you didn't have a personality of your own there wouldn't be anything to disorder, it's just been very busy for many years permanently flipped on to survival mode . And you are not empty, this is just a perceptual disturbance, it is only a perception, it is a cognitive shift.  Your cognition can be shifted in other directions. The last thing you are is empty, yo√π probably have so so much to unburden, so so much love to give, and loads more charisma and personality that you've had to unfairly lock away for far too long.

You know got deserve it all right? Yeah, that. Yes, that, yep that exact thing, yes, aaaaall that stuff, aaaaall of it. There's nothing you want that you don't deserve. You were born with every fleck if intrinsic value as the next child and you haven't lost a speck along your journey. If you're not in intensive treatment please seek it, for pwBPD who initial to recommended treatment guidelines there's is an over 50% remission rate just with the first 24 months.

Check out some more stats on n some longitudinal studies following pwBPD after they recieved the diagnosis, this was regardless of treatment or life circumstances le substance abuse le addition fal trauma, etc etc. Just a mix bag of diagnosed pwBPD:

when followed up 2 years after the initial assessment, about one-quarter of patients experience a remission of the diagnosis during the prior 2 years

During a 10-year period of follow-up, 91% achieve at least a 2-month remission, with 85% achieving remission for 12 months or longer.

The MSAD has found similar results(different remission criteria, absence of symptoms for 2 years or more) extended out to 16 years and found that by 16 years, 99% of patients have at least a 2-year period of remission and 78% have a remission lasting 8 years.

Finally, 1 study followed patients after 27 years and found that 92% of them no longer met criteria for BPD.

Pain is unavoidable, suffering is optional. Making therapy effective is a learning curve. You have to sit with your discomfort and challenge yourself, when you want to run away, that is your cue to get to work, that's when it's time to put the therapy hat on, this is where you must go. I promise if you only just listen to these couple words only, because i definitely fucking am baked and am nooot sleeping tonigt(this morning) and rambled so bad, you'll begin to feel unburdened within a few weeks.

Neither, nor both of which would, cause an immediate improvement, but WILL show a commitment to take action to bring about real change to yourself.

1cvhx85,"> Has anyone else recounted an event with someone and had totally different recollections?

Yes, it's not uncommon for people to have different recollections of the same event. Our memories can be influenced by our emotions, thought process, and even our mental health conditions.

Have you experienced this kind of discrepancy in memory with other people as well, or has it mainly just been with your boyfriend?

>For reference, this is not the first time I've heard something like this and I've also had numerous rage blackouts (which I always remember and understand I did that). Am I being gaslit?

Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation where someone makes you question your reality. Have you noticed a pattern of your boyfriend consistently denying your reality or making you feel like your perceptions are always wrong?

>Today my boyfriend was kind of in a mood. He's admitted and apologized in the past that often he can be grumpy and abrasive and overall standoffish. Well today he seemed to be in that mood.

It sounds like your boyfriend has recognized his grumpy and abrasive behavior before, which is a good first step. However, if this mood is affecting your interactions frequently, it might be worth bringing up how it impacts you and your relationship.

How do you usually handle it when he gets into these moods?

>On the way to Lowes I started brainstorming what I could give my most recent client as a gift, of course he disagreed (abrasively) with most of what I suggested, but I felt I was pleasant enough in light of his mood, etc. Well when we pulled into the lowes parking lot, he suddenly turned to me and practically started yelling about how I was in the conversation, that I'm always in such and such mood etc. I was caught off guard with this and honestly hurt, I didn't think anything had gone wrong.

I imagine you must feel hurt and confused by his reaction. When you're trying to have a positive conversation and it turns into an argument, it's very jarring. Have you been able to discuss what triggered his outburst after the fact when all has calmed down?

>Well tonight he told me I said that he ""thinks I'm some dumb bitch"" IN the conversation and freaked out on him. For reference, I have bpd, ocd, bipolar, and anxiety, I'm a very emotional being if you can imagine. But I have ZERO recollection of his recounting of it, and it honestly feels like he was misinterpreting all my behaviors UNTIL he said I said this shit that 100% I didn't fucking say, or at least, don't remember.

Given your conditions, it's possible that intense emotions can sometimes cloud your memory. However, it's also crucial to consider whether his version of events might be influenced by his own emotions and perceptions.

I think the most robust solution is to explore these incidents in therapy, both individually and together, to better understand what might be happening. Individual therapy can equip you with tools to manage your emotions and understand your experiences better. Couples therapy could possibly improve your communication and understanding of each other‚Äôs perspectives.

Also, I encourage you to keep a journal of your interactions and emotions so you can spot patterns and perceive a clearer picture of events. It's important to approach this situation with compassion for yourself and a willingness to explore these experiences further.",ladyhaly,False,1716102773.0

""The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment"" by Eckhart Tolle is a spiritual guidebook that emphasizes the importance of living in the present moment. Here are the key themes and concepts explored in the book:

1. **The Importance of the Present Moment**: Tolle argues that much of human suffering stems from being overly focused on the past or the future. He emphasizes that the only true reality is the present moment and encourages readers to fully engage with the ""now"" to achieve peace and enlightenment.
2. **Ego and the False Self**: The book delves into the concept of the ego, which Tolle describes as the part of the mind that constructs an identity based on thoughts and experiences. He believes that the ego leads to a false sense of self and is the source of negative emotions and thoughts.
3. **Mindfulness and Awareness**: Tolle teaches techniques for becoming more mindful and aware of the present moment. This includes observing one's thoughts and feelings without judgment and recognizing that they are separate from one's true self.
4. **Transcending the Ego**: Tolle provides strategies for transcending the ego and finding a deeper, more authentic sense of self. This involves disidentifying from the mind and its incessant stream of thoughts and cultivating a state of presence and inner stillness.
5. **Pain-Body**: The book introduces the concept of the ""pain-body,"" which is an accumulation of old emotional pain. Tolle explains how the pain-body can dominate a person's thoughts and behavior, and offers ways to dissolve it through conscious awareness.
6. **Inner Peace and Acceptance**: A significant part of the book is dedicated to teaching acceptance of the present moment, regardless of its challenges. Tolle suggests that resistance to what is causes suffering, and acceptance leads to inner peace.
7. **Spiritual Awakening**: The ultimate goal of the practices Tolle describes is to experience a spiritual awakening. This awakening is characterized by a profound sense of peace, joy, and a connection to a deeper reality beyond the physical and mental realms.

""The Power of Now"" has been widely praised for its ability to help readers understand and apply mindfulness and presence in their daily lives.

If you have BPD and you are prone to letting your emotions dictate your behavior-- when your chemicals are out of balance you may tend to push further with those good feelings or detach during the downs. So if you were unfortunate enough to have the chemical imbalance, you're going to make either mood swing last longer one way or another.

There's also a large difference between bipolar I and II. I think BPD and bipolar are like 40 percent comorbid, but like only 10 percent of that is bipolar I. Bipolar I is the one that usually leads to hospitalization for the manic episodes. While bipolar II has less intense manic episodes, but can have longer depression periods.

The combination tends to have those with Quiet BPD mislabeled as bipolar at first, because the first real BPD monster episodes usually occur after a manic episode. But it's usually the BPD monster finally creeping out and making itself public when the person has let their guard down and in a dont give a fuck mood cause of the manic aspect. And because it's out of character. So it takes a pattern emerging and someone experienced enough to separate the two.

Your symptoms described might point towards a possible personality disorder. The caveat to that is personality disorders don't ever go away. Your personality is forever altered, and when working with vulnerable people, this can fuel the cycle of helpless/hopelessness.

I think what would benefit you is picking one symptom at a time and focusing on ways in which to treat that specific symptom. Working with a therapist, psychologist, counselor, or other can provide extra support and help you acquire skills you might not think of or find on your own.

1cvgvud,"I understand.  Been there a million times over again. I got a lifecoach a few years ago ($200 an hour), and she was like, ""Babe, you have Borderline personality disorder."" and I was like, ""Girl, tf?""

I grieved a lot. I was angry at her about it because BPD is very, very debilitating. I told her that I was angry at her but that I realized how silly it was because she just wanted to help me understand myself better. She thanked me for being honest with her, and I instantly felt better after that interaction. She honored my emotions, allowing me the space to feel what I felt and not changing it.

I had to be honest with myself, too. I was unstable all the time. I went to her because I was at my witts end and was seriously going to kms if I didn't get help. She saw that and took the time to encourage me to do things for myself.

The most helpful thing she had me do was inner child work. It is as simple as sitting down in a quiet space without any distractions and visualizing myself as a child. She gave me three things to say to my inner child:

- I see you
- I am here for you
- I love you

Beginning the process of reparenting myself was not perfect. I would lose my temper time and time again. Catching myself mid-outburst, realizing I was having an out of proportion reaction to circumstances. I felt completely unhinged and fucking psychotic.

Something that really has helped me, I have been doing this for years, is box breathing. It's the easiest thing to do when I am having a panic attack. Sometimes I have to do it for 45 minutes to 2 hours without stopping because my natural instinct is to breathe quickly causing a spike in my heart rate, and this can trigger my panic attacks even if I'm not thinking about anything troubling. And, I might stop too soon before I've had a chance to let my emotions pass, sending me back to that roller-coaster ride of thoughts and feelings.

Sometimes, I get so focused on if I'm even breathing correctly or if my heart is beating hard enough that I go into a panic attack. ü§£ I can laugh about it because it's such a silly thing I do, and I know plenty of people who this also happens to.

When I am having a conversation, and I feel my heartbeat pick up, I focus only on my breathing. I stop listening altogether. I literally don't care to even reply to the person. I just breathe. I will tell them I need a moment to reset, and that I might need some time to myself before continuing this conversation. It might not be something serious at all, I might be triggered by the other person's emotional reaction to whatever they are talking about, so focusing on those box breaths helps a lot to keep me relaxed and calm.

I call anxiety the great lie, like the story of Adam and Eve, and the snake is so convincing. Anxiety is the snake. It is the doubt. The 'what if'.

I will be box breathing, a boa constricter slithers in, and I suddenly hear it whisper ""Are you sure you're doing this correctly? Your heart isn't beating as hard as it normally does. I think you're going to die.""

Oh my oh my, that snake lies to me and tries to convince me that I am wrong all the time. But, I check on it.

I say, ""Oh really? I'm not doing it correctly? Let's test this and see.""

I begin box breathing and start to relax, my tension begins to go away, and I start to feel different.

I have a friend who says, ""Every time I do it, I think I'm going to pass out.""

And, I'm like ""Duh, babe. You're not used to regulating your nervous system in this way, fully present in your body, and you've never taken these long breaths before. Your natural state of rest is shallow, fast breaths. Of course, you think that you're going to pass out, you're not used to relaxing!""

ü§£ Oh, I love getting people to box breath in the middle of their panic attacks because now you have to focus on your breathing and counting. You can't even focus on all the BS thoughts that were making you so upsetty in the first place. I will always recommend box breathing.

They all tell me, ""I think I'm going to pass out."" And I'm like, ""First of all, I'm CPR certified so if that happens I got you. Second of all, that's called relaxing."" They look at me like üò≥ ""oh, you right.""

Box breathing or fireman's breath: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, repeat.

It's super easy and free.

I like to follow up with myself once I've calmed down and congratulate myself for taking the necessary steps to work through a challenging moment without dissociating or avoiding it or having a meltdown. I look for small victories. All those baby steps I take get me farther than not taking any steps at all. Some people like to leap and end up hurting themselves or falling in the process. Here I am, walking by them, taking my time, and being mindful about what I do moment to moment.

It's not perfect. Nothing and no one is perfect. This is my life. This is how I live my life. I'm quite alright with living my life knowing that I did the best I could to be me. A silly little human.

I have a friend who I told, ""I think anyone else in your situation would have killed themself or given up all together. The fact that you're even alive right now, doing this life thing, is actually amazing. Give yourself some credit.""

That really resonated with them, and they tell me that it is on their mind frequently when they are feeling down about themself.

1cvgq91,"Can't speak for him but I can share my exp, I hate people and have a cynical view of us. But like everyone I need and depend on people too. I love(d) people intensely but sometimes I do not, and sometimes I fear they do not, and that makes me question if I really actually do or ever did.  Then bad things happen and I abandon hope and isolate and lose contact, just have myself thinking about them years later. I find the idea of love in its purest form is a fantasy and if I use that gauge others, it's just an exceedingly high expectation that no one can meet so I set them up to fail. It's a good thing to remind myself I'm only human, and people do fall short of our expectations all the time that doesn't mean that it isn't love. Also trauma *can* leave people shell shocked for life in discerning what love is. Intense love and attachment is not always a good thing, it can lead to violence and abuse. But also u shouldn't be reading his texts. If he's trying to be the best he can, he will have convinced himself not to let you know things that can hurt you. You stumbling onto it will only hurt him and make him blame himself which could convert to projection. Bpd aside, many men feel unloved and alone, they have anti social stints. many want to die. 

Even if we walked in each other's shoes we would not understand one another. The greatest tool we have is language, and it too has its limitations. Some people express love in different ways like fulfilling their duty to provide. And sometimes they wonder if they are loved because of who they are or for what they do. And for many men, the truth is difficult to bear. We are only as good as we are productive and can provide. The moment we stop we are no longer necessary.

It's not that men and women are different, it's that everyone is different from one another. so even tho a demographic, ethnicity, or any other group identifier can have a shared experience, we all process it differently.

Have you noticed specific triggers in the relationship that led you to that state?

1cvfgu9,"That sounds like great advice, until your significant person says they are not responsible for your triggers.  So learning how to calm down when they have already implied that your triggers are not their problem is much harder.  If I trigger him, I am to blame because I have caused him the trauma, but because he wasn't the root of my trauma (even if he has triggered me repeatedly), it often feels like he doesn't actually care even when his words say otherwise.  It makes me doubt so many things about how a partner should be treated, but my perspective is usually wrong.  I have done things that I am ashamed of, that have destroyed any respect he may have had for me.  I have tried to earn that respect back, and for a very short time, I believed I was making positive progress.  But that all came crashing down and I haven't been the same since. Now I sometimes feel like all the effort I had put into fixing my behaviors and actions, the work I had done to gain some small amount of emotional regulation, was pointless.  Since that crash, I lash out more to demand respect that I don't deserve, and split on him consistently because of my cognitive dissonance that I can't seem to resolve.  I have tried to prioritize his needs over my own,  but I am too inconsistent for us to make any progress because I have been neglecting my own needs to not be told how my ego and pride are my problem. I don't blame him for any of this, I have caused a lot of damage and consider all of this a consequence of my own actions.  A partner has to be WILLING to be trained to meet your needs and WILLING to work with you to avoid your triggers.  You or they may get it wrong, but if you both remain willing maybe you can find balance and healing.  If they are unwilling, then they will see you as trying to control them, and they may not be  the partner for you.  But in the end, it is my responsibility to calm myself down, to think for myself, to acknowledge my emotions and not be reactive, to see and trust myself and my perspective.

I‚Äôm embarrassed!‚Äù I‚Äôve found that vocalizing things always feels like a relief, so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm hiding my Evil Bad Feelings from people who might Find Out, especially when I know that what I‚Äôm feeling might not be proportionate. It doesn‚Äôt need to be a whole conversation, but I‚Äôve always found that the longer I‚Äôm in that mental state, the bigger my fear of going back is. 

I want to say also that none of the levity I‚Äôm suggesting is meant to invalidate you. I do the same thing all the time‚ÄîI‚Äôve done it when someone said they wanted to add more salt to a meal I‚Äôd cooked, for example. It feels like shit to feel like you don‚Äôt have control.  I wasn‚Äôt ever able to use my own above suggestion of humor with my actual family because we have a bad relationship lol but I can use it with my friends. 

If it goes well and you‚Äôre feeling comfortable, you might also want to try coping ahead for the next time you play. This could be like imagining saying before you serve that you feel rusty and wanna warm up with a few practice serves, imagining them going too far, and then imagining yourself just saying ‚Äúwhoops, too far‚Äù and everything ending up being okay. 

If all of this sounds terrible right now/too soon I would suggest trying to do a physical reset! Eat a snack and take a nap. Eat something for dinner and then go to sleep and see how you feel in the morning. I always feel like my thoughts and feelings are a bit warped when I‚Äôm hungry. 

I am sending you so much care!! Feeling embarrassed is the worst for me because I feel like I can‚Äôt control the situation the way I can with anger or sadness, because admitting that I feel embarrassed feels sooooooo much worse. Good luck!!!",Afraid_Tea,False,1716087159.0

I've had many doctors tell me I probably have BPD, but have refused to take any steps to diagnose me or actualy help in any way. I am certain that I have BPD based off patterns I've noticed over the years, but since I am technically self-diagnosing, I feel too guilty to actually tell my friends and get the support I need. Reading your message made me feel understood for the first time ever in my entire life.

The way you described waiting for the other person to give me persmission to ""come back"" lifted a lot off my shoulders - I feel less alone after hearing you say that you feel that way too. I always feel that if someone doesn't invite me back, then its proof of all that i'm feeling, even with very, VERY small situations that I give a lot of weight too. I definitely want to try to incorporate humour into the way I cope with those feelings.

Its also true that the longer I'm in that mental state, the harder it is to go back. Today, I was planning out how I'll never play tennis again with anyone (even though I really enjoy playing it). Like you mentioned, it feels awful when I'm losing control of the situation around me. In the past, I've reacted by drinking and using subtances, and have even needed surgery in some cases to deal with the consequences of those impulsive actions. 

I want to try coping ahead for those situations too. Its very hard since my feelings of self-hatred / embarassement / anger are so strong that they're almost debilitating. But you gotta start somewhere, and i'm very grateful that you gave me a place to start.

Totally will be doing a physical reset over the next day or two and im also currently giving myself a hug :)

for what it‚Äôs worth, many doctors will not diagnose because it can be used to discredit you or limit your access to seeking other treatments you need. in some places, a BPD diagnosis can even exclude you from diversion based programs that help people avoid prison for minor offenses. 

being diagnosed has its good and its bad, but if you have the resources, i would look into seeing a DBT specific therapist or joining a group. you don‚Äôt need a diagnosis for these things. (therapy worked better for me than skills class/group because i do half talk therapy and half skills work). 

obviously it‚Äôs expensive, and it can take a long time, so you can also get the DBT workbook for pretty cheap online. i‚Äôm not a therapist and it might not work for you, but it‚Äôs been immensely helpful for me to learn how to work through these moments. even the book has ways to think through these situations when you‚Äôre in them. also if a therapist makes you feel like you‚Äôre ‚Äòbad‚Äô because you have BPD, drop them and find someone else

1cv8q3o,"It's great that you have a trusted friend to discuss these things with, especially someone who understands what you're going through. Having those conversations can be incredibly validating and illuminating.

Personally, I prefer long-term relationships over casual dating or one-night stands. There are several reasons why this is my preference:

- Long-term relationships provide a sense of stability and security that I find deeply comforting. With BPD, emotional turbulence is a common experience, and the predictability of a committed relationship helps to mitigate some of that chaos. Knowing that I have someone who is consistently there for me, who understands my struggles, and is committed to working through the ups and downs together, makes a significant difference in my emotional well-being.

- I value deep emotional connections. Casual dating or flings often don't provide the depth of connection that I crave. In a long-term relationship, I have the opportunity to build trust and intimacy over time, which helps to satisfy my need for closeness and reduces my fear of abandonment. The emotional investment in a long-term partner is something that gives me a sense of purpose and belonging.

- Long-term relationships offer the chance for personal growth and mutual support. Being with someone who knows me well and understands my mental health struggles means a transparent relationship with reciprocity. We support each other in our personal journeys. This mutual understanding and support can be incredibly therapeutic because it helps rewire my brain for healthy connection. 

- While casual relationships might offer excitement and novelty, they often come with unpredictability and emotional distance, which I find challenging. The fear of being rejected or abandoned is heightened for me in these situations, making it less appealing to me.

Everyone's preferences and experiences are different, of course. Some people with BPD might find casual relationships less stressful or more manageable, depending on their individual circumstances and coping mechanisms. It's all about what works best for each person.

But for me, the emotional depth, stability, and support of a long-term relationship are what make it my preferred choice.

1cv8q3o,"I have always been in long term relationships, with not a lot of gap in between them until my last one ended (basically since I was 15, I‚Äôm 22 now). For me, it was a way to feel like I had an emotional home. I always grew up feeling like an ‚Äúemotional orphan‚Äù because I couldn‚Äôt rely on my parents the way most people can. When I was in long term relationships, it eased the feeling of being ‚Äúorphaned‚Äù because I had somewhere I belonged (not in a possessive way, but just having someone who was My Person). 

I started DBT about 2 months after my last breakup in September and have been single since! It‚Äôs a weird challenge but I‚Äôm proud of myself for this.

1cv8oqi,">my fp doesn't even know they are my fp,they are my bsf,but I don't think that feeling is reciprocated,whether it's recently or never was reciprocated.

It's tough when you feel so strongly connected to someone who may not feel the same way. Have you ever tried to express your feelings to your best friend, even if not in the context of them being your FP, but just about your closeness and what the friendship means to you? 

What does BSF mean btw? 

>recently they had gained a new friend who is how their bsf and they told me about it and I felt jealous and hatred for my bsf,and ever since that conversation we had,they hadn't spoke to me or reached out to me

Feeling jealous and hurt when your FP forms close bonds with others is a common experience for pwBPD. It's understandable that this would trigger feelings of abandonment and insecurity.

How did you respond to them telling you about their new friend? Sometimes, these feelings can make us react in ways that might push others away. Could you think of anything that they could have interpreted as being pushed away? 

>I feel as if I have been abandoned and cut off,and it's making me think or realize that I am not sure any of my friends even like me in the first place or want me around,that they keep me around out of pity

I understand how incredibly painful that is. It's important to remember though that these feelings, while valid, may be intensified by certain core beliefs that give rise to the symptoms of BPD.

Have you talked to other friends about how you feel? Sometimes, open communication can clarify misunderstandings and provide reassurance.

>,I feel as if my bsf has cut me off,but in the event they speak to me I wouldn't know what to say,I kinda wanna cut them off now

The impulse to cut someone off before they can hurt you further is a protective mechanism, but it might not lead to the resolution or closure you need. If your best friend reaches out, it might help to express how you've been feeling in a calm and honest way. 

You could say something like:

I've been feeling really hurt and left out lately. When you told me about your new friend, I felt abandoned, and it made me question our friendship. Can we talk about this?

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) actually has several skills that can help you in situations like this. Skills in the Interpersonal Effectiveness module can help you communicate your needs and feelings more effectively without escalating conflict. There's a lot to it so I won't get into it here, but if you're interested, I can dip into my notes about what skills I find most useful.

Bottomline is it's okay to feel hurt, jealous, or abandoned, but also work on understanding where these feelings are coming from and how you can address them constructively.",ladyhaly,False,1716082195.0

1cv83ox,"Hey OP. Sorry you‚Äôre going through this, he doesn‚Äôt sound like a catch and given you‚Äôve caught him in lies already I‚Äôd say you deserve a lot better. But ultimately that is your choice. 

I wanted to comment on the wider context of the post. As a fellow BPD-haver, I can relate to asking questions like this of partners. You don‚Äôt say, but the way I interpreted the post was that you maybe asked him ‚Äòhow likely would you be to cheat?‚Äô Or ‚Äòif you had to put a percentage on it‚Ä¶?‚Äô  And please believe me when I say I‚Äôm not attacking you here, but if that is the case then my advice would be to really explore and work on that (whether you stay with this dude or not, it should be addressed). 

Something I‚Äôve learnt over 15 years of horrendous relationships where I‚Äôve questioned my boyfriends, is that no matter what they respond with I won‚Äôt be happy. If I asked a boyfriend if he would ever cheat and he said no, then I wouldn‚Äôt believe him and if he said yes then I‚Äôd get triggered. If I asked them ‚Äòdo you think she‚Äôs pretty?‚Äô About some girl and they said no, I‚Äôd accuse them of lying. If they said yes, I‚Äôd have a breakdown and start crying and lashing out. 

It‚Äôs so fucking difficult I know, but I have learnt the hard way multiple times that you shouldn‚Äôt ask questions you won‚Äôt like the answer to. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm fixed, I‚Äôve been single for a long time now so maybe I‚Äôd find myself doing it again in future but the last relationship I had was a lot better in that respect because I had learnt from past experiences. It was even a long distance relationship where I wouldn‚Äôt see him for months and months on end, yet for the first time ever I was able to RELAX. 

I‚Äôm absolutely terrified of cheating too. Seriously. It‚Äôs one of my worst nightmares. But it‚Äôs true that if someone is going to cheat, they‚Äôre going to do it whether you question them about it or not. Whether you worry about it or not. Whether you‚Äôre blissfully unaware or super hyper vigilant. The problem is, the more we look for these things and the more we worry about it, the more we create a self fulfilling prophecy. By that, I don‚Äôt mean we necessarily cause them to actually cheat on us, but we end up pushing them away and feeling abandoned which is ultimately the main thing we‚Äôve been trying to avoid.  By being so aware and so vigilant and so on edge, we create disharmony in our relationships. We pick up on every little thing, every little misspoken word, every glance at another woman, and that ultimately makes partners feel they are walking on egg shells. Ironically how a lot of us felt when we were growing up which likely made us this way in the first place. And this is something that continues and cycles from relationship to relationship. So even if this guy is an ahole, you could break up and meet someone who is the most trustworthy person ever and without addressing some of these behaviours the same pattern will repeat itself. And some people are undeserving of that mistrust, and what‚Äôs worse is we ourselves know that and that makes it‚Äôs harder when we can‚Äôt always control our reactions. So my advice would be, if that does sound relatable, to take some time to be introspective and explore it further. 

I don‚Äôt want to shit on your bf, I don‚Äôt know him, but it doesn‚Äôt sound like something you deserve in my opinion. Regardless of what you decide to do though, I hope you can get to a place someday or even just meet someone someday that doesn‚Äôt make you question this stuff. We all deserve to just relax and have our own backs yknow? I know it‚Äôs tough, and I wish you all the best.

I would feel insecure from this, and given the way my BPD manifest itself, it would cause me to overly attach to this person, trying to ensure that they wouldn't leave me. This isn't healthy, and I'd recommend you consider what being with someone that can say that to you would do in the long run. Would you react in a similar manner to me?

I suggest you also consider all of the time that will be wasted and spent on someone that can knowingly hurt you like that.

Try and remember that YOU are the most important person to yourself. Take care of you. There are plenty of people out there that will love you for you, support you, and want to stay with you. You do not have to put up with someone that will knowingly hurt you. You do not have to live in fear of someone hurting you.

1cv83ox,"To me, what is most important is that you already think he's lied and been shady. 

It's giving teens/early-mid twenties to even have a debate over an exact percentage for someone's ""chance of cheating."" Have you ever been cheated on? I've been in a good number of serious relationships that have ended in me being cheated on and I can tell you that you should never 1) ask if someone will cheat on you and 2) believe any response to that type of question. The truth is that some people don't think they'll cheat but do, and some people know they have the capacity to cheat but can't get over their own selfish wants to consider denying themselves of a potential new relationship.

My BPD advice is that you'll likely always feel anxious that your s/o is going to leave you - fear of abandonment is a main aspect of our disorder - so you have to decide to blindly trust that person. You will destroy yourself and your relationship with suspicion. You have to choose to not be suspicious of your s/o. You have to choose to be forthright about your boundaries (e.g., I am not okay with my boyfriend going on 1-on-1 after-work 'meetings' with his female colleague to the nicest restaurant in town, I am not okay with an open relationship, i am not okay with cheating...), but then you need to let the person make their own decision on if they'll respect what you've told them. You have to give them the benefit of the doubt that they're agreeing to it which is why they're staying with you after you've expressed yourself. If they fuck up, you can decide whether you'll forgive them or not.

After being cheated on so many times when I was younger, I learned that it wasn't helping me to constantly be stressed about my boyfriend and my relationship. What i mean by ""not helping me"" is that the stress was physically and emotionally damaging me and this would occur whether the guy was or wasn't cheating. So as long as the guy was (to the best of my knowledge and perception) respecting my relationship boundaries AND I felt that my needs were being met, I had to choose to trust him and not let myself dip my toe in whatifs.

As people with borderline we ask and ask questions and want specific answers but because that is just our destructive energy looking for love and validation. I see you asking him and two to three percent is not bad. For me I'd give my husband maybe 1 percent chance because we spend every waking moment together cause I haven't started my new job yet. When I work again he would probably think the percentage I would cheat could go up as I could lie about going to work or have a work husband and the thoughts that I'd think he could cheat before he works again is higher because now ill be busy and he could do whatever. Of course we hope he doesn't but there's always a percent. But if he's lied before that separately is a thing to deal with. I think this one is just a split because the question and answer is not too bad and logical.

I'm definitely not saying that monogamy can't be challenging and cause positive personal growth... But monogamy is also the main ""status quo"" of America... Which means that most people in America understand monogamy, have experience practicing monogamy themselves, and know others that have had failures and successes in monogamy--thus, there are many ways a monogamous person can find support in learning how to successfully navigate monogamy *and* monogamous people generally are socially accepted and don't face discrimination for being monogamous. Polyamory, on the other hand has only been practiced by a small fraction of people, has ample social stigma, and is generally misunderstood by most people--so choosing to pursue a polyamorous lifestyle can be much more challenging in the fact that, *when polyamorous people struggle in their relationships*, they really don't have access to *nearly* as much support as monogamous people can access.

Since everyone only has so much capacity for struggling before they would burn out... And personal growth cannot be achieved without struggling... I consider anything that can cause us to achieve personal growth to be in direct competition for our focus, time, and energy with everything else that can cause us to experience personal growth.

Not all struggling is bad struggling. Is the work necessary to learn a new skill for work or a new coping method to manage a BPD symptom not a struggle?? How about doing the work necessary to make your body strong and powerful? I would say all of those examples require struggles (whether that is a lot of struggling or a less intense amount of struggling)--but all can be greatly beneficial to you.

She was terminally ill. She also had a rare muscle condition that usually causes dogs to lose the ability to walk after about 2 years. She kept her ability to walk for 9 years with it. She was rescued from dogfighting when she was 6 months old and then lived with an owner who loved her so much but overfed her. She had to overcome obesity. She then developed a stomach condition that caused her to gain and lose weight far too easily, meaning that multiple times, she had to overcome being underweight and being overweight. She almost died in car crashes a few times. She was extremely intelligent, extremely emotional, extremely over dramatic and expressive, extremely stubborn, extremely unique, and extremely skilled in learning words.

As soon as I came back from Hawaii and was around my family+friends+car, I felt SO much better even though my partner was still in Vermont (still super horrible but nowhere as horrible as being so far apart!). 

I would say the main thing is to spend time with your friends+family+people who you like.

It SUCKS because your mind will probably be on him all of the time and you will feel SO anxious 24/7, but the best thing you can do yourself is keep yourself busy (an idle mind is the devil's playground!). See your friends (or make new ones), focus on school, try new foods, etc. Just live as normally as you can if he were there with you. 

Also, be sure to communicate VERY clearly about texting/calling boundaries so that you know what to interpret as normal and not normal. My ex and I called every day at the beginning of the long distance, but soon found that calling about two-three times a week worked better for both of our schedules. Make sure you ask your boyfriend how often you should expect texts or calls so that you know what to expect. In a long distance relationship, the main fire of the relationship becomes digital communication/effort, so make sure you know what to expect.

1cuz17d,"Hey OP! Quiet BPD is a term that people use to describe how their BPD symptoms present. Whether it is ""real"" or not isn't a straightforward answer since it depends on what you qualify as ""real."" It is not recognized in the most recent edition of the DSM (a tool that practitioners use for diagnosing mental disorders) but it is something that is being talked about in emerging research on BPD. I choose to identify with quiet BPD because I feel that it more accurately reflects myself and is an easy way to communicate how my symptoms present. 

With quiet BPD, there is a tendency to direct everything inwards instead of outwards. Instead of blaming others, we blame ourselves. Instead of expressing our feelings, we more often suppress them. We feel a lot of guilt and shame that we internalize and often hide everything to avoid rejection (ie., the fear that if we express anger and rage, people will leave us). Both BPD and quiet BPD involve feeling emotions very intensely, using poor coping mechanisms and self-harming (ie., impulsive and risky sex, drug abuse, shopping addiction, etc.), and struggling with our identity and the sense of who we are.   


For example, when I'm upset about something that my partner has done, I tend to blame myself for it and hide the way I'm feeling because I don't want my partner to sense that I'm mad at them and leave me. I feel like I can control my partner staying and leaving by presenting carefree and unbothered, when I'm really just screaming and breaking down on the inside.",skinkess,False,1716054565.0

I don't know your dynamic with her, so I'm working purely on assumptions, but why would she lie to you about where she is?

1cuyf7a,"A few thoughts, sorry in advance for the long message:  
  
You most likely did overwhelm him, with a long, deep message that seemed to have been kind of out of the blue on his end. But also, he did say that he didn't want to do this anymore, and from his perspective, your message could have been you doing ""this"" again despite what he said and been interpreted as you not respecting his decision or boundary. Especially after you refusing to stay friends. I can understand the reasoning behind you not being friends with someone you have feelings for to not expose yourself to pain, but for him, he lost someone he cared about. You seemed very black and white about your relationship with him, like it's either romantic or nothing, so it might be hard for him to receive that kind of message from you at the moment. 

about the ""i hate you"" or ""never talk to me"" thing, I apologize it it's too harsh but I kinda doubt that this would have brought you any more closure. You wouldn't have had the conversation and answers you seem to have expected. I personally don't see a difference between ""never talk to me again' and blocking you though, to me they kinda express the same thought, one without words... If you change him blocking you into him saying he doesn't want to talk to you in this scenario, is this helping you getting some closure or understanding him better?  
  
About the ""he owes me a response"" part, I disagree with that. I don't think anyone owes anyone specific ways to react, respond, or address things, at least between two individuals. Him blocking you probably isnt great to you and definitely doesn't help your relationship, but for him it might seem like the best way to deal with your sudden message, your expectations, the loss of you as a friend, and feeling overwhelmed by all of it. Maybe not the best response, but it's a response, expecting or forcing a different response than what he is willing to give you isn't going to lead you anywhere, at least in my opinion. I can understand the disappointment though.

A way I would have done things a little differently, and it might not be too late for that:  
I wouldn't have started with a long deep message completely out of the blue after a long no contact period. I would have maybe started with a few friendly messages to see if he is ready for this conversation and appear less threatening. I would have eased him into this conversation slowly too, to know if I should continue or stop. If he doesn't want to talk about this, you should respect that.If he wants to move on, you need to respect that. A relationship is between two people equally involved, not one and another one feeling obligated to tag along. 

I would ask myself if I'm ready to be just friends, and if not, brace myself for rejection and accept that you won't talk to each other anymore, and not try anything else. 

And lastly: him having different relationship needs is valid, you being hurt is very valid too. I can relate to the spiraling, questioning, self doubt, anxiety, etc. This is so painful. Sadly, if you look for the solution or remedy to those intense feelings in others, you will often be very disappointed and feel worse. It is hard, but you can only soothe those feelings within yourself.",Otter_n_11,False,1716046342.0
1cuyf7a,"This is probably the best advice I have gotten ever, thank you so much for taking the time to write it.

I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. I never wanted to overwhelm him, I told him that he can take the time to read through it and respond, hoping it‚Äôd ease him. But it did not.

My most recent message to his number was ‚Äúhi, im sorry for how things went down. How have you been?‚Äù. My friend told me that this is way less threatening, and I hope he will respond to it. If not, then I will be fine with that I think. As you said, no response is a response and he probably just wants to move on. It‚Äôs just that it leaves me wondering you know? I want something clear cut and dry, which you could argue that him blocking me was a pretty clear ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk anymore‚Äù, and maybe it was him sparing my feelings.",demetriiux,True,1716047356.0

I was a fucking shit. 

It does get worse, only initially, it should. You should have to face all the worse parts of yourself and you should look for even uglier things, you should look for the ugliest worst parts of yourself that you never wanted to see or know or become aware of. It's only in that that you will have the power to understand and know what you have to confront and change about yourself in treatment and become the person you actually want to be. 

You have to be willing to sit with your discomforts and challenge yourself if you're actually going to be able to work towards remission with the disorder. And remission is possible. I believe in its ability to be cured, but that's controversial still. For people who enter the recommended treatment protocol, there's a greater than 50% remission rate just within the first 24 months. In a longitudinal study, at 16 years (i know it's a long time for you but this is following everyone regardless of treatment received or not or life circumstances) follow up from the time of diagnosis 72% of patients were experiencing 8 years of remission, that reflected data of similar longitudinal studies. The longest follow up at 27 years found 92% were in remission regardless of treatment received.  

I can't stress enough how treatable this condition is, regardless of what you may hear otherwise. Get yourself into treatment and don't stop, ther days where it's hardest and the days you don't want to go are the days you need to be there the most. Learn all you can about the most up to date information. 

Congrats on being diagnosed at 18, you are at a fantastic advantage, use it and heal. 

And absolutely do not avoid processing your trauma either. That is every bit as important to treating your BPD as any other treatment protocol to reduce long term suffering.

Percentages are only one piece of the picture.  Getting help and working on being healthier puts you in a different cohort. Meaning, the same percentages don't necessarily apply. Like if you looked at statistics for people with prostate cancer, there would be a big variance between treated and untreated. Same with BPD. 

Also, there have been advances in bpd treatment and diagnosis that haven't been realized in the statistics yet. In the past, many cases of BPD have been reported under different disorders or not at all. So the ones that came out in the statistics were the obvious cases and usually involved suicide. That skews the statistics in a big way. DBT is also relatively under-adopted. It could provide meaningful impact on the suicide rate as it becomes a first-line treatment for BPD.

Lastly, statistics are usually misunderstood because they take a complex situation and give it a number. Metrics and statistics are a part of my manipulation playbook at work. I use them all the time at work to get people to do stuff, or to get people to look past issues I want to hide. I will focus on certain statistics to leave a better impression on people to enhance my business relationships. I will pump up my team's enthusiasm with them even. It's weird how much emotional impact you can make with a well-timed mention of a statistic.

But when I got my diagnosis, days later one of my friends was talking with me about it and told me ""This is not a death sentence. There is hope."" And I believed them and I still believe them 

I don't think this disorder is a death sentence. ""Death sentence"" implies certainty of an early death. I think of BPD more like cancer, maybe. Cancer was once a death sentence. But now we have better treatment for it and if you can catch it early enough and get the right treatment, you can be fine

And the thing is, suicide is not the only option for a premature death with BPD. BPD is also associated with risky behaviors, and some risky behaviors can have fatal consequences. But you know what? We can avoid the risks or mitigate them. We can keep moving forward

We might always need treatment. We might always need to go back to therapy or need medications to help with certain symptoms (I'm on mood stabilizers and anti-anxiety/anti-depressants, personally).

When i learned about remission and when i confirmed it was actually true and heard so much from so many professionals frustrated by the lack of appropriate education given to patients regarding remission, i bolstered my efforts and reached remission in 6 months, but i had also been ready for so long, i had been in treatment for so long, i had all the tools to cope, i just never took the final steps in believing i could build a self identity, shake out the last fears of abandonment, leave the emptiness behind, and focus on trauma work instead. After languishing for 10 years contented to be miserable and borderline for life, all it took was the belief and understanding that it was entirely within my grasp to rid myself of the anguish. If you reframe how you view the world, you change the world. 

Here are some better statistics: 

Following the recommended treatment protocol there was a greater than 50% remission rate at just 24 months. 

This is following presidents after diagnosis, but no following their efforts to treat the disorder: 

Even when followed up 2 years after the initial assessment, about one-quarter of patients experience a remission of the diagnosis (defined here as meeting less than 2 symptoms for a period of 2 months or longer) during the prior 2 years.

 During a 10-year period of follow-up, 91% achieve at least a 2-month remission, with 85% achieving remission for 12 months or longer.

Similar results extended out to 16 years using a slightly different definition of remission (no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for a period of 2 years or longer) and found that by 16 years, 99% of patients have at least a 2-year period of remission and 78% have a remission lasting 8 years.

its a very complex subject and there is likely a multitude of factors which constitute premature death in individuals with bpd. so its important for people to take that into account and know that if you are the 10% that this happens to, then it could be related to something else, rather than waking up one day and attempting suicide. which i think is a common myth when people first get diagnosed and they hear this statistic because it adds to the common assumption they are doomed to never recover and will ‚Äò give up eventually ‚Äò since without covering the specifics, seems like all cases are by suicide which isnt true",Proffesional-Fix4481,False,1716052600.0

Idk. You keep saying weight this weight that, weight weight weight. Not actual illnesses, diseases, or health concerns. Yes coping behaviors like eating disorders, substance abuse, and sedentary lifestyles are unhealthy. Yes some medications can have severe side effects(although there has, to date, never been evidence, aside from mood stabilizers on a case by case basis for symptom relief, indicated for the treatment of BPD).

But... none of that has any bearing on on size. When someone is diagnosed with a weight related illness, or when someone is showing signs or indications that their body is not handling their size well, then weight becomes a factor, then it's a factor, and it's a private matter between them and their doctors.

If the agency managing your care is good enough, they will  be willing to keep trying to find good matches, but thats often not easy. 

But what they told u for housing seems very unfair. I'm sorry that happened. I'm in a unique situation where it's hard for me to get into housing programs because I live in my mother's building. There's barriers if the landlord is a relative. It's so strange because there seems to be this default assumption that a relative being In control is a good thing. That has never been my experience but they don't care what the relationship is between them. They only care that the landlord is a relative and nothing else. 

It's sad that Australia of all places is like what u have described. U guys have Tony Attwood for Christ sake. When I first learned about his work I was thinking Australia must be ND friendly. I guess they have a ways to go. Here in US help exists but the thing is, it's a secret. Nobody tells u these things exist and so most ppl get thru life in unnecessarily awful circumstances. I myself didn't find out about most of these programs till my daughter was already an adult. People can't ask for things that they don't know exist. I only learned about this because one of my best friends works in the field and even SHE found out by chance. She found out because a family she was servicing told her!

1cus8e7,"I feel completely alone 99% of the time. I'm a spiritual person though, and meditation and reading tarot cards helps, when I can find the motivation. But I just simply try to bear the empty feeling the best I can. The only time this feeling goes away is when I'm in a cohesive community and/or feeling close to Source/God. We're meant to be in community and connection. But that doesn't always happen for some people, myself included. It's misery but I'm too afraid to kill myself, so I somehow keep living. 

Some of us are more sensitive to the cruelty and the pain in the world than others. I've always been sensitive to it and wondered how no one else cared about other people even half the amount I did. Not trying to sound arrogant - I really felt isolated in my care and brokenheartedness. But it's seemingly just the nature of being human for the majority of people. Over time, I've learned to have some mental boundaries, and others' pain and suffering doesn't affect me so deeply and personally anymore. Mostly because I've accepted that I can't really do anything to solve their issues. I can just help the people who are in front of me. And even then, I have a lot of limitations.

You're not alone in feeling this way. It sounds like you're an HSP or highly sensitive person. There's a lot of info online about it. Dr. Elaine Aron's work is good.

That's shocking. Did his message provide any specific reasons for why he thinks that?

>These past few days have been a bit awkward, yes, but for external factors. Nothing to do with us as a couple. If fact, last night before he went to bed, we had a nice talk about us and about what was going on and we solved (or so I thought) things and agreed these external factors weren't going to grt between us. 

It‚Äôs great that you both had a conversation about the issues you were facing. What were these external factors ‚Äî if you don't mind sharing? Do you think they could have influenced his decision despite your agreement?

>He is aware that I have bpd and since he's a therapist he always knew how to treat me and what to say etc. 

It sounds like his understanding of BPD has been a significant part of your relationship. Do you feel that his knowledge as a therapist helped support you in your relationship? Could there be any aspect of his professional perspective that influenced his decision to end the relationship?

Are you in therapy?

>I don't really understand why he would want to suddenly break up with me just like that. I'm honestly devastated and have been crying non-stop all day. I don't understand and everything just hurts so much.

Your pain is completely valid, especially with the abruptness of the breakup. Have you been able to ask him for more clarity on his decision? Sometimes understanding the reasons can help in processing the situation.

>I don't resent or hate him (I'm not the ""typical"" borderline [you kkow how people think we are/stereotype us] that gets angry, I just always get really depressed). 

It's important to recognize that everyone's experience with BPD is unique. It's positive that you're aware of how you typically respond in situations like these. How have you managed similar feelings of depression in the past?

>This is kind of what I (37F btw) always feared that it would happen (abandonment, once again) and I don't really know how to deal with this.

Living in an abusive environment is incredibly harmful not just to your well-being but also possibly to your (ex) boyfriend. Has he asked you to look at getting out of your situation ‚Äî say, looking into local shelters, social services, or community groups against domestic violence/abuse?

Frankly speaking, your most urgent problem isn't the breakup; it's your current living situation. 

>And I have like 30 dollars in my bank account (I was saving, but my kitty got sick and had to use it all on her, sadly it didn't helped, since she passed on January 2).

I'm sorry to hear about your cat. I have 5 cats myself and they are like my children. I understand how profound the loss of a pet can me. They're family. 

In terms of your financial situation, have you explored any government assistance programs or charities that might be able to help with your immediate needs? There are often resources available for people in financial distress ‚Äî such as food banks and emergency financial assistance. I imagine if you got in touch with a social worker that they could help you gain access to these resources, including the need for shelter. 

>My (ex?) boyfriend (I really don't want to call him that, it's hard) lives in another country and the idea is (was?) to get a job as hard as it can be and save all the money I have and go where he is. Being in a long distance relationship was hard enough as it was.

It seems like you've encountered huge setbacks against your shared goal of closing the gap. Your living situation is a huge roadblock against this. How did you plan to address this? What was his opinion on it? I cannot imagine he'd be quiet about it ‚Äî especially since he's a therapist. 

Honestly, I wouldn't call your living situation an external factor at all. You live there. It affects every facet of your daily life ‚Äî and therefore your relationship with your (ex) boyfriend. Please don't minimise the impact of the abuse you're experiencing. 

Have you been able to communicate with your (ex) boyfriend since the breakup text? Clarifying his intentions and expressing your feelings might help with understanding the situation better.

>My ""roommate"" doesn't like me talking or whatever with other guys and so he gets overjealous and overprotective. That was always stressful on my relationship with my bf, but we always managed. So yeah, that was the ""external factor"". This past few days it got worse.

It really seems like your roommate's behavior is contributing significantly to your stress ‚Äî enough that it strained the relationship with your (ex) bf. Is there any way to set boundaries with him or limit interactions? Documenting his abusive behavior could also be important if you need to seek help from authorities or support services.

>But like I said, we had talked last night and agreed that no matter what we weren't going to let that ruin what we had. To reply another of your questions, yes, he's understanding and support was always a big helped and why k always felt so safe with him. I don't think that he knowing about bpd had anything to do with his decision.

His support seems to have been very important to you. If possible, try to have an open conversation with him to understand his perspective and clarify where you both stand. This might provide some closure or open up possibilities for moving forward.

My most immediate thought right now is that the conversation the previous night could possibly have gone differently in for him. Perhaps what he got from the conversation was that his presence enabled you to continue the cycle of abuse with your roommate instead of working on breaking it.

Has your living situation been the reality of the entirety of your relationship?

>I'm not in therapy at the moment, I dropped a while back. I know I should go back and I want to. But I'm always afraid.

I've found therapy incredibly beneficial, especially during challenging times. It's natural to feel afraid, but reaching out for professional help can provide you with the support and tools you need to navigate your situation. Many therapists offer sliding scale fees based on income, which could make therapy more affordable for you.

I would also like to point out the elephant in the room: You're afraid of therapy, but you're seemingly not afraid of the domestic abuse you're experiencing with your roommate? How were you able to reciprocate the emotional work and support your (ex) boyfriend provided you? 

I feel confused. I don't understand how that's an external factor at all. It greatly strained the relationship ‚Äî enough for it to be the topic of conversation prior to the breakup. 

As you said, the bottomline of that conversation is that you both agreed to not let it affect your relationship. How exactly is that to be achieved?

>Losing someone feels always like a grief, it's painful, really painful. How I coped before? I cried for god knows how long and felt sorry for myself and always reminded myself how worthless I am and how my parents were always right about how no kne would ever love me.

Grief and loss are incredibly painful, and it's essential to be gentle with yourself during this time. Have you considered journaling or other forms of creative expression to process your feelings? I personally prefer digital watercolor and writing poems along with journaling.

I also encourage you to look into the Defectiveness Schema and Abandonment Schema and how it affects intimate relationships. 

The Defectiveness Schema is characterised by the core belief that one is inherently defective, bad, unlovable, or inferior and that if others knew the ""real"" person, they would reject or shame them.

These two statements you said align directly with the Defectiveness Schema:

- I always reminded myself how worthless I am.

- How my parents were always right about how no one would ever love me.

The Abandonment Schema is characterised by the belief that significant others will not be able to continue providing emotional support, connection, strength, or protection. They will leave, die, or abandon the person for someone else.

This statement aligns with this:

Losing someone feels always like a grief, it's painful, really painful.

There is also the possibility of the Emotional Deprivation Schema at work. It's characterised by the core belief that one's need for emotional support will not be adequately met by others. This can manifest as a lack of nurturance, empathy, or protection. What indicates this is the sense of being unloved and unworthy of love, as implied by the reference to parental validation of worthlessness.

Some interventions that need to happen in therapy include:

- Cognitive restructuring to challenge and change negative self-beliefs, using positive affirmations, and working on self-compassion exercises.

- Developing secure relationships, working on trust issues, and using grounding techniques to manage anxiety related to abandonment fears.

- Identifying and communicating emotional needs, building supportive relationships, and engaging in self-nurturing activities.

I would like to highlight that all of this is work you need to do with your own therapist. Your (ex) boyfriend, despite being a therapist, cannot help you with this. Our romantic partner can support us, but they cannot be tasked with saving us. That's not what a romantic relationship is for. 

>When I was in my teen years I used to resort to self-harm (I used to cut my legs), but thankfully I haven't done that in like 2 decades. But mainly I just cry and want the world to end.

It's a positive step that you haven't engaged in self-harm via cutting for a long time. If you ever feel the urge to do that again, reach out to a crisis hotline, present to ED, or call someone you really trust.

I found developing a safety plan and using DBT distress tolerance skills ‚Äî such as STOP, TIPP, self-soothing, and grounding ‚Äî to be very helpful.

I would also encourage you to zoom out a bit regarding your situation. Is it possible that you're self harming in another way ‚Äî for example, by tolerating and minimising the impact of the abuse you experience with your roommate? You find therapy scary and you've come to tolerate abuse ‚Äî to the point of not making the possible connection between it and your breakup. 

What's going on there? Wouldn't you say that's a form of self harm? 

>I think I answered everything you ask. I don't mind you asking. Thanks for your support and talking the time to read me and writing all that even when you don't know me.

You're very welcome. You're not alone, and there are people who care about your well-being and want to help you through this tough time.

1cuo52x,"Like everyone else said, returning it is for the best. As someone who‚Äôs both significantly overspent due to mental health issues, and worked in retail for a while, I‚Äôm gonna share a couple things that hopefully make you feel a bit better. 

1. I have issues with impulsive spending, mostly because I‚Äôm bipolar, but I have BPD as well, and I know it can be a symptom of both. I‚Äôve spent over $10k of necessary savings on frivolous bullshit in 3 months. Try not to beat yourself up too much about this. It‚Äôs good to develop strategies to avoid this happening again and becoming more serious, but you‚Äôll come out of it okay. It‚Äôs good that you caught yourself before spending more and it‚Äôs amazing if you have the ability to return the item and come out of this cleanly. 

2. I promise the retail staff is not going to care or judge you for returning the item. If they do, they‚Äôre an asshole, and even then, they won‚Äôt think about it for more than five minutes. I promise. 

3. It‚Äôs normal to feel like you want to spend money, or do anything else to bring a hit of dopamine, when you‚Äôre feeling generally unhappy with your life. Your feelings are completely understandable and plenty of people who aren‚Äôt mentally ill overspend in moments where they‚Äôre feeling down, too.

1cuo52x,"You need to identify your triggers and, in the meantime, set up safety precautions. 

The easiest is what they teach in AA/NA, which is just to avoid the people, places, and things that entice you to engage in your addiction (spending money in your case). So that would be like stop going to the mall/stores, don't hang out with friends that enable or pressure you to spend more than you should (a good friend wouldn't do that, btw), don't visit websites you often spend money on, etc.\
But in my opinion, that isn't the best technique. Don't get me wrong, it can *definitely* help in the immediate. It's just not realistic to avoid things forever, so it's important to have other precautions in place as well.

So other precautions: Take a set amount of money but leave your debit/credit cards at home when you go shopping, don't have your payment info saved on your phone at all so you have to go through the extra steps to buy stuff (that will hopefully give you more time to realize when you shouldn't), have a friend help hold you accountable if possible, don't go shopping just for the hell of it, make shopping lists and try to stick to only buying what's on the list, as soon as you pick up an item at the store ask yourself ""Do I need this? Do I actually want this? Do I have money for this?"" If you get at least 2 out 3 yeses, then you should be okay, but if you get 0-1 yeses, you definitely shouldn't buy it. I would ask yourself those questions with *every single item*, even items on your list that you *know* you need (like groceries and tp). Getting in the habit of asking that even when you don't need to *should* help you be more inclined to do so when you do need to. It takes about 1-2 months of *consistently* doing something for it to become a habit. Once it becomes a habit, it gets so much easier to do and honestly, you might even feel weird not doing it after it's a habit.

But what's also really important is to identify your triggers. Why do you spend more than you have? What were you feeling when you bought the stuff? Were you on a manic type high? Were you feeling down and thought new stuff would make you happy? Were you trying to distract yourself/escape what you were feeling? Was it just FOMO? Did you feel like you had to buy stuff for your friend to like you? Did you feel like buying this stuff would make you more worthy? When did you first realize you made a mistake in buying all that? Were you still with your friend, or were you alone again?

1cuo19t,"I'm really sorry you're going through this. Breakups are incredibly tough. It's okay to feel this way. It makes sense. Recognize that your feelings are valid and that it‚Äôs normal to struggle with letting go, especially when there‚Äôs uncertainty involved.

While it‚Äôs natural to want clear closure, sometimes it‚Äôs not possible to get the exact words you need from your ex. Accepting that you may not get this is a step towards healing. Focus on the facts you do know: The relationship has ended ‚Äî and you need to move forward for your own well-being. Closure often comes from within. Reflect on why the relationship ended and what you‚Äôve learned from it. Write a letter to your ex expressing your feelings and then choose whether to send it or simply keep it as a way to process your emotions.

Keep yourself busy with activities you enjoy. Engage in hobbies, spend time with friends and family, and try new things. Talk to them about how you're feeling. If that's not something you can see yourself doing, then consider looking for a therapist. Sometimes, just sharing your thoughts with someone who listens and understands can help alleviate some of the emotional burden.

Take care of your physical and emotional health. Exercise, eat well, get enough sleep, and engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Self-care is crucial during times of emotional stress.

If you haven‚Äôt already, establish clear boundaries with your ex. This might mean unfollowing them on social media, avoiding places they frequent, and refraining from contacting them. These boundaries can help you create emotional distance and begin to heal. When you find yourself fixated on the possibility of your ex coming back, challenge those thoughts. Remind yourself why the relationship ended and why it‚Äôs important for you to move on. Reframe your thinking to focus on your future and the new opportunities it holds.

Use this time to invest in yourself. Set new goals, explore your passions, and work on personal development. Focusing on your growth can shift your attention away from the past and towards a positive future. Also, healing takes time, so it‚Äôs important to be patient with yourself. There‚Äôs no set timeline for moving on from a breakup. Allow yourself to grieve the loss, but also encourage yourself to look forward to new possibilities.

Remember, it‚Äôs okay to seek help and support during this time. Moving on from a relationship is a process, but with time, patience, and self-compassion, you will find a way to let go and move forward.",ladyhaly,False,1716006657.0
1cunwug,"I‚Äôm truly sorry to learn that you are in such a difficult situation. Being stressed and confused is understandable, and it‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt know how to behave with your feelings right now.

Recognizing your emotions is the first step. In circumstances like this one, sorrow, loss or confusion are typical. Allow yourself to mourn for the death of the relationship and give yourself permission to go through them.

If you're feeling like you might harm yourself, please seek immediate help. Reach out to a crisis hotline and a therapist who can provide you with the support and tools you need to work through your emotions. My therapist provides me a safe space to explore my feelings and develop strategies to cope with them. I think something like that would help you too. 

*Why did I need to lie?* I think doing a psychological deep dive to really figure out the answer to this question is key to your personal development. Reflecting on your patterns with your therapist can help you develop healthier ways of communicating in the future.

Rebuilding trust with yourself is also crucial. Before you can rebuild trust with others, it's important to be honest with yourself about your actions, understand your motivations, and work on self-forgiveness. 

Don't be too hard on yourself. Do things that are enjoyable and make you feel good about yourself. Redirect the love and energy you have for your ex-partner into self-love and self-improvement. Consider pursuing new goals that give you a sense of purpose and fulfillment.

Remember, healing is a process, and it's okay to take it one day at a time. You are not alone, and there are people and resources available to help you through this. Your life has value, and you deserve to find happiness and peace within yourself.",ladyhaly,False,1716011337.0

That harsh inner critic takes time to face and it's not only with a therapist you gott be challenged out in the world we need discomfort sometimes it's just growing pains.

1cuierg,"Of course, like I genuinely do care because I understand it, this shit is so hard. I feel genuine hopelessness sometimes; I have literally nothing to look forward to and no reason to keep going, but this messy and uncertain life just keeps on. Once I escape the negativity it's only a matter of time before I reach a new low, I just can't escape it it seems like.

I relate so much to feeling like trash, I've been made to feel like that so damn much these last few years it's actually making me go a little crazy. Every person in my life has abandoned me and no one seems to care about my mental health issues, they all seem to have forgotten how I was literally always there to help them whenever they needed it. Just shows you how shitty some people are, some will suck you dry and leave you feeling empty. Somehow I always attract these types of people. If one person just actually believed in me, liked me for who I am in full and helped me I think I'd be doing so much better but I have no one and I just keep drowning. I've developed issues with dissociation from all the bs I've experienced and that just makes everything a lot harder.

Being left alone has led me to develop a similar care-less attitude as well, like I really don't give a shit about other people anymore, but at the same time I'm really self conscious still. It's weird and people don't understand it when I tell them that I don't really care, because my actions show otherwise. I really don't care, but do at the same time because I feel like I should. 

One important thing to remember is these people definitely aren't right, they're just negative and they like to beat on people who are already down. It's a weird human psychology thing that I don't really understand, but it's common for people to pick on others who are already dealing with things. We're like targets for them to beat on to feel better about themselves.

1. Your partner, their actions and them not being attuned to your needs and boundaries.

2. Your self-perception.

With the context you've given, it seems like your partner hasn't given you any reason to feel insecure. If he has, that's a discussion to have between you two. 

It is important to work on how you view yourself, how you view the world (including your past traumas) and this all stems from your beliefs. Journal. Why do you feel the way you feel, what triggers it, what have you realized allows you to self-soothe? It's not an overnight fix. Seek help and advice from others, doing nice things for yourself is great, have patience and acceptance and don't ever beat yourself up for feeling down.

I realized a part of what triggered this insecure spiral was that I was more focused on his needs than my own. I was scared to say no to seeing him because I want to make him happy and that fear if I don‚Äôt meet his needs he will leave. 

I told him this and he reminded me he wants me to be happy too, and healthy, so if I need space I should take it.

It might not be for everyone, but it works for me. Since I'm into games, I'll find one that immerses me in my own little bubble, taking my mind off the never-ending ""when"" and ""if"" questions.

There aren't many guidelines for dealing with BPD because it can distort our thoughts so profoundly. I often feel lost when I start splitting on my partner. The best I can do is wait until I feel calm enough, then talk to them about it.",Oriqamii,False,1715979588.0

You are not overreacting, I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist for about 6 months and have been going through something similar. I have a friend who is a pwBPD, and we‚Äôve had a few conversations similar to what your issue is. My therapist tells me I have to make sure I‚Äôm getting what I need from the friendship and set boundaries because I deserve an equal and fulfilling friendship. When I‚Äôve expressed to my therapist that the friendship is taking a toll on me she suggests to lower my expectations and consider whether the friendship is worth continuing, which are good things to keep in mind.",racarr07,False,1715976910.0
1cuemat,"I'm sorry you're going through this. Navigating a friendship with someone who suffers from BPD is tricky, especially when you‚Äôre dealing with your own mental health struggles.

I have some ideas, but I do want to be mindful of the human factor in all of this. At the end of the day, your friend is a different person than me. I don't know how well off she is in her recovery. 

Try to understand her perspective. People with BPD often struggle with intense emotions, fear of abandonment, and difficulties in maintaining consistent communication. Her periods of silence may not be a reflection of her feelings towards you, but rather a result of her own internal battles.

Communicate your feelings to her. When the timing feels right, have an open and honest conversation with her about how her long periods of silence affect you. I like to think of this as a heart to heart conversation. Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings. 

For example:

I feel hurt and confused when I don't hear from you for months and then we pick up as if nothing happened.

Set boundaries. Establishing boundaries is important for your own well-being. Decide what you are comfortable with in terms of communication and interaction. For example, you could let her know that while you understand she needs space, you also need some form of acknowledgment during the silent periods, even if it's a brief message. 

Adjust your expectations of the friendship based on what you know about her condition and her behavior. Understand that her inconsistency in communication is likely not personal, but a manifestation of her mental health struggles with BPD. It doesn't diminish how you feel, but it is a possible explanation. Some relationships are just limited that way. 

Take care of your own mental health. Engage in activities that help you relax and feel good about yourself. Seek support. I personally prefer my therapist because I appreciate her insight. You can‚Äôt change your friend's behavior, but you can control how you respond to it. Practice mindfulness and grounding techniques to help manage your own emotional responses when you feel rejected or ignored.

Remember, at the end of the day, it‚Äôs important to prioritize your own mental health and well-being. By setting boundaries, communicating openly, and seeking support, you can navigate this friendship in a way that respects both your needs and hers. It can be done.",ladyhaly,False,1716002774.0

She worries, based on substantial past evidence, that people, including you, will break up with her, stop being friends with her, cut her out of their lives, fire her form her job, etc. She cares about you a lot and wants to live with you someday and other stuff, but sometimes her mind just explodes from past trauma or current upsetting things. Adrenaline rushes really help her have a normal state of emotional chemicals balancing in her brain. She‚Äôs that far from having the typical amounts of some chemicals during normal situations that it takes something drastic to bring those chemicals up to a healthy amount. She probably isn‚Äôt really ok with 100% sticking to safety rules all the time, regardless of chemicals (neither am I. If someone wants to rape people, that simply does not mean I‚Äôll never go out and enjoy the city at night with no stress about safety, like I love to do), and she probably shouldn‚Äôt be putting herself into situations where she feels unsafe, like meeting that guy, but she‚Äôs probably into excitement (it‚Äôs sorta like an adrenaline rush) and respecting people who maybe society just doesn‚Äôt always respect, and she should find some safe ways for excitement and safe ways to show unconditional respect to those people and other people. LSD and weed probably fulfill one or more emotional needs she has and she needs to find a safer way to work this out (not something that has a risk of suicide). She‚Äôs worried that you‚Äôll break up with her or you don‚Äôt enjoy her and so she asks for reassurance. She may struggle with emotional permanence (that‚Äôs knowing an emotional thing exists when you‚Äôre not currently observing it; for example, knowing that someone loves you or knowing that someone wants to date you or even wants to keep you hired at your job or wants to be friends with you). She DOES want you to have a happy life and a fulfilling life outside of her, but her mind says ‚ÄúThat means he‚Äôd be perfectly fine without me. That means he‚Äôs more likely to break up with me. That means I‚Äôm worthless as I‚Äôm not needed for a person to have a fulfilling life.‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt want you to have to be on call for anybody all the time, but her mind thinks, ‚ÄúIf he delays answering my calls, that means I‚Äôm a lower priority.‚Äù She thinks things that aren‚Äôt to her liking are fine for other people who like them, but those things give her stress and anxiety, or worsen the stress or anxiety that‚Äôs already too heavy in a healthier moment.",BrianaNanaRama,False,1715981838.0

**You can choose to stay only if she starts getting help and stop the self destructive behavior**. Be very clear about this boundary.

I look to how peculiar things are for me with sex and romance, when and how and with who I experience it with. So the term gray asexuality (gray-A) seemed very comfortable for me.

Now, from a BPD perspective, is it possible you lean toward asexuality (eg demisexual) but use sex as a coping mechanism to satisfy an urgent need for validation? Returning to being less interested in it once you've been validated. It could be that you think you're not worthy of x, y, z (a classic BPD trait) and each new person or new thing for you keeps proving to you that you.

1cu9vv0,"It sounds like he was trying to take the fact that you are feeling lonely and rejected into consideration BY asking you if you're ok today with him going to his usual video game sessions as he's clearly noticed your mood had been different lately, and he's trying to be accomodating and offer that time to you instead of just directly go into it without first asking if you're ok with it, which shows a higher degree of consideration and an awareness that you're feeling more lonely than usual. Im sure of course he still wants too have his his usual decompression time if possible, so it would make sense to just ask, instead of assuming one way or the other what to do. We often assume others need to be mind readers to meet our needs, and that's really not ok. Even though it would be very fucking lovely. 

I could see how he'd feel dejected and frustrated enough to get to a point of saying something regrettable, because it sure seems to me like he was recognizing that you were feeling lonely and rejected and his pause to ask for permission was the recognition of that. 

Saying something regrettable in the heat of the moment should be something all of us are very familiar with in our disorder or at least in in the capacity in the disorder itself. I'm sure many of us, if not you yourself, have said much worse things than saying someone is acting disgusting in the moment.

From his point of view, if he felt he felt he was trying to show he was giving you extra consideration and putting the decision to spend time with him in your hands if you needed it or send him on his way to play video games, and instead what he got out of it was a fight and accusations of being the complete opposite person, if not worse, than what his intentions were walking in the door... it's not hard to see a partner finding disgusting in that kind of reception to their efforts. 

I know that's probably pretty hard to have a compassionate understanding for as we are always thinking about how much we require a great deal of compassionate understanding ourselves. But it's very difficult as an outsider loving a person with BPD and they tend to need frequent, gentle, non threatening reminders to educate themselves in the disorder, where our behaviors and beliefs come from, the kind of tactics and approaches needed with us, and the level of pain and anguish we face with average day to day experiences that wouldn't otherwise phase them. 

It's always always a solid recommendation to get into couples therapy for anyone in a relationship with BPD. Effective communication is always going to be a struggle and a third party is critical in bridging the gap and validating both halves of the couple. There is a predictable well known cycle that happens in borderline relationships that you can Google and becoming aware of that can help you learn to expect the phases of the cycle. It's also good to learn about attachment theory and each other's attachment styles and how they relate to one another. 

Finally, if you're not in treatment, that not ok and it's a huge disservice to yourself and not at all fair to your husband to shoulder the burden of the symptoms of the disorder like that. The fact that you were unable to see his intention in asking you if it was ok as considerate and instead saw it as the opposite, and the fact that one fight led you to believe your marriage has now doomed you to a life of loneliness because of one harsh criticism that, to me, seemed at least half way fair, if only just a bit harsh like i said, though i have to wonder how harsh you were yourself when things exploded. And the fact that in the very first place there seemed to be an expectation for him to read your mind. It really sounds like he might be trying more than youre giving him credit for. And that you have a lot of work to do. There's a lot of splitting going on outside of just that fight. This disorder is very treatable. Remission isn't just possible, it is the likely course.

Stop expecting him to know your wants and needs, speak clearly and directly to him, take him asking permission as consideration for you, get into couples therapy, learn about the BPD relationship cycle, attachment styles, and step up your treatment, it sounds like it's time to do an IOP. 6-8 weeks will give you and him both a great reduction in symptom severity. 

A happy healthy marriage is still possible, don't expect it to be easy or effortless. Expect it to be one of the hardest efforts of your life, but if you want it, you will see the results very quickly. Just sit with your discomfort and ask to be challenged.",Technical_Slide1515,False,1716046490.0

There's a book by Blaise Aguirre, MD and Gillian Galen, PsyD called Coping with BPD and its been helping my wife and I better understand each other and have hard conversations. I recommend using the SCREW method for immediate distress tolerance and allow you to run through your options before acting. 

S: solve the problem; Express gratitude for him asking in the first place, request that he asks more or spends more time with you as compromise, stick to the facts and if things get heated apologize and learn to step away to calm down.

C: change your relationship to the problem; challenge your perspective of the situation, you might think, ""does he even love me anymore?"" Or, ""doesn't he know how I feel?"" Challenge those ideas. What does love look like, sound like, feel like for you? Tell him that. Did you tell him how you feel? If not then there is no way for him to know. If you did is he showing understanding or is he invalidating your feelings? Talk about the facts when communicating. 

R: radically accept the problem; accept that you had a fight and cant take it back. Learn to let go of what happened and make a plan for future responses. You cannot control what is in the past and that is okay. Take time to healthily work on yourself instead of focusing on your relationship. If he loves you he'll be there tomorrow when you've bettered yourself.

*THESE LAST TWO DONT LEAD TO DESIREABLE OUTCOMES. THEY ARE KNEE-JERK REACTIONS AND NOT SKILLFULL BUT GIVE YOU A WAY OF UNDERSTANDING THAT YOUR THINKING MIGHT NOT BE LOGICAL.*

E: entertain misery; tell yourself how horrible your relationship is and ruminate about the problem. Continue to think about how he doesn't love you and refuses to understand you. Staying miserable is an option that keeps you miserable. 

W: worsen the situation; scream at him about how he doesn't seem to care any other time he plays video games and ask, ""why give a shit now?"" Tell him he's a horrible person who doesn't care about you. Find a guy on tinder or at the bar and let him have his way with you so your partner knows it's over. Drink, do drugs, and break laws because if he doesn't care why should you? 

Obviously the last two options are extreme exaggerations of reality but might not be far off the mark for others. Its important to understand that while getting help is hard and painful, you can have a bright future. You can make hard decisions. I recommend getting into therapy if you're not already.

Also remember, in the Netherlands at least they told me they do not diagnose minors with BPD because they don't want to label them with something so strong while they are still developing sooo exponentially. I am 19F, was diagnosed with ""perhaps BPD in development"" at 17, I thought I wasn't going to make it up until now, but here I am. I am doing reaalllyy bad this week, but it is so much more managable than it was when I was 16. I am constantly in my head about everything and so insecure and so unstable and on the verge of bad things, but I am coping much more easily than I did back then. You will be too. I also have good weeks and good days and those days are easier to get through, with much less anxiety about it getting bad again and much more chillings throughout my day.

I don't know if this does anything to you, I enjoy scientific evidence about getting better, because it feels more legit, but I can imagine it just feels like a bunch of facts to you. Hopefully you get something hopeful/comforting out of my message :)   
(And please do not come to the conclusion that you will change for the worse, the odds are absolutely in your favor (veeryyy much in your favor), chances of you getting worse are small)/

You are also just going through it, you're just a kid and I mean that in the least condescending way possible as I feel like a kid myself as well all the time, I barely can believe I made it to 19 sometimes. We are so young and still everchanging, the chances of you developing in a healthy way are in your favor, it's just science.

This is also no advice, just simply stating facts. You are not staying the same forever and that is absolutely a good thing and so important to remember especially on the very bad days.

Sorry, long message, but I remember feeling like you did and it made it especially hard being alone, so if you ever wanna talk, hit me up :)",Nicolex13m,False,1715981244.0

Criterion 9: During periods of extreme stress, transient paranoid ideation or dissociative symptoms (e.g., depersonalization) may occur, but these are generally of insufficient severity or duration to warrant an additional diagnosis. These episodes occur most frequently in response to a real or imagined abandonment. Symptoms tend to be transient, lasting minutes or hours. The real or perceived return of the caregiver‚Äôs nurturance may result in a remission of symptoms.

Associated Features: Some individuals develop psychotic-like symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, body-image distortions, ideas of reference, hypnagogic phenomena) during times of stress.

Regardless, some self regulation things you can do is to try to "" replace "" the image of people conspiring against you with the image of people just existing non maliciously. 

So for example if you're scared someone is judging you because they looked at you in a weird way, tell yourself that they looked at you because they wanted to get a better look at your hairstyle, that they just happened to look in your direction, or that they were zoned out. 

Something that can also help is to put yourself in the position of the people you think might be trying to hurt you. Would you seek to harm someone else? The answer is most likely no. This doesn't always work though especially with cluster B disorders where the answer might be yes.

1cu3p76,"It's understandable that you're feeling uncomfortable with your girlfriend's late-night hangouts with her FP. It is a challenge ‚Äî but also an opportunity. Addressing this issue thoughtfully and respectfully can help you both feel more secure and connected in your relationship.

**Express Your Feelings:** 
Have a calm and honest conversation with your girlfriend. Choose a time when both of you are relaxed and not distracted. Step away from Reddit. Use ""I"" statements to communicate your feelings. For example:

I feel uneasy when you stay out so late with your FP because it seems excessive and intimate to me.

Emphasize that your concern is about the timing, not a lack of trust. This approach helps to avoid sounding accusatory and focuses on your feelings. Remember that when someone is being accused, it is natural to get defensive. You're not trying to win. You're trying to work together. 

**Avoid Ultimatums:** 
Instead of making demands, express your desire to find a compromise. For instance, suggest earlier hangout times or set a mutually agreeable curfew.

You could say:

I know how much you enjoy spending time with your FP, but could we find a way for you to come home earlier, like around midnight? It would make me feel more comfortable.

Be open to her suggestions and find a middle ground that respects both of your needs.

**Understand Her Perspective:** 
Ask her to share why these late night hangouts are important to her. Show genuine interest in her feelings and experiences.

You can ask questions like:

- What do you enjoy most about your late-night hangouts with your FP?

- Is there a reason why these hangouts tend to go so late?

Understanding her viewpoint can help you empathise with her needs and find a solution that works for both of you.

**Set Boundaries Together:** 
Establish boundaries that respect both your feelings and her need for social time. Discuss what boundaries would make each of you feel comfortable and supported.

For example, you might agree on a specific time she should be home or set aside dedicated time for the two of you to spend together. This collaborative approach can strengthen your relationship by ensuring that both of you feel heard and respected.

**Regular Check-Ins:** 
After setting boundaries, plan regular check-ins to see how both of you are feeling about the arrangement.

This can be as simple as messaging over texts going like:

How are you feeling about our new agreement on hangout times?

Regular check-ins provide an opportunity to adjust the boundaries if needed and to ensure that both of you feel satisfied and secure.

Ultimately, it's about finding a balance that respects both your needs and maintains trust. Communication and compromise are key. By working together to address your concerns, you can strengthen your relationship and build a foundation of mutual respect and understanding.",ladyhaly,False,1715950350.0

His behaviour was incredibly manipulative and it seems like a lot of it was meant to hurt you. While BPD can play a part in that, letting you think he was dead/dying for hours is awful. So is him purposefully making you jealous and laughing at you, breaking up with you in front of his friends. Giving him the most benefit of the doubt, he maybe felt that you hurting because of him was the only way he could believe you cared about him, which is still awful, and you cannot fix him. If you got back with him, he would feel enabled to continue this behaviour. 

In my experience, when I made suicidal threats, it was because I was in terrible emotional pain in the moment, and I needed to be cared for. The need and pain was immediate. It wouldn‚Äôt need to be met with hours of suffering from the other person.

I wish him all the best, and like I said in previous posts I hope he can find his footing again and go onto a good path of recovery, get back on his medication and learn and grow from his trauma.

I then hope in the future he can find love again and have a good long happy life, I hope me loving him and supporting him 100% makes him realise he can find that again in the future when he‚Äôs ready.

Listen - I do not want to scare you. Some people with BPD can make amazing partners, they can be incredibly loyal and would never imagine cheating. Some people with BPD struggle a lot with cheating, because they get so much validation from attention and thus can seek it out in inappropriate ways.

A symptom of BPD is not having a strong sense of self. Even though you can look at her and you see who she is, chances are she doesn't know who she is. BPD can make people do spontaneous/impulsive things but so does ADHD. With ADHD dopamine receptors in your brain don't quite work right which leads people to do things that make them feel good.

Just because it's possibly a symptom of ADHD doesn't mean that it isn't genuine. Being genuine is *meaning* what you're doing.

Whether she's dopamine seeking or she misses you and is anxious about it, her visiting you and showing you affection is most likely genuine. Obviously I can never actually speak for another person but even if someone's neurodivergence can guide their decisions good or bad but it doesn't stop being their decision. No matter their sense of self. If it's genuine to her, just because there's a guiding factor shouldn't it still be genuine to you?

At the end of the day you should try and talk to her about it, gently obviously if it still eats at you a bit.

That's a perspective issue on your part. You see her through the lens of what you view as ""normal."" Try viewing the world through her lens, which she cannot control.

All that said, I know that this is a genuine concern for those who dont have or understand the disorder, but maybe it‚Äôs time for you to start learning more about BPD and OCD. It‚Äôll help you, your partner, and ultimately your relationship as a whole. Take time to understand what it actually means to be diagnosed with any of her disorders from HER perspective, besides just your own. 
I would also suggest talking about your love languages with her. Tell her what kinds of things make you feel loved, and ask her what kinds of things you can do to make her feel loved. Is it acts of service? Hers may be grand gestures and thats why she comes up to you on a whim‚Äîobviously you may not be able to do things like that often, but maybe try to surprise her with a trip every once in a while. A lot of the time, people will use their own love languages to express love to others, and while thats super great and sweet, it can be misunderstood by their partners who don‚Äôt necessarily feel loved in those ways. I notice that this is an even greater issue in BPD couples because the one without the diagnosis will get nervous because of things like that and whatnot.

The manipulation is mostly us being emotional trying to get our needs met and partly us toxically testing people. It really is mostly us expressing our intense emotions and it coming across as manipulation. Being quiet means we repress our outburst of emotions and instead of taking them out on people we hurt ourselves.

1cttcbp,"I‚Äôve heard some say this is an accurate description of some of it. 

Gunderson on the Element of Interpersonal Hypersensitivity: ‚ÄúPeople with BPD are born with a genetic disposition to be highly sensitive and reactive to their caretakers. They are more apt to attribute rejection or anger to parental behaviors than are other children. They have usually grown up feeling that they were unfairly treated and that they did not get the attention or care they needed. They resent this and, as young adults, they hope to establish a relationship with someone who can make up to them for what they feel is missing. The desired relationship is exclusive, setting in motion intense reactions to real or perceived slights, rejections, or separations. Predictably, both their unrealistic expectations and their intense reactions cause such relationships to fail. When this happens, people with BPD will feel rejected or abandoned, and they cannot resolve their anger about being treated unfairly and their fear that they are bad and deserve the rejection. Both conclusions can lead them to become self-destructive. Their anger about being mistreated, their shame about being bad, or their self-destructive behaviors can evoke guilt or protective feelings in others. Such guilt or rescuing responses from others validate the borderline person‚Äôs unrealistically negative perceptions of mistreatment and sustain their unrealistically high expectations of having their needs met. Thus, the cycle is apt to repeat itself.‚Äù",aperyu-1,False,1715909617.0

1ctt1ay,"Hey there,

I completely understand how you might be feeling, and I want to share some thoughts that might help.

Firstly, I dislike calling BPD a ""disorder."" Anyone who has had to endure and survive the traumas that people with BPD and CPTSD (which I have symptoms of) have experienced would respond in similar ways. These mechanisms, which seem ""disordered"" to the general population and even some medical professionals, were once vital for survival. They evolved from immense amounts of adversity, abandonment, and neglect, almost like unwanted gifts necessary for enduring traumatic times.

Allow yourself the grace of knowing that you're moving through a process that begins with sometimes painful awareness. This awareness can eventually lead to the gift of desperation, where you realize you deserve better from the world and, importantly, from within yourself.

Relationships can often break a trauma survivor more than they ""make"" or heal us, especially when we seek in a potential partner the love, respect, care, spiritual nourishment, and identity that we should have received in infancy and childhood. I've found help not only in EMDR and brain spotting therapies but also in journeys within myself to discover who I truly am. Through this process, I've found a promising, joyful, grateful, and humbly beautiful person within myself.

Dialoguing with my inner child began as a tearful experience but has evolved into a system of self-assurance, encouragement, and validation. Remember, you deserve better, and the journey to finding that starts within you.

It's also important to surround yourself with supportive people who understand and respect your journey. Building a network of friends or joining support groups can provide the connection and empathy that are essential for healing. And don't forget to celebrate your progress, no matter how small it may seem. Every step forward is a testament to your strength and resilience.

Stay strong and take care. Wishing you well. üôèüèΩ",Affectionate-Comb807,False,1715920134.0

1ctsqm3,"I relate to this so much!!! Sometimes it really feels like BPD is just the pathologizing of trauma (rooted in misogyny but s/o to my non-Afab BPDers out there).

But I think that‚Äôs why I try to remind myself that it honestly doesn‚Äôt matter that much if it‚Äôs BPD related or not. At the end of the day this diagnosis is just someone throwing a bunch of symptoms together under an umbrella. You had the symptoms before the diagnosis and you‚Äôll have them after, the important part is addressing them. So instead of saying ‚Äúis this just my BPD? Am I acting crazy or is this justified?‚Äù Maybe instead ask yourself ‚ÄúI feel this way for a reason and it‚Äôs trying to tell me something. How can I respond in a way that is aligned with my values?‚Äù 

Obviously that‚Äôs easier said than done (and this is thick coming from me because I struggle with this all the time) but I think it‚Äôs actually easier to step back and control our very uncontrollable behaviors when we validate the fact that it doesn‚Äôt really matter if it‚Äôs BPD or not, it just matters that you‚Äôre feeling like doing something harmful for a reason and there might be a way to handle it that addresses that reason better than the harmful behavior. Because your feelings ARE valid and the things you did, even the toxic ones, DO make sense even if they might not have been the right thing to do. And that doesn‚Äôt really change whether or not it‚Äôs the BPD talking. 

Good luck!! I‚Äôm rooting for you and I understand how you feel. So many aspects of our lives are genuinely unfair and hurtful and it‚Äôs so difficult to handle. I hope you‚Äôre doing okay üíñ",SugarCoated111,False,1715919714.0

August 30th, 2018.. I was asleep in bed facing away from my ex boyfriend. My FP. He was sitting/leaning with his back against the wall so his feet were propped up against my back. 

Out of nowhere I remember starting to realize that there was pressure on my back and that I was moving. By the time I was awake, I was on the floor already gasping for air. He had launched me out of our bed with his feet which had bowed my back at a weird angle. I hit an amplifier on the way to the floor as well as a desk. 

The next thing I knew, he was standing over me screaming and kicking me, choking me, pulling my hair, spitting in my face. When I was able I curled into a ball to protect my face. 

We lived with his parents. It's a good thing too, because he wouldn't have stopped except that his mother physically forced her way between us. She witnessed at least some of the event, probably heard more. 

I left the next morning as soon as he left the house I waited 5 minutes got in my car, and went to a friend's house. 

I never filed charges against my ex because at the time I was still in love with him, and also because I didn't want his mother to end up having to bail him out of stuff again when she saved my life. I have regrets about not pressing charges against him but it's too late to do it now.

It took me months to get a diagnosis. Severe spinal stenosis with degenerative joint disorder and a severely pinched sciatic nerve. Even before my emergency surgery I walked with a cane or had to use a wheelchair. My mobility was severely affected by this event. Every doctor I talked to knows the truth about my injury. I've never hidden anything from the doctors so it should be noted somewhere. 

Thursday, I started experiencing something I came to find out was called foot drop or drop foot. Basically I couldn't lift my right leg at all it was like lead. I went to ER Friday morning and found out I had developed something called Cauda Equina Syndrome, which requires immediate emergency surgery. 

It was a 7 hour procedure (spinal decompression at 3 levels) with some complications. I was released to go home yesterday morning and my recovery is still uncertain. It's looking like around 3 months with lots of physical therapy. I may never regain feeling in my right leg or my privates. Luckily surgery saved me from incontinence and paralysis. 

I think about that mother fucker every single day and I wish all the worst things on him. I don't think there's anything wrong with obsessing over a situation or a person who hurt you. It's a learning experience and your brain is trying to prevent it from happening again.

My dad passed on X-mas, and I had made a friend in a FB BPD group. He was like a 24hr day, or night friend, who also got along with my husband. He was there for me throughout some EXTREMELY hard times‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt until February that I noticed he was a HUGE Andrew Tate fan. Very shortly after, he told me my ‚Äúcomplaint card‚Äù, re. Husband, had been revoked. He then put me on a call with some other chick, and talked badly about me (or, rather, got her to‚Äù, and I asked him to please block me because I knew I couldn‚Äôt. He said he never blocks. The next day, when we were messaging, said‚Äî‚ÄúNo hard feelings when I do this‚Äù, then unfriended me. He WANTED me to see what he had done; this was late February. 

Flash forward to a few weeks ago, I hit him up through TikTok. I was so pushed to get him to block me, that I opened Pandora‚Äôs box that I convinced him to add me back on FB. A HUGE part of me missed him, but the other was still enraged about how he treated me. I had another BPD friend jump into a group chat, and she saw him for what he was, and started going low‚Ä¶still I would try and defend him, even knowing he could give two shyt‚Äôs less about me. He then lied to her about caring about me, so I split, and took all the lowest shots I could about him and his life (24hr FT buddy for MONTHS, so I had lots of tea)‚Ä¶finally got him to block me like he said he never would.

Part of me felt like I ‚Äòwon‚Äô, but then the emotional burning of loss came right back. This time he blocked me on everything, and I have still checked more than once. üò≠",WhoAmEyeReally,False,1715962394.0

1ctomt5,"This topic gets posted regularly enough i'm surprised it's not pinned or something. This is from a favorite meta analysis regarding BPD and ASD overlap, published in 2023 with the data of 127 collective studies:

According to a recent literature review, around 50% of subjects with ASD may also meet the diagnostic criteria for at least one PD. In particular, some papers stressed how PDs seem to be a fairly common misdiagnosis among unrecognized ASD adults while other authors highlighted a high rate of comorbidities between these two kinds of disorders. Among PDs, borderline personality disorder (BPD) is one of the most investigated in the literature due to its higher prevalence with respect to other PDs as well as its associated clinical challenges. 

Although the two disorders may seem quite different, recent literature increasingly reported significant overlaps. The two disorders mainly differentiate for the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, as well as an alteration in sensory processing that, while being necessary for the diagnosis of ASD, it is not required for that of BPD. On the other hand, while BPD is characterized by a pervasive instability of relationship and self-image, feelings of emptiness and desperate efforts to avoid abandonment, those are not required features for a diagnosis of ASD. Moreover, the two disorders often report different triggers of emotional upset. For example, in ASD emotional outbursts may be triggered by changes in the daily routine or by a cognitive or sensitive overload, while in BPD by attachment issues.

On the other hand, interestingly, several studies have suggested similarities between BPD and ASD symptoms and traits. For example, intense relationships and superficial friendships, as well as the tendency of acting out instead of verbalizing emotions, even if they are typical features of BPD, are also common in ASD. ASD subjects also reported consistent rates of self-injurious behaviors, which is another feature shared with BPD. Similarly, impairment in verbal and non-verbal communications, social functioning, erroneous assumptions about motives and emotional meltdowns, while being core features of ASD, are also frequently reported in BPD subjects.

Furthermore, a variety of studies have reported that not only could many BPD traits be considered a consequence of emotional dysregulation, a dimension also largely represented in ASD subjects, but also that people with BPD show difficulties in identifying, distinguishing and integrating their emotions with those of other individuals. While impaired social and relational areas may be a common core for ASD and BPD, some authors stressed in BPD subjects difficulties in the ToM (Theory of Mind) similar to those typical of ASD subjects. This is particularly relevant since altered social perception and altered functioning of more sophisticated neurocognitive skills such as ToM and associated mentalizing (i.e., the capacity to predict another person‚Äôs conduct based on their mental state) may lead, in both BPD and ASD patients, to emotional disturbances, and impulsive and self-destructive behaviors. 

Additionally, both BPD and ASD symptoms have been reported to improve after therapeutic interventions that target emotion recognition, mentalizing and empathy, such as ToM and mentalization-based psychotherapy and oxytocin intranasal administration. A possible explanation for this concordance could be that the neurocognitive aspects of ASD that are impaired, such as mentalizing, impulse control, empathy and communication, may have a major influence on how personality develops.",Technical_Slide1515,False,1715908549.0

Thats when i saw my own behaviour and realised i probably adhd, which I have, including Autism. But then I saw some very undeniable signs of BPD later in her. 

I believe it's possible to have a combination of both, I believe, if your family tree has quite intelligent people in it, these things are often genetic, so definitely, you could have autism in your genes, and BPD  also. Sometimes people with ADHD and people with BPD fall in love and have chilfmdren, so any combination of things can be passed on. 

There is a reason why me and her clicked on a deeper level, but I am far more naive than her, by far lol. She feels i was easily confused (guilty, bingo), Late diagnosis with myself, I think we bond over the emotional issues and confusion at the world of both undiagnosed, untreated ADHD/asd and untreated BPD.

The best way I found, after decades of people calling my symptoms, is general anxiety disorder, I finally just went and did an assessment, which was 2 days of interviews and tests. 

Clinical psychologists are very good at what they do. They will see what's going on with you. Mine spotted the ASD pretty quickly. 

Good luck with it, and remember that Asd (autism) is a gift, not a disorder, I've been told many times since my diagnosis that they simply call it a disorder because the outside world is very disordered and it clashes with us a lot. Society is like a bull in a china store.  To people with ASD, they don't entirely get us and how easily our intelligence can be overlooked and misunderstood. On ADHD medication my ASD is very quick on its feet. It's the  intelligent, puzzle solving side of me. 

75% of people with ADHD also have high functioning autism. 2 things that can seem similar to BPD, the recklessness and not so great judgement at times.  So, I'd invest some time into finding  out who you are, like I did. It made a world of difference.

Without knowledge, we can't possibly 
Direct ourselves in the right direction. Knowledge gives you a map. ""Okay, this is my ADHD at play. Okay, this is my ASD at play. Okay, this is my at at play."" And you can work on each issue's traits in a clearer way.

1ctomt5,"I didn't randomly slap a label on anyone, just pointed out a fact...

And Schizotypal disorder is a Cluster A PD, not a Cluster C one, and under the ICD it's a schizophrenia condition foremost and a PD secondary.


Schizotypal disorder causes transient psychosis resulting in sensory aberration and occasional delusion/hallucination; other general 'positive' schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms (ideas of reference, magical thinking); 'negative' schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms (avolition, Anderssein, depression); disorganised schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms (speech and memory deficits); ASD symptoms (developmental delays, palilalia and extended echolalia, motor tics, stims, a degree of diminished theory of mind, solitary nature, elaborate inner world and set-shifting difficulties); attention-deficit, and Borderline symptoms (identity disturbance, impulsivity, self-sabotaging behaviours etc.) The transient psychosis in Schizotypal Disorder is basically identical to the peripheral psychosis experienced in BPD under stress, just *not* happening only in stressful moments.


Before Schizotypal disorder existed as a diagnosis (pre 1978) most people who had it were diagnosed with BPD (or Borderline Psychosis/Syndrome as it was then), because they're so alike. And both the DSM and ICD state that Schizotypal Disorder should never be diagnosed comorbid with ASD because they're considered to be so similar that misidiagnosis is almost definitely happening if someone is diagnosed with both (they're still not decided on whether it's possible to have both).


Schizotypal Disorder is unlike any other schizophrenia-spectrum condition in that it starts from 3-4 years old and is a developmental condition just like ASD. Sufferers experience developmental delays with movement (poor movement control and planning), language (lalling, echolalia and palilalia, phonetic delay), and commonly experience beyond average intelligence compared to peers in one or more developmental tasks used to assess children at that age. They experience an anxious sense of difference from others and struggle to form relationships. There are studies entirely about trying to better distinguish between ASD and schizotypal disorder in children.

The literature/data is not there. Not beyond early childhood which would not really be taken into consideration as PDs aren't really a thing to be diagnosed in 4 year olds. For people of age or coming of age, the differential diagnosis between ASD and schizotypal PD is a very easy thing to delineate. The overlap isn't really there. And the literature supports as much. As an autistic person and someone who's spending 20+ hours a week on combing through neuropsychology and neuropsychopharmacology research, this is kind of... offensive?  Not that it's offensive to be lumped with schizotypal PD, that's a non issue, i have PDNOS because of schizoid traits which i know is not at all the same thing, as really testing is in tact, but outs frustrating when your education is basically reduced to ""i don't have to prove my personal opinion i'm stating as fact to you"" when, actually, yes, the burden of proof is actually on you.

And i did say schizotypals differ from pwBPD and ASD in that there is a lack of interest and extreme discomfort and sometimes even paranoia with forming connections with others or social interactions. Where as BPD and ASD typically retains a larger amount of desire to form these relationships, there's just a struggle in doing so. Not to say schizotypal PDs can't have the desire, it is just not typically going to be seen as a common trait at all. BPD and ASD it exists enough to be considered common. 

If you make a statement you want to insist is factual and true, the burden of proof is on you, always, and you shouldn't be shirking any emotional labor on to anyone else to prove otherwise. I already provided a link that doesn't make things look good for what you're trying to say, unless there's a lot of context missing. I just don't understand why or what the point is of jumping out of ther bushes and saying ""ahhh but did you know schizotypal PD and ASD also overlap and are often misdiagnosed as well!!"" Because, as it seems, they aren't, at all. Your case holds up for 2-4 year olds, though. Any older, the delineation is easy.

The DSM made official BPD in the third edition when it separated StPD and BPD, but that is only correlation. I have my own issues with personality disorders as a whole, diagnostic criteria in general especially the DSM, and it should come as no surprise that we could absolutely easily fit the diagnostic criteria of another PD.

1). I never said that the onus wasn't on my to evidence it. I just don't particularly care at the moment. I'm not asking you to believe me.


2). I also never said that ASD and StPD were entirely congruent. That's a very weird point to even feel like you have to make... Though, your mention of traits of Schizoidia is a good reminder that ASD and the schizophrenia-spectrum overlap in certain places.


3). StPD is actually marked by the sufferer usually retaining their desire to form relationships (you're confusing this with schizoidia, where a primary feature is it being absent). You're wrong there.


4). The misdiagnosis rate was impossible to fully quantify, for a start (as even the APA and WHO don't have a full idea of just how bad it was), however, it was considered to be so inevitable that both implemented clauses into their respective manuals. The DSM-V actually states that, if both StPD and ASD criteria are met, only ASD should be diagnosed (which is interesting, because that includes transient psychosis), while the ICD-11 states the opposite and diagnoses schizotypal disorder over ASD (which I agree more with, personally).


5). Actually, childhood diagnosis *is* an important discussion when it comes to schizotypal disorder. It's one of the primary criticisms of its DSM variation (with the PD classification encouraging adulthood-only diagnosis), and the APA have been pushed over the past decade or so to put more of a focus onto childhood schizotypy. It has been known for decades that StPD actually develops as a developmental condition akin to ASD and it's one of the ICD's strengths that it has never discouraged diagnosis in children. It's the only schizophrenia-spectrum condition to do so. The University Of Melbourne created their own assessment (MASK) for scoring childhood schizotypy to accompany Raine's SPQ (before Raine switched lanes and became a biological criminologist, he spent the former part of the 1990s academically helping schizotypal disorder).


In fact, because you've reminded me of it (and I know where it is without having to go hunting), you should see [this essay](https://academic.oup.com/schizbullopen/article/1/1/sgaa048/5903520) on the convoluted history of *childhood* schizotypy alone and how it has, in the authors' (and my) view, been grossly neglected over time. You might find it interesting to see that the authors also note that Borderline Syndrome was, at one point, a suggested classification for young people showing traits of schizotypal disorder. There's also a very nice section dedicated to schizotypal disorder and ASD (some studies finding that 40% of people diagnosed with ASD could equally be diagnosed with StPD).


Oh and I found [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22686870/) on the way as well. Almost completely random, but a little interesting.


And [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18554872/) actually if you want to follow that one. Turns out I had a few things saved somewhere.


I miss back when I was doing psychiatry and psychotherapy and had better access to these research databases.


I've had noticeable schizotypal disorder (diagnosed) since I was 4, was *almost* misdiagnosed with ASD, was actually misdiagnosed with ADHD, was almost misdiagnosed with ASD *again* at 24 years old until a more senior psychiatrist recognised my schizotypy, and then had my BPD overlap noted (and was given DBT to help reduce things like mood shifts, self harm and suicidal inclinations, idealisation and resentment, codependency and relationship paranoia etc.) while also 24.",Hi_There_Im_Sophie,False,1715987238.0
1ctomt5,"Right, but the connection between StPD and BPD is clearly more pronounced than just 'you can fit the criteria for another disorder as well'. Honestly, you sound quite disingenuous in out engagement here.


The fact that StPD was being misdiagnosed as BPD (or, it's earlier incarnation) at all speaks volumes, and then academics argued that it should *remain* a form of BPD. Even now, BPD is one of the most prevalent comorbid conditions for StPD and one that clinicians are taught to rule out before diagnosing StPD. Symptoms of BPD appear prevalently in Schizotypal Disorder (which was my original point, and still hasn't been falsified).


I mean, you sound like you're just not a big fan of being associated with it. Furthermore, you've presented basically nothing.


Likewise, symptoms of ASD appear in Schizotypal disorder.

In 3 years i'll be giving neuropsych evals if i keep self actualizing my shit. Maybe it's projection? Either way, woof, someone is feeling the need to get petty and that is never a good sign.

Anyways... 

After reading the entire comment, i understand more, this is biased experience, that's all. It's unfortunate how rampant personal bias is passed around as bonafide fact. I'm sure i've not been completely immune either, but idk, maybe my compulsive fact checking is rarer than i'd have ever guessed.

1. I never said you stated that. I stated that. Because it's just true. The burden of proof always on the person making the claims. And that's fine in any case. Im satisfied in knowing i haven't missed anything, things are still where they stand in our understanding of these disorders. It's just that a person with a biased opinion and erroneously pushed it as fact. Happens all the time, we're all guilty of getting heated about personal beliefs to the point of our own detriment, im not impervious to that either. 

2. I also never said you stated they were entirely congruent??? I feel like there's been several times now where you've taken things that i've said and applied black and white subtext that does not exist. Schizoidia is not the clinically relevant term used today. Not only does it muddy of meanings with having multiple definitions but it's also(afaik) German and Italian clinical terminology and plenty of these studies, analyses, and reviews aren't in English originally. To say that ASD and actual *schizophrenia* do share *some* overlap is a gross understatement and again speaks to the level of understanding being given. The symptoms of autism first appear during early life while schizophrenic symptoms do not typically appear until adolescence at the earliest. ASD shares many of the negative features of schizophrenia, such as social withdrawal and communication deficiencies, but do not share the positive symptoms, mainly involving hallucinations and delusions. Interestingly, they are of the same etiologies.

3. Again, injecting black and white thinking where there is none. I said ""difficulty *or* lacking desire"" in forming relationships. I could copypasta you to death, too. But you should just go to r/schizotypal and hear it from pwStPD themselves, some lean more schizoid and some lean more avoidant, backing up everything i've stated. Stop blinding yourself with a defensive need to be right. Im only ever just happy to share my literal lifes purpose and work. Reddit is my outlet to get out my enjoyment of learning and teaching, i enjoy just as much receiving and am not above being corrected. I would have been happy to be wrong, i always am. And please understand it is schizoid not schizoidia, that is an outdated term and it's going to out you in the future. 

4. For the love of fucking god, prove it. Prove one single thing you've said one single time. I just pulled my DSM 5 and it is absolutely no where to be written. Its plenty possible to quantify to *some* degree of attainable accuracy. What is even the point of having considered becoming a biostatistician then???

5. No. Just. No. Please, please, please... ahhh... why bother... listen. Children Aren't going to be diagnosed with a personality disorder, not a 4 year old, and that's absolutely fine, because they're still going to receive appropriate supports, interventions, monitoring and diagnoses of one is suspected,  they more or less will be viewed as having one and just staving off the label if possible. There will be a wait and watch approach with other still significant diagnoses given and appropriate interventions at every stage applied. Often times ASD can present with schizotypal *traits* at an early age. A profound difference. And a very important one for the health and the wellbeing of child to be given every opportunity for cognitive improvement without the use of antipsychotic medication as the approach for both disorders is the same in any case especially at such a young age. There is only benefit to be had for a child to be given traits of a personality disorder and early interventions as they are pretty moderately successful. Children can and do see permanent neurodevelopmental improvements with early intervention. Obviously the children who were and shall remain on the schizophrenic spectrum will grow into more positive affects and recieve a more formal diagnosis as they mature and some may retain schizotypal traits and attain SD diagnosis. And yes, there will always be some misdiagnoses. I never said never. It's just, not this common prevalence that BPD and ASD is. Not as a personality disorder. That's the point of the discussion. You wanna talk about traits or prodromal phases and schizophrenia and shit i mean sure yeah, but idk, just, like i said, kind of jumped out of the bushes at me with your presentation. I could see the subject making a very good post on its own.",Technical_Slide1515,False,1716011402.0
1ctomt5,"Your link didn't give me new information, i'm sorry, but thank you, i do like case studies. Childhood schizotypy seems appropriate as ever prior to the application of a personality disorder as the author even noted they can experience remitting symptoms mid-adolescence. Borderline is a term coined for a group of patients whos symptoms did not appear to get better and whos pathology neither entirely fit within the patients experiencing psychosis nor the patients enduring neurosis. I think the loss of understanding with the 40% statistic is within the details that ASD and SDS/SSD really do share the same etiology. The neurobiological(like brain volumes), and genetic (same genes or chromosomal locations) domains support the hypothesis that while they are distinct disorders, they are not entirely unique. Until these disorders came to be viewed as distinct in the 1970s, they were viewed as different phases of the same problem, with autism manifesting as an earlier phase of schizophrenia. The overlap between schizophrenia and autism may be part of a broader set of overlaps between these neurodevelopmental disorders and others, such as ADHD, bipolar disorder and intellectual disability. In this view,  common hereditary risk genetic mutations and rarer risk mutations, together with protective genetic factors and other environmental and biological factors can produce a number of different, diverse disorders that may share certain features in common, but differ along other dimensions. Plenty of literature seems to be suggesting that some individuals may meet diagnostic criteria for autism prior to a psychotic break and development of positive symptoms. I think the author fell short and went outside their area of expertise and into the fractals of information contained in the field log genetics which are massive driving forces for neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD and SSD. They are less like to be comorbid thesev they are to be variables in presentation. The issue lies in who and who does not benefit from medication management. 

Yep. That next link i definitely already covered. You jumped out with StPD being a common missed comorbodity. It is likely just a co-occuring trait of some with ASD or prodromal misdiagnosis, BPD and ASD are truly comorbid.

And I'm sorry, I'm not reading something from 2008, I booked it at ""Axis I.""


Truly, the database i have, in all the archives, there isn't a great argument going on, they're never has been, but i do see an effort in trying have one single reliable assessment to definitively differentiate the two for the purpose of avoiding overprescribing antipsychotics. Though that study still stated(2023) that comorbidity of the two disorders had, to date, still not been described in detail(if you had a basis of understanding for how impressive it is to *not* have data on this). The treatment is actually quite the same for ASD and SSD otherwise. Another search in another archive resulted once more only in children with overlapping schizotypal *traits*.

I'd be curious to know if you've had a neuropsych evaluation yet. Because all of that sounds terribly messy and unsure. Neuropsych evals are the gold standard for differential diagnoses. And doing them is going to pay for my doctorates. I wouldn't at all cr surprised to learn that it would be ASD with schizotypal traits and BPD and ADHD. A common genetic link to autism is a shared risk factor for ther development of both autism and ADHD. There's a reason for the coined term ""AuDHD.""

Is not a misdiagnosis, its the discretion of the diagnostician and the presentation of the patient. They're prevalent because the DSM 3 split the two and only added identity disturbances and feelings of emptiness and labeled it BPD.

Your point isn't been falsified because it's not false, BPD and SD are grossly overlapping to a problematic degree, perhaps the highest problematic degree, so the argument of comorbidities is jumping the gun. First and foremost it is an argument of differential diagnoses if one is to be made.

It sounds like you're just... big mad. I've presented an exhaustive wealth of information to you. You're welcome. You can stop gaslighting me any time.

For most people with bpd, containment makes them regress, a longer hospital stay does them more harm. If you had particular treatment goals for the admission, did you communicate them?¬†

Psychology is definitely the way to go. Where I live, they don‚Äôt like to put people with bpd on holds. If you had absconded, you would have been discharged. If you snuck in shards of glass, you would have been discharged (because you‚Äôd be impacting the safety of other patients). I understand the trauma response but I‚Äôm struggling to understand what your expectations were on the ward. A psych ward never fixes bpd. It can offer containment, and a safe place - but you left twice and then tried to bring unsafe items on the ward. You also suggest that you weren‚Äôt really engaging with the doctors.

Use this as a learning opportunity. Resources are out there for you to help yourself, but no one will be able to fix your condition for you, remember your behaviour is no one else‚Äôs responsibility but yours. I can see you are intelligence because you have shown the capacity to self reflect on what might have gone wrong in that admission. This insight will put you in good stead for the future. Sometimes it‚Äôs uncomfortable acknowledging our faults, but it will help you grow and learn :)

Abilify is an odd medication to recommend. It is an antipsychotic, but there is no solid evidence for bpd. Abilify for bpd is an off label use. Did they know initially your diagnosis was bpd? Or were you unknown to them when you first came in? Quetiapine is a better choice for bpd if you need a medication for symptomatic relief, and could be worth exploring with a general practitioner/primary care physician.",throw4w4y4y,False,1715897134.0
1ctk4ye,"Hi I never got a notification for your comment

and for clarification, technically I'm not diagnosed BPD (or EUPD in the UK) but I had expressed my suspicions and symptoms to the crisis team (who work directly with the ward doctors so whether they informed the doctors of the possible BPD, I have no idea, I'd assume so based on them discharging me). in the past I had just been diagnosed with seasonal depression and aspergers. and maybe unofficially a private hospital during my first section gave me schizoid personality disorder (before the ASD) but idk if the doctors agree with it. I do mask heavily though even in crisis.

>What were you expecting from them?

It's a good question. One I haven't been able to answer. So no to answer your other question, I didn't communicate my goals within the ward since I didn't particularly have any. I had been spiralling since January and felt community treatment wouldn't work and needed only admission which I waited moths for. I thought because admission solved my previous crisis years ago I figured it would solve my problems again but admittedly the circumstances are pretty different this time. Before, it was just seasonal depression and being suicidal. This time was more like moodswings, impulsive risky behaviour and dipping in and out of being suicidal.

During my time on the ward some of the nurses just told me they were flat out confused by my actions because they were so contradictory, because I wanted to come to the ward since I was voluntary and yet I spent my whole time there trying to leave and hurting myself. Idk. in a very crazy way I wanted them to section me. (involuntary) but they want to push for community treatment which I feel extremely reluctant about. I guess that's the avoidant part of me speaking.

About what you said re meds, the crisis doctor 2 months ago offered quetiapine but I only took it once and got concerning sharp chest pain (anxiety?) so I stopped taking it. But yeah I'm aware of the pattern that I seem to make my recovery almost impossible because I didn't engage on the ward and don't engage with taking my medication consistently. I hate it.

You may very well have depression and aspbergers as well as bpd, I can‚Äôt diagnose you but your behaviours sound very typical for someone with bpd admitted to an inpatient ward.¬†

Sometimes we want social interaction and attachment and seeking an admission and absconding are ways of seeking engagement. I‚Äôve known patients who didn‚Äôt know how to express their need for social connection in a healthy way, and did dramatic things on the ward instead. Be careful to follow the rules of the ward, because you could end up with a note in your history that says admissions are not helpful for you. Then one day when an admission might be warranted (eg for containment), you might sadly find yourself denied that opportunity based on past behaviours. I‚Äôve seen it happen so much.

1ctk4ye,">Do you have any idea why you‚Äôre afraid of getting better? Recovery is wonderful

I have lived the way I live for so long and I'm familiar with that and the unknown scares me? maybe its as simple as that. It sounds like a very weak excuse in my opinion. I've been telling myself for over a decade that I am not a normal human being, that what is the point of trying to have a normal life when I don't have any friends or desire to half the time. I can't have relationships since they always become dysfunctional. Even the only therapist I saw 2020 abandoned me. I don't even talk to the family I live with. I just feel spectacularly broken as a human being and I don't even know if its this schizoid thing, a borderline thing, aspergers or just all of it and I never got support for the last thing since they said I was ""too complex"". Since this november I haven't verbally said one word to family and the crisis team were the only ones I talked to for the last 4 months but they discharged me onto the community team after I left the ward 3 days ago so I feel like I'm back to being alone. and that's just it. I feel so alone. Not even technically lonely. I just feel so chronically alone and empty.

Just to add a bit of background...

I've isolated since I was barely 13 (now 29 so 16 years). Like stopped going to school. Didn't leave the house once for 6 years until I had a mental breakdown and got sectioned at 19, and then got sectioned like 5 more times once a year with seasonal depression and finally I stopped being suicidal at 24 but this year a loss triggered me and I guess I regressed to previous behaviours and since I developed a sense of safety in hospital from my sections I wanted to recreate those circumstances. Which is why I was also so adamant to the crisis team saying I only wanted to be in hospital. 

But I had a small realization after leaving the ward, that me wanting to be sectioned (having my freedom taken away from me and being taken care of) and also since I got in trouble with year with police going to the bridge a lot and still have to go to court I've been contemplating just intentionally trying to get sent to prison and again I think it revolves back around to going back to what I'm familiar with -- being locked up not having to make choices. I keep getting urges to hurt myself, partially because I don't want to be here but also just because I want to send myself back to hospital.",erraticplaything,True,1716065240.0

There's not much you can do other than being mindful of the things you have. You've got to change your outlook. Shit sucks, but it can be a lot worse. 

  
Im sorry I am not more helpful. This is what the AI said: 

1. **Acknowledge Your Emotions**: It's important to recognize and accept your feelings of anger and despair. Allow yourself to feel these emotions without judgment. Sometimes, just acknowledging that you're feeling upset can be a first step toward dealing with those feelings.
2. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a friend going through a tough time. Remember that it's okay to feel this way and that you're not alone.
3. **Focus on What You Can Control**: Identify the aspects of your life that you can influence and take action in those areas. It might be helpful to make a list of things you can control and those you can't, and then focus your energy on the former.
4. **Find Healthy Outlets for Your Emotions**: Engage in activities that help you release pent-up emotions in a healthy way. This could be exercise, creative pursuits, journaling, or talking to a trusted friend or therapist.
5. **Develop Coping Mechanisms**: Learn and practice coping strategies such as mindfulness, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. These can help you stay grounded and reduce feelings of anxiety and despair.
6. **Seek Support**: Reach out to friends, family, or a mental health professional. Talking about your feelings with someone who understands can provide relief and perspective.
7. **Set Small Goals**: Accomplishing small, achievable goals can help you regain a sense of control and accomplishment. It can be anything from organizing a space in your home to learning a new skill.
8. **Practice Gratitude**: Focusing on what you are grateful for can shift your perspective and help you see the positive aspects of your life, even during difficult times.
9. **Accept Imperfection**: Understand that life is inherently unpredictable and imperfect. Accepting this reality can help you become more resilient and less affected by the unfairness you encounter.
10. **Consider Professional Help**: If your feelings of anger and despair are overwhelming and persistent, consider seeking help from a therapist or counselor. They can provide tools and strategies tailored to your specific needs.",Atotallyrandomname,False,1715893939.0

1cte79s,"I still have these thoughts every day, but they are WAY LESS damaging than what they used to be after DBT+healing and time.

I usually try to combat it by thinking of the ‚ÄúIs it rational/Is it helpful‚Äù mindset, where for example if I feel like everyone at the grocery store hates me I try to think;

‚ÄúWhy would they hate me? Have they done anything that makes me FEEL like they hate me? Have I done something worthy of that reaction?‚Äù etc and usually I can brush it off by always arriving to the same conclusion which is that since they don‚Äôt know me, they don‚Äôt care enough about me in order to hate me. I think that makes sense?? I think of it in an uplifting way though, and not in a lonely or sad ‚ÄúNo one cares about me‚Äù way, which feels important to note.

1cte79s,"On the whole, I'm going to say yes. However, I do still have times where I feel this but it is more fleeting and I use some skills to get out of it. I can't speak to PMDD as I am a male, but I really feel for y'all as I cannot imagine another level of complexity affecting my mood along with having BPD. 

Largely, we as BPD havers feel things way more than others so any situation that is a minor inconvenience for someone else we perceive as a major event. (I'm sure you know these things and I'm not acting like you don't or trying to talk down to you, I'm just explaining where I'm coming from and how I got over it üòä) I had got into a habit of writing down every time I would catastrophize an event, as painful as that was, and revisit it. 9/10 I realized it was me hating me and not everyone hating me. I was hating my actions, or how I felt in the situation, or even how I was treated and how I internalized that. It was me that hated me, when truthfully, and for better or worse, no one was thinking about the situation that I was thinking about them hating me in. I hope some of that made sense.

I'm not sure if you are familiar with DBT, but some skills that I use (and that you don't necessarily need to take DBT to utilize) to work on this are:

Wise Mind, Describe (What skills in particular), Check the Facts, Self-soothe.

These really helped me focus on my emotions, calm down, and take some inventory of the situation. This didn't happen over night and I still get caught up thinking that my best friend hates me because he's busy with work, or my sister is mad because she doesn't want to hang out even though she has 2 small kids, I think my case manager doesn't give a shit about me because she didn't get something done as quickly enough as I'd like. 

A year ago these things would have ruined my day or my week. Now I'm worked up for like 5 minutes, I take a step back, use these skills, rationalize that people have other responsibilities and that doesn't mean they hate me, and then I go on about my day.

It's not perfect and I still slip up, but it's much better than it was. The best part though is when you begin to realize how much MORE energy it is to stay in the state of paranoia of thinking everyone hates you and you're just drained all the time. It's such an energy vampire and it's so much less energy to deal with it in a healthy way.

I hope this helped in some way and I hope you can take something from it and use it for yourself. If not that is okay too, we're all different.

I think you have to ask yourself some questions/consider the following ideas in order to have this whole thing more organized in your head:

1. Think about the reasons why neither of you have been happy. Are these issues solvable, or are they fundamental incompatibilities?

2. Consider what has changed over the years. What worked well in the past, and why isn't it working now?

3. Have an open and honest conversation with your SO about how you're feeling. Share your fears, concerns, and thoughts about the future. I would definitely take a sedative before this (valerian works for me very well).

4. Discuss whether both of you are willing to work on the relationship (e.g., couples therapy -> if this is too expensive in the US, where I'm guessing you are, perhaps you could try an overseas option, like online couples therapy from a cheaper European country with an English-speaking psychotherapist) and what changes would need to happen for you both to be happy. 

5. Seek support from friends, even if you don't really feel like talking to them about what's going on with you and your SO. Just to relax for at least a few minutes/hours. Maybe try to reconnect with some old friends?

6. Consider talking to a therapist (money is the issue? vide: point 4 above -> you could get top notch therapy for 30usd in Poland, English-speaking psychotherapist, online).

7. Try to do some things that will help you relax and manage your anxiety/stress + maybe meditation/mindfulness/prayer...? 

8. Assess your financial situation and create a budget. 

9. The cat: Talk to your SO about your concerns - perhaps you could share custody of the cat. 

10. Use this time to focus on your personal development. What are your goals, dreams, and aspirations outside of the relationship? My life has been much fuller since my ex and I broke up (4 years together) and I'm much happier now...

1ctbma2,"first of all, i'm really glad you're still here. i was in a similar situation a few years ago. everyone just thought i'd had too much to drink and blacked out. i didn't tell them the truth for over a month. the conversations were all difficult and painful, but they let me start healing from the experience.

it sounds like your partner is a safe person to share things with and like he really cares about you... which means he will be upset. not at you, but for you. sad that you were in so much pain that you made an attempt, worried about your physical and mental wellbeing in the aftermath, maybe even angry at himself for not knowing or stopping it somehow. as hard as it can be to feel like you've hurt your partner, try to remember that they're hurting because they care about you - not because you've done something wrong.

i was terrified of hurting my partner when i first started dating them and everytime i did, i beat myself up about it for days on end. we had a conversation at one point where they told me that hurting people you care about is inevitable. what matters is how you repair the harm and move forward. there's nothing you can do to lessen the impact or distress telling him this will cause, but trusting him with this is the first step to healing the pain together.

it's agonizing to keep an experience like this secret, and you've been doing it for nearly two months now. telling people what happened was the only way i was able to let go of that pain and start healing. you deserve to put this weight down and rebuild, and to be supported by someone who cares about you while you're doing that work. this is a terrifying conversation, but it's a necessary one. you only have to be brave for long enough to say what happened - it gets so much easier once you get that out. i believe in you and wish you luck :-)",opabiniasupremacy,False,1715876925.0
1ctbma2,"Hey! I‚Äôve gone through something very similar with my partner, so I‚Äôll offer a bit of advice from my perspective. 

First and foremost, I think your partner will be understanding and willing to listen regardless of the severity of the situation. If they‚Äôve been patient in the past they will be patient now because they love you unconditionally. They are there for you on your good days and your bad ones, and if they are as supportive as they sound I know they‚Äôd be just as kind and patient with you if you told them this. 

Secondly, I think the more you wait to tell them the more difficult it will be just for your own mental sake. I hear you and understand completely how it feels to have something like that happen, it feels like a secret you have to keep and no one will understand. But I promise you that‚Äôs not true, and there‚Äôs people who understand and care deeply about you. Your partner cares about you and I think they would really appreciate you opening up about this. They will understand that this is difficult for you, and they will understand why you didn‚Äôt tell them immediately. Explain to them your feelings surrounding what happened, and your feelings afterwards. They will appreciate you being honest and open with them and you‚Äôll feel a huge weigh being lifted by having your feelings heard. 

BPD is something I‚Äôm learning to navigate through as well with my partner, and one of the best things we‚Äôve found is to be just plain honest with feelings. If I‚Äôm feeling anxious for no good reason, I tell my partner and we talk about how it‚Äôs ok have these feelings even if they have no ‚Äútrue‚Äù reason to exist right now.

- Significantly reduced expenses. No forking out money for gas, car maintenance, public transport fares, meals from eating out, or needing office clothes and shoes.

1ctbb3d,"You're right. Finding a well-paying WFH job can definitely be challenging. The competition is often intense due to the high demand, and it can sometimes be hard to distinguish legitimate opportunities from scams.

I first saw my job advertised through LinkedIn and it took me about four applications before I was finally given an interview. I had to go through a digital literacy screening test and two interviews before being given a job offer ‚Äî but it can be done. 

Look for job listings in LinkedIn and Indeed. If you're in Australia, include Seek Australia and Jora Jobs. Use the filter to search for remote opportunities. 

Also consider developing your skills and planning your career for fields that usually have WFH jobs.

- Digital marketing is pretty good. One of my friends is a social media manager for an artist from Laguna Beach. She has a Bachelor's Degree in Communications. The entire marketing team from the company I work at is WFH. They have an opening right now for a Brand Manager. 

- Coding is also an option. I had a patient yesterday who's a software developer. The entire IT Team from the clinic I work at is WFH. 

- There's graphic design. Tbh, this field is even more highly competitive than others. (I am learning graphic design as a hobby.) AI art also has made this job even more highly competitive. 

- Data analysis also usually has remote work opportunities. Full time positions usually involve tracking performance metrics, analyzing customer behavior, and optimizing business processes. You can find these jobs in tech, finance, health care, and e-commerce. 

Persistence, continuous improvement, and adjusting your expectations are key. How important is it that the well paying job you're looking for is easy to find? If you do find such a position, consider what downsides come with it being easy.",ladyhaly,False,1715893925.0

You got a ton of comments here because this is a very emotionally intense situation to be in, so you've been through a lot, and many people are able to see that and relate. We can talk about hormones, we can sympathize with you, validate your feelings, all these things, and while many of the facts surrounding those comments are true and well intentioned and may result in you feeling better, none of that is actually going to address the heart of the problem.

That's the motivation behind all your worries, guilt, other negative emotions. Personally I think you did the most motherly thing you could have done in your situation, but hearing that from strangers isn't truly a solution to things. The sense of a *need* to hear that in order to feel okay, the fear of the potential of that not being true, the finding yourself in abusive relationships due to self worth and doubt, because everything is such a struggle to untangle since it has not really been approachable due to fear(which no one who understood your life would ever blame you for)-- understanding those things with a kindness and honesty towards yourself is going to open the door to improving your life.

You already actually have plenty of understanding, you're able to admit you shut down, you're able to admit you would repeat the same things with children you have that your parents abused you with. That is amazing progress and intelligence and awareness, so just keep cultivating those positive qualities. One of the best things people with bad parents can do is reverse engineer bad parenting. That doesn't mean do the opposite(for instance, if one received no love, they may sometimes smother with love, or vice versa), but it just means figure out the wise and skillful way to be by looking at how not to be.",Compassionate_Cat,False,1715960531.0

My (very religious) mother called to tell me I was killing her first grandchild and that I would be a murderer in the eyes of God if I went through with it. That destroyed me to some degree, but mainly it destroyed my relationship with her. I got the abortion. I do not regret it. 

I was not ready. I was young, with a guy that wasn‚Äôt right, and my head was a MESS. I hadn‚Äôt had any therapy yet. I had substance abuse issues. Sometimes I think ‚Äúholy shit id have a [insert age] year old now!‚Äù Sometimes it makes me a little sad, but I still don‚Äôt regret for that decision. 

Why? Abuse. The abuse that gave me my mental state. The abuse that led me to be with that guy instead of someone worthy. The abuse that my mom rains down on me. The abuse that my dad has handed out. The abuse that I was doing to myself both knowingly and unknowingly. The generational abuse that I would have funneled straight into that kid. And worse, the trauma that I still had coming my way in the years past that (cancer, school shooting, SA, death). 

I did what was not only best for me, but best for my child. I do wonder if they might have curly hair sometimes. I do think they were a whole person with a soul. But that doesn‚Äôt matter. Honestly, if cancer or a gunshot might be the end of this kid before they reach 20, how bad is what I did? I don‚Äôt really see it as bad.

1cta3mr,"I think it's commendable that you've been maintaining such positive habits and staying on top of things, especially considering the challenges that come with BPD. It's also natural to feel demotivated and overwhelmed when your physical health takes a hit.

First, if you haven't already, please see a GP or go to urgent care to treat the UTI. Physical ailments can profoundly affect your mental state, and addressing them can help you start feeling better overall.

Regarding your loss of motivation ‚Äî it's important to recognize that recovery and maintaining mental health is often non-linear. There are ups and downs, and a down period doesn‚Äôt erase the progress you‚Äôve made. Alleviate some of the pressure to always feel motivated or productive. You are human, not a machine. 

To regain your motivation, consider breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. Celebrate the small victories ‚Äî like getting out of bed or taking care of your hygiene. These are significant on the tough days. It's okay to hang on and slow down. 

Reconnect with your reasons for staying on top of these habits in the first place. Was it because it made you feel better about yourself? Helped you stay organized? Reflect on these reasons and try to visualize the positive outcomes that come from maintaining your routines.

I also highly recommend a therapist who can provide support and accountability. Sometimes, just talking about how you‚Äôre feeling can lighten your emotional load.

Lastly, be kind to yourself. You‚Äôre dealing with a lot, and it‚Äôs okay to have moments where things aren‚Äôt perfect. Focus on what you can manage right now and allow yourself time to recover from your illness. You've shown great strength already, and with time and self-compassion, you will likely find your footing again.",ladyhaly,False,1715858752.0

1cta3mr,"I'm going through the same thing. I was doing really well and working out every day and lifting weights,  then I got covid and my ex is trying to get my kids 50 percent of the time when he was np where to he found for the last 10 years I raised them on my own.

It's been really hard and I'm having a hard time no getting suicidal:/",6995luv,False,1715877236.0
1cta3mr,"I'm pretty good at building and keeping habits despite my mental health issues. I find routine to be key for everyday hygiene things. You have to train your body/mind so that you wake up then you for example brush your teeth. I'd say start with one habit when you first wake up (like brush your teeth when you first wake up) then once that's established you can habit stack. This means you stack one habit after another, for instance washing your face after brushing your teeth. Then you eventually create a chain of habits.

  
To keep myself motivated and reward myself with dopamine I use a habit-tracking app to track my habits while I'm building them. It sounds silly but I like seeing how many days/weeks I've one something. Numbers are tangible but you can use a paper habit tracker and star stickers or something else that will work for you. It may take some experimenting but finding what works for you is key. You can even plan to get yourself a treat/reward after doing a habit for a month or something. 

  
Also, try to remember what it feels like after you do these habits compared to if you don't. For example, I always try to remember what it will feel like after I've gone off a run because that's the reason to do it. 

  
To do something that may take some time, set a timer for 1 minute (or 5 again whatever works for you) and tell yourself you'll just do it till the time goes off. Often you'll find once you've started you continue even if the timer goes off. This method also makes tasks smaller and less overwhelming. 

  
Making tasks less overwhelming is also key. So break tasks down to smaller bits to avoid overwhelm. 

  
However, considering you have a UTI at the moment I will say I always allow myself to rest when I'm sick. I watched my Mum work herself to near death and be no better for it so if I'm sick I do the bare minimum, rest and take medication/natural remedies. If you're sick you're sick. I do always brush my teeth, wash my face and keep my space neat but that's just me, I don't find these things too hard but if they are for you, use mouthwash instead of brushing your teeth, splash your face with water or use some micellar water of a cotton round instead of doing a whole skincare routine etc. Find easier versions of what you want to be your non-negotiables.

  
Finally, if you want to do things at a certain time, like start your evening routine at 8:30pm, set an alarm. I like using  alarms.

1ct9yy0,"I think it's important to recognize that BPD, like many mental health conditions, can present very differently in different people. Not everyone with BPD experiences every symptom, and the intensity of symptoms can vary widely. The absence of a specific symptom (like feelings of emptiness) doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean your diagnosis is incorrect.

However, it‚Äôs also wise to consider that mental health diagnoses can be complex, and sometimes initial diagnoses are revised as more information becomes available or as symptoms evolve.

To address your concerns about the accuracy of your diagnosis, the best step would be to seek a second opinion. Consult another mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, who can review your symptoms, perform a comprehensive evaluation, and give their professional opinion. It‚Äôs okay to share your doubts and concerns with them. Actually, it's very important to do so.

Regarding ensuring that this kind of potential misdiagnosis doesn‚Äôt happen again, one key approach is to maintain ongoing and open communication with your healthcare providers. Keep a journal of your symptoms, feelings, and any episodes that seem significant. This can provide them with detailed information that can aid in accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.

Dealing with a complex diagnosis while living in an unsupportive or abusive environment is incredibly challenging. Therefore please remember ‚Äî it's okay to seek multiple sources of help, and it‚Äôs important to prioritize your well-being.",ladyhaly,False,1715860959.0

1ct35v6,"It's mainly a habit I formed as a result of co-morbid OCD. But it's also a form of self-harm. I have an irrational fear that if I don't read the comments I'm just creating an echo chamber. I know that's not necessarily true. But I've noticed that people who play armchair psychologist tend to lock themselves in echo chambers & refuse to listen to mental health professionals. And I guess I have a fear that I'm somehow just as bad as them if I don't read hate comments. I know it doesn't entirely make sense, but OCD isn't rational.

Though, sometimes, even when I'm not seeking it out or actively trying to avoid hate comments, I still come across them anyway. Heck, recently after I posted this, someone left a hate comment ranting about how they think people with BPD are all evil & insisting that the stigma ""wasn't stigma"" & was justified. (Though, thankfully, it looks like the mods removed it after I reported it.)

They also went on a semi-rant about how great  & benevolent they think Neurotypical people & how ""Neurotypical people would never dream of splitting back or being mean to their partner-"" Which is just complete bullshit. Anyone of any neurotype or diagnosis can be an asshole, & splitting doesn't just happen in people with BPD. Armchair psychologists tend to think in black & white terms. And in the same way that person may have trauma from a person with BPD; I also have trauma from my neurotypical parents & societal ableism. Any neurodivergent person can tell you that Neurotypicals as just as capable of being assholes as everyone else. And the idea that Neurotypical automatically equals morally superior is inherently ableist.

And when I was browsing shorts on a BPD recovery channel on YouTube, I found this one person who was engaging with the channel just to leave hate comments. They left a total of 13 recent comments on the channel. Unfortunately, it wasn't just someone who happened to come across something that triggered them. This was a case of targeted harassment.

Sorry if I went on a bit of a tangent there. It's just really frustrating & discouraging seeing stigma everywhere, even in spaces that are supposed to be supportive, since armchair psychologists seem to love invading them. At this point, I just want armchair psychologists to leave people the heck alone. But their self-righteousness.& insistence on treating the world as black & white always seems to speak the loudest.

I have seen one of those group sessions. It was a nightmare because it's like 8 people arguing with one therapist, and the pwBPD's collective  voice overpowers the therapist. They are helpful, but like you said, frustrating. 

There are different levels of therapy. Group therapy I more like an alcoholic anonymous meeting, psychologists don't know what they are doing as far as pwBpd. 

CLINICAL phycologist's, emphasis on ""clinical"" can talk to your specific concerns and challenge your negative self-talk patterns. 

It's like, ""Oh my God, I never looked at it that way, wow, geez. Hmm.""

A bit of tough love in there, but they are doing that for you, not because they are nasty. They just need you to understand your own role in your troubles. But any confrontational interactions with them are eased almost instantly when you realise a massive weight has been lifted off your shoulder, that you were carrying unnecessarily. 

Give that a go. Group therapy is an echo chamber, more about venting. 

Goid luck, I wish you all the best in this. 

Remember, you CAN be healed. such as depression, drug abuse, severe anxiety disorders, the issue at the core of BPD is the addiction of falling in love with indulging and hugging your sadness.

1cszopw,"Hi! Here to let you know that the emptiness and never satisfied, something‚Äôs missing feeling comes from a place of not having a good relationship with yourself. You‚Äôre searching for validation and love and a person with a more healthy internal monologue is able to provide those things for themselves so that when it comes to outward validation they don‚Äôt need as much. Whereas we need all of our validation to come from others and others aren‚Äôt able to fully fulfill that need so we always feel like something is lacking.

One of the first steps to addressing this issue is learning to speak nicely to yourself in your head. If you struggle with this two strategies I use are first just turning my negative thoughts to neutral thoughts then when that is easier trying to change them to positive (ie negative ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bad person‚Äù, neutral ‚ÄúI am a person who has done both bad and good things‚Äù, positive ‚ÄúI am a good person even if I have done some bad things‚Äù). Or another strategy I use is pretending I am talking to one of my younger siblings because I love them and think they are amazing and deserve the very best but I struggled to feel the same way about myself. This could also work pretending to talk to a dear friend. Imagine they are coming to you telling you they are feeling the same thoughts and feelings you are having about yourself and how you would support them and show them love and try to change their outlook.

Once you learn to validate, love and support yourself your need for those things from outside sources will become so much less and more easy to meet. The emotional burden placed on others will be decreased which will positively benefit all your relationships!",CorgiPuppyParent,False,1715828828.0

The symptoms aren‚Äôt effecting my life anymore. For example, my husband came home today and was in a bad mood (to be fair it was a really bad day for him at work today), I tried to ask him about his day and some other things to try to strike up conversation but he just responded with one word answers and wouldn‚Äôt even look up from what he was doing. In the past this would make me feel so devastated and hurt like he didn‚Äôt love me anymore and I‚Äôd be so overwhelmed by my own emotions I‚Äôd end up lashing out. But instead today I recognized it was a bad day for him. I was able to focus on what he needed and quell that small fear that rose up. I gave him a big hug and told him I loved him and gave him some space to unwind. By the time I came back I was totally calm and so was he and we sat down to watch something and cuddle.¬†

My emotions aren‚Äôt so overwhelming anymore and I know how to cope if they do get overwhelming. I feel confident in my ability to handle myself and my relationships with others. As far as leading a fulfilling life absolutely. I‚Äôve been married for 5 years and since reaching remission my relationship is the healthiest it‚Äôs ever been. I‚Äôm able to communicate effectively with my spouse and not lash out impulsively. My friendships are soo much better too.

Assuming everything you say is true and accurate and assuming your boyfriend is who he says he is, and you've given no reason to doubt either in this post, I think it's POSSIBLE he has been misdiagnosed. BPD almost always presents with some form of emotional disfunction, typically feeling heightened emotions. This often looks like mood swings but really isn't. Also, the fact that his personal relationships are stable and long-term is uncharacteristic. The last reason I'd suspect they got the diagnosis wrong is you mentioned he's very passionate about life, has a good career and hobbies, and what not. A lot of people with BPD have intense feelings of emptiness, like we are without an emotional core or true personality, which doesn't seem to line up with who your boyfriend is based on this post. 

I don't want to create mistrust between your boyfriend and his doctors, but something isn't adding up. It sounds like the majority of his problems are under control and stable, if he does have BPD he's done a great job of dealing with it.",Responsible_Bonus766,False,1715832762.0
1csxkls,"Thank you for your response. He voiced the same things you are saying, but I was a little concerned it was just denial. 

He does feel emptiness during before and after dissociating which makes social interactions hard for him. Often times he has trouble interacting with people the day after an episode as they feel 'like aliens.' Outside of this he does seem to have a strong sense of self though, which is in alignment with what you were staying. 

This is actually the second time he has been diagnosed with bpd. I don't really know the specifics but I know when he was in high school psychiatrists thought he had bipolar and bpd at various points. I think this is part of the reason he is resistant to treatment, like they just keep throwing words at him. He also used to have more issues with emotional regulation (again I don't really know specifics but he has mentioned it), but he seems to have sorted that. Though it seems kind of crazy to think he figured out how to deal with the heightened emotions/emptiness you described on his own as a teenager. But I am fully just speculating at this point.",Kindly-Daikon7637,True,1715834016.0
1csxkls,"The emptiness is typically persistent. If he's only experiencing it immediately before and after a disassociative episode, I don't think that's a clue, just a part of the episode. Same with his resistance to treatments because if he IS somebody with BPD or any of the cluster B disorders, then it's entirely possible he's just resistant to treatment. Cluster B disorders are very hit or miss. We don't understand how they work or what causes them very well at all, let alone how to treat them effectively. But it'd also make sense if he's being misdiagnosed that treatment wouldn't be working. So, there's not much of a clue there either, unfortunately. 

The fact he's been diagnosed with BPD twice is very odd, it's often misdiagnosed, but still, to have the same mistake happen twice seems unlikely. I feel like at this point we are missing information, either from your boyfriend of from the doctors, but it's not my place to pry. I hope everything goes well for you and your boyfriend, but it sounds like you'd need to talk to his doctors and find out more completly their reason for sticking to this diagnosis so firmly, assuming of course there is reason to press the issue. If he is making progress on his issues and is otherwise happy and going in a good direction, I'd let it be.

Your feelings of detachment and then intense caring are not uncommon and don't make you a terrible partner. Please read that last sentence again. I really need you to know that. 

Taking a break can indeed be healthy. It allows you space to explore your feelings and needs without the pressure of maintaining daily relationship routines. During this time, focus on self-reflection and understanding your own patterns in relationships. I found therapy incredibly helpful in this regard, particularly DBT and Schema Therapy together. (Start with understanding Attachment Theory by John Bowlby.) 

Communicate openly with your partner about your struggles. It's vital for her to understand that your fluctuating feelings aren't a reflection of her worth or desirability, but rather part of a disorder you are continuously learning to manage.

Finally, try to engage in self-care practices that enhance your mental stability and overall well-being. Regular exercise, enough sleep, and mindfulness can all contribute to a more balanced mental state.

It lead someone else to be able to abuse me, cause i couldnt trust my gut and instinct that what she was doing was abusive and that she was a bad person. I was once again just over reacting to her constantly cause of my bpd......

Two things can be true at once. It can be all the bad things you said, but it can also serve as a jumping off point for people. Part of many recovery groups is often seeing people who are worse off you are, not taking accountability and you seeing enough in yourself or where you once were before you started your own recovery that it motivates you to keep pushing forward with what is doing good for you so you don't fall back on the old habits.

That's why every AA meeting has really old people who haven't drank in 50 years but still call themselves an alcoholic. They show up to see young people who are making the same mistakes and can't admit it. Seeing that helps them stay sober.

From what I hear from -even Dr Fox which is often posted on this subreddit, we're not supposed to blame this stuff on BPD. It can be a reason or something to explain the behavior, but from what I've learned we all seem to make choices. We make bad choices often because we're often putting mental states of distress.¬†


I don't know why it's toxic to bring it up according to some of the comments here. I've had to report certain posts because they would say that BPD ""made me do this"". Maladaptive behaviors are still choices to be made. One of the biggest things people with BPD have to work on is often learning the more healthy behaviors.¬†

1csq8k3,"In 10 days I will be 51(m) years old.   The first day of 2024 kicked-off the worst year I've had in a very long time.  I've lost lifelong friends this year, my quiet BPD became rageful and loud, and my cluster (suic*de) headaches have returned after 3 blissful years without them.

However, the time between age 39-50 were the best 11 years of my life.

I have to choose my words carefully here because (as I have learned) my post will be deleted/removed if I recommend what appears to have facilitated those years of peace, happiness and contentment.

So, to be very clear...  I AM NOT RECOMMENDING ANYTHING IN THIS POST!    I am simply relating/expressing/communicating an experience that I had.

BPD ran rampant and undiagnosed in my life until age 30.   When I was 30, I became so insufferable to those around me, it was clear that something was terribly wrong with how I was acting, reacting and coping with my emotions and interpersonal relationships.

That's when I sought counseling/therapy and was finally diagnosed.   It was 2003 and although I finally had a name for the disorder that was making life so unbearable for me and everyone around me, I wasn't given much information about what BPD really was or what I could do to help myself.  

I was told about DBT group therapy, but back then Borderline Personality Disorder was mostly regarded as a ""female"" diagnosis and the only DBT group in my area was strictly ""women only"".   

From my perspective, the easiest way to deal with my new diagnosis was to slowly begin to isolate myself until there was no one left to hurt or affect in a negative way.

Learning to be a reclusive person was the only realistic option I could take, aside from ending myself completely, which has always been a very real ""plan B"" for me.

When I turned 38, I had just survived final stage cancer, but I was still very much addicted to pain meds, which had been an ongoing reality for me for over 20 years. 

Getting cancer just gave me an excuse to take even bigger doses without feeling guilty or ashamed about it.

After getting a second chance at life, I didn't want to walk around drugged-out, half-asleep and sedated anymore, so I forced myself to slowly ween off of those drugs.  Which I did... but I was miserable and constantly in a state of craving, uncomfort and uneasy anxiety.   ...and to add insult to injury, my Cluster Headaches came back stronger than they had ever been.   

 It was such a shame to me, but with those miserable headaches on top of everything else, I began to prepare myself for ""Plan B"".

I had read online that a lot of people had success in stopping their cluster headache cycle by ingesting a certain type of fungi.   In a last-ditch attempt to stop my clusters, I found some of these particular fungi and digested them.  

I was very desperate, and in my desperation I had unknowingly taken a dose of them that was nearly 5 times larger than what was recommended.

My ONLY goal was to stop the cluster headaches.

The overdose resulted in me experiencing what psychedelic researchers call an ""ego-dissolving, belief-changing, mystical experience.""

For the sake of brevity, I will just say that it was the most terrifying, ecstatic, spiritually and emotionally wound-healing experience I have ever had.

After that experience, the Cluster headache cycle stopped, which was an incredible feat to me, but the most unexpected thing that happened...

The real miracle to me was....

I suddenly noticed that my constant cravings to go back to using pain-meds was just...  GONE.

My overwhelming uneasiness and constant ""on-edge"" anxiety was GONE.

My lifelong depression, feelings of separateness and disconnection to the world around me, was GONE.

My deep-seeded fear of abandonment...  was just GONE.

Over time, I learned that this wonderful ""break"" from all of these symptoms was a temporary thing...  and would require a great deal of self-work, patience and introspection if I wanted to extend the duration of their absence.   But most importantly, I learned what life could feel like without them.   

..and that is something I couldn't even fathom before.

To reiterate my previous statement, I AM NOT RECOMMENDING THAT ANYONE HERE TAKES OR INGESTS ANYTHING!

But please, take the time to do your own research and consider every risk, reward and/or possibility before you decide that ""Plan B"" is your only remaining option.  

My heart goes out to you, OP.

My heart goes out to each and every person here with BPD and to the people who care about you that are affected by the challenges/repercussions/destructive behaviors/symptoms that arise from BPD.

1csq8k3,"Im 36, it absolutely gets better when you accept responsibility for the behaviors you've learned fron the traumas you unfairly endured. It's not right that anyone had to go through the things they did that usually causes the development of disorders like BPD or cPTSD, but it doesn't excuse the fact that we are the only ones responsible for the symptoms and behaviors that affects our wellbeing and the people around us. No one else is going to be able to lift the burden off your shoulders but yourself and no one else should be made to. And treatment, that is effective, should be one of the biggest challenges and most uncomfortable things to go through in your life. Because you need to sit with, look at, accept, and challenge all the worst parts of yourself that you never challenged before and you need to hold and process emotions you never allowed your body to feel before that are weighing you down and waiting to be released and clouding your judgement without you ever realizing it. And you need to repeat these processes over and over and over again until they're the natural responses instead of flying off the emotional spectrum at the softest touch.

I fucked around for 10 years doing DBT and learning how to visually reduce BPD symptoms but something was always missing and it was the aa ability to stop the avoidant behaviors and ruminating on my traumas and instead sit with them and be challenged and process the heavy emotions. When i started doing that, practicing a philosophy of living by my virtues, and also worked on my lingering codependent behaviors it all came together and any residual suffering, emptiness, or identity crises that go along with BPD disappeared.

Everyone has their own healing journey and no two are alike and this was just mine. I do know statistically that when people enter the recommended treatment guidelines there's over a 50% remission rate just within the first 24 months.

The more you realise that YOU are in control of what comes out of your mouth and how you behave, the easier things get. I know some things \*feel\* automatic, but they're not really. Something I learned was to hold my breath when something awful wanted to come out of my mouth...I learned that if I can create a big enough gap between feeling and doing then I could make changes to my behaviour. Practice the skills when things are easy so you have them when things are hard. There's a lot of brain science that's gone into DBT, for example, and we've been able to see how and why it works.

I also have done a lot (a loooooot) of therapy; DBT (twice), Schema therapy, and a shit tonne of individual therapy with a skills-based, solutions-focused therapist. Talk therapist has its place but not here.

You can have whatever life you feel you deserve and that you make for yourself. I live on a disability pension at the moment and live a very small, very quiet life...but I'm genuinely content. I can save a little bit of money, I can pay my bills, keep my shit together, and buy a little thing for myself now and again. Part of what helped lead me to contentment was practicing (genuinely practicing, actively doing) gratitude...For instance, I'm tired, I feel like I'm not where I should be...but I have everything I need. All my needs are met. I'm sitting outside feeding local birds by hand, I'm walking with my dog and improving her behaviour, really connecting with her, I'm engaged with my family and blessed to have their love and support. Those blessings make the hard things easier to bear.

Remember that life isn't a race or a competition. It's your life, you are welcome to live it as you please. A great therapist once told me that if things aren't going the way I want them to, if I'm not happy with how things are, all I need ever do is make a different choice and choose it wholly.

It is possible to get better. This illness truly sucks, but it doesn't have to destroy your life. Therapy was life changing for me. I went from about 3 years ago threatening to kill both myself and my then partner while driving, if he didn't get out of the car (yeah, that was messed up, definitely not my proudest moment), to a place where I'm honestly not sure if I'd meet the criteria for BPD if I got assessed today. 

It's taken time and a lot of hard work, but I can honestly say I'm actually kinda happy to be alive and even a little excited about the future. 

I know you said you can't afford to find a better therapist right now. I'm so sorry about that. In the meantime, let me share what has helped me the most. As cheesy as it sounds, just being a lot kinder to myself has probably been the biggest factor in feeling better.

You know those negative thought spirals of, ""I didn't clean up my room today, im so lazy, I'm never gonna be able to do anything, I should just kill myself""? Turns out those kinda thoughts are really exhausting to deal with all day. That might be why I didn't clean my room, I was too tired from fighting a war in my head.

Instead, just reminding myself that ""I'm doing the best that I can"" was kinda revolutionary. It's hard, and it takes time to rewire your thoughts, but practising just a little self-acceptance really goes a long way.

Some people get better, and I'm beyond happy to hear those stories. I am not optimistic about where I'll be by 40, but I allow myself (and sometimes force myself) to hope that maybe one day things will get better.

The biggest thing is communication. Communicate what triggers you, communicate what you‚Äôre feeling, communicate what you‚Äôre thinking, communicate when you‚Äôre having a hard time.

I keep a lot to just me and my therapist and communicate to him the important things he needs to know and things like the revelations I‚Äôve had in therapy.

Also listen. Practice active listening: when they are telling you something important you pay attention, when they are done speaking summarize back to them to what they‚Äôve told you to confirm you heard/understood/interpreted correctly, give them space to confirm or explain further, once you get confirmation then respond.

You do your best to access resources and treatment now. It can start getting better now. I'm sorry you had to suffer that much longer than you needed.

1csnvbf,"You take care, too.

Here is my two cents for you - DBT is not going to fix the trauma or negligence that helped develop your BPD. Your BPD comes with a common collection of attitudes and behaviours that manifest as we get older and turn into all the **maladaptive** patterns and strategies we use to try and solve our invalidating triggers. DBT is going to be a **toolbox** that shows and teaches you all the **adaptive** skills and strategies we should be using daily, instead.

For example, through DBT I learned what envy and grief are. How and why I feel them, what their purpose is, and how to process those feelings accordingly. You're god damned right you could have saved yourself from trauma sooner, could have had that successful relationship too. I also slowly destroyed a relationship and left an ex-fiancee, too. You don't need to leave anything behind you only need to learn what it is, where it comes from and how to deal with it.

To be honest, while I wasn't perfect in any of those, most of them I still feel to this day that cutting off contact was the best choice. 

I was deeply hurt by most of those relationships and almost all of them wanted to be friends after, but for example, my boyfriend of four and a half years dumped me via text. I told him, while he was crying, that a friend wouldn't have done that to me. He hadn't been a friend to me and I would expect better from a friend than certain ways he'd treated me in the relationship, so he wasn't someone I wanted as a friend.

I got a lot of flack for that, because we live in a small community so most people play nice. I didn't antagonize him, I just made it very clear i wanted nothing to do with him and made good on that.

Zero regrets, I have had this experience with other people and it's been the best choice.   


If the person HAD handled things respectfully and was a friend to me in the relationship, maybe I would leave an opening. 

I did that with ONE person and he kept asking to sleep with me afterward, even though I told him how hurtful it was so I had to cut him off.

1csje8h,"Yes, I used to have a problem with that. It's better now that I'm a bit older (27), single, and have my life largely together (not many triggers). It's not fully gone though - especially when I'm feeling down.

It's the constant search for excitement from new connections, and possibly some other factors such as: FOMO, unmet emotional needs, low self-esteem (so you look for validation everywhere you go).

Another thing is fantasy v. reality. I think this is something many people struggle with - and not only the ones with BPD (perhaps we just take longer to realise what the problem here is). There may be a discrepancy between the fantasy of a perfect relationship that you imagine with new people and the reality of maintaining a healthy LTR which obviously is much more complex and hard to keep up than a fresh, exciting connection.

I can't give you a straightforward solution, but maybe taking care of the root of this problem (especially the FOMO, unmet emotional needs, low self-esteem) is what you need. That's what helped me :)

[Home]

You are walking along a path. You look around, noticing your surroundings. This path leads you to a house. Only you can see the house, really picture it in your mind's eye. You walk up to the house, and knock on the door. Your 10 year old self answers the door, and they are so *excited* to see you. They invite you in, and want to hear all about you, what you've been up to, how you're doing, what you've learned. They love you unconditionally, and are so proud of you for being you and living through what you have. Inside this house is every version of you that has existed, from newborn until now. You are home.

You can talk to any past version of yourself whenever you want, they live within you. Talk with them. Understand them. Learn from them. Love them, as they love you. Love yourself and be kind, give yourself grace and celebrate everything that makes you uniquely you. Your mind is your space, you carry home with you everywhere you go.

Now you might think another person can give you that safe and secure feeling (I made the same mistake), but they can't really, not without *your* help.

First off all I want to say that home isn‚Äôt something you have to look for, it‚Äôs already inside of you. I was diagnosed with BPD 6 months ago, at first I really struggled. I thought things like ‚Äúwhy am I like this‚Äù ‚ÄúI hate myself‚Äù ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I just be like x y z‚Äù ‚Äúwhy do I care so much‚Äù ‚Äúwhy do I suffer all the time‚Äù I had a friend give me my first book on Buddhism which was ‚Äúwhat the Buddha taught‚Äù it was A LOT. But just reading his teachings and trying to comprehend what the hell he meant by there is no self, and yadada. I started to feel a bit lighter. I then moved on to a book called fear by thich nhat hanh, this gave me insight into dealing with my fears, and being mindful of strong emotions that arise in me. I got the most straight forward formula for dealing with emotions. Thich loves to say Smile at it :). When I have an emotion like anger, or jealousy or worry or fear I look at this feeling within myself and I smile at it, then it loses some of its power. If we can be mindful of our emotions and embrace them with love and compassion they don‚Äôt have as much as a hold over us. When you come back to the present , and really connect your mind to your body by focusing on your breath you are home. You can even repeat . I am here, I am home. The past is just historical events and the future doesn‚Äôt exist yet. You have only right now and you can find happiness and your feeling of home in the present moment. Without sounding like a Mormon trying to throw my beliefs at you, I wanted to put this into your awareness, I really do believe it would help you as it has helped me tremendously in just a month or two. My triggers no longer cause any detrimental consequences in my life. Mostly just uncomfortable feelings that I can be mindful of and overcome now that I have the tools.

It's all about believing that you can get better and actually trying to do what you learn as much as possible. It worked for me, but it took time and a lot of work.

When I graduated high school, everyone else was hugging and taking pictures and saying tearful goodbyes, but I was all alone, feeling so empty that I wasn't even happy to have graduated.

I told my brother that he's the voice in my head that tells me to kill myself. I didn't value that relationship and I don't regret it, but I was definitely splitting. 

When I ran into my ex and I was dating someone new, I told the ex about some of the bad shit he did to me while we were dating and when he was really kind and apologetic about it, I told him I had cheated on my current partner because I knew that was unforgivable to him. It wasn't true. That ex was one of the few people in my life that ever had patience and understanding towards me and I've tried to undo it but I don't think I can. 

I've used people to prove a point. I've said so much nasty shit to people that I can see their heart break in front of me and in the moment I only feel satisfied and righteous. 

 I do a lot of bad shit but I rarely regret it. Most of my outbursts are pent up resentment from not setting boundaries or expressing my needs properly so when I start screaming or splitting, it's usually me finally asserting myself.

I also did a bunch of anger management courses cause some of the tecniques apply. 

mindfullness is the first step to success, what did can you notice happens before an episode that you can use as warning signs. what are you feeling, is it based in reality or could it be irrational. what the signs are that a thought could be irrational. techniques for grounding. meditation done to its truest extent. even what kind of self care you can do at the beginning to better manage, you could probably google almost all of these things. the self care especially. its better to try any reasonable self care you can find when you feel well to see what will work better when you do feel upset.

1csc5m6,"Dealing with intense and seemingly unwarranted anger sounds incredibly challenging, especially when it feels disproportionate to the situation at hand. It‚Äôs commendable that you‚Äôre seeking ways to understand and manage these feelings rather than letting them control your actions.

First, recognizing that your anger might be disproportionate is a significant first step in addressing it. This self-awareness allows you to start separating your feelings from your actions, which is key in managing intense emotions.

Second, consider blocking or limiting your exposure to triggers such as looking at social media posts from your FP. This isn‚Äôt about avoiding your problems, but rather about reducing unnecessary stress while you work on understanding and managing what's going on with your reactions.

Third, exploring the underlying reasons for your anger would probably be helpful. Sometimes, intense emotions like anger can stem from past hurts, fears, or frustrations that might not be immediately obvious. Therapy, particularly Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), which is commonly effective for BPD, can provide tools to help manage these emotional responses and develop a deeper understanding of your triggers.

Fourth, developing a routine for emotional regulation (e.g. mindfulness, meditation, regular exercise), can reduce overall stress levels and help in managing anger more effectively. In DBT, they ask us to use the skills being taught even during the times we don't need it so it becomes muscle memory and easier to grasp when we're emotionally dysregulated. (This is the reason why they ask us to keep a diary card.) 

Finally, it's great that you‚Äôre taking proactive steps to understand and manage your anger. Please consider seeking out a therapist who is the right fit for you as soon as you're able. It can change your life.",ladyhaly,False,1715757529.0

I do feel ugly when I can‚Äôt make my partner feel safe or loved.

what he achieved: causing traumatic feelings, reducing your selfworth even more.

what he MIGHT achieve: actual accomplishment of suicide with a very unstable patient. he might know that youre stronger than that.

please, the next time you see him, absolutely confront him about this and make him explain and apologize. if he wont, or god beware, even again insinuates that you should just get it over with, report the cunt.

heres a little perspective: i had a therapist who told me blatantly that the world doesnt care for me at all. boy. that hurt me massively to the point of traumatizing me. only 10 years later with way more (bad) life experiences, i gotta say: the old dude was right. he didnt mean to say ""nobody cares, me neither, fuck off"". what he meant to say was: whatever you do, another person in china wont ever know it or care for it. this is on the one hand daunting but on the other actually the reason why youre totally free to do whatever you want with your life.

1cs9p5m,"Honestly, this doesn‚Äôt seem that radical to me. The dependence on suicidal thoughts to cope is an obstacle to recovery, it sounds like your therapist was trying to get you to stop leaning on them so that you could focus on solutions instead. I once met someone at a monastery who had a monk say something similar to him while he was suicidal, and it genuinely helped him through that time in his life. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs advisable to suggest to a suicidal person to kill themselves- and I expressed this even to my fellow monastery dweller- but I do see the logic behind it and why it might work for some people. 

We have a tendency to hold this romanticized ideal of suicide in our head. It‚Äôs this thing that will solve all of our problems and make all of our pain go away. We resort to fantasizing about it instead of putting energy into actually fixing the problems in our lives. Typically, when people are forced to confront the actual possibility of death, they understand that **they really don‚Äôt want to die**. 

The kind of suicide you‚Äôre likely fantasizing about does not exist. If someone says to you: ‚Äúokay, well do it then,‚Äù you‚Äôre going to have to think about it more realistically. It‚Äôs no longer a fantasy, it‚Äôs a horrifying reality. People don‚Äôt want to die, they just want their pain to end, and there‚Äôs absolutely not a shred of evidence to suggest that suicide takes away the pain. Any set of beliefs allowing for the possibility of the afterlife will say that it is a ***really*** bad idea. If suicide were guaranteed to make things significantly worse, would you still do it? I doubt it. So it‚Äôs not the suicide you want, but the lessening of pain. 

The only way you know for sure that you have a shot at lessening your pain, is by being alive and making good decisions for yourself & putting effort into your recovery; which might mean forcing yourself to have a little hope. Your therapist can‚Äôt take a bottle of hope and cram it into your ear: the burden is ultimately still on you to recover; no one else can do it for you. If you‚Äôre expecting other people, like your therapist, to say or do something that somehow magically makes things better or easier for you, you‚Äôre going to be disappointed. It‚Äôs **your** job. It‚Äôs **your** life and **your** decisions and thoughts which will take you out of this hole you‚Äôre in- not *anyone* else‚Äôs. And you‚Äôre never going to be able to get to a position where you‚Äôre making good & healthy decisions if you keep auto-resorting to fantasizing about suicide instead of putting your energy into something that will actually help you.",Td998,False,1715776507.0

Individuals with BPD may have a pattern of undermining themselves at the moment a goal is about to be realized (e.g., dropping out of school just before graduation; regressing severely after a discussion of how well therapy is going; destroying a good relationship just when it is clear that the relationship could last). Some individuals develop psychotic-like symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, body-image distortions, ideas of reference, hypnagogic phenomena) during times of stress. Individuals with this disorder may feel more secure with transitional objects (i.e., a pet or inanimate possession) than in interpersonal relationships. Physical handicaps may result from self-inflicted abuse behaviors or failed suicide attempts. Recurrent job losses, interrupted education, and separation or divorce are common. Physical and sexual abuse, neglect, hostile conflict, and early parental loss are more common in the childhood histories of those with borderline personality disorder.

Prevalence¬†

The prevalence of BPD in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions data was 5.9%. A review of seven epidemiological studies (six in the United States) found a median prevalence of 2.7%. The prevalence of borderline personality disorder is about 6% in primary care settings, about 10% among individuals seen in outpatient mental health clinics, and about 20% among psychiatric inpatients. At any given point, 1 in 33 are experiencing BPD, and 1 in 16 will experience it at some point in their life.",aperyu-1,False,1715740972.0
1cs8ptj,"DSM: Diagnostic Features¬†

The essential feature of borderline personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and mood, and marked impulsivity that begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.¬†

Criterion 1: Individuals with BPD make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. The perception of impending separation or rejection, or the loss of external structure, can lead to profound changes in self-image, mood, cognition, and behavior. These individuals are very sensitive to environmental circumstances. They experience intense abandonment fears and inappropriate anger even when faced with a realistic time-limited separation or when there are unavoidable changes in plans (e.g., sudden despair in reaction to a clinician‚Äôs announcing the end of the hour; panic or fury when someone important to them is just a few minutes late or must cancel an appointment). They may believe that this perceived abandonment implies they are bad. These abandonment fears are related to an intolerance of being alone and a need to have other people with them. Their frantic efforts to avoid abandonment may include impulsive actions such as self-mutilating or suicidal behaviors, which are described separately in Criterion 5.¬†

Criterion 2: Individuals with BPD have a pattern of unstable and intense relationships. They may idealize potential caregivers or lovers at the first or second meeting, demand to spend a lot of time together, and share the most intimate details early in a relationship. However, they may switch quickly from idealizing other people to devaluing them, feeling that the other person does not care enough, does not give enough, or is not ‚Äúthere‚Äù enough. These individuals can empathize with and nurture other people, but only with the expectation that the other person will ‚Äúbe there‚Äù in return to meet their own needs on demand. These individuals are prone to sudden and dramatic shifts in their view of others, who may alternatively be seen as beneficent supports or as cruelly punitive. Such shifts often reflect disillusionment with a caregiver whose nurturing qualities had been idealized or whose rejection or abandonment is expected.¬†

Criterion 3: There may be an identity disturbance characterized by markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self. There are sudden and dramatic shifts in self-image (e.g., suddenly changing from the role of a needy supplicant for help to that of a righteous avenger of past mistreatment). Although they usually have a self-image that is based on the feeling of being bad or evil, individuals with this disorder may at times have feelings that they do not exist at all. This can be both painful and frightening to those with this disorder. Such experiences usually occur in situations in which the individual feels a lack of a meaningful relationship, nurturing, and support. These individuals may show worse performance in unstructured work or school situations. This lack of a full and enduring identity makes it difficult for the individual with BPD to identify maladaptive patterns of behavior and can lead to repetitive patterns of troubled relationships.¬†

Criterion 4: Individuals with borderline personality disorder display impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging. They may gamble, spend money irresponsibly, binge eat, abuse substances, engage in unsafe sex, drive recklessly, etc.

Criterion 5: Individuals with this disorder display recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats, or self-mutilating behavior. Recurrent suicidal thoughts or behavior are often the reason that these individuals present for help. These self-destructive acts are usually precipitated by threats of separation or rejection or by expectations that the individual assume increased responsibility. Self-mutilative acts (e.g., cutting or burning) are very common and may occur during periods in which the individual is experiencing dissociative symptoms. These acts often bring relief by reaffirming the individual‚Äôs ability to feel or by expiating the individual‚Äôs sense of being bad.¬†

Criterion 6: Individuals with BPD may display emotional instability that is due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days). The basic dysphoric mood of those with BPD is often disrupted by periods of anger, panic, or despair and is rarely relieved by periods of well-being or satisfaction. These episodes may reflect the individual‚Äôs extreme reactivity to interpersonal stresses.¬†

Criterion 7: Individuals with BPD may be troubled by chronic feelings of emptiness, which can co-occur with painful feelings of aloneness. Easily bored, they may frequently seek excitement or self-destructive impulses to avoid their feelings of emptiness.¬†

Criterion 8: Individuals with this disorder frequently express inappropriate, intense anger or have difficulty controlling their anger. They may display extreme sarcasm, enduring bitterness, or verbal outbursts. The anger is often elicited when a caregiver or lover is seen as neglectful, withholding, uncaring, or abandoning. Such expressions of anger are often followed by shame and guilt and contribute to the feeling they have of being bad.¬†

Criterion 9: During periods of extreme stress, transient paranoid ideation or dissociative symptoms (e.g., depersonalization) may occur, but these are generally of insufficient severity or duration to warrant an additional diagnosis. These episodes occur most frequently in response to a real or imagined abandonment. Symptoms tend to be transient, lasting minutes or hours. The real or perceived return of the caregiver‚Äôs nurturance may result in a remission of symptoms.¬†",aperyu-1,False,1715740925.0
1cs8ptj,"Gunderson on the Element of Interpersonal Hypersensitivity in BPD:

‚ÄúPeople with BPD are born with a genetic disposition to be highly sensitive and reactive to their caretakers. They are more apt to attribute rejection or anger to parental behaviors than are other children. They have usually grown up feeling that they were unfairly treated and that they did not get the attention or care they needed. They resent this and, as young adults, they hope to establish a relationship with someone who can make up to them for what they feel is missing. The desired relationship is exclusive, setting in motion intense reactions to real or perceived slights, rejections, or separations. Predictably, both their unrealistic expectations and their intense reactions cause such relationships to fail. When this happens, people with BPD will feel rejected or abandoned, and they cannot resolve their anger about being treated unfairly and their fear that they are bad and deserve the rejection. Both conclusions can lead them to become self-destructive. Their anger about being mistreated, their shame about being bad, or their self-destructive behaviors can evoke guilt or protective feelings in others. Such guilt or rescuing responses from others validate the borderline person‚Äôs unrealistically negative perceptions of mistreatment and sustain their unrealistically high expectations of having their needs met. Thus, the cycle is apt to repeat itself.‚Äù",aperyu-1,False,1715741024.0

Have you previously brought this up to your therapists?  Have you explained how previous ones have triggered you and what could be done to avoid this?  Being very upfront and open might be helpful if this isn't something that you've done, before.

1cs652o,"It's a personality disorder, changing any aspect of your personality is going to greatly differ by person. But it can happen. Shy people get over being shy and can even become great public speakers. But sometimes they can still get reminded of what made them shy in the first place.

In this case you need to change how you think, how you handle your emotions, how you view and fear things or at least build in the discipline to slow down and think through things in more rational ways. As you get older making those changes can be harder because you are stuck in your ways of thinking. However, being older also gives you more experience and wisdom, but also knowing this way hasn't worked.

Some people may not want to change, they may have learned to control their BPD or found a situation where despite their struggles they are in a situation where even if they fear abondonment or whatever issue they believe they are in the best place to avoid something worse. Those people probably won't ever change. Some get too frightened to ever try.

But if it's something you want, you can work toward it. You will likely always have moments that make you slow down and test if you want to approach life in a different way. That takes time. It takes a committment and again it starts with a change in thinking from seeing and believing in winning small battles are as important as that big overall scary future where you think every small thing leads to your greatest fear.

Also important to note that codependency is NOT a good thing. It is something we are often very prone to. But it is unhealthy and prevents healing. Gently encouraging independence is a very valuable thing. Codependence can look like needing/seeking your approval before doing things that don‚Äôt require your approval (eg.

1crxmyl,"Not sure if I have the best advice but I totally get you! First, yeah it is a BPD thing I think. I also get extremely attached to certain characters and either feel like I am them or more often want to be them. For me there is definitely an element of escapism. I have a wild mind and I often use my overactive imagination to play out fantasies so that I can cope with the pain of my life. Usually the fantasies are altered by whatever show or character I am obsessed with--I imagine myself acting as that person or being loved like they are or something similar. 

On that point, part of it for me is attaching to people that I see are loved and respected. I want to emulate them because I want to be loved and respected like they are. Not sure if any of that is relatable but that's me.

The only advice I would give is to not stress about it too much. I think that if you enjoy it and it helps you then there isn't an issue with it. It can even be motivating for self-improvement some times I've found. In your case too it might be that you connect with the character and are seeking that deeper connection more generally.

1crvnm0,"Relying on sexual relationships for validation  of your self-worth and maintaining emotional stability is an impossible situation. You cannot win. This dependency intensifies feelings of abandonment and rejection when the validation you seek isn't consistent. By their nature, casual relationships are not stable. 

First, it‚Äôs crucial to recognize that your worth and value extend far beyond external validation from any partner. Focusing on internal validation is key. This means developing a stronger sense of self-appreciation and self-love, which isn‚Äôt dependent on someone else's approval or behavior. Therapy, particularly with a clinician experienced with treating BPD, will be helpful in building these skills. 

Second, setting clear and healthy boundaries in relationships can also help manage the intensity of emotional responses. It's okay to communicate your needs and expectations with partners, but also vital to ensure these conversations are balanced with realistic expectations and self-care strategies. Have you ever thought about why you're in casual relationships at all? 

Lastly, when you feel overwhelmed, grounding techniques like deep breathing, mindfulness, or engaging in a distracting activity can help manage immediate feelings of distress. Regular physical activity, sufficient sleep, and maintaining a balanced diet also plays a role in emotional regulation.

Remember, you deserve a relationship where you feel valued and stable ‚Äî not one that leaves you feeling insecure or undervalued. Building a strong foundation of self-love and internal validation will not only help in romantic relationships but also improve your overall quality of life. If you're feeling suicidal or in a crisis, please seek help immediately from a professional or a crisis service in your area.

I think this might be what people sometimes mean when they talk about ‚Äúchoosing happiness.‚Äù Obviously no one can snap their fingers and be happy at the drop of a hat- otherwise, no one would ever be sad.

1crkvif,"Hiya,

You've got ~~mail~~ BPD! Yep!  
That's the diagnosis: Borderline Personality Disorder.  
The sub-types are not clinically recognized. That being said they are accepted and used in many areas of the mental health world. 

BPD is an expression of behaviours influenced by 9 potential criteria. There are many combinations and patterns that can exist through the BPD criteria. The sub-types help to identify particular groupings of attitudes and behaviours that can help a MH professional provide more effective resources or strategies. Someone who is destructive may need different methods from someone who is say, impulsive. At the end of the day though, we have BPD. 

The sub-types are not set in stone, nor are they exclusive. Most folks here will find they naturally lean toward one of the four but include some major behaviours from one or two of the others. Other people, like myself for example, I can think back through my history and find different periods where I exhibited each sub-type. Whatever was contextually appropriate at the time that was how my BPD presented. Whatever I was found to be lacking at the time, would influence which criteria were more effected and which sub-type I was more likely to present as. You'll see others have a history of external symptomatic expression, admitting that as they aged they became more internalised; usually because they *gain* awareness or insight into their behaviours and suddenly shy and hide away, realizing the detrimental extent of them.

How to cope? Someone to talk to definitely helps.  
It's going to help to figure out: what is missing? Identity the need for a shift. With quiet BPD we internalize most everything. Petulant is a little more wanting, needing. Are you missing (emotional) validation right now? Try and work a little bit on addressing that internal driver.

Hope this helps some.

But this is an illusion and not true. The best thing to do I believe is to make a promise to yourself to protect your inner child the way you needed someone to protect you when you were a child. This will help in two ways- you‚Äôll never expose your inner child to these kinds of abuses, because you know the damage it causes, and it‚Äôs easier for us to protect someone else than ourselves right‚Ä¶. And it will allow you to feel and acknowledge the feelings without going back, because you‚Äôve made this promise to your inner child.

That's also why pwBPD are so good at mirroring. Many great method actors are on cluster B continuums.

What I am sure caused further damage in that department was an entire childhood of being referred to as the ""weird"" or ""quirky"" ones so I felt ashamed of the few things I knew I liked and that led to me being someone that absolutely did not feel genuine to me which made it all even worse. I am 35 and just in the last year becoming comfortable and confident in who I am enough to express it outside my home. Like, fuck yah, I am wearing hot pink leggings and a tank top with skull hands cupping my boobs on it (ü§£) where as years ago if I tried that I would feel embarrassed and kinda make myself small to take attention off of me. 

All that being said I have no easy suggestion because I picked it all up from my husband. He is a personality and a half and also has quite a unique style and he is so damn unapologetic of it, I have admired that about him since the day we met and it just slowly brought me out of my shell. I had also just recently stopped working stuffy office jobs that kept my wardrobe bland and basic and just not me so it was an interesting experience to rebuild my wardrobe with all the quirky, bright, weird stuff I love!

In my experience, at the core of knowing who we are is clear registration of our emotional responses to things. But people with BPD really struggle with that.

At the same time we will stay with people way too long because of our fear of being alone. Even though we hold the resentment in us from these other instances. It eventually, if your BPD isnt fully checked, does manage to leak out too many times and makes sure the relationship ends. Often after you've spent way too long for the person and managed to give even more of your life to them, losing more and more of yourself into the relationship.

1) it‚Äôs awesome to talk to your partner about things that trigger you, but it also is on you to realize that sometimes those things still happen. I make plans with my friend and he doesn‚Äôt show up, and I get really angry and then it turns out there was an emergency. Or he didn‚Äôt realize we made plans. It‚Äôs taking a lot of work to get to the point where I can calm myself through that. One thing that has helped is for me to make up good reasons why he didn‚Äôt show up, rather than assuming the bad ones. Rather than thinking, he simply does not care that we had plans, I try to make a list of reasons it might have happened that aren‚Äôt his fault or aren‚Äôt about me. Again, that‚Äôs taken a lot of work to get there though

2) Make a plan for what to do after or during. As you said, you‚Äôve talked to them about what triggers it, but it has helped me a ton to talk about what helps in the moment, when it‚Äôs happening. I know that it is really hard to let go of the anger and hurt that I feel after an incident. That lingers. But figuring out what you need in the moment can make a big difference, along with communicating to your partner what exactly it looks like when you‚Äôre splitting. How can they tell the difference between you splitting and a regular argument or bad mood? My friend has a tendency to pick apart conversations and wording in arguments and that made things so much worse. He now stops and asks questions like ‚Äúwhat does that mean?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt really read the tone of that, can you tell me?‚Äù Obviously if a person says those things in a snippy way they can provoke things, but when said in a way where they genuinely want to understand it forces me to pause and really think about what I‚Äôm saying and what I‚Äôm trying to get across.

There‚Äôs a reason you‚Äôre his 7th marriage. There will be an 8th and it won‚Äôt be because you divorced and remarried him.‚Äù 

I refused to hear it, said fuck off to all of them, and then when it ended up horrifyingly abusive, I called my friend crying to her over and over. 

She ended up suffering because she would BEG me to leave him, BEG, and I would refuse. She‚Äôd end up in tears also, and worried herself sick about me. She eventually told me she couldn‚Äôt talk to me about my marriage anymore because it was actually hurting her. It was a revelatory moment for me, truly. I actually stopped talking to anyone about it until after I had actually left him, some months later. I realized my venting and looking for support was really just a stand-in for what I actually needed to do to help myself‚Äî LEAVE. 

He tried to tell me that I was just another person in his life who refused to have compassion for him and stay with him through thick and thin, etc etc but I realized I would continue to be miserable unless I left. It made me realize that my own issues are really truly not for anyone else to help me with unless they are a licensed professional, and I shouldn‚Äôt everrrr expect anyone to hold space for me *especially* at their own expense. 

Now I am happily married and have been for the past couple years to someone who is healthy, and I am very aware that my disorder can and will and *SHOULD* lead to the end of it if I do not continue to manage it properly so that I am not abusing my spouse.

I taught him that it‚Äôs never okay if someone does something unfair to him, they actually have to do better, and if they don‚Äôt do better, then you shouldn‚Äôt be their friend anymore. 

My episodes are few and far between now, it‚Äôs mostly small reactions that still just don‚Äôt make any sense in context but they‚Äôre small at least.

1crpnif,"The part of our brain responsible for sexual arousal is the same part that lights up when it has experienced trauma over time, and the same part that lights up when it comes to drug addiction \[long term\]. The reason people stay in abusive relationships is because they are addictive. Legitimately addictive.   
  
Our brains are organs that are wired to learn through repetition, and because we tend to bury trauma in order to survive, we latch onto the *intensity* in order to do so. We teach ourselves that trauma is good, mostly so we can keep breathing. But that is how we get into these cycles of negative relationships. People with CPTSD & long-term, debilitating trauma that is the result of abuse have this problem as well.

They look past every flaw and explain it away because they don‚Äôt want to believe the alternative. And to face the facts, people with bpd can be very guilty of this when splitting and going through their illness. It‚Äôs the reason why there‚Äôs so many horror stories and talk around surviving people with bpd. I don‚Äôt agree with how it often labels bpd as a whole but you can‚Äôt deny the reason why. 

Someone that‚Äôs neurotypical may want to stay through the abuse because they know of the others illness. People may stay as they‚Äôre afraid their abusive partner may hurt themself after leaving. The list goes on and on.

There‚Äôs also other sides where sometimes personality disorders can be very alluring to even healthy individuals. I know thus from seeing my own behaviour. I can be very charming, I can be super loving and attentive, and that can be a trap. Therefore it definitely is not something the victim needs to take full responsibility for.

I understand people should see all sides of things, we have issues and they should not just project onto us their own. But abusive relationships, and not all people with bpd are abusive or alluring therefore the people that hold grudges and blame us all are not doing any help, yes you may realise you are in one and need to get yourself out, but you may also not wven have a clue for years before painful damage is done.

Im trying to say we both have our faults and rights in this. If you are aware of your abusive behaviour, personality disorders are no excuse. Work on yourself and warn the other if you can. When you can let them go it is not their fault for being drawn in. And if you are not aware, same for someone in an abusive relationship, you cannot just tell them to leave and not ‚Äòpoint fingers‚Äô.

Trauma does some wild things to the human brain, you will literally look past anything if you feel like the person may love you, and you won't be alone.

I read an interesting article that stated people are addicted to the highs from different types of abuse, especially if that's something they're used to.

1crpnif,"Yeah, very this. On average it takes over 10 tries to leave an abusive relationship. Not at all saying the BPD is why they're abusive, but chronic cheating, or other abusive behaviors are just as hard to leave when your partner is BPD then when they're not. If not harder because of how common love bombing or threatening self harm is when pwBPD act when they think you're going to leave them/when you attempt to leave them. 

Also, ND people are more likely to be in an abusive relationship and believe they deserve that abuse than NT people. When you're told your whole life that you are the problem you learn to accept that in your intimate relationships. It doesn't mean they want the abuse or deserve it because they find it hard to leave. It just means they've been conditioned to accept that treatment- which makes it even harder to leave. A LOT of ND people are told they will never find anyone who loves or accepts them. So they cling onto even very toxic relationships because they're afraid.

Telling a victim that they don't want resolution because they stay in an abusive relationship is just victim blaming. There's nothing else you can say about that.",lotteoddities,False,1715718148.0

The way I've approached it was the way I approached it with my dad when he had cancer, knowledge, acceptance, communication and logic

Honestly sometimes bpd is harder to deal with, because it can only be managed, not cured. 

I've learned DBT and CBT which help communication, and I've established talking about how something made me feel, or how she felt. 2 years ago she wouldn't communicate feelings. 

Seeking validation can happen very quickly, so knowing the signs of low self worth before hand and working through that together has been fundamental.

I stayed at home for my dad, I didn't let him go through it without support, and I stay with my wife and work on her coping mechanisms with her daily. 

It doesn't matter the illness if you love someone you stay, they have no or few spoons, so let them have some of yours.

1croqmm,"# Vulnerable Child

You harbor a deep sense of vulnerability and insecurity, stemming from past experiences of neglect, abandonment, or invalidation during your formative years. Deep down, you feel fragile, powerless, and exposed, leading to a pervasive sense of fear and anxiety about the world around you. You carry a longing for love, acceptance, and security, but you have difficulties facing that longing. Your underlying vulnerability fuels both your desire for connection and a deep fear of rejection.

You seek reassurance and protection from others, avoiding situations that trigger feelings of insecurity, or reacting with extreme sensitivity to perceived criticism or rejection. You feel unseen, unheard, and undeserving of love and validation, contributing to a pattern of self-doubt and fragility.

Watch for these signs:

1. **Hypersensitivity:**¬†You react with heightened sensitivity to perceived threats or criticisms, becoming easily overwhelmed by negative emotions. Perceived slights or lack of attention trigger anxiety and insecurity. Small setbacks or rejections evoke fear, shame, or sadness, leading to emotional outbursts or withdrawal.
2. **Avoidance of Risk:**¬†You avoid taking risks or stepping outside of your comfort zone due to a fear of failure or rejection. You feel you lack safety and security, preferring to stay within familiar boundaries rather than risk re-experiencing the hurt and disappointment you were subjected to earlier in life.
3. **Dependency on Others:**¬†You rely heavily on others for validation, reassurance, and support, seeking to fulfill unmet emotional needs from your childhood through relationships with others. You feel a deep-seated fear of abandonment or rejection, leading to clingy or over-investing behaviors in your relationships.
4. **Feelings of Inadequacy:**¬†You struggle with feelings of inadequacy, worthlessness, or inferiority, believing that you are fundamentally flawed or unlovable. These negative self-perceptions stem from past experiences of neglect or criticism, reinforcing a sense of unworthiness and self-doubt in you. When you feel insecure, you experience sudden emotional swings, particularly sadness or anger. Your emotional volatility is confusing for others and creates interpersonal conflict.
5. **Difficulty Asserting Boundaries:**¬†You have difficulty asserting your own needs and boundaries in relationships, fearing rejection if you express yourself authentically. You prioritize the needs of others over your own, sacrificing your own well-being in an effort to avoid the vulnerability of feeling isolated and alone.

Your coping mode can have significant implications for your emotional well-being and relationships. Untreated, it leads to feelings of chronic anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, as well as difficulties in forming and maintaining healthy connections with others.

It plays into the whole mindfulness letting it go. You may find letting those thoughts go lessens the severity and quantity of them. I don‚Äôt understand my inner monologue and honestly I don‚Äôt want to because it‚Äôs feels like a waste of energy. Kinda in the same department of trying to decipher dreams, I just leave it as mind human and we are complex‚Ä¶.and let the scientists understand it üò¨

I can‚Äôt speak for everyone but I wager a lot of people have irrational/intrusive thoughts. I will open up on this topic for me personally. I for the longest time and still are partly am really sensitive to emotional cues/reading people. This was because I projected all the thoughts about others, others had about me secretly. It made the intrusive thoughts a lot worse because I was constantly aware of them when they are happening. 

Another part of my internal monologue it is doesn‚Äôt represent who I am. I work hard to better my self and I am damaged so there is going to be internal monologue that is not me, sometimes it will be I wanna punch this person in the face. Other times it will be judgmental for whatever reason. Still it could be a completely bigoted thought that I absolutely disagree with 100%. Does that make me a bad person? No those are just thoughts, I don‚Äôt act upon them, let them influence my life or say them. I learn to forgive myself and keep working on myself. I hate with a passion my internal dialogue but I have to let it go otherwise it consumes me. 

I shared that be to let you know it‚Äôs ok to feel the way you feel. Feeling irrational sucks but don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it. You acknowledged it, didn‚Äôt act upon it and moved forward. The more you repeat this pattern the less power it has over you. 

I agree that is frustrating having to deal with a person who treats you like a child. If anything, buy your own shower catch. Swap it out when you shower and swap theirs back when you are done.

1cridbg,"> I understand this concept but my question is when does it become too much? For instance, hitler.

Okay so none of what I said is a prescription for how to talk about OTHER people. That is a different subject altogether. 

I'm also not recommending using those words and that manner of speech when we are talking to others about ourselves and our behavior. Again, that is a different subject altogether. 

My comment is specific to our self-talk, and in fact it is specifically about self-talk when we are trying to heal from our diseases and dysfunction. When we are coming up with coping skills to deal with our own bad behavior, what is the healthiest way to think about what we have done? This is where my comment applies.

This doesn't mean I'm recommending that we lie to ourselves or fudge the truth when we talk to others. When I say talking about others is a different subject and talking to others about our actions is another different subject, that may sound like I'm encouraging storytelling - but I'm not. I'm advocating ***considering the needs of each person in each of these occasions, and picking the most appropriate set of truths to tell in each case***. 

- If you are talking about Hitler to a congregation of Jewish people on Holocaust remembrance day, you will talk about Hitler as a monster because that is the most relevant truth about Hitler for that occasion for the set of people in question. 

- If you are talking about Hitler in a sociology class where the topic is macroeconomics and geopolitics, you will talk about Hitler as a phenomenon shaped by the political and economic conditions of the Weimar Republic, because that is the most relevant truth about Hitler for that occasion for the set of people having this discussion. 

- If Hitler came back to life magically today and asked me for advice on what he should say to the public at a press conference about his resurrection, I would tell him to admit responsibility for his monstrous actions, DO NOT MENTION THAT HE HAS A GOOD SIDE TOO, acknowledge the immense destruction and loss he is responsible for, commit his resources to make amends, etc. That would be the most appropriate truth about himself that Hitler would need to speak, considering the needs of the occasion and his audience. 

- If Hitler magically came back to life today and sought therapy to fix himself and his bad behavior, then.... ***my comment applies to him there.*** Nobody can fix their own behavior by relentlessly shaming themselves and splitting themselves all bad (or all good!). A balanced view of oneself is necessary for personal healing. Hitler SHOULD tell himself that he is a mixture of both bad and good, so that he can reinforce his good qualities and stop acting on his bad impulses. This is the truth that is the most relevant to him in his self-talk when he is focused on healing. 

All of the above are truths about Hitler: a lot of people have good reasons to see him as a monster, that Hitler as a phenomenon didn't happen all by himself but rather he was empowered by the political and economic conditions of the Wiemar Republic, the only acceptable speech from him today would be one where he takes responsibility for his monstrous actions without pleading that he has good in him, AND the only way he could possibly fix himself is by focusing on developing his good side - which means he must acknowledge to himself that he has a good side and keep it in mind always.

But it just ends there. There's no accountability, so steps towards change. They want the label, and that's all. 

Social media can say whatever it wants, but I don't validate self-diagnosis. If a client comes to me with something like that, we will absolutely have a discussion about it. We'll talk about their concerns, how they came to that conclusion, and any symptoms they might be experiencing. But I will make it very clear that they are not diagnosed on paper, and I will not diagnose them unless I have good reason to believe they have the disorder they're concerned about.

In high school, I had really dramatic falling outs with several friends, but it was truly for the best and those people did not care who they hurt. Something I still struggle with is that I‚Äôm good at identifying people who will hurt my friends, but my friends give people the benefit of the doubt more than me.

Romantically, I feel like a shit show to be honest. I have a very kind and loving boyfriend, but he triggers me all the time because he‚Äôs not careful about what he says and he doesn‚Äôt make sense to me and does things that are unintentionally severely harmful. At the same time, I find myself still in love with someone I‚Äôve been friends with forever, who is very much like me, but very calm, understanding, and has expressed that he is in love with me mutually for years. I feel totally safe with him. But it‚Äôs never something we‚Äôve ever actually pursued with one another, and are both very respectful of our partners who are monogamous (even though we‚Äôre both poly). That is a uniquely weird situation to be in. We would have dated, but I was afraid I would show him my worst side and it would scare him. And quite frankly, his friendship has always been the most important thing. My boyfriend, on the other hand, is extremely dear to me and my favorite person ever to be around and spend time with. He makes me super happy and we can talk forever. But he makes me so uncomfortable too. Like when I said I didn‚Äôt want to go on a trip today, he was like ‚Äúwell, the women I‚Äôm staying at the hostel with want to go‚Äù. So I was like ‚Äúthen go with them, date them‚Äù. He said no, but I felt really triggered from that interaction. And we have many instances like that but much worse. It doesn‚Äôt help that he is only friends with girls and only with women he meets online that I never meet or know anything about. So it always makes me feel like something sketchy is going on, even when he has never been anything but faithful.¬†",intjeepers,False,1715662429.0

And obsessions with random things, topics and people is something that is quote common in adhd, autism and other types of neurodivergence. In bpd people, it can have a lot to do with our sense of self or lack thereof. Pwbpd tend to cycle through hobbies quickly but intensely. Try to enjoy the ride, we get to experience a lot of different things and while it might hinder our ability to ever get really good or knowledgeable about anything specific, we do get to have a lot of different cool experiences along the way!

1creouf,"The video's title alone is discouraging enough. It suggests that the ""therapist"" may be resorting to harmful labels or even promoting these damaging stereotypes. Posting such content only intensifies the existing stigma surrounding this topic. Ironically, it reinforces the same black and white thinking that everyone, including people with BPD, tends to engage in. It categorizes people into good and bad, abuser and victim, which only heightens the toxic shame experienced by individuals like us, furthering the false belief that we are inherently flawed or evil.

We shouldn't perpetuate binary narratives in this space, even when the BPD diagnostic criteria might seem to reinforce such narratives. Responses that shame and invalidate individuals prevent open discussion about their behavior, discouraging them and others who relate from ever speaking up.

This behaviour is probably a maladaptive survival response likely stemming from early experiences. Your first comment uses DBT language, which while helpful in regulating emotions and reducing their intensity, it doesn't address the underlying causes.

1cre1o7,">He is very into spirituality now and has determined he doesn't need therapy or medication anymore and that he doesn't actually have BPD.

This, right here, is the problem. He (theoretically) knows that he has BPD. That means that he should, ideally, be able to get into treatment for it and work on managing his symptoms (and make no mistake, the way he's treating you are symptoms of BPD). The issue is that he's convinced himself that he's not actually being subjected to the disorder that he has. That's really fucking dangerous for anyone to do, but it's especially rough for someone with BPD to do. Our symptoms *need* to be managed, and the worst thing we can do is convince ourselves we don't have those symptoms at all.

I don't wanna tell you that you need to get away from this person or whatever. I don't know your life like you do. But I will say that the last person I knew who had convinced themself they were cured of their BPD was my abuser. It's such a dangerous mindset to get into, and it's going to result in stuff like this where he acts in a way that is obviously dysregulated, but which he insists is rational. You just can't manage your BPD if you refuse to even acknowledge that it's there, and that ends up with people - like you - getting hurt.

1cra8gn,"Hey friend. I SO relate to this post. I recently quit smoking weed almost 3 months ago now after over 10 years of daily use. I smoked daily for similar reasons to you, and also wanted to quit for similar reasons. My biggest thing is that I just don‚Äôt want to need something like that to be okay anymore. 
I wanted to quit for about a year before being able to, but I knew that I would when I was ready, and I did. 

I think it‚Äôs extremely important to give yourself a lot of Grace as you move through this. If you do decide to quit, try changing up your routine as much as possible, and probably getting rid of all of your stash unless you have tremendous self control. For me, I‚Äôm a stubborn fuck. That can come in handy in situations like this. Once I make my mind up about something, I‚Äôm doing it 100%. All or nothing, am I right? lol

The first month wasn‚Äôt as hard as I thought I‚Äôd be, mostly physical symptoms as I worked through lack of appetite, and differences in sleep. I recommend trying magnesium, and melatonin for nightly relaxation and helping you fall asleep. Melatonin is a life saver when it comes to this. At 3 months after quitting, I don‚Äôt need the melatonin unless I‚Äôm pretty overstimulated. And honestly, my sleep is so so SO much better now. I really enjoy having dreams again, and I just overall feel like sleeping is more productive. My appetite is back to full force too, like super full force. I‚Äôm actually hungrier after quitting. But during the time you‚Äôre going through withdrawal, I‚Äôd try having some milk, protein shakes, easy snacks on hand. 

After the first month, I had some shit show up for me that reminded me why I using in the first place. I had about a week long episode of being really really not okay. I was able to reach out to my therapist at that time, which helped A LOT at making me not feel crazy. But I had to remind myself over and over and over again WHY I am doing this. Because if I choose to just go back to smoking when these hard emotions show up, I‚Äôm never going to progress or really learn how to manage myself, and Heal. I found what was really hidden underneath my daily baked buzz and it was unsettling. But I know it‚Äôs something I have to work through, and I promise you, it‚Äôs gotten easier and easier and easier. I‚Äôm so grateful I stayed strong over that week. It actually helped me learn that my hard moments and feelings actually do pass. 
Which felt like a huge revelation after stuffing them down with weed all these years. 

I feel like I am slowly coming to a normal baseline. And I truly am not missing feeling so spaced all of the time, and having the want to smoke hanging over me ALL the time. I feel like I can actually be a bit more present with myself and others.

This time I‚Äôm 5 months in and have lost 32 lbs and I am actually enjoying getting all my steps in and lifting weights. What I learned was you need to start super super small. I started by just getting a cheap thing to track my steps then trying to increase my steps an extra 2,000 (less than a mile) each day. When the number I was aiming for got easy I‚Äôd increase another 2,000. When I got to 10,000 (4 miles) each day and it wasn‚Äôt too bad I added in one day a week of body weight exercises. It was literally once a week for 20 minutes or so to start getting my heart rate up. When that was easy and well implemented into my schedule I added a second day of the same thing. When that was easy I started incorporating weights, then increased the amount of time I was working out, then added a 3rd day. I was building so much muscle the scale stopped going down as consistently so I started walking 20,000 (8 miles) steps a day.

Now I do 20,000 steps every day, I workout for 45 minutes with weights 3 times a week. I‚Äôve been losing weight steadily and every time an issue comes up I just adjust what I‚Äôm doing but all that starting from just 2,000 steps.

I had negative views going into group therapy as well however I decided if I REALLY wanted to see change in myself I needed to jump into it with everything I had and I have no regrets doing so. 

Group therapy offers things that one-on-one therapy cannot....I've never felt so seen and understood in my life. It was refreshing to hear stories and emotions that were similar to mine. I didn't feel like I was alone in my struggles anymore and was highly insightful! 

Luckily, drug tests weren't required however....they are there for a reason and if I had to do them, I would. 
DBT skills will teach you how to cope with your needs/wants and how to adapt to ""wise mind"" thinking. 
You won't be the only one there who is going through this so, you'll have each other (scary at first but, I was really sad when our little group ended) and you'll also have the Dr/Psychiatrist there for support as well. 

One extra thing I will mention is don't be afraid to talk about your true feelings...it's so important not to hide behind a facade because you're worried about judgement....you won't learn anything about how to deal with them if you're not honest about them either to yourself or the group.

1cr5jtu,"I understand (more or less) what you're going through. Unfortunately. I have tried to handle similar situations for too many years. I will share a few things that have been important to me. Note that this is subjective and it may not suit you. 

1) Be honest with yourself. Try not to fight against thoughts of jealousy. Accept that the feeling exists within you without 'fighting against it'. 

2) Be honest with your partner in a way that suits you both. Try to express yourself in a neutral way without shifting blame or feelings onto him. For example, 'When you say you're going out to the pub with your friends, I feel a fear that you will leave me'. Like that. Neutral. Non-judgmental. Just stating the fact. He might find it easier to meet your feelings if they come to the surface in this way. 

3) Be careful to identify your thought patterns. Observe when you try to shift blame or when you project your feelings of jealousy onto him in a bad way. 

4) Do not argue against your feelings. If you have a 'feeling' of being left or jealousy - you cannot logically argue with it. It just doesn't work. Instead, try to let the feeling 'be there' without fighting it (like point 1) 

5) Try to find a friend to confide in when things are toughest. Someone where you can unfilteredly get rid of your shame. Jealousy is strongly associated with shame. Let the shame go. It serves no function; it just holds you back. A friend might be better able to handle this than your partner. 

6) Try to find a good middle ground. You explain non-judgmentally how you feel about your boyfriend going out to the pub. You both agree on a way that works well. For example, he could call once during the evening and send a text later. Or something. Just an example. But it sounds like he is willing to wait and engage in an alliance. You can solve this together. 

And last but not least. Believe in yourself. You can handle more than you think. Even the toughest emotions are 'just' emotions. Try to breathe, see beyond it. Take care of yourself.",ManagementDramatic30,False,1715626059.0

1cr56kt,"I think if you're early in the diagnosis. It may feel very much like appropriate, normal behavior to do the mental gymnastics you do to avoid every kind of accountability you can pervasively. However big or small. You've learned already that anything that sets off any emotional reaction could lead to a heavy imbalance which for you is just naturally a severe state of pain and perhaps impossible to do regulation, it's true agony. Whether or not you've actually recognized and verbalized this to yourself, your brain had already gone and started planning ahead in every single scenario it can to just... avoid any single extra need to your psyche that might even introduce the possibility of emotional bandwidth being requested of you, because you don't have it. To you it's not avoidance, to you it's necessary self preservation, so there's absolutely nothing wrong with the excuses, they're not excuses, they are logical, it is self preservation, you don't have the time, this is necessary, and your priorities are correct for where you're needs are at this point in life.

Unfortunately this does not work out for yo√π in the long run, especially if youd like to gun for remission, which i am fucking elated to be sitting here and typing to you is absolutely fucking possible and real and i personally subscribe more to the notion that some neuropsychs like to subscribe to of being cured, not just having relapse-remitting symptoms. It just only seems to make sense that way, with me anyways. I worked my ass off to build an identity and love myself and fill the emptiness and learn proper mentalization and cognitive and emotional empathy skills as well as ther difference between natural and parasitic anger and how to promote one without the other and how to form and keep my boundaries that... how the fuck do you relapse-remit an entire way of being and living and knowing yourself and relating to others and the world around you and restructuring your entire cognitive framework? Lol

Anyways... that's not actually self preservation, to continue with my previous paragraph. That's cognitive dissonance to a bandaid on a leak of a sinking ship. That's cognitive dissonance to the refusal to bring yourself to sit with the discomfort you've never let yourself actually be challenged to sit with or face before. For as much as you think it is about making excuses not to get up an hour early, it's everything to do with not facing yourself, your toxic traits and behaviors, and your unprocessed trauma that will at some point in your life, if it's the big T, force you to choose between surviving and thriving if you don't choose to unburden the load of your own volition. This shit with not wanting to do the more obvious and the more benevolent bullshit in your life is only indicative of toxic behaviors you are likely permitting within yourself, that are probably BPD related if not directly stemming from, that you have a more deeply ingrained unconscious refusal to see for yourself at this point. Im sure it's likely been years that you've been subconsciously rationalizing, as mostly a survival mechanism, many BPD behaviors that you'd look back in hindsight with gratitude for any progress made towards removing from your tendencies once the ability to know them and see them and catch them as they happen is gained.

For me, personally, it took about 2 years after the notion was planted in my mind that i had a capacity at all for shitty things i didn't want to be doing without my knowledge and furthermore i had capabilities beyond my previously thought capacity for shittiness. Emotional manipulation, honestly it would be fair to say i likely emotionally abused people. Fits of rage not at all scaled to the situation ther rage was triggered by. Blatantly selfish behavior that i had don't nothing to curb, this posts reminds mr her most of myself with that. The self centric cognitive framework that took years. I just bury fucking got it, because being self centric read they only thing i could do to survive for years or get any kind of want or need in my life. When the wars were all over, no one told my self centrist mfass. The world revolved around me, but if you asked mr what my problem was, i'd have called you a piece of shit human for not inferring your own iceberg of subtext buried in my life to explain the self preservation. Still today i work out thur behaviors with that specifically because it was such a life long survival skill, 10 years later. Don't think enough people in treatment admit to what they had and did in their cognitive capacity pre-treatment. I believe it would really really really smooth out the entry road for new comers trying to grab the bull by the horns. 

Don't shut away from yourself, the sooner you look at everything, ther sooner you can put it to rest forever and become the person you're capable of being in all authenticity, instead of just in display, as a show, as long as you are percieved right. Zero excuses, make your life harder so it can get easier, that is literally how it works. You don't get a better life by doing easy work. If you're not crying in therapy regularly, it's easy right now. Imo. Reducing your suffering, improving your quality of life, becoming a better person, the person you want to be in all authenticity in a way that's going to last, that takes your blood, sweat, and tears. Not an extra hour of sleep and turning a blind eye to the parts of you that give you the ick. You can't unsee and unthink parts about yourself you don't enjoy. It's work. Nothing more nothing less.

Only solution I‚Äôve found so far is just to not mention those kinds of multi-part problems to people and work through them on my own, since it‚Äôs easier to find solutions when people aren‚Äôt yelling at me for being lazy and not wanting to help myself.

Also: self-compassion is a huge thing. When I struggle with this, I pretend I have a kid with the same issue and talk to them about it, then try and give whatever advice I‚Äôd give the kid to myself. Eg. I‚Äôm struggling to get myself to try meeting new people because terrified of rejection, acrophobia, germ phobia, terrible social skills etc. So I imagine if I had a kid who was terrified of meeting new people at school, what would I say to them? I wouldn‚Äôt berate them for being lazy or dumb and tell them to suck it up and push through it (my parents doing that to me is part of why I‚Äôm like this ffs). I would ask questions and listen, validate their feelings, then gently suggest little things to help that actually feel manageable.

For me at least, 90% of my issues with this kinda stuff is just a chronic lack of emotional validation and compassion from other people my whole life. When I can give that to myself, even just in tiny bursts, it helps immensely.

I never went back to her, but it made me so scared to open up to anyone about it because I was worried that they would think that I ""wanted it"" and was lying about it. 

I did grow up with trauma, which I think really primed me to stay in the abusive situation. He controlled me and my sister financially and threatened us (the day that I went to the police he texted me saying he was going to kill me, sue me for slander and get a restraining order against me) and pretty much bribed me to keep my mouth shut, although I really had no choice to take the money. I kept telling myself that it's better than being homeless, the streets aren't safe. My sister grew up in a different household (half siblings, lived with her Dad) but also fell for him hook line and sinker and didn't believe me when I left and everything came out. He denied everything and she took his side. As if threatening to kill me when I went to the cops wasn't a red flag sign of guilt enough.

1cr1r4l,"In the UK they are very reticent to diagnose EUPD (also known as BPD; the UK National Health Service officially uses EUPD and rarely BPD); or any other personality disorder.

I think it‚Äôs because they operate on a triage system where they treat immediate symptomology and then work upwards from there; so they‚Äôll first work from an assumption of no issue, then anxiety and/or depression, and they‚Äôll only consider alternatives if you keep presenting. Even then, it‚Äôs highly unlikely you‚Äôll get a psych referral unless you happen to get triaged by one in hospital or you really demand one.

Even with a psych referral; they‚Äôll still be reluctant to put a PD label on you; one because they‚Äôre aware of the stigma; but second because they know they don‚Äôt have good services for long term complex mental health. 

At that stage if you‚Äôre lucky you might join a waitlist for group DBT; it‚Äôs 2 years long in my part of London. 

After doing something like DBT; apart from local community mental health drop ins like a crisis cafe or local social clubs, and/or medication, that‚Äôs sort of it.

I know it sounds bleak, it is. The NHS really isn‚Äôt well set up for helping EUPD/BPD. 

In my case, despite having documented SI, alcohol problems and OD attempts from 16 into my 30‚Äôs, i was still told it was ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù. In the end I pursued a private diagnosis. Even there, they were very hesitant to commit the diagnosis to paper; not because i didn‚Äôt have but quote ‚Äúyou might get better treatment without them knowing this‚Äù. 

With that I was able to get access to secondary psych services past the initial CBT stage, but it was 12 session of therapy and that was it; job done. 

I was referred to a complex trauma pathway but told my alcohol issues made me too ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù. With great effort i abstained for 12m and asked them to re-assess; this time because i‚Äôd SI i was also too high risk. I sought help to reduce that and asked to be re-assessed again and they said I didn‚Äôt meet the criteria üôÉ

If I only had the experiences of NHS ‚Äúhelp‚Äù to go on i‚Äôd be in such a sorry state. I am incredibly indebted to one fantastic private therapist who took me on for low money so i could access very stabilising long term therapy. I give up so many things in order to continue that, but it‚Äôs been worth it. 

My advice to anyone navigating the NHS system would be to advocate for yourself as strongly as possible; don‚Äôt take no for an answer and keep pushing and exploring. At the same time, be mindful of it‚Äôs limitations. If you have any funds whatsoever to consider private support, you might find that these can change your life.

1cqzs1b,"After his diagnosis, was he set up with a therapist/psychologist to see regularly? 
Sounds like he needs major support and help with his anger. 
It's sad to say I understand his outbursts, and it sounds like how I used to be. 
But with the right help and (medication for me), I have come a long way. 
It is tricky with relationships and BPD, as I'm sure you've read. Speaking from personal experience, I don't mean anything I say during an outburst. It's almost like a compulsive coping mechanism to get the sudden build-up of frustration out. Once calmed, the brain can think clearly again (which is when the apologies float in).
Honestly, I feel terrible for the crap my partner has had to put up with from time to time. But I have been very open about my BPD since the start, and it is something we work on together. True love conquers BPD, in my opinion.
 If you really love someone, you will go through the ups and downs with them.
I'm sorry you have had some terrible things said to you. But I'm sure he does not mean any of it. bpd is not an excuse, but it is something to research well about during a rationship to really understand. 
Maybe you can have a sit-down conversation about the help he needs and even find some ways to work around the outbursts together.",Floralees,False,1715611686.0

BPD & Interpersonal Hypersensitivity: Is this an accurate description?

Gunderson on the Element of Interpersonal Hypersensitivity:

‚ÄúPeople with BPD are born with a genetic disposition to be highly sensitive and reactive to their caretakers. They are more apt to attribute rejection or anger to parental behaviors than are other children. They have usually grown up feeling that they were unfairly treated and that they did not get the attention or care they needed. They resent this and, as young adults, they hope to establish a relationship with someone who can make up to them for what they feel is missing. The desired relationship is exclusive, setting in motion intense reactions to real or perceived slights, rejections, or separations. Predictably, both their unrealistic expectations and their intense reactions cause such relationships to fail. When this happens, people with BPD will feel rejected or abandoned, and they cannot resolve their anger about being treated unfairly and their fear that they are bad and deserve the rejection. Both conclusions can lead them to become self-destructive. Their anger about being mistreated, their shame about being bad, or their self-destructive behaviors can evoke guilt or protective feelings in others. Such guilt or rescuing responses from others validate the borderline person‚Äôs unrealistically negative perceptions of mistreatment and sustain their unrealistically high expectations of having their needs met. Thus, the cycle is apt to repeat itself.‚Äù

In general people avoid accountability for their actions, that's why there is so much hypocrisy in the world.

It differentiates, from person to person there are habits and ways a person with bpd can be. Depends really hard on what kind of relationship you have.

1cqrezy,"For me, the fear of abandonment, chronic feelings of emptiness, and the mood swings are the most notable things. I don‚Äôt tend to lash out at others. Instead, I internalize it. Like you, I just love to hate myself lol. Well, hate is a strong word, I don‚Äôt constantly hate myself anymore, but sometimes I do. When I‚Äôm mad, I take it out on me. It used to be in the form of self harm. It was one of, but not the only reason I self harmed. I wanted to hurt myself as a way to take my anger out on someone and that someone was me. I am also a huge people pleaser and now I realize that I am because in my mind, it‚Äôs the only way to make sure they don‚Äôt leave. I usually end up like, begging others not to leave me or like worrying that they hate me if they don‚Äôt talk to me after a while, even if they have a good reason. My mood can swing really drastically from being super happy and euphoric to crashing and feeling really depressed and kinda suicidal. I‚Äôm pretty good at masking emotions and how I really feel and am so people usually don‚Äôt notice. Most people don‚Äôt realize I have a bunch of mental health issues. I always feel empty and like there‚Äôs this huge hole inside me that nothing fills. Unhealthy coping mechanisms gave me the illusion that that hole wasn‚Äôt there, but it always was. Strong emotions make me tear apart inside. Like if im in a room and all four walls and the roof are coming in and trying to crush me and all I can do is scream but it doesn‚Äôt stop. But on the outside I seem okay and happy. A huge part of quiet bpd is just how everything is internalized and it‚Äôs just really painful and exhausting. I also struggle a lot with my identity and the question of who I really am. I find myself wanting to escape to a place where I can be myself while at the same time, having no idea who I even am. I dunno if that makes sense. When I split, I break down inside. If I‚Äôm splitting, it‚Äôs like if I can‚Äôt hear anything and all these thoughts race to my head and it‚Äôs just really painful and emotional exhausting. I rarely lash out at others, but it does happen from time to time, usually when I‚Äôm getting really bad and someone is with me when I can‚Äôt take it anymore, they become the person I take it out on. I hate that I do that, so I usually just remove myself from others and stay alone until I‚Äôve let everything out through healthy coping mechanisms like journaling. Okay, this reply is already like super long lol. But this is my experience. It‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs experience and there‚Äôs definitely things I left out and it‚Äôs very in depth, but yeah.

[Home]

You are walking along a path. You look around, noticing your surroundings. This path leads you to a house. Only you can see the house, really picture it in your mind's eye. You walk up to the house, and knock on the door. Your 10 year old self answers the door, and they are so *excited* to see you. They invite you in, and want to hear all about you, what you've been up to, how you're doing, what you've learned. They love you unconditionally, and are so proud of you for being you and living through what you have. Inside this house is every version of you that has existed, from newborn until now. You are home.

You can talk to any past version of yourself whenever you want, they live within you. Talk with them. Understand them. Learn from them. Love them, as they love you. Love yourself and be kind, give yourself grace and celebrate everything that makes you uniquely you. Your mind is your space, you carry home with you everywhere you go. You don't have to judge yourself the way that others do. You can appreciate yourself and be at peace ‚ù§Ô∏è

1cqr8hp,"It's not a flex, and please don't think I'm showing off or something ... 

I make friends pretty much anywhere I go and sometimes I feel I've got too many to keep up with. It's not always been this way. I struggled to make friends by the age of 20 as well. The best tips I can offer:

1. Show genuine interests in others. If they share something, ask follow-up questions. ""Oh you got a new phone! How do you like it?"" Or just straight-up ask questions ""where did you grow up, and what was it like?"" PwBPD are sometimes too anxious to show interests in others. Sometimes I notice people with cluster B in general look bored when others talk about themselves. 

People typically don't fall in love with the brightest stars but those that make them comfortable and seen and accepted. 

2. Light teasing and harmless sarcasm to show humour and confidence. It also creates a sense of intimacy quickly. But use it lightly as it can come across insensitive if it doesn't land...
