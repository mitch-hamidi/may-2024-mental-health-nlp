1cvxoh3,Your right. I don’t even know how to describe how absolutely exhausting depression makes me 24/7 365 days a year I truly hope your just burned out because it is a terrible feeling,ArmadilloOk5776,False,1716155523.0
1cvxhdb,"Have you paid the bill yet? If not delay it a week and pay for the therapy session, that takes priority imo. I learned a long time ago to not let bills get an emotional reaction out of me, I pay them when I pay them, the amount I can afford and that’s that. It’s transactional. I take care of me first, my health, my food, the roof over my head, my child’s needs etc all come first. 

As for being verbally shat on by a patron I’m so sorry. I never understand entitled people who think service workers are there for them to simply word vomit on or verbally abuse as they see fit. I go out of my way to acknowledge the human being standing in front of me doing the job, bc I’ve been in the service industry too. It’s freaking hard to smile for pennies on the dollar and pretend you love fixing everyone’s ridiculous issues. 
OP, tomorrow will come soon enough, and then before long it will be Friday and it will be ok. 

My only advice is there isn’t anything that alcohol won’t make worse, so as tempting as it is, getting blotto now won’t fix a thing and will only bring more issues to the week (less money, more hangover, anxiety etc).",Left-Nothing-3519,False,1716151427.0
1cvxhdb,"That's the thing. They will go after you if you don't pay it, even drag you to court. I've already paid for it. I'm gonna see if I can pay on Friday instead. If not, then I'll use my credit card again.... I'm pretty much living off of it at this point",Collector_2012,True,1716160348.0
1cvxhdb,"My experience with credit cards and billing is I tell them I’m getting paid … date and will send payment then. As long as it’s within 30-ish days of payment due date they can’t do anything. They try to put pressure when you are unsure or show insecurity. As for them sending a statement 2 months late, I will pay it within 30 days of receipt. I treat all billing the way any business treats billing / remove the emotions from the equation. It makes it much less stressful. Companies count on people being emotional about this stuff, I’ve been through bankruptcy, I’ve been widowed, I’ve started over with nothing to my name and needing to support a family with no help and no family around to help. 
I promise you that you can do this. Take a breath, take a seat, and take a step back from the emotional reactivity. It’s a numbers game. 
The bills come in, I arrange them by due date and by importance. I give them 30 days to sit and marinate while I take care of daily life. Things like food, health and well-being, shelter come first. The threats of debt collections is noise, they have to follow the same process everyone else does, its 90 days, plus notice after notice, they like to rattle cages and be verbally aggressive but the fact is they can’t force you to do anything if they have only sent you one bill and haven’t given you any other notice. Thats their mistake. You treat the bill that same as any other that has just come through the mail. 
Companies can say lots of things, it’s up to you how you choose to react to them. Just giving you my 30+ years of experience as an average working person who does not let creditors scare me into freaking out. Life’s too short for that.",Left-Nothing-3519,False,1716161552.0
1cvxhdb,I pay my credit card almost weekly. The hospital sent me the bill at the wrong time and I've been hurting financially for it,Collector_2012,True,1716164404.0
1cvxhdb,"Have you called them and asked to speak to someone in the billing department to work out a payment plan? I would start there, if they are not helpful wait a few days and call back. Sometimes it takes a few tries to find the right person.",Left-Nothing-3519,False,1716164519.0
1cvxhdb,Yes. I pay 25 bi weekly. I got maybe 50$ on the bill I gotta pay,Collector_2012,True,1716165855.0

1cvw2ta,"I would suggest first going and reaching out for help. ""Attacking"" / treating mental health ASAP can help with the process of healing 'faster'. I think it really depends on the person in regards to what happens as you get older. I know some people, who have suffered with MH issues during their teen years, have been super sucessful. I think it is also a chemistry thing, something almost flips in your brain and the journey starts. By no means are you going to be waking up one day feeling like you're 'cured', but you will feel it. You don't have to graduate, if school is making your so unhappy, drop out. People who drop out can also be successful, however, that is something that is up to you. People who tend to get help when they are rock bottom low, will have to spend more time trying to get better vs the people who caught onto it sooner. Some people can struggle silently through out their teen years and into their early adult life. They only then reach out when they have hit the bottom of the bottoms, so then their healing journey starts from there.

1cvu4k6,"Hi, I'm sorry you're going through all that. It sounds like too much to take. 

I'm not sure I understand what exactly your mental health problem is from the description. If it's not too triggering, can you describe these hallucinations or the symptoms that are the problem? 

Also I don't know how it works in your country. Can your gp prescribe you medications that would help like Pregabaline or some antidepressants?",AntonioVivaldi7,False,1716143872.0

1cvu4k6,"I see. First, maybe a lower dose of Quetiapine would be better? I was on it for a little while too and had to lower the prescribed dose right away or else I wasn't able to function. 

I'd say I understand anxiety well as I recovered from terrible GAD and OCD. I don't know if you're familiar with how you're supposed to work with it. Do you know exposure therapy? That's what you need to be doing in order to make it better. 

And I'm not sure what to thing of those hallucinations. Usually when people experience hallucinations, they don't question it at all. They take it as if it's really happening. I'm wondering if these are more of visual phenomenons similiar to what I was experiencing at one point. For example seeing a clearly bright smoke when I turned off the lights. Or as if the floor was moving.",AntonioVivaldi7,False,1716144827.0
1cvu4k6,[deleted],,False,1716145263.0
1cvu4k6,"I recently explained it to someone so I can just copy it here:

First, it's important to establish that all anxiety, no matter what it's about, is coming from having low tolerance of uncertainty.

ERP (exposure therapy) is about exposing yourself to your fears on purpose. If you do that, your brain registers there was nothing to be scared of and that will make the fear weaker.

With thoughts it's trickier. Scary thoughts such as intrusive thoughts or simply about how something bad might happen or already happened demand a clear reassurance from you about how it'll be fine. But by seeking this reassurance, you're further lowering your tolerance of uncertainty, making the anxiety worse. That's why you must stay in uncertainty about your fears on purpose and that way slowly become comfortable with it. And a great way to make it easier and shut down the rumination about your fears is acceptance approach. For example if you start thinking something bad might happen, tell yourself it might indeed happen and leave it at that. Add it's fine if it happens. This allows you to adapt a sort of ""whatever"" mindset about fears and your brain will throw that specific worry out and also slowly stop bringing such thoughts on your mind to begin with.

At the same time don't search for how likely or unlikely is it to happen, otherwise this doesn't work.

And overall it's important to not be in your comfort zone too much in terms of avoidance. Meaning don't avoid specific situations, people or triggers in general purely because of anxiety, because that way it the comfort zone shrinks. While getting out of your comfort zone on regular basis expands it, making you more comfortable in general.

Also it's important to keep in mind how because all these fears are coming from the same place, confronting one fear will weaken other fears too, even though they're otherwise not related at all. So it's worth it to be confronting all fears, not just the main one.

And with the feeling of anxiety for no apparent reason, meaning the feeling of dread or doom with no specific trigger, you must not try to make it stop in any way. Also at first it's good to focus on it, as if it's a quiet sound you're trying to hear. This way you will build some resistance to it in just few seconds, making the anxiety from it weaker. Then you should carry on with whatever you were doing, but still not try to make it stop or distract yourself. As if it's something you have to tolerate being with you. This way you keep building resistance to it, which also carries over to the future, making the future attacks weaker and less and less frequent the longer you do this.",AntonioVivaldi7,False,1716146573.0
1cvuf38,"It's ok to be weird and different. I was like the only Asian kid in two of the high schools that I attended. One was in North Dakota where everyone was pretty much just related to each other. I immigrated to the US when I was 6 from South Korea. I always just wanted to be like everyone else. I wanted to have blond hair and blue eyes. I even wanted to dye my hair blond, but we were actually too poor to buy hair color. Anyhow, both high schools that I attended in 9th and 10th grade, one in North Dakota, and another in rural Virginia were totally hick. I mean like all the guys had to take a class called Future Farmers of America or some shit. I felt so out of place. Even if I was normal, there was no way I would have felt normal in these hick schools.

In 10th grade, I attended a different high school in Virginia what wasn't so hick. It was a much larger school. I did my best to fit it. I played sports, so I made some friends that way. There are very few genuine personalities in high school. Everyone just fakes it. But there were a few kids that just didn't give a F. I look back now, and man, I really envy them - to have the maturity at that age to just be who the F they want, and not faking it for anyone else. They weren't trouble makers. They weren't jocks. They weren't popular. But they were just genuine and got along with all cliques.

I'm an artist, and I can't be arsed to have distractions... how much that's a part of my mental illness, I'll leave in the middle

I wouldn't say I date people with a mental illness exclusively, but I found that dating them, helps more to have some understanding, with my own issues, but also avoids arguments about work, money, and such things, because they're likely in the same boat.

That said... I dated mostly women on the autism spectrum; I seem to pick them out, even if some got a diagnosis later in life.

And I'm not exactly getting more calm and such... and I'm quite a loud and confident extrovert,  which doesn't always gel with everyone.

I got pissed off and began going in on him about some shit that happened when I was growing up - He eventually stopped me and said something that I took to heart, ""You know, I haven't thought about that in 20 years. I bet it's been burning your ass every day since it happened.""

He was right; it hurt to hear that, but he was 100% right. I was hurting myself, the entire time, and he was just busy being a shitty person without a care in the world about the things he had done.

It's SUPER IMPORTANT that you learn to let things go. I know that sounds impossible, but therapy can help. CBT/DBT can both help. There are new drug-based therapy methods that are entering trials now that can probably help a lot, but are untested at this time.

She can't remember much as it is, and I know she will never functionally be able to help me cope with my childhood stolen away by neglect.

1cvt9ab,"This is definitely sexual assault because you didn't consent. There is no justification for forcing yourself onto someone else or touching someone without their consent, regardless of whether or not you're intoxicated, lonely, repressed, or the person is a friend.

The following is provided to hopefully give you some insight on what may be going on with your friend. It's not an excuse or justification, nor is it guaranteed to be correct.

Your friend might be really struggling with or questioning his sexuality. Given your description of the community you're in, he may feel like hate himself, everyone would hate him if they knew, he'd lose everyone and everything, he has to smother/kill that part of himself, he's broken/like something's wrong with him, and/or he has to put on a mask and go out of his way to make people think he's straight. 

Feeling that way for so long without support can cause serious depression, anxiety, fear, and other chronic mental health issues. He may have done this to you because, in a drunken state, he felt safe with you and was inhibited enough to drop his facade and make a move.

I want to be 100% crystal clear that this is not an excuse, his behavior is entirely unacceptable, and should be addressed with him. You would be absolutely within your right to go to the police and press charges or end the friendship, if you wanted.

If you want to preserve the friendship and support him, I'd suggest pulling him aside in a private space and having an even-toned discussion with him. Something like:

""Hey man. We need to talk about what happened. First, I want you to know that you're my bro and nothing is going to change that. You can tell me anything, trust me, and know that I want you to be comfortable enough with me to be yourself around me. 

That being said, what happened last night was not ok. I know you were drunk and in your feelings, but it's not ok to touch people without their permission or make them do things they don't want to do. You put me in a really awkward position because you clearly were going through some things and needed some support and I wanted to help you, but you were assaulting me at the same time. I really need you to not do that again.

This isn't because I think you're gay, bi, or anything else. I wouldn't care in the slightest if you were and would be there for you and support you if you were. This is because what happened wasn't right and I want to be able to preserve this friendship.

If you want to talk about this or anything else that's been going on with you, I'm here, man.""",SandSurfSubpoena,False,1716140492.0

1cvt2ua,"I'll be very direct, to save time: think about the situation or context in which you feel afraid, remembering it. Then, keeping this scene superficially on the mental screen, keep your eyes closed and say mentally, referring to yourself, **using emotion in your mental voice and concentrating hard** on each word:

""'Harry"" \[*your own name here*\], **wanting to face this situation** will bring you a lot of courage, a lot of peace, wanting to face this situation will bring you a lot of happiness of victory, it will bring you a lot of personal evolution, it will make you a great person, it will make you feel stronger and more capable, it will bring well-being and help you to be successful, it will make your life more complete, etc. (add as many positive things as you want to strengthen this positive process about facing).""

Then say: ""Harry"" \[*your name*\], **wishing to escape this situation** will bring you distress and disgrace, make you feel very bad and live a horrible life, wishing to escape will destroy your happiness, destroy your peace, etc. ( add as many negative things as you can think of to strengthen the negative idea about running away).

You need to speak as if you were your friend. Without concentration and without emotion it doesn't work.

Sometimes Asian people *are* good at math, students in universities often find foreign exchange students from Asia, often in order to get accepted into a university in america the Asians that do come are highly skilled in multiple areas, and so, the stereotype gets perpetuated. 

Women often do have bad experiences with men. 2 out of three women ages 16-36 reported experiencing at least one form of harassment over their previous year, the statistics (and there’s a lot more of them) kinda make it super understandable why women feel uncomfortable with men. 

Sure, not all men are bad, and women are smart and don’t belong in the kitchen, and black people aren’t vile. But sometimes things occur that reinforce the narrative either accidentally or by unfortunate coincidence. 

Honestly with the stats the way they are, I am shocked women don’t feel even less safe and comfortable around men, but many still want to find a good relationship where they feel safe and cared for. Same for men, and it’s unfortunate, but your feelings of safety and security don’t conform to logic, they are emotions, and emotions for all people are wild and fairly difficult to wrangle, even more-so if you have first-hand trauma and ptsd.

1cvphk6,"I do see your point. It would be better if the question was phrased that way, but the point of it is for the question to be polarizing, not to be politically correct or sensitive to men’s issues.

I can tell this question is harming your emotional well-being and sense of honor and dignity as a man. It’s unfortunate, and it’s unfair, but life isn’t meant to be fortunate and fair. It’s uneven and respect and quality of life, and happiness is inequitably distributed. You are fighting a battle against someone who feels equally or more wronged than yourself likely at the hands of one or many men. And the reason it gained traction is because it’s an emotional outlet for women to converge socially on.

Still, most women choose to seek out romantic and platonic relationships with men. But emotions aren’t logical, and frustration gets worse as it becomes more pent-up.

I’ve personally ditched social media and have been flying solo now except for irl relationships. I am happy, I never see any polarizing and hurt and agressive issues that I hold zero personal responsibility over. It’s liberating, and pretty peaceful. If you are a good man, you should take pride and restfulness in that knowledge, and if these things still bother you, then it’s best to have conversations with people who seek you out to specifically vocalize the emotional content that they feel you would be most reliable, and supportive, and beneficial to approach you with.

People can’t be perfect, you, me, sally who started this trend, etc. we all have our strengths and weaknesses and (*in my opinion*) we should aim to live our lives helping the best way we can. And sometimes that’s by getting ourselves out of the way so people can vent and relieve themselves of the pent up fear and anger and sadness and pain so they stop carrying it with them everywhere they go. While it might not be healthy for men, it’s also something that is healthy for them to release so they can feel better in their day-to-day lives. 🤷‍♂️ I say let it go and try finding greater happiness and peace. It’s really not harming anyone, and men can have their own opportunities to vent and create trends as well that women in turn will hate.",Bassdiagram,False,1716207892.0
1cvphk6,"I'm not trying to be antiman, I am married to a man and have 2 sons, I love men.  But there is NO WAY for women to know which men are dangerous and which are safe without time, information and context. Even if only 10% of men would hurt women given the chance to get away it, those men don't come with like horns on their head or a sign on their chest saying ""misogynist"" ""wife beater"" ""rapist"". To be *safe* we have to be suspicious. When we don't operate from suspicion and get hurt we are told it is our fault for being stupid and trusting. It's just how it is, I'm not trying to be hurtful or unfair.  And the money comment is weird, women make their own money these days. Men are just as capable of gold digging as women and everyone should look out for that.. 🤷‍♀️",Danaregina220,False,1716210460.0
1cvphk6,"but this is not a hypothetical where there are odds, so it is either 100% visiting a bear, or 100% visiting a man. so i suppose we’re both right, you’re just thinking at the question not in the way it was intended. doesn’t matter either way, i won’t complain if a girl wants to cuddle the friend-shaped murder machine",Rayan_qc,False,1716154116.0
1cvphk6,"Yes I get that.I am happy for you and wish you the best.

Maybe its just me but I give people chances. I have really bad experiences with black people(they wanted to rob me and told me they would kill me)  but I still have a black friends. If under your logic people should live in fear then should we treat black people diffrently just because they commit more crime then others? Or should arabs be treated  as terorists until proven othewise?

I get your point and SA it is worse then death. R\*pists should have  life sentence in prison but living in fear in general isnt living.

My point is to not be scared of men unless its some weird situation even woman can be scary in some situations.

And to your point about gold digging it is true but there are more gold diggers woman than men. Same as there are mor men r\*pists so everyone should look out for that too right?",Healthy_Quiet77,True,1716211469.0

1cvl7au,"I think you where emotionally abused, I suspect by a parent (or caregiver). You stop trusting your intuition. It's NOT your fault your like this. In fact I'm certain that your childhood did this. It always leads back to childhood. I am reminded of my old self when I read your comments, it feels very familiar.

The book I recommended earlier, will help alot. It's very big but just read what speaks to you. It doesn't have to be read front to back. It'll provide so much fundamental insight.

I think you haven't fully explored your past due to how painful it is. I did ketamine for a bit and did some digging into my past, it really helps. Unfortunately you may abuse it like I did, but once the initial sting of realisation passes you'll want to control the use of substance. You'll care for yourself more. You think you've uncovered everything but memories come back and bite, trust me if your feeling this way there's more to find.

You are out of tune with intuition. It's how toxic parents and  get ya. As long as your out of touch you'll always come back, you'll always be under their thumb. Malevolent people sense this and now you have a whole new beast that your friends with and you have no idea about their dark intentions. You can escape this cycle, but it's an ongoing process. It gets easier the further you get. Your mind will provide the tools you need once you reconnect with your past (understand it deeply).

Finding a spiritual belief system is super helpful in orienting yourself in life. I personally use a mix of Christianity and Hermeticism. Right now you may not believe in that stuff, but we have worshipped as humans for millions of years so it's in our DNA and is sure to make you feel better. Hermeticism worships nature, I believe it's the purest form of religion out there. It doesn't pretend to have all the answers which I like. It's more realistic without falling into nihilism.

1cvkya0,"Your fears are actually pretty valid and you will definitely experience these things again at some point in your life. Yes, everyone is susceptible to lying, cheating, abandoning, hurting, and a multitude of other things. And as much as I'd like to claim that I'm above such things, it's simply in our nature and none of us really are.

That said, it's not the fears themselves that should be treated as the issue, rather it should be how you react to them. It's understandable that you don't want to get hurt, but if you're always protecting yourself from pain, you leave no time to feel joy and all you'll ever feel is pain.

I think that you should try to come to terms with the fact that anyone might do you wrong at any moment and that you, regardless of what happens, are going to be all right.

The last part of that is what's important: you're going to be all right. You are allowed to not dwell on these things. If someone hurts you, then they either care enough about you to talk it out or they aren't worth your time. If it ends up being the latter, then what worth is it to you to spend your time worrying about what they did?

I think that what I'm trying to say, in a rather roundabout way, is: stop protecting yourself and start caring for yourself instead. Pain is inevitable, but not eternal. You'll be all right, if only you allow yourself to.",VivaLaPlutoFudgeYou,False,1716114841.0

1cvitv7,"Being 14 is a really weird age in life. It sucks and every aspect of your life feels like it sucks. First off as a recovering self harm addict whose been doing it since I was 14 and whose now 20. Stop. You will live past the age you are now and will regret the things you’ve done to yourself. Self mutating does nothing but make things worse with ur family, friends, school etc. . Being lgbt as a minor also sucks but honestly you don’t have to date right now I know it feels nice to have someone but I promise you having a boyfriend isn’t going to fix all ur problems if anything depending on whose your boyfriend at 14 it might just make your life worse. Any relationship I’ve had or anyone else I’ve known at 14 was always ridiculously toxic. And for your parents they will come around you just have to give it time and if not FUCK THEM your parents do not determine what the kind of person you want to be. You might not be able to do what you want right now but you WILL. Life isn’t all sunshine and rainbows when you’re an adult but you’re able to make conscious decisions for yourself and honestly that’s the best part of adulthood. 
My advice to you is to pick up a hobby and stop trying to find a lover. You’re so young and still trying to figure it out. Spend time with yourself, love yourself, get to know you.

1cvhjdy,"Yes, sensory issues are related to ADHD and anxiety. Generally ADHD has connections to people having anxiety and depression. What you are talking about with the vacuum sound, and going out in public space and loud noises is what is called ""sensory overload"". People who neurodivergent have a harder time filtering their senses. We have 5 main types of sensory: touch, taste, smell, sound, visual and taste. For ""normal"" people, they are able to filter out the background distractions. For example, the sound of buzzing, or people talking in the background, whispering etc. However, for people who are neurodivergent, they have over or under sensitivity. That means that people could need more touch (like fidgets) to remain calm and 'organise' their brain. However, for you, it sounds like you're hyperaware of sounds and visual things. Which is completely normal part of having anxiety and other diagnoses. Different people have different triggers. For some, they don't mind loud sounds, but they can't have too crunchy of food. However, some other people can't stand loud noises and they love crunchy food but not mushy food. Everyones brains are hardwired differently. 

For you, it seems to be visual and auditory sensitivity. Often being in places for too long with those triggers end up having emotional breakdowns, and sensory overload and need time aware in a place away from their triggers. It can also mean that people who spend all day in that kind of enviroment come home and feel like they are just so tired from being out. Often people are also masking while they are out which means they also become more tired. This is called burn out (I can make another comment about that with more information about that if you need)

I am also sensitive to loud noises and just overall a lot happening around me. Some things that I have found helpful (again, this varies for people) I wear noise cancelling headphones when I go out and sometimes even just in my house. I use the Bose QC45 and AirPod pros, they both play music (which I find very relaxing for my anxiety) and have amazing noise cancelation. If you want to block out everyone and everything, playing music will do that. However, if you are wanting to go out with someone and still be able to hear them, and not just everything else, then not having music but the noise cancellation on can be enough for that. There are also Loop Ear buds that are really popular, they are a lot more discrete than wearing headphones and you can get them in different 'levels' of noise cancelation. Blocking out all that extra noise means that you can be out in the world for longer periods of time. It also helps with the visual overload because you aren't darting your eyes around to every sound that you hear. Other ways would be learning breathing techniques (I know, very cringy as everyone says that) but it can be really helpful. Bringing fidgets along to can keep your hands busy (I tend to pick my skin a lot when I'm anxious). 

When you come back from being out, you feel super tired from all the sensory input you have got. I have a weighted blanket, and I LOVE it. It helps me sleep longer and fall asleep faster (a major issue I had) it is also really helpful for when I come home from long busy days out and just want to calm down.

I hope this helps you!",GuppyTheGalactic,False,1716099999.0

1cvd932,"Talking to your family is rough, but it's one step forward into getting help. 

It sounds like you have had a lot of things happening in your life I can definitely see how this could be affecting you. I'm not sure how you got diagnosed with ADHD, whether it was through a doctor or a psychiatrist or something else. However, I think that the way that you got diagnosed with ADHD could be a good start into reaching out for help. You can tell your parents that you don't feel well and need to go see a doctor. You can make up whatever excuse, you can then ask to talk to the doctor yourself and discuss your concerns. 

This next suggestion is something some people have found helpful and sometimes not. This would be talking to the school counsellor (or a teacher / staff member that you trust). You can talk to them about your eating habits and other issues you've been having. However, they may have to break confidentiality about your eating if it's getting to an unhealthy point. You could also talk to the school counsellor / staff members about not knowing how to tell your parents that you need help, they can help with that. You can make a plan together as to what to say, and your school counsellor can help give them resources or a referral to a adolescent mental health team. 

Generally the referral would lead to CAMHS (child adolescent mental health service) some have found helpful, some not, it just depends. I personally have gone through the system (however it varies on place to place) and it has been really helpful. They have dieticians, people who specialise in ED's and etc. This is also a good way to get your parents into the loop, I know it sound scary but your parents are an important role into improving your mental health. It is defiantly rough for a little bit, but it gets better. The therapists can meet with your parents to give them advice on how to help you and such. Like you said in your post, therapists don't always gel with their clients. You are always able to say that you aren't a good fit with your therapist and that you would like another one. It is your right to do that, I know it sounds scary, but it won't be their first time that a client hasn't gelled with them. 

With regards to missing school, I feel you. I have missed so much school due to my mental health. I now am doing part time schooling and slowly but surely spending more time at school. This is something that all schools are able to provide (however, I know it can be quite the push to get them to listen) but it has been really helpful for me. It gets rid of the stress of having to be at school when you don't feel like you can mentally do it. You take less class's, less time at school, and other accomodations for your mental health can be added. 

I hope this helps! You are welcome to dm me to talk or what more information. I have been in the similar situation as you and I understand what you are going through. You can do it, and I believe in you. Best of luck xx",GuppyTheGalactic,False,1716099141.0

So whenever I had those 3 class's, I was at school. When I didn't have class's allocated during that period, I wasn't at school. This was I didn't have a full caseload of class's and only had to focus on a specfic amount of class's. So then I wasn't missing time in other class's too.

1cvh1i9,"If you think she is a danger to herself or others (this includes her kids and family members) then you can call the police for a welfare check and explain that. If you do know her therapist, you can also send them an email / request to meet with them to discuss your sister (this depends on the therapist and things like that). I understand that she might put up a mask with her therapist as it's really common. Is this a new therapist? Generally people who mask infront of their therapist, they may not 100% trust their therapist, and feel uncomfy. However, I do understand that trust takes time, and this could be another factor of her putting up her barrier. 

I think that the best way to go though this is either sit down as a family, and discuss your concerns with her. Otherwise, like I said above. you (or your family) can meet with her therapist and discuss your concerns around her bipolar. However, therapists aren't able to diagnose bipolar disorder, only psychiatrists can. However, the therapist maybe able to send a referral to someone who can diagnose her and give her opinion on what she thinks. Or you can mix the two together and meet with your sister, therapist and you (or/and your family) together to discuss the concerns. Kind of life family therapy.

1cvfy4x,"If you are at risk to yourself or others, please do reach out to your emergency number or a helpline of some sort. 

I would suggest trying to talk to a therapist about it, and a psychiatrist can help with medication. Another way to go about this would be admitting yourself to the hospital and explain what is happening. You would be able to get medicated, get diagnosis and help. However, I am aware that some ED's will throw you out and call you attention seeking (trust me, you aren't and no one is attention seeking). Some psych wards aren't great, however they are some good ones. I have been to good and bad ones. But I think that either way, you are still going to get help.

Or you can watch guided meditation videos on YouTube which will also comfort you. Repeat positive affirmations to yourself and tell yourself that everything is temporary.

My advice: Don't go looking for a definition of what wrong with you. Do some self reflecting instead, you're the only one that knows you truly. Think about the why's. Try to find the root cause of why you feel the way you do now, and work to improve it. Remind yourself that we all go through it, and you need to let go of baggage from time to time.

Something that I have found really helpful is typing / writing it out. Sometimes it's late at night and I have a lot on my mind, I'll type it on a locked note, and I just feel more calm. I have done the same thing with my therapist, I wrote out a 5 page note about all the things that I had been going through because I simply couldn't verbalise it. It was the only way I knew how to get help because I needed it, I  just wasn't able to voice how I felt. I also often will text my mum about what's going on. It's an unspoken rule we have. If I text her something, she texts back and won't confront me about me. A lot of people find writing / typing things out easier because they have time to think and process what they are going to say and they feel as though it's a lot less confronting (which I find). 

I think that you should try and write a letter, text or even email to your family / friends. You don't have to tell them everything, you can tell some people more then others, or even just a little bit of information is a step forward for you. It's really scary, you don't have to tell them everything at one go, just step by step.

1cvbjx9,"I understand that, I get go through the same thing. I can feel fine for a bit and then all of a sudden I'm back to being really low. Sometimes when we do too much during the periods where I feel okay, it lead to a lower burn out. For example. if we consider out energy as a battery, and on a good day you have 70% battery, you think to yourself (I feel fine today, I'm gonna do this, and this and this) and by the end of the day, you're at 5%. However, it takes longer to charge up your battery, vs using your battery. You then used do much of your battery over the course of a day or maybe a few days that it takes you a long time to recharge your battery. During that charging period, you don't have enough battery to do the everyday ""chores"" like getting up, brushing your teeth etc. However, not keeping good enough care of yourself, also then drains your battery, so you are stuck in a cycle where you're low on battery, don't want to get up and do anything because it all feels like a chore, but then not doing it makes your battery go lower (aka makes you feel worse) and then it cycles. 

Something that I have found helpful with dealing with it, is simply not doing too much during the better days. When you wake up and you feel like you're doing ""fine"" and having a ""better day"" think about what percentage you're at. Maybe you wake up at 50%, think about the things that make you feel good (shower, go for a walk etc) but also acknowledge and think to yourself, how much of doing xyz is going to take out of your battery. You only have so much percentage in a day, set yourself a limit. Maybe stop and have some down time when your batter gets to 30% and wait to ""recharge"" until you feel better. Even if that means you don't do anything else for the day, you still get something accomplished and you hopefully charge up your battery for the next day you have enough battery to do other things. 

Overall, don't over work youself to the point that your battery gets too low. I know sometimes new stressors come into our lives unexpectedly and that drains our battery more. That's okay, everyone has that and you aren't alone in it. However, knowing that the smallest tasks like taking a shower makes your battery charge up and makes you feel better, just try and do it on the harder days. Don't let your battery percentage get too low. I know it's hard, but even just getting up and taking a shower is a huge win for yourself. 

I believe in you, and you can do it. It might be hard to do at first, but you can do it!",GuppyTheGalactic,False,1716079435.0
1cv5m99,"sounds like you’re going through a really tough and complicated situation. Navigating such deeply rooted differences, especially around beliefs and family expectations, is incredibly challenging,it seems like you both genuinely care about each other, but the pressure from her family's expectations and your core beliefs being in conflict is understandably creating a lot of stress. It’s important to stay true to yourself and your beliefs, but it’s also clear how much you care about her well-being, but I feel like you see this relationship as a burden in your life, I just think you have to think for yourself too and not please her family members or her. 
As for your relationship, it might help to take a step back and focus on her immediate wellbeing first. her safety is the most important thing right now. If you can, try to maintain communication and gently encourage her to talk to a mental health professional.

She also always asks me what I want, about maintaining or cutting off communication, independent of her feelings, while the truth probably is that I would probably want to cut contact for now, to start getting past it. But obviously because of how she feels I would want to keep in contact, but I think somehow me wanting to get past it, and deep down wanting to cut contact for myself, makes her feel like I don't care about her, cause i want to get over her.",No-Plastic-2286,True,1716119978.0

It's clear that this cycle of hurt and regret is taking a toll on both of you.it’s important to prioritize your own wellbeing, and it sounds like taking a break from communication might be what you need right now to start healing. It’s not that you don’t care about her rather, it’s about taking the necessary steps to take care of yourself.you might want to explain to her that this break isn’t about a lack of caring but about giving yourself the space to move forward in a healthy way. It’s a difficult decision, but sometimes stepping back is the best way to gain clarity and protect your own emotional health, don’t sacrifice yourself for her tho i can tell that it's getting pretty overwhelming for you",Express-Difference65,False,1716120434.0

They are volunteers and sometimes (depending on the helpline and time) you can talk to people who also have had their own battles with MH. These services are also free!",GuppyTheGalactic,False,1716078528.0
1cv65qc,"Yep. This is actually a universal experience, I also have this. I can have periods of my life, maybe a week or so, where I think life is great, and I hang out with friends but I'm not ""manic"" I'm simply a ""normal"" person enjoying life with minimal amounts of stress and worries. Then however, overnight I can go allt he way back down to the bottom and just want to lay in bed and not feel like anything. Often this is due to added stressors in my life, or simply just burn out. Burn out can be from doing too much in the ""good week"" and not having enough time to decompress and recharge your battery. Because of this, you drain all your battery so low without the opportunity to recharge your batter that it takes longer to recharge it from 0%. 

&#x200B;

A way that has helped me with this is not over doing it during the ""good days"". Don't do everything and anything when you feel good (even though you might want to) because it leads to burn out and then again, the cycle goes where you then just need to recharge. It's kinda like making sure your phone doesn't go all the way down to 0%, instead you try charge it till it gets to 50% or 80% and take it off the charge, use it and then recharge it before it gets too low on battery. 

&#x200B;

In my opinion, since she's grown up with these thought patterns for so long, it may unfortunately be a part of her reality for a long time. I think she needs to get to the point where she sees the damage she is making to herself and her loved ones. She is way too old to be acting this way, and if there's anything you can do to show her that her behaviour comes with real consequences, you might be able to get through to her",XanthicXylophone,False,1716061639.0

The world is cruel sometimes, the bad people are the ones who have a good sleep at night. But there's always a place to go, there's always a song to listen, there's always a movie that can make you cry, that can make you free from painful feelings.

1cv3236,"You know what normal actually is these days? ""Normal"" is just one of few personalities born of the internet. So many people have no original thought or personality. They just think and believe what the internet tells them to.

But hey, if you want to be normal so bad you do have some choices...

You could be someone who thinks 80% of the men you encounter are dangerous and out to get you and not realize that its a phobia and that most of the men are actually decent guys who are trying to live their life like you.

How about following one of the ""rolemodels"" who would have you believe that most modern day women are shameful and should be secluded to their homes and subservient to men and focused on providing them with children.

Maaaaybe you'd prefer to be ""woke"" or a conspiracy theorist. There's some truth in those types but there's also so much crazy delusion mixed in that you'll never figure out what is true.

You could be gay and leave the rest of your personality in the closet. Then build your entire life in a way that ensures your sexual orientation is all people will ever think of when you're in their life.

You could quit your job and become a sex worker on OnlyFans. (Honestly I've been considering this myself but thats just because I fkn hate my job).

I hear being afraid of change and rejecting all inconvenient truths is popular amongst old people. It must be pretty fun making sure everyone knows just how much bs modern science is.


I could keep going but I think you understand.
You really don't want to be normal and being different is a good thing! Embrace your uniqueness, weird traits, and eccentricities. Take pride in the fact that you are different. A lot of people won't vibe with you but the ones that do will be the best people you'll ever know!

1cv1l2z,"how early in your early twentys were you? when youre in your early twenties it can feel like your still a teen yourself. and when youre a teen you freely think about teens in a sexual way bc you yourself are a teen and feel sexual so you dont see the wrongness in it (bc there is none if you’re  a teen feeling sexual about other teens) but then you get a little older and realize how mentally and physically undeveloped a teen is compared to an adult and how wrong it is for you to think of them that way. 

idk what you meant by “minors” but if you meant like a kid that could be in highschool i dont think this brings you to a “pedo” level. (or even the technically correct name of whatever the group is thats attracted to post-puberty teen) 

from the age of 18-20 you go from being a person who is freely allowed to think about romance and sex in a “teen” capacity to all teens being taboo and forbidden. lots of people deal with a stunted emotional and maturity development due to screens and home environment. its not so crazy to be a 21-23 year old who sometimes finds themselves thinking about a 15-17 year old. I AM NOT CONDONING SEXUAL ACTS WITH A MINOR. im just saying it doesnt make you a bad person for simply having those thoughts. theres no magic switch that gets flipped at 18 or 20 that desexualizes anyone younger. 

if you were fantasizing about younger kids? well i guess it depends on the nature of your fantasy. were you trying to actively think about an adult man/woman and your brain kept taking you to a more taboo scenario with a younger kid..did you immediately feel disgust and shame when that happened and try to pivot away? 

the more taboo the more exciting the more our brain tries to chase that feeling. im not justifying it im just saying theres a difference between someone whos sexually attracted to kids and someone who falls into a brain loop of the taboo scenario. you can go from fantasizing about a cute highschooler in a cheer skirt( IN YOUR EARLY TWENTIES WHEN YOU FEEL YOUNG AND LIKE SHES BASICALLY YOUR PEER) to a younger kid. 

BUT in my experience there is no thrill in fully rolling out the taboo scenario. when i was going through this i saw that door opening and immediately slammed it shut because it creeped me out and i didnt feel a “desire” to pursue it. do you feel a desire?

one thing i definitely noticed for me was that when i was around an actual child? these thoughts never occured. i never got sexually turned on by seeing a real life child it was the taboo of the “daddy” kink that broke me. is that you? teach your mind to see the boundary between roleplay and reality. 

the fact that you havent had these thoughts and now just look back with shame tells me you probably didnt and dont. you were young and likely selfish and your world was only you. pray if you need to pray. give if you need to give. forgive yourself for crossing a line younger you never thought was possible. journal and cry and scream and then burn the paper. let what was be and move forward. 

you never touched a kid and even if it feels like apart of your soul will always be blackened because of this, the fact that you never brought these dark thoughts to realization is crucial. it is what saves you. we all have demons in our heads.

1cv28rz,"You right. The truth of the matter is no one cares, or they begin to care less overtime if the issue stems from your mental health. 

My take: every person walking down the street is ""crazy"" in one way or another. Everyone is dealing with something or many things to a certain degree and becomes debilitated to a certain degree because of it. There is a very apparent stigma that still exists in the mental health world, and people would rather hide what they go through forever, than admit it to themselves or anyone else. Lots of factors like pride, shame, guilt, hypocrisy, denial, or just general lack of awareness. This stigma will hang on for dear life until the boomer gen has passed and the gen behind them as well.

I flunked out of college over mental health and not taking care of it. Went from straight A's and perfect attendance, to straight never going to class, never eating, and sleeping everyday for almost a whole semester, a complete shutdown. The shame/guilt over that took almost 8 years to process out of my thick skull. The things we can go through are undeniable and much more debilitating than back pain for a temporary amount of time.

My advice is to never expect anything out of the world around you, because at best, you'll be severely disappointed out how cruel and lacking in compassion everyone is. The best you can do is be good to yourself, period. Never stop working to improve yourself, your mentality, and your quality of life. The world doesn't care, but you can.

Not the reality of the world, so it’s something I have to be mindful of and work to improve on. Little things add up, and before you know it, you’ve become negative or pessimistic in general.

I could be totally wrong, so I'm sorry if I am, but here is what advice I'd offer. if you already do these things, just ignore me. :) and maybe try couples therapy. having a mediator is amazing, and it's not all crying and vulnerability, sometimes it's fun.

when you have a calm, neutral moment, tell her that it upsets you that the only time she seems to remember not to do things that hurt you is when you say it. tell her the things she does that hurt you, and ask her if it would help her if you calmly pointed them out when she does them. let her know that you don't think she's evil, but that she may not realize how often she upsets you. it may seem like common sense to you, but your brains don't work in the same way, you don't have the same thoughts and emotions. I know it's frustrating, but I find reminding myself of that really helps me deal with others. remind her that you are a human and that we all need love and support, and let her know how she could show that to you.

ask her to communicate the same to you-what things you do hurt her and why. ask her to gently remind you when you do those things, and not to assume you know every time because, like I said, you have different brains, different thought patterns, different emotions. ask her if it is really the games that bother her, or if it's your behavior outside of that too. sometimes, people pick one thing to freak out over, when what really bothers them is plenty of other smaller things. if she felt loved and supported otherwise, she would have no problem with you gaming.

remind each other of the things you love about each other. remind each other why you put effort into the relationship. remind each other regularly. communicate to each other ways that you would like to be reminded. :)

easier said than done! I know whenever I have big conversations like that with my partner we usually end up crying, but it feels so much better afterward. communication should be strong, not just bare bones. try to process your anger before talking to her, and not during. you should express that you're upset, but getting heated isn't going to be helpful there.

as for her substance abuse, let her know that it concerns you and that you're ready to help when she's ready to stop. this is a whole other issue, and even though I've dealt with a lot of addicts in my life, I feel very ill equipped to offer advice more than that.

1cuz6uf,"I just watched a video about how some old human fossils were found that suggested that skilled surgery was used to treat an injury. The story was that the ancients may have been more crafty than we realized, but what I found more striking is that there was a community that cared for an individual enough to amputate a limb, help them recover, and thrive for years. 

No medical system, no office job, just some wild humans caring for each other. Perhaps the system we live in, the world we’ve built, has gone astray from our core human-ness. I think we are naturally caring about others - to a degree - but the world has twisted us into something else. 

Where I live, everything is a commodity. Even hobbies for fun are supposed to earn money. When we can’t even enjoy ourselves without having to earn money, that can make people sad, angry, anxious, or desperate. It can lead to competitive behaviors instead of communal ones. And caring gets lost as we devalue people who maybe aren’t able to be productive. 

The ancient humans didn’t care about productivity so much. They just cared for each other. I’m not sure how we get back to those roots other than to fight against the system and form our own communities. Which may be harder for some than others. I’m able bodied, but my mind is not in a good place. I’m fortunate to have some really good friends, but even they cannot break my mind of it’s depression. Because they are caught in their own trap. 

What I know is this: there are small pockets of people out there, fighting for a tiny piece of community. Urban gardens, book shops with readings, LGBTQ organizations trying to foster support and care. Small bands of misfits roaming around trying to form community in a world that is built to destroy it. 

We are all worthless in this system the moment we don’t serve a purpose. And that’s going to make everyone crazy. Cause irrational behavior and wild, contradictory thoughts.

I went to a small, regional school, and I had to take out student loans and work two jobs. I was in a fraternity, and a lot of my fraternity brothers came from families with money. Their parents not only paid for room and board, but also gave them money. I would often come to a party after closing up at a sub-shop (making sandwiches) smelling like food, and they would make fun of me. Everyone would already be drunk. I was tired, but I wanted to hang out. 

I didn't go to any ivy, but my hard work paid off. I have a home in a coastal town in Southern California, considered affluent. My wife has had the luxury of being a stay-at-home mom for 15 years. I've had flexible jobs with little or no commutes to spend a lot of time with my family. Sometimes I feel like I could have done more with my life financially if I sacrificed my time with the family, but I don't regret my decisions. 

I didn't have any close friends outside of the fraternity circle. I mostly hooked up with sorority girls. I didn't really date because I had no money. Although my fraternity brothers made fun of me, there was still love. They understood my situation, and it was half-jokingly. But it still kind of hurt knowing that they probably thought that they were better than me because I was a service worker. I don't really keep in touch with them anymore. Most of them still live where they grew up, either got mediocre jobs or are working in their family business.",cahrens2,False,1716043699.0

1cuy5ww,"No. What you’re describing is a cognitive distortion called personalization, thinking everything is your fault. But it’s rooted in a negative sense of self. Thinking things are your fault. Thinking you’re always messing up. Thinking you’re the root of all evil in the world (not literally). 

You are right in acknowledging that narcissists think everything is about them, but the key here is a sense of self grandeur. Narcissistic think everyone thinks about them the same way they think about themselves: superior. That sense of self importance has to be paired with the inflated sense of self in order to qualify as a narcissistic trait. 

So you thinking “i must be a narcissist because when people are hurt I think it’s my fault” is the exact tell to know that you’re not. A narcissist would see someone hurt and not even consider that it was their fault because in their minds they can do no wrong.

1cuxl1a,"About your guilt: You need to see the positive side of how you see error, of what it means to make a mistake. Error is not something to be hated. When it occurs naturally, it is a blessing in our lives because it means that our consciousness has had to adjust to learn something new that it didn't know before. It makes us better! Therefore, enjoy making mistakes more and be happy when you benefit from it. Forgive yourself. Don't carry guilt. You did the best your previous consciousness could. You don't need anyone to forgive you. Never want that. Never. Some will never forgive you as not everyone is a mature person. Therefore, never be hostage to the need for others to forgive you. This will bring you no benefit or peace. Instead, forgive yourself!

About your shame: It's one thing to realize that you're destroying your own world (your relationships, your friendships, etc.), and then to realize that you made a mistake, feel a little guilty, forgive yourself and move on.

Another thing, completely different, is shame (it has nothing to do with realizing your mistake. It serves no purpose. It hinders you). It reveals that you are wanting to be accepted and well-regarded by people in society, even if unconsciously. However, wanting this makes you a slave. Don't try to be someone else to please society, because that, at one time or another, will destroy your path, which is unique. If you ignore your personal destiny, you will live a life of pure dissatisfaction, a life of pure suffering, where there is nothing but rottenness and affliction of spirit.

Your path is to form a positive version of yourself, a version that delivers more purpose and happiness in your life. And it is not possible to reconcile this with society. You can't do this by wanting to fit into society, because in society there are also many people who are following their own unique paths, and you could never assume such different identities on different occasions to please them.

People need to understand and accept your unique path, your originality, no matter what it is. If they don't accept it, this will be a nuisance that they will have to seek psychological help to deal with. It's not your problem. What is not in your control you should not worry about. Be happy if you ever see that they are uncomfortable. This in a way gives them self-knowledge for themselves, like a gift that you give when you live.

There will be times, perhaps, when you feel embarrassed when you see a pretty girl. You want to impress her, and shame signals that you want to simulate a different and pleasant personality to her, to be accepted. This is another human error. If you do this, she will meet someone else, not you. You probably won't be together for long since she's never met you. In this specific case, you need to think like this: ""Want her to adapt to you. Want her to seek acceptance by you. This way you will maintain your own individuality. If you think like this, you will be doing the right thing. If she is intelligent, she will adapt to you being herself.",-ZaneTruesdale-,False,1716045222.0

Tell them that human existence cannot be reduced to objective factors; humans are far too complex, emotions and relationships exist and the subjective factors are as important as everything (seemingly) objective.

1cuvw8g,"I’m sorry to hear this. There is a lot of emotional abuse from your mother to you. It’s good that you have a therapist to work through this with.

Sometimes there are other things that make you more susceptible to weight gain. 

You can definitely work on these things to help. I’m sure if you asked others you’ll find them to have positive remarks.",,False,1716034814.0
1cuvw8g,"First of all, I’m glad you’ve got access to medication for your ADHD that is supporting you with your studies. Appetite loss is extremely common when experiencing ADHD, and medication often makes this even worse for people.

If it’s a possibility, it may be worth seeing a doctor to get some basic blood tests done to test your nutrient levels and your heart. The physical sensations you described are all very common when your body is deprived of food for long periods of time- regardless of the intent behind restriction.

You’re right on being concerned about how your past and the relationship with your mum may impact your food intake and weight… that is a huge risk factor in developing an eating disorder.

As someone who had a severe eating disorder for almost a decade, I want to urge you to get some support as soon as you can. The longer you let this go on for, the more it will ruin your life and the harder recovery will be. Early intervention is the key to success and the literature backs this up!

You may find it helpful to see a dietician or nutritionist who is able to work with you on slowly increasing your food intake, whilst also working in with your other neurodiverse challenges that may make eating extra hard for you. 

I would encourage you to increase your food intake slowly- not only will this help you tolerate the feeling of fullness better, but if you go from not eating anything to eating lots really quickly, you are at an increased risk of refeeding syndrome and/pr electrolyte abnormalities.

I also wanted to flag that once you do start eating more, it is very normal to find that you become ravenous and want to eat lots. That’s your body’s way of protecting you as it’s not sure when it will get the chance to eat again (it thinks you’re in a famine and will take any chance to eat whilst it ‘can’). Listen to your body as much as you can- it knows how to heal itself, and it knows what weight you function best at.

Finally a few of recommendations to leave you with- 1. Chuck out the scales, 2. Set reminders on your phone to eat throughout the day, 3. You may find it helpful to eat foods that are high in calories, as you don’t need to eat as much volume to get all of the nutrients you need, 4. Please reach out for extra support if/when you need it- I can’t stress to you enough how important it is to address this as soon as you can.

I have a phobia of needles so a blood test is terrifying to me but it’s getting to the point I have is making me question putting that aside, asking a friend to hold me down (like my mother normally does) to get it done. I have started taking vitamins to get my iron up because of the little I’m eating so when I snack I’m getting more nutrients than I used to :)

I think my mum has heavily impacted my relationship with food in ways I’ve spoken to her about but she’s never acknowledged. Even when she said I lost weight I still felt frustrated y’know. 

Thanks for all your tips and reading despite your past with eating disorders, it is a reason I’m concerned to talk to friends about it (most if not all of them have a history of being sectioned for ED or have had severe cases with it).

1cuu502,"Craving junk when you're hungry is most likely because you're not eating enough calories or nutrients. 

Your body is in need of a quick energy, which you can often times find in foods that are high in carbs, fat and sugar, which most times junk food is. 

Depending on the type of junk food, it could indicate that your body is lacking in a certain nutrients (e.g. bread = carbs (quick energy), greasey food = fat (need more long lasting cals), chocolate = sugar (low blood sugar), salty food = low salt (can lead to dehydration)).

If you want to stop craving junk all the time, you need to eat nutritionally balanced meals, ensuring that you're eating enough calories without top high of a surplus (unless needed for weight gain). Don't stop eating junk altogether cold turkey, it can lead to a binge and restrict cycle. It's best to lower it over time, and cut it out eventually (if you wish to reach that point).",Fancypotato1995,False,1716032130.0
1cuu502,"If you've got poor mental health, or your under stress, you'll desire junk food because it's usually quite flavoursome and it makes you feel somewhat good.

The only way to beat that cycle is self help. Don't buy junk food at all, remove the temptation. If it helps, you can experiment with new recipies to take your mind of stress. 

Your body needs nutrients and vitamins and balance. Try and have balanced meals with Fruits, Vegetables, Meats, Carbs. If you fancy a snack, try stuff like fruits or yoghurts.  But if you've eaten junk food for a prolonged period, you might have stomach issues because your body won't be used to the sudden influx of vitamins and nutrients, it won't last too long.

If you can make it past all that, you should be able to kick the habbit. Hope this helps.",BlueKnight0604,False,1716045736.0

1cus4e3,"I get where you're coming from my friend, i too get very angry when driving. I think it's the nature of the act itself, you are confined to the rules of the road inside a moving metal cage while stressing to get to work or wherever. It makes you anxious in it of itself.  Buying a gun to solve this problem, sounds like an exaggeration, though i do not live in a place where people with guns roam about. As long as you are driving according to the laws you are in the right, but also accept the fact that lots of people on the road act like assholes. And not everyone drives perfectly.  Best you can do is protect yourself.   
Try to ignore the ones that bother you and keep at your way. Yelling and lashing out is not a solution and is not benefiting anyone. 

Try to think realistically of the situation everytime you get annoyed. What has really happened? Is it anyones fault?   
How do you avoid this situation next time? In my experience, driving calmly and collected and being clear about your intentions, is the best way to drive, and most people want to avoid conflict as much as you. 

Οn the anger issues, as far as i know, your emotions stem from you. Everyone faces annoying situations on the road. Maybe sit down and think of what actually made you angry at the moment? What is it that you think when someone shows you they think you drive too slow? (Maybe you take some things too personally) Is it really something to be angry about? Is it worth ruining your mood for this?

Recently i felt a very strong attraction to someone and i scuppered it immedietly out of fear of having to show the real me and my real history. feeling awful after that (still stinging in my stomach with the feeling of missed opportunity) i resolved that the only way out of this is to learn to accept the truth of who i am myself, accepting who my family are, and living honestly and truthfully, because at the end of they day, the person who loves you is going to have to love YOU regrdless of your shit... so love won't come until we are open and honest about ourselves to ourselves.

I’m assuming you graduated college? High school? Regardless, congratulations! It’s a lot to go through and a lot of people don’t complete it, myself included. What you are feeling is tough for sure, and hard to understand for a lot of people. The general numbness you’re describing happened to me as well. A couple things you said that I try to touch on briefly. Life goes by fast. The last big birthday is 21, next thing you know, you’re 30 and scratching your head wondering where the time went and it keeps going faster and faster lol. As you become an adult life changes rapidly, you get busy and take on more responsibility and time has a funny way of flying past without you noticing, that’s pretty normal.
Something else, we have very little control over life and it’s many outcomes, don’t stress it. The only thing you have control over is you, your mentality, and your choices, that’s it. Everything else is beyond us and you’ll go mad trying to dictate outcomes and scenarios and the people around you.
Being anxious is also very normal, but most people don’t know how to deal with it long term. My advice is to just be mindful and self reflect often. We become the people we are for very specific reasons. What helped me grow as an individual was thinking about everything that caused me stress in a more analytical way. Ask yourself questions, try to identify scenarios or events that hurt you in the past, identify root causes, improve from there.
I don’t know your family situation. Hard for people to face it, but biological families for A LOT of people can be extremely toxic. It’s not easy to deal with at all. You grow up around these people, and lean on them for advice and support. But there comes a time where even they can be the source of great turmoil that will warp your perspective of yourself and the world around you. If that’s the case, let them go. Life is too short to spend excess energy on people that can’t reciprocate the energy you give them, even if they are blood. That is the toughest lesson to learn, but holds up.

As far as advice on doctors and therapy. Do your diligence to find a good therapist if you have the means. If not, a trusted friend that can be objective and respect your privacy and opinions. Doctors are a sore topic for me so I can’t give good advice on them (15 years of mental health experience from age 13 and on). Some are helpful, a lot are con artists selling meds they don’t understand to people that don’t need them and give you more meds to cope with side affect of previous meds.

You got this, you’re human, this is normal, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Real change comes from within, perspective is key.

1cupfj2,"(Answering to one of your comments) First, SHE lost her dignity, not you. A woman with no dignity has no power on your self esteem. Yes, she might have “robbed” you… but this doesn’t mean she won. She lost a gentle and kind person to get a man who acts like a kid, cause only in elementary school I saw people getting fun of another kid for their appearance. This is a kid thing. No responsible and mature adult would ever do what they did to you. They aren’t mature, they can’t think like proper adult people do, they are useless in your life.

I know you can’t fully hate a person you loved a lot, I know the sensation. But you need to understand that sometimes change is necessary. Also remember there’s a limit to helping someone. You have the right to say no, you have the right to live your happy life and not make another person life happy. Either it’s both or nothing!

I’m not saying you made a mistake, because I think this is an experience a lot of people go through, and of course it’s not your fault if someone is no brained and extremely rude. Just learn from this.. And, no, the lesson is not “everyone will trick me, everyone is rude”.

It will take time but you’ll be able to trust someone again and find another person that’ll make you happy. Believe me when I say this! I experienced it myself. It’s never easy and happy all the time, there surely will be many more rough times for both of us, but life is not made only from bad things!

As another one here said, if you can afford it and if you want to, a therapist would be a great option to recover quickly. And it’s also good to have someone to talk to, have a safe space, since you said you’re scared to go outside.

After you build your new safe space at the therapist, or wherever you want, you can start going to the park, take a short walk, stay active…

If you still don’t feel like going out, you can always refer to an online therapist, there are a lot of apps that allow you to talk by your home with one of them. And they are also cheaper! (But, saying this only for your happiness, this should be a temporary option, then you must go outside.. you can always have an online therapist and another one outside of your house)

One important thing to remember: “…use all of your energy to build your future, not to destroy your past…”

It’ll be okay soon. You’re not alone; you have me, you have all of us, but most importantly, you have yourself. And I honestly don’t think yourself, which is incredibly kind and rare to find in this world, deserves to be judged at a mirror, or by everyone else.

Try everything to keep yourself out of the bed unless it’s time to sleep. You can try to make your bed after you wake up so you won’t want to go on it and ruin it, for example. If you can afford it, and want to, buy some mental health activity books. There are some that do actually help a lot.

If you feel demotivated to do anything, try Finch; it’s a mostly free app that lets you organize your tasks while you grow a little, adorable bird that’s always by your side.

Was this coworker someone he worked with while you’ve been together, or was this before you were together? I think that is important to consider. I would ask him what this woman meant to him and why he felt that it was important to keep a personal belonging to “remember her.”

I’m not sure if you are actually upset about the old letters you found but I think that’s normally acceptable for him to keep, and that it’s not something he should have been expected to disclose to you. It’s entirely possible that he put them in a box and hasn’t thought about them since. Or maybe he’s kept them just for sentimental reasons.

I'm sorry you're frustrated with the providers you've had in the past but in your next provider don't be afraid to voice your frustrations and what you'd like to expect from being under their treatment. It's perfectly ok to have a collaborative discussion with your provider about what what you feel is working and not working under their care. You won't offend them. Often times people say a provider wasn't helpful but never had a discussion with them to properly voice and make their concerns known. Unfortunately, as great as it would be to have the super power of mindreading, mental health providers aren't able to do that. If you're unsatisfied, make it be known.

When that feeling of depression becomes an extended amount of time, typically longer than 2 weeks, is when it may be time to start considering that you're not just down and out but are you suffering from the actual condition of Major Depressive Disorder. Other signs and symptoms can include anhedonia which is just the fancy word for not finding joy or enjoying the things you know you like to do. Loss of concentration, focus, loss or increased appetite, interruptions in sleep like insomnia or hypersomnia, overall depressed mood, feeling irritated or agitated more than normal, fatigue or loss of energy, having thoughts of hopelessness and worthlessness that may include suicidal thoughts whether those are passive (don't contain a plan or intent) or active (includes plan and intent.)

1cul22q,"Depression is a very unique disease, and it especially affects intelligent and competent people in very specific ways. Depression at its core is thinking errors and cognitive distortions.

You are capable of absorbing and processing the world around you, but your only able to view the objective negatives and objective truths. The things you are depressed about are absolutely valid, reasonable and logical, but we tend to get wrapped up in our head thinking about these objective negatives and giving them energy. But as stupid as it seems, you have to look at the positives. Embrace the situations, memories and circumstances that make / made you depressed with curiosity and throw away your preconceived notions and judgements. Stop assuming and creating false realities around the objective negatives, and start to look at the objective positives. Everything will be okay in the end, and if its not okay, its not the end.

Think of each feeling as a rare animal, showing its head in a field of grass, and slowly walking out into the middle of a clearing, where your able to observe this beautiful thing instead of feeling the need to act, shy away from, or ignore. View each thought with curiosity, but do not hold onto or latch onto any of your ideas or thoughts. You are not your thoughts, and you are not your feelings, do not let them define you.

The only meds that will actually cause weight gain are antipsychotics because they change the way your body processes sugar, I’m on seroquel but my psychiatrist prescribed metformin so i wouldn’t gain excessive weight. I’ve heard antidepressants can sometimes be bad for bipolar and can make it much worse so if you’re nervous about that again you could take just the mood stabilizer or an antipsychotic. also from what you described it sounds more like bipolar 2 not bipolar 1, you might want to research the difference. they can be pretty different and people can function okay with it but definitely still struggle a lot, you don’t necessarily have to have gone to a psych ward to have it.

1cukeor,"I was like that too. No, you are not a psychopath. I know this because psychopaths don't think about making posts and don't even have 1% consideration for things.

What happens is that your emotions are very undeveloped. Part of this is lack of practice (having a strong desire to be emotional about things, watching drama films to force yourself to be emotional helps - Be sad, cry with joy, feel sorry, etc., basically being emotional about everything helps you develop. This will improve over months and years training).

Another part of the puzzle is that you suffered a lot and ended up learning that feeling emotion hurts more than it does good, and this closed your heart to protect yourself, possibly from the many traumas of your past.

A third part, which is also about development, is that you need to feel the love. I'm not talking about liking someone, not even falling in love (which anyone can do), but rather a feeling of love. I thought it wasn't possible, but I found a way to start feeling it. However, I don't know if I'm able to describe how to do this, as it's very abstract. However, look at mothers who feel love for their children, as most womans start feeling love when they have a child. 50% of the world's population has never felt love, so don't be surprised when they tell you it doesn't exist.

Either way what happened doesn’t make you a bad person considering you needed to grow up and be resilient so young.

1cukeor,"I'll try to show you the way I felt love for the first time. You'll know you've felt it when it feels like a little stronger liking, like a strange new sensation feeling like a different little pleasure. Then you will perhaps feel the air in your lungs becoming hotter or colder, or you will feel something burning in your chest.

1- Close your eyes, concentrating in silence.  
2- Imagine in your mind the person you like most. It's easier to love who we like.  
3- Imagine her smiling at you. Sympathize with her, empathizing with her smile, as if you feel her joy.  
3- Then, feel as if you want to be inferior to that person (as if you want to feel inferior to that person). This is an extremely important part. You cannot love someone if you cannot feel humble and inferior to them. For the same reason, Jesus washed the disciples' feet, humbling himself. As if you see this person as an innocent child of yours who needs all your care and love. Tell yourself: ""my dear son/daughter"" if necessary. I frequently do this.  
4- Then, decide with conviction, within yourself, that you want to love and feel love for this person. Because the love is a decision! It doesnt happen naturally.  
5- Now, breathe deeply throughout the process, and with each exhale (release of air through the nostrils), you will send love to that person. Intuitively you will have the feeling you are sending, even if in an imaginary way. Feel as if it were possible to send your love to her (just feel as if it were possible, as if you wanted to send your love).

Keep trying until you succeed. The reward will come.",-ZaneTruesdale-,False,1715993403.0

1cuinyr,"It is seriously completely dependent on the two people involved in the therapeutic process - the therapist, and the person. 

I am somebody who has strong perfectionism tendencies, but extremely low esteem, and a poor, distorted self image. I’m judgemental and aggressive often. 

My therapist was a successful woman, who walked a fine line between supportive, and stern with me. She was supportive when I truly couldn’t see my own gifts. She was stern about not enabling me when I would lean into negative self- talk and black and white thinking. 

Overall, she was the type of woman I admired. Strong, objective, and validating. This made me actually listen to her and utilise the therapy skills she would try to teach me. 

If she wasn’t so stern with me, our experience probably would not have been so effective. Different people will have different needs. My issues were complex so the process ranged from one to two years. The results have been transformative. I am a changed person.

People tend to put too big goals in front of them in situations like this and once the motivation fades after a week they fail and fall back even further. Try to set small goals and try to be better just a little bit each day than you were yesterday. 

You can for example put goal to exercise 3 times this week. When this becomes a habit after couple of months proceed to next goal. Dont be impatient it takes time to see results and trust me it will pay off greatly.

Social interactions are also something you can learn, I used to have big anxiety when talking to people or when I went out but over time it got better to the point that I’m often the most confident person in group. This is also just practice. Try reading books maybe or looking at youtube videos.

A good start is to apologize for lashing out on your SO.

It's okay to want to express your feelings without your mind immediately rebutting them. Your emotions are real and important, and it's perfectly normal to seek acknowledgment and validation in the moment, even if they might change later.

Grounding techniques and understanding the root of your thoughts are great tools, but it's also okay if they aren't enough sometimes. You are not the problem; you're experiencing a difficult moment and doing your best to navigate through it.

Be kind to yourself and allow yourself to feel what you feel without judgment. You deserve compassion and understanding, especially from yourself. Remember, it's okay to seek help and support when you need it. You are doing the best you can, and that is more than enough.

1cuh1to,"Aw gosh….yes your suspicion is correct, it’s not normal. It’s very inappropriate. I was hesitant to say this when I read about the underwear checking and clothes smelling, because sometimes that could be chalked up to trying to instil good hygiene into a growing kid… but the lying in bed undressed is totally, completely, unusual and as you found it uncomfortable and said so, it falls into the realm of sexual mistreatment at the very least. 

You have a lot to unpack ahead of you. Many, many parents dance around their children’s boundaries. Trying to figure out their intentions is kind of futile, it’s better to focus on your own feelings and thoughts about it all, and planning to move forward in your life with a different perspective on the experiences you had. 

Also I appreciate that being a young trans person gives you a different dimension of other challenges in your life that most people don’t have. So yeah, lots to process ahead of you.

It sounds like this is something you want to better understand and unfortunately I don’t think anyone here is going to be able to help you better understand why your mom made these choices. What we can all do is reassure you that this is not normal, these are not the actions of a caring parent who respected your personal space.  


When you’re feeling uncomfortable around her, it’s your brain’s way of reminding you that she is not safe to be around. She made poor choices, had poor compulsions and chose actions that made you feel uncomfortable and unsafe. You should add some distance in this relationship- wether that be time (seeing her less, or not at all) or physical distance (such as connecting with her on the phone rather than in person).

1cuh1to,"Everything about this post is weird, down to your name. Wtf? Mom o moaning? I have experienced sexual assault in my own family so I can attest to the effects of grooming, manipulation, and gas lighting minors. You ma'am have been all three and more. There is no way a normal child in their teens would ever think or even consider this abnormal behavior from a parent, okay. She abused you. Mentally, emotionally, and yes...SEXUALLY. Penetration isn't necessary for assault. Forcing you to remove clothes, sniffing your under garments, her removing clothes and rubbing her body on yours in any way, shape, or form IS ABSOLUTELY Sexual in nature. She is gaining some sick gratification off of these experiences just like a pedophile or peeping tom do. I'll give you an example of how bad this is and the early signs.

My niece is 5 years old. I met her when I moved in with my sister when she was mere months old. My sister was hard working and busy all the time at work while her husband took on a stay at home dad role. We'll one day I was baby sitting and was changing my neices diaper when I noticed a odd red spot around her private area. I was like 🤔...But I brushed it off as maybe a diaper rash or my sister or brother in law wiped her too hard. Days go by, maybe weeks, I don't recall. All I know is sister was at work and I was home with my brother in law and neice. I heard strange noises coming from his room. Baby was crying, but it sounded different. I couldn't believe what I was hearing...and then it stopped. I thought of that red spot and immediately thought ""omg, could this be real?"" Anyway, I called my sister and told her, I don't know what happened in that room, you know your man more than I do, but please, never leave him alone with her again. I gave her my reasoning and she sounded like she knew what I was talking about because she didn't ask many followup questions. It was fucking weird.

Anyways, fast forward 4 years later and he has been arrested for child sexual abuse, not from my niece, but from his teenage daughter from his past relationship. My point in saying this is, my niece is traumatized at 5 years old and she doesn't even notice because she's so young. She has no idea what her dad did to her but yet she knows her dad's in prison. My sister strangely allows him to call her and talk to her as well. It quite frankly pisses me off. He calls her and says ""daddy loves you, I miss you, etc...and she says it right back to him as well, unknowingly still being manipulated by the man that assaulted her most likely for years. Her behavior is strange for a 5 year old as well. She hates wearing clothes. Loves running around in underwear and asks to go out in town like that as well. Stuffs her shirt with stuff to make it appear she has boobs. Wears my sisters high heels and steals her make up and literally tries to appear beautiful....now I get it, little kids do this...I get it. However, with her past, my sister shouldn't be allowing her to do this, but she does, and it's sick. Both her and her daughter need to seek therapy.",Mindweav3r,False,1715995956.0

If you are not already, get yourself into therapy immediately. You need a professional, safe environment to explore all of this, and eventually heal from it. Depending on where you are, this might mean approaching a psychiatrist, psychologist or counsellor.

1cuh1to,"I am so, so sorry you have had to go through this. And for what you are going through now.

As someone who has been in an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship, but did not understand it until a while after I got out, I relate to the confusion you are feeling. And the minimizing/justifying of her behavior... You remember now what happened. You feel it, and understand it. But your mind isn't able to accept it yet, and there is this massive confusion between the image you had of her, and the image you now see. They cannot exist at the same time, and it causes emotional chaos. It may feel like you are about to implode, and like you want to bang your head against the wall to get the feelings out of you. 

I know it doesn't seem like it now, but it will get better. Once you are able to accept what happened, you can process it. It takes time, but you can get through it. You do not owe your mom anything! Yes, she sexually abused you. And your dad enabled it, because he didn't stop her. It was sexual, there is no other reason. People excusing sexual abuse using other reasons are lying to themselves, because they cannot accept the truth. Just like you are doing now, to protect yourself. 

Use these answers to get confirmation. Read what you need to read. But seek help from someone with understanding of this type of trauma, cause this isn't something you should try to go through by yourself.

1cuh1to,"From a fellow child sexual abuse survivor who also struggled in the past to accept that it was indeed sexual abuse, I'm telling you what you faced, is most definitely sexual abuse. I'm so sorry OP.

It is difficult to acknowledge it as SA because, one, your brain is protecting you, two, its extremely difficult to see your mom as an abuser since she has done other ""motherly"" things that she ought to do like feed you, cloth you, educate you, etc. Just try thinking about it from this perspective: would you still not call it SA if it was done to you by a stranger?

When SA takes place at the hands of people who claim to love us and often have done other things which fall in the realm of things people do to people they love, its very difficult to differentiate the abuse and love. But let me tell you all of it is manipulation and abuse. Love is nothing like this. People don't abuse the person they love in any manner whatsoever.

Our brains often accept the version of truth which protects us the best. For you, right now, that version is that your mother did not SA you.

When these boundaries are crossed, it feels weird and uncomfortable (naturally) because in certain relationships (like with family) there is supposed to be expectation and guarantee of our own privacy and rights when it comes to body parts and sexual things, in order to feel healthy and safe.

1cuh1to,"This is still very recent in some of the behavior that you have gone through. I am proud you have taken the step to reach out and question about your mother's behavior and whether you have been abused in any way. The fact that you are asking this to yourself and here will help process it.

Sexual abuse comes in many forms. You HAVE been sexually abused and mentally abused consistently! I am so sorry you are confused about this and what it actually means. You are a victim of a crime that no person should have to experience. Do not let her or anyone tell you otherwise or excuse your mother from what she has done. What she has done is violate your trust. 

Do you have a good relationship with your father?
Do you think he may have turned a blind eye to this? If so this makes him an accessory to the acts your mother did to you. 

Your next step NEEDS to be about getting yourself safe from her right now. No contact with her is best so you can get help for yourself without her confusing you more. She most likely has mental health issues herself. 

You need to talk to a professional in sexual abuse to understand it all and for your mental health. There are phone numbers for crisis, sexual abuse, mental health etc. They will give you the help and support to start from there. Please reach out to someone you can trust! A forum has too many conflicting suggestions and not professional help that you need but I am thankful you have reached out in some way to understand and get advice on what you have been through.

Like most other people have commented, I'd suggest therapy, both to deal with the feelings and thoughts that will come from realizing that what happened to you was more serious than you thought it was, and to make sure that your lack of bodily autonomy as a child has not caused issues with forming healthy physical boundaries as an adult. Boundaries are very important, especially if you are romantically and/or sexually involved with someone. Good luck 💙",expat_mel,False,1715994921.0

If you're absolutely sure that you don't want to risk mandated reporting right now, you can try sharing some more general things like, ""I didn't always have privacy when changing my clothes, so I'm not sure I have a good sense of what is and is not appropriate"" or ""I think because of some strange family dynamics I never really learned how to set firm boundaries with what I'm comfortable with - can you help me learn to do that?"" Explain calmly that you don't really want to get into specifics about the dynamics/behaviors but would still like help learning healthy views on sex & relationships, setting boundaries, and healthy coping. If you feel like you might accidentally share something you're not ready to, it may help to write down exactly what you want to say and ask so that you have a ""script"" when you talk to your therapist.

The problem is that you are constantly fuelling negative thoughts by repeating them in your head and trying to justify what happened. The way our brain operates is different and the thing is “what you run from ends up chasing you”.

Two days ago I purchased very famous book on amazon called “Overcoming unwanted intrusive thoughts by Sally M Winston” and read it 2/3 and it completely changed my mind. It teaches you technique how you should not try to avoid or justify intrusive thoughts because they end up just getting worse and worse but instead you should learn to take power from them by recognising them as just thoughts and eventually they will fade away or they will not bother you at all since they are just thoughts (we have many thoughts in day that we forget because we don’t react to them since they are not important - the issue with this is your reaction).

1cuda92,"Hello, first of all I’m so sorry for your loss. What you’re experiencing genuinely is one of the worst feelings in the world. Grief for a dog is so unique because of their intense loyalty and positive presence they provide. There isn’t much you can find to replace it.

I lost my childhood dog of 14 years 2 years ago. It was the worst experience I have ever been through. Worse than the deaths of family members worse than breakups just horrible. My dog was my comfort from a not so stable home life. When I noticed him getting sick I didn’t wanna believe it. After a visit to the vet I spent half a week giving him IV treatment in my room and feeding him by hand trying to keep him alive until he eventually passed while we were laying down together on my floor. Afterwards I was grieving and furious cause none of my family or friends cared about his passing and I spent many weeks in bed skipping my college classes and drinking all day long. 

I literally do not go more than 3 hours without thinking of him to this day. I sleep with his plush Lamb Chops dog toy every night. His death was a big reason actually for why I initially started going to therapy which has been a huge help in all of this and more. But the only tangible relatable thing I can tell you, is this will never go away. Especially that empty feeling you perfectly described. 

One of the few things that got me through the chronic debilitating grief was remembering that loving feeling. Right now I don’t think I’ll be able to get another dog again in my life, however knowing that such a special relationship existed in my life, during my childhood especially, is something I am so grateful for. It got me through so much. 
That’s what I would advise for you. Be grateful that you experienced such an intense and true love from your dog. Cherish that relationship. Even though she is gone the memories of her love and care are still there. Those memories from my dog give me hope that there is true, unbiased, unmotivated love in this world and hopefully we can pass on just a small fraction of that to the people we encounter. 

PS: There will likely be people who try to, but don’t let anyone try to make your dogs passing insignificant. Like I said for myself it was worse than any other tragic event in my life. 

I hope this rambling helped in some way.

1cubleb,"Hi.  Lifelong psychiatry patient here, over 25 years now.   I've also been addicted to Xanax three times, by three different psychiatrists.   

This is a subject I feel qualified to comment on, I'm saying.

There's a couple things that jump out to me.  

1.   Your psychiatrist (or other prescribing professional) MUST be involved in your psychotropic meds.   The fact that you are trying to be deceitful here, or game the system, or somehow bypass the safety controls in the system says a lot.   I'll let you make meaning of it, but it is a huge red flag.

2.  Going into a prescribing relationship with the attitude 'I must have drug X' is also concerning.   Your provider does this all day long.   They have literally seen your case a thousand times or more.   They know what drugs and doses work, and which ones do not.   If Xanax is appropriate, they would prescribe it.   

3. Last one is a piece of advice, that stems from my experience.   If you want to subvert the system and get prescribed drug X, the best way to go about it is definitely NOT to ask for it.   In fact, that is 'drug seeking behavior', which is always suggestive of addiction.   Do not ask for a specific drug.    Instead, mention the specific symptoms for which a short-acting anti-anxiety medication is most appropriate.  

4.  Things have changed over the last 5 years.   Controls over psych meds have become much more severe, at least in my state.   The days of breezing in and out with a script for 360 1mg Xanax are over.   (Those days did exist, I'm sad to say.  I was there)   I'd adjust your expectations.  

  
Good luck either way.   I've been fighting major depression and anxiety a long time, I know what it is like.   Be patient.",HourParticular8124,False,1715982866.0

1cubleb,You may be right but I think I'm going to need a lot more than what you say to believe you. I'm quite skeptical of this. Everything I've been conditioned to believe is that benzos are only appropriate for prescriptions of less than 1 month or sparingly as-needed ,TiKels,False,1715982147.0
1cubleb,"I've had three different psychiatrists prescribe me three medication regiments, simply because they believed in their comfortable cocktails. None of them have recommended changing the Xanax XR. I've been on them for 5 years now. 


I have weekly therapy that monitors my mood and checks for changes and that doctor has full permission to contact my current psychiatrist. He can even contact my psychiatrist without telling me. I also have psychiatrist visits every 1-3 months, depending on status. There is significant oversight for my condition as I have a high stress job. I have also had a mental hospital stay, yet again they did not think it would be removed. After a long observation, I believe it would have been removed if an issue. 


Benzo meds also have been used more recently to treat mania in bipolar people. It is significantly less damaging than other meds I take, and uses a different pathway than my other medicines. It has helped me control manic episodes and I feel no high off it. Consider that I would need to raise my depakote or Lamictal levels or go back to rhisperdal. Risperdal is terrible to be on and the side effects were unbearable. Basically, I've worked for years now to come up with a cocktail that can assist in controlling my condition. Xanax (for me) doesn't pull the handbrake like rhisperdal, but it does let me have time to contact my doctors. 


Also remember Xanax is the safest benzo, the amount to off yourself is quite high. You do lose the ability to drink, which I'm fully OK with. You will become physically dependent on it (not the same as addiction) which is obviously worrying. You should avoid it if you have an addictive personality, which I don't.

1cubfew,"I hear you man. I'm 38 and basically have one really meaningful long-term friend, and haven't even been on a single date in over a decade. The loneliness is downright crippling at times, but I have a lot of trauma in my past, a lot of it around my own sense of value and worth in relationships, that makes it really hard for me to connect with people that way, so it's the hand I was dealt.

It's great that you have family you can lean on in that way (I don't.) Even if they're not the most fulfilling relationships, you'd be amazed how much you can miss just interacting with other people when that stops being the case, so I'd suggest being thankful that's there.

I wish I knew some advice to give you, but clearly it's something I struggle with as well and if I knew how to fix it I'd have done so for myself. The only thing I can think of to suggest is that maybe you can't rely on other people to initiate with you, and need to start initiating more yourself?

As for hobbies and stuff, maybe check sites like Facebook or MeetUp and see if there's any groups in your area that do these things together? Maybe that will at least help you meet some people you have things in common with, and hope something sparks.

I think it's phenomenal that you realize how much effort you put into yourself as far as your appearance and hygiene, because at the end of the day, taking steps to take care of yourself are so, so so important. On that same note, part of taking care of yourself isn't just limited to your physical appearance- it's also about taking care of your emotions, feelings, and the needs that accompany them (aka, your brain! Take care of your brain, too!) This may tie into your feelings of loneliness and lack of self-confidence. Remember, we live in an age where loneliness has become RAMPANT, because of social media, smartphones, etc. Maybe reflect and ask yourself if endless scrolling is contributing to your feelings of loneliness or being disconnected? Even a quick, three-day experiment of pulling back on your digital usage could be enough to help you figure this out!

I've always been a big advocate of talk-therapy, ESPECIALLY for young men like you, because of these changes in our lifestyle and society. It's easy for us boys to feel pretty lost, and that's okay! We're not lost- we just may need a little help! Talk therapy has never been more accessible, and I'd recommend a platform such as talkspace or betterhelp (talkspace takes insurance).

These things collectively could give you a great start to start combatting these feelings. But remember, it WILL take time.

But you need to consider what that means as well. You’re right, medical bills and debt are a factor. You will be forced onto psych based medicine (part of what you consent to when you sign up for it)
You don’t know how long you’ll be there. Average for a lot of folks is 3-7 days, but you’re under the “care” of the psychiatrist that is assigned to your case. You’re not coming out until they think you’re no longer a danger to yourself or society.

1cubceb,"Assuming here you're in the US:

It is so much better, you get treated better and have more rights when you admit yourself versus being admitted ""against your will"". So unless you're about to do something you'll probably regret, check yourself in as a voluntary patient instead of an involuntary patient. Telling your doctor or therapist that you are going to...yourself will likely get you committed as an involuntary patient, that should only be reserved for emergencies. It's a legal thing. As involuntary, you are not allowed to direct your care or check yourself out without a judge giving you the okay. It's similar to being arrested (unfortunately no joke). 

Anyway, there are a few options to get a stay in the mental hospital:

If you have health insurance, call who covers your mental healthcare, sometimes under ""behavioral health"". Ask what providers are in your network. If you're not currently seeing a psychiatrist, you're going to need one. Say that it is urgent and if you can possibly get a sooner appointment. A psychiatrist can then arrange an inpatient stay when you go to your appointment. If you already have a psychiatrist, you can ask for an urgent appointment, and again, they will probably recommend a place and send a prior authorization for you to go there. Insurance usually wants authorization first, because inpatient stays are expensive. The doctor has to fill out a form saying an inpatient stay is necessary. But it's similar to getting a hospital stay for anything else, like getting your appendix out. You then check into the psychiatric hospital that they referred you to.

If you're uninsured/or underinsured, look up what your county hospital/hospital district is. This is the public hospital that gets funding from grants and tax money. Sometimes you can even find the psychiatric hospital/unit that they run. Sometimes called psychiatric emergency services (like an ER but for mental health). You can either show up there and ask to be admitted, or if you can't find what their psychiatric unit is, just go to their regular emergency room. You will get evaluated by a psychiatrist on call and really stress that you need an inpatient stay because you, ""fear for your health and safety"" or something along those lines. Since you showed up there yourself, you will likely be admitted under voluntary status.

(These hospitals won't cost as much but they're also not very nice places in general). I got my bills written off in 7 years with only some dings to my credit score. They pretty much assume people going there can't pay their bills. 

Then there's option three. The nuclear option. Involuntary status. Call 911 or any suicide hotline and tell them you're ready to do it and you have a plan. Police and an ambulance will come to your house. The paramedics will do a quick check of you, and transport you to the nearest emergency room (no, you don't get to pick under this scenario). Maybe you will go in the back of the police car in handcuffs. It depends on how polite you are, and how the first responders feel that day. Ambulance rides are nicer but way more expensive. The cop car is free, but you're going to be handcuffed. Then they'll admit you to the psychiatric department through the emergency room. They're not allowed to experiment on humans, but they are allowed to give you whatever treatment they want as an involuntary patient, unless you're allergic to it. That means if you have depression but they want to say you're psychotic, they can give you anti-psychotics. If you decline treatment, they will say you're non-compliant and being ""combative"", even if you're totally polite about it. It's their word against yours, and as one intelligent nurse said to me, ""who's going to believe you? You are the patient"". Thus, you are the crazy one. This is how most people end up in the psychiatric hospital, so you're not alone picking this option. But bless your heart, it's a miserable ride. 

I've done all of these myself, and I would highly recommend the first two over the last option. But the last option is a guaranteed way to get that ""psychiatric holiday"", maybe a court mandated 90 days of it. No, they don't care if you have rent, a job, or pets to feed. They're locking your ass up with the last option, but it is keeping you safe when you are a harm to yourself. Hopefully you have a responsible person who will feed your cat and keep you from getting evicted if you pick option 3. I would totally go voluntarily. You can still stay and get help, get stabilized, get caught up on sleep, separate yourself from your toxic environment, whatever you need. A voluntary stay can also turn into an involuntary one if you say certain things (I think you know what they are- directly threatening harm to yourself or others). If you have insurance, I would start by calling the behavioral health line. It's usually answered by a real human 24/7.

You can be medicated involuntarily on an emergent situation or if petitioned and granted by a judge.  2)hospitalization stays vary on a case by case basis. Laws differ from state to state, but each state has its own variation of a specified timeline for voluntary hospitalizations where you must be released unless your case is going to be taken to court and the judge will extend your stay. Here in Illinois, it’s 5 days. 3) you can still join the military. You will need your recruiter to file a waiver on your behalf. More than likely the waiver will be approved. You can also have a government job as well as be a LEO with a psych history; however, there are certain barring diagnosis such as schizophrenia for obvious reasons. 4) Federally, you can buy and own firearms granted that you were not involuntarily hospitalized or adjudicated as mentally defective by a court (this is straight from the 4473 form). State laws are different and may prohibit ownership or conceal carry for a certain period. Illinois requires a firearm owners identification card (FOID) to own firearms and its also needed for conceal carry. The FOID card gets revoked with any kind of psychiatric hospitalization and there is a ownership prohibition period of 5 years from the last hospitalization. This is different in states that do not require any kind of licensure for firearm ownership. 5) it is highly illegal to deny housing or evict someone based disability including mental illness. Any fresh out of law school attorney would win the case if it ever even went to court.

1cubceb,"Don’t listen to that guy. Most of that information is anecdotal and false. If you are not doing so well that you are considering to be hospitalized then you should definitely seek treatment. You may not need to get hospitalized and can seek treatment on an outpatient basis. 

Just so you know, there is a significant difference between voluntary and involuntary hospitalization. I’ve seen commercial pilots, train conductors, police officers, and active duty military personnel who were hospitalized and continue to be employed in their respective fields. Only certain jobs require that you disclose any mental illness or a hospitalization. Otherwise, this is information is protected federally by HIPAA (assuming that you are in the US). You can request for a doctor’s note for when you miss work that mentions that you were hospitalized but does not disclose the type of hospitalization or the reason . If your employer does find out, there may be restrictions placed on your duties. These restrictions are usually temporary. Yes, mental health stigma does exist, but you’d surprised how accommodating and understanding some employers could be. It may be extremely difficult to get better on your own and you are on here for a reason.

1cubceb,"Uhm. Unless your career specifically ask about mental health (medical, military, pilots, etc)….. and as long as you’re voluntary (you should get notice if you’re involuntary)…. Then you’ll still be able to get a gun, etc…..

If you are involuntary (a lot of psych wards are requiring this), it is more likely to happen if police pick you up or you go to the ER…. But once you there, just ask the psychiatrist if you can become voluntary….. they can switch it over up until you get on a court order or possibly discharged first….keep asking daily… in my case over 30 hospitalizations, simply asking to be switched to voluntary works 50-80% of the time. 

Involuntary court orders are put in the Law Enforcement Information Network…. My state police will send a letter explaining that you’re not allowed to purchase fire arms. 

Another option is go to what’s called a freestanding psychiatric hospital not connected to another hospital system…. They typically do their own evaluations and let you be voluntary…. 

If you’re not a danger to yourself or others, look for an outpatient mental health professional…. Or ask your primary care for a referral.

1cub05m,I can't really speak on the rest but what your dad does to you is in fact abuse,Itsmetheotherjacob,False,1715974874.0
1cuabxi,"Hi there,

First, let me just say how incredibly brave and strong you are. Opening up about your feelings and experiences, especially during such a challenging time, takes immense courage. It's okay to feel scared and disconnected right now—what you're going through is a lot for anyone to handle, and it's natural to feel overwhelmed. I want to validate your feelings because they are completely understandable. Breaking up after a decade, especially with children involved, is a significant life change. On top of that, you're dealing with pregnancy hormones and the complexities of maintaining a stable environment for your kids. Anyone in your situation would find it difficult to cope.

It's wonderful that you've taken the proactive step to get therapy. This shows just how much you care about your well-being and your family's. Sometimes, though, the road to feeling better isn't straightforward, and it can take time to find the right balance and strategies that work for you. Feeling disconnected and like life is moving too fast is something many people experience in times of great stress. This sensation, often described as depersonalization, can be frightening, but it's also your mind's way of trying to protect you from overwhelming emotions. It's okay to feel this way, and it's important to be gentle with yourself during these moments.

You are not alone. Many people have gone through similar feelings and have come out stronger. It's important to remember that there is light at the end of the tunnel, even if it feels far away right now. Self-care is key, so continue to focus on your mental health. Whether it's through therapy, meditation, gentle exercise, or simply giving yourself permission to rest, taking time for yourself is crucial. Reach out for support and lean on trusted friends and family members. Sometimes just talking about your feelings can provide relief and make you feel more connected. Celebrate small victories because even getting through a day or managing to complete a simple task is an accomplishment, and each small step forward is progress.

Try to find little moments to connect with your unborn child. Simple activities like talking to your baby or playing soft music can help foster that connection. Remember that feelings of disconnection and fear are not permanent. With time, patience, and support, you will find your way back to feeling more like yourself. You are doing an amazing job under incredibly tough circumstances. It's okay to feel what you're feeling, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it. You have so much strength and resilience within you, and brighter days are ahead. Keep being kind to yourself and take things one day at a time. You've got this.

I share these diagnoses and have a very similar perception where I just don't really get people anymore. I will never understand how people would want to be treated well or good by others, and then turn around and treat others in a demeaning or hurtful way. I'm very empathic and try my best to always put myself in someone else's shoes as a means of trying to understand and level with others. I grew up in a very abusive household and hearing raised voices is a trigger. I just wish people could understand the gravity of what they say and do in everyday life and understand how it affects people around them and themselves as a whole. Many nights laying in bed, staring at the ceiling lost in thought over this kind of stuff.

The only advice I have for you is based on my personal experiences and I'm not a doctor or medical health professional in any capacity. I went off medication a while back, and it was terrible for 6 months. 2-3 weeks of physical withdrawals and several months until I could find my sense of Normalcy. I made it through to the other side and feel like a person again, not numb to all the BS happening around me. I made a choice, and I chose to face problems rather than take Med and do therapy and hope things will get better. I want to make it clear that this isn't a judgment, more rather a sentiment to those who go through struggles like this. If the Meds truly work for you, keep on keeping on. In my experience, 15 years later i realized they were a big factor in how i felt and viewed the world around me.

Perception is key! The world will always present a set of scenarios that you will feel some type of way about, every day. Me mindful of your thoughts and trust yourself. It gets better when you learn to look at things from a different view.

I don’t know how old this parent is, or how old you are, but if you are a legal adult and have the means to leave, do it. 

My reasoning is that these people are typically “blissfully unaware” of who they are as a person. They are empathetic, so they see themselves as good natured. They actively block out the negative traits they have. If they become aware for a second how destructive they truly are, they completely implode. So they become masters of deceiving themselves without even realizing it. What I’m trying to say is they could say awful things to you, try to break you down, but will subconsciously block out that experience so they can carry on. When my mom was diagnosed with brain cancer, my dad screamed at her white in the face everyday until the day she passed away and he literally couldn’t anymore. While it was happening and even days to weeks after it happened, he has no recollection of any of it, like it never happened.

It sounds harsh and it sucks, but if you don’t want to become this you have to leave asap. If they can’t come to terms with themselves, you can’t make them either. Cut your losses, heal the damage, and try to carry on. No sense in going down with the ship.",obscureproducer4725,False,1715962334.0

It, like everything else in your body, needs to rest adequately and consistently to function properly. Unless you want to be in a psych ward or be a life long experimental medication consumer, DO NOT tell a medical professional about the hallucinations. If it gets to the point where your hallucinations are telling you things or instructing you to hurt yourself or others, that is the only point where I would cross that line and “get help”. There is a very negative stigma toward people that deal with this kind of thing, even temporarily.

When I was diagnosed with insomnia they gave sleeping pills that had even worse side effects than the said pros they talked about. After making some research I found out that they make it harder to sleep without them as your body builds tolerance so that you have to keep buying them which is quite insane tbh.

The easier it is to be anonymous the more people let out their true feelings and some people are just terrible under their masks of niceties. While you are looking for genuine socialization others are looking for a power trip. Try to focus on people that don’t take themselves so seriously and don’t feel the need to be above others or put people down or anything like that. You can’t always predict whether someone is going be nice or not cause empathy is conditional; they might be super empathetic to one person but terrible to you. It’s not as straightforward as it should be. Lots of cognitive dissonance.

News articles baiting engagement by saying something that sets people off in their title is an easy and simple example, but overall most people seem to have a knee jerk reaction to seeing people being themselves online as the worst possible interpretation of it.

There are some communities that are diehard about being positive, and those are typically more safe (though not totally safe), and at times like these it's probably best to avoid the internet as much as possible.  If you still end up online, interacting with spaces like that is probably best.

I'm kinda going through it right now too.  I'll chat with someone in a friendly way online and they'll take it as if it's some kind of personal attack and start slinging insults back and a bunch of people will side with them and gang up.  It's a magnet for humanity at its worst.

But people aren't that way normally.  The internet draws the worst out of us and it's not accurate to how everyone really feels.  I usually try to kill those interactions with more kindness and not let it get to me, but that only works for so long.

1cu1mof,"Maybe start by trying to forgive yourself. 

Self-hatred is an internalized belief system which is often formed at an early age as a child's primitive attempt to reason and rationalize traumatic abuse and/or neglect. A child's reasoning capacities are not fully developed and the child can interpret abuse/neglect from caregivers as if there is something personally wrong with him/herself. Young children absorb experiences like a sponge and they go directly into the subconscious mind where they form the foundation of their psyche, so even negative programming from outside sources such as media and entertainment can be internalized on some level. Gabor Maté has done great work on this subject.

Overcoming self-hatred involves surfacing and challenging negative, harmful subconscious beliefs about ourself (CBT is good for this) and learning to forgive oneself for our perceived shameful wrongs or deficits and, ultimately, develop compassion for ourself.

A lof of the time, I just hate everything about myself and where I am.

Sometimes the solution starts with getting out of uncomfortable or unsafe environments that might be hurting you and how you think about yourself.
Honestly, it starts with therapy. They will help you out the most with that, but from what I learned from my therapist is that we're hardest on ourselves more then anyone else might be. 
You just gotta start being easier on yourself. Redirect hurtful thoughts by questioning it or distract yourself. Even dunking your face in ice cold water for a few seconds, or taking a nice bath or shower could help the thoughts are too much.

1cu1mof,"I've been working with a therapist and feel my self hatred stems from a few things as a child. One was my Mother always expected perfection when it came to my school work. So anything less then 100% or A on a test I would be moved to tears because I was unable to handle it. I also feared I might be hit for not being the best of the best.

Meanwhile my brother was a complete piece of shit who bullied and abused me physically and verbally for years. I understand it came from a place of jealousy and feeling like I was the favorite son. But due to all that abuse I wound up really hating myself - my looks, my personality, etc...

Now coping with it has been and is still a very hard thing on a day to day basis. I try to do things to make myself feel better about me like working out, trying to eat healthy but indulging when I can from time to time, and sometimes just doing mirror talks with myself. 

They basically equate to the comical Stuart Smalley SNL skit of how he would look in the mirror. I give myself positive affirmations about ""you deserve better then how you feel about yourself and your a swell guy, believe you are.""

It's really not easy to tell you the truth. Anytime things go sideways life wise it's very easy for me to fall into a bit of pit of feelings where I will get down on myself. I shouldn't.

As if you want to those bad feelings to come. And hold this for like 15 seconds with your full attention. Then carry on, but still don't try to stop it. Let yourself be anxious.

What I can say is as not only a healthcare worker but someone who follows combat footage (a similar sensory input) it will wear you over time and you very much will need positive outlets to decompress that stress.

1ctxwl4,"Yes. Everyone is different and there is no method out there that works universally.

What worked for me is as follows:

1) Remove yourself from the stimuli. If you can't until later, white knuckle through it.  
2) Find a quite place, TURN YOUR PHONE OFF OR PUT ON SILENT, and self-reflect.

3) Ask yourself a series of questions: What is wrong? (what is making me feel this way, what is the situation) Why am I emotionally invested to this? or by extension, Why does this matter so much to me? Be mindful and analytical about it. Sometimes it helps to think of it with other common experiences instead of you directly in the situation that's causing your anxiety.

4) Then you ask yourself the most important questions of all: Is it worth it? For me, I apply the situation and think out the worst end it could come too, in my case, committing suicide. This can be hard for a lot of people, but really put yourself in that scenario. If you're like me and suicide is your one solve all (I hope you're not like me). So for context, I play out my funeral in my head. I imagine people that were close to me and care about me and the great amount of pain it would cause them. I think of people that may depend on me and how it could impact them. I think of my mother specifically, and as painful as this all is, Its enough to snap me out of a dark place every time. Deep breathing helps while you're doing this because its not fun and your heartrate will elevate even if you're not going to the extreme I do. 

I just want you to understand a few things. Feeling emotion is normal, acting out based on emotion is problematic. The healthcare world at large wants you to be medicated, and nearly all medications available are experimental and not tested or designed for use past months to a year. Don't consent to a lifetime of being medicated over being anxious or depressed for a period of time. Its normal, shit happens, that's life. Meds will hurt you 10x over in the long run and make a mountain of a mole hill. Whatever is messing with you or your mental, face it head on. Everyone has the inner strength to overcome any obstacle if they so choose.

1ctwz00,"Thank you for sharing! What you’re going through is tough, and hard to look past at any point. It’s normal to feel how you do. For example: when I was your age, was with an amazing woman for 3 years. Life pulled us in very different directions and although I would have done anything to maintain our relationship, She was the wiser and decided we should move on. What I’m getting at is this is not uncommon, and you won’t forget the real ones. She left a mark that doesn’t come off and while it can hurt it’s not a bad thing. I think about that woman still from time to time and I’m in my late 20’s now. What I would caution you on is this: 

Don’t let the negative emotion surrounding the loss of someone that meant a great deal to you make other problems that didn’t previously exist. Life is very much so how you choose to perceive it. It’s very easy for a young man to lose themselves in these situations. Be strong, pick yourself up, and understand that it’s very normal and very HUMAN to feel this way. There’s no timeline of getting over it, and you never truly 100% get over it. My advice in the short term is to just stay busy. Sounds simple, but just keep moving and fill your day with meaningful tasks! Stay away from drugs and alcohol. Self-reflect often and be aware that not everything will work out how we envision it, most things don’t. You’re young, seems like you got a good head on your shoulders, and a bright future ahead of you. Don’t let this event determine the trajectory of what should be a long and fulfilling life.

However, stay the course and follow your goals. Become an EMT, stay forward looking and in time you’ll suddenly realize the pain is a little less severe. There’s no rule book. This is yours to go through in your timeframe. Eventually you’ll be okay and begin to feel occasional joy and you’ll laugh a little. Bit by bit you’ll integrate this loss into who you are. Hopefully you’ll learn about yourself, make some changes and maybe you’ll find someone new, and better yet you’ll learn to enjoy your own company. You’ll move from struggling to survive to a life where you’re thriving. But there’s no short cuts. You have to go through the pain.

Relationships in general are extremely tough, and take a lot of understanding, compassion, and understanding for both partners to share mutually. It's extremely easy to fall into the mindset to where you don't feel understood or your needs aren't met, and start to villainize your partner, especially in a something legally binding like a marriage.

If you want my honest take that is only working off of the details described in this post: You need to be aware that your partner is struggling too. You mentioned a list of things that hurt you, and mostly negative things about the partner. There's a lot going on, but don't ever underestimate how someone begins to feel when they care about you but are also being blamed at the same time. Turns into a spiteful game where everyone playing loses. Unless this guys was a dumpster fire of a man when you met him, he probably is scared/frustrated and doesn't know how to express it.

There are also broader factors involved with mental illness, such as coping strategies, problem-solving skills, social support, and more. For example, an internal locus of control, which is something that you self-describe, contributes to positive mental health and resilience. 

Potentially, maybe some have it better off than others in these regards. I don't necessarily think it has to excuse behavior, but it may explain it. And there may be a very small minority who do abuse the system, which gives it a bad name for people who are struggling. And there are certainly degrees. 

I'm a psych nurse and so have seen people who are severely ill. It can sometimes be harder to see it as an illness in those suffering from less severe or non-psychotic symptoms. I'm not sure if this is helpful.

This may come across as odd, but I see nothing wrong with having to scream into a pillow or even punch a pillow if you are angry. That negative emotion inside your body has to come out some way. If that scares you or disturbs you in any way, you can always figure out another physical way to release that negative energy. For example, you can force yourself to go on a walk/run. You can join a boxing gym and take your anger out that way. 

And yes, part of what you are dealing with is a learned behavior pattern; however, it is not who you are. So with practice, you can stop responding with aggression. Besides, anger is not the root emotion. Figure out what emotion triggered your anger, and you will be so close to achieving your goal.",JClementMD,False,1715910270.0

2. Social Media is toxxxxxxicccccc.  While the world is presented that unrest and craziness is EVERYWHERE, the reality is that it's not everywhere.... It's just exaggerated because chaos grabs attention, and it drives ratings... But it can also depend on what you click on... Whatever you click on, just know that these Social Media Casinos are going to continually feed you more of the same bullshit, and make it addicting (like gambling) at the same time. The more doom scrolling you do, the better..  Sometimes I click on something, and it opens the door to more negative stuff.  I'm also speaking from the fact that I'm subbed to the r/PublicFreakout  and r/ActualPublicFreakouts subreddits 😂🤦🏼‍♂️ Those subs can make you really not like people.

When I was 24 (I'm 32 now), I lived on my own after a breakup, falling out with my family, working a terrible job that consumed all my time, and living alone far away from everyone.  I lived out my greatest fear and it WAS bad....

...but not because I was living alone, but because it was a perfect storm of shitty situations.

Since then I've lived alone more than I've lived with others and realized that it's not so bad.  You get used to it, and it's not as lonely as you'd think.  We're good at adapting, and I tend to visit friends on my time off when I feel the need to see people and I spend time online a lot now, which kind of helps mitigate that feeling of loneliness.  Most of my contact with my friends is online too so it's not like it's just complete random online strangers every time.

In recent years I've had to learn to get out of my shell and seek out new situations with new people more, and with the help of therapy, that's been going great.

We're good at adapting, and as someone who lived out a worst case scenario, I can say it's not so bad.  Now, I kind of fear having roommates because I feel like I'd have the added pressure of being a good roommate to them, which I don't have right now with anyone.

I suffer from complex trauma due to childhood neglect and my anxiety was so bad sometimes the only ‘solution’ I saw was to stop living - which I did not want. I wasn’t suicidal, everything was just too hard to bear. 
So last year I started antidepressants and honestly I feel like it’s the best decision of my life.
I don’t see them as a source of shame, or a ‘band-aid’ for being weak, but as a ‘teacher’ for my brain. It’s not because you start taking them, you’ll take them forever! I don’t know if you tried getting off them with medical supervision, but it’s normal that you experience more stress when getting off them, because the amount of neurotransmitters in your brain are suddenly different.

In my opinion, depression, anxiety or any other mood disorder is an illness just as any other, and sometimes that needs a multitude of treatments to get better. I think my meds are making new pathways in my brain so I can work on myself and find the things that help me, without getting so paralized by my anxiety that I just can’t do it. Once I feel I have my toolkit ready and feel like I know how to deal with life, I will slowly get off them. 
So that’s how I feel, I hope this counts as advice? Eitherway, there’s nothing to je ashamed of, you are just treating an illness. It’s not because it’s ‘in your head’ that it’s not real! Good luck :)",SLLIHHARAS,False,1715890081.0

They will only be able to give you a listening ear & give your perspective but if your looking for ways for them to uplift you in ways they may not be able to, You'll be disappointed.

I’m not in the know specifically but I had this exact situation arise wherein I told my therapist about the abuse, and had a very traumatic experience while they called cps there inquiring about if a report had to be made. I was above the legal age and cps said it was up to me to do a report or not and I of course declined based on my circumstances. I really thought it was going to turn my world upside down. I was grieving all the progress that had been made in my family in those few minutes, and I genuinely hope whatever happens you will be alright, it’s one of the toughest things I’ve experienced. Im not sure if my state was in charge of the guideline or not, but I do  think it wouldn’t hurt to look up the regulations if that is of interest. I would also like to think your therapist should have been transparent in their duty to report or not- even when it comes to mentioning your own abuse I have always been made very aware of the procedures that have to be carried out by a licensed professional.

My heart goes out to you, sounds like you've had the terrible luck of just meeting terrible person after terrible person.
You are much stronger than you are giving yourself credit for, to have come through all that and still be moving forward ..... well, you are obviously a pretty amazing strong person.
Your Social Worker, abused your trust and his position. Regardless of anything you did/started/offered, he was assigned to you to help and knew exactly how you were vulnerable. And as such anything that occurred was not in any form or fashion your fault.
As a child, I was abused and for years felt guilt and shame for years. But then one day, I found how to disconnect myself from those feelings and place the guilt where it should've been all along.
I'm not saying for one second that my experiences are anywhere near the nightmare you have lived,  just saying be gentle on yourself and no matter how dark life seems, never stop looking around for that ""chink of light"" in the darkness,  that offers hope .... and then just take everything one step at a time. 
Your happiness is out there, don't ever stop looking for it!

P.S. and as to your sleazy Social Worker, I'd suggest you seriously think about reporting him, if for nothing to save some other vulnerable female from feelings you've got presently.

We stopped talking cause he became so mean but I wasn’t looking for a relationship and he was my best friend. 2 years went by and we saw each other at my senior week and started talking again. I was finally more ready for a relationship and gave him a chance. It was great at first then he slowly got bad I went to college 4hours away and he was home. The second year of us being together it started becoming on and off he would always leave me and treat me bad and every time he left it was a new reason but he would text girls 30 minutes within us fighting or breaking up. After a lot of on and off we dated throughout almost our whole 3rd year and then he broke up with me again after that. Since we broke up there’s been on and off again but he’s the only one that leaves. As far as I know he has never touched another girl but he has had tinder and I have gotten screenshots of how he texts girls and it’s really bad. But when he leaves me I feel like I can’t move on cause I don’t want it to be my fault cause I truly do love him and don’t know what to do. Now I’ll tell him flat out what hurts me and he just calls me crazy or says to stop or shut up and when I cry I don’t think he cares. I just feel like I’m going crazy cause he always finds a way to blame me and he won’t change how he acts but I also feel like I need to do everything perfect for him or he’ll leave me and go to other girls within 30 minutes so that’s also making me like hate myself in a way.

1ctj27n,I had a friend like that that I only saw as a friend but he would literally trick me onto dates and then eventually sexually harassed me and yeah he got mean and bitter too. Honestly if someone is that mean and entitled even before a relationship that should be an indicator that they are way worse the closer you are and you’ve seen how he’s progressed. With him feeling entitled to you and then running off to girls 30 minutes after you have problems that should be the realization that he doesn’t like you at all he just wants entertainment. And how would it be your fault if he’s the one that can’t behave? Even if he somehow turned it around to be your fault who cares you are not his mom and you don’t have to be so responsible for someone who can’t control themselves. Take it upon yourself to be the one that leaves and if he can’t give you space then escalate from there.

I’m not an expert by any means but when I face those same moments where nothing I have to do seems worthwhile, it’s usually true in that moment. Your body could be trying to tell you that it needs rest or even that you need to start focusing on things you find enjoyment from. Even if it’s something as simple as binging TV, playing video games, or like you mentioned sleeping.

1ctgutq,"Therapy is a way to get tools to work on things that are causing you problems in your life. Is your past action causing you problems? Are your current desires causing you problems? 


Do you want someone to confess to because you were never punished? Do you, despite what you say, feel at risk of repeating this and want someone to stop you from doing this sort of thing again? 


Sexuality is to a large extent programmable. We learn ""this feels good"" and on some level our brain never forgets. Our feelings have *nothing* to do with ethics or morals or what's good and kind and right in this world; feelings just *are*. Feelings are neither good nor bad. 


Actions are what matters. You were ignorant and did an ignorant thing driven by feelings. Now you're not ignorant. The feelings remain, but you have a framework which helps you keep on track. You understand more, have developed empathy. 


Kids are often selfish little shits; adults often look back on their past selves with horror. That inner horror comes from a place of growth. 


You trust your therapist, and therapy works best with honesty. Just make sure you understand your goal in therapy and are willing to do what you and your therapist agree needs to be done to achieve your goals. ",No_Savings7114,False,1715877088.0
1ctgutq,"The fact that you want to tell her is more of a testament to your character than what you did and I think she would be proud of you for reaching out for help. When I’ve had to tell my therapist challenging things in the past, I have found a few different methods helpful. It can really depend on what makes you most comfortable:

 • You can send it in an email and ask her if she’d be willing to read the email in-session to help you with it.

• You can write it out in a letter and let her read it.

Those two ^ are best if you have trouble saying it out loud.

• You can turn away from your therapist or look away from your therapist so you don’t have to see her reaction to what you say, this makes it easier.

• You can turn your brain off and disassociate a little bit and just start saying the facts of the matter. For me, the first two words were challenging but once I started, it got *so much easier* and I ended up successfully saying everything in one go.

• You can tell her the story hypothetically and then admit at the end that it isn’t hypothetical and that you are struggling.

But I knew what I was doing was wrong, and yet I planned it out for days, even wrote out exactly what to do so I wouldn't forget it.

Edit: just looked it up, that's okay then if she does it correctly.
""Yes, a therapist can drop a client, but they must take steps to ensure the client has the resources and support to move forward without them. This is called client abandonment, which is an ethical issue. The therapist should end the relationship in a way that leaves the client with the support they need.

1ctgebf,"Been there, still there. You’re not alone and thank you for sharing.

A lot of people don’t really get it, I won’t pretend I get your scenario either, but I’m always ALWAYS thinking. Anything from problems solving scenarios to conversation ands places 15 years ago. Heck, sometimes I trail off mid conversation, lost in thought. Brian fog can happen, I don’t remember a lot of finer details like people’s names surrounding times I experienced a lot of pain and trauma, just faces. It happens to the best of thinkers. 

My advice: 
Research intrusive thinking for a start. Thoughts that aren’t necessarily your own consistent thought patterns but more like your anxieties manifest as thoughts that you pass off as your own true way of thought.

Once you can learn to differentiate the types of thoughts. Look into spirituality and history behind it. Some take aways I had from that venture was understanding myself and separating me from the things happening around me that aren’t me. Spiritual practices and cultures are one of the longest prevailing traditions in humanity and there is reason for that.

Some other tips:
Give yourself a break. Too much thought can be bad. You can get lost in the expansive universe between your ears. If you’re ever “in too deep” or you can’t live a productive life because you’re compulsively thinking unchecked, do your best to fill your day with meaningful and fulfilling tasks, it helps. Form a support network outside of your biological family. Friends can help a lot and they won’t judge you as harshly or be as confused/concerned as parents, siblings, aunts/uncles etc.
Reach out if you have any questions.

1ctf6tn,"Finding good friends is hard. What doesn't help is that ""friendship"" can mean very different things from person to person.

Some have a very lose definition and friends are just people they interact with semi-regularily or they go drinking with.

Others see it in a narrower fashion and only consider people whom they can trust and mutually share their emotions, secrets and problems with as friends.

From my subjective experience, most people match the first definition or are inbetween the first and the second one.

This means that some, and sometimes a lot of, searching is needed to find suitable friends, but they are out there.

The crux of the matter is that often, it's these moments of ""weakness"" you mentioned where it shows which type they are. So without accepting vulnerability you may never find out.

There are two paths forward: Capitulation + acceptance or trying to outgrow that traumatic experience which has understandably left a bad taste in your mouth regarding others.

Whichever you choose - commit to it. I.e. deciding that it's not worth the hassle but still dealing with all the ""what if""s and drowning yourself in sorrow over ""what will never be"", is by far the unhealthiest thing you can do.

Thus my recommendation make a decision and see it through without looking back. Best wishes!",kiffmet,False,1715887149.0

Right off the bat I would like to tell you that if you can afford it or if insurance covers it, talking out complex emotions like these with a good licensed therapist is one of the best things you can do! It has helped me come a long way in my life.

But in my unprofessional opinion, the fact that you like to take care of your appearance and make yourself look pretty is a great thing! There is nothing at all wrong with taking the time to look how you wanna look. It doesn’t have to be for any reason or for any person. Do what makes you feel good! 

Just also be sure to remember that no one can look 100% their best all time. The goal is to have empathy with yourself no matter what state you’re in. Don’t be ashamed of feeling any emotion no matter what it is, this is what it means to be human to feel!

1ctbgzo,"I think his reaction to what you have been through/are going through depends less on his current views on MH and more on your relationship with him. 

I have bipolar which was diagnosed a few years ago after I went to the hospital because I hadn't slept for days. I had moved across the country for school, so my family was not aware of what I was going through. I went to visit a few months later, at which point I was relatively stable and appeared healthy as ways. I found that it was easier to tell them when I was in a good place because I knew they would react in a better way, as they could see that it did not change who i am, and they would not have even known anything was up unless I told them. 

For background, I'm American and my parents are immigrants from South Asia and never talked about MH with me, despite there being a family history of bipolar and suicide. I had a conversation with my psychiatrist about my diagnosis and how to navigate conversation with them and came to the conclusion that it would not benefit me or them to tell them while I was still in crisis mode because chances are they would fly across the country and start helicoptering and make me feel all kinds of ways. 

So how did I tell them? I didn't necessarily even plan the conversation. I was in the car with them one day when I was back home for winter break a few months after my diagnosis, when I just felt like it was a moment I could disclose what I was going through. I said it very casually. That I had gone to the ED because I wasn't eating or sleeping and am now taking medicine for bipolar, which make me feel better and like myself again. I think talking about it so casually and being in a good place and discussing that medicine made me better normalized it more with them. They asked some questions and also asked why I didn't tell them sooner. I told them the truth that I didn't want them to worry and it's something I needed to go through myself but that I was also better now because I got help. I also countered this question with saying that I didn't have to tell them and they wouldn't know if I hadn't disclosed it at all because I am still the same person.

I was scared too. I could have never predicted their reaction. But I also had faith that they cared about me and would understand that I was in pain and getting help changed my life. It felt important to tell them in order to fight the stigma and for them to understand that MH is real and must be talked about. Despite our issues, my parents love me, try to understand me, and worry about my health. Having that relationship with them facilitated a productive conversation. I think the MH stigma is a beast that can't be tackled from one conversation, but you can start by proving to your dad that MH is real because you, as someone he loves, personally experienced hardship because of it and had to get help in order to get better. I think my parents saw that and realized that my MH was out of my control, and there was nothing wrong with me treating it just as I would treat diabetes if I had it. 

I hope this is helpful to you in some way. Good luck moving forward, and I am proud of you for getting the help you need and being able to talk about it with people even if you haven't told your dad yet.",upside_down_butt,False,1715863693.0
1ctbgzo,"Hello, 

First of all congrats to you for breaking the cycle that your father unfortunately may still be in, and taking the time and work to address your mental health! It can be a lot harder than people make it out to be.

I totally relate to what you’re saying about your father. My own parents are generally nice people, but their views on mental health are also extremely old fashioned. They are also religious so they tend to rely on that more than any actual professional help. 

I have been going to therapy for a year now and still have not told them myself. I have previously tried to bring up very generic mental health topics in terms of the world’s relationship with social media, rising depression/suicide rates etc. and received just very negative and ugly responses. Eventually between that and all of the emotional neglect I have felt from them my whole life, I realized some people just can’t change. They have developed these mechanisms in them that help them survive, help them feel tough and help them get through every day. It’s hard to get someone to crack on beliefs they hold so strongly without them being open minded to change. 

In my opinion, I wouldn’t tell your father unless you sense that he is ready to accept a concept like that. Who knows? Maybe hell watch a show read an article see something on the news that changes his mind. But from my experience getting those feelings rejected cab cause mental relapse which makes all the progress you've made seem insignificant.

In the end, mental health is a very personal thing and I think you meed to be very careful on who you select to be vulnerable with. Be proud of yourself for the progress you have made and don't let anyone's negativity stop you from growing.

I wish you all the best!",Old_Count2231,False,1715865455.0

You should speak to a doctor, there are medications that can help with this condition and some people benefit from therapy also.

Personally, I've found it helpful to try and improve on the things that bother me about my appearance. My weight typically fluctuates throughout the year and I do become very bothered by gaining a few pounds, so I simply help my mind out by shedding them. You must have realistic expectations though, I'm not going down the cosmetic surgery route as with BDD it often doesn't resolve anything, sometimes it causes even more issues with the condition so it's not a risk I'm willing to take. Same goes for weight loss, please aim to get to a healthy weight, you do **not** want to strive to be underweight. That would begin a fall into anorexia territory which is a terrifying condition.

Anger itself is normal and healthy. Personally I find that I internally suppress my anger. When it comes out it’s dark and quiet, but I’ve not acted on it since I was little.

Therapy can be good for everyone and it can help having a professional who can help support and guide you with practical tools and practices that show significant beneficial results. I say give therapy a go, and they can also give you an assessment to determine if you are an eligible candidate for anti-depressants or anxiety medication.

1ct6mno,"As men stereotypically prefer solutions to emotional validation, I'm going to talk through the fixes for problems men face. I am a man, I am at different levels of progress with these things myself but things are going great.


One of the problems men face is that they hide their humanity, and then unveil it to those who have accepted them as a robot. I have a great difficulty getting other men to listen to me when I say this.


There is something quite unintuitive in the fix. We need to wear our humanity on our sleeves, and tank the face rejection from people who don't like men being human beings instead of a Man Archetype. We will repel these people, and it will hurt. What you don't see when this happenes, is that if you hid your humanity for years then unveiled it, they'd reject you then anyway.


The love, respect, adoration, and so on we may receive for wearing the mask of A Man is fake. It's not for us, it's for our character. A character we can't even take pride in having created, for we plagiarised it from their expectations of us. The only way to be loved for who we really are, is to be who we really are. This is what ""be yourself"" means. It doesn't mean ""if you be yourself, you will get everything you want"" it means if you lie and manipulate and falsify to get things those things are not for you, but if you are yourself only the things that are for you will stay.



Now, as for the ways men are valued for their performance, understand evaluating our worth from others is fickle and detrimental to our wellbeing. Of course, it can be deeply internalised. It's pretty ingrained in western culture that men are providers. Men are attractive when they are successful - as a contrast to women being attractive when they are youthful, for example. 

The answer is to become self validating. To build trust in yourself, to develop your own values. To detach yourself from our cultural influences to decide who we are. This is actually one of the advantages of being autistic I believe - personally I spent a lot of energy trying to fit in and be normal, but the second I let myself just be me I saw how lightly social pressures really affect me. One path towards understanding yourself in this area is to figure out what you want. Write it all down. Then determine which of these things are expectations set by society (e.g. wife and kids), which are set by a culture (e.g. be like X to attract a partner, have X job by Y age), which are set by parents, and which are set by you.",videogamesarewack,False,1715862446.0

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pressure and uncertainty, especially with such a significant financial burden looming over you. It's commendable that you've chosen a career path in dentistry out of genuine care for others, rather than solely for financial gain. However, it's crucial to consider the long-term impact of such a hefty debt and how it might affect your personal and professional life.



It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and question your choices, especially when faced with such daunting challenges. Remember that it's okay to seek support and guidance during difficult times. Have you considered reaching out to a financial advisor or counselor who can help you explore your options and develop a plan to manage your debt responsibly?



Additionally, finding a balance between your career aspirations and personal life goals is essential for your overall well-being. While pursuing your dreams is important, it's also crucial to prioritize your happiness and fulfillment outside of work. Don't hesitate to take the time to nurture your relationships and pursue personal interests, even amidst your academic and professional pursuits.



Remember, you're not alone in facing these challenges. Many others have navigated similar paths and found ways to overcome obstacles.

1ct0gzw,I saw your other posts and I get where you’re coming from… you look absolutely fantastic but it’s body dysmorphia. I have the same issue as a frequent gym goer and it sucks!,unlikelyduck116,False,1716231096.0
1ct0gzw,"I’m not sure, I struggle myself in this area, but as a man, and an individual, my preference and enjoyment in a woman’s beauty is not “thin”. I try to avoid women who are-so because it is as unattractive to me as is being obese. 

I feel like there is a sweet spot where women look incredibly beautiful somewhat outside of the term ‘thin’ and closer to the word ‘curvy’ and the guys I tend to chat with agree with that to at least a 95% rate.

But, that is the current beauty standard of most men in society right now. And your question is how do I change my own beauty standards and feel like I am enough, beautiful, and pretty.

For this, it’s much more complicated. I suppose in little tiny ways you should look to try improving your self esteem. Instead of focusing on areas you have a lot of shame about, try finding at least one asset that you believe holds beauty. And every day spend time admiring it and enjoying it. If you can, try seeing if you can add another. Write poems and love notes to these areas of your physical beauty.

After you feel pretty good about that, and once you find yourself thinking and enjoying these areas daily, (and after feeling you exhausted all the areas of beauty) start trying to find neutral areas and repeat the process. Think about how they help support the things you find beautiful about yourself and how they themselves may be beautiful in ways you hadn’t thought of before. 

Try occasionally  Asking people you trust what physical feature or asset they find to be your most beautiful and enjoyable asset to look at, ask them why, and see if you’re ever surprised by their answers. Then write love notes about it regardless of if they told you something new, or not. See if you can include the ways they viewed this feature in the love notes.

Self love isn’t something you can just fall into tomorrow, but it’s something you’ll be not so good at some days, and better on others. It’s something that takes a whoooole lot of time too, so don’t feel you need to rush it or push yourself on days that self love feels really hard, instead on those days try doing stuff for you that is kind but doesn’t contribute to thoughts or feelings of beauty or lack of it and just try enjoying yourself. Some days we end up being meaner to ourselves and getting frustrated so try being self-aware so you can avoid those pitfalls on worse days.

Look up other ways too for increasing self-love and finding new ways to appreciate or build a sense of worth within yourself. You are much more than your beauty, so enjoy what and who you are. ❤️‍🩹",Bassdiagram,False,1715823010.0

1ct0gzw,Stretch marks dont destroy your body in any way. They are just marks. No person will think they take away from your looks. However I can't seem to really understand the insecurity itself. I have self harm scars from top to bottom alongside stretch marks from bodybuilding. The self harm scars are just signs of the struggle I've overcome and the stretch marks show the progress I've made doing bodybuilding the same way your scars represent progress from an unhealthy weight to a healthy one.

1ct0gzw,"Both anorexia and your current situation are rooted in self hatred /not being good enough. The root cause is oftentimes children being scolded for things they don't understand. If they're left to ""figure out what they did wrong"", theyre go-to solution is ""something about *me* is bad"", which then results in a decreased self-value. The severity and coping mechanism depends on your environment and character. 

In order to heal from that therapy is necessary (either alone or with a professional). If you want to look into it on your own, here are some youtube videos I found helpful:

1ct0gzw,"Thank you so much. I know I’m technically in that sweet spot, men approach me and everything, but I just still have the anorexia nervosa thoughts, where I need to be as thin as possible. I find myself consuming a lot of media of models and such where they are all like bmi 16, and it’s so hard not to compare myself to them. I know I shouldn’t care how they look but the disorder gets in the way of rationality sometimes.

A big problem I deal with is people assuming I never struggled with eating because I’m healthy now. They just have no clue the thoughts that go through my head on a daily basis, and the hours spent body checking. Weight gain doesn’t make the mental illness go away, it just heals the physical body. And I wish people stopped saying otherwise, because it perpetuates this idea that people who are under bmi 16 are the only ones who have anorexia. Which just isn’t true. I just manage mine because I value a fuller life than one taken over by malnourishment.",Working_Trip4696,True,1715873359.0

1ct0gzw,"I’m sorry to hear this dear. When you put things this way, I can understand how frustrating and painful it all can feel, and I’m sorry that you’re not only dealing with your own internal struggles, but social ones too.. I think you should try communicating your others that you still have the anorexia mindset even though you chose to prioritize the health and wellness of your body over the impulses and desires that the thoughts and feelings wish for you. 

I didn’t really talk about my severe depression ever, but when I started talking with my mom occasionally, she started treating me more kindly and gentler now that she understands better, my dad as well but I never spoke to him directly. I can’t promise everyone will be understanding and accepting, but the ones who love you and trust you the most likely will, and for me it brought a lot of relief and a sense of support. 

I’m sure you also know, but if you can you should avoid that kind of media (models and BMI stuff). I had a similar thing, it was something that I went and pursued nearly daily and every time I would, it would end up hurting me more and wildling me down and causing more anxiety and emotional issues in my life than the boon and temporary enjoyment of consuming the media. Although, I can imagine looking at that kind of media likely no longer brings you any joy. 

Anyway stay strong!! I’m super proud of you for the choices you’ve dedicated yourself to so far!!! It’s super super difficult and I think you are very brave and strong to prioritize the difficult option. I hope you find lots of ppl who support, love, and accept you as you keep working towards self love and away from self hate. 🧡",Bassdiagram,False,1715890793.0

My cognitive empathy could use some work sometimes. generally I'm okay at reading people but I find it hard to deal with sarcasm and ""reading between the lines"".

1cszrcf,"I think there are three types of empathy. 

Cognitive - where you can intellectualize the feelings. Like reading it from wikipedia.

Affective - I FEEL what you feel, maybe this is long talks in the car and story swapping, maybe even trauma bonding. 

Compassionate - probably focuses on actionable empathy. This is the one that kinda requires that 3rd party between yourself and your future. ""Not that you believe in yourself but you believe in someone else that believes in you."" Healthy social validation that can transform feelings into the future. 

  
From my experience those with mental health conditions but are still functional have high cognitive empathy. But struggle with affective empathy. They are somehow emotionally blocked from experiences beyond the basics of common social graces. Or when things get emotionally deep there is a defense mechanism or fear that is unhealthy that presents itself. 

Also more emotions just manifest and become more complex as we age and as we experience life too. When you are stuck in a PTSD phase or afflicted with a condition that keeps you emotionally stunted or arrested in development you can have gaps in many feelings. 

Again much of this goes back and forth of what is functional and what isn't functional in society.   
I could say that narcissistic attitudes are the majority of first world emotions in ""functioning adults"" till like 30-35 and after they struggle with developing and filling out their emotional spectrum.
