1cvl7au,"I can relate to a lot of what you said. Reminds me of my psycosis. I'm not sure if that's what you go through but it's part of what i deal with everyday. But like me it seems like you have a good intuition with your mental health and I thinks it's good that you can see the signs of decline. Even if you didn't go see a Dr. And you just came on here, it's good. You are seeking help either way. Idk what to really say I've been having a really hard time myself and I almost went full tilt delusional last Tuesday but my mom snapped me out of it and she took me to her house for the night so I could destress. So seak your supports (people who care about you and that you trust). Honestly sometimes just having someone to just have a real conversation with that isn't the most superficial shit ever is enough for me sometimes. I hope this helps somewhat I know it helped me typing it. I'll try and keep a look out incase you reply.",Vegetable_Echidna_21,False,1716131929.0
1cvl7au,"I'm managing but I don't wanna keep all this shit inside anymore. Honestly I came to reddit just to vent about my hallucinations but I couldn't even post what I wanted to anywhere for some reason. At the same time I say I don't wanna keep it all inside its not all I wanna focus on. If something comes up it's different. But as I was typing my initial reply the hallucinations subsided.

1cuh1to,"Everything about this post is weird, down to your name. Wtf? Mom o moaning? I have experienced sexual assault in my own family so I can attest to the effects of grooming, manipulation, and gas lighting minors. You ma'am have been all three and more. There is no way a normal child in their teens would ever think or even consider this abnormal behavior from a parent, okay. She abused you. Mentally, emotionally, and yes...SEXUALLY. Penetration isn't necessary for assault. Forcing you to remove clothes, sniffing your under garments, her removing clothes and rubbing her body on yours in any way, shape, or form IS ABSOLUTELY Sexual in nature. She is gaining some sick gratification off of these experiences just like a pedophile or peeping tom do. I'll give you an example of how bad this is and the early signs.

My niece is 5 years old. I met her when I moved in with my sister when she was mere months old. My sister was hard working and busy all the time at work while her husband took on a stay at home dad role. We'll one day I was baby sitting and was changing my neices diaper when I noticed a odd red spot around her private area. I was like 🤔...But I brushed it off as maybe a diaper rash or my sister or brother in law wiped her too hard. Days go by, maybe weeks, I don't recall. All I know is sister was at work and I was home with my brother in law and neice. I heard strange noises coming from his room. Baby was crying, but it sounded different. I couldn't believe what I was hearing...and then it stopped. I thought of that red spot and immediately thought ""omg, could this be real?"" Anyway, I called my sister and told her, I don't know what happened in that room, you know your man more than I do, but please, never leave him alone with her again. I gave her my reasoning and she sounded like she knew what I was talking about because she didn't ask many followup questions. It was fucking weird.

Anyways, fast forward 4 years later and he has been arrested for child sexual abuse, not from my niece, but from his teenage daughter from his past relationship. My point in saying this is, my niece is traumatized at 5 years old and she doesn't even notice because she's so young. She has no idea what her dad did to her but yet she knows her dad's in prison. My sister strangely allows him to call her and talk to her as well. It quite frankly pisses me off. He calls her and says ""daddy loves you, I miss you, etc...and she says it right back to him as well, unknowingly still being manipulated by the man that assaulted her most likely for years. Her behavior is strange for a 5 year old as well. She hates wearing clothes. Loves running around in underwear and asks to go out in town like that as well. Stuffs her shirt with stuff to make it appear she has boobs. Wears my sisters high heels and steals her make up and literally tries to appear beautiful....now I get it, little kids do this...I get it. However, with her past, my sister shouldn't be allowing her to do this, but she does, and it's sick. Both her and her daughter need to seek therapy.",Mindweav3r,False,1715995956.0

1cvu4k6,"Hi, I'm sorry you're going through all that. It sounds like too much to take. 

I'm not sure I understand what exactly your mental health problem is from the description. If it's not too triggering, can you describe these hallucinations or the symptoms that are the problem? 

Also I don't know how it works in your country. Can your gp prescribe you medications that would help like Pregabaline or some antidepressants?",AntonioVivaldi7,False,1716143872.0
1cvu4k6,"I see. First, maybe a lower dose of Quetiapine would be better? I was on it for a little while too and had to lower the prescribed dose right away or else I wasn't able to function. 

I'd say I understand anxiety well as I recovered from terrible GAD and OCD. I don't know if you're familiar with how you're supposed to work with it. Do you know exposure therapy? That's what you need to be doing in order to make it better. 

And I'm not sure what to thing of those hallucinations. Usually when people experience hallucinations, they don't question it at all. They take it as if it's really happening. I'm wondering if these are more of visual phenomenons similiar to what I was experiencing at one point. For example seeing a clearly bright smoke when I turned off the lights. Or as if the floor was moving.",AntonioVivaldi7,False,1716144827.0
1cvu4k6,[deleted],,False,1716145263.0
1cvu4k6,"I recently explained it to someone so I can just copy it here:

First, it's important to establish that all anxiety, no matter what it's about, is coming from having low tolerance of uncertainty.

ERP (exposure therapy) is about exposing yourself to your fears on purpose. If you do that, your brain registers there was nothing to be scared of and that will make the fear weaker.

With thoughts it's trickier. Scary thoughts such as intrusive thoughts or simply about how something bad might happen or already happened demand a clear reassurance from you about how it'll be fine. But by seeking this reassurance, you're further lowering your tolerance of uncertainty, making the anxiety worse. That's why you must stay in uncertainty about your fears on purpose and that way slowly become comfortable with it. And a great way to make it easier and shut down the rumination about your fears is acceptance approach. For example if you start thinking something bad might happen, tell yourself it might indeed happen and leave it at that. Add it's fine if it happens. This allows you to adapt a sort of ""whatever"" mindset about fears and your brain will throw that specific worry out and also slowly stop bringing such thoughts on your mind to begin with.

At the same time don't search for how likely or unlikely is it to happen, otherwise this doesn't work.

And overall it's important to not be in your comfort zone too much in terms of avoidance. Meaning don't avoid specific situations, people or triggers in general purely because of anxiety, because that way it the comfort zone shrinks. While getting out of your comfort zone on regular basis expands it, making you more comfortable in general.

Also it's important to keep in mind how because all these fears are coming from the same place, confronting one fear will weaken other fears too, even though they're otherwise not related at all. So it's worth it to be confronting all fears, not just the main one.

And with the feeling of anxiety for no apparent reason, meaning the feeling of dread or doom with no specific trigger, you must not try to make it stop in any way. Also at first it's good to focus on it, as if it's a quiet sound you're trying to hear. This way you will build some resistance to it in just few seconds, making the anxiety from it weaker. Then you should carry on with whatever you were doing, but still not try to make it stop or distract yourself. As if it's something you have to tolerate being with you. This way you keep building resistance to it, which also carries over to the future, making the future attacks weaker and less and less frequent the longer you do this.",AntonioVivaldi7,False,1716146573.0

1cvhyxf,"Hey, you are doing okay. This is okay, I promise.

This is not a problem. Of course people would be weirded out if they found out and yes you feel like you have to stop but just can't.

Things happened and you can't take it back. If you put your shame aside. Didn't you enjoy that? Are you sure that you're not suppressing a part of you that is vital to you?

You don't have to beat yourself up over a preference like that. It could be very harmful for you to be ashamed so much.

I don't know how else to express it. There is a reason that fetishes exist and it is a way for you to express yourself. Just because it's demonized by society doesn't mean that it's bad. And please learn to believe that.

If you want to stop because of your own morals, then that's okay. If you don't want to stop because you personally see nothing wrong with it, then that's also fine.
But if you want to stop because of shame, while at the same time still enjoy it and want to do it, then it creates internal conflict and it might destroy you.

We held this position when we were in our mother's womb, it is a secure position. You also want to wrap yourself up in the sheets that are in your bed and curl up into a ball, I noticed that it calms down quickly. Or take a hot bath, it’s comforting. do you have a pet ? Or you can watch guided meditation videos on YouTube which will also comfort you. Repeat positive affirmations to yourself and tell yourself that everything is temporary. Pray for what you don't have and show gratitude for what you do have. I hope these few tips will help you feel like me. Good luck 🫂🫂💙 ",ScaryAssistance7103,False,1716153321.0

1cv65qc,"Yep. This is actually a universal experience, I also have this. I can have periods of my life, maybe a week or so, where I think life is great, and I hang out with friends but I'm not ""manic"" I'm simply a ""normal"" person enjoying life with minimal amounts of stress and worries. Then however, overnight I can go allt he way back down to the bottom and just want to lay in bed and not feel like anything. Often this is due to added stressors in my life, or simply just burn out. Burn out can be from doing too much in the ""good week"" and not having enough time to decompress and recharge your battery. Because of this, you drain all your battery so low without the opportunity to recharge your batter that it takes longer to recharge it from 0%. 

&#x200B;

A way that has helped me with this is not over doing it during the ""good days"". Don't do everything and anything when you feel good (even though you might want to) because it leads to burn out and then again, the cycle goes where you then just need to recharge. It's kinda like making sure your phone doesn't go all the way down to 0%, instead you try charge it till it gets to 50% or 80% and take it off the charge, use it and then recharge it before it gets too low on battery.

Also, if cheese or other toppings wouldn't be too heavy for your stomach, green apple slices topped with Cheddar cheese slices, or peanut butter (and maybe some raisins or chocolate chips), or dipped in honey could make a bit of a change.

And as for crying,screaming etc.,I was asked as a child whenever i cried “do you want me to give you something to cry about?!?” & it didn’t take me long to realize that I absolutely did not want that. And now as a an adult even knowing that crying is actually cleansing and can take a weight off so to speak,I still find it so hard to cry. And it sucks. So please if you feel the need to cry,or yell,or punch something (pillows work well for me) don’t think anyone would think less of you. Even if they do forget them.

1cv3236,"You know what normal actually is these days? ""Normal"" is just one of few personalities born of the internet. So many people have no original thought or personality. They just think and believe what the internet tells them to.

But hey, if you want to be normal so bad you do have some choices...

You could be someone who thinks 80% of the men you encounter are dangerous and out to get you and not realize that its a phobia and that most of the men are actually decent guys who are trying to live their life like you.

How about following one of the ""rolemodels"" who would have you believe that most modern day women are shameful and should be secluded to their homes and subservient to men and focused on providing them with children.

Maaaaybe you'd prefer to be ""woke"" or a conspiracy theorist. There's some truth in those types but there's also so much crazy delusion mixed in that you'll never figure out what is true.

You could be gay and leave the rest of your personality in the closet. Then build your entire life in a way that ensures your sexual orientation is all people will ever think of when you're in their life.

You could quit your job and become a sex worker on OnlyFans. (Honestly I've been considering this myself but thats just because I fkn hate my job).

I hear being afraid of change and rejecting all inconvenient truths is popular amongst old people. It must be pretty fun making sure everyone knows just how much bs modern science is.


I could keep going but I think you understand.
You really don't want to be normal and being different is a good thing! Embrace your uniqueness, weird traits, and eccentricities. Take pride in the fact that you are different. A lot of people won't vibe with you but the ones that do will be the best people you'll ever know!

idk what you meant by “minors” but if you meant like a kid that could be in highschool i dont think this brings you to a “pedo” level. (or even the technically correct name of whatever the group is thats attracted to post-puberty teen) 

from the age of 18-20 you go from being a person who is freely allowed to think about romance and sex in a “teen” capacity to all teens being taboo and forbidden. lots of people deal with a stunted emotional and maturity development due to screens and home environment. its not so crazy to be a 21-23 year old who sometimes finds themselves thinking about a 15-17 year old. I AM NOT CONDONING SEXUAL ACTS WITH A MINOR. im just saying it doesnt make you a bad person for simply having those thoughts. theres no magic switch that gets flipped at 18 or 20 that desexualizes anyone younger. 

if you were fantasizing about younger kids? well i guess it depends on the nature of your fantasy. were you trying to actively think about an adult man/woman and your brain kept taking you to a more taboo scenario with a younger kid..did you immediately feel disgust and shame when that happened and try to pivot away? 

the more taboo the more exciting the more our brain tries to chase that feeling. im not justifying it im just saying theres a difference between someone whos sexually attracted to kids and someone who falls into a brain loop of the taboo scenario. you can go from fantasizing about a cute highschooler in a cheer skirt( IN YOUR EARLY TWENTIES WHEN YOU FEEL YOUNG AND LIKE SHES BASICALLY YOUR PEER) to a younger kid. 

BUT in my experience there is no thrill in fully rolling out the taboo scenario. when i was going through this i saw that door opening and immediately slammed it shut because it creeped me out and i didnt feel a “desire” to pursue it. do you feel a desire?

one thing i definitely noticed for me was that when i was around an actual child? these thoughts never occured. i never got sexually turned on by seeing a real life child it was the taboo of the “daddy” kink that broke me. is that you? teach your mind to see the boundary between roleplay and reality. 

the fact that you havent had these thoughts and now just look back with shame tells me you probably didnt and dont. you were young and likely selfish and your world was only you. pray if you need to pray. give if you need to give. forgive yourself for crossing a line younger you never thought was possible. journal and cry and scream and then burn the paper. let what was be and move forward. 

you never touched a kid and even if it feels like apart of your soul will always be blackened because of this, the fact that you never brought these dark thoughts to realization is crucial. it is what saves you. we all have demons in our heads.

1cv28rz,"You right. The truth of the matter is no one cares, or they begin to care less overtime if the issue stems from your mental health. 

My take: every person walking down the street is ""crazy"" in one way or another. Everyone is dealing with something or many things to a certain degree and becomes debilitated to a certain degree because of it. There is a very apparent stigma that still exists in the mental health world, and people would rather hide what they go through forever, than admit it to themselves or anyone else. Lots of factors like pride, shame, guilt, hypocrisy, denial, or just general lack of awareness. This stigma will hang on for dear life until the boomer gen has passed and the gen behind them as well.

I flunked out of college over mental health and not taking care of it. Went from straight A's and perfect attendance, to straight never going to class, never eating, and sleeping everyday for almost a whole semester, a complete shutdown. The shame/guilt over that took almost 8 years to process out of my thick skull. The things we can go through are undeniable and much more debilitating than back pain for a temporary amount of time.

My advice is to never expect anything out of the world around you, because at best, you'll be severely disappointed out how cruel and lacking in compassion everyone is.

There’s a lot you can do so that you’re not “white-knuckling” your way through life. A lot of it boils down to perspective and how you choose to view things. I personally struggle with the concept of fairness. In my simple mind, things should be 50/50 give and take or close enough to it. Not the reality of the world, so it’s something I have to be mindful of and work to improve on. Little things add up, and before you know it, you’ve become negative or pessimistic in general. Best thing you can do is do everything you can to be as self aware as you can be. Read up, do research, talk to people, whatever works. The knowledge is out there.

1cuzz54,"hi! that sounds frustrating. it seems like you are both maybe suffering from assuming the other person will fix something that bothers you without communicating the extent to which it bothers you, or communicating it clearly? I could be totally wrong, so I'm sorry if I am, but here is what advice I'd offer. if you already do these things, just ignore me. :) and maybe try couples therapy. having a mediator is amazing, and it's not all crying and vulnerability, sometimes it's fun.

when you have a calm, neutral moment, tell her that it upsets you that the only time she seems to remember not to do things that hurt you is when you say it. tell her the things she does that hurt you, and ask her if it would help her if you calmly pointed them out when she does them. let her know that you don't think she's evil, but that she may not realize how often she upsets you. it may seem like common sense to you, but your brains don't work in the same way, you don't have the same thoughts and emotions. I know it's frustrating, but I find reminding myself of that really helps me deal with others. remind her that you are a human and that we all need love and support, and let her know how she could show that to you.

ask her to communicate the same to you-what things you do hurt her and why. ask her to gently remind you when you do those things, and not to assume you know every time because, like I said, you have different brains, different thought patterns, different emotions. ask her if it is really the games that bother her, or if it's your behavior outside of that too. sometimes, people pick one thing to freak out over, when what really bothers them is plenty of other smaller things. if she felt loved and supported otherwise, she would have no problem with you gaming.

remind each other of the things you love about each other. remind each other why you put effort into the relationship. remind each other regularly. communicate to each other ways that you would like to be reminded. :)

easier said than done! I know whenever I have big conversations like that with my partner we usually end up crying, but it feels so much better afterward. communication should be strong, not just bare bones. try to process your anger before talking to her, and not during. you should express that you're upset, but getting heated isn't going to be helpful there.

as for her substance abuse, let her know that it concerns you and that you're ready to help when she's ready to stop. this is a whole other issue, and even though I've dealt with a lot of addicts in my life, I feel very ill equipped to offer advice more than that.

All emotions are there for a reason even if they don’t all feel pleasant. Maybe there’s some stuff you can unpack with a therapist. Medication I will say allows for treatment like therapy to work better for many people. If you’re mentally more stable (chemical wise) the work will be easier but that’s not to say working on yourself is easy because it is the complete opposite. I’ve been through many kinds of treatment but until I was diagnosed with bipolar and FINALLY being on the right medication allowed me to fully absorb the information I was receiving. I recommend therapy before seeing a psychiatrist though. Not all things can be fixed through medication, though it does help.

My happiest times have been when I focused on helping others and eliminating selfishness, self-centered behaviors, dishonesty, and fear.

1cuz6uf,"I just watched a video about how some old human fossils were found that suggested that skilled surgery was used to treat an injury. The story was that the ancients may have been more crafty than we realized, but what I found more striking is that there was a community that cared for an individual enough to amputate a limb, help them recover, and thrive for years. 

No medical system, no office job, just some wild humans caring for each other. Perhaps the system we live in, the world we’ve built, has gone astray from our core human-ness. I think we are naturally caring about others - to a degree - but the world has twisted us into something else. 

Where I live, everything is a commodity. Even hobbies for fun are supposed to earn money. When we can’t even enjoy ourselves without having to earn money, that can make people sad, angry, anxious, or desperate. It can lead to competitive behaviors instead of communal ones. And caring gets lost as we devalue people who maybe aren’t able to be productive. 

The ancient humans didn’t care about productivity so much. They just cared for each other. I’m not sure how we get back to those roots other than to fight against the system and form our own communities. Which may be harder for some than others. I’m able bodied, but my mind is not in a good place. I’m fortunate to have some really good friends, but even they cannot break my mind of it’s depression. Because they are caught in their own trap. 

What I know is this: there are small pockets of people out there, fighting for a tiny piece of community. Urban gardens, book shops with readings, LGBTQ organizations trying to foster support and care. Small bands of misfits roaming around trying to form community in a world that is built to destroy it. 

We are all worthless in this system the moment we don’t serve a purpose. And that’s going to make everyone crazy. Cause irrational behavior and wild, contradictory thoughts.

We are not tools to be used and thrown away. We are living creature that need nourishment and connection. We are social animals who thrive on being part of a group.

I would often come to a party after closing up at a sub-shop (making sandwiches) smelling like food, and they would make fun of me. Everyone would already be drunk. I was tired, but I wanted to hang out. 

I didn't go to any ivy, but my hard work paid off. I have a home in a coastal town in Southern California, considered affluent. My wife has had the luxury of being a stay-at-home mom for 15 years. I've had flexible jobs with little or no commutes to spend a lot of time with my family. Sometimes I feel like I could have done more with my life financially if I sacrificed my time with the family, but I don't regret my decisions. 

I didn't have any close friends outside of the fraternity circle. I mostly hooked up with sorority girls. I didn't really date because I had no money. Although my fraternity brothers made fun of me, there was still love. They understood my situation, and it was half-jokingly. But it still kind of hurt knowing that they probably thought that they were better than me because I was a service worker. I don't really keep in touch with them anymore. Most of them still live where they grew up, either got mediocre jobs or are working in their family business.",cahrens2,False,1716043699.0

1cuy5ww,"No. What you’re describing is a cognitive distortion called personalization, thinking everything is your fault. But it’s rooted in a negative sense of self. Thinking things are your fault. Thinking you’re always messing up. Thinking you’re the root of all evil in the world (not literally). 

You are right in acknowledging that narcissists think everything is about them, but the key here is a sense of self grandeur. Narcissistic think everyone thinks about them the same way they think about themselves: superior. That sense of self importance has to be paired with the inflated sense of self in order to qualify as a narcissistic trait. 

So you thinking “i must be a narcissist because when people are hurt I think it’s my fault” is the exact tell to know that you’re not. A narcissist would see someone hurt and not even consider that it was their fault because in their minds they can do no wrong. 


In general the running joke is if you have to ask if you’re a narcissist, you’re probably not. Because narcissists have no realistic sense of self and rarely ever see their issues.",Konjuress,False,1716043236.0

Some are less capable than others and some have other agendas that make navigating them harder whether they apologize for things or not.

1cuxl1a,"About your guilt: You need to see the positive side of how you see error, of what it means to make a mistake. Error is not something to be hated. When it occurs naturally, it is a blessing in our lives because it means that our consciousness has had to adjust to learn something new that it didn't know before. It makes us better! Therefore, enjoy making mistakes more and be happy when you benefit from it. Forgive yourself. Don't carry guilt. You did the best your previous consciousness could. You don't need anyone to forgive you. Never want that. Never. Some will never forgive you as not everyone is a mature person. Therefore, never be hostage to the need for others to forgive you. This will bring you no benefit or peace. Instead, forgive yourself!

About your shame: It's one thing to realize that you're destroying your own world (your relationships, your friendships, etc.), and then to realize that you made a mistake, feel a little guilty, forgive yourself and move on.

Another thing, completely different, is shame (it has nothing to do with realizing your mistake. It serves no purpose. It hinders you). It reveals that you are wanting to be accepted and well-regarded by people in society, even if unconsciously. However, wanting this makes you a slave. Don't try to be someone else to please society, because that, at one time or another, will destroy your path, which is unique. If you ignore your personal destiny, you will live a life of pure dissatisfaction, a life of pure suffering, where there is nothing but rottenness and affliction of spirit.

Your path is to form a positive version of yourself, a version that delivers more purpose and happiness in your life. And it is not possible to reconcile this with society. You can't do this by wanting to fit into society, because in society there are also many people who are following their own unique paths, and you could never assume such different identities on different occasions to please them.

People need to understand and accept your unique path, your originality, no matter what it is. If they don't accept it, this will be a nuisance that they will have to seek psychological help to deal with. It's not your problem. What is not in your control you should not worry about. Be happy if you ever see that they are uncomfortable. This in a way gives them self-knowledge for themselves, like a gift that you give when you live.

There will be times, perhaps, when you feel embarrassed when you see a pretty girl. You want to impress her, and shame signals that you want to simulate a different and pleasant personality to her, to be accepted. This is another human error. If you do this, she will meet someone else, not you. You probably won't be together for long since she's never met you. In this specific case, you need to think like this: ""Want her to adapt to you. Want her to seek acceptance by you. This way you will maintain your own individuality. If you think like this, you will be doing the right thing.

1cuvw8g,"I’m sorry to hear this. There is a lot of emotional abuse from your mother to you. It’s good that you have a therapist to work through this with.

Sometimes there are other things that make you more susceptible to weight gain. 

You can definitely work on these things to help. I’m sure if you asked others you’ll find them to have positive remarks.",,False,1716034814.0
1cuvw8g,"First of all, I’m glad you’ve got access to medication for your ADHD that is supporting you with your studies. Appetite loss is extremely common when experiencing ADHD, and medication often makes this even worse for people.

If it’s a possibility, it may be worth seeing a doctor to get some basic blood tests done to test your nutrient levels and your heart. The physical sensations you described are all very common when your body is deprived of food for long periods of time- regardless of the intent behind restriction.

You’re right on being concerned about how your past and the relationship with your mum may impact your food intake and weight… that is a huge risk factor in developing an eating disorder.

As someone who had a severe eating disorder for almost a decade, I want to urge you to get some support as soon as you can. The longer you let this go on for, the more it will ruin your life and the harder recovery will be. Early intervention is the key to success and the literature backs this up!

You may find it helpful to see a dietician or nutritionist who is able to work with you on slowly increasing your food intake, whilst also working in with your other neurodiverse challenges that may make eating extra hard for you. 

I would encourage you to increase your food intake slowly- not only will this help you tolerate the feeling of fullness better, but if you go from not eating anything to eating lots really quickly, you are at an increased risk of refeeding syndrome and/pr electrolyte abnormalities.

I also wanted to flag that once you do start eating more, it is very normal to find that you become ravenous and want to eat lots. That’s your body’s way of protecting you as it’s not sure when it will get the chance to eat again (it thinks you’re in a famine and will take any chance to eat whilst it ‘can’). Listen to your body as much as you can- it knows how to heal itself, and it knows what weight you function best at.

Finally a few of recommendations to leave you with- 1. Chuck out the scales, 2. Set reminders on your phone to eat throughout the day, 3. You may find it helpful to eat foods that are high in calories, as you don’t need to eat as much volume to get all of the nutrients you need, 4. Please reach out for extra support if/when you need it- I can’t stress to you enough how important it is to address this as soon as you can. You deserve to recover and you deserve to have a peaceful relationship with food and your body 💖",Hot-Alternative-7367,False,1716036627.0
1cuvw8g,"Yeah I’m gonna try to gain some weight, currently focusing on small snacks frequently to build up to a meal because big portions make me feel terribly ill.

1cuvw8g,"Thank you very much, I’ve made a plan to eat a little but a lot because three meals a day has become very daunting and makes me feel really nauseous. I have a phobia of needles so a blood test is terrifying to me but it’s getting to the point I have is making me question putting that aside, asking a friend to hold me down (like my mother normally does) to get it done. I have started taking vitamins to get my iron up because of the little I’m eating so when I snack I’m getting more nutrients than I used to :)

I think my mum has heavily impacted my relationship with food in ways I’ve spoken to her about but she’s never acknowledged. Even when she said I lost weight I still felt frustrated y’know. 

Thanks for all your tips and reading despite your past with eating disorders, it is a reason I’m concerned to talk to friends about it (most if not all of them have a history of being sectioned for ED or have had severe cases with it). I really appreciate you reading despite how much text there is and giving your advice.

1cuu502,"Craving junk when you're hungry is most likely because you're not eating enough calories or nutrients. 

Your body is in need of a quick energy, which you can often times find in foods that are high in carbs, fat and sugar, which most times junk food is. 

Depending on the type of junk food, it could indicate that your body is lacking in a certain nutrients (e.g. bread = carbs (quick energy), greasey food = fat (need more long lasting cals), chocolate = sugar (low blood sugar), salty food = low salt (can lead to dehydration)).

If you want to stop craving junk all the time, you need to eat nutritionally balanced meals, ensuring that you're eating enough calories without top high of a surplus (unless needed for weight gain). Don't stop eating junk altogether cold turkey, it can lead to a binge and restrict cycle. It's best to lower it over time, and cut it out eventually (if you wish to reach that point).",Fancypotato1995,False,1716032130.0
1cuu502,"If you've got poor mental health, or your under stress, you'll desire junk food because it's usually quite flavoursome and it makes you feel somewhat good.

The only way to beat that cycle is self help. Don't buy junk food at all, remove the temptation. If it helps, you can experiment with new recipies to take your mind of stress. 

Your body needs nutrients and vitamins and balance. Try and have balanced meals with Fruits, Vegetables, Meats, Carbs. If you fancy a snack, try stuff like fruits or yoghurts.  But if you've eaten junk food for a prolonged period, you might have stomach issues because your body won't be used to the sudden influx of vitamins and nutrients, it won't last too long.

If you can make it past all that, you should be able to kick the habbit. Hope this helps.",BlueKnight0604,False,1716045736.0

For a while I thought it was because as a man, I supposed to chase women, cry and make songs for them (in my country is common) but my sister has had a similar issue with her apparently psychopathic ex-husband. In my world, I cannot conceive how a female would be afraid of breaking up with her bf, we all know that any female (reproductively healthy) speak out and  will get 1000 guys queuing  for her, meanwhile your bf might take long time begore getting another, it is like that, so he knows that, you know that, why to be afraid.

Finally, what i say to myself is this, we all were born alone and will depart alone, everyone is temporary, and he does not belong to you, you do not own him, what you have a flimsy agreement that at least each of you will not romantically engage with other people, in a fair pact, what is the same to you, it should be the same to him.

HE WILL LEAVE YOU, one way or the other, tomorrow because he feel attracted by a younger woman, or after 50 years because of a heart attack, it does not matter, so why not just prepare yourself for that ""fatidic"" moment and enjoy the few time you have left, learn to appreciate the time you spend on each other and avoid the dramas.",Double-Membership-31,False,1716028650.0

1cus4e3,"I get where you're coming from my friend, i too get very angry when driving. I think it's the nature of the act itself, you are confined to the rules of the road inside a moving metal cage while stressing to get to work or wherever. It makes you anxious in it of itself.  Buying a gun to solve this problem, sounds like an exaggeration, though i do not live in a place where people with guns roam about. As long as you are driving according to the laws you are in the right, but also accept the fact that lots of people on the road act like assholes. And not everyone drives perfectly.  Best you can do is protect yourself.   
Try to ignore the ones that bother you and keep at your way. Yelling and lashing out is not a solution and is not benefiting anyone. 

Try to think realistically of the situation everytime you get annoyed. What has really happened? Is it anyones fault?   
How do you avoid this situation next time? In my experience, driving calmly and collected and being clear about your intentions, is the best way to drive, and most people want to avoid conflict as much as you. 

Οn the anger issues, as far as i know, your emotions stem from you. Everyone faces annoying situations on the road. Maybe sit down and think of what actually made you angry at the moment? What is it that you think when someone shows you they think you drive too slow? (Maybe you take some things too personally) Is it really something to be angry about?

I’m assuming you graduated college? High school? Regardless, congratulations! It’s a lot to go through and a lot of people don’t complete it, myself included. What you are feeling is tough for sure, and hard to understand for a lot of people. The general numbness you’re describing happened to me as well. A couple things you said that I try to touch on briefly. Life goes by fast. The last big birthday is 21, next thing you know, you’re 30 and scratching your head wondering where the time went and it keeps going faster and faster lol. As you become an adult life changes rapidly, you get busy and take on more responsibility and time has a funny way of flying past without you noticing, that’s pretty normal.
Something else, we have very little control over life and it’s many outcomes, don’t stress it. The only thing you have control over is you, your mentality, and your choices, that’s it. Everything else is beyond us and you’ll go mad trying to dictate outcomes and scenarios and the people around you.
Being anxious is also very normal, but most people don’t know how to deal with it long term. My advice is to just be mindful and self reflect often. We become the people we are for very specific reasons. What helped me grow as an individual was thinking about everything that caused me stress in a more analytical way. Ask yourself questions, try to identify scenarios or events that hurt you in the past, identify root causes, improve from there.
I don’t know your family situation. Hard for people to face it, but biological families for A LOT of people can be extremely toxic. It’s not easy to deal with at all. You grow up around these people, and lean on them for advice and support. But there comes a time where even they can be the source of great turmoil that will warp your perspective of yourself and the world around you. If that’s the case, let them go. Life is too short to spend excess energy on people that can’t reciprocate the energy you give them, even if they are blood. That is the toughest lesson to learn, but holds up.

As far as advice on doctors and therapy. Do your diligence to find a good therapist if you have the means. If not, a trusted friend that can be objective and respect your privacy and opinions. Doctors are a sore topic for me so I can’t give good advice on them (15 years of mental health experience from age 13 and on). Some are helpful, a lot are con artists selling meds they don’t understand to people that don’t need them and give you more meds to cope with side affect of previous meds.

You got this, you’re human, this is normal, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Real change comes from within, perspective is key.

Hope this helps! Reach out if you need.",obscureproducer4725,False,1716094363.0

1cupfj2,"(Answering to one of your comments) First, SHE lost her dignity, not you. A woman with no dignity has no power on your self esteem. Yes, she might have “robbed” you… but this doesn’t mean she won. She lost a gentle and kind person to get a man who acts like a kid, cause only in elementary school I saw people getting fun of another kid for their appearance. This is a kid thing. No responsible and mature adult would ever do what they did to you. They aren’t mature, they can’t think like proper adult people do, they are useless in your life.

I know you can’t fully hate a person you loved a lot, I know the sensation. But you need to understand that sometimes change is necessary. Also remember there’s a limit to helping someone. You have the right to say no, you have the right to live your happy life and not make another person life happy. Either it’s both or nothing!

I’m not saying you made a mistake, because I think this is an experience a lot of people go through, and of course it’s not your fault if someone is no brained and extremely rude. Just learn from this.. And, no, the lesson is not “everyone will trick me, everyone is rude”.

It will take time but you’ll be able to trust someone again and find another person that’ll make you happy. Believe me when I say this! I experienced it myself. It’s never easy and happy all the time, there surely will be many more rough times for both of us, but life is not made only from bad things!

As another one here said, if you can afford it and if you want to, a therapist would be a great option to recover quickly. And it’s also good to have someone to talk to, have a safe space, since you said you’re scared to go outside.

After you build your new safe space at the therapist, or wherever you want, you can start going to the park, take a short walk, stay active…

If you still don’t feel like going out, you can always refer to an online therapist, there are a lot of apps that allow you to talk by your home with one of them. And they are also cheaper! (But, saying this only for your happiness, this should be a temporary option, then you must go outside.. you can always have an online therapist and another one outside of your house)

One important thing to remember: “…use all of your energy to build your future, not to destroy your past…”

It’ll be okay soon. You’re not alone; you have me, you have all of us, but most importantly, you have yourself. And I honestly don’t think yourself, which is incredibly kind and rare to find in this world, deserves to be judged at a mirror, or by everyone else.

Try everything to keep yourself out of the bed unless it’s time to sleep. You can try to make your bed after you wake up so you won’t want to go on it and ruin it, for example. If you can afford it, and want to, buy some mental health activity books. There are some that do actually help a lot.

If you feel demotivated to do anything, try Finch; it’s a mostly free app that lets you organize your tasks while you grow a little, adorable bird that’s always by your side.

When that feeling of depression becomes an extended amount of time, typically longer than 2 weeks, is when it may be time to start considering that you're not just down and out but are you suffering from the actual condition of Major Depressive Disorder. Other signs and symptoms can include anhedonia which is just the fancy word for not finding joy or enjoying the things you know you like to do. Loss of concentration, focus, loss or increased appetite, interruptions in sleep like insomnia or hypersomnia, overall depressed mood, feeling irritated or agitated more than normal, fatigue or loss of energy, having thoughts of hopelessness and worthlessness that may include suicidal thoughts whether those are passive (don't contain a plan or intent) or active (includes plan and intent.) If you feel you've been experiencing some of those symptoms for more than a few weeks, it may be best to book an appointment with a therapist or mental health provider to get an evaluation done and find some clarity about it.

1cukeor,"I was like that too. No, you are not a psychopath. I know this because psychopaths don't think about making posts and don't even have 1% consideration for things.

What happens is that your emotions are very undeveloped. Part of this is lack of practice (having a strong desire to be emotional about things, watching drama films to force yourself to be emotional helps - Be sad, cry with joy, feel sorry, etc., basically being emotional about everything helps you develop. This will improve over months and years training).

Another part of the puzzle is that you suffered a lot and ended up learning that feeling emotion hurts more than it does good, and this closed your heart to protect yourself, possibly from the many traumas of your past.

A third part, which is also about development, is that you need to feel the love. I'm not talking about liking someone, not even falling in love (which anyone can do), but rather a feeling of love. I thought it wasn't possible, but I found a way to start feeling it. However, I don't know if I'm able to describe how to do this, as it's very abstract. However, look at mothers who feel love for their children, as most womans start feeling love when they have a child. 50% of the world's population has never felt love, so don't be surprised when they tell you it doesn't exist. I also thought he didn't exist.",-ZaneTruesdale-,False,1715992509.0
1cukeor,"It could very well be that you never had the chance to deal with the weight of the sexual assault. Trauma like that can make it really hard to feel any sort of anything. You should consider speaking with a therapist or counselor to try and healthily deal with the trauma. Either way what happened doesn’t make you a bad person considering you needed to grow up and be resilient so young.

1cukeor,"I'll try to show you the way I felt love for the first time. You'll know you've felt it when it feels like a little stronger liking, like a strange new sensation feeling like a different little pleasure. Then you will perhaps feel the air in your lungs becoming hotter or colder, or you will feel something burning in your chest.

1- Close your eyes, concentrating in silence.  
2- Imagine in your mind the person you like most. It's easier to love who we like.  
3- Imagine her smiling at you. Sympathize with her, empathizing with her smile, as if you feel her joy.  
3- Then, feel as if you want to be inferior to that person (as if you want to feel inferior to that person). This is an extremely important part. You cannot love someone if you cannot feel humble and inferior to them. For the same reason, Jesus washed the disciples' feet, humbling himself. As if you see this person as an innocent child of yours who needs all your care and love. Tell yourself: ""my dear son/daughter"" if necessary. I frequently do this.  
4- Then, decide with conviction, within yourself, that you want to love and feel love for this person. Because the love is a decision! It doesnt happen naturally.  
5- Now, breathe deeply throughout the process, and with each exhale (release of air through the nostrils), you will send love to that person. Intuitively you will have the feeling you are sending, even if in an imaginary way. Feel as if it were possible to send your love to her (just feel as if it were possible, as if you wanted to send your love).

Keep trying until you succeed. The reward will come.",-ZaneTruesdale-,False,1715993403.0

People tend to put too big goals in front of them in situations like this and once the motivation fades after a week they fail and fall back even further. Try to set small goals and try to be better just a little bit each day than you were yesterday. 

You can for example put goal to exercise 3 times this week. When this becomes a habit after couple of months proceed to next goal. Dont be impatient it takes time to see results and trust me it will pay off greatly.

Social interactions are also something you can learn, I used to have big anxiety when talking to people or when I went out but over time it got better to the point that I’m often the most confident person in group.

1cuh1to,"I am so, so sorry you have had to go through this. And for what you are going through now.

As someone who has been in an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship, but did not understand it until a while after I got out, I relate to the confusion you are feeling. And the minimizing/justifying of her behavior... You remember now what happened. You feel it, and understand it. But your mind isn't able to accept it yet, and there is this massive confusion between the image you had of her, and the image you now see. They cannot exist at the same time, and it causes emotional chaos. It may feel like you are about to implode, and like you want to bang your head against the wall to get the feelings out of you. 

I know it doesn't seem like it now, but it will get better. Once you are able to accept what happened, you can process it. It takes time, but you can get through it. You do not owe your mom anything! Yes, she sexually abused you. And your dad enabled it, because he didn't stop her. It was sexual, there is no other reason. People excusing sexual abuse using other reasons are lying to themselves, because they cannot accept the truth. Just like you are doing now, to protect yourself. 

Use these answers to get confirmation. Read what you need to read. But seek help from someone with understanding of this type of trauma, cause this isn't something you should try to go through by yourself.

It is difficult to acknowledge it as SA because, one, your brain is protecting you, two, its extremely difficult to see your mom as an abuser since she has done other ""motherly"" things that she ought to do like feed you, cloth you, educate you, etc. Just try thinking about it from this perspective: would you still not call it SA if it was done to you by a stranger?

When SA takes place at the hands of people who claim to love us and often have done other things which fall in the realm of things people do to people they love, its very difficult to differentiate the abuse and love. But let me tell you all of it is manipulation and abuse. Love is nothing like this. People don't abuse the person they love in any manner whatsoever.

Sexual abuse comes in many forms. You HAVE been sexually abused and mentally abused consistently! I am so sorry you are confused about this and what it actually means.

The problem is that you are constantly fuelling negative thoughts by repeating them in your head and trying to justify what happened. The way our brain operates is different and the thing is “what you run from ends up chasing you”.

Two days ago I purchased very famous book on amazon called “Overcoming unwanted intrusive thoughts by Sally M Winston” and read it 2/3 and it completely changed my mind. It teaches you technique how you should not try to avoid or justify intrusive thoughts because they end up just getting worse and worse but instead you should learn to take power from them by recognising them as just thoughts and eventually they will fade away or they will not bother you at all since they are just thoughts (we have many thoughts in day that we forget because we don’t react to them since they are not important - the issue with this is your reaction).

My partner would try to talk to me about music and I wouldn’t want to engage because my meds had made it so I couldn’t feel the music anymore.

1cuda92,"Hello, first of all I’m so sorry for your loss. What you’re experiencing genuinely is one of the worst feelings in the world. Grief for a dog is so unique because of their intense loyalty and positive presence they provide. There isn’t much you can find to replace it.

I lost my childhood dog of 14 years 2 years ago. It was the worst experience I have ever been through. Worse than the deaths of family members worse than breakups just horrible. My dog was my comfort from a not so stable home life. When I noticed him getting sick I didn’t wanna believe it. After a visit to the vet I spent half a week giving him IV treatment in my room and feeding him by hand trying to keep him alive until he eventually passed while we were laying down together on my floor. Afterwards I was grieving and furious cause none of my family or friends cared about his passing and I spent many weeks in bed skipping my college classes and drinking all day long. 

I literally do not go more than 3 hours without thinking of him to this day. I sleep with his plush Lamb Chops dog toy every night. His death was a big reason actually for why I initially started going to therapy which has been a huge help in all of this and more. But the only tangible relatable thing I can tell you, is this will never go away. Especially that empty feeling you perfectly described. 

One of the few things that got me through the chronic debilitating grief was remembering that loving feeling. Right now I don’t think I’ll be able to get another dog again in my life, however knowing that such a special relationship existed in my life, during my childhood especially, is something I am so grateful for. It got me through so much. 
That’s what I would advise for you. Be grateful that you experienced such an intense and true love from your dog. Cherish that relationship. Even though she is gone the memories of her love and care are still there. Those memories from my dog give me hope that there is true, unbiased, unmotivated love in this world and hopefully we can pass on just a small fraction of that to the people we encounter. 

PS: There will likely be people who try to, but don’t let anyone try to make your dogs passing insignificant. Like I said for myself it was worse than any other tragic event in my life.

1cubleb,"Hi.  Lifelong psychiatry patient here, over 25 years now.   I've also been addicted to Xanax three times, by three different psychiatrists.   

This is a subject I feel qualified to comment on, I'm saying.

There's a couple things that jump out to me.  

1.   Your psychiatrist (or other prescribing professional) MUST be involved in your psychotropic meds.   The fact that you are trying to be deceitful here, or game the system, or somehow bypass the safety controls in the system says a lot.   I'll let you make meaning of it, but it is a huge red flag.

2.  Going into a prescribing relationship with the attitude 'I must have drug X' is also concerning.   Your provider does this all day long.   They have literally seen your case a thousand times or more.   They know what drugs and doses work, and which ones do not.   If Xanax is appropriate, they would prescribe it.   

3. Last one is a piece of advice, that stems from my experience.   If you want to subvert the system and get prescribed drug X, the best way to go about it is definitely NOT to ask for it.   In fact, that is 'drug seeking behavior', which is always suggestive of addiction.   Do not ask for a specific drug.    Instead, mention the specific symptoms for which a short-acting anti-anxiety medication is most appropriate.  

4.  Things have changed over the last 5 years.   Controls over psych meds have become much more severe, at least in my state.   The days of breezing in and out with a script for 360 1mg Xanax are over.   (Those days did exist, I'm sad to say.  I was there)   I'd adjust your expectations.

I have weekly therapy that monitors my mood and checks for changes and that doctor has full permission to contact my current psychiatrist. He can even contact my psychiatrist without telling me. I also have psychiatrist visits every 1-3 months, depending on status. There is significant oversight for my condition as I have a high stress job. I have also had a mental hospital stay, yet again they did not think it would be removed. After a long observation, I believe it would have been removed if an issue. 


Benzo meds also have been used more recently to treat mania in bipolar people. It is significantly less damaging than other meds I take, and uses a different pathway than my other medicines. It has helped me control manic episodes and I feel no high off it. Consider that I would need to raise my depakote or Lamictal levels or go back to rhisperdal. Risperdal is terrible to be on and the side effects were unbearable. Basically, I've worked for years now to come up with a cocktail that can assist in controlling my condition. Xanax (for me) doesn't pull the handbrake like rhisperdal, but it does let me have time to contact my doctors. 


Also remember Xanax is the safest benzo, the amount to off yourself is quite high. You do lose the ability to drink, which I'm fully OK with. You will become physically dependent on it (not the same as addiction) which is obviously worrying. You should avoid it if you have an addictive personality, which I don't.

The loneliness is downright crippling at times, but I have a lot of trauma in my past, a lot of it around my own sense of value and worth in relationships, that makes it really hard for me to connect with people that way, so it's the hand I was dealt.

It's great that you have family you can lean on in that way (I don't.) Even if they're not the most fulfilling relationships, you'd be amazed how much you can miss just interacting with other people when that stops being the case, so I'd suggest being thankful that's there.

I wish I knew some advice to give you, but clearly it's something I struggle with as well and if I knew how to fix it I'd have done so for myself. The only thing I can think of to suggest is that maybe you can't rely on other people to initiate with you, and need to start initiating more yourself?

As for hobbies and stuff, maybe check sites like Facebook or MeetUp and see if there's any groups in your area that do these things together? Maybe that will at least help you meet some people you have things in common with, and hope something sparks.

I think it's phenomenal that you realize how much effort you put into yourself as far as your appearance and hygiene, because at the end of the day, taking steps to take care of yourself are so, so so important. On that same note, part of taking care of yourself isn't just limited to your physical appearance- it's also about taking care of your emotions, feelings, and the needs that accompany them (aka, your brain! Take care of your brain, too!) This may tie into your feelings of loneliness and lack of self-confidence. Remember, we live in an age where loneliness has become RAMPANT, because of social media, smartphones, etc. Maybe reflect and ask yourself if endless scrolling is contributing to your feelings of loneliness or being disconnected? Even a quick, three-day experiment of pulling back on your digital usage could be enough to help you figure this out!

These things collectively could give you a great start to start combatting these feelings. But remember, it WILL take time.

But you need to consider what that means as well. You’re right, medical bills and debt are a factor. You will be forced onto psych based medicine (part of what you consent to when you sign up for it)
You don’t know how long you’ll be there. Average for a lot of folks is 3-7 days, but you’re under the “care” of the psychiatrist that is assigned to your case. You’re not coming out until they think you’re no longer a danger to yourself or society.

1cubceb,"Assuming here you're in the US:

It is so much better, you get treated better and have more rights when you admit yourself versus being admitted ""against your will"". So unless you're about to do something you'll probably regret, check yourself in as a voluntary patient instead of an involuntary patient. Telling your doctor or therapist that you are going to...yourself will likely get you committed as an involuntary patient, that should only be reserved for emergencies. It's a legal thing. As involuntary, you are not allowed to direct your care or check yourself out without a judge giving you the okay. It's similar to being arrested (unfortunately no joke). 

Anyway, there are a few options to get a stay in the mental hospital:

If you have health insurance, call who covers your mental healthcare, sometimes under ""behavioral health"". Ask what providers are in your network. If you're not currently seeing a psychiatrist, you're going to need one. Say that it is urgent and if you can possibly get a sooner appointment. A psychiatrist can then arrange an inpatient stay when you go to your appointment. If you already have a psychiatrist, you can ask for an urgent appointment, and again, they will probably recommend a place and send a prior authorization for you to go there. Insurance usually wants authorization first, because inpatient stays are expensive. The doctor has to fill out a form saying an inpatient stay is necessary. But it's similar to getting a hospital stay for anything else, like getting your appendix out. You then check into the psychiatric hospital that they referred you to.

If you're uninsured/or underinsured, look up what your county hospital/hospital district is. This is the public hospital that gets funding from grants and tax money. Sometimes you can even find the psychiatric hospital/unit that they run. Sometimes called psychiatric emergency services (like an ER but for mental health). You can either show up there and ask to be admitted, or if you can't find what their psychiatric unit is, just go to their regular emergency room. You will get evaluated by a psychiatrist on call and really stress that you need an inpatient stay because you, ""fear for your health and safety"" or something along those lines. Since you showed up there yourself, you will likely be admitted under voluntary status.

(These hospitals won't cost as much but they're also not very nice places in general). I got my bills written off in 7 years with only some dings to my credit score. They pretty much assume people going there can't pay their bills. 

Then there's option three. The nuclear option. Involuntary status. Call 911 or any suicide hotline and tell them you're ready to do it and you have a plan. Police and an ambulance will come to your house. The paramedics will do a quick check of you, and transport you to the nearest emergency room (no, you don't get to pick under this scenario). Maybe you will go in the back of the police car in handcuffs. It depends on how polite you are, and how the first responders feel that day. Ambulance rides are nicer but way more expensive. The cop car is free, but you're going to be handcuffed. Then they'll admit you to the psychiatric department through the emergency room. They're not allowed to experiment on humans, but they are allowed to give you whatever treatment they want as an involuntary patient, unless you're allergic to it. That means if you have depression but they want to say you're psychotic, they can give you anti-psychotics. If you decline treatment, they will say you're non-compliant and being ""combative"", even if you're totally polite about it. It's their word against yours, and as one intelligent nurse said to me, ""who's going to believe you? You are the patient"". Thus, you are the crazy one. This is how most people end up in the psychiatric hospital, so you're not alone picking this option. But bless your heart, it's a miserable ride. 

I've done all of these myself, and I would highly recommend the first two over the last option. But the last option is a guaranteed way to get that ""psychiatric holiday"", maybe a court mandated 90 days of it. No, they don't care if you have rent, a job, or pets to feed. They're locking your ass up with the last option, but it is keeping you safe when you are a harm to yourself. Hopefully you have a responsible person who will feed your cat and keep you from getting evicted if you pick option 3. I would totally go voluntarily. You can still stay and get help, get stabilized, get caught up on sleep, separate yourself from your toxic environment, whatever you need. A voluntary stay can also turn into an involuntary one if you say certain things (I think you know what they are- directly threatening harm to yourself or others). If you have insurance, I would start by calling the behavioral health line. It's usually answered by a real human 24/7.

Laws differ from state to state, but each state has its own variation of a specified timeline for voluntary hospitalizations where you must be released unless your case is going to be taken to court and the judge will extend your stay. Here in Illinois, it’s 5 days. 3) you can still join the military. You will need your recruiter to file a waiver on your behalf. More than likely the waiver will be approved. You can also have a government job as well as be a LEO with a psych history; however, there are certain barring diagnosis such as schizophrenia for obvious reasons. 4) Federally, you can buy and own firearms granted that you were not involuntarily hospitalized or adjudicated as mentally defective by a court (this is straight from the 4473 form). State laws are different and may prohibit ownership or conceal carry for a certain period. Illinois requires a firearm owners identification card (FOID) to own firearms and its also needed for conceal carry. The FOID card gets revoked with any kind of psychiatric hospitalization and there is a ownership prohibition period of 5 years from the last hospitalization. This is different in states that do not require any kind of licensure for firearm ownership. 5) it is highly illegal to deny housing or evict someone based disability including mental illness.

Just so you know, there is a significant difference between voluntary and involuntary hospitalization. I’ve seen commercial pilots, train conductors, police officers, and active duty military personnel who were hospitalized and continue to be employed in their respective fields. Only certain jobs require that you disclose any mental illness or a hospitalization. Otherwise, this is information is protected federally by HIPAA (assuming that you are in the US). You can request for a doctor’s note for when you miss work that mentions that you were hospitalized but does not disclose the type of hospitalization or the reason . If your employer does find out, there may be restrictions placed on your duties. These restrictions are usually temporary.

But once you there, just ask the psychiatrist if you can become voluntary….. they can switch it over up until you get on a court order or possibly discharged first….keep asking daily… in my case over 30 hospitalizations, simply asking to be switched to voluntary works 50-80% of the time. 

Involuntary court orders are put in the Law Enforcement Information Network…. My state police will send a letter explaining that you’re not allowed to purchase fire arms. 

Another option is go to what’s called a freestanding psychiatric hospital not connected to another hospital system…. They typically do their own evaluations and let you be voluntary….

1cub05m,I can't really speak on the rest but what your dad does to you is in fact abuse,Itsmetheotherjacob,False,1715974874.0
1cuabxi,"Hi there,

First, let me just say how incredibly brave and strong you are. Opening up about your feelings and experiences, especially during such a challenging time, takes immense courage. It's okay to feel scared and disconnected right now—what you're going through is a lot for anyone to handle, and it's natural to feel overwhelmed. I want to validate your feelings because they are completely understandable. Breaking up after a decade, especially with children involved, is a significant life change. On top of that, you're dealing with pregnancy hormones and the complexities of maintaining a stable environment for your kids. Anyone in your situation would find it difficult to cope.

It's wonderful that you've taken the proactive step to get therapy. This shows just how much you care about your well-being and your family's. Sometimes, though, the road to feeling better isn't straightforward, and it can take time to find the right balance and strategies that work for you. Feeling disconnected and like life is moving too fast is something many people experience in times of great stress. This sensation, often described as depersonalization, can be frightening, but it's also your mind's way of trying to protect you from overwhelming emotions. It's okay to feel this way, and it's important to be gentle with yourself during these moments.

You are not alone. Many people have gone through similar feelings and have come out stronger. It's important to remember that there is light at the end of the tunnel, even if it feels far away right now. Self-care is key, so continue to focus on your mental health. Whether it's through therapy, meditation, gentle exercise, or simply giving yourself permission to rest, taking time for yourself is crucial. Reach out for support and lean on trusted friends and family members. Sometimes just talking about your feelings can provide relief and make you feel more connected. Celebrate small victories because even getting through a day or managing to complete a simple task is an accomplishment, and each small step forward is progress.

Try to find little moments to connect with your unborn child. Simple activities like talking to your baby or playing soft music can help foster that connection. Remember that feelings of disconnection and fear are not permanent. With time, patience, and support, you will find your way back to feeling more like yourself. You are doing an amazing job under incredibly tough circumstances. It's okay to feel what you're feeling, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it. You have so much strength and resilience within you, and brighter days are ahead. Keep being kind to yourself and take things one day at a time. You've got this.

Sending you lots of love and positivity.",Ok_Obligation9737,False,1715971006.0

Everyone feels anxious or sad or has a bad day sometimes or have things not work out well, but that doesn’t mean it’s anxiety or depression or trauma. There’s a difference between normal emotions and life ups and downs and actual disorders and trauma. The main things I do to help myself are with creative outlets. I guess what I hate the most is not being normal whether it’s with being trans or with PTSD. For example especially dealing with things intersectionally: if im dealing with someone that’s casually and blatantly transphobic that triggers my PTSD(cause I’ve had security called on me for being trans multiple times(but had PTSD before trans issues too)) I’ll start trembling and then said person starts talking about not being emotional…you can’t be hateful and expect people to not be upset and people act like they would support people with PTSD but then when I have symptoms they’re freaked out. It makes me feel terrible and weak.

1cu97wu,"Dang this strikes a chord with me for sure, and I wrestle with this concept all the time! You're not alone in this, I get what you're feeling to a relatable extent, and thank you for sharing.

  
I share these diagnoses and have a very similar perception where I just don't really get people anymore. I will never understand how people would want to be treated well or good by others, and then turn around and treat others in a demeaning or hurtful way. I'm very empathic and try my best to always put myself in someone else's shoes as a means of trying to understand and level with others. I grew up in a very abusive household and hearing raised voices is a trigger. I just wish people could understand the gravity of what they say and do in everyday life and understand how it affects people around them and themselves as a whole. Many nights laying in bed, staring at the ceiling lost in thought over this kind of stuff.

The only advice I have for you is based on my personal experiences and I'm not a doctor or medical health professional in any capacity. I went off medication a while back, and it was terrible for 6 months. 2-3 weeks of physical withdrawals and several months until I could find my sense of Normalcy. I made it through to the other side and feel like a person again, not numb to all the BS happening around me. I made a choice, and I chose to face problems rather than take Med and do therapy and hope things will get better. I want to make it clear that this isn't a judgment, more rather a sentiment to those who go through struggles like this. If the Meds truly work for you, keep on keeping on. In my experience, 15 years later i realized they were a big factor in how i felt and viewed the world around me.

Perception is key! The world will always present a set of scenarios that you will feel some type of way about, every day. Me mindful of your thoughts and trust yourself. It gets better when you learn to look at things from a different view.

1cu879v,"It’s a complicated issue isn’t it? My old man and most of his family is this way, and I can be too at times. The way I look at is if you try to understand that person from your sense or point of view, you’ll always be confused. Looking at it from their experience and point of view is very difficult as well. The best advice I can give, don’t try to make sense of it at all and just learn to deal with it or distance yourself. I don’t know how old this parent is, or how old you are, but if you are a legal adult and have the means to leave, do it. 

My reasoning is that these people are typically “blissfully unaware” of who they are as a person. They are empathetic, so they see themselves as good natured. They actively block out the negative traits they have. If they become aware for a second how destructive they truly are, they completely implode. So they become masters of deceiving themselves without even realizing it. What I’m trying to say is they could say awful things to you, try to break you down, but will subconsciously block out that experience so they can carry on. When my mom was diagnosed with brain cancer, my dad screamed at her white in the face everyday until the day she passed away and he literally couldn’t anymore. While it was happening and even days to weeks after it happened, he has no recollection of any of it, like it never happened.

It sounds harsh and it sucks, but if you don’t want to become this you have to leave asap. If they can’t come to terms with themselves, you can’t make them either. Cut your losses, heal the damage, and try to carry on. No sense in going down with the ship.",obscureproducer4725,False,1715962334.0

If you have to talk to a doctor to achieve this, tell them about insomnia and nothing else. If you don’t have any sort of a healthy sleep pattern, your brain can and will play tricks on you. It, like everything else in your body, needs to rest adequately and consistently to function properly. Unless you want to be in a psych ward or be a life long experimental medication consumer, DO NOT tell a medical professional about the hallucinations. If it gets to the point where your hallucinations are telling you things or instructing you to hurt yourself or others, that is the only point where I would cross that line and “get help”.

The second portion about emotional intelligence I can see your point depending on how you define emotional intelligence. In the past (and still to some degree now) I have struggled with having too much empathy. I can’t shut it off, it’s literally how I’m wired.

The easier it is to be anonymous the more people let out their true feelings and some people are just terrible under their masks of niceties. While you are looking for genuine socialization others are looking for a power trip. Try to focus on people that don’t take themselves so seriously and don’t feel the need to be above others or put people down or anything like that. You can’t always predict whether someone is going be nice or not cause empathy is conditional; they might be super empathetic to one person but terrible to you. It’s not as straightforward as it should be. Lots of cognitive dissonance.

News articles baiting engagement by saying something that sets people off in their title is an easy and simple example, but overall most people seem to have a knee jerk reaction to seeing people being themselves online as the worst possible interpretation of it.

There are some communities that are diehard about being positive, and those are typically more safe (though not totally safe), and at times like these it's probably best to avoid the internet as much as possible.  If you still end up online, interacting with spaces like that is probably best.

I'm kinda going through it right now too.  I'll chat with someone in a friendly way online and they'll take it as if it's some kind of personal attack and start slinging insults back and a bunch of people will side with them and gang up.  It's a magnet for humanity at its worst.

But people aren't that way normally.  The internet draws the worst out of us and it's not accurate to how everyone really feels.

Self-hatred is an internalized belief system which is often formed at an early age as a child's primitive attempt to reason and rationalize traumatic abuse and/or neglect. A child's reasoning capacities are not fully developed and the child can interpret abuse/neglect from caregivers as if there is something personally wrong with him/herself. Young children absorb experiences like a sponge and they go directly into the subconscious mind where they form the foundation of their psyche, so even negative programming from outside sources such as media and entertainment can be internalized on some level. Gabor Maté has done great work on this subject.

Overcoming self-hatred involves surfacing and challenging negative, harmful subconscious beliefs about ourself (CBT is good for this) and learning to forgive oneself for our perceived shameful wrongs or deficits and, ultimately, develop compassion for ourself.

Honestly, it starts with therapy. They will help you out the most with that, but from what I learned from my therapist is that we're hardest on ourselves more then anyone else might be. 
You just gotta start being easier on yourself. Redirect hurtful thoughts by questioning it or distract yourself. Even dunking your face in ice cold water for a few seconds, or taking a nice bath or shower could help the thoughts are too much.

It's a lot of practice on self care that gets you there. It's rough, but it gets easier. Just keep practicing mindfulness over thoughts, asking why you're having them or even if they're realistic to what you're going through",Clown_Juice711,False,1715951917.0
1cu1mof,"I've been working with a therapist and feel my self hatred stems from a few things as a child. One was my Mother always expected perfection when it came to my school work. So anything less then 100% or A on a test I would be moved to tears because I was unable to handle it. I also feared I might be hit for not being the best of the best.

Meanwhile my brother was a complete piece of shit who bullied and abused me physically and verbally for years. I understand it came from a place of jealousy and feeling like I was the favorite son. But due to all that abuse I wound up really hating myself - my looks, my personality, etc...

Now coping with it has been and is still a very hard thing on a day to day basis. I try to do things to make myself feel better about me like working out, trying to eat healthy but indulging when I can from time to time, and sometimes just doing mirror talks with myself. 

They basically equate to the comical Stuart Smalley SNL skit of how he would look in the mirror. I give myself positive affirmations about ""you deserve better then how you feel about yourself and your a swell guy, believe you are.""

It's really not easy to tell you the truth. Anytime things go sideways life wise it's very easy for me to fall into a bit of pit of feelings where I will get down on myself. I shouldn't.

As if you want to those bad feelings to come. And hold this for like 15 seconds with your full attention. Then carry on, but still don't try to stop it. Let yourself be anxious.

What I can say is as not only a healthcare worker but someone who follows combat footage (a similar sensory input) it will wear you over time and you very much will need positive outlets to decompress that stress. I have found my life is more peaceful and healthy feeling when I moderate the level of perception I have for stressful/traumatic input.

Sometimes it helps to think of it with other common experiences instead of you directly in the situation that's causing your anxiety.

4) Then you ask yourself the most important questions of all: Is it worth it? For me, I apply the situation and think out the worst end it could come too, in my case, committing suicide. This can be hard for a lot of people, but really put yourself in that scenario. If you're like me and suicide is your one solve all (I hope you're not like me). So for context, I play out my funeral in my head. I imagine people that were close to me and care about me and the great amount of pain it would cause them. I think of people that may depend on me and how it could impact them. I think of my mother specifically, and as painful as this all is, Its enough to snap me out of a dark place every time. Deep breathing helps while you're doing this because its not fun and your heartrate will elevate even if you're not going to the extreme I do. 

I just want you to understand a few things. Feeling emotion is normal, acting out based on emotion is problematic. The healthcare world at large wants you to be medicated, and nearly all medications available are experimental and not tested or designed for use past months to a year. Don't consent to a lifetime of being medicated over being anxious or depressed for a period of time. Its normal, shit happens, that's life. Meds will hurt you 10x over in the long run and make a mountain of a mole hill. Whatever is messing with you or your mental, face it head on. Everyone has the inner strength to overcome any obstacle if they so choose. 

I believe in you and all of us. Hope this helps.",obscureproducer4725,False,1715960816.0

1ctwz00,"Thank you for sharing! What you’re going through is tough, and hard to look past at any point. It’s normal to feel how you do. For example: when I was your age, was with an amazing woman for 3 years. Life pulled us in very different directions and although I would have done anything to maintain our relationship, She was the wiser and decided we should move on. What I’m getting at is this is not uncommon, and you won’t forget the real ones. She left a mark that doesn’t come off and while it can hurt it’s not a bad thing. I think about that woman still from time to time and I’m in my late 20’s now. What I would caution you on is this: 

Don’t let the negative emotion surrounding the loss of someone that meant a great deal to you make other problems that didn’t previously exist. Life is very much so how you choose to perceive it. It’s very easy for a young man to lose themselves in these situations. Be strong, pick yourself up, and understand that it’s very normal and very HUMAN to feel this way. There’s no timeline of getting over it, and you never truly 100% get over it. My advice in the short term is to just stay busy. Sounds simple, but just keep moving and fill your day with meaningful tasks! Stay away from drugs and alcohol. Self-reflect often and be aware that not everything will work out how we envision it, most things don’t. You’re young, seems like you got a good head on your shoulders, and a bright future ahead of you. Don’t let this event determine the trajectory of what should be a long and fulfilling life.

This is yours to go through in your timeframe. Eventually you’ll be okay and begin to feel occasional joy and you’ll laugh a little. Bit by bit you’ll integrate this loss into who you are. Hopefully you’ll learn about yourself, make some changes and maybe you’ll find someone new, and better yet you’ll learn to enjoy your own company.

Relationships in general are extremely tough, and take a lot of understanding, compassion, and understanding for both partners to share mutually. It's extremely easy to fall into the mindset to where you don't feel understood or your needs aren't met, and start to villainize your partner, especially in a something legally binding like a marriage.

If you want my honest take that is only working off of the details described in this post: You need to be aware that your partner is struggling too. You mentioned a list of things that hurt you, and mostly negative things about the partner. There's a lot going on, but don't ever underestimate how someone begins to feel when they care about you but are also being blamed at the same time. Turns into a spiteful game where everyone playing loses. Unless this guys was a dumpster fire of a man when you met him, he probably is scared/frustrated and doesn't know how to express it.

For example, there is evidence that only 30% of soldiers exposed to identical phenomena will develop symptoms associated with posstraumatic stress disorder. 

There are also broader factors involved with mental illness, such as coping strategies, problem-solving skills, social support, and more. For example, an internal locus of control, which is something that you self-describe, contributes to positive mental health and resilience. 

Potentially, maybe some have it better off than others in these regards. I don't necessarily think it has to excuse behavior, but it may explain it. And there may be a very small minority who do abuse the system, which gives it a bad name for people who are struggling. And there are certainly degrees. 

I'm a psych nurse and so have seen people who are severely ill. It can sometimes be harder to see it as an illness in those suffering from less severe or non-psychotic symptoms. I'm not sure if this is helpful.

If that scares you or disturbs you in any way, you can always figure out another physical way to release that negative energy. For example, you can force yourself to go on a walk/run. You can join a boxing gym and take your anger out that way. 

And yes, part of what you are dealing with is a learned behavior pattern; however, it is not who you are. So with practice, you can stop responding with aggression.

It's just exaggerated because chaos grabs attention, and it drives ratings... But it can also depend on what you click on... Whatever you click on, just know that these Social Media Casinos are going to continually feed you more of the same bullshit, and make it addicting (like gambling) at the same time. The more doom scrolling you do, the better..  Sometimes I click on something, and it opens the door to more negative stuff.  I'm also speaking from the fact that I'm subbed to the r/PublicFreakout  and r/ActualPublicFreakouts subreddits 😂🤦🏼‍♂️ Those subs can make you really not like people.

1ctoix7,"I go through this myself. I think you should start by educating yourself like listening to podcast or YouTube about how to deal with procrastination. Try to see what will work for you then coordinate around that. I would also say get a notebook or journal that you can brain dump in. Try reading. If you don't like reading or is hard for you to read,  start with books you like. But if that doesn't work neither try audiobooks, your brain collect the information the same way it would if you were reading the book.  This is good for your brain & is also a form of meditation. I would also say you should find a form of meditation and this can be anything and anyway just something that helps put your mind at ease. Take walks even if it's short ones or do yoga or deep stretches. Try cold showers. Drink lots of water & try your best to get 8hrs of sleep, this will help a ton!

If you think about offending your therapist too much you may not be able to get the most out of therapy as you could if you were open.

1ctmlga,"Loneliness was my greatest fear for most of my life.  Honestly it's still probably my greatest fear.  I feared friends and family moving away and leaving me alone, and I feared the loneliness and insecurity of living on my own if it ever came to that.

When I was 24 (I'm 32 now), I lived on my own after a breakup, falling out with my family, working a terrible job that consumed all my time, and living alone far away from everyone.  I lived out my greatest fear and it WAS bad....

...but not because I was living alone, but because it was a perfect storm of shitty situations.

Since then I've lived alone more than I've lived with others and realized that it's not so bad.  You get used to it, and it's not as lonely as you'd think.  We're good at adapting, and I tend to visit friends on my time off when I feel the need to see people and I spend time online a lot now, which kind of helps mitigate that feeling of loneliness.  Most of my contact with my friends is online too so it's not like it's just complete random online strangers every time.

In recent years I've had to learn to get out of my shell and seek out new situations with new people more, and with the help of therapy, that's been going great.

We're good at adapting, and as someone who lived out a worst case scenario, I can say it's not so bad.  Now, I kind of fear having roommates because I feel like I'd have the added pressure of being a good roommate to them, which I don't have right now with anyone.

I suffer from complex trauma due to childhood neglect and my anxiety was so bad sometimes the only ‘solution’ I saw was to stop living - which I did not want. I wasn’t suicidal, everything was just too hard to bear. 
So last year I started antidepressants and honestly I feel like it’s the best decision of my life.
I don’t see them as a source of shame, or a ‘band-aid’ for being weak, but as a ‘teacher’ for my brain. It’s not because you start taking them, you’ll take them forever! I don’t know if you tried getting off them with medical supervision, but it’s normal that you experience more stress when getting off them, because the amount of neurotransmitters in your brain are suddenly different.

In my opinion, depression, anxiety or any other mood disorder is an illness just as any other, and sometimes that needs a multitude of treatments to get better. I think my meds are making new pathways in my brain so I can work on myself and find the things that help me, without getting so paralized by my anxiety that I just can’t do it. Once I feel I have my toolkit ready and feel like I know how to deal with life, I will slowly get off them. 
So that’s how I feel, I hope this counts as advice? Eitherway, there’s nothing to je ashamed of, you are just treating an illness. It’s not because it’s ‘in your head’ that it’s not real! Good luck :)",SLLIHHARAS,False,1715890081.0

1ctjjzx,"Don't think about giving up. 
My heart goes out to you, sounds like you've had the terrible luck of just meeting terrible person after terrible person.
You are much stronger than you are giving yourself credit for, to have come through all that and still be moving forward ..... well, you are obviously a pretty amazing strong person.
Your Social Worker, abused your trust and his position. Regardless of anything you did/started/offered, he was assigned to you to help and knew exactly how you were vulnerable. And as such anything that occurred was not in any form or fashion your fault.
As a child, I was abused and for years felt guilt and shame for years. But then one day, I found how to disconnect myself from those feelings and place the guilt where it should've been all along.
I'm not saying for one second that my experiences are anywhere near the nightmare you have lived,  just saying be gentle on yourself and no matter how dark life seems, never stop looking around for that ""chink of light"" in the darkness,  that offers hope .... and then just take everything one step at a time. 
Your happiness is out there, don't ever stop looking for it!

P.S. and as to your sleazy Social Worker, I'd suggest you seriously think about reporting him, if for nothing to save some other vulnerable female from feelings you've got presently.

We stopped talking cause he became so mean but I wasn’t looking for a relationship and he was my best friend. 2 years went by and we saw each other at my senior week and started talking again. I was finally more ready for a relationship and gave him a chance. It was great at first then he slowly got bad I went to college 4hours away and he was home. The second year of us being together it started becoming on and off he would always leave me and treat me bad and every time he left it was a new reason but he would text girls 30 minutes within us fighting or breaking up. After a lot of on and off we dated throughout almost our whole 3rd year and then he broke up with me again after that. Since we broke up there’s been on and off again but he’s the only one that leaves. As far as I know he has never touched another girl but he has had tinder and I have gotten screenshots of how he texts girls and it’s really bad. But when he leaves me I feel like I can’t move on cause I don’t want it to be my fault cause I truly do love him and don’t know what to do. Now I’ll tell him flat out what hurts me and he just calls me crazy or says to stop or shut up and when I cry I don’t think he cares. I just feel like I’m going crazy cause he always finds a way to blame me and he won’t change how he acts but I also feel like I need to do everything perfect for him or he’ll leave me and go to other girls within 30 minutes so that’s also making me like hate myself in a way.

Honestly if someone is that mean and entitled even before a relationship that should be an indicator that they are way worse the closer you are and you’ve seen how he’s progressed. With him feeling entitled to you and then running off to girls 30 minutes after you have problems that should be the realization that he doesn’t like you at all he just wants entertainment. And how would it be your fault if he’s the one that can’t behave? Even if he somehow turned it around to be your fault who cares you are not his mom and you don’t have to be so responsible for someone who can’t control themselves. Take it upon yourself to be the one that leaves and if he can’t give you space then escalate from there.

1ctgutq,"Therapy is a way to get tools to work on things that are causing you problems in your life. Is your past action causing you problems? Are your current desires causing you problems? 


Do you want someone to confess to because you were never punished? Do you, despite what you say, feel at risk of repeating this and want someone to stop you from doing this sort of thing again? 


Sexuality is to a large extent programmable. We learn ""this feels good"" and on some level our brain never forgets. Our feelings have *nothing* to do with ethics or morals or what's good and kind and right in this world; feelings just *are*. Feelings are neither good nor bad. 


Actions are what matters. You were ignorant and did an ignorant thing driven by feelings. Now you're not ignorant. The feelings remain, but you have a framework which helps you keep on track. You understand more, have developed empathy. 


Kids are often selfish little shits; adults often look back on their past selves with horror. That inner horror comes from a place of growth. 


You trust your therapist, and therapy works best with honesty. Just make sure you understand your goal in therapy and are willing to do what you and your therapist agree needs to be done to achieve your goals. ",No_Savings7114,False,1715877088.0

When I’ve had to tell my therapist challenging things in the past, I have found a few different methods helpful. It can really depend on what makes you most comfortable:

 • You can send it in an email and ask her if she’d be willing to read the email in-session to help you with it.

• You can write it out in a letter and let her read it.

Those two ^ are best if you have trouble saying it out loud.

• You can turn away from your therapist or look away from your therapist so you don’t have to see her reaction to what you say, this makes it easier.

• You can turn your brain off and disassociate a little bit and just start saying the facts of the matter. For me, the first two words were challenging but once I started, it got *so much easier* and I ended up successfully saying everything in one go.

• You can tell her the story hypothetically and then admit at the end that it isn’t hypothetical and that you are struggling.

""Yes, a therapist can drop a client, but they must take steps to ensure the client has the resources and support to move forward without them.

1ctgebf,"Been there, still there. You’re not alone and thank you for sharing.

A lot of people don’t really get it, I won’t pretend I get your scenario either, but I’m always ALWAYS thinking. Anything from problems solving scenarios to conversation ands places 15 years ago. Heck, sometimes I trail off mid conversation, lost in thought. Brian fog can happen, I don’t remember a lot of finer details like people’s names surrounding times I experienced a lot of pain and trauma, just faces. It happens to the best of thinkers. 

My advice: 
Research intrusive thinking for a start. Thoughts that aren’t necessarily your own consistent thought patterns but more like your anxieties manifest as thoughts that you pass off as your own true way of thought.

Once you can learn to differentiate the types of thoughts. Look into spirituality and history behind it. Some take aways I had from that venture was understanding myself and separating me from the things happening around me that aren’t me. Spiritual practices and cultures are one of the longest prevailing traditions in humanity and there is reason for that.

Some other tips:
Give yourself a break. Too much thought can be bad. You can get lost in the expansive universe between your ears. If you’re ever “in too deep” or you can’t live a productive life because you’re compulsively thinking unchecked, do your best to fill your day with meaningful and fulfilling tasks, it helps. Form a support network outside of your biological family. Friends can help a lot and they won’t judge you as harshly or be as confused/concerned as parents, siblings, aunts/uncles etc.
Reach out if you have any questions.

She also has a split tongue and 2 tongue rings. She just looks so trashy and dirty.

ALSO!! She recently blew up on her 19 y/o for not wishing her happy Mother’s Day.

1ctf6tn,"Finding good friends is hard. What doesn't help is that ""friendship"" can mean very different things from person to person.

Some have a very lose definition and friends are just people they interact with semi-regularily or they go drinking with.

Others see it in a narrower fashion and only consider people whom they can trust and mutually share their emotions, secrets and problems with as friends.

From my subjective experience, most people match the first definition or are inbetween the first and the second one.

This means that some, and sometimes a lot of, searching is needed to find suitable friends, but they are out there.

The crux of the matter is that often, it's these moments of ""weakness"" you mentioned where it shows which type they are. So without accepting vulnerability you may never find out.

There are two paths forward: Capitulation + acceptance or trying to outgrow that traumatic experience which has understandably left a bad taste in your mouth regarding others.

Whichever you choose - commit to it. I.e. deciding that it's not worth the hassle but still dealing with all the ""what if""s and drowning yourself in sorrow over ""what will never be"", is by far the unhealthiest thing you can do.

I decided to take a gap year and have been working to pay for all the trips I wanted to take and get more experience in my field.

I’d really recommend doing this if it’s possible for you. In todays world there’s so much pressure from work and school to just grind through it all but you’re not gonna be putting your best work out if it’s making you miserable and leaving no room for personal growth.

1ctc3ft,"Hello, 

Right off the bat I would like to tell you that if you can afford it or if insurance covers it, talking out complex emotions like these with a good licensed therapist is one of the best things you can do! It has helped me come a long way in my life.

But in my unprofessional opinion, the fact that you like to take care of your appearance and make yourself look pretty is a great thing! There is nothing at all wrong with taking the time to look how you wanna look. It doesn’t have to be for any reason or for any person. Do what makes you feel good! 

Just also be sure to remember that no one can look 100% their best all time. The goal is to have empathy with yourself no matter what state you’re in. Don’t be ashamed of feeling any emotion no matter what it is, this is what it means to be human to feel! Our emotions are extremely helpful and interesting things that work best when viewed with curiosity instead of criticism.

1ctbgzo,"I think his reaction to what you have been through/are going through depends less on his current views on MH and more on your relationship with him. 

I have bipolar which was diagnosed a few years ago after I went to the hospital because I hadn't slept for days. I had moved across the country for school, so my family was not aware of what I was going through. I went to visit a few months later, at which point I was relatively stable and appeared healthy as ways. I found that it was easier to tell them when I was in a good place because I knew they would react in a better way, as they could see that it did not change who i am, and they would not have even known anything was up unless I told them. 

For background, I'm American and my parents are immigrants from South Asia and never talked about MH with me, despite there being a family history of bipolar and suicide. I had a conversation with my psychiatrist about my diagnosis and how to navigate conversation with them and came to the conclusion that it would not benefit me or them to tell them while I was still in crisis mode because chances are they would fly across the country and start helicoptering and make me feel all kinds of ways. 

So how did I tell them? I didn't necessarily even plan the conversation. I was in the car with them one day when I was back home for winter break a few months after my diagnosis, when I just felt like it was a moment I could disclose what I was going through. I said it very casually. That I had gone to the ED because I wasn't eating or sleeping and am now taking medicine for bipolar, which make me feel better and like myself again. I think talking about it so casually and being in a good place and discussing that medicine made me better normalized it more with them. They asked some questions and also asked why I didn't tell them sooner. I told them the truth that I didn't want them to worry and it's something I needed to go through myself but that I was also better now because I got help. I also countered this question with saying that I didn't have to tell them and they wouldn't know if I hadn't disclosed it at all because I am still the same person.

I was scared too. I could have never predicted their reaction. But I also had faith that they cared about me and would understand that I was in pain and getting help changed my life. It felt important to tell them in order to fight the stigma and for them to understand that MH is real and must be talked about. Despite our issues, my parents love me, try to understand me, and worry about my health. Having that relationship with them facilitated a productive conversation. I think the MH stigma is a beast that can't be tackled from one conversation, but you can start by proving to your dad that MH is real because you, as someone he loves, personally experienced hardship because of it and had to get help in order to get better. I think my parents saw that and realized that my MH was out of my control, and there was nothing wrong with me treating it just as I would treat diabetes if I had it. 

I hope this is helpful to you in some way. Good luck moving forward, and I am proud of you for getting the help you need and being able to talk about it with people even if you haven't told your dad yet.",upside_down_butt,False,1715863693.0
1ctbgzo,"Hello, 

First of all congrats to you for breaking the cycle that your father unfortunately may still be in, and taking the time and work to address your mental health! It can be a lot harder than people make it out to be.

I totally relate to what you’re saying about your father. My own parents are generally nice people, but their views on mental health are also extremely old fashioned. They are also religious so they tend to rely on that more than any actual professional help. 

I have been going to therapy for a year now and still have not told them myself. I have previously tried to bring up very generic mental health topics in terms of the world’s relationship with social media, rising depression/suicide rates etc. and received just very negative and ugly responses. Eventually between that and all of the emotional neglect I have felt from them my whole life, I realized some people just can’t change. They have developed these mechanisms in them that help them survive, help them feel tough and help them get through every day. It’s hard to get someone to crack on beliefs they hold so strongly without them being open minded to change. 

In my opinion, I wouldn’t tell your father unless you sense that he is ready to accept a concept like that. Who knows? Maybe hell watch a show read an article see something on the news that changes his mind. But from my experience getting those feelings rejected cab cause mental relapse which makes all the progress you've made seem insignificant.

In the end, mental health is a very personal thing and I think you meed to be very careful on who you select to be vulnerable with. Be proud of yourself for the progress you have made and don't let anyone's negativity stop you from growing.

I wish you all the best!",Old_Count2231,False,1715865455.0

You should speak to a doctor, there are medications that can help with this condition and some people benefit from therapy also.

Personally, I've found it helpful to try and improve on the things that bother me about my appearance. My weight typically fluctuates throughout the year and I do become very bothered by gaining a few pounds, so I simply help my mind out by shedding them. You must have realistic expectations though, I'm not going down the cosmetic surgery route as with BDD it often doesn't resolve anything, sometimes it causes even more issues with the condition so it's not a risk I'm willing to take. Same goes for weight loss, please aim to get to a healthy weight, you do **not** want to strive to be underweight. That would begin a fall into anorexia territory which is a terrifying condition.

If no then there’s no need to be worried. If yes I’d say get therapy first and focus on your anger issues because yes to either of those isn’t healthy.

Anger itself is normal and healthy. Personally I find that I internally suppress my anger. When it comes out it’s dark and quiet, but I’ve not acted on it since I was little.

My ex girlfriend broke up with me like 8 months ago. She hurt me and was very unkind to me, never apologized or felt she did anything wrong. I held back my anger for months and I went through all the phases of grieving except that one. One week I started feeling it and was so angry I couldn’t sleep for a few days.. that is, until I imagined her losing her tongue and hands (her desired career is a singer, and her creative outlets are painting, knitting, and clothing-making.

It’s the meanest and nastiest thing I’ve ever personally wanted for anyone, but I also hate her more than I’ve ever hated anyone before. 

In real like I am not unkind to her. But emotions need to be expressed and our bodies experience anger for a reason, it is not a flaw in the system. So, if imagining violence and aggression and acts of mutilation helps you process your anger, express it and feel it without physically causing harm in the real world then it’s an outlet and is fairly healthy.

I know many people box and hit heavy bags while imagining the ppl they are angry and hating. There are healthier ways to express your anger, but pretending it doesn’t exist and suppressing it for sure isn’t healthy.

Therapy can be good for everyone and it can help having a professional who can help support and guide you with practical tools and practices that show significant beneficial results. I say give therapy a go, and they can also give you an assessment to determine if you are an eligible candidate for anti-depressants or anxiety medication. That doesn’t mean you need to take them, but it helps to know if you are in a state where people are typically prescribed medication, or if you are outside or nearing the realm of medicinal support.

I‘m not sure how I should call it, but I often times had compulsive dreams (don‘t know if you actually call them like this but nevermind) where I slit my throat with a kitchen knife over and over like a gif in front of my mental eye until I woke up in panic. Also I had the feeling like a dark figure in the corner of my vision or in the back of my mind wanted to occupy my body to commit homicide, felt genuinely concerning.
That are like things that I experience, but they eventually go away when you feel less stressed. It helped me to really cope with things that trigger me in a bad way like trauma or anxiety by pursuing hobbies that genuinely relax me like drawing and at the same time also facing the things that I fear to process them.

So instead switch your thinking. The way we do this is to marvel instead of fear, accept instead of quantify. The gasp can terrify or the gasp can emancipate. Don’t try to figure it out, you can’t!

1ct6mno,"As men stereotypically prefer solutions to emotional validation, I'm going to talk through the fixes for problems men face. I am a man, I am at different levels of progress with these things myself but things are going great.


One of the problems men face is that they hide their humanity, and then unveil it to those who have accepted them as a robot. I have a great difficulty getting other men to listen to me when I say this.


There is something quite unintuitive in the fix. We need to wear our humanity on our sleeves, and tank the face rejection from people who don't like men being human beings instead of a Man Archetype. We will repel these people, and it will hurt. What you don't see when this happenes, is that if you hid your humanity for years then unveiled it, they'd reject you then anyway.


The love, respect, adoration, and so on we may receive for wearing the mask of A Man is fake. It's not for us, it's for our character. A character we can't even take pride in having created, for we plagiarised it from their expectations of us. The only way to be loved for who we really are, is to be who we really are. This is what ""be yourself"" means. It doesn't mean ""if you be yourself, you will get everything you want"" it means if you lie and manipulate and falsify to get things those things are not for you, but if you are yourself only the things that are for you will stay.



Now, as for the ways men are valued for their performance, understand evaluating our worth from others is fickle and detrimental to our wellbeing. Of course, it can be deeply internalised. It's pretty ingrained in western culture that men are providers. Men are attractive when they are successful - as a contrast to women being attractive when they are youthful, for example. 

The answer is to become self validating. To build trust in yourself, to develop your own values. To detach yourself from our cultural influences to decide who we are. This is actually one of the advantages of being autistic I believe - personally I spent a lot of energy trying to fit in and be normal, but the second I let myself just be me I saw how lightly social pressures really affect me. One path towards understanding yourself in this area is to figure out what you want. Write it all down. Then determine which of these things are expectations set by society (e.g. wife and kids), which are set by a culture (e.g. be like X to attract a partner, have X job by Y age), which are set by parents, and which are set by you.",videogamesarewack,False,1715862446.0

1ct0gzw,I saw your other posts and I get where you’re coming from… you look absolutely fantastic but it’s body dysmorphia. I have the same issue as a frequent gym goer and it sucks!,unlikelyduck116,False,1716231096.0
1ct0gzw,"I’m not sure, I struggle myself in this area, but as a man, and an individual, my preference and enjoyment in a woman’s beauty is not “thin”. I try to avoid women who are-so because it is as unattractive to me as is being obese. 

I feel like there is a sweet spot where women look incredibly beautiful somewhat outside of the term ‘thin’ and closer to the word ‘curvy’ and the guys I tend to chat with agree with that to at least a 95% rate.

But, that is the current beauty standard of most men in society right now. And your question is how do I change my own beauty standards and feel like I am enough, beautiful, and pretty.

For this, it’s much more complicated. I suppose in little tiny ways you should look to try improving your self esteem. Instead of focusing on areas you have a lot of shame about, try finding at least one asset that you believe holds beauty. And every day spend time admiring it and enjoying it. If you can, try seeing if you can add another. Write poems and love notes to these areas of your physical beauty.

After you feel pretty good about that, and once you find yourself thinking and enjoying these areas daily, (and after feeling you exhausted all the areas of beauty) start trying to find neutral areas and repeat the process. Think about how they help support the things you find beautiful about yourself and how they themselves may be beautiful in ways you hadn’t thought of before. 

Try occasionally  Asking people you trust what physical feature or asset they find to be your most beautiful and enjoyable asset to look at, ask them why, and see if you’re ever surprised by their answers. Then write love notes about it regardless of if they told you something new, or not. See if you can include the ways they viewed this feature in the love notes.

Self love isn’t something you can just fall into tomorrow, but it’s something you’ll be not so good at some days, and better on others. It’s something that takes a whoooole lot of time too, so don’t feel you need to rush it or push yourself on days that self love feels really hard, instead on those days try doing stuff for you that is kind but doesn’t contribute to thoughts or feelings of beauty or lack of it and just try enjoying yourself. Some days we end up being meaner to ourselves and getting frustrated so try being self-aware so you can avoid those pitfalls on worse days.

Look up other ways too for increasing self-love and finding new ways to appreciate or build a sense of worth within yourself. You are much more than your beauty, so enjoy what and who you are. ❤️‍🩹",Bassdiagram,False,1715823010.0

1ct0gzw,Stretch marks dont destroy your body in any way. They are just marks. No person will think they take away from your looks. However I can't seem to really understand the insecurity itself. I have self harm scars from top to bottom alongside stretch marks from bodybuilding. The self harm scars are just signs of the struggle I've overcome and the stretch marks show the progress I've made doing bodybuilding the same way your scars represent progress from an unhealthy weight to a healthy one. Not to say be proud of them but accept them for what they really are.,Bad_Chapter,False,1715851966.0
1ct0gzw,"Both anorexia and your current situation are rooted in self hatred /not being good enough. The root cause is oftentimes children being scolded for things they don't understand. If they're left to ""figure out what they did wrong"", theyre go-to solution is ""something about *me* is bad"", which then results in a decreased self-value. The severity and coping mechanism depends on your environment and character. 

In order to heal from that therapy is necessary (either alone or with a professional). If you want to look into it on your own, here are some youtube videos I found helpful:

1ct0gzw,"Thank you so much. I know I’m technically in that sweet spot, men approach me and everything, but I just still have the anorexia nervosa thoughts, where I need to be as thin as possible. I find myself consuming a lot of media of models and such where they are all like bmi 16, and it’s so hard not to compare myself to them. I know I shouldn’t care how they look but the disorder gets in the way of rationality sometimes.

A big problem I deal with is people assuming I never struggled with eating because I’m healthy now. They just have no clue the thoughts that go through my head on a daily basis, and the hours spent body checking. Weight gain doesn’t make the mental illness go away, it just heals the physical body. And I wish people stopped saying otherwise, because it perpetuates this idea that people who are under bmi 16 are the only ones who have anorexia. Which just isn’t true. I just manage mine because I value a fuller life than one taken over by malnourishment.",Working_Trip4696,True,1715873359.0

1ct0gzw,"I’m sorry to hear this dear. When you put things this way, I can understand how frustrating and painful it all can feel, and I’m sorry that you’re not only dealing with your own internal struggles, but social ones too.. I think you should try communicating your others that you still have the anorexia mindset even though you chose to prioritize the health and wellness of your body over the impulses and desires that the thoughts and feelings wish for you. 

I didn’t really talk about my severe depression ever, but when I started talking with my mom occasionally, she started treating me more kindly and gentler now that she understands better, my dad as well but I never spoke to him directly. I can’t promise everyone will be understanding and accepting, but the ones who love you and trust you the most likely will, and for me it brought a lot of relief and a sense of support. 

I’m sure you also know, but if you can you should avoid that kind of media (models and BMI stuff). I had a similar thing, it was something that I went and pursued nearly daily and every time I would, it would end up hurting me more and wildling me down and causing more anxiety and emotional issues in my life than the boon and temporary enjoyment of consuming the media. Although, I can imagine looking at that kind of media likely no longer brings you any joy. 

Anyway stay strong!! I’m super proud of you for the choices you’ve dedicated yourself to so far!!! It’s super super difficult and I think you are very brave and strong to prioritize the difficult option. I hope you find lots of ppl who support, love, and accept you as you keep working towards self love and away from self hate. 🧡",Bassdiagram,False,1715890793.0

1cszrcf,"Imo, Empathy happens when you're invested in someone. If you were to kill off a bunch of characters in a story and you never introduced these characters, then the audience wouldn't care. You've likely watched action movies where characters died and you felt no empathy. Maybe it was a common grunt or bad guy, or maybe it was just a character you deeply hated. The audience doesn't have a reason to care for them because those characters are just seen as obstacles to the protagonist. A writer has to ""develop"" the character for the character to be related to. Give them a backstory and a conflict, social dynamics maybe... Etc..

1cszrcf,"ASPD does have a criterion of lack of empathy (although nearly always present), NPD does. That said I have NPD and I do have a lack of empathy.

Specifically I lack affective (emotional) empathy, I rarely feel what other people feel. for ages I thought I did, because when someone else got upset, I got upset. partially this *was* real empathy (I would always cry when others did) but a lot of it was just someone else's emotions affecting me (e.g. someone talks about SI which is a trigger for me and too much to bear).

My cognitive empathy could use some work sometimes. generally I'm okay at reading people but I find it hard to deal with sarcasm and ""reading between the lines"". I am also not very familiar with societal rules as a lot of them don't make sense to me, which makes it harder to find out whether I've (accidentally) upset someone.

I do usually have an overflow of compassionate empathy. I love helping other people with their issues or with finding their own solutions. Sometimes it is hard for me to want to help though. That's mostly in situations with toxic venting (consistently venting about a problem someone has the ability but not the willingness to change) and when I am upset with the person that needs help.

1cszrcf,"I think there are three types of empathy. 

Cognitive - where you can intellectualize the feelings. Like reading it from wikipedia.

Affective - I FEEL what you feel, maybe this is long talks in the car and story swapping, maybe even trauma bonding. 

Compassionate - probably focuses on actionable empathy. This is the one that kinda requires that 3rd party between yourself and your future. ""Not that you believe in yourself but you believe in someone else that believes in you."" Healthy social validation that can transform feelings into the future. 

  
From my experience those with mental health conditions but are still functional have high cognitive empathy. But struggle with affective empathy. They are somehow emotionally blocked from experiences beyond the basics of common social graces. Or when things get emotionally deep there is a defense mechanism or fear that is unhealthy that presents itself. 

Also more emotions just manifest and become more complex as we age and as we experience life too. When you are stuck in a PTSD phase or afflicted with a condition that keeps you emotionally stunted or arrested in development you can have gaps in many feelings. 

Again much of this goes back and forth of what is functional and what isn't functional in society.   
I could say that narcissistic attitudes are the majority of first world emotions in ""functioning adults"" till like 30-35 and after they struggle with developing and filling out their emotional spectrum.

1cy42ph,"This year I changed schools and there was a group of girls (4). One wasn’t going to school for few first weeks because she was on vacation, and I got in the friend group, until that girl came to school. She hated me for no reason, constantly talked about hanging out (with the rest of the friend group) without me on purpose and if we interacted in any way, she’d always snap on me, or yell. At first I felt so bad, I even asked mom to move schools but it was the middle of the year so she couldn’t. I guess I picked one way: I stopped showing her that I’m offended by that and started to talk about something she’s not included in with other girls in her presence, BUT without being really obvious about it. I never did something straight bad so that she couldn’t complain about it, I just did slight moves. So slowly, I got on one lever with her (I feel like she was thinking that she was better than me, cuz she’s “rich” or smarter etc), I showed her she’s not better than me by not being jealous or impressed every time she was bragging about anything (trips, or her rich parents, A+’s). I mean, maybe it’s not the best piece of advice, but if you feel less because anyone doesn’t include you anywhere, realise that they’re not better or cooler than you just because that.

You could try a psychiatrist if you want, I mean, it's not really a contract you can't back out of, so you could just not go back if you didn't want to. Idk if it would do much, though... unless you'd want a diagnosis.

I relate to what you said about the studies... I had no problems in elementary but sometime around middle and high school I just... stopped being able to achieve anything... whether I tried or not. And with the being slow and doing things only your way, that sounds a lot like my bf who has diagnosed ASD. If that would be your case too, then there really isn't much you can do expect trying to force yourself to adapt, but I don't recommend that.

1cy2uvz,"Think about it like this:

You’re the boss. The foreman. Your job is to try making sure everything flows smoothly and you aspire to have employees you can trust to take care of their tasks without issue, because the last thing you want is extra work for yourself, or other employees. 

You have two employees.

One is ready, willing, and happy to come up to you ready for the next task, or willing to (comfortably and happily) chat and discuss in detail the intricacies of the job, personal life, aspirations for the future, funny things they saw or did, etc.

The other doesn’t want to talk and always seems visibly uncomfortable or awkward when discussing work or personal life stuff, they seem to prefer not to be around you or anyone else, and they don’t really give too much feedback when communicating.

The first employee seems like work has been a breeze, like anything can be handled regardless of the task. The second employee feels hard to trust, possibly coming off as guilty-seeming but for what, who can say?

People are often cited as “social creatures” and small chitchat and chatter is important for building rapport with people and helping people feel comfortable around you, and confident that you’re reliable.

You should try learning graceful ways to exit conversations so you can do the whole big chitchat thing, but not over-strain your social battery because you aren’t sure how to stop a conversation.",Bassdiagram,False,1716395675.0

I feel like the only times I've made any improvements were when I was rambling about something and since I was saying it outloud if clicked in my brain for some reason.

If I can suggest, try changing something small first. Becoming confident is a big thing to tackle. Pick out the smallest thing you feel like you're doing for others and try to change that first.

Like eyes but things you are disgusted by, like chin ( you might be disgusted by double chin/moles in the chin or facial hair like beard)

So these were just questions, but I cannot just land you suggestions.. I need to talk to you personally or somthin.. these are just starting questions, if I can get more of your review, it'll be great if you chat me personally..

1cxyest,"i mean it doesn't really hurt per se. it's just that humans in general look gross and or plain annoying. sure, it sucks to feel that about yourself, especially on top of all the other things one feels about their own body, but it's not emotionally painful or anything. probably. i just look at people differently than how i assume other people do, and my way of seeing things is just objectively worse than the default.",No_Cantaloupe5820,True,1716401999.0
1cxyest,"it varies by the day, but there's typically no difference in my opinion for most of what you list. if anything, fat makes most people look a little better imo just as a preference thing. the thing is, especially when it comes to sex stuff, people are just sacks of flesh. like? i just look at people and instead of seeing something cohesive i just see a bunch of fat and muscle and bones and skin. i guess that happens to other people but they don't mind???? i just really don't like human flesh, esp all the fluids and shit that comes off of it. just disgusting",No_Cantaloupe5820,True,1716404656.0

1cxyest,"i mean i think most people find vomit gross. it's not specific to any one look, literally every human inspires some kind of disgust. it's more that the concept is disgusting. like hotdogs. it's like if you had to think about how a hotdog was made every time you saw one. hotdogs aren't gross usually, but thinking about the dog sludge while you eat them makes it worse. it's like that",No_Cantaloupe5820,True,1716408756.0

1cxwrvn,"There were a few things that resonated with me in you post. And I wanted to share some thoughts.


It will get easier with time. Time in mental health feels endless. You have done so much work, that the good things will come, it will change as you do. Bit by bit.


You may need to redefine what ""better"" means. After all  Life  Changing  Events, do just that, they change you.  


Your body, your mind, your being has been shaken to its foundations. This is true for other survivors too, say someone who survives a heart attack, cancer, diabetes.


You may return to your life at full swing or you may need more time and support to recoup. You will be different now, so honor that. Let it be growth not dispair for what was.


Finally in your statement below. 


""I feel no different. I am constantly physically reacting to thoughts so painful and sharp that it feels like I am back in the moment. I feel ashamed of past events, I feel ashamed of the person I was, I feel ashamed and embarrassed and bad and helpless. No matter what I do, I can't get through more than half an hour with myself alone without remembering something which makes me recoil from myself. I avoid things which trigger these thoughts but it seems like the more I avoid, the more new things there are to recall.""


This may be some feelings that may actually  represent a trauma. Pehaps of what happened to you, perhaps of what you did. Or some other way that has left a scar. Be compassionate with yourself in this space. And self-compassion is the antidote to shame.


I hope you can someone to help you through this. Maybe consider a peer worker or someone who really get you. Thats what helps me

Let that shame go.  You are no longer that person you was previously.  Whatever happened in the past you cannot change.  You have nothing to feel ashamed, embarrassed, bad or helpless about.  Concentrate on the positive things you're doing with your life and family.

Of course it sounds easy and it only took me 6 years to process my grief with the help of a therapist/counselor.  Now when I think of my father, I think of the happier moments with him and less about the fact he's no longer with us.

I tried playing video games that involves timing your dodges and attacks very precisely, and did terrible. Ended up trying games with a little more flexibility in play style and now I'm extremely good at these types of games.

Sometimes it's really really hard, but it has helped me even a little before and that little bit, was a lot when I have a lot of anxiety.",Vikoyuni,False,1716371969.0
1cxvetx,"I personally have something extremely similar. I tend to get this doom feelings, a sense of fear, or as if something is about to happen. I tend to get this a lot on making phone calls or making calls, mainly as if what I'm doing brings me terrible anxiety and for no reason at all. I go through it but the feeling is as if The world was stopping me the fear and the tension is so great including a knot on your stomach feeling of tension so great you could start running and never stop or breaking things or screaming or crying, but is such an intense feeling. 

In my personal experience it may mean you've had past issues before that were relatable that affect you emotionally and you simply have trauma from it. An example from my personal experience is my childhood really. I still remember the feeling I would get when my mother would call me, is the exact same feeling I feel right now and the exact same feeling I get on this moments as if my mother and step-father were calling me to speak to me. Or the feeling I would get in a suspense moment in a Horror movie when something is about to happen. So great as if something is always so wrong and as how it would feel when they would hurt me emotionally again and again and again and again and again and again and again. Because all I can really say is that until this day I still do not know who I am. I cry about everyday out of confusion and pain, pain is something that seems to have taken over me, it's so intensislfying I could die now, I can say I am not afraid of death, but I hope to find myself, to be someone who can say I am me and feel whole, because I feel broken, as if there's no reason for existance and I truly seek more meaning in it, and I still look forward for a new way of justifying evil such as sexual assult, I seek for a justification for the allowance of evil as such by GOD.

 Why am I so me, I feel lots of shame for things that maybe I shouldn't as I was just a child, even though I understand more in a sense of what I consider right and know how I would make my choices and actions would be as a person with values and morals, I still feel it's not enough, I don't feel whole, the idea of everything weights on me. I am so intelligent I wish I wasn't but then I don't wish it I simply find it overwhelming as well as helpful. Main point is that no matter how much information you can break down and how much you get, I may never feel whole or peace, or that feeling of nothing is wrong. My mind is like broken glass in a white and black room, my mind is also me laughing and crying simultaneously as I destroy every inch of my body from the inside out with my nails or with a charp knife or gillet, my mind is me singing alone broken in fear again and again and again and again. I control so much inside of me I may break any second. It's as if I'm nothing but also everything as once. It doesn't matter how much I tell myself this is not a worrisome or anxious situation that shouldn't bring me this horrible feeling, it will still happen and it would feel dreading because you realize how much it can control over personal rational and or logical perspective as well as your body causing such as body trauma. 

The feeling I remember started when I was probably 5 or 6 maybe 7 I truly don't remember exactly the age. But I had a horrible feeling of dead, as if one day I will die and have no chance to ever be saved, I felt as If everything was over as if what's the point of living life if I'm going to die and it'll feel as if it flew by. 

At that age in that moment I could see myself older about to die and seeing life as if it was just that fast and that easy to die to be damned or saved and for some reason I felt it was scary as if I couldn't let go of the idea that what's the point. This feeling when on for a long time. I kept saying but I'm going to die, over and over the day will come and my grandmother would tell me that is okay that it doesn't feel that way that I will forget feeling this way and one day It'll change the mentality and feeling that death was imminent and after it I didn't know what was after and or how scary it  may be.
She had to ask someone to bring an specific type of holy blessed water from a far and after I had some on my head and all the cross signs etc on me. I got better but I changed, I became more aware and fearful of everything and had more control over it. But felt like it was never over. And until this day I am someone but also no one. 

But in regards your personal issue, I suggest bringing it up to a psychiatrists as it's more of a trauma based situation unless you believe it may have nothing to do with something that has impacted you in your life, it's still an issue you'll most likely need therapy for. Everyone needs help differently and you seem to need healing, recuperating, it'll take time but it will be over I am sure... yes, I do tell myself this.",DominikAxel30,False,1716373957.0
1cxvcxu,"- The Weekend -

I’d say that it’s just one of those things. They may be cruel people, they may be two people having a bad day. It’s understandable that unsolicited confrontation would provoke a reaction. 

It’s good to reflect on your behaviour and question whether you could have handled things better. That implies your intentions are to grow as a person, which is great. We’re only human, at the end of the day.

- The Past - 

If your goal is to “forget” about the past, you’re already at a disadvantage because the reason you remember these memories / emotions so vividly is because of Neuroplasticity. It’s literally wired in your brain and the more you actively recall it the more neurological connections you form.

So, if you can’t beat them, join them.

If you can’t erase the memory, you could reframe it and control the narrative.

You can reflect on the past and leverage its lessons to help you navigate the present. Try to shift how you feel about a person/ experience.

How?

By changing what you think, or rather how you reflect on it. The power is in your head, you have to train your brain like you would a muscle. This is no joke, mental health and emotional intelligence is crushing men because they deny its legitimacy.

Train your brain, change how you think and subsequently change how you feel. 

Example:

Say you argued with an ex a lot and you feel bad about how you treated them. There’s no point dwelling on it, ask yourself why you acted in the ways you didn’t agree with. Investigate the underlying issues or blocks that prevented you responding in a way that represents the real you.

If you dot this, next time a similar situation comes up you’re equipped with the Awareness. If you’re aware, you have the Power to change your response and yield a different result.

Though if you don’t learn from the past, you by default will repeat your mistakes.

Hope this helps.

Remember, perspective is your choice.",Empathetic-Listener,False,1716370933.0

The proper mindset is so important, and even small things like ""I have an addiction to alcohol"" vs ""I'm alcoholic"" are can be so helpful in recovery. A lot of people who struggle with addiction are too ashamed to seek help. Addiction is a maladaptive coping mechanism- one that people are socially and genetically predisposed to engage in. 

But like... I have ADHD. I'm neurodivergent. This is incurable, even with treatment (which has dramatically improved my life) I will never *not* be neurodivergent.

as for who gets to determine what language you use? always people in that community. if you are part of the demographic you’re speaking about, you get to decide how you want to refer to yourself. for other groups, if you’re not sure, use the term that feels most respectful, look it up if you can, and if someone part of the demographic is present you can ask them what’s more appropriate. however, different people in the same group might have different opinions on that.",TheWhaleDreamer,False,1716407846.0

Yr 11 is supposed to be the last year that u cherish and the most remeberable. But everything from Yr 10 -11 is a fog.  

11 yrs, from primary yr1 all the way to Yr 11 wasted and gone just for all the preparation, studying and going to a school that I hated, to get a fair score, just for my final gcse be a predicted grade.

1cxtdin,"I used to feel disgusted and baffled at these things being presented as a universal agent for better mental health. Like going to the gym. But then again, at that time, I would refuse to leave my “comfort zone”. 

It was when I finally gave it a shot, as well as implementing other gradual changes that are often suggested (like eating healthy, get outside), I started to feel a whole lot better and gained much more confidence and social skills (even if the first few days felt like hell when I would almost vomit all over the place, and feel as if my memory is getting worse.)

But honestly, thing is, the way these things are presented in a simple way, without letting know of stuff like the actual chemical effects on the mind etc. like “go do this, be happy 100% :D “, that’s when it feels like it won’t work. Or even if the positive effects of the activity start to wear off a little over time, it can feel like it never helped in the first place. 

Thing is, these activities do help uplift you enough so that you can actually do something about your problem/s, and can actually implement the positive benefits into your life for better mental health. But some aren’t able to reach through that point. And when people tell you to “do something about it”, it can come across as unsympathetic and confrontational, like the other person doesn’t exactly know or understand properly what you’re going through.

If you were doing this with say video games or a pet it would be still be concerning but not nearly. It seems they are afraid of you developing a codependency with her and it was be so so so devasting to you if she broke up with you (not that she would I don't know her but that's how parents think). Is there an alternative you could either do on your own or speak with your parents about that could, say, Supplement an hour from talking with (say, if you had a dog you loved going and talking he/she for a walk, playing, etc) or a hobby you could pick up? It would be easier on you if you became more dependent on something that's not a person in their eyes.

In turn, I haven't smothered my husband.  I'm not saying your smothering her, but your parents may seem afraid you will.

Hell, you don't have to do something extravagant like college or military. As long as you're able to survive, that's all that matters. 

Maybe focus on your hobbies, things you like doing. Stuff that interests you. 


And unless porn/masturbating is interfering with your life or you simply just can't take your mind off of it, then it likely isn't an addiction. I know talking about that is absolutely difficult and embarrassing. But if you feel it is an addiction, then definitely obtain help and information to help combat it. It's normal to masterbate every day. It's natural and human to do so. 

Try to replace alcohol with some other type of drink. You could try Bobas, they are really good. Or drink non alcoholic beer, it'll replicate the taste, but you won't get drunk.

1cxpe43,"even if you don't have mental illnesses, therapy benefits you anyway! you don't need to 'have it bad' or have a shitty life to go to therapy, there's no invisible qualification you need to meet to go, lol. while some people may have drastically different issues than you, it doesn't mean you can't learn and grow and change with a therapist to help you. 


therapy is meant to be a place where you can discuss what you're feeling and get an unbiased perspective or skills to help solve any problem. if you're stressed about school, that's a reason to go! and on the plus side, you can talk about whatever the hell you want, and that's the beauty of therapy. someone is there to listen to you, and they legally can't tell anyone else. that's pretty awesome. once i talked to my therapist about our favourite horror movies for 30 minutes, it was pretty great. 


i'm a psych student so i am biased, but there have been countless studies that show that cognitive behavioural therapy is beneficial to anyone who will go in with an open mind. give it a shot, i promise you'll learn so much about yourself.

EDIT: and plus- therapy is not a finite resource, you aren't stealing it from others to take it for yourself. if your therapist has open spots for new clients, it means that you aren't taking it from anyone. and plus- the people who desperately need therapy will most likely have gotten it already. hell, even what you wrote here could be good to address with a therapist!",SunReyys,False,1716355017.0

I try to create (still do) a ""sanctity of mind"" I guess you can call it. Its where I hold things dear to my life and health in certain places, probably why I'm always re-organising and shifting/sorting things, I'm still trying to do it for myself.

But the ""sanctity of my mind"" thing is like you keep a a harmony of a location or place, where you feel safe. Mine was usually a lounge room or bedroom playing video games, although, I'd hope to rid myself of too overtly violent games if possible. Or at least ""fast"" them and only play them in the right circumstances.

over the years music was definately a big escape for me from seeing things myself, I willingly submitted myself to toxic music all trying to be tough and whatnot and looking back I abhorr it.

Its difficult to say what kind of thing you would enjoy doing to help this thing as it comes down to personality on what would actually work for you.

for me, exercise (walking) and making MY thoughts more pronounced rather than anything you'd hear of would possibly be writing, I have done some short stories and songwriting and I've been told that my writing can be good.

I often forget how I was pre depression, and then I realized that pre depression I had that childlike wonder. I found happiness in the small things. Someone's smile, the way my grandpa would mess with my grandma just to give himself a laugh, the cute lil squirrels climbing up trees. Train your mind to appreciate the tiniest things, eventually your thoughts will shift into looking for little things to appreciate throughout the day and it'll take the edge off. Even if it's watching funny pet videos for hours on TikTok. 

Your mind is bombarded with negativity rn and that's all it can focus on.. so it seems impossible to focus on positive things. So find little happy moments to appreciate throughout the day. Ground yourself, go step outside in your bare feet. Focus on breathing in the wind, how the wind feels touching your skin, how the ground feels beneath your feet. Focus on releasing all of that built up negativity into the ground.

1cxjtai,"Routine, routine, routine. Some of the things that make your quality of life better, are things you can do for yourself.
Take time outside; grounding, short walks. These are good to do alone.
Learn to be alone and feel good with it. Feel comfortable with it. If you aren't now, start with short walks alone. Learn to exist with your thoughts. Learn to love with your 'self'. Once you do that, it's easier for others to love you. It makes it easier to accept love.
Cleanliness. Keep up with all those menial things in life; laundry, dishes, dusting, vacuuming. When your surroundings are tidy and clean, it's makes it easier to keep your thoughts the same way. The practice of picking up, helps you 'pick up' all those pieces we forget about in our heads. 
Never seek major victories; pick battles that are difficult, but achievable. Then, over time, those unthinkably difficult tasks suddenly seem possible. But more importantly, you see and learn the value of hard work and the feeling of reward when you do achieve things.
It's nice to have a clean kitchen. It feels good to walk into a bathroom that isn't disgusting. It feels even better when it's yours.

Life is hard enough without our [black dogs](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0141076818808428) following us around. When you work on those little things; routine, nature, cleanliness and emotional health, the black dog starts to lag further behind.

1cxhupa,"I'm 27 and I dealt with the same issues with violence and anger at your age. I dealt with racism issues at my school and I had horrible thoughts about the people that would say things. Life is tough, you shouldn't have it so tough at your age. But you need to consider one factor. One being that at your age your hormones are changing and through the roof, this causes emotional disturbances and you find yourself solely focusing on how awful everything is in life because it's so overwhelming. This will pass as you get older.

I come from a broken home, (single mom), with a supportive family, but I still had issues with my family not accepting me for being biracial. I tried so hard at your age to fit in and be normal like the rest of the kids in my class but it seemed impossible bc their lives were SO much easier and happier than mine. You have to learn to accept that you're not like everyone else and that's not a bad thing whatsoever. Forcing yourself to become like the others just makes you become even more insecure and wondering why God would do this to you. 

Unfortunately, from my perspective, it's not God hating you... it's life being life. You weren't handed a good deal of cards, and now you're left trying to hold things together. The negative things always hit harder than the good. But never forget to bring yourself something happy to your life. Who cares that you lose at sports, video games. Do them because you enjoy playing. Don't play sports you might not enjoy or judge yourself on just because it might make you fit in and feel normal. Play video games because you enjoy them, everyone dies on there, practice makes perfect. Find a friend group that understands what you're going through, that also wasn't dealt an easy life. That was detrimental to my healing, knowing that there were others who understood what I was going through. 

Find another outlet for your anger, don't let it build up. Go out in the woods and break stuff. Go for walks and listen to music or a podcast. All of this bs that you're going through, after high school it will get so much easier I promise. Try therapy, talking with other people who struggle online like this. Find outlets to let that anger out and vent. 

You'll find when you get older that when things are really good, something bad is going to happen.. but as you learn to move through it those negative situations won't hit you so hard and you'll be able to move past them. Keep your head up, the negativity is only temporary. Don't give up, keep fighting for a better life.. let that anger drive you to become the person you want to be. And screw anyone who judges you, they're tiny blips that are only going to be in your life for a fraction of the time. 

Don't give up! You have so many great things coming in your future, life is just preparing you for the bumps in the road that eventually won't phase you.

1cxhupa,"I have OCD and this sounds like OCD. The obsession is fixating on bad things happening. And the compulsion is reassuring yourself every time something bad happens that it's true.

Here's a [good reddit post explaining it.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210914135605/https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/po3935/so_you_might_have_ocd) See if you can relate with anything on it. 

Also there's many 'subtypes' or themes to OCD and that can include [existential ocd](https://iocdf.org/expert-opinions/to-be-or-not-to-be-that-is-the-obsession-existential-and-philosophical-ocd) and [harm ocd](https://www.treatmyocd.com/blog/what-is-harm-ocd-guide-to-ocd-subtype). But the underlying principle is the same across all the themes, which is doubt or fear that you will lose control and do something you don't want to do or that you repeatedly doubt you have a problem because you can so easily rationalize and logically explain what you think is wrong with you, but that you can't let go of those thoughts. A lot of OCD is engaging with these intrusive thoughts so much that they become obsessions that you compulsively try to make sense of what it all could mean.

Definitely follow up with your healthcare provider until you can find out exactly what is going on because it is distressing you so much and disrupting/interfering with your day-to-day life. What you don't want to do is to let it go untreated because year after year the symptoms will become more severe and it really takes a mental toll and creates trauma just having to deal with it constantly and not knowing what to do about it. 

And I write all this on the small chance that it may apply just because even though it is treatable, it is [often under and misdiagnosed as something else](https://psychiatry.ufl.edu/patient-care-services/ocd-program/ocd-a-fact-sheet). So if you can relate with any of the info here, then you will be better equipped for getting the help you may possibly need.

>On average, people with OCD see 3 to 4 doctors and spend over 9 years seeking treatment before they receive a correct diagnosis. Studies have also found that **it takes an average of 17 years from the time OCD begins for people to obtain appropriate treatment.**

>**OCD is under-diagnosed and under-treated for many reasons. Some people may not have access to treatment resources. People with OCD may be secretive about their symptoms or they may lack insight about their illness. Many healthcare providers are not familiar with the symptoms or are not trained in providing the appropriate treatments.** Also, people with OCD may come to a healthcare provider complaining about symptoms of depression or another anxiety disorder, which frequently co-occur with OCD. They may not tell their doctor about their OCD symptoms and their doctor may not ask, and the diagnosis of OCD therefore gets missed. This is unfortunate, as early diagnosis and proper treatment can help people avoid the suffering associated with OCD, and lessen the risk of developing other problems, such as depression or marital and work problems.",impactedturd,False,1716358992.0

The Laws of Human Nature is a great book. It will help you orient yourself around negative people, you'll see them for what they are. You'll be able to see through the mask they project and into their soul.

I'd also get to mastering your pain and past. Understand it. All your mistakes, who did what, what you could of done to prevent it etc. It will give you valuable insight.

1cxhupa,"I feel that way sometimes, and my TBI on my sixteenth birthday didn't make it any better. In my viewpoint, everything happens for a reason, by internal or external forces, or both. 
From my experiences, especially after some heavy reading and observations of my Thinking, I am able to balance out this good-bad in my world by a few different methods. 

Breathwork- deep, slow nasal breathing during the stress.  Longer exhales than your inhales, through the nose. 🙏❤️ Don't forget the squeeze that jaw muscle 😉

Water/food- yup I'm taking the time to explain 1 piece here. Headaches are the first sign or dehydration, and negative thoughts are the first sign of hunger. Food is energy, so use it. Don't just store it. 

Nutrition- the gut and brain are inextricably connected via the vague nerve. Poor diet with resume in poor cognition. Check out ThermoDiet charts, and avoid the blockers of health(PUFAs, artificial sweeteners, canola/vegetable oils, high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, etc..) 

Meditate- no need for the cross-legged 'aom' chants, but be more mindful of what you're grateful for. You have the friends and family support, a great start.  Better yet, if/when you find yourself in a flow state of mind, Think on your gratitude there. Maybe its running, gaming, mowing the lawn, pretty much anything your mind can wander but your body is still on task.  Try to tune Thinking into an ""I get to"" mentality instead of ""I have to"".  There are other aids for the angst like 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, or perhaps your state's mental health phone line(MN).

Gym- weight lifting is a great anger release for those who hate being called skinny, because it only takes a few months of releasing anger here before we all start to see your progress. Not the mention dopamine and other bodily chemicals and balances, blah, blah, blah.

Knowledge- knowing is half the battle.  It doesn't matter how religious you are, or how/if you read.  Expand your mind toward any of the near infinite amounts of Literature for either distraction, education, purpose, or whatever.

1cxhupa,"i was once in a similar place. i started having suicidal ideations in 6th grade, and i swear it got worse as each year past. i felt insane and eventually brought it to my parents attention but it was in a screaming and frantic fit of emotion. my parents laughed at me and called me pathetic.

i also had similar violent ideations towards myself and others. they made me feel horrible in return and i would never want to act on them they would haunt me. 

i am in my 20s now and graduated from both high school and college. i am feeling so much better. life isn’t perfect and i still feel bad sometimes but man it’s like a breath of fresh air. this will sound stupid but it’s honestly what made me get through. i survived on the pure spite that i deserve happiness and success. when all else felt like it was against me i used my anger and sadness and redirected it in a way to support myself. 

it’s easier said than done, at least in my case. i often felt like my brain was forcing me to be miserable and to endure bad things. i made a small mistake? my brain was telling me i deserved a consequence that was later self inflicted. but you’ve got to try and fight it. find hobbies. take time outside. meditate. things like that worked a lot for me",SubstantialSatan,False,1716396426.0

Despite my older brother passing 8 yrs ago and my younger brother going down an eerily similar path complete with 4 suicide threats, nothing has changed. For years, I was putting 99% in while they put 1% in. I have set boundaries where I told family that I could no longer support them financially in any way because it was enabling them ($17k over 6 years enabled them to keep making bad decisions). I have also stopped putting effort into one-way relationships and instead put that extra energy into myself, and I feel like a totally different person. I'm 37 now and wish I had started therapy a long time ago. I don't dwell on the past because there is nothing that anyone can say that will change it, I can only protect myself from being in the same situation in the future.

If you cannot get past this step, then you’ll never truly heal, we are our own biggest enemy in this regard. Secondly, mistakes are the building blocks of life, they are key experiences that will help you later on down the line, so take these mistakes that you’ve made and use them to learn from and better yourself. Thirdly, realize that you’ll never be perfect and you’ll still make mistakes, just make sure that you don’t make the same ones. Fourthly, find something that you are passionate about and use it as your motivation to work towards a goal. Even if your passion happened to deal with your past mistakes, you’re never truly too far gone, it’s up to you to accept you had errors but you’re not going to let them stop you from achieving your goal. And the final MOST important step; stop turning to people, or turning to yourself, and instead turn to God. God has all the answers you’d ever need, and he as a path tailored exactly for you, talk to him, cry to him, and be real with him and you’ll get the guidance that you desire. The day I stopped turning to man, was the day I truly started healing. What do you have to lose from giving God a chance? Nothing. It’s free, all you have to do is call out to him, and he always listens, even when you feel like no one else will. This truly is the best piece of advice I can give you.

Both of them haunts us, we get stuck in a rut and thus don't make efforts in our present, which causes the cycle to continue. 

I want you to know that both past and future are not real, they are figment of imaginations that our brain builds. 

Our brain is structured to picture the worst possible scenarios as defense mechanism. And trust me we can live through all the possible scenarios. 

Humans are adaptable and we can withstand stuff when we face them. To improve our future we need to work on our present , which you can't because we our blinded by past regrets and future uncertainties. 

But just like I said all of that is fiction. So to work on your present. I want you to take time and think about those past fears and regrets that haunt you. 

You can try this exercise : 1) Whenever a thought or fear comes across your brain, try to think about that thought,  you can ask yourself some questions like What am I afraid of? What will happen if the thought comes true? 

2) Then try to list about all of the possibilities that can happen , from the most positive scenarios to the worst possible scenarios. 

3) you can also ask yourself about how can you deal with it. 

4) Think about the probability of the situation happening in future and be logical about it . This can help you understand how illogical our thoughts can be. 

This is called introspection, midfullness, journalling. It will help you to feel better. 

Also please try some exercise , 10 minutes walk would suffice, you can try some beginners 15 minutes yoga , 10 minute meditation , also try to eat healthy. Try to make a schedule of a day that will help you become productive and positive.

I'm making amends where I can, praying to the universe, God, source to help me heal my shame and guilt.

Have you tried to find positive things to fill the void? As for me, I've struggled with depression, anxiety, self-harm and not wanting to live. Therapy, family, friends and church family helped a lot but what helped me most of all was God’s love and free gift of salvation to anyone who believes. I'm in my late 30s now married with kids and I've come a long way since I used to struggle a lot as a teenager. I am so glad I took the time to deal with things and although I relapsed a little I have ultimately been in the clear for many years except anxiety and depression but they have never been as bad as they were then because I have so much more hope and a better perspective now.  I know life can be very hard some days and my greatest hope is that someday God will save us from all this difficulty we have to go through here.  I have also found a lot of contentment in this life in the simple things like just taking a more positive attitude and being thankful.  I hope you can find some solutions.  I have some other resources that helped with this issue if you're interested. Please keep me updated if you want someone encouraging to talk to and let me know if I can help in any way as well.

Maybe for something that gives you energy like a short exercise/walk, reading, eating breakfast, etc., something that is rewarding and enjoyable. After doing that then maybe you'll have the energy to go to work. It would obviously require getting up early and going to bed earlier but adequate sleep is a great contributor to our overall mental health. When I can do something small that I consider personally productive and rewarding the dopamine release combats the cortisol build up. I hope this is encouraging or helpful.

1cxauux,"I was this way last year.I got so desperate I started looking for help elsewhere. Sometimes it’s not the motivation it could be other areas that are lacking. I’m not sure of your situation, but from my experience went through numerous therapist and a psychiatrist. I had one great therapist, but only met once every two weeks. So I still struggled with that. 

My psychiatrist was actually kind or at least concerned. I stressed to her how I need to see someone more than once a week. So she did just that. She would usually meet with me 3 times a week. She saw the areas I was lacking in and helped me with it. Some of the things that were going wrong with me I didn’t even know about or how to fix, but it helped.

- The stray animals, these pets that aren't cared for by their owners, these horrible, horrible cries of the pigs being slaughtered in the neighborhood almost every week. They make me worry for them. They make me so sad. I feel awful because I can barely do anything for them. I live in a country where animal welfare isn't that good, I live with neighbors who own backyard piggeries & yes, sad to say, I have lots of neighbors here who wouldn't even flinch hurting a small cat & no one would dare to defend the poor thing/s. Even me, simply feeding a few strays, get some nasty remarks. God, it's terrible out here! Every time I hear a puppy's little cry outside, or a newly disposed kitten's meows, or knowing someone is going to have a birthday with lechon (roasted pig) my anxiety drives me crazy! Terrible images come to mind. I worry for these creatures' lives. It makes me anxious knowing that anytime someone is going to hurt them. It drives me nuts knowing I can't do anything but cry & pray for them.

1cx9fe7,"I do feel this occasionally. And it's difficult. More than difficult - sometimes it makes me feel like I’m going into a tailspin.

To be honest... I get this feeling when I don’t feel supported or recognized by the people I admired and want to work with.

 I know a lot of people can’t say the same, but I do trust in my own abilities. And I know I have good ideas worth investing in — but feeling like people are speeding ahead without taking me into account: of how much of an asset I can be, how much I have to offer...

It gives me the feeling like there’s something wrong with me and no one’s saying it, or that I do have a lot to offer and no one’s saying anything. It’s kind of maddening. That’s what I associate with the cotton-in-head feeling is when I wonder why I’m not having myself reflected back to me? And if everything is in my head?

I hope that makes sense.

In any case... I’ve realized that I struggle realizing the projects I care most about. It’s really important to me that I create tangible things that I can touch, feel, smell - and it’s hard to parse out how. And how I’d be most satisfied and where and who I’d be most comfortable expressing that with.

I’ve also realized that a lot of the people around me tend to tune me out when they don’t understand something about me, and I have really been undermined because idk what it looked like when people disengaged w/me.

 In any case, I’ve surrounded myself with a lot of people who I feel SHOULD understand me, and go through the motions of understanding me, but definitely don’t. 

They aren’t really attuned to my sense of purpose when I’ve tried to include them with that. 

What I’m trying to explain in all of this is that I usually get a feeling of “feeling left behind” when I feel forgotten about the people around me. 

And this stirs a lot of feelings of self-loathing because I feel people would assume I want help or to be saved from my feelings or circumstances (that I chose), and people making assumptions about my autonomy, agency and independence that isn’t true to what I’m going through.

I feel like I struggle to connect to who I want to be and transform my life around who I want to be. And it'd be nice to have the things I DO achieve and the vision I cultivate acknowledged by the people who I want to care abt me.

Another thing to consider is a lot of people pursue paths that people have taken and have a lot of experience taking. There's a lot of advice because people have already made mistakes for them. 

It's still a lot of work - but if you are trying to be something that needs to be created piece-by-piece, sometimes people don’t know what they’re looking at. 

I think everyone hits that snag sometime in their lives. Very often people have an idea of what they want to be and think I’ll just be x thing and tack my idea onto it! Without realizing that the reason it’s so easy to imagine yourself as X thing, is because people are sold a pre-packaged plan of HOW to become X thing.

So when they get to the thing they actually want to be, they deviate from a very very strict plan and idea of who they’ve become. And when they don’t have a clear vision, and they’ve struggled in a way they hadn’t predicted, they feel a loss of identity bc they’ve strayed from a certain blueprint. 

I think that says a lot about how we conflate things that are obvious/have a clear vision = things that have been done before = important*.

And I think that when someone has goals that are “in-progress"", that warrants a lot of judgement in a way I find unproductive to growing as a person and who may have a unique vision. 

If you’re experiencing this, I don’t think it’s a bad thing you’ve hit this snag early - or you’re still deciding “how” you want to be. I think we get fed lies about ourselves all the time, so I don’t think anyone can be blamed for believing them, but I do think you deserve to be in an internal and external environment that understands the difference between the three*.

1cx9fe7,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences so openly. I can sense the frustration and struggle you are going through in trying to realize your vision and have your abilities recognized by those around you. A few thoughts in response:

First, I empathize with the feeling of being overlooked or undervalued by people you respect and want to collaborate with. When we have confidence in our ideas and abilities, but don't get that validation mirrored back to us, it can breed self-doubt and deflating emotions like you described - the ""cotton-in-head"" feeling and spiral of self-loathing. It's human to crave that recognition, especially from those we admire.

However, I think you make an insightful point that sometimes people simply don't understand or can't see the unique vision we are trying to manifest, especially if it deviates from established paths or pre-existing blueprints. Their inability to grasp our pursuit doesn't diminish its validity or importance. As you said, when we're creating something new and personal to us, people may not know what they're looking at initially.

The journey of self-actualization and bringing a novel vision to life is rarely straightforward. There will be struggles, self-doubts, and times when we feel misunderstood or ""left behind"" as you put it. But those are inherent challenges in forging your own authentic path, not signs that you are off-course or unworthy.

My advice would be to try to divorce your self-worth from the level of validation you receive from others, as hard as that is. Find strength and affirmation within yourself for staying true to your vision. Surround yourself with those who can appreciate and supportthe creative process you are going through, even if they can't fully comprehend the end goal yet. 

And keep taking steps, however small, towards manifesting your ideas into tangible form. Each actualized piece will reinforce your sense of purpose and identity. The path will become clearer as you construct it yourself through consistent efforts.

You have deep self-awareness about what you want to create and the challenges you face. Trust that inner voice that is guiding you, even if you can't yet see the full roadmap. The acknowledgment you seek may or may not come from those you've envisioned - but if you stay faithful to yourself, you will find meaning and fulfillment in your own acknowledgment of living authentically. I wish you perseverance on this journey.",Imaginary-Article-36,True,1716311437.0

As far as advice goes, one thing that has helped me a lot, when I get into mood swings and then into vicious cycles of self hate and confusion as to why I feel this way.

I’ve learned to take a step back and watch my thoughts. These hateful thought about yourself are coming from a part of you that is hurting bad. Try to be a witness to your thoughts, take deep breaths, close your eyes. And just witness these thoughts, not all of them are yours. 

Lastly, always remember you’re trying. And that you did not choose to live this human experience. Being a human is so damn complicated. Our brains , emotions , situations. Were always on go go go. Work work work.  I know you are trying OP, or else you wouldn’t have come here seeking help.

1cx96kv,"One more thing that has helped me-
Whenever you find yourself in the self hate cycle and you’re asking yourself questions in your head like “why do I feel like this?”
“Why am I so ____” “why” “why”

Try switching the “why” to “what” and asking yourself the new question everytime — ***what do I need to stop feeling like this***
*** what do I need to stop thinking about ____***

Because again, it’s normal to feel this overwhelming sense of hate or confusion. It’s just best to mitigate that feeling as much as you can, because nobody deserves to feel that way. Find out what you need to stop feeling these things or thinking about these things. When I switch the question it makes me feel justified in feeling certain ways and then helps me figure out what I can actually do to stop feeling it. It’s not gonna work like magic, but these are tips that have helped me. And remember, it’s okay to feel the way you’re feeling. And it’s okay if these tips don’t instantly work. It’s the fact you’re trying that will make you feel better.",LemonDaddy666,False,1716304268.0

Second: When you're in/falling in love, it's completely normal to want to spend time with your partner bro! Expressing that desire to them without being overbearing or controlling is good, and that sounds like what you're trying to/have done! 


If you have the option, try to close the gap somehow; plan a trip, send something cute in the mail, something that makes y'all's (I assume) long distance relationship not feel so distant.

I don’t know much about data analyst careers, but I am in the marketing field. Out of college I worked corporate and hated it. On a whim to get out of the corporate world I took a job on a political campaign.

It wasn’t the perfect job by any means but I was a whole lot happier doing my work for something I felt was good. I now work for a consulting firm that does mostly communications for environmental nonprofit work. 

From working with so many nonprofits I’ve realized there’s all kinds of folks who work in that industry and it’s an environment I prefer over the corporate mundane.  These folks are incredibly smart and passionate about their work and it empowers me everyday to work harder and learn new things. I work with many folks on the spectrum (they told me) and I often see them excel because they’re able to explore what they are deeply interested in for their work. 

By no means do you need to change your career if that’s not feasible, but there’s absolutely space for data analysts and scientists in the nonprofit realm. I don’t know your particular area of expertise, but the enviro nonprofits I work with have many scientists on their teams to analyze studies, data, etc and then interpret it to be beneficial to legislation and community education.

The whole realm of politics is much much more than just democrat and republican campaigns. Nonprofits in the United States are doing the real and hard work of creating the bills we need to help our country. I highly recommend considering it if this is something that would light your fire!

1cx8qfa,"Thank you for replying. My school workload isn’t massive and my teachers are mostly laid back bar 1 or 2. My school counsellor is kinda notorious for breaking secrecy. I often spend time in the school library as my friends hangout there sometimes. 

I have two separate groups of friends so I will name them A and B: 

Group A has my two closest friends and most of the them know I’m trans. I do however have a complicated relationship with someone from this group. She is rather passive aggressive, flipping between friendly and hostile in moments. I find her difficult because she also refuses to honour my pronouns at basically treats me like an outsider. 

Group B has a couple of my close friends and other than that comprises almost entirely of homo/transphobes. I get on quite well with the select members of this group whilst I find the rest unpleasant. I am not out to any of these people. 

My parents encourage me to do well in school but never put to much pressure on me. They can however be a little over involved in my social/romantic/private life. My school goals are to get a good ATAR (I live in Australia) and go to university for physics or chemistry.

1cx7jcw,"Trying to relate in my own way, I don't have this exact same kind of thing but I've had this ongoing fiction story I've been developing in my mind (without writing anything down so I can change whatever I want about it whenever lol) since I was a teen.  Also in my 30s now.  When alone and just left with my mind idle it kinda just goes towards fantasizing that plot.  I might adapt it into something one day but idk.  Something about its malleability feels comforting.

Otherwise I'll tend to make weird noises by recreating sounds that interested me just because it sounded interesting and I wanted to hear it again or see if I can replicate it myself or something.

I would probably say both of these are escapism too, yeah.  It's taking reality, pushing it aside for a second, and experiencing what I want to experience.  In the case of making random noises it's like indulging in simple pleasures.  Kinda like ASMR in a way.  The fiction story thing prob makes more sense why I consider that escapism.  It's a whole other world lol.

I wouldn't necessarily say one way or another that what you do is a ""problem"" or anything if that's what you're concerned about.  Maybe it's a sign of something and if you have other concerns then it's worth talking to a therapist and bringing up.

But personally, yeah I think it's kind of like a mix of my own two habits.  Both escaping into another world and removing its complexities.  I'm not submissive myself, but I know a sub who told me they believe they're so subby because their regular life is so hard that their fantasies involves basically letting go of being in control and taking a break.

For me it got worse during my apprenticeship as a graphic designer. But the last straw was instagram.
I followed so many artists who seemed to create a masterpiece every damn day. I felt worthless because i need to put so much effort in it amd it still wont be as perfectly drawn, creative or else.

It kept me from drawing and of course i was lacking a huge amount of practise. 

Cutting out instagram was a huge step for me and it helped me a lot. 
I still don't draw as much as before all of that but at least i am having more fun and i can handle errors a lot better now.

To be quite fair, I had always been there for her until I was just burnt out and it totally killed my mental health, so there was no other choice for our friendship other than to end it. I think it's great you were fine with those boundaries. Are you getting any professional help ? It might help a lot, and probably more than talking about it to your friend who might be having the same issues as you. 

Maybe ask her again if you can talk to her about it. And if she says no, then you have your answer. I don't think you should hide not being okay to her. Maybe not go into heavy details, but that's all.

My point of view is that you can talk about those things but only to a certain extent. People often forget there's a difference between a therapist and a friend.

1cx4k0x,I’ll tell you from the perspective of someone that hurt her friends without meaning to. My intentions were pure I really wanted to help avoid conflict and pain. Instead in the end things ended up such that I was the one that caused most of the pain. That’s not something I could live with. I couldn’t look at them in the eye out of guilt. I would think to myself I have no right to look at them and take away their peace of mind. I have no right to upset them any more than I already did. In my situation I felt so guilty I stopped showing up in public and fell into depression. I would say it must be guilt mostly if they have a good conscience.,Idkmanwhatsmyname,False,1716287944.0

It’s the fact they don’t have enough strength or (can’t think of the word to face you). They know what they did was fucked up… and if anything they know they are the furthest thing from being honest. Everyone wants to be real, but everyone isn’t.

1cx4k0x,I know in your case these people have wrong you in a horrible way. I know from my personal experience I pushed one of my dear friends away to the point they thought I was angry at them. I had so much going on at that point in my life that I wrongly took it out on them. I had a great friendship with this person and I've always regretted my action and still have that guilt constantly. I've wanted to apologize but I know there was no excuse for my action and I figured this person wouldn't want to hear it.

Whatever it is, they can go shove whatever it is up their backside.

1cx48sm,"Sam is neurodivergent with a double whammy of ASD and ADHD. Let’s try and look at it from Sam’s perspective. Remember, Sam is neurodivergent which often results in the brain’s pre-frontal cortex (the CEO of the brain) not functioning properly. At those times, it is not able to tell the part of the brain (called Executive Function) what is appropriate behaviour.

So when Jack placed the chair, it wasn’t exactly where Sam (ASD are usually very black and white thinkers) needed it. When Jack said it was fine (doesn’t matter how politely), Sam was getting stressed about the placement of the chair. Sam starts to get overwhelmed and his Executive Function is shutting down. He is about to have a meltdown. When Sam has this meltdown, external consequences are no where in his brain. The fact there is a scene on stage is not on Sam’s radar. The only thing on his radar is a chair in a wrong position with Jack telling him it’s fine. Again remembering that the Executive Function is not working so Sam has no concept that his threat to Jack is all part of Sam’s meltdown (it is the ASD term). From Sam’s perspective, Jack doesn’t need a specific apology because Sam’s meltdown was caused by Jack putting the chair where he did. Sam probably remembers the chair but it is possible he doesn’t remember the meltdown or he is waiting for an apology from Jack for getting him kicked off the show and suspended. Remembering, in Sam’s neurodivergent mind, societally he really hasn’t done anything wrong to Jack. He is capable of empathy because he messaged and apologised to others affected out but nowhere has singled out the Jack incident, because it was a non incident. That could be how Sam see it play out which puts a different perspective. I hope he is seeing someone to help him read cues etc.

Here is another reason to support him now. As he goes through life he is actually going to have fuck all friends (this whole incident is a clear example why). Neurodiverse adults tend not to be able to make and then keep friends. If there is any question about whether I provide support to a neurodivergent, I will. Even if I know the relationship with the person will be short, it will be one of the few times in their lives when they get someone to actually listen to them.

You decide what is right (not necessarily popular), have the courage (whichever path you take) to make the decision, and stick to it.",HuckyBuddy,False,1716290367.0

I’m sorry for all the stuff that happened and i hope you and “jack” are safe 
personally as someone who has autism i understand where sam is coming from and how no matter what it controls you most things feel so much more intense and personal. but with the multiple alterations i feel like it’s better for both you and jack should have space from sam. i could lead to something worse where he could act on his thoughts but i feel that make sure that sam has other ppl that make him feel alright or a support system as it could get worse or dwell with him

1cx0nmc,"do trade school in the future!! find a trade you really like and learn a lot about it. you will not be homeless and broke. a different schooling environment such as online or a different school in a smaller town may be beneficial for you to take yourself away from the stressors and constant reminders of school beyond the grade you’re in. what you’re feeling is so normal and i felt exactly like this at your age, no hope for anything beyond right now. middle school is such a tough time lol, i hope you feel better.",JealousMarch9805,False,1716272822.0
1cx0nmc,"Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to go to college to be successful. If it's desk work/busy work/sitting down that you're bored of and hate doing, that's fine actually. Consider going to trade school and getting an apprenticeship in something like mechanical work, nursing or welding. Those are just some options, there's more than that you'll just need to do your research on what you're good at and interested in.

If you don't want to pursue a trade and you actually enjoy desk work but just hate having to learn everything under the sun because the American education system has to cater to the widest audience possible, you could always go to a 1-2 year technical school. It's like college for an extra year or two to get your technical or associates degree and/or to get any certifications in your career field.

And then there's always the option to join the military. The military is severely overlooked imo. Most civilian jobs you have to work to get paid, meaning unless you have an awesome job (rare) whenever you're sick or have to call out of work you have to use vacation days or you just don't get paid at all. In the military (all branches) you get paid for every day you're contracted with them for, meaning that regardless of if you actually work or not you get paid. You're guaranteed vacation days, I take an entire month of vacation every year for instance, and you're guaranteed promotions and pay raises every year until you hit E-4. It has the added benefit of free healthcare, dental, vision and hearing care. Oh and if you change your mind about college they will pay you to go to college, or you can wait until you get out of the military and if you served for at least 1-3 years you get what's called the GI Bill. The GI Bill will pay your college tuition, pay for books and supplies, pay for your food while you're in school, and it also will pay for your housing. Oh and after you get out of the military you get free health insurance for the rest of your life through the VA, you get veteran discounts until you die, and if you served for 20+ years you can retire because the government will pay you what's called a pension, basically you'll make anywhere from 6,000-9,000 a month until you die just for existing.

Another option you should consider is just asking your family what their opinions are but I understand that's not always the easiest thing to do.

If you have any questions feel free to ask them. Just understand that you're the one that has to find what's best for you.",ConstantlyAl0ne,False,1716290145.0

1cx0nmc,"The most difficult years of my life were grades 3 to 5, and then grades 9 through 11.  Being a kid/teenager is tough, and everything can feel really bleak.  You go through so much emotionally, socially, academically, not to mention physically!  The years are fraught with change, which isn't helped by the runaway hormones.  All you can do to get through it is find some support, and hopefully a friend or two you can talk to and relate with.  

If college isn't your thing that is fine.  My personal recommendation is that you don't worry about that yet.  Right now you focus on smaller goals, like getting good marks in your classes right now.  School can be hard, and it sucks sometimes for sure, but it is necessary for being able to live as an adult in society.  The more you dedicate yourself to your studies in high school, the more doors that will open to you after graduation.  

When you are in high school, make sure to sign up for practical courses to help you figure out what you might be interested in doing.  Try shop classes like woodworking and metal working, mechanics, home economics (maybe you will want to be a chef or clothing designer).  Keep your options open and try as much as you can at this time.  

Last, I totally feel you about the homeless and broke fear.  I live it every day.  It is what motivates me to get out of bed and go to work each day.  If you take the proper steps now, you will make the chances of being broke and homeless much smaller.  Pass high school, even better, do well in high school, and find something you want to do for awhile.  Remember nothing is forever, or at least it doesn't have to be.  People change jobs and careers all the time.  So you do you.  Also I would like to say that I was not ready for college after high school.  I travelled for a year and then worked retail for about 6 years before I decided to go to college.  Had I to do it over again, I would have gone into a trade after high school (I always enjoyed welding).  

Anyway, take it easy on yourself.  You are going through one of, if not the, most difficult times of your life.  You are doing great, and your future is bright.  All the best.",lesla222,False,1716291827.0

1cwyuwz,"Wassup my man!! first off thanks for sharing your troubles and your troubles are totally valid. I myself am a 21yo M headed into my Sr. year of university and I can really resonate with what you’re saying. 

You gotta realize it’s your life at the end of the day and not moms. It’s obvious you don’t like the banking job and at the age we’re at in our early 20s it’s important and appropriate to make these big decisions for the betterment of YOU!! not just to please others. Ik it’s especially difficult as you are adhering to your mother and what you think she wants for you. From a family dynamic if you haven’t told her about crying yourself to sleep and how hard your are struggling I highly suggest you do. Family is there to support and love, I would hope your mom would listen to you and have some understanding or empathy wanting what’s best for you and your mental. This comes with time ofc, saying no to others and speaking up for yourself is definitely difficult and a learned skill. That being said I think you should definitely leave the job being the largest factor in your conflicts, but there’s a right way of doing so.

If I were in your shoes I would start applying for internships or larger more professional jobs that you would have a genuine interest in. Follow through and try and land something while still employed at the bank. If you do get something hopefully it’s something that has better hours for you or something you enjoy. Only then I would have that hard conversation with mom. It’s vital you prep for this conversation explaining the logistics and how everything has already planned out and thought through saying something like you’ll be transferring into another internship or job that’s better for you and you planned it out not leaving anytime to be unemployed. 

If you can’t get an internship as fast as you would like apply to a few smaller jobs like papa John’s and other little gigs. Suggest maybe working 2 part time jobs at the same time (would be even better if you found one in person and one online so you can maybe work 2 at the same time schedule).

It’s all about perspective, enjoy the little moment, enjoy the people and interactions, and look for the good in every day.

Changing the way you think is a big part of it and it's not easy to do. There is something called cognitive distortions, these are basically negative thought patterns.

An example would be ""jumping to conclusions"" or sometimes called mind reading.  

Maybe you text your girlfriend and she never responded all day. Someone might think ""she is cheating on me, I'm not good enough for her."" The idea is to challenge these automatic negative thoughts. ""Maybe she forgot to charge her phone again"" "" I think she said she's visiting her family today, maybe she was too busy"" ect.

There are a lot of cognitive distortions so training yourself to catch them is the first step. Then you challenge them and slowly you change the way you think to be more positive and not automatically negative. It's actually really hard and takes a lot of practice.

I understand it must be tough going back into a phase that you got out of but what worked for me (30M) is really trying to do something exciting or something to look forward to throughout my day.

So what I'd do is randomly just take my partner out for dinner to any of our favourite places or buy my mom gifts or just anything really that could make me forget about my job life. I understand the anger, trust me I've been working in the same company for 7 years now and the first 5 years was honestly hell.

Eventually things improved tremendously, and they will for you too! Just keep going but one thing I would really like to emphasize on is DO NOT RAGE especially not on the people you love. A really good friend of mine committed suicide because he got angry at his wife and she divorced him due to that. I know things are hard but they won't be hard forever. Just have one thing to look forward to in the week and Eventually each day changes and becomes better.

Covid was a different story for me, never got vaccinated, finally got it and I’ve had a flu that was worse. However when it first happened I was terrified and the media didn’t help. It also sounds like you’ve had Covid and you survived.

Anyways, I thought I'd share this technique I have for dealing with triggers. It's a journal entry where I go through questions that help me process the event.

Here are the prompts:

- Date

- What happened? (stick to objective facts here)

- How did you feel? (emotionally, physically)

- What did you think? (you can write about assumptions you had about other people or judgements)

- What did you do? (describe any confrontation or lack of)

- What was your fantasy? (write about your ideal confrontation, including how the other people would respond)

- What was the trigger? (try to distill it down to a sentence)

- What are your thoughts on the trigger?

- What is the earliest memory (in childhood) of this trigger upsetting you?

You could add another one, like ""If you could travel back in time to your younger self, what would you say or do to protect yourself or help you manage the traumatic event?""

I think a visualization exercise could help here too. The key is to really sit with your feelings in order to move through them. An exercise I try sometimes when I deal with anxiety or fear in particular is telling myself ""it's okay if \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ happens.""

1cwvk7z,"Hi! First i want to mention i am not a medical professional and this is based on research and experience. It sounds like depersonalization/derealization. This can be caused by anxiety and trauma as you mentioned. Other causes can be ongoing depression, substance abuse, and high stress environments. Depersonalization is the feeling of being disconnected to your body. This can present in ways such as feeling like you’re detached, feeling your body and mind doesn’t belong to you. My personal experience felt as though there was a thin glass between me and the world. It felt like I was stuck and I didn’t have to function because it didn’t feel like my body. I felt like when people spoke to me i didn’t need to respond because i didn’t feel real in my body. Feeling like you’re in a dream is most common with derealization. It can cause distortions in your perception and surroundings. Usually this happens because your mind feels it’s in harm or danger. if it feels overwhelming your mind try’s to protect you by detaching. It’s a horrible thing to deal with. It took a lot of acceptance to improve mine. I used to feel it constantly and it would cause lots of anxiety. Now it comes occasionally when my body is stressed or tired. I would always tell myself my body is just trying to help and protect me. “i’m safe” “im real”. grounding techniques and therapy can help some people. don’t be afraid to reach out and get help from professionals if it interferes with your life.",mara_gurl,False,1716260041.0

You could take skills from sports to get good at something else, I ended up enjoying running after all that, and would start running to get into shape and that led to hiking every now and then.

1cwul8d,"It's never too late to start to get to know yourself 🙂 It's not easy, but developing a strong connection with myself greatly helped me attain more fulfillment in life. Not trying to give unwanted advice, but just thought I'd share what helped me. 

For me, the process itself became my goal. To remain open to learning more about yourself everyday, to be able to delve deep, to be able to see yourself in the most honest light, and not according to what's being expected of you. 

A person grows and changes throughout life, and it's ok to not know what you want or who you are at times. It helped to put myself out there, outside of my comfort zone to see what I was really about and what I stood for. It was very stressful at first, but it got much easier with practice. Experienced new things, talked to different people with different perspectives, welcomed new insights. 

I learned to nurture my curiousity. A hunger to learn helps keep conversations moving and worthwhile. Itough for the introvert, but once I got more comfortable in my exploration/learning mindset, I was surprised to find I was actually more social than I thought. 

If people were welcoming of discussions with me, I asked them questions about their life experiences and how those experienced shaped their perspective and beliefs, asked about anything and everything they were comfortable talking about. At times I uncovered ideas and values that resonated with me, learned new likes/dislikes.

What you described about your childhood and the resulting feeling of emptiness is something that hit close to home for me. It hurts to see others go through that experience because I understand the hollow quite well. Once I was able to physically leave that environment, I struggled to leave mentally and emotionally.

Repressing my individuality was familiar, all I ever knew. But that became a huge obstacle to my progress in life. Realized it's my duty to know myself. It became important to not allow my mind to stay confined by my past, so I strive to keep pushing myself.

It can get better. Just try not to close yourself off to life and its opportunities for growth. 

I hope you found something helpful here and truly wish you the best on your journey!

1cwue9a,"Thanks so much. I'm sorry about your pregnancy difficulties and hope all is going well now. I appreciate you. I had some time to reflect and feel a lot better. Feel free to ignore below, just feels good to get my thoughts down:

I felt judged and hurt when the person made the comments about my anxiety but she only made them because she felt judged and hurt by my comments. Her comment came from a wounded place, even though she tried to make it sound like it was coming from a place of superiority. She thinks I don't care/ understand her pain and thus she was even more dismissive and condescending about my pain. And that's ok because she's been through something completely devastating. I see her pain and I understand it's about that and nothing personal to me. 

She seems to assume I'm just scared of feeling negative things which makes me feel really unseen as she does not know what I have experienced in my life. But what I experienced is real and how I cope and recover from it my problem and I'm doing it as well as I can.

My comment was not made will ill intentions but it is an emotional subject and people are going to make their judgements and assumptions. This has actually been healing to me because I've held a lot of resentment towards people for what they have said to me in the past and this lesson is showing me that I should not just take my interpretation and cling to it. Most people probably had better intentions than I give them credit for and trying to vilify and dissect their words only leads to more disconnection.

In the past I would have apologized profusely to everyone in the comments who was unhappy with me but I feel more confident now knowing that if they are reacting this way to a stranger, then it can't be about me and there's no need to redeem myself.

I also understand that not everyone understands anxiety and how bad it is. They don't understand occasional worries vs actual debilitating anxiety. Heck, I didn't even understand it even when I had it. I literally thought my constant panic was just a normal way of being. When I was a teenager, I would think my sister's panic attacks were funny cause I thought she was just being silly or something. So of course someone who doesn't understand this would think it's reproachable to be worried about it compared to pregnancy loss.

I am going to be a good mom. Despite the commenter's suggestions, I've actually come a long way with my anxiety. I have had periods in the past where I could barely function because I literally thought I was going to die of some random health issue and I would not be able to pull myself away from googling and reading about the same ailments over and over again. I would literally read the same articles 100 times in a day. That's one example and there are many more and I've overcome a lot of them. My pregnancy anxiety is not nearly as bad as it could have been if I hadn't been working on it for years. 

I am going to be accountable to my kids when I mess up and do want to teach them to deal with negative emotions. I hope to not yell at them but if I do I will apologize and always say it is wrong to lose my temper. I will never abuse them physically.

After a few days of moving this sand pile back and forth, prisoners started running into electrified fences and MG gun fire to commit suicide.  The point is that life has to have some intrinsic point or reason for living.  

The cure?  You need to become others oriented.  That looks like helping other people, helping others with their needs and being intentional with other people.   God made us to serve one another.

It is 100% unethical, unprofessional, and not okay what happened here. Under no circumstances is a mental health professional EVER supposed to yell at their patients. It is literally their job to be objective, to analyze behaviors, and to be understanding. I don't care what you said, your body language, your tone, or what she was going through, none of those things make it acceptable for her behavior. Please, please, please, report her. This woman is in a position of literally holding lives in her hands. Humans naturally have walls in place to protect themselves from trauma, when you go into a therapist, it is literally their job to get you to take down those walls within the safe place that they create for you to do so. This makes you extremely vulnerable and they are trained specifically to take extreme caution. She violated your trust, she violated her terms of contract as a therapist, and in some states, she violated the law. I implore you to report her, not for yourself alone, but for anyone else she could do this to. A child in her care with suicidal ideation and extreme trauma - outbursts like that in a therapy session CAN cause suicides. When you trust someone to be objective and they treat you that way, a vulnerable person can take that so deeply to heart that it is literally the last nail in their coffin. What she mentioned to you about her personal life is a violation, while therapists can mention their personal lives in a way that allows them to connect with you, anything else is not allowed. If she was sensitive that day and had an emotional outburst, she should have taken a mental health leave of absence as to make sure she didn't act exactly this way with patients. If she was having issues, she should have said, ""I apologize for making you feel that way, it wasn't my intention, but I think that maybe I might not be therapist for you. You should have a therapist you trust, so I would like to recommend you to another.""

I know this is hard, I know that you're going to let this eat you alive, but I promise you I have absolutely no doubts whatsoever that you are not to blame for this. Short of threatening her in a physical manner, there is no excuse. She should be fired and her license suspended pending review.

It was my choice to tell her or not and he took it from me. He understood the trust it broke.  I have reached out immediately to BetterHelp for now to see if I can get matched with an online counselor but this I know truly damaged me.

it sucks",Actual-Inside39,False,1716299091.0
1cwt0pn,"This happened to me when I was a child too, 14 years old - the judge said me and my abuser would have separate therapists - but it was the same lady seeing us both separately (and sided with my abuser too!). At my sessions she’d treat me like trash and make excuses for my abuser. Even though I’d been promised by the judge that I’d never have to go to a joint therapy session with my abuser, the therapist ambushed me with her one day. I called for my ride and walked out.

1cwt0pn,I reluctantly agreed because she’s licensed in techniques for PTSD that only a handful of people around here are and we live a good distance away from the others.  I’d have to take a half day a week to see them. I agree whole heartedly it was dumb on my part.,Shortnsassygrl,True,1716294695.0

1cwt0pn,Yes I’m comfortable.  I have ptsd and we started talking about one of my childhood events. We’d get to the worst of it all and time would be up.  We constantly talked about hypno and light therapy to help but we would come in and she’d push me to bring up another traumatic event and then time would be up.  It started getting to really heavy stuff I told her but with no guidance on how to handle the trauma.  She was great at giving me tips for grounding myself in panic attacks on minor things but I had this flood of memories opened and they were very traumatic.,Shortnsassygrl,True,1716330451.0

I can tell you in the situation I told her it made me uncomfortable, I was not aggressive (part of my issues are that I’m very passive and don’t speak up and bringing up it made me uncomfortable was hard for me to do).  She literally stopped me as I was talking and said “I’m stopping you right there”, the minute I said I felt somewhat betrayed and said “I’m very ethical and never breach confidentiality,  do you know what I’m going through? I found out this——. I’m very angry and this is over”.  She then walked to the door and said “no one questions my ethics, goodbye.”  I’ve been to other therapist and the only reason the care ended was because I moved.

A word of caution, most people don't leave reviews when they like a service, so not seeing many good reviews doesn't mean that the therapist would or wouldn't be good for you.

1cwpdyb,"I feel like you are experiencing prolonged extreme stress, this comes naturally with school work (even more so with a major you particularly don't enjoy) and it also is a (or partially) a result of the people you care about seemingly caring about you less as well as being away from your home. I'm sure you know what stress feels like but different kinds of stress feel different and can be confusing as it's a new feeling, and can manifest into physical (or other) problems. For example, I was experiencing prolonged extreme stress for so long that I developed PNES and started having seizures regularly, Panic attacks are commonly a result of high stress levels. When you hold your emotions in (or suppress them)  that increases your stress levels significantly, and without someone whom you can share your feelings and/or experiences with it can become very serious very quickly and can be scary. To conclude this I would say you are experiencing high stress as a result of everything (and possibly more) you mentioned in this post.

In my opinion, you do not want to change yourself for other people, because then you won't be who you truly are and you may start feeling like you lost touch with your true self. and it is difficult to mask your true self for others and when eventually you end up showing your true self they will perceive it as if you lied to them about who you are and you may accidentally hurt them. I can relate to nobody staying because all my friends have left me as well and I am completely alone, similarly to you I also tried to be as good of a person as I could and nobody cared and/or used me. Those types of people are not who you want to befriend anyway because in the end, they will make you feel worse, but there are people out there who can understand you and will make you feel better you just need to find them, they are rarer but still exist.

1cwomrg,"Hiii! i want to note i am not a psychologist and this is based on research and personal experience. i’m sorry to hear you’re going through such a rough time for so long. i’ve struggled with derealization/dissociation for about 6 years now. i know that may be frightening to hear but it hardly bothers me anymore. dissociation can be triggered by trauma, anxiety and certain mental disorders. dissociation is not there to hurt you it’s actually there cause your mind feels the need to protect you. i spent sooo long trying to get it to stop and that’s an exhausting and disappointing cycle. i found the most helpful thing for me was realizing it was there to help me. maybe think back to when it started for you and figure out if there was any trauma around that time. if there was maybe begin to process through that trauma. remind yourself that you’re safe. there are also grounding techniques that can help as well as therapy. everyone’s experience is sooo different. just know that if your mind feels the need to distance from reality then that’s okay. sometimes our mind feels the world is too much for us so it wants to give us a break. it’s frightening when it’s happening just remind yourself that’s a symptom of a different issue. i wish you the very best and just know you are not alone and i understand the fear, exhaustion, and depression it can cause.",mara_gurl,False,1716245778.0

1cwomrg,"Based on my personal experience of dissociation (and different people are likely to have different experiences), I think it is the mind (Ego) using constant, compulsive and automatic thinking to try and disassociate us from being present and feeling the unpleasant sensations in our body. It is a vicious cycle, because fear-based hyperthinking produces unpleasant fear/stress emotions, which produce more fear-based thoughts, and so on.

For me, getting out of dissociation requires detaching myself from the thoughts/mental stories the Ego is producing through meditation.",lalansmithee,False,1716285998.0

1cwo3xl,"# [How is paranoia treated?]()

Treatment depends on the cause and severity of symptoms and may include medication and [psychotherapy](https://www.healthline.com/health/psychotherapy). Psychotherapy aims to help people with paranoia:

* accept their vulnerability
* increase their self-esteem
* develop trust in others
* learn to express and handle emotions in a positive manner

Treatment for paranoid personality disorder usually involves psychotherapy to help you develop coping skills to improve socialization and communication. Sometimes, doctors prescribe anti-anxiety medication to treat paranoid personality disorder for people who are often anxious or fearful. Atypical antipsychotic medications may also help.

People with paranoid schizophrenia usually require medication, as they often have lost touch with reality. Initial treatment usually includes antipsychotic medication. Your doctor may also prescribe anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants.

Your doctor may recommend additional treatment once your condition has stabilized. This can include psychotherapy and individual or family counseling.

When paranoia is a result of drug abuse, treatment is often supportive until the drug effects wear off. After that, your doctor will likely encourage you to participate in a drug treatment program.",Andrewoholic,False,1716234400.0

No one is inherently bad, unless we’re talking serious crimes, but most people make mistakes - it’s about how we deal with those mistakes and take on responsibility for our actions and put things right - so our future doesn’t repeat itself.

Hide behind doctors. I've won so many court cases against the state with their help.

Human society is made up of tribes, roughly 150ish people, Dunbar's number. Bullies single out people who would fit well within the role of shaman, the quiet one who prefers being in the hut. Bullies do this to all the people like they run into, eventually singling themselves out, becoming reactionary and egotistical forever. The geek if they carry on and endure will be scooped up by a tribe at some point who will protect you from these people.

Remember it's not alpha-chimp go wiirrr, but alpha-omega, the shaman and chief paradigm. Once you meet a chief, you'll become invincible and all your fears will disappear. The adult world is run by tribes.

Doctors are powerful. When will people realize? Now you know. Nazis wouldn't even shoot medics. You could go full AHAB with them on your bullies, get them kicked out, a restraining order put upon and sue the families. They would win it for you, but you need medical records of your events.

At the end of the day once everyone graduates and starts working and gets to the point where they have to support themselves they’ll start to learn they aren’t hot shit or cool and likely start to regret what they did to the people they bullied. Focus on your school and get yourself prepared for a good professional job early so you can support the things you want to do when you’re older. I can guarantee you as someone who interviews for the company I’m working at that personality is 90% of getting hired. If you’re nice, involved in helping to grow the company/your profession. I promise you’ll do far better in the future than the people bullying you. Not only that but it’s a much smaller world than people think. I’ve seen people I knew from school apply at my work for jobs and the input I had for the rest of the interview panel on their past played a huge role in hiring. Who knows, you could be on the interview panel for one of your bullies one day and you’ll be able to tell them where they can stick their resume. I know that got a little off topic but it’s something I wish someone had told me when I was still in school. Just ignore them and focus on personal growth.",ShootingGuns10,False,1716249893.0
1cwlwjx,First thing first talk to your parents about this no matter what and see what your parents will do about this situation your parents can call the school to say you need a little bit of time and I’m sure your parents will do a lot of other things to help you get through this and even maybe stopping this from happening again! Tbh I’m no good advice so just check the other comments,JeremyMinecraft,False,1716252863.0
1cwlwjx,"Reflecting on my school days in the early '90s, I recall being targeted by bullies, perhaps due to our lack of trendy attire. Yet, the rise of the grunge era, which embraced a more 'down-to-earth' style, made our appearance somewhat acceptable. The school social scene was divided, with 'freaks' on one side and 'preps' on the other. My experience taught me that bullies lose interest when their taunts seem ineffective. This lesson has stayed with me into adulthood, where, even past 40, I encounter workplace bullying.

Bullies often act out due to their own struggles, such as family issues or emotional turmoil. I've found that confronting them with genuine concern can sometimes defuse their aggression. This approach, however, is most effective in one-on-one interactions, where they're more likely to drop their guard.

Over the years, I've observed a pattern: many bullies fail to thrive later in life, while those they once tormented often achieve success. The 'nerds' have become doctors, the 'quiet ones' have risen to government positions, and others have had distinguished military careers.

There are instances where a bully might seek your help, leading to an unexpected alliance. They may not become friends, but they could become defenders against further bullying. The film ""Lucas"" from the '80s illustrates the power of authenticity and resilience, themes that resonate deeply with me.

As an adult, I've taken a firm stand against bullying, drawing inspiration from characters like The Punisher. I've never had to resort to violence; my demeanor alone is enough to command respect and stop bullies in their tracks. Despite my tough exterior, I'm actually quite calm and lighthearted, and I use this to guide those who've gone astray. I believe in laughter and fun, but not at the expense of others. It's wrong to demean someone, especially if they're vulnerable. My stance is clear: we should all strive to be kind and protect those who cannot protect themselves.

Whatever you do you do not owe them an apology. They should have been taking care of you… not the other way around. They can‘t demand shit. Your family’s problems aren’t yours. They need to take accountability.

Your whole family does.

1cwid92,"Autism assessment at 17? I wish I was rich. I’m 22 and it costs me close to 5k for an assessment.

You should talk to a doctor about anxiety. Iirc from experience that’s what this is stemming from.

Also look up E2020, it’s a online schooling lots of public schools used during and even after Covid, might get you your diploma without having to go back to school again. Just keep in mind something that bugs you this too much you should try to conquer those things so they’re not controlling of you later on. During Covid I couldn’t leave my house and had panic attacks everytime I did, only thing that fixed it was spending more time outside.",Spinelli_The_Great,False,1716220682.0
1cwid92,Therapy and such is payed for where I live but I still have to wait months for my first therapy appointment and don't feel comfortable going to my regular doctor bc they treat mental health stuff in a weird way,h0useplan_t,True,1716221062.0
1cwid92,"Yeah they do, when I asked my doctor for an autism assessment he just laughed and I found that quite offensive being most of my problems in life seem to stem from just that (I’ve been told I’m autistic my entire life from my parents to teachers but I grew up poor so the assessment wasn’t in question being my parents decided not too when I was a child) 

Honestly, if you don’t wanna wait for therapy there’s online sources that can help if you look deep enough. I saved myself about $500 googling how to communicate with my wife on certain topics by finding some bullshit article with thoughts behind it and learned from that. Not saying it’ll always help but sometimes somebody does post something worth the read and it’s legit advice in there and can save you lots of money and time being it might be the exact same thing your doctor or therapist might say. 

I really hope things get better for you OP, I know I conquered my bullshit, I believe you can too.",Spinelli_The_Great,False,1716221232.0

1cw4jln,"First of all, I want to commend you for reaching out and sharing your feelings. It takes a lot of courage to be vulnerable, especially when you're feeling low. It sounds like you're going through a really tough time right now, and it's important to remember that you're not alone. And also, welcome to Reddit :)

I've had periods in my life when I felt similarly. Like an empty shell. It's a horrible feeling. I was dealing with a depression. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying what you have is depression. Only a mental health professional can assess that. But it does sound very similar and maybe you should reach out to a professional to find out.

Did any specific thing happen that started this period of feeling numb? 

You mention feeling useless. What makes you feel like this? And how often do you have this feeling? It might be helpful for you to explore these thoughts and feelings in a systematic way using a CBT journal. It's a method based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that can help you challenge unhelpful thoughts like that and replace it with a new perspective that can help you find joy again.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Many people have gone through similar experiences and have found ways to cope and feel better. It's a process, and seeking help is a strong and positive first step.

Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out for professional help if you need it.

Wishing you all the best on your journey to feeling better. Hang in there!",Umbertina2,False,1716413345.0

I started feeling that way around your age too. I had abuse as a teen and those things came up as suicidal thoughts. 
It's good you are reaching out to others for help, that's mature. More. Mature than I have been. I hate sharing with others face to face. That's why the internet serves me so well. 

I am not here to say. Cheer up, it may never happen, smile and the world smiles with you. I believe that's all bollocks and infact hinders any real discovery. 
Bad things will happen, it's up to us how we deal with them. 

There is always a good and bad way to view things. I hope your choose to view them in a positive light.

Shit happens, get on with it. Others suffer far more. You can either make the situation bad or make it positive.

1cwa3n4,"Realize what im about to tell you is going to be hard, but life is not always supposed to be easy.  If you decided to change your life, it's going to be an uphill battle, but its Worth It.  So here's what you should do to start off (take it or leave it, or change it to fit).

1. Get up, put an alarm in your bathroom that forces you to get up to shut it off, when you're in there brush your teeth (whether you want to or not).

2. Once you've done that, go grab water downstairs and take a walk, every single day rain or shine. Whether it's to the corner or around the block, you've gotta get your body moving again.  Eventually if you decide to join a gym that's a great step.

3.  When your parents scream at you, hear what they're saying, but don't let it tear you down.  Using any negative emotions (anger, rejection, frustration, pain, etc) to grow and learn. You can use it to push you to work your body out, to read a book on how to change your life (there are plenty of them [The Holy Bible is definitely one id keep with you and read every night]).  Anything that they tell you that is productive, write it down and learn from it.

4. Stop calling out of work unless you are absolutely unable to make it.  Push through the idea of just staying home, realize it may such to go to work, but you don't know what that work day may bring.

5.  Eat 3 meals a day.  Start off with a healthy breakfast.  Eggs can be great to keep on track, but eat vegetables with it.  Lunch is important. Eat a high protein lunch that supports growth and health (ham sandwich and peanut butter on celery sticks).  Dinner: A salad with croutons is a good step.

6. Before you go to bed, take a shower, brush your teeth after you're done, and then set the alarm for the next day.  You don't need to wash your hair every day, but your body is a must. 

These 6 steps should help you, but now it's time you hear the harder part.  This is the quitting phase of it.

7. Quit any born that you may be indulging in.  If you don't do anything like that, then that's great.  Disregard this step.

8. Limit your video gaming time.  2 hours a day at most until you've gotten into healthy habits.  Starting and finishing up to 3 hours before bed, leaving the shower.  For example, if you're going to bed at 10 p.m., stop gaming at 8 pm.

9. Get off social media, specifically YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram.  Unless you're learning something from YouTube, you should not use it, and instagram is just a comparison game for people, so don't use it.  Twitter is a bunch of stuff that won't help you.  If you do use social media, then don't use it for more than an hour a day, read, or do other activities to occupy your time.

Finally, this one is something for you to take to heart.

10.  No one is perfect on this big blue ball we live on. Every day, people are dying and being born.  Some are thriving, and some are barely surviving.  You have the choice each and every day. God wakes you up to say, ""I am here, and I have a choice.""  You deserve a long, happy, and healthy life.  You have to make the choice to change your life.  Some moments will be harder than others. Some will seem impossible, but you've got to keep pushing forward!  Do not give up. Your life can improve so drastically if you just keep trying.  It does not matter if you fail one day, but it matters if you get up and try again.

If you are apathetic and have zero motivation then create some by making your immediate environment less tolerable, and less comfortable, and less preferable to other places. That way you don’t rot away but you go to the other places that are less bad. Eventually after the bugger-off adjustment period where things feel pretty awful you’ll get into a rhythm and things will become better. It’ll take like three months, possibly a bit more.

When I was a teenager and I went to the doctor's for the first time about my mental health,  I got told that I was just hormonal (I'm a female) and that it was normal to spend everyday wanting to die lolll. I've been dragged through the dirt when it comes to accessing mental health services as the public health service in my country hasn't quite got their mental health support right yet unless you pay for private care but I have a pretty good doctor now who actually seems to care about her patients. 

It really sucks when you're young because you can't make your own decisions about who treats you etc, but is there anybody who you can talk to, for example at school maybe? Most schools will have a councillor who you can speak to or another similar role, such as  a pastoral care person. I would go and speak to them as I think that that would be a good place to start. Make sure to mention that you aren't being given support by either your parents or your assigned doctor and that your condition is really affecting your daily life to the point where you feel that you cannot function normally anymore. I wish that I could give you more advice but it is just really rubbish being a kid with a mental health problem and no support. :( 

Eventually though, it will get better. For me, I had to leave that particular living situation with my family to get on the path to feeling better and I still suffer now, but having your independence will help massively. Again though, speak to a trusted adult at your school to see if they can help to improve things for you.

1cw7sj4,"I think you should reevaluate how you view yourself, and I have this same issue. You're not a slut, you're not a bad student or a bad daughter, or even a bad in general. You're a person who's hurting and in need of help. Unfortunately life gave you the short straw, but it's not about how many times you fail, or how other people see you, what matters is how you treat yourself and how you pick yourself back up whenever you fall.

Your life has worth and value, and often it's hard to see that. I don't think you should solve a temporary situation with a permanent solution, you should definitely give it time for these issues to resolve itself. Life will go on and people will come and go.

Also if you need any financial help I'm not very wealthy but I'm willing to help you out if you truly need it. I would suggest trying to move to a more affordable area than Florida, but I get that's easier said than done.

I bear witness to that .

1cw6rjo,"Parent-Child relationships are really tough, especially depending on the generation.
Rather than answer the general question of if adult children have obligations to their parents, and to that I would say it really depends, I will address the specific situation.

If I'm understanding this right, it seems your mom expected you to do something for her the moment she called, without regard for your current situation potentially not being ideal to meet that request. Now, personally I feel that whether or not you are involved in this trip changes if you are obligated to participate in the planning at all: if this is a personal trip for your mom or your parents, referencing her to some sites or engaging in light chit chat about potential destinations is plenty supportive on your part, while if it's an immediate family trip that includes you I think it is reasonable for her to expect a little more effort on your part. However, even it you are involved in the trip, expecting you to drop everything same day/hour to plan it is inconsiderate. 

If I were in your position, I would say something like ""I would love to help more with this when I have the time. I will have a little bit more free time on X day and will let you know what I come up with then."" Of course as long as you determine helping falls within your responsibilities or an extra kindness you are willing and able to offer. This kindly let's mom know you do intend to be a part of the planning even though right now is not a good time for you.

Now, holding birthing and raising efforts over children is unfortunately not uncommon. Without getting too into it, the responsibility of birthing and raising a child are assumed when... someone decides to give birth to and raise, as opposed to adopt out, a child. Depending on the parent and the generation this point might be harder to get across, but you can still appreciate the pains and efforts that went into bringing you to adulthood while also recognizing that your relationship with your previous caretakers has changed. Effectively, you are not in debted to them because they fed you and kept a roof over your head during the years that they were legally required to do so because you were a minor and not capable of providing for yourself. And maybe it was more glamorous than that, but suffice it to say they accepted that responsibility and it is in the past now. Evaluate where your relationship is at in the present, what each of you currently brings to the table, and decide from there if this is something you can reasonably budget to keep the relationship balanced and in tact going forward.",soleil_lune7,False,1716180950.0

“Yes, strongly believing that you have memory problems can actually contribute to memory problems. This phenomenon is known as the ""nocebo effect"" or ""psychogenic interference.""

When you consistently think you have memory issues, it can:

1. Increase anxiety and stress, which can impair memory and cognitive function.
2. Lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy, where your negative beliefs influence your behavior and performance.
3. Cause you to doubt your abilities, leading to a lack of confidence and reduced effort, which can further impair memory.

This is not to say that actual memory problems don't exist or that your concerns are unfounded. However, it's essential to recognize the power of your beliefs and thoughts on your cognitive performance.”

1cw6p14,"This is something that I’m currently struggling with, so although I’m not a pro, hopefully I can provide some advice on what’s worked recently: 

- Be yourself! I often found that in the past, I’ve played up parts of my personality to appeal to certain people. This has not led to me feeling very connected with them even though there was a superficial connection. By being transparent about my interests and opinions, I know when people show interest in connecting with me, it’s for the right reasons.

-Find ways to make social interactions less intimidating. I think it’s natural to not feel like you’re not always the life of the party or able to engage everyone. So instead of thinking you need to act a certain way, just thank yourself for participating in the gathering. I find this is helpful for making new friends too. I’m not going to meet my best friend for life at an event, but just by putting myself in a space where I’m trying to meet more people, that is an achievement in itself. Exercise classes, workshops, and other events where the goal isn’t to make friends but are social in nature have made social interactions less intimidating for me.",Kind-Influence7222,False,1716178915.0

Life is a personal journey.  We tend to couple ourselves to what we think society sees as the ideal person.  I recommend getting away from social media platforms that people use to prop themselves up by their ""accomplishments.""  The comparing of ourselves to others is a train to nowhere.

My experience with life has always been an existential one.  I even found myself contemplating the nature of my existence when I was just a child.  This meant that I was probably going to spend most of my time not necessarily accomplishing things in the normal sense of the word.  However, I did spend time in college after high school and landed in the software industry.  

I spent the later half of my 20s mentally distraught.  There was nothing I could do that I would approve of.  I was the worst human being to ever exist.  I mean, look at all my peers.  A large majority of them have families, and I squandered my opportunities due to the soiling of the qualities that honestly made my brain so interesting to have.  (Weird way to put that lol)

So, in summary, I would say that 30 has been good to me.  I've accepted a lot of the things I thought were bad qualities of mine due to my distortions of reality.  I've started exploring other aspects of life (apirituality, for example) and have been trying to connect to people.

I've had concrete goals in my 20s, and I feel like I built up enough of a foundation, even with my mental health being practically terminal to my perception, that I can start pursuing intellectual, spiritual, and interpersonal goals.  Those are often unquantifiable, though, which used to trouble me quite a bit.

1cw4pie,"My personal past experiences have been that women automatically default to thinking guys are creepy or weird without even one word being said to them. It’s happened to me several times and I didn’t appreciate it. I’m probably one of the most respectful people anyone would ever meet. I go out of my way to make people not feel uncomfortable. Yet I go out and do things and if I make eye contact from across the room I’m labeled creepy or weird. 

How is that possible when someone knows nothing about the other person? It’s not like I’m staring into her soul or something. Simple glances at someone you find attractive seem completely normal to me. Or am I creepy for thinking that? 

On two occasions I tried saving runaway shopping carts for women who were putting their groceries in the back of their SUV’s in broad daylight mind you. They thought I was trying to steal their shopping carts and pepper sprayed me. Both of them. On different occasions! Rather than ask what I was doing or thank me from letting their cart plow into the car parked next to them, I get fucking pepper sprayed! Why? They stigmatized me by thinking I was out to rob them and or steal their shit. I get it that I’m a big guy (6’2” 215), but I wouldn’t harm a fly. I was being a Good Samaritan and trying to prevent someone car from getting dented by a shopping cart. But because guys have the stigma of rape and kidnapping, I got fucking pepper sprayed! 

I couldn’t tell you how many times standing in line somewhere I will just say hi to a woman and her response isn’t even hi back. It’s “I have a boyfriend thank you”. It’s like I wasn’t even asking if you did. I wasn’t hitting on you. I simply said hi. I could have said “beautiful day today isn’t it?” And I would have gotten the same response because they all assume we’re hitting on them. 

These things are small examples of many that have occurred. After enough times of shit going down and pepper spray twice, I just said fuck this and stopped trying. It’s sad because I’m a genuinely good human. I’m out to be good and do the right thing as often as possible. I try to help people when I can. I have a good job. I’m a homeowner. I have my shit together. But because men have these stigmas of being rapists and murderers and kidnappers and pervs and thieves, we’re all labeled that way, even the good ones. Because of this, I just gave in. I’m done. It’s not worth the shitty treatment for something I personally never did. If they’re all that quick on the trigger, I want nothing to do with them anyway. And if I’m being completely open and honest here, this happens FAR more often than it doesn’t! I’d say I’ve heard the “I have a boyfriend” line more times than I have gotten a simple “hi” in the response to me saying hi to them. It’s sad. Pathetic really. If women think that poorly of men, I want no part of a woman in my life. And I’ve stuck to my guns about that too. 15 years single now. Honestly, it’s pretty damn good. I’d love to have a good woman in my life. But apparently they all have boyfriends. Just say hi, they’ll make sure to let you know.

Now that that’s out of the way, it would be a stigma if I didn’t have personal data to back up my claims. I’ve had 16 girlfriends in my life. 4 of them long term. One I was engaged to.

1cw4pie,"Damn. That made me so sad to read. As a woman, I am sensitive to the fact that I can be overpowered by most men, because I’m not very big, or strong. However, I do not look at all men as potential predators. If a man says “hi” to me in the grocery store or does something nice for me, I do not automatically assume that they are trying to sleep with me. I give people the benefit of the doubt until I start feeling uncomfortable, but I am still polite about it. For example, I clean hotel rooms, and one of the former maintenance men used to come do maintenance stuff in the bathroom when I was cleaning it. I finally told him that I would wait until he was finished to come in the bathroom to clean because I felt uncomfortable being in there with him, let alone anyone, because the bathrooms are tiny. I didn’t call him names or say that I thought he was creepy, I just simply told him I felt uncomfortable.

1cw4pie,"I didn’t mean to make you sad. I apologize for that. I’m not trying to invalidate anyone’s feelings either. If you feel threatened, by all means, pepper spray to hearts content.  What bothers me are the quick triggers and quick judgements. And I understand threatening situations are different and you have to act quickly. But honestly, I’m was just trying to stop runaway shopping carts. I’m not dressed like a hoodlum. I didn’t take the cart and run away. I literally grabbed it before it hit the car next to her and got a face full of mace (great band name if anyone wants to use it) lol. 

I totally understand uncomfortable situations like you explained. That’s awkward by anyone’s standards. And you did the right thing. Honestly I think you saved both of you any trouble. Not that you would, but you COULD say anything to anyone about what went down in that bathroom. And who is everyone gonna believe? See what I mean about stigmas? You prevented him from facing undue accusations and you protected yourself from being put into that situation. Good on you. Best case scenario all around. And please don’t think I’m saying you’d accuse anyone. I’m just using that as an example. You did the right thing. 

I’m also happy to hear you give people the benefit of the doubt. It’s admirable as hell. I used to do the same until people wore out their welcome with me. I could  tolerate hearing another “I already have a boyfriend” when I never even asked. Guys aren’t any better. They’re immature jerks for the most part. And both genders are equally inconsiderate. There is no common courtesy anymore. So, considering I’m the one bothered by all of this and I’m responsible for my feelings, I removed myself as part of the problem. I just stay home as much as possible now. It’s great. Food delivered. Movies on demand. Groceries dropped off at my door step. Amazon and door dash are my enablers lol. And guess what? No mace! No tasers. No assholes. No looking for parking. No car theft or shopping carts plowing into my truck. It’s sad that it has come to this but that’s how it goes. And I understand most people aren’t malicious. I get that completely. It’s just that absent mindedness, lack of courtesy, and genuinely rude people are becoming more and more commonplace these days. I choose to not deal with it. 

I hope you understand I’m not trying to label anyone as anything here. My opinions are generalizations based on my own experiences and I’ve gotten a lot of feedback from users here saying they have had similar experiences. So it isn’t just me. I’m sure there are equally as many who don’t experience what I have. I wish I was one of them. I just want people to understand that there are stigmas against men and then some women are quick to run to their friends or social media and complain that there are no good men out there.

Plus you have the added benefit of getting a veteran discount for the rest of your life and any other VA benefits.

Definitely not something everyone can pursue but it's more achievable than people think. Just set your mind to that goal and never quit. Plus you can get all kinds of jobs through the Air Force and army, and if you're smart you can even get an accredited certification for your military occupational specialty that translates into whatever career field you choose to pursue. The military isn't just infantry and combat arms anymore, at least give it a thought if you've got no other opportunities.

Last thing that might sell you on this is that you get paid vacations, guaranteed promotions and pay raises, guaranteed opportunity leave (paid time off).

I'm 30. I had my first drink at 21.

Everything. In. Moderation.

Dont use it as a crutch for depression. You can use it to relax after a rough day, but dont look at the bottle and say, ""i need to black out and forget everything"" because then it becomes a crutch, then you form a dependence 

I hate to be drunk. I like a good relaxing buzz, sometimes a little more in between. I keep water in me so that i am hydrated and dont feel like shit. Someone will probably call bullshit but I've only been hungover like 3-4 times max. Those times, I either forgot the water or had a drink with too damn much sugar.

Limit yourself. If i have tall boys, i limit myself to one. If i feel froggy and want two, i'll be sure to have a good meal before i drink so it doesn't hit me as hard.
If I have liquor. The meal is mandatory before i start. I usually mix my drinks with either tea or coke. Fill a glass about 25% with the liquor and the rest with whatever, so it's not as strong and tastes good.

I'll have ""binges"" where i might have a drink a night for, say, 3 or 4 days, then i won't even touch it for a weeks to a month and a half.

1cw2x1q,"Ex frat boy chiming in… I’ll tell you some of the best nights of my life were spent absolutely hammered, with my best buddies, singing along to songs we loved at big parties or just in somebody’s backyard around a bonfire.

That being said some of the worst nights of my life also occurred blackout drunk. Bad decision making. Anger, sadness, saying and doing things I’d later regret. Nearly killing myself because I was drunk enough and depressed enough not to care what was going on. Dark times.

Point is, life is all that yin and yang. Those were choices I made for myself, never got pressured into doing it, never pressured anyone else into doing it either.  Drinking doesn’t have to be as extreme as the 2 sides I just described, but it CAN be. And it can be without you intending for it to be either. I’ll tell ya it’s real easy to get carried away in a single night, 1 drink leads to another then another then you wake up in a hospital bed after having your stomach pumped.

It’s also easy to find yourself years into the habit, thinking about how many nights you wasted getting drunk, not remembering much, being hungover for a day or two after. Really tough to get ahead in life when 2-3 days of the week revolve around either getting drunk or recovering from it.

But like I started this off with, I wouldn’t trade some of those nights for anything. And I don’t think I would’ve had the same experience if I hadn’t been absolutely toasted right along side my best buddies. Those nights, as blurry as they might be, are some of the best memories I’ll cherish forever. 

But you certainly don’t need to drink in order to have a good time. And you definitely shouldn’t let anybody pressure you into doing it. If you ever want to try it, just take a baby step and see how you feel. Maybe avoid hard alcohol and stick to beer or wine.

Its too easy to want to take advantage of the memory lapses and loss of inhibitions that alcohol can cause; make sure any experiences drinking are as a complement to an already positive situation that you want to remember.

Look at your family and your own personality for hints as to how big of a threat alcohol would pose for you- are there issues with other addictions? Is it difficult to stop once something is started, regardless of how you're feeling about it while doing it?

IMHO I think trying isn't the end of the world. Start with a glass of beer. Something small and see how it impacts you.

If you want to try it and allow yourself to drink occasionally I would recommend setting a very strict boundary with yourself, like no more than two drinks in one night and a full glass of water in between them, and only drink once or twice a month on special occasions. 

That being said, you know yourself and if you feel it isn’t safe, it would be best not to start at all. I know fomo sucks but you can feel good knowing you’re making the right decision for yourself.

I’ve had one sip of beer in my life just to see what the taste was like. Didn’t like it and never had any desire to try anything else. I have a lot of alcoholism in my family tree and I’ve seen the effects. It didn’t seem worth the risk for something that I didn’t think I’d enjoy anyway.

It started after highschool school typical peer pressure, the college life with drinks everyday with or without exams, still had a 3.5 gpa and got a bachelor's in business.  Started to settle. Got married with step kids, great husband, etc.  I was an albatross that literally sucked the joy out of my life.  It started slow and I never got out of the drinks after work and on weekends, then after some major marital revelations, it became my best friend!  I would plan my day around the amount of vodka I stashed.  BTW vodka does smet, people say it don't, but know it does!  I starting hiding my private drinking of a 750ml of vodka everyday for like 10 years!!  That's how evil Satan and his demons roll.  I lost my job, my savings, the love of my life divorced me and that's when I hit rock grave dirt bottom.  I was committed for 3 weeks, then sent to rehab for 7 months.  Long story and a lot of waste.  I know it's not all my fault, but your the one in control of that beautiful temple of a body God has created -YOUR SOUL!

I have a roommate for expenses.  I used to drive an audi...I was living in a gated community as a stay at home stepmom...All my education seems lost at times.

1cw2x1q,"It's great that you're reaching out for support and being mindful of your mental health. Deciding whether or not to drink alcohol, especially if you have concerns about how it might affect you, is a significant decision. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Awareness and Caution**: Your awareness of the potential risks associated with alcohol use is a crucial first step. Many people don't consider these factors until after they've had negative experiences, so you're already ahead by thinking about this now.
2. **Mental Health**: Since you mentioned having mental health issues, it's wise to be cautious. Alcohol can sometimes exacerbate symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions. It can also interfere with medications you might be taking.
3. **Moderation and Control**: If you do decide to try drinking, starting slowly and setting strict limits for yourself can help you stay in control. For example, you might decide to have only one drink and see how you feel.
4. **Support System**: Surrounding yourself with supportive friends who respect your boundaries can make a big difference. If you choose to drink, having friends who understand your concerns and who won't pressure you to drink more than you're comfortable with is essential.
5. **Alternatives**: There are plenty of non-alcoholic beverages that can be just as enjoyable in social settings. Experimenting with these can be a fun way to participate without any of the associated risks.
6. **Professional Advice**: Consulting a mental health professional about your concerns can provide personalized advice and support tailored to your specific situation. They can help you weigh the pros and cons based on your mental health history and current condition.

Your decision to wait until you're in a better headspace is both responsible and commendable. Taking care of your mental health should always be a priority, and there's no rush to start drinking.

You may have friends who drink responsibly (or not) and not have these issues, and this may come off as missing out. Be in reality, alcohol sucks. Here are some things I will say, some advice mixed in.

1. Alcohol doesn’t even taste good, it burns your mouth and even being drunk isn’t fun. Not feeling like you’re in control (atleast to me) is a very panic inducing experience. You are not missing out on anything other than a potential vise that can lead a massive health complications.

2. If you decide to drink, you are an adult. Remind yourself to drink responsibly. As much as anyone can try and say “best to avoid”, you are going to do what you want. So if you do not take the advice of avoidance. Then take this advice “Moderation”.

3. Become familiar with the risks associated with alcohol, I am a volunteer fireman in a major city, iv seen what alcoholism can do to people in both health and social.

The anonymity of it all is perfect for allowing the sad and negative feelings - the good/positive ones are usually reserved for people in real life. That's just how it is.

1cvxhdb,"Have you paid the bill yet? If not delay it a week and pay for the therapy session, that takes priority imo. I learned a long time ago to not let bills get an emotional reaction out of me, I pay them when I pay them, the amount I can afford and that’s that. It’s transactional. I take care of me first, my health, my food, the roof over my head, my child’s needs etc all come first. 

As for being verbally shat on by a patron I’m so sorry. I never understand entitled people who think service workers are there for them to simply word vomit on or verbally abuse as they see fit. I go out of my way to acknowledge the human being standing in front of me doing the job, bc I’ve been in the service industry too. It’s freaking hard to smile for pennies on the dollar and pretend you love fixing everyone’s ridiculous issues. 
OP, tomorrow will come soon enough, and then before long it will be Friday and it will be ok. 

My only advice is there isn’t anything that alcohol won’t make worse, so as tempting as it is, getting blotto now won’t fix a thing and will only bring more issues to the week (less money, more hangover, anxiety etc).",Left-Nothing-3519,False,1716151427.0
1cvxhdb,"That's the thing. They will go after you if you don't pay it, even drag you to court. I've already paid for it. I'm gonna see if I can pay on Friday instead. If not, then I'll use my credit card again.... I'm pretty much living off of it at this point",Collector_2012,True,1716160348.0
1cvxhdb,"My experience with credit cards and billing is I tell them I’m getting paid … date and will send payment then. As long as it’s within 30-ish days of payment due date they can’t do anything. They try to put pressure when you are unsure or show insecurity. As for them sending a statement 2 months late, I will pay it within 30 days of receipt. I treat all billing the way any business treats billing / remove the emotions from the equation. It makes it much less stressful. Companies count on people being emotional about this stuff, I’ve been through bankruptcy, I’ve been widowed, I’ve started over with nothing to my name and needing to support a family with no help and no family around to help. 
I promise you that you can do this. Take a breath, take a seat, and take a step back from the emotional reactivity. It’s a numbers game. 
The bills come in, I arrange them by due date and by importance. I give them 30 days to sit and marinate while I take care of daily life. Things like food, health and well-being, shelter come first. The threats of debt collections is noise, they have to follow the same process everyone else does, its 90 days, plus notice after notice, they like to rattle cages and be verbally aggressive but the fact is they can’t force you to do anything if they have only sent you one bill and haven’t given you any other notice. Thats their mistake. You treat the bill that same as any other that has just come through the mail. 
Companies can say lots of things, it’s up to you how you choose to react to them. Just giving you my 30+ years of experience as an average working person who does not let creditors scare me into freaking out. Life’s too short for that.",Left-Nothing-3519,False,1716161552.0

I think it is also a chemistry thing, something almost flips in your brain and the journey starts. By no means are you going to be waking up one day feeling like you're 'cured', but you will feel it. You don't have to graduate, if school is making your so unhappy, drop out. People who drop out can also be successful, however, that is something that is up to you. People who tend to get help when they are rock bottom low, will have to spend more time trying to get better vs the people who caught onto it sooner. Some people can struggle silently through out their teen years and into their early adult life. They only then reach out when they have hit the bottom of the bottoms, so then their healing journey starts from there.

Even if I was normal, there was no way I would have felt normal in these hick schools.

In 10th grade, I attended a different high school in Virginia what wasn't so hick. It was a much larger school. I did my best to fit it. I played sports, so I made some friends that way. There are very few genuine personalities in high school. Everyone just fakes it. But there were a few kids that just didn't give a F. I look back now, and man, I really envy them - to have the maturity at that age to just be who the F they want, and not faking it for anyone else. They weren't trouble makers. They weren't jocks.

She can't remember much as it is, and I know she will never functionally be able to help me cope with my childhood stolen away by neglect. Sometimes, I'm afraid, for her sake, that she *does* remember, and is withering away with the fleeting memories--but other times, I'm angry, like you, and I want to scream into the void that her memory loss is such a cheap way to escape facing the results of her past choices.

1cvt9ab,"This is definitely sexual assault because you didn't consent. There is no justification for forcing yourself onto someone else or touching someone without their consent, regardless of whether or not you're intoxicated, lonely, repressed, or the person is a friend.

The following is provided to hopefully give you some insight on what may be going on with your friend. It's not an excuse or justification, nor is it guaranteed to be correct.

Your friend might be really struggling with or questioning his sexuality. Given your description of the community you're in, he may feel like hate himself, everyone would hate him if they knew, he'd lose everyone and everything, he has to smother/kill that part of himself, he's broken/like something's wrong with him, and/or he has to put on a mask and go out of his way to make people think he's straight. 

Feeling that way for so long without support can cause serious depression, anxiety, fear, and other chronic mental health issues. He may have done this to you because, in a drunken state, he felt safe with you and was inhibited enough to drop his facade and make a move.

I want to be 100% crystal clear that this is not an excuse, his behavior is entirely unacceptable, and should be addressed with him. You would be absolutely within your right to go to the police and press charges or end the friendship, if you wanted.

If you want to preserve the friendship and support him, I'd suggest pulling him aside in a private space and having an even-toned discussion with him. Something like:

""Hey man. We need to talk about what happened. First, I want you to know that you're my bro and nothing is going to change that. You can tell me anything, trust me, and know that I want you to be comfortable enough with me to be yourself around me. 

That being said, what happened last night was not ok. I know you were drunk and in your feelings, but it's not ok to touch people without their permission or make them do things they don't want to do. You put me in a really awkward position because you clearly were going through some things and needed some support and I wanted to help you, but you were assaulting me at the same time. I really need you to not do that again.

This isn't because I think you're gay, bi, or anything else. I wouldn't care in the slightest if you were and would be there for you and support you if you were. This is because what happened wasn't right and I want to be able to preserve this friendship.

If you want to talk about this or anything else that's been going on with you, I'm here, man.""",SandSurfSubpoena,False,1716140492.0

Thanks",Vladiklev,True,1716143572.0
1cvt2ua,"I'll be very direct, to save time: think about the situation or context in which you feel afraid, remembering it. Then, keeping this scene superficially on the mental screen, keep your eyes closed and say mentally, referring to yourself, **using emotion in your mental voice and concentrating hard** on each word:

""'Harry"" \[*your own name here*\], **wanting to face this situation** will bring you a lot of courage, a lot of peace, wanting to face this situation will bring you a lot of happiness of victory, it will bring you a lot of personal evolution, it will make you a great person, it will make you feel stronger and more capable, it will bring well-being and help you to be successful, it will make your life more complete, etc. (add as many positive things as you want to strengthen this positive process about facing).""

Then say: ""Harry"" \[*your name*\], **wishing to escape this situation** will bring you distress and disgrace, make you feel very bad and live a horrible life, wishing to escape will destroy your happiness, destroy your peace, etc. ( add as many negative things as you can think of to strengthen the negative idea about running away).

You need to speak as if you were your friend. Without concentration and without emotion it doesn't work. The emotion can be tender, maybe a little harsh, depending on how you want to express your feeling in words. When it's horrible things, use a sadder, bad mental tone.",-ZaneTruesdale-,False,1716140882.0

Sometimes Asian people *are* good at math, students in universities often find foreign exchange students from Asia, often in order to get accepted into a university in america the Asians that do come are highly skilled in multiple areas, and so, the stereotype gets perpetuated. 

Women often do have bad experiences with men. 2 out of three women ages 16-36 reported experiencing at least one form of harassment over their previous year, the statistics (and there’s a lot more of them) kinda make it super understandable why women feel uncomfortable with men. 

Sure, not all men are bad, and women are smart and don’t belong in the kitchen, and black people aren’t vile. But sometimes things occur that reinforce the narrative either accidentally or by unfortunate coincidence. 

Honestly with the stats the way they are, I am shocked women don’t feel even less safe and comfortable around men, but many still want to find a good relationship where they feel safe and cared for. Same for men, and it’s unfortunate, but your feelings of safety and security don’t conform to logic, they are emotions, and emotions for all people are wild and fairly difficult to wrangle, even more-so if you have first-hand trauma and ptsd.

I hope women and men can both heal and grow, have abundant social lives and find community and acceptance and support.

1cvphk6,"I do see your point. It would be better if the question was phrased that way, but the point of it is for the question to be polarizing, not to be politically correct or sensitive to men’s issues.

I can tell this question is harming your emotional well-being and sense of honor and dignity as a man. It’s unfortunate, and it’s unfair, but life isn’t meant to be fortunate and fair. It’s uneven and respect and quality of life, and happiness is inequitably distributed. You are fighting a battle against someone who feels equally or more wronged than yourself likely at the hands of one or many men. And the reason it gained traction is because it’s an emotional outlet for women to converge socially on.

Still, most women choose to seek out romantic and platonic relationships with men. But emotions aren’t logical, and frustration gets worse as it becomes more pent-up.

I’ve personally ditched social media and have been flying solo now except for irl relationships. I am happy, I never see any polarizing and hurt and agressive issues that I hold zero personal responsibility over. It’s liberating, and pretty peaceful. If you are a good man, you should take pride and restfulness in that knowledge, and if these things still bother you, then it’s best to have conversations with people who seek you out to specifically vocalize the emotional content that they feel you would be most reliable, and supportive, and beneficial to approach you with.

People can’t be perfect, you, me, sally who started this trend, etc. we all have our strengths and weaknesses and (*in my opinion*) we should aim to live our lives helping the best way we can. And sometimes that’s by getting ourselves out of the way so people can vent and relieve themselves of the pent up fear and anger and sadness and pain so they stop carrying it with them everywhere they go. While it might not be healthy for men, it’s also something that is healthy for them to release so they can feel better in their day-to-day lives. 🤷‍♂️ I say let it go and try finding greater happiness and peace.

If under your logic people should live in fear then should we treat black people diffrently just because they commit more crime then others? Or should arabs be treated  as terorists until proven othewise?

I get your point and SA it is worse then death. R\*pists should have  life sentence in prison but living in fear in general isnt living.

My point is to not be scared of men unless its some weird situation even woman can be scary in some situations.

And to your point about gold digging it is true but there are more gold diggers woman than men. Same as there are mor men r\*pists so everyone should look out for that too right?",Healthy_Quiet77,True,1716211469.0

Some suggestions of new things to try/ learn about could be 

-Learn new ways to cook that seem more difficult than your used to
-Learn an outdoor skill like fishing, shooting, archery or foraging
-Learn to skateboard, rollerskate, rollerblade or even hoverboard 
-Learn how to whittle (seriously, one of the easiest hobbies to get into and very rewarding) 
-Try more fun ways of working out like sports or dance 
-Teach yourself how to play an instrument 
-Try your hand at coding

1cvl7au,"I think you where emotionally abused, I suspect by a parent (or caregiver). You stop trusting your intuition. It's NOT your fault your like this. In fact I'm certain that your childhood did this. It always leads back to childhood. I am reminded of my old self when I read your comments, it feels very familiar.

The book I recommended earlier, will help alot. It's very big but just read what speaks to you. It doesn't have to be read front to back. It'll provide so much fundamental insight.

I think you haven't fully explored your past due to how painful it is. I did ketamine for a bit and did some digging into my past, it really helps. Unfortunately you may abuse it like I did, but once the initial sting of realisation passes you'll want to control the use of substance. You'll care for yourself more. You think you've uncovered everything but memories come back and bite, trust me if your feeling this way there's more to find.

You are out of tune with intuition. It's how toxic parents and  get ya. As long as your out of touch you'll always come back, you'll always be under their thumb. Malevolent people sense this and now you have a whole new beast that your friends with and you have no idea about their dark intentions. You can escape this cycle, but it's an ongoing process. It gets easier the further you get. Your mind will provide the tools you need once you reconnect with your past (understand it deeply).

Finding a spiritual belief system is super helpful in orienting yourself in life. I personally use a mix of Christianity and Hermeticism. Right now you may not believe in that stuff, but we have worshipped as humans for millions of years so it's in our DNA and is sure to make you feel better.

And as much as I'd like to claim that I'm above such things, it's simply in our nature and none of us really are.

That said, it's not the fears themselves that should be treated as the issue, rather it should be how you react to them. It's understandable that you don't want to get hurt, but if you're always protecting yourself from pain, you leave no time to feel joy and all you'll ever feel is pain.

I think that you should try to come to terms with the fact that anyone might do you wrong at any moment and that you, regardless of what happens, are going to be all right.

The last part of that is what's important: you're going to be all right. You are allowed to not dwell on these things.

1cvitv7,"Being 14 is a really weird age in life. It sucks and every aspect of your life feels like it sucks. First off as a recovering self harm addict whose been doing it since I was 14 and whose now 20. Stop. You will live past the age you are now and will regret the things you’ve done to yourself. Self mutating does nothing but make things worse with ur family, friends, school etc. . Being lgbt as a minor also sucks but honestly you don’t have to date right now I know it feels nice to have someone but I promise you having a boyfriend isn’t going to fix all ur problems if anything depending on whose your boyfriend at 14 it might just make your life worse. Any relationship I’ve had or anyone else I’ve known at 14 was always ridiculously toxic. And for your parents they will come around you just have to give it time and if not FUCK THEM your parents do not determine what the kind of person you want to be. You might not be able to do what you want right now but you WILL. Life isn’t all sunshine and rainbows when you’re an adult but you’re able to make conscious decisions for yourself and honestly that’s the best part of adulthood. 
My advice to you is to pick up a hobby and stop trying to find a lover. You’re so young and still trying to figure it out. Spend time with yourself, love yourself, get to know you. So when you finally meet someone you actually enjoy you can be in a healthy relationship with a healthy mindset.  Suicide doesn’t fix your problems it’s you running away from them.

1cvhjdy,"Yes, sensory issues are related to ADHD and anxiety. Generally ADHD has connections to people having anxiety and depression. What you are talking about with the vacuum sound, and going out in public space and loud noises is what is called ""sensory overload"". People who neurodivergent have a harder time filtering their senses. We have 5 main types of sensory: touch, taste, smell, sound, visual and taste. For ""normal"" people, they are able to filter out the background distractions. For example, the sound of buzzing, or people talking in the background, whispering etc. However, for people who are neurodivergent, they have over or under sensitivity. That means that people could need more touch (like fidgets) to remain calm and 'organise' their brain. However, for you, it sounds like you're hyperaware of sounds and visual things. Which is completely normal part of having anxiety and other diagnoses. Different people have different triggers. For some, they don't mind loud sounds, but they can't have too crunchy of food. However, some other people can't stand loud noises and they love crunchy food but not mushy food. Everyones brains are hardwired differently. 

For you, it seems to be visual and auditory sensitivity. Often being in places for too long with those triggers end up having emotional breakdowns, and sensory overload and need time aware in a place away from their triggers. It can also mean that people who spend all day in that kind of enviroment come home and feel like they are just so tired from being out. Often people are also masking while they are out which means they also become more tired. This is called burn out (I can make another comment about that with more information about that if you need)

I am also sensitive to loud noises and just overall a lot happening around me. Some things that I have found helpful (again, this varies for people) I wear noise cancelling headphones when I go out and sometimes even just in my house. I use the Bose QC45 and AirPod pros, they both play music (which I find very relaxing for my anxiety) and have amazing noise cancelation. If you want to block out everyone and everything, playing music will do that. However, if you are wanting to go out with someone and still be able to hear them, and not just everything else, then not having music but the noise cancellation on can be enough for that. There are also Loop Ear buds that are really popular, they are a lot more discrete than wearing headphones and you can get them in different 'levels' of noise cancelation. Blocking out all that extra noise means that you can be out in the world for longer periods of time. It also helps with the visual overload because you aren't darting your eyes around to every sound that you hear. Other ways would be learning breathing techniques (I know, very cringy as everyone says that) but it can be really helpful. Bringing fidgets along to can keep your hands busy (I tend to pick my skin a lot when I'm anxious). 

When you come back from being out, you feel super tired from all the sensory input you have got. I have a weighted blanket, and I LOVE it. It helps me sleep longer and fall asleep faster (a major issue I had) it is also really helpful for when I come home from long busy days out and just want to calm down.

I hope this helps you!",GuppyTheGalactic,False,1716099999.0

1cvd932,"Talking to your family is rough, but it's one step forward into getting help. 

It sounds like you have had a lot of things happening in your life I can definitely see how this could be affecting you. I'm not sure how you got diagnosed with ADHD, whether it was through a doctor or a psychiatrist or something else. However, I think that the way that you got diagnosed with ADHD could be a good start into reaching out for help. You can tell your parents that you don't feel well and need to go see a doctor. You can make up whatever excuse, you can then ask to talk to the doctor yourself and discuss your concerns. 

This next suggestion is something some people have found helpful and sometimes not. This would be talking to the school counsellor (or a teacher / staff member that you trust). You can talk to them about your eating habits and other issues you've been having. However, they may have to break confidentiality about your eating if it's getting to an unhealthy point. You could also talk to the school counsellor / staff members about not knowing how to tell your parents that you need help, they can help with that. You can make a plan together as to what to say, and your school counsellor can help give them resources or a referral to a adolescent mental health team. 

Generally the referral would lead to CAMHS (child adolescent mental health service) some have found helpful, some not, it just depends. I personally have gone through the system (however it varies on place to place) and it has been really helpful. They have dieticians, people who specialise in ED's and etc. This is also a good way to get your parents into the loop, I know it sound scary but your parents are an important role into improving your mental health. It is defiantly rough for a little bit, but it gets better. The therapists can meet with your parents to give them advice on how to help you and such. Like you said in your post, therapists don't always gel with their clients. You are always able to say that you aren't a good fit with your therapist and that you would like another one. It is your right to do that, I know it sounds scary, but it won't be their first time that a client hasn't gelled with them. 

With regards to missing school, I feel you. I have missed so much school due to my mental health. I now am doing part time schooling and slowly but surely spending more time at school. This is something that all schools are able to provide (however, I know it can be quite the push to get them to listen) but it has been really helpful for me. It gets rid of the stress of having to be at school when you don't feel like you can mentally do it. You take less class's, less time at school, and other accomodations for your mental health can be added. 

I hope this helps! You are welcome to dm me to talk or what more information. I have been in the similar situation as you and I understand what you are going through. You can do it, and I believe in you. Best of luck xx",GuppyTheGalactic,False,1716099141.0

1cvd932,"It sounds like you had to take all the normal class's and then just had times where you didn't need to be at school. For me, I just took 3 class's instead of the normal 6 class's. So whenever I had those 3 class's, I was at school. When I didn't have class's allocated during that period, I wasn't at school. This was I didn't have a full caseload of class's and only had to focus on a specfic amount of class's. So then I wasn't missing time in other class's too. It also gave me the opportunity to have a flexible schedule as to when I wanted to do some work at home, or if I just wanted to come home and chill.",GuppyTheGalactic,False,1716148541.0
1cvh1i9,"If you think she is a danger to herself or others (this includes her kids and family members) then you can call the police for a welfare check and explain that. If you do know her therapist, you can also send them an email / request to meet with them to discuss your sister (this depends on the therapist and things like that). I understand that she might put up a mask with her therapist as it's really common. Is this a new therapist? Generally people who mask infront of their therapist, they may not 100% trust their therapist, and feel uncomfy. However, I do understand that trust takes time, and this could be another factor of her putting up her barrier. 

I think that the best way to go though this is either sit down as a family, and discuss your concerns with her. Otherwise, like I said above. you (or your family) can meet with her therapist and discuss your concerns around her bipolar. However, therapists aren't able to diagnose bipolar disorder, only psychiatrists can. However, the therapist maybe able to send a referral to someone who can diagnose her and give her opinion on what she thinks. Or you can mix the two together and meet with your sister, therapist and you (or/and your family) together to discuss the concerns. Kind of life family therapy.

1cvfy4x,"If you are at risk to yourself or others, please do reach out to your emergency number or a helpline of some sort. 

I would suggest trying to talk to a therapist about it, and a psychiatrist can help with medication. Another way to go about this would be admitting yourself to the hospital and explain what is happening. You would be able to get medicated, get diagnosis and help. However, I am aware that some ED's will throw you out and call you attention seeking (trust me, you aren't and no one is attention seeking). Some psych wards aren't great, however they are some good ones. I have been to good and bad ones. But I think that either way, you are still going to get help.

My advice: Don't go looking for a definition of what wrong with you. Do some self reflecting instead, you're the only one that knows you truly. Think about the why's. Try to find the root cause of why you feel the way you do now, and work to improve it. Remind yourself that we all go through it, and you need to let go of baggage from time to time.

Something that I have found really helpful is typing / writing it out. Sometimes it's late at night and I have a lot on my mind, I'll type it on a locked note, and I just feel more calm. I have done the same thing with my therapist, I wrote out a 5 page note about all the things that I had been going through because I simply couldn't verbalise it. It was the only way I knew how to get help because I needed it, I  just wasn't able to voice how I felt. I also often will text my mum about what's going on. It's an unspoken rule we have. If I text her something, she texts back and won't confront me about me. A lot of people find writing / typing things out easier because they have time to think and process what they are going to say and they feel as though it's a lot less confronting (which I find). 

I think that you should try and write a letter, text or even email to your family / friends. You don't have to tell them everything, you can tell some people more then others, or even just a little bit of information is a step forward for you. It's really scary, you don't have to tell them everything at one go, just step by step. I have found writing stuff down so helpful to tell other people how I feel, and to just help myself cope with my thoughts and feelings.

1cvbjx9,"I understand that, I get go through the same thing. I can feel fine for a bit and then all of a sudden I'm back to being really low. Sometimes when we do too much during the periods where I feel okay, it lead to a lower burn out. For example. if we consider out energy as a battery, and on a good day you have 70% battery, you think to yourself (I feel fine today, I'm gonna do this, and this and this) and by the end of the day, you're at 5%. However, it takes longer to charge up your battery, vs using your battery. You then used do much of your battery over the course of a day or maybe a few days that it takes you a long time to recharge your battery. During that charging period, you don't have enough battery to do the everyday ""chores"" like getting up, brushing your teeth etc. However, not keeping good enough care of yourself, also then drains your battery, so you are stuck in a cycle where you're low on battery, don't want to get up and do anything because it all feels like a chore, but then not doing it makes your battery go lower (aka makes you feel worse) and then it cycles. 

Something that I have found helpful with dealing with it, is simply not doing too much during the better days. When you wake up and you feel like you're doing ""fine"" and having a ""better day"" think about what percentage you're at. Maybe you wake up at 50%, think about the things that make you feel good (shower, go for a walk etc) but also acknowledge and think to yourself, how much of doing xyz is going to take out of your battery. You only have so much percentage in a day, set yourself a limit. Maybe stop and have some down time when your batter gets to 30% and wait to ""recharge"" until you feel better. Even if that means you don't do anything else for the day, you still get something accomplished and you hopefully charge up your battery for the next day you have enough battery to do other things. 

Overall, don't over work youself to the point that your battery gets too low. I know sometimes new stressors come into our lives unexpectedly and that drains our battery more. That's okay, everyone has that and you aren't alone in it. However, knowing that the smallest tasks like taking a shower makes your battery charge up and makes you feel better, just try and do it on the harder days. Don't let your battery percentage get too low. I know it's hard, but even just getting up and taking a shower is a huge win for yourself.

1cv5m99,"sounds like you’re going through a really tough and complicated situation. Navigating such deeply rooted differences, especially around beliefs and family expectations, is incredibly challenging,it seems like you both genuinely care about each other, but the pressure from her family's expectations and your core beliefs being in conflict is understandably creating a lot of stress. It’s important to stay true to yourself and your beliefs, but it’s also clear how much you care about her well-being, but I feel like you see this relationship as a burden in your life, I just think you have to think for yourself too and not please her family members or her.
