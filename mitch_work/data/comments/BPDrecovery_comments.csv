1cvm23o,"I'm sorry you're going through that. There are people out there though. My partner has BPD and has really done a number on me to be honest, but Ive been researching the disorder since October 2022 and have really educated myself and don't plan on stopping  At this point u understand her better than she does. But she is still untreated and won't have access to treatment for a little bit because she's in prison. In and out for 23 years with an addiction for that time. It's sad when the horrific statistics are 65-90% of substance abusers have an underlying personality disorder. If you want to talk I'm willing. I've found with her it does help if the person she is speaking to isn't me. The emotional attachment, shame guilt and remorse for the past three years just causes her to lash out and then I get hurt again. Maybe talking to a partner without the emotional attachment might help you too.",Full-Pineapple3052,False,1716134067.0

1cvm23o,"I never thought abt talking to another partner. 

How does it work if she doesn't speak TO you? How does she contact you?

I find writing or emailing/typing works with me. It's hard to convey what's in my head out verbally and with people (not just him, besides my therapist and psych) waiting for what I'm gonna say terrifies me, especially recently. I know a few ppl are waiting on me to say the wrong thing so they can point it out, then I correct them, they ask how, then arguing ensues... ""crazy bpd girl.""

I used to be the ""quiet"" type and just let my exhusband do whatever he wanted, never had any voice in anything that my family did, no voice with my friends, nothing. After divorce that changed. 
It may need to change back to being quiet without having opinions or thoughts.  Just keep harming myself.",erinc2005,True,1716135430.0
1cvm23o,"It's really difficult. She can call, write letters and has a tablet for email time messages. 

It's been about three years and she has been locked up longer than she's been out with me. I think this is the sixth time maybe? Plus five months in a rehab

A few months ago she said some vicious things in a message and actually said herself we should part ways. So I blocked the phone and messages

She still called. 2-5 times a day. About three weeks later there was a situation with the animals that I felt would be unfair to not tell her about. So I answered the phone and it was like she was a different person

The Next day I got a letter in the mail so it was already on its way. And she had gotten herself electronic stamps in case I reconnected

The significance is she would always wait for me to send the stamps and would spend any commissary money the same day on snacks and stuff

This time she got paper, envelope and physical stamps as well as electronic

So there was growth. And it held for a little bit but untreated means unchanged so I talked to my therapist and said I think I need to not focus on the growth itself but the reason for it.

Not to mention I was starting to do a little better but fell right back in after one call 

So I am currently in a no contact again but I won't abandon her. I am trying to figure out a way to get some help. I had an idea of a BPD pen pal system. Not for diagnosis or treatment but just new friends that truly get it and know how it feels",Full-Pineapple3052,False,1716136033.0

I ve seen lots of videos about BPD and nod, BPD and nod and of course my situation BPD with codependent which is referred to by one coach as the perfect storm. The FP information seems to say you guys eithipick someone good that you can't maintain because of the disorder and sabotage the relationship to drive them off. Or an emotionally unavailable person that you chase relentlessly until it becomes too much. Either way at the end of the day you brain is like see? I told they were gonna leave. Everyone leaves. There's. a bunch or reason why, like justifying that fear above, leaving them before they leave you, or just the impulsive in the moment need to be with them.

1cvm23o,"We've been together 6 years. He treats me like a princess typically. We BOTH have done things not to trust each other but I haven't gone to this length and it's disturbing me. I have nothing to hide (anymore), but him constantly digging on me feels like projecting. I've done it before so I can pick it out. I'd love to be wrong. 

We're both going thru a difficult time. His dad died in October and mine did last month. I'm doing his estate stuff and I can't start to ""heal"" without constantly looking at it. I know him seeing me down is bringing up emotions for him. 

I haven't been this ""good"" as far as bpd in a while overall. I haven't been in the hospital since Dec 2019 but I honestly should be in there now. They'll just change meds and mess me up. Always do. The impulsivity of this disorder is scary. I didn't plan my attempt. I just did it. When I was hospitalized, I planned it for a day or 2, so that was warranted. 

I just want things to be back normal.

1cu4adj,"Hi OP, been there before.

**To answer your question outright, you move on by being better to the next person.**

That bridge is burned. You can’t go back in time. Although you’re remorseful and you’re grieving what could have been, this is what was needed. 

You being self-reflective in that aspect and knowing when to cease communicating further is a sign of growth.

 **Use these skills for the next chapter of your life.**

As much as it sucks, BPD can do this to relationships. 

All we can do is accept responsibility for our part, apologize sincerely, and do our best to prevent or minimize this behavior from happening in the future.

I am learning DBT skills, but the one thing that is important to me is that I know I cannot heal in an environment where I'm constantly triggered.

1cu4adj,Instead of seeing it as a bad thing try to see it as you’re finally free and can do literally whatever you want without worrying whether or not people like you for your own decisions. I know personally with bpd comes depression and anxiety so no matter how hard it is surround yourself with new friends and date around.

I hope you also feel proud, even though it's hard to feel like you should have known sooner and acted differently. Like some people have said, the best thing to do is to take this with you moving forward and do things differently next time. 

And it's shitty of your ex to use his new gf to make you feel bad, he's probably hurt, not that it's an excuse. I think it's probably best for the both of you to move on, you don't have to live in the land of regrets and ""what ifs"", wondering if things could be different had you known what you know now. I feel bad about past relationship mistakes, but I try to think about how those mistakes made me realise I need to change for the better. You didn't know what you know now in the past, so don't beat yourself up. Remember to have compassion for yourself, and your past self who was in pain and dealt with that the only way you knew how to. The most important thing is that you know better now.

The way I moved on was to just keep going, reminding myself that I found something special with someone once and I can do so again. And more importantly, you're learning to feel good on your own, too. This time you're equipped with the knowledge to do things differently, and there's comfort in that. You can go into new relationships knowing that you don't have to rely on others to feel happy or calm yourself down, which makes it less scary feeling like you can lose them. And things can even be better than last time. That makes a world of difference, at least to me.

Now; it should be noted that many other difficulties occurred in my life since she left me- pandemic and the Shanghai lockdowns; trying to get help in a vastly different culture; and a changing landscape of my career. 

We did not end well; but as we are entangled to a degree in our work we’ve learned how to communicate. Otherwise she’s not interested even in friendship- which I respect. I believe exes being actual friends is an extreme rarity for pwBPD. 

For me the rumination is painful; and not having someone I trust to talk to makes it harder.   What helps is remembering the bad, counteracting the comfort I seek in nostalgia. She did not listen well, she exhibited behaviors associated with narcissism; she openly admitted to testing me to watch me fail; I never became the business leader she thought I should. It helps. 

About closure… I believe closure doesn’t exist; it’s a manufactured human concept based on one party’s wishes.

1csfqeq,"Interesting app/site! If you don't mind me asking, which country do you live in? 

If you have access to public health care, I would suggest looking for a formal diagnosis, then sign up for a DBT program. I live in BC, Canada, so I can be more specific if you're here, too, but otherwise, I'm not terribly familiar with how things might work.

In any event, you can always search Google & YouTube for DBT skills & tools. I downloaded a free ""DBT Tools"" app for my (android) phone. DBT is Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, which is a system of skills, tools, and different ways of thinking in hopes that we with BPD may lessen the distress we cause others and ourselves.

I think it's important to note that DBT has helped many people, but some folks express frustration with the program. For instance, DBT was created by Marsha Linehan, who is a white female academic with a Catholic, conservative, middle-class upbringing who grew up in the American mid-west around the middle of the 20th century. With this in mind, I think it's best to learn it all, then hold onto what works for you and leave the rest. 

Things I really like: deep breathing; mindfulness; STOP; the dime game (which I also have an app for); I have a positive sensation overload bag (something to positively overwhelm each sense - a playlist to go with this too); and TIP (especially the cold temp). 

Finally, I hope you don't have bpd. I hope you're able to access health care and that you get a far less stigmatized diagnosis. Many therapists won't work with us. Lots of people will write off those of us with BPD because of their experience with someone else with BPD even though we're not a monolith. Best of all, the fine line between BPD and CPTSD seems to rely on how the diagnostic professional you speak with considers your trauma. If you're also a person who menstruates, PMDD shares many symptoms with BPD...

Instead of dropping the big ol' ""I think I have BPD"" (which I personally think is better for a therapist you've already been seeing for awhile,) I would instead explain the average symptoms you experience on a daily basis AND explain how they impact you/the loved ones in your life.

Also, therapists are educated, trained, and then paid to listen, respect, and care for you. I highly doubt your average therapist is going to attack you, or anyone, for having BPD. Not because it doesn't happen, but because it's an easy, quick way to get fired and blacklisted from ever being a therapist again. Not a lot of people will risk their career over one client.

1cs5cmt,"There is a difference between therapists and psychologists and psychiatrists.

Therapist: provide regular talk therapy to help you through life. Many therapists have an area of specialty, or different skill sets. Some that are more apt for helping clients w BPD include; DBT, IFS, and trauma therapy. Vast majority of therapists can not and will not provide a diagnosis. Most therapists may not see the benefit in diagnosing with a medical label, because they are able to directly work with the issues you bring up in session (so for the therapist, the approach they take is informed by your experiences, NOT by a diagnosis. In my experience, the therapists I click best with are those who are almost explicitly disinterested in diagnostic labels, as such labels do not serve their job of helping you with life.)

Psychologist: Deep understanding of brain functions. Psychologists have a broader and deeper understanding of various disorders and abnormalities of mental health, and how it relates to what is happening in the brain. For example, knowing what are common triggers for bipolar episodes. They are licensed to determine if a patient meets criteria for mental health conditions in the DSM-5. I have only ever had one therapist who was also a psychologist, psychologists rarely see clients for regular talk therapy, but instead meet with clients maybe once a year, or when new symptoms arise.

Psychiatrist: basically the same as a psychologist, but is able to prescribe medication. Familiar with all the things needed to help clients make the best choices when medicating mental health conditions. 

In order to get a meeting with a psychologist or psychiatrist, talk to your family doctor. As others have mentioned, leading with descriptions of symptoms as opposed to ""I think I have BPD"" tends to go over better with doctors. When my doctor scheduled a meeting with a psychologist, it took him about 2 minutes to start assessing me for BPD. Which he did without outright telling me, but I could tell where the line of questions was heading. I answered honestly, and received a diagnosis.

Finding a good fit therapist is much more important to changing your life. A diagnosis does nothing but provide a medical label for your problems, a therapist will help you learn how to actually address those problems and change your life for the better.

I never brought it up but when going to a therapist when I was like 19 or 20 my therapist asked me “have you ever heard of borderline personality disorder?” I mentioned that I suspected but never really got a diagnosis until then. It was relieving to be diagnosed and it was very validating when it was brought up to me. Though bringing up, “hey, I feel like I might have these symptoms of BPD, X, Y, and Z. Could we explore those and see what we can do to move forward?” Could really help. It’s like saying you suspect you have BPD but you aren’t sure and you want to know what could be causing these debilitating symptoms. I will say, I had a therapist work with me on stuck points and it has made my symptoms significantly better.  My ability to detect toxic thoughts before they go any further has improved a lot too which has made me all around much healthier for myself and my partner.

1cr5jp9,"Agreeing with another comment, the questions do feel inspired by stereotypes based off of the first page.

Question 7 for example - I don’t necessarily think/feel *all the time* that I “should” do something to avoid situations/feelings. Personally, I can handle unpleasant feelings sometimes, but other times it can become too much and I’ll want to do things to avoid it. Do I “believe I should” do that in general? No, the rational part knows better. Do I sometimes do that anyway? Sure, the irrational doesn’t care.

Just a note: The way the questions/answer options are worded, it seems like it’s asking for a concrete answer. But it’s hard to provide an accurate answer when I know I’d probably answer each question differently every day just based on my mood and self-image at the time. “I relate” instead of “I believe” might be more useful, or even offering an option that says “I believe sometimes” instead of/below “I believe slightly”.",post_verone,False,1715668265.0

My breakthrough in realising my boyfriend was abusive was when I was venting about him to a friend who outright said ""this sounds like emotional abuse, I'm worried about you"". Or at the beginning of your next session, say you want to discuss something before getting into the actual therapy and describe what he's been doing and saying and whether it sounds like you're splitting in her professional opinion, and ask outright if it sounds like it is a healthy relationship. It's hard for anyone who is in an abusive relationship to see it, and even harder for people who are otherwise vulnerable on top of that (i.e. having BPD).

You don’t really know who this person is, how they’ll treat you in the coming weeks, months & years, how their values and nuances of their personality will mesh with or trigger yours, etc. If you’re going purely off of attraction and the initial phase where people are able to put the charm on and present ideal versions of themselves, you’re putting yourself into a somewhat precarious position by throwing yourself all in all at once. 

If you were to take the time to know and understand this person well- dive deep into their values, past, figure them out and spend enough time with them to see their more negative sides and how they respond to problems in their life & your connection, treat you when you’re going through things, etc. *before* becoming too attached to walk away, I think there is no need to be worried about “moving quickly.” 

I.e. there is no set “timeline” you need to worry about following- what you should be worried about is how well you actually know someone before becoming so attached to them that if they started switching up (as many people who jump all in all at once tend to do) it would ruin your peace and stability.",Td998,False,1715357525.0

1cmuhry,"I appreciate what comment. I thought that many a time and I always fall back in. The problem that exists not just for her but for all of those incarcerated by the way hers is addiction that's why she's been there, there's no help available to them. Not real help anyway. Just been in and out of jail and prison for over 23 years because she's been addicted for over 23 years. This time around she finally understands that there's something wrong with her and that this is what it is but when she spoke to the psychiatric doctor about it the doctor told her not only is that possible, it's probable but there's nothing I can do. I can't diagnose you with that because it's a personality disorder and I don't know your personality. Inmates get 5 minutes a month with that doctor which is basically to refill medication but it's definitely not enough time for that doctor to learn their personality and diagnose them. And then whatever this counselor is in the prison that she gets once a month actually told her that she may have had it before but she doesn't now because people grow out of it. The only growth she's made is honestly because of the books that I've sent and I used to read chapters of the BPD workbook into the jail messaging system one at a time and send them and then we would go over them later. That was before I was able to send books to her. And 65 to 90% of Alex have an underlying personality disorder so how many of those people are in and out of jail like her running in this hamster wheel not even knowing that they need help some of them because that's how they've always been there entire life so they don't know that there's any difference. It's really sad and I am the only person in the world that understands the BPD aspect and doesn't look at her like she's just another addict. And I know that the best thing I can do for her is probably go no contact because I did that for about 3 weeks after she said something honestly that was brutal and hurtful and I can't unhear, and that was the time that she made the most significant growth. I had to contact again because I had a situation with the dogs that wouldn't have been fair enough to tell her about so I am back in contact again. I did notice that the growth and understanding in her messages started to dwindle again once I became that crutch again. But then I went back to not no contact but less contact and less personal in the messages and more of just informational type things. I've been all along transcribing YouTube videos into text and sending them in messages and I sent one from a codependency and addiction specialist about why sorry isn't enough. And she actually took the time to go back and reread it until she understood it and then sent me a long message about it. Last night she sent me a message about how someone who she's friendly with in there can't speak to her and her DPT book was on the bed and this girl asked her about it and she talked to her about it a little bit and that ignited some realization and this girl and she went to her the book I sent called The Big book on borderline personality disorder. So I understand and I'm understood all along that self-diagnosis isn't the way to go but when you're dealing with this situation when you add in this variable being incarcerated there's honestly no other option. You at least need to get the information to them so that they can start to realize that there might be a possibility of this and then they can search out their own help when they get out. But when they get out they need that motivation. So that's what I'm trying to get I'm trying to get that understanding and empty and people that can relate to them  so that they come out of there thinking that there's a better way.",Full-Pineapple3052,True,1715186921.0

You want something from your partner: attention, affection, intimacy. These are EXTREMELY NORMAL needs that healthy people have.

The problem is she is in prison and cannot get access to other treatment or a diagnosis.

I thought some therapy would be better than nothing but I'm not sure if she is not doing right by her or if maybe my partner isn't being completely honest. That is a possibility

My first red flag was when she asked me why I was tired and I told her I had just had a therapy session. She asked me why it was emotionally draining for me and said hers is easy.

Then she told me that she won't diagnose her because she may have had it but doesn't now because people grow out of it

1ceql3r,"I appreciate the comment. My concerns are that she doesn't know what she needs right now because she's getting inaccurate advice from the person who is supposed to be the one in authority and in the knowledge you know what I mean?

If the therapist herself is saying people grow out of this and I don't see that in you and that may have been how you were but I don't see that now etc and she makes the decision to leave prison and go to a halfway house versus a treatment facility because she's following the advice of the prison therapist then that's setting herself up for failure

And I kind of feel almost like that's not entirely her fault if she's following the advice of the prison therapist that's what I'm trying to get at. Exactly what is being said obviously I won't know but this is either a person who is not a doctor or not experienced a personality disorders or simply on the prison payroll to keep people reoffending

I gave her the previous comments in a message hoping that she would be more inclined to believe people that have been through this

And I pointed out that you can't even tell me her name let alone her credentials so at this point in time I keep thinking you don't have anybody if I step back but at the same time I have to realize it's my codependency speaking

That you in fact do have yourself. You're a grown woman you know what's wrong with you now and it's up to you to get the information as best you can now and then really do your own research when you get out

I sent books I've sent articles and you choose whether or not you read them. And when it comes down to two people telling you the exact opposite it comes up to you to research your own answer

I've provided proof of everything I've ever said to you and it's a direct opposite of what this person is telling you. My only goal would be for you to get better where hers could be either to just get through the shift or possibly not really give the best information because that keeps people getting rearrested which keeps money flowing into the system

Inmates equal income in this world. So I blocked the phone again and I'm only sending messages that have information in them. Because every time I hear her voice I start the cave and especially if I'm hearing information that's wrong it makes me jump into gear and feel like I need to get the right information to her

Like I said she's 43 years old and knows what's wrong now. And now it's up to her to learn that what she feels isn't fact and just because she feels like she could do this now off by herself doesn't mean she can't

It's been 3 years and a year and a half of knowing it's BPD and trying to get the information to her but it's only been fairly recent that she's wrapped her head around it and accepted it

I sent the big book on borderline personality disorder, Dr Fox's borderline personality disorder workbook and a DBT workbook as well as a journal

I transcribed YouTube videos into text and send them in messages

That's the only access to real information she's going to get in there.

The problem is is that transition. Between getting out and getting help. If she goes into a 90-day treatment facility that at least provides a physical barrier between her and the drugs she's got a chance. If she goes into a halfway house and is meant to find her own therapy I don't see after 23 years of addiction and an untreated mental disorder such as this allowing for that success to happen

She did tell me yesterday that arrangements are being made for her go someplace safe because she realized after thinking about it but asking to come back and live with me again was not only out of line but also not smart because she can't even be in this county let alone be with me

So when sitting and thinking she comes up with the right answer but she still immediately making impulsive decisions

So if she makes an impulsive decision to go to the wrong place and what's up with access to drugs I promise you she'll be high in a day and it's only a matter of time for she's rearrested and we do this all over again

So I decided I can't keep going on this Merry-Go-Round until she shows me that she's doing the right thing

Right now all I've got is her word and over the last 3 years the compulsive lying gaslighting projection only shows that her word is no good right now

And that's another thing she doesn't understand. One day she'll agree that she understands why I don't trust her and then the next minute it's at some point you're going to have to trust me again. Which is true but that has to start once you stop actually lying and start doing the work

So I basically got nauseous when I heard that she was told she grew out of it because it's almost not fair to blame her for listening to the person that's supposed to be her counselor

I appreciate the form to vent and all the help that you guys are giving me because it wasn't until I found groups of people that actually have this disorder and are indifferent levels of recovery that I've really gotten a good understanding of what's going on inside her head

She hasn't been able to really Express anything until recently. And it took a three week no contact for her to get to that point

So another thing I told her is that we can't look at the actual growth we have to look at what caused the growth and what caused the growth was a no contact.

And what started my healing process was the no contact

What started my healing backsliding was ending with no contact

And we went from no calls to back to trying the daily calls so that's her growth being stunted because of the ending of the no contact

So while it sucks that's what has to happen because I can't be a crutch and she can't be my only purpose

The prison system really is designed to help people continue to fail. And I just feel like if she was out and had her own access to everything then I would feel a lot better about stepping back and saying it's up to you. But since she doesn't have the access and she's trapped basically and limited to what she has access to I feel like I can't let go until I know she's going to be okay I make the correct choices

I could be wrong but maybe we're not used to happiness or haven't experienced it much. So, when it comes, it feels overwhelming due to its intensity and frightening because of its unfamiliarity. Is it that sadness and other emotions stemming from trauma are all we know, and therefore become our comfort zones? I feel that's very likely

1cba0es,"Splitting and no contact are completely separate things. No contact isn't harmful, don't even begin to think so. No contact does not involve springing from obsession to hatred- it is a fair, conscious response to abuse, trauma, and disrespect. Likewise, splitting isn't a conscious choice. We often do it without even noticing or thinking.

These categories are very, very, very different and I would advise against comparing them. No contact is NOT a BPD behavior and it is NOT harmful. It is a healthy enforcement of boundaries that you, for valid reasons, feel have been crossed. I hope this doesn't come off as rude, I'm just kinda curious/concerned as to why you made this connection and I don't want you beating up on yourself for setting a healthy boundary.

1cba0es,"I was no contact with a parent for about two years because despite them displaying lots of willingness to understand, I still experienced an abiding feeling of oppression with them due to what I perceived as rigid underlying beliefs about my identity, who I was supposed to be. These beliefs I had about their thoughts abided long after our brief exchanges in the phone or over text, and filled me with apprehension day in and day out. I decided to cut ties for a while, communicating mainly through my other parent and it was, indeed, good to focus on myself.

While we are on good terms now, we are still not close. Not like other people may be able to enjoy closeness with their parents. I am still not close to either of them. I am older now than I was then and they are too. They’ve had major illnesses they waited to tell me about until things were stable. In hindsight, I now wish I had acted differently in the past, so I could be the responsible adult child, one of the first people they call to maturely handle such things alongside them. Granted, that’s not something they’d have been as capable of when I initially went no contact, as they’ve grown too, but I wonder how much further along we would be now if I had stuck it out back then.

While I don’t necessarily regret this period of no contact, as I age I realize what I most wanted was actually that brave sort of intimacy where you have to burst beyond just “good terms” to genuine connection, challenge, and potentially painful conversations. In many ways, my constant neurodivergent frustration that the world doesn’t more often operate on that wavelength led me to the dangerous levels of emotional self repression and intimacy denial which exacerbated my BPD symptoms in the past.

If you are someone who wants to cultivate a relationship with this parent, who to me from this account, sounds as if they have not perpetrated serious abuse or betrayal, I would challenge you to be honest about your feelings around the “real trauma” and try not to gloss over it if you are considering no contact. Let this parent meet the challenge. 

It sounds like no contact would harm and cause considerable distress to this parent who so badly wants to be on good terms, an urge probably stemming from their own anxiety and insecurity about your relationship which shouldn’t really be your job to handle for them, I agree. But this parent is alive for the first time too, like we all are, and family relationships are paralyzingly important and intimate and scary sometimes.

Challenging them with honesty, admitting you’re feeling this pressure and feeling an urge for distance while they seek closeness, and seeing how they face that truth will inform you much better whether limiting contact is the right call, as opposed to your current very distanced texting based relationship.

The parents of BPD people often have lived lives as emotional children for much of their adulthood. They might have suffered traumas which seriously limit their ability to relate, as you may have to develop BPD.  So I don’t doubt this parent is challenging to relate to. But please try not to be led by what a therapist once said and instead try to tap into your intuition, and the feelings which well up in you when you consider the situation. You know yourself and your heart far better than any third party clinician.

No, I appreciate you being straightforward and clarifying the differences. I guess I linked them to one another because NC could be seen as extreme, especially after being on okay terms with my parent. It resembles actions I've done before where I would do things I'm not okay with on the inside then end up reacting in an extreme way later on because of the dissonance. That's why it feels like splitting to me.",ComprehensiveSun8429,True,1713905356.0

Same, I'm having a hard time determining my boundaries in general. It's a lot of work in progress. 

>Now middle aged and doing it is much harder, more trauma and pain, sounds like you’re much better informed and certainly considering your actions before you take them. 

I won't pretend to understand what that's like, but there's no definitive right or wrong time to start addressing these matters. It's challenging to understand oneself while steeped in trauma. These things often require significant time to acknowledge and address. Furthermore, your individual circumstances can also influence the outcome. I'm only where I am now because I'm finally distant from my family. So, I try to be compassionate towards my past self. They did the best they could with what they had, and so are you.

Let this parent meet the challenge. 

I've already tried, but they only view themselves as victims of their circumstances. When I suggested that this cannot be a justification, their response was seeking forgiveness, given the limited time they feel they have left and that they're human (again, a victim). I've attempted to accept this, but it only brings me more distress. Statements like these prevent me from fully processing and understanding the impact of their actions on me because I'm now busy feeling guilty for them. There's also an aspect of intergenerational trauma which they are in complete denial about and think that they had a good life with no abuse. 

I've raised this issue in the past, but they refused to acknowledge the possibility of their own abuse. Addressing this ""real trauma"" would mean dismantling core aspects of their identity. Neither am I capable of doing this, nor do I believe they could process it without a complete emotional breakdown.

>Challenging them with honesty, admitting you’re feeling this pressure and feeling an urge for distance while they seek closeness, and seeing how they face that truth will inform you much better whether limiting contact is the right call, as opposed to your current very distanced texting based relationship.

Yes, I can give that a try. I believe I need to be more straightforward about my feelings instead of suppressing them, only to find myself in this same situation again later.

>But please try not to be led by what a therapist once said and instead try to tap into your intuition, and the feelings which well up in you when you consider the situation. You know yourself and your heart far better than any third party clinician.

The therapist's words are obviously not gospel but why shouldn't I agree with them if what they're saying aligns with what I've seen and experienced? They’re there to help when elements such as my intuition and feelings, which are largely influenced or even entirely formed by the nurture from authority figures like parents, fail to identify abuse.

1cb9tv3,"I worked in a tier 4 adolescent psychiatric facility for about a year. While you’d be in a lower tier facility (assuming your stay is voluntary), there are some things that will probably be relevant. Residential facilities are not as effective for treatment as they are meant to be, but they are more effective than they are generally portrayed as being. The vast majority of residents aren’t there bc they want to be, they’re there because they or their guardian wants them to get better. Even if someone has a specific established treatment plan, their treatment as well as daily routine will follow the general path of the unit’s goals - so finding a facility with the closest specialty to your needs or dx is important. I.e., a depression/suicide unit’s rules group therapy and routine will all be centered around harm prevention and treating depression. If a resident wasn’t a troublemaker, a lot of their time beyond treatment and routine was avoiding boredom. The more they focused on reaching treatment goals, the shorter they needed to stay. The food will almost certainly be bland and follow a 1-2 week cycle. My one main piece of advice to someone expecting to be admitted would be to get in, get done, and move on. In-patient treatment’s main advantage is the accelerated pace of treatment and recovery. You’ve heard of what happens in Vegas? People do crazy stuff in mental facilities they’d never do outside it, because it’s the safe place you can get it out. As long as you remember what you’ve learned, it’s okay and in fact beneficial to not dwell on the things you do and people you meet. Holding on to those means you don’t move forward.

1c7vent,"Just gonna be honest here. It sounds like you are expecting a lot out of him and probably not communicating any of it. Partners are not mind readers, and just because you feel like someone SHOULD do something does not mean that they NEED to or even that they know that you're expecting that of them. I find ""he knew I was out with no car \[...\] for 4 hours and he didn't bother to ask to pick me up even though he was off work early"" -- consider this: you acknowledge there was a storm, yes? Would you want him to be out in it too or would you rather be on probably sturdier public transportation, knowing he is safe? Did you ask to be picked up or are you just expecting this?  
  
""I lash out on him and get angry \[...\] I always told him how communicating consistently for me is everything.""  
Is it mutual though? Or is ""communication"" just when it's convenient for you? Do you ask him questions or are you just expecting this of him? Do you communicate your needs or do you just expect him to know them? Again, this is not meant to come off as accusatory but check your facts, and see if there are gaps.

""\[...\] like who can go a whole week without calling their significant one there is just 0 valid reason for that""  
I can. It depends on the person and their lifestyle. You two are just dating, you are not married and therefore consider your commitment to each other flexible at best. This man does not live with you, he has his own job and his own life and if you are getting angry at him for just expecting him to put you first all the time? Respectfully, I wouldn't want to talk either. Plus, some people are just like that. Some people are introverted. You said yourself this is a long distance thing, and there is no qualification to speak every day, every other day, or even once a week.

""I tell him I am miserable in the relationship \[...\]""  
Then end it?

""\[...\] hoping he would fix everything""  
Relationships are mutual, and you cannot expect someone to fix something no matter what. You have the capability to fix things too. You say you are miserable and yet you aren't ending this. Why?

""all he says is ""well I'm glad you're doing good now""  
I'm sorry, but what else should he say? What's wrong with this statement? He's glad you're okay. Is that not enough? Communicate that somehow, then. Don't just seethe over it.

BPD is hard, I know. I have it too, and it's so difficult to navigate relationships even without BPD. Please remember though that we have to hold ourselves accountable. Your diagnosis does not excuse you from effectively communicating your needs with people nor does it excuse lashing out needlessly. You are allowed to be upset and angry and feel all sorts of things, but try not to take them out on other people. I know some of this does sound harsh but please believe that it is coming from a person who has been through things like this. Don't stress so much about the future. You can and will find a person who is right for you, it doesn't mean it has to be now. Focus on yourself and recovering if you have to, there's nothing wrong with that.

1c7vent,"hi so the thing is that all of my relationships were mostly lived online. Because in my country living together when not married is frowned upon and my mind is constantly messed up making it impossible for me to earn a living. The thing about online relationships is that when the most important and special person in your life, the one who is supposed to understand you the most and care for you the most is not by your side, you are left alone and caring for yourself. Initially it's very romantic because we would dream together about how our life would be once we start living together and earning and all that. But there's no going out together, there's no Spending nights together traveling together, when you cry you cry alone when you have a BPD episode you are alone and you want your partner to be there for you so bad yet it's almost certain that he/she won't be there for you. There's no sex or physical intimacy on a constant basis. There's not going to be a shoulder to cry on. Ultimately yes I do have a partner but the more you suffer the more you realise you only have one in concept. I mean I am an extremely extremely needy person and all my needs were met through texts and phone calls. At some point in a relationship I would understand that the right thing for me and my partner is a breakup but I felt like I was cheating on the other person if I broke up with them. How can I be so romantic in the beginning and just abandon my partner when it's inconvenient for me. I felt like I was being selfish. So I would continue in the relationship. But trying to not be selfish made me an extremely selfish person. I would lash out more. I would get highly unreasonable. I would have very little semblance to the person I used to be in the beginning of a relationship. I would hate myself for who I was becoming. Me trying to be selfless caused the other person soooo much more harm. Yet the concept of having a person in such a role is so desirable that I keep falling into the trap of online relationships.

The realizations are indeed personal, but I can imagine I'm not alone in most of them.

1c421oo,"Hey! So the numbness usually comes from dissociation  - it's something a lot of us BPD folks do to avoid feeling everything so strongly. When you have BPD, emotions are felt tenfold. When you're happy, you're elated, when you love, you love hard, when you're angry, you rage, when you're sad, you feel as though you'll never be happy again. Dissociating allows us to hide from our overwhelmingly negative emotions, but unfortunately, it also numbs the positive ones too. Being in a relationship with someone who is in a perpetual state of dissociation can be like loving a ghost - the person you love is only partly there. Unfortunately, you can't love someone into loving themselves, and you can't fix anything if he isn't equally as invested in doing that work. He needs to realise that life is a lot better when you allow yourself to **feel**, regardless of whether it's negative or positive. Emotions never stay hidden for long, and the harder he pushes them away, the harder they will demand to be felt. And you deserve better than to be in a relationship with a ghost, to feel like their love for you is something that can disappear and reappear, it's not fair to you. I know, because I lost the person I loved the most by not being able to love them in the way they deserved to be loved, because I was too scared to **feel** - to feel sad, bored, lonely, happy, unsure, in love. In the end, I lost them, and that hurt a hell of a lot more than if I would have just been **present**, for it all. I hope he doesn't make the same mistake. He needs to realise that he needs professional help, and to do it for you, but mostly, for himself. Life is meant to be lived, fully and wholly, the good and the bad.

Your BPD is a complex network of trauma responses, high emotions, and the resulting defense mechanisms (eg. biting, in your case) are the result of trauma. Remember that this is not your fault. Remember that there's a glimmer of you in there, even when it feels like your BPD is completely out of control. You're still there, and you are a good person.

You're in therapy, so there's a good chance that you want help, and that you've dedicated significant time to it. I'm not dissing people with Narcissistic PD here, but how many narcissists do you think actually go to therapy?

Also, I see you say ""I thought I'd change."" Were you... making any changes yourself? I mean this as nicely as possible, because it comes from a place of relatability. I had this notion that, to recover, I didn't need to actively ""do"" anything- just go to therapy, and that was that. I'm ""better,"" and everyone's happy, right? Not really. You need to put your individual effort in, too. You need to take what you talk about in therapy and apply it to situations like this, whether that's in the moment or afterward. I'm saying ""need"" because you seem to want to recover, really bad. But it's not something you ""need"" to do- it's being respectful to yourself and your loved ones.

Has your therapist given you any ideas on how to handle yourself when you're triggered? Have you considered getting up and leaving the room (just an example, not saying it'll work for you) to calm down before you cause harm to somebody else? Reminder, it's totally okay if you haven't considered these things!!! We need plenty of reminders about our coping skills before we actually use them. I'm struggling with the same thing- I'm still learning how to regulate myself before I explode. My friends often need to tell me to calm down, and it's only then I even realize I was getting worked up.

Is your therapy DBT? If not, here's a brief summary - It is actually originally designed BY a person with BPD, FOR people with BPD. It gives you great ammo on how to deal with your emotions at different levels of intensity.

I'd get started here:
https://dialecticalbehaviortherapy.com/

It's a free online course of DBT. There are plenty of work books available online that you can also use simultaneously to practise (recommended). The point in DBT is that the skills that it teaches you need to be actually practised over and over again until they become a habit. Like YEARS. It's a long process to replace all those unhealthy coping mechanisms and bad reactions. But it IS possible.

It's not always magic, but for me personally, it's pretty foolproof. Plus, this is something that can be collaborative!

You have to accept the consequences of your actions. 

It seems like you’ve edited your post, because you’d previously said you’ve hit people, etc. 

Instead of saying “I didn’t do anything except X”, own up to it. “I did this thing and that was wrong of me”. 

If you’re worried about how people feel about you or burning bridges, talk to them, apologize, take accountability. 

“Hey X, I know that I did this, I’m sorry, and you didn’t deserve that. I know I was upset but I had no right to do that.”

The important thing is to not expect them to accept your apology—apologize because you mean it, because you value that person and their feelings. Let them make the decision. 

Learn from your actions. Therapy will help, it’s helped me be more mindful of others but as well as myself. 

Learn new coping skills, there are plenty of DBT workbooks, mindfulness exercises, etc.

You have to stop making excuses for yourself and your abusive actions. 

Bpd is an explanation, not an excuse.

And please do not take this as attacking you; I’m not. But sometimes things don’t need to be sugarcoated; they shouldn’t. Your actions are harmful to others, and yourself. Look at how they make you feel after the fact.

I am already super ashamed of my diagnosis and I always feel as though people are judging me and I am inadequate.  So to hear these people talk about people like me that way... Saying we are incapable of love, evil emotionless, soulless, violent succubi... So disheartening.  They talk about us as though we are lepers, not human, and should be sequestered on an island somewhere to protect all the good, decent ""normal"" people.

It is funny because I experience emotion (both high and low) stronger than anyone I know.  And I desperately want someone to love and bond with and make happy. But no one will give me a chance.  And I have NEVER done anything violent and never will.  

I wish these people could understand the pain we go through.  How bad it is, to know what you are about to do is illogical but to do it again for the umpteenth time, knowing exactly what will happen.  I wish I could impress upon them that we are living breathing human beings who feel pain like everyone else.  That we don't want to be this way and would give ANYTHING to be different.  I have been on meds and in therapy for 25 years.  Nothing helped, even DBT.  Just started a second round of DBT and I am giving it my all.

It's ironic because they accuse us of having no empathy... Where is their empathy for us?  Drug addicts, alcoholics, cheaters, everyone feels sympathy for these people, when their behavior was at least in part voluntary.  But no sympathy for people who rolled the genetic dice and came up snake eyes?  

I understand they have been hurt.  Badly.  But I have been hurt horribly too.  And I still feel empathy for the people who hurt me, because they are human.  I don't think I am categorically better than them and I wouldn't go online and speak of everyone who is like them as though they are some kind of nasty parasite or virus and not human.

Honestly all these people do is prevent people from getting treatment (no one who suspects they have it wants to get branded with a scarlet A) and make people lie/hide their diagnosis.  I used to tell potential SOs about my diagnosis... I am an honest person (despite their contention that we are all inveterate liars) and I want someone who wants me for me, flaws and all.

1by9soc,"The next step after awareness is REALLY hard, and you're grappling with it right now: acceptance. I'm going through this too. It is IMMENSELY painful to admit we've done some things that are really unsavory, but also remember you are more than your diagnosis. Your BPD is not your fault, it was given to you through trauma; you deserve to love yourself despite a very difficult illness. In fact, I think pwBPD deserve to love themselves more, because of what we have and what we've been through.

Now the acceptance thing. Yep. We do shitty stuff. We say shitty things, and sometimes we fuck shit up beyond repair. But what has brought me the most comfort is choosing to break the cycle and change, no matter how guilty I feel, how embarrassed I am to be this way. The best way to lessen my guilt, personally, is to change what makes me feel guilty. And my BPD makes me feel unreasonable, irrational levels of bad emotions. I deserve better. We all do. I know this can all sound like a load of bullshit when you're really going through it, so feel free to be pissed at me or feel like I missed the mark. You're allowed. But I do hope this helped a little bit ♥️

ETA: also, what people say about BPD online is so, so much different than the real, person-to-person experience. People that spread terrible generalizations about BPD have never met you. They do not know you, and they don't have enough perspective to understand that every pwBPD presents VERY differently. I can tell you this- I have BPD, and I'm a good person.

I totally get what you mean about what people say online, it can be so brutal and it feels so unfair since people with bpd only have it because of trauma that happened to us. We are not bad people. You’re gonna have lows and mess up, but that’s something everyone does. Bpd just makes everything feel so much worse than it is.

1by9soc,"Hmmmm... lots of ways tbh, but some are more accessible than others (eg. I can't just tell you to ""get a solid support system"" or ""be like me and have a borderline best friend."" I know it's not that easy 😭😭) I think my biggest step early on was separating my BPD diagnosis from my genuine identity. This made me able to even conceptualize that I'm a good person, made me start being able to accept that I can move past borderline someday.

Here's what I tell myself: I am NOT my BPD, my BPD is not attached to my brain permanently. I am a person WITH BPD, if that makes sense. I still need to take responsibility for the harmful things my BPD causes me to do, but I know deep down that it's not who I am- it's an elaborate network of defense mechanisms and trauma responses. My harmful behaviors and coping skills used to keep safe, and I truly thank and appreciate them for that. However, I'm finally beginning to learn that it's okay to let things go when they start to not feel good anymore. I'm allowed to let go of behaviors that make me feel bad, and let me tell you, my borderline behaviors make me feel VERY bad. Ofc, letting go is an active process.

Also, LOTS of very hard, emotional conversations with the people I love. My close friends and I have an unofficial system where as soon as my BPD presents itself in an unhealthy or harmful way (eg. I lash out at someone, leave a social event without telling anyone bc I'm overstimulated, etc.) we have a debrief or discussion ASAP. We go over what triggered me (if I know; otherwise we figure it out together,) what behavior I exhibited that was harmful, and if I realized what was happening while it was going on (usually, no, i have no idea what i'm doing lol. Still working on awareness myself!!)

Then we move on to what we all can do better next time; how I can maybe catch this behavior before it spirals out of control, how I can regulate an unpleasant emotion before it explodes out of me, and how I can ask the people around me for help when I need it. Accommodating for myself and my illness has made me so much more pleasant to be around lol. You just have to find the people willing. Help them help you, if that makes sense. ♥️♥️

Hope this helps a little bit. I also really like journaling, just to figure out what my mind is doing when I feel upset; soooo much of learning self-awareness is just constantly taking moments to check myself. When I wake up, I ask myself how I'm feeling. As I'm eating breakfast, I do it again. When I sit down at my work desk, ask myself if I need to go to the bathroom and take a few deep breaths before I get into it. Slowing down my life has helped me slow down my brain, and when my brain is slower, I am way better at understanding it. I have to remind myself that my brain is not a beast to be conquered, it's not this huge scary supercomputer, it's not another dimension. It's MY brain; it's me. The best I think I can do is try to understand me.

It often feels like a stupid obligation and that I'm fine. It's everyone else that's the issue.

What I'm realizing, though, is that my feelings are always valid, but the behavior that results from those feelings is not.  I don't know if you also feel this way but I'm sick and tired of hurting the people I love. I'm sick and tired of hurting MYSELF. It feels dumb and unfair that I ""have"" to get better, and in reality, nobody does. You don't have to if you don't want to. I'm not forcing you. But I am MISERABLE when I'm not trying to recover. I push away friends, family, and even stop caring about my pets. I'm always unhappy and I want to die. I got sick of living like this, and that is the only reason I decided to change. It's not from a place of punishment, it's from a place of self love. I want to be better, so I'm getting better. It's completely for me at this point, and that's the way recovery should be.

As a consultant and trainer I was offered certification in an online program in DISC/EQ (not a fan of DISC or MBTI or horoscopes or anything that encourages people to put others in boxes but the certification was given to me gratis). In the ‘emotional intelligence’ assessment I scored very very high on social awareness and relationship management, but shockingly low on self awareness and self management (I took the course before incidents that led me to DBT). My overall ‘EQ’ was so low that the trainer was shocked and openly discussed the unusual results in the group until I PMed him to please move on. 

Much later in my DBT program I mentioned this to my psychologist. His take was that (some) pwBPD become acutely aware of others (social awareness) and people pleasers (relationship management) as a trauma response/defense mechanism to try to keep others happy and reduce abandonment. Additionally we often don’t understand or trust our own emotions (self awareness) because we seem to experience them so differently than those around us; and we struggle with self-management due to the pain of emotional dysregulation.

1bxjx4a,"We had similar suffering in our home and we were able to reduce the intensity of the Emotionally Dysregulated Events (EDEs) but they are still going to happen. I fundamentally changed how I responded to the EDEs to protect my own mental health and help my family.

There are a lot of things that have to happen for this behavior to diminish and it can take a year or more. The improvements will be gradual and hopefully you can maintain your sanity throughout.

One of the most important things is that you can not control another person's behavior only influence it. It is much easier to prevent EDEs from happening by not engaging and following simple house rules before it starts rather than spending your limited mental health resources dealing with the actual event (splitting) in a crisis situation.

First off, phone time is regulated in our house due to smart phone addictions.  The basic frame work is our young adults get their smart phone between 7 and 10 at night. There was a lot of push back on this, but it is a rule to stay in our house, if you want free room and board. They know that they have an addiction and that it is bad for their mental health, especially if they are on it all day. They know about the dopamine cycle and the ""feels good"" that comes along with the phone time is not normal or healthy to everyday life. Life is boring. Life is work. Life is hard. Excessive phone time distorts this reality such that all they want is to be on their phone and nothing else. We have had numerous arguments and physicality over the phone, but over time it has stabilized. I control the router setting for wifi access but I never ""take"" their phones, they have to hand them in respectfully and on time. We all agree during our family meeting that this is important for family unity and to prevent conflict. Phone time is the main commodity that we use to reward good behavior. It is important to have something like this for motivation. Note one of our kids (Non BPD but still complex mental health concerns) is attending an alternative school and he gets to take his phone with him because he is passing and being successful. However he still has to take pass it in at 10 at night and take a break between 5-7 everyday, this is not unreasonable as it aligns with supper time and our family meeting hour.

In our household, we have both House rules and Family Connections rules. House Rules are straight forward - clean you room, Personal hygiene is important. etc while family connection rules are more behavior related - No Putdowns, say I love you everyday, etc.  These are custom to our family and are based on the things we need to do as a family to keep everyone safe and to respect our property. We sit down as a family for a maximum of 60 minutes, every day at 6pm.  In practice 3-4 meetings go the full hour, 2-3 meetings are 30-45 minutes due to late start and 1-2 days per week we may skip the meeting but this is only if it is unavoidable and things in the household are going smoothly. One of the rules list (house or FC) are read out everyday so that everybody is on the same page. New rules get added as needed. Often we play a game of trouble (dice popping game) for the last 15 minutes. Family connections are about increasing the positive interactions.

The meetings are simply a conversation at the supper table talking about everyday things, concerns, feelings, whatever. Sometimes we do ""therapy type stuff"", such as how to handle emotions, self esteem, etc. Other days, it could be whatever is on the kids minds as this gives them a channel to voice their concerns. We then problem solve different ways to deal with their concerns. The essence or tone of the meeting is very important, as the meetings are not  a ""He said She said"" type battleground but rather a ""Help me to understand your concerns and how best I can support you"". So while disciplinary actions and consequences may be necessary, they are delivered in a ""I am putting this support in place to help you to control your outbursts so that we keep our home a safe place. Do you agree? any suggestions?""

Another thing with my loved one with BPD ( lowBPD) is that they are very focused on the present with little regard to the future. So when a new rule or consequence is put in place, it does not impact the past behavior just the future behavior. Some people might say that you are letting them get away with it, but my response is that I would much rather get solid agreement on how to manage their future behavior that I know will happen again. And when it happens again, I enforce the rule that everyone agreed to 100%, no changing conditions, no backing down, no second chances because you agreed to it. I play the long game rather than dealing with shorter term objectives when introducing new rules. When they complain about unfairness of the new rule I say this is not ""my problem"" - this is a you problem as you agreed to the rule - you have to change your behavior.  I simply do not engage, the rule stands.

Some parents might say that they do not have another hour in the day right after/before supper to discuss, but my response is that you will easily save that 1 hour or more throughout the day. If something comes up during the day, and I am feeling pressured for an answer then I will say, let me think about that and we can talk about it at our meeting. By having the 1hr family meeting everyday - I save wasted time throughout the day managing the outbursts and other little things. As well the conversation and support offered can improve your relationship as your lowBPD knows that you are trying to help them regulate their emotions.

A fundamental rule in our house is a 5 minute timeout when emotions are starting to emerge. We named the 5 minute rule ""Purple Giraffes"" as it is funny name and is intended to break through the emotional mindset when things are getting heated. The 5 min timeout is not a punishment, although it appears that way.  For adults, the rule is usually applied to one self.  ex: I see that you are getting upset and I am also starting to get upset, I am going to take a purple giraffes to calm myself down. We can continue this conversation in 5 minutes if you like. I'm going to put the timer on and go to my room to breathe. When the kids were younger, a purple giraffes meant they had to go to their rooms to calm down for 5 minutes like a timeout to calm yourself down not as a punishment. The only other thing is that the once the child was sent to their room, they had to ask for the timer to be started respectfully.

If your lowBPD is emotionally dysregulated (splitting)

a) Purple Giraffes -  leave the room so they can figure out a way to calm down on their own. I would use this once the voices are raised and definitely as soon as yelling starts. If you can't have a conversation then you need to calm yourself down.

b) Leave the house (if possible), say this is not a healthy environment - I do not feel safe.  I am going for a walk to calm myself down and to give you time to calm yourself.

c) If they escalate the situation in any way that is physically threatening or otherwise unsafe to themselves call emergency help line (911) or the mental health crisis team (if available).  Note: threats of suicide are always accompanied by a call to 911. There will be one warning before I call, but guess what happened after we had our second 911 visit - no more threats.

I will say that the first time, I called 911 - I thought I was abusing the service but nope, the mental health team that showed up was fantastic and greatly helped defuse the situation.

In response to your original question about how to handle the splitting. If your loved one is dysregulated then you should leave them alone to soothe themselves. By interacting with their poor behavior you are validating the behavior, by giving them attention. You can not soothe or calm down your loved one. They have to do it on their own and when they have an audience it is much harder.

This is all very overwhelming but keep in mind progress not perfection. It can take months to put a system like this in place and for it to become part of your everyday routine.

1bx9uw6,"Not familiar, but I quickly googled it and can understand how that could easily apply to a person with BPD. 

The sashbear model is the complete opposite of the identified patient. Family members receive DBT skills training so that they can manage their own emotions first and then help their loved one with BPD. The loved one with BPD is not involved with the skills training in anyway except to be on the receiving end of a wise mind approach. 

I also believe that the best way I can help my daughter is by showing her first hand that the DBT skills based training works. By changing my default response, I can minimize the negative aspects of her behavior and focus on the positive aspects of our relationship.  Long term this should help her self esteem and one day hopefully she will love herself just a bit.  The self-hate that comes with BPD makes it very challenging to care about the future.

I know that she always will have a challenging time regulating her emotions but sometimes all that is needed is to not engage with the behavior and walk away. If I come back in 5 minutes when things have calmed down, I can offer understanding with some form of support.

1bx5rnw,"Hi! I hear you. The four noble truths are a lot to take in and I also had a similar reaction to them at first. I'm not sure that radical acceptance equates to giving up hope here. Maybe it's more like accepting that everything is impermanent, including relationships, and still worthwhile to engage with. The second point in that excerpt doesn't mean that no emotion is pleasurable, just that no emotion is \*purely\* pleasurable. I interpret that to mean that even things like euphoria eventually end, and so there's a twinge of sadness there in knowing that it's impermanent. I like the translation of the first noble truth that says ""life contains suffering,"" it also contains joy. And along with the four noble truths is the eightfold path towards cessation of suffering. And none of those steps involve giving up hope. I'd recommend the book ""No Mud, No Lotus"" by Thich Nhat Hahn.",Sufficient_Pepper_90,False,1712393047.0
1bx5rnw,"I do think to a certain extent you're right-- life is incredibly painful, and the pain will only grow. But I also think the opposite is true. Life has a lot of painful things but also a lot of wonderful things, and your happiness still has a chance to grow even bigger, especially as you heal and grow as a person. I think one of the mistakes that we (people in general, not just pwBPD) make is believing that pain and happiness can't coexist. I am almost always sad, but there have still been moments I've spent with my loved ones where I've laughed so hard that my cheeks hurt, or when I've been so touched by a moment of kindness that I cried like a baby.

I also know what you mean about growing accustomed to abandonment and all of the pain that comes with it. The sad truth is that every relationship in our lives comes to an end at some point: some people walk out of our lives, some are forcibly dragged away, and some outlive us. But there's something I realized recently: just because something *ends* doesn't mean it failed. Just because you're no longer on good terms with someone, or someone breaks up with you, doesn't mean that there was never love there (and that person may even *still* love you-- you can love someone and still acknowledge that being close to them will do you more harm than good, even if it's not their fault). It's still okay to look fondly upon those past relationships and love those people, even if you can't be with them anymore.

All in all, I don't think accepting that life is painful and learning to deal with said pain means that you need to give up hope of ever being happy. It just means making space for that happiness to exist alongside your pain. I will always be sad about the trauma I've faced and the people I've loved and lost; but it doesn't have to stop me from loving people now and seeking out new experiences that make me happy.

One thing I've learnt about interpersonal relationships is, yes, most of them will end. There's no need to be afraid of abandonment, because it will inevitably happen. People drift apart, people change, people no longer care, they die, or whatever it is that happen. The most important thing is to learn to be alone. Reach that stage where you're fine with your own company. I view utility as separate from meaning. Interpersonal relationships bring about wellbeing because humans are social creatures.

- the stimulants have made my BPD symptoms go quiet. They’re legit a whisper. 
- the stimulants have made my depression become 85% better. Its so much better Im going to be lowering the dose of my Lamictal the end of this month to see how i do. 
- stimulants don’t work as well the week of my “period” (it’s not a true period because I’m on the pill)
- the week of my “period” my BPD symptoms came back with a vengeance on that Wednesday and lasted till that Sunday. So, a total of 4 days out of the month i had BPD symptoms. Once that Sunday was over, my BPD symptoms have been quiet again
-  the stimulants have improved not only my BPD and depression symptoms but my overall focus/concentration, executive dysfunction and overall energy are a so so so much better.

I would say DBT helped me the most. Ive had huge emotions my whole life, and was never believed for my genuine meltdowns, by parents or school. Learning to cope with those feelings and express myself appropriately was a skill that came with time, practice, and therapy.

My point is, I don't personally credit stimulants as doing much for me emotionally, other than reducing the stress I feel for having uncompleted work (hah, as I type this having procrastinated myself into a corner).

Quit alcohol mid 2019. Alcoholism was basically a giant tarp thrown over the BPD and related issues, keeping me or any counselor from getting to the root issues. I certainly *had* BPD before then.

Had a kid mid 2020.

Diagnosed BPD late 2020.

Started barely looking into DBT throughout 2021 while I looked for another counselor (the one that dx me ultimately wasn't a good fit). 

Got another counselor late 2021. Started doing DBT in earnest.

Left my abusive relationship early 2022. Also started reading up about CPTSD and trauma, which was very helpful.

Got a couples counselor to try and work through the abusive relationship in early-mid 2022. Found out quickly that my ex was aggressively against any kind of help and was actively sabotaging my own attempts to get better, practice DBT, etc. Dropped the couples counselor and chose my mental health over a garbage relationship in mid 2022.

Started doing DBT and looking into IFS therapy approaches from mid 2022 onward. Did it like it was my job. Books, workbooks, reminders all over my house, etc. Shit, I still have an emotion wheel on my fridge. This *was* my main hobby for almost a year.

Started a new relationship with an amazingly grounded, patient, understanding person in mid 2023. That turbo-charged everything I'd been working on because I had a supportive partner.

Literally this past Tuesday my counselor said I no longer fit the dx criteria for BPD. My homework for our next session is to decide whether I want to drop to monthly check-ins or quarterly or as-needed, etc.

1btf8k2,"CPTSD ADHD and quiet BPD/CO-dependant here.

I cope with my diagnosis as I understood it.
CPTSD is at the core of my issue, this one I share because it makes it relatable. 

ADHD because either trauma reactions take too much of my brain capacities or the fact that it started during a crucial phase in my development.
I sometimes share it as I am taking medication.

BPD is the set of coping mechanisms that I developed in order to survive with my trauma.
I identify less and less to it after lots of therapy. 

I do not share that one as almost nobody can relate.
If anybody ask I would explain that, due to trauma I developed disregulated emotions and that I just need time to ""collect and reflect"" .

I have shared my diagnosis but it has been used against me. It gave a free path to all the assholes I tend to associate with to blame me instead of taking ownership of their own malfunctions.

It's kind of disgusting seeing how people just turn a different tune after you say it. 
As said above, I said it from my need for validation.
I wanted people to understand me, to love me ""completely"".
Turns out,  it went the opposite way.
Turns out I need to love myself that much, nobody else's can understand myself as much as I do.

I am glad you're a therapist,  this is helping me so much when my therapist can relate to my internal turmoil or make it look less heavy.

People tend to think of personality disorders as a true crime show. For them you become evil and manipulative...
It's funny because many of those in my surroundings who overreacted have  themselves some kind of personality disorder too.

My ex partner even dared to put his lies and cheating  on my PD. His mother and sister labeled me as highly toxic while they are themselves way above the norm in that area.

It's like it's blinding self reflection for people.

Some of my friends reacted really well. Not precisely the people I thought would. Very securely attached people aren’t that scared, or people that already had a long therapy and know themselves well.

I really think it's time to reframe BPD for the public.
We are not all hysterical and manipulative.

I am for instance very controlling to MYSELF and give the benefit of the doubt to people I love without setting boundaries in fear of abandonment. 

If there is anger or emotional turmoil it's inward and people outside just see someone at most ""slightly irritated "".

My emotions run fast yes, again,  inwards.

You wouldn't label me as volatile. People think of me as ""emotional"" but before I tell them my diagnosis they tend to find it very manageable. 
After, all of the sudden, I am evil.
And if I dare yo put a boundary, which is very healthy, it suddenly become something else.

You'll be amazed by the amount of persons willing to put their wrongdoing onto your diagnosis if you tell.

I am usually for opening up about my mental state, but borderline is, with NPD, the ones you do not want to share.
Either people think the diagnosis is wrong (especially with quiet BPD) or do a 180° behavioral change and you become evil.

Even a sociopath could share his diagnosis with less  trouble honestly as we have had a bad rep on social media these last years.

All of my symptoms and co-morbidities come from long term trauma.

1btf8k2,"So, in my experience, I’ve told people that I’ve trusted in the past about this. My platonic friends? They have always been so accepting because they see me for who I am. I show up with enthusiasm and I always manage my emotions around them pretty well. My relationship partners? Well, I don’t think it’s ended well. All of my past traumas have been weaponized against me at some point. Just pretty much reading me to filth. Which is unfortunate because a.) when I first got diagnosed with BPD, I was struggling IMMENSELY from transitioning to adulthood. I suffered very extreme trauma as a child. I was overprotected and not allowed to develop normally as an adolescent. I was very, very socially inept. I was dealing with very complex PTSD. So, during my intake, at age 18, at a community college psychiatric office, I was diagnosed with BPD. I don’t align with that diagnosis, to be honest with you. I think i got misdiagnosed. I truly do believe I align more with my autism diagnosis. It makes abundantly more sense. Now, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the fact that I was diagnosed with BPD. It was very eye opening. But all of my partners, and I wouldn’t be surprised if my recent ex would say this, have all written me off as a “BPD ex”, when, in reality, I have sensory overload and years of trauma that I’ve handled to the best of my ability. I don’t snap at people. I don’t paint them black and white and I haven’t in years. I show empathy and I do my very best to respect boundaries once they are established. I enjoy spending my time alone. 
If you do decide to share that diagnosis, that is entirely your right and no one else’s. It is very stigmatized and I don’t really trust people that say they had a “crazy ex girlfriend” without giving any real context from both sides. Very neutral standpoint. 
I’ve yet to meet a person, namely a man,  who hasn’t demonized their ex without providing full context. Not that anyone is entitled to that, but a lot of people will simply PUSH women to their absolute emotional limit and when they have a strong reaction (i.e., reactive abuse), they are painted as monsters for finally sticking up for themselves.

1bq8jmv,"It seems really positive that despite you being told lots of judgements about yourself you also picked out some positives. Much better to have shades of gray about this!


The non-live in partners seem to be giving you difficulty in expressing yourself. Your live in partner seems to agree with the judgements made about you, although it's unclear because you've said he communicated them, but not if he felt them. 


I guess the main difficulty here is identifying what you want? If it's just to be left alone from these judgements, which might be reasonable, you can simply communicate ""I'm not interested in hearing that.""


If it's to persuade your partner to make you more comfortable at this other house - ie by sitting near you, then phrase it as a DEAR MAN. 




""Last time when we went to the other partner's house you went outside for a smoke, and when you came back you went to sit with your other partners. You've done this on multiple occasions, and recently you told me these partners are concerned we don't sit together enough.


I feel pretty upset/awkward/vulnerable (I don't know how you actually felt!) because it feels like this has become purely *my* responsibility.


I'd like you to take initiative and come sit by me when you come back from a smoke. (Or smoke beforehand or on the way, and just sit by me by when we're there!).""


Then if he tries to turn it on you, repeat the assertion - ""Next time we're there, I'd like you to stick with me"", and maybe follow it up with a reinforcement - ""It'd make me feel much more comfortable, and I do want to sit by you at these events"".

I have noticed that newly diagnosed people tend to talk about themselves and their condition a LOT when it comes to personality disorders or neurodivergence and it can get really boring and repetitive for the people around them.

I was really guilty of this until I met a new coworker who does it incessantly and that reflection back at me gave me serious ick! i do not want to be that person, so it really helped me reflect on and curb that behaviour. 

I find verbalising my feelings, situations and behaviour helps me process and learn but it's not always possible, do you have access to regular therapy? Even a support group that doesn't specify the individuals 'labels' but focuses on healthy behaviours using CBT or DBT for example. 

Talking can really help us, even the recommended treatment where I'm from is 'talking therapy', maybe one or more of your partners would be willing to listen for an hour a week to your thoughts on certain events or situations so you can process without judgement.

I currently am waiting for my first counselling appointment I've had several therapists in my life the last one is the one who diagnosed my BPD, OCD and PTSD but she moved out of my country sadly.

1bnyevo,"Hi OP

I had something similar. Outside of therapy I had two people I called for accountability. 1 was the primary and the other was secondary  

Having an accountability partner is hard because their role isn't to coddle you but to keep you on the straight an narrow. They listen amd empathise but don't make excuses for you which is hard during a BPD episode 
My second day was there to give my primary a break.... I eventually figured who I needed for what so that no 1 person was overwhelmed amd it worked great for everyone 

I'd suggest to find one amd do it in manner that works for you and your specific needs

""Emotional Sensitivity and Intensity: How to Manage Intense Emotions as a Highly Sensitive Person"" and ""The Gift of Intensity: How to Win at Life and Love as a Highly Sensitive and Emotionally Intense Person"" by Imi Lo helped me a good deal so far to re-frame what BPD actually *is* and start to move past the shame and stigma.

She outlines all of the positive traits of being highly sensitive, and also how a  BPD diagnosis can come from that, but also how BPD is on a spectrum, not a death sentence, and has crazy overlap with a whole host of other ""conditions"", while also not shying away from the fact that there are processes and behaviors that need changing to be able to thrive and lessen the extent to which we may cause harm to ourselves or others. 

So far it's been very uplifting and encouraging; these two may encapsulate what you're looking for. While the book is *technically* about HSP's, I would posit that 99% of pwBPD are inherently HSP's, and BPD is mentioned throughout.

1. It's great that you regulated the rage, didn't split, and channeled your anger into a Reddit post. Good on you for all of that;
2. Part of the rage we feel in such situations (I learned this recently) is feelings of overwhelming anger not simply for the trigger (the ridiculous selfishness of refusing to change the diaper), but also for forcing you to split / enter the red zone. Try to keep that it mind next time you're provoked. I'm finding that it's bringing a lot of perspective during episodes and helping to keep me level;
3. As a father of three who's been covered in urine, feces, and vomit too many times to count, you need to have a Come to Jesus with your husband re the childcare. What is he, 12 years old? I think I'd approach him calmly and say that he'll have one of two options the next time a poopy diaper appears while you're busy: a) Changing it, or, b) Wearing it.

>I want to support her through getting an assessment. And I wanna be there for her every step of the way.

Reading what you wrote, it seems that you want to take on way too much. Let me ask you a question - why? Why is it so important for you to be needed? Why do you want to take on a parental role? The best question you can ask yourself is what motivates me here? If I do all this for her, what will that say about me? Do I base my self-worth on being needed by others? Or sacrificing myself? Those are the hallmarks of codependence. Does focusing on her issues get me away from my own self-esteem issues?

This wouldn't be healthy for either of you. She would be dependent and you co-dependent. Yet you want to put so much energy into her. Did you have to emotionally take care of a parent and that's why this is normal for you? Because this would be taking on a parental role and would be enabling and reinforcing her and your codependence. 

What if you set healthy boundaries and honored her boundaries. She is taking some space. What if you respected that? If she reaches out, you can mention therapy but she has to want it. You can't change her. If she needs support, she will let you know. Honor that. Don't parent her and get enmeshed in her life. Take this time apart from her to focus all that energy on yourself. That would be heathy. I wish you the best.",GirlDwight,False,1710876018.0
1biacdn,">I want her to take the next step.

I'm sorry but you have no power here. What you want is irrelevant. Therapy doesn't work unless she wants it and she's motivated to get it. We can't control or change other people. Only how we respond to them. You like the potential in her but that's not the real her. The person you like doesn't exist. Being her friend means seeing who she is and accepting it.

1biacdn,"Sure you can DM. 

>I am doing it for me

Okay that's sounds like you want her to change for you. I'm sorry but that's not possible. And if she desires a parental role which most BPD's do, she'll be angry at you not filling it. It's a lose/lose. You become the parent, she doesn't change inside because you can't change from external validation and she is still angry at you because of her needs to place blame outwards and be the victim. If you put boundaries in place and engage, she gets angry that you won't be the parent. And again she is playing the blame on you for her emotions. So both these options are the opposite of helping her because they just reinforce her disorder of outward blame. And they enable you to be co-dependent instead of healing.

What if you enacted heathy boundaries by disengaging? That's the kindest thing you can do for her. It's what may actually motivate her to change or just find a new ""parent"". I know the pull for you is strong, it's an addiction. It's like you're in a cult and she's the leader. It's very hard to see reality and get out. The time and energy you spend on her just strengthens your indoctrination. But time away from her not spent thinking about her will help you ""see"" reality and break the cult leader- victim bond.",GirlDwight,False,1710887026.0
1biacdn,"Here is my reply to both of your last posts:

I don't want to be in a parental role.

For reasons I'm not gonna get into, I don't have many people and have difficulty getting close with most. I do like her as a person and unless I'm completely off in my assessment of her mirroring capabilities (which I think are mediocre), I think she's a good person. And also good at promoting my growth and I hope I am decent at promoting hers.

I don't base my self worth at all based upon others. It's been very internal to me for a while.

Sacrificing myself: there is an amount of myself I'm happy to give in any friendship/relationship, she does push boundaries but we're not going to live together this time. And I've learned a good bit about my limitations, boundaries, and we're not getting close to those limitations this time. I've also learned alot about her. I pushed so many of her buttons without even realizing. I pushed them alot. Hell I would push a normal persons buttons unknowingly in the past. It's good to have discovered and lock down my boundaries as it pertains with her. I don't think she'll push too aggressively. She'll be upset but I fully expect her to be ok with them. Or move on.

Codependent? A bit.

I'm not letting her become my life this time. And also making an active effort to build a full life.

Her boundaries, yes I will honor them. Considering everything that went on the past few months, I am impressed she managed to push through and do the right thing. Considering how much it ate away at her. I'm gonna make my peace with her and then I'm leaving her be. Ball is in her court. I'm not gonna BS her. But I do expect her to bite.

She's wanted to change since before she met me, she doesn't quite understand what's going on. She used to believe she was a narcissistic and doomed and did pursue therapy for that and made me aware of it in the beginning. I let her know a few months back that I didn't believe she wasn't one and that there is alot of hope for her. The happiness on her face was priceless. I shared info about DBT w/ her and there was an overwhelming fear on her face. She primarily attends therapy when it allows her to continue assuming the victim role. But I have seen her take responsibility and direct feedback, from me and therapist. I think DBT and the right therapist can make a big impact. 

The ball is going to be in her court entirely, she will have to take responsibility but I will be there for her in a few couples sessions just to make sure the therapist isn't being a dick to her. After she's gotten off the ground, and her personal therapist is in sync. I'm planning to step away from it. If she wants me to come for sessions here and there I will.

I'm not nearly as attached to her as most people become w/ their pwBPD. She didn't destroy my self esteem or worth. Mine is pretty concrete.

But as someone who’s been doing intermittent fasting (but i’m not the best at it so definitely search more things up) here’s what I’ve learned:

• don’t eat sugar as the last thing you eat, it’ll make it hungry 
• give yourself some time, the first few days are the hardest . Usually takes me at least 4 days 
• try to find a schedule that u can stick to, find that consistency again within this new routine
• eat more nutritious foods, protein and things like that than empty calories cuz those burn faster
• remember why you’re doing it and let that bring you peace. For me, it’s weight loss and me knowing it’ll pay off. I’m sure you can find that within religious reasons too (it’ll pay off, Allah’s with me, I have Allah’s help in this and i’m more connected with him now, so I choose peace, I choose mindfulness, I choose me and other people’s well being in his name and protection — there u go) 
• have your day filled with high “seratonin” activities than high “dopamine.” Whenever i’m just watching netflix or playing games I my phone, next thing I crave is some food. Dopamine hits just bring more dopamine cravings. So do things that bring you fulfillment— spend time w friends, family, contribute to a cause (idk help at the masque w Iftar prep and things like that.) doing things like this, you won’t feel hungry bc there’s another mechanism in play.
• have other things consistent and on plan too. So you still feel “on-plan” than out of it. 
• take it easy, acknowledge that your energy level and mental capacity might be lower. Try not to engage in fights, don’t answer or send risky messages, take lighter weight commitments, and also maybe give ppl around u a heads up that u might be more sensitive than usual these days. Use your DBT skills like “STOP,” etc. 
• listen to your body and mind and be lenient and open-minded towards how it responds so you can learn more about it and its responses, so for the days after the transition phase, you can have an easier time and apply things u learned about it. Things I said is whta i learned by being lenient and listening to my body, yours might require different things!
• idk if there’s a way to hydrate well without drinking water? Look into that, maybe a way to increase electrolytes and etc. cuz a lot of the fatigue or moodiness can also be dehydration. If there isn’t anyth on the internet, i guess just drink a lot when ur not fasting (but not tooooo much ofc)

This is actually very good, ""what has been seen can't be unseen""...
Meaning this is the base of the drive force for the rest of your therapy ""who am I really ???""
In the beginning with our tendency of black and white thinking we do think ""shit I am just an empty shell!""

We aren't, we DO have a personality outside ofour disorder,  it's just more difficult for us to get in touch with it as we reject so much of ourselves gladly, labeling it not ok.

For instance, before BPD I am also a person of feelings.  I understand the world through feelings,not mental analysis.
I can reject my feelings as ""BPD"" but ""BPD"" just impairs the way I am expressing these.
Then I am creative,  I express myself through creation.
I like gardening and calm, walking in nature.

I am still exploring ""who"" I am and, I suspect it will take time.

But the good thing I'd, you're not just a collection of coping mechanisms and the time you will take to discover yourself it more enjoyable than the ride to discover you've got an issue.

It's almost just uphill from there.

1be2buj,"Hey! I am queer, and didn't even realise it until COVID hit! I had just turned 23. 

Growing up, everyone always asked me if I was gay, and my answer was always ""I wish!"" - I also created a character, a sexy, cool girl who ""hated men"" but also craved their validation. I wasn't attractive unless men gave me attention. I would have sex with them and feel nothing. 

I have very little memories of my life, probably because I was in such a dissociated freeze state; my brain was working so hard to survive that anything beyond that was too much. 

I understand what you mean about watching people when they got changed, I obviously didn't leer, but I did find myself peeking, and later on in my teens, when my friends and I would get changed in front of each other without abandon, I would find myself in awe of their bodies. I convinced myself it was normal to find women beautiful, because they objectively are! 

Because I wasn't overly attracted to feminine women (bar a few slim exceptions), I would convince myself that I couldn't actually be gay. My friends used to come to me on nights out to kiss me and make their boyfriends jealous. It was always a point of pride for me, but I can't remember how I felt about it. I kept doing it, so probably pretty good lol. 

EDIT: I also remember going out the year before college to a club in a nearby city, and two masculine lesbian friends started ""playfully"" fighting each other over me. I remember being attracted to them (one more than the other), but then feeling so uncomfortable - even when we started kissing. Looking back on it, it was because they were so in control, which made me feel like I had ZERO control or choice. That's icky, whether you're attracted to someone or not. (Also, plot twist, I'm a top that definitely leans more dominant, so being treated like a dainty little girl being fought over by two dominant lesbians did NOTHING for me). That incident set me back another few years, because how could I be gay if I didn't enjoy it?

So it took me until COVID, when I was stuck at home and had no other option but to sit with myself and learn to entertain myself that I started to realise things (shout-out to Masc lesbian Tiktok, you're the real MVP). 

A few years later, I got diagnosed with ADHD and BPD whilst in my first long term queer relationship. They had come out as a lesbian at 13!

1bdpsdv,"Thank you so much for sharing!!! I have the same mindset and adopting this way of thinking was completely necessary for my healing.

For a long time, I struggled to honestly tell someone ""okay, this was some my bad, and some your bad."" That didn't even exist to me.

i also have the blessing of having a very close friend with BPD (you don't think it'd be a good match lol, but she is amazing) that is able to recognize when i'm getting overstimulated or starting to think/act in a distorted way. obv i can't rely on this person, but i can learn from them, and i have learned a LOT about what is ""healthy"" behavior.

1bdpsdv,"I love this question!!! it reminds me that i've made some really good progress on this front lol. a lot of it for me is having the proper support system that is very honest with me when I hurt their feelings or have a certain behavior that's harmful; I know it's not easy to find people like these, though. I got really lucky in that regard and I make sure to have honest discussions with them.

Given that ""find cool people that care about you"" is a lot easier said than done, here's some other things I do.

- Learn where my behaviors come from. I don't try to go too far into this, just a ""I am constantly afraid of losing my friends as an adult, because of switching schools as a kid, I felt like I never had any permanent friends."" This doesn't excuse the behavior, but it does give me a lot of important insight on what's going on in my brain when I'm triggered, and through that awareness I'm able to bring myself away from that thought.

- ASK FOR HELP. I realized that I, and many other people with BPD, end up splitting on someone and not taking responsibility when their needs don't feel met. That's valid, but it's again, not a reason to hurt someone- even if it's unintentional. As soon as I notice that I'm getting overstimulated more often, starting to hold resentment towards someone, engaging in unhealthy coping skills - it's time to start thinking about asking someone for a conversation, a fun day out, or just a couple check-in texts a week to make sure I'm okay. This, in turn, makes me a lot more comfortable to turn around and start noticing my behavior when I begin to feel better. It's up to me, then, to apologize for how I acted in a BPD episode.

- Remember that your perspective ≠ the other. By this I mean, if someone feels hurt by you, it's 1. not your decision if they actually were hurt (I used to avoid responsibility by saying ""I don't know how that would've hurt your feelings,"") and 2. not due to your FEELINGS towards this person. It's not because you're struggling, it's not because you feel abandoned, it's because of your behavior.

I would find myself in a lot of scenarios where I ""did X because I was feeling Y,"" when in fact my feelings shouldn't have influenced my behavior. My feelings deserve to be nurtured and listened to, not taken out on others. And that leads me to:

- Listen to your brain and body! I'm learning that if my brain feels like I've upset somebody, I'm probably not far off; likewise, if my body feels uncomfortable around somebody, maybe it's time to talk to them about something we've been having difficulties with in our friendship, before it becomes a problem for my BPD. I try to stay one step ahead of myself, because I rarely catch a BPD behavior or thought distortion as it happens. I only notice after the fact.

Basically, a lot of it for me has been prevention. If I have the ability to 1. notice my mistake, 2. apologize for it, and 3. rectify it, then I'm happy. I definitely spend many days asking my friends, ""did I do something wrong?"" ""was that mean?"" ""do I sound borderline right now?""

1bd5dm7,"It can be a boundary for you to want them to check in. Sometimes their needs might conflict with yours - that’s where the relationship-ing comes in, weighing your needs and desires vs. theirs, deciding what really matters to you in the long run, sacrificing some comfort for the sake of the relationship (hopefully on both sides).

My partner is the space-needer, I’m not. But when he goes away and is doing something that causes me a lot of anxiety - I will tell him ahead of time, and set a boundary: please check in with me at lunch and before dinner, it means a lot to me and will do so much to set me at ease. You don’t have to explicitly out-loud say: or else!!

But in your mind? Maybe. 

Seriously, is it important to have a partner who can be understanding of what you struggle with and who is willing to meet you halfway? Yes.

In those situations I personally am also giving up a lot of my comfort because I am at home usually going hard on my distress tolerance skills, doing my work to practice emotionally regulating and staying calm. I’m constantly fighting scary thoughts as they come up, constantly dealing with the trigger over and over, struggling to do work, struggling to stay distracted from the thoughts. The least he can do is make a point to stay in touch with me and be there for me as much as he can while I do my best to give him space.

It’s ok for you to say: I want a partner who knows what I struggle with and is willing to support me while I get my BPD under control. I need you to check in with me. It’s also totally valid for you to question if this is the right person for you….

Also - space after fights is a different beast: It feels like the world is going to end and everything is terrifying so often those of us with BOD crave more connection and lots of reassurance as our fears rear up - but when we put the fear down it slowly loses its power which allows our logical brain to come back online. 

Space helps in these instances even though we crave connection and closeness. It’s confusing - but the space enables the connection and closeness. Think of it like holding a balloon underwater. If you keep shoving the balloon underwater it keeps popping up more and more. But if you shove it down deeper the air starts to compress and the weight above the balloon increases and the balloon will literally shrink. Eventually you’ll get to a point where you have a withered little balloon under like 50 feet of water - and it’s much easier to deal with then. It feels like we aren’t honoring our feelings because we are “shoving them down”. But it’s not truly shoving it down. If you recognize the fear is there and that it isn’t helping the situation / you have to ignore it until it deflates a bit and you can handle the situation better.

Does that make sense? An argument on the space side and on the non-space side. There is room in relationships for needing both space and closeness at different times.

Also sorry: one last thing: remember that a boundary-less love is not a healthy one. We don’t want boundaries, but that doesn’t mean what we want is healthy or correct. If we are looking for a HEALTHY relationship, then the goal is equal space and connection. If you change you inner goal from: “have the relationship I desire”, to “have a healthy relationship”, you may find that your idea of your ideal relationship will change.",Astrnougat,False,1710277939.0

One thing to consider though is that boundaries can be for others, but they’re also for ourselves. And sometimes that may look like or be “boundaries we’re working on for ourselves that help respect the boundaries for other people”, but ultimately I think they’re also beneficial for sufferers of bpd that want to be able to manage their symptoms. Like, I want to not bother people too much via text or other communications (so I don’t overwhelm them, sure, but more importantly for me so I don’t lose them through overwhelming them), but I want to talk to them/ connect, so I’ll make sure I’m cognizant of how often I text a day/week and then set the boundaries for me that way also by leaving things in their hands of replying.

It’s something I’ve spent years learning and it’s not a skill that can be explained quickly. So it’s either:

1.) type out a 20-min reply to someone…(which I’ll happily do if I’m super bored haha)….or…


2.) realize this person needs a therapist and to go through DBT and that my response won’t be enough to change years of behavioral patterns and thinking unless they are ready to tackle their problems head on for months/years at a time, in which case I can’t help much tbh. Or…

I think part of that unrecoverable idea is that, like... I don't know how to put it, but it's like, when whatever state you're in right now feels permanent, that illusion is *so* overwhelming. Like, the entire idea of recovery goes against the way that BPD emotion states function. For me at least, it was legitimately like amnesia - like, when I was sad, I just straight up could not remember a single time that I didn't feel that way. Like, I could remember and be overwhelmed by other times I felt sad, but anything else was gone.

That perception doesn't mean recovery doesn't exist - it's an illusion created by the disorder - but it's hard to break free from.

I sympathize, on some level, with people who are in that cycle right now and don't think it can ever get better. That's part of the disorder.

- Saying""I'm upset because you took an hour to respond to my text"" expresses a feeling PLUS expressing a *thought* that assigns blame for the feeling.

**Feelings are always valid but  thoughts about feelings can be completely invalid.** 

In the above example the feeling is real and can be validated, but the reasoning for the feeling is probably invalid. Most people don't get upset at a one-hour wait for a text response..

1bbdsr0,"I was diagnosed with both. I was diagnosed with BPD as a teenager, but every mental health professional I saw didn’t point out my ADHD. I moved and I was misdiagnosed with bipolar (that’s a whole other story) and I was also diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety

I found a really good psych and therapist 2 years ago and I’m “properly” diagnosed with BPD, C-PTSD (no longer meet criteria now for both), ADHD-combined type, and OCD.

ADHD symptoms and BPD symptoms overlap a lot. It’s not in the official diagnostic criteria, but people who have ADHD struggle with low frustration tolerance (low ability to manage anger) and effectively regulate emotions. People who have ADHD can also experience more moment-to-moment mood changes, which can also look like BPD. Among the poor impulse control which is also a BPD symptom.

How to differentiate? 
-BPD experiences instability in sense of self, lack of knowing who they are
-severe abandonment issues
-experience transient dissociation/paranoid ideation 

So they can kinda mesh with eachother. I’ve always had a hard time managing my emotions, on stimulant meds I can manage my emotions- ESPECIALLY anger- much better. My mood is also more level during the day. I’m less scattered, more patient. Meds have made my ability to function so much better. I can participate more in therapy, regulate my impulses, I’m more calm during the day. 

The biggest role meds have in treating BPD is treating co-occurring disorders to lower distress, so that the BPD sufferer can further use skills to regulate themselves. I’ve found this to be very true with my adhd meds and my ability to regulate my other BPD  symptoms. 

ADHD is a self-regulation disorder, and in my opinion, I think “ADHD” is a terrible name. It should be executive dysfunction disorder.

I will say however, as a woman, I've realized that if I'm under more stress, or if certain hormone levels are higher for me at certain times of the month, stimulant meds can either make symptoms way worse, or they just don't make a difference at all.

My therapist often ask me for a pause to think, or to breathe, during our sessions.

Actually, he explained to me that he want to make sure he respond in a way that will help me and is therapeutically sound. Also, sometimes, I think he just need a time to manage his own emotions. The stuff I talk about may trigger his own stuff, we don't know the traumas and experiences of our therapists.

I think this is a sign of a serious therapist, who tries to be the best help they can and not be simply in ""reaction mode"". 

As for the ""I'm winning at therapy"" joke and her reaction… I often joke in tense moments in therapy. A interesting question is ""why"" ? Talking about it, my therapist told me that he's careful to not encourage it, as it divert attention from the unpleasant stuff that caused the tense moment. The unpleasant stuff is where we do work.

So, my message is : there are other, more positive, ways to see what happened.

If not, I hope you're at least housed and fed and I suggest you take it one day at a time. Break down how much you owe, however much you can spare each month, and just focus on not making the debt any bigger. When you have debt it can sometimes be like 'well there's 6k on this card so what's $500 more?' Then that'll turn into another $200 of interest you're paying off (if that applies).

I have only recently really feel I'm ok, after two years of no splits or overwhelming negativity feelings.

1b9yxxt,"Yes. If you MAKE it better.

It took me a year of DBT, then four months of Schema therapy (because you don't do trauma therapy before you can regulate your shit lol), concurrent with individual therapy. It took actively working the skills especially when it was easy so it'd come more naturally when things were hard. I've learned I can't drink anymore, can't fuck around anymore, and had to clean out a lot of unhealthy people in my life. There are environments I don't spend time in and I figured what works best for me (not for everyone, for me) -- a small, quiet life with few close friends and a family who loves and supports me. I'm connected with my communities, I'm involved with my family. I'm whole.

Am I always happy? No, of course not, because happy is an emotion and emotions are fleeting, but I AM content and that's such a blessing. I'm deeply grateful for the life I have, for everything I have.

Remember that this is about literally changing how your brain works. Changing your behaviour changes your brain but it means that in EVERY instance you have to do the new behaviours, not just when it's easy or suits you. This isn't about tolerating distress because all of life is about tolerating distress, it's about doing it effectively without hurting yourself OR other people. 

Life is hard and it'll never stop being hard.

The gold standard care for bpd is DBT. dialectical (something being two things at once...example: i love him, but he's upset me), so it's dialectical behavioral therapy. 


Its like cbt, but with western ideologies. Like mindfulness (being aware of feelingsh emotions-reality), meditation (and things like the DIVE effect... when you ground yourself in stressful situationsh you practice 4x a day until it's second nature, so when you get triggered you can remember how to cope), staying in what we call ""wisemind"" instead of ""rational-mind"" or in ""emotional-mind."" Staying in this 5 minutes (instead of in the past-where i usually find shame, or in the future-where i usually feel helpless and anxious. 




Now i take lexapro (ssri approved for anxiety as will as depression), a mood stabilizer-vrylar, and valium (long acting benzo to present panic attacks and basically sedate my overacting, over talking and over active mind. 


Realizing i need boundaries, to accept others boundaries, and i wanted to say that i set alarms for mt valium 3x a day. I call it the ""gratitde/h.a.u.l.t"" alarm. I open my notes on phone, type something meaningful i'm grateful for, and i assess myself with h.a.u.l.t. hungry? Angery? Upset? Lonley?

Another reason why i got better is bc of my therapist helping me break through certain realizations that i never thought would be true. I genuinely thank this woman from the bottom of my heart for helping me. She helped me realize where did my fear of abandonment comes from. She helped me find the grey area in situations where I could only see the bad in(or the good)(black and white thinking). And since then I can say that my life has gotten a little less chaotic. I still get episodes and I still split a lot but not at the same intensity and has much as I did as a child or when I was a younger teenager.

1b9yxxt,"DSM-V criteria for OCD; THEN BPD
Specific Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Criteria

The physician or mental health professional will determine whether you meet the specific obsessive-compulsive disorder criteria listed in the DSM-5, during the psychological evaluation portion of your visit. Your symptoms must meet both the general and specific characteristics of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

To receive an OCD diagnosis, you must meet these general criteria:

You must have obsessions and compulsions
The obsessions and compulsions must significantly impact your daily life
You may or may not realize that your obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable

Your obsessions must meet specific criteria:

Intrusive, repetitive and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that cause distress
The thoughts do not just excessively focus on real problems in your life
You unsuccessfully try to suppress or ignore the disturbing thoughts, urges, or images
You may or may not know that your mind simply generates these thoughts and that they do not pose a true threat

Your compulsions must meet specific criteria:

Excessive and repetitive ritualistic behavior that you feel you must perform, or something bad will happen. Examples include hand washing, counting, silent mental rituals, checking door locks, etc.
The ritualistic compulsions take up a least one hour or more per day
You perform these physical rituals or mental acts to reduce the severe anxiety caused by the obsessive thoughts.





The Borderline pattern specifier may be applied to individuals whose pattern of personality disturbance is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:

Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment.
A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, which may be characterized by vacillations between idealization and devaluation, typically associated with both strong desire for and fear of closeness and intimacy.
Identity disturbance, manifested in markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.
A tendency to act rashly in states of high negative affect, leading to potentially self-damaging behaviours (e.g., risky sexual behaviour, reckless driving, excessive alcohol or substance use, binge eating).
Recurrent episodes of self-harm (e.g., suicide attempts or gestures, self-mutilation).
Emotional instability due to marked reactivity of mood. Fluctuations of mood may be triggered either internally (e.g., by one’s own thoughts) or by external events. As a consequence, the individual experiences intense dysphoric mood states, which typically last for a few hours but may last for up to several days.
Chronic feelings of emptiness.
Inappropriate intense anger or difficulty controlling anger manifested in frequent displays of temper (e.g., yelling or screaming, throwing or breaking things, getting into physical fights).
Transient dissociative symptoms or psychotic-like features (e.g., brief hallucinations, paranoia) in situations of high affective arousal.

Other manifestations of Borderline pattern, not all of which may be present in a given individual at a given time, include the following:

A view of the self as inadequate, bad, guilty, disgusting, and contemptible.
An experience of the self as profoundly different and isolated from other people; a painful sense of alienation and pervasive loneliness.
Proneness to rejection hypersensitivity; problems in establishing and maintaining consistent and appropriate levels of trust in interpersonal relationships; frequent misinterpretation of social signals",Born-Value-779,False,1710555687.0
1b9yxxt,"i would like to at times think other things are the root of my problems than BPD, add it's so serious and pervasive. I believe that my percieved abandonment, and swells esteem issues relay onto my relationship. Inevitability of us having hard interpersonal relationships it's going to follow HEAVY bc of this. Does you ocd effect other parts of your life? Do you feel like the rocd is in more than romantic relationships. We do have a much talked about favorite persosituation to think of too. I have a VERY affirming partner who understands my triggers and does EVERYTHING possible to eliminate them, as well as reassure me... does your partner do this? I want what's best for us and we need the reassurance with real trains why we matter and are different and worth the extra effort
 


I also believe having r-ocd doesn't just come out of nowhere from what i've been reading. Out seems to be relsted to ptsd? 


Do you associate with 5/9 of the bpd? 
Icouldn't find dsm-v criteria on r-ocd... i couldn't find it quickly, doesn't mean it isn't there tho. 


What are you thinning?


Do you radically accept your bpd? Or that you have traits? 
-radical acceptance: accepting it as fact, NOT LIKING IT, not wanting it to be, but simply accepting.

1b87a97,"first of all, it can get better. i was diagnosed 6 years ago i was fully a mess. codependent with friends and partners, self harming, drinking compulsively, using hard drugs, etc etc. i still experience some uncomfortable symptoms to this day, but my behaviors have changed. i am sober, i am free from self harm, i am grounded, i am happy, and i have stable relationships. 

theres no easy, one size fits all answer. DBT helps a lot of us. it is the gold standard of treating BPD professionally, from what i understand. it didnt work super well for me, but i am in the minority. it is usually quite effective. if you have access to this sort of treatment, i recommend it. it is an intensive program though, be prepared for it to take up a lot of your time and energy.

you cannot medicate BPD directly from what i understand. but some of the symptoms can be dampened a little, and treating any comorbid mental diagnosis u may have (like adhd, depression, panic, ptsd, bipolar etc) will help manage the BPD symptoms a LOT. 

for me as an individual, religious practice is the most helpful modality of recovery i have ever found in dealing with my “symptoms”. religion/spirituality has the potential to be very helpful, but it also has the potential to cause harm so we should all be aware that it can be a risk. 

meditation in particular can get the heart BPD type thought patterns. im speaking of both the newer internet wave of pop-psychology guided meditations (mindfulness meditation apps, youtube meditations etc) and the more traditional modes of meditation (like transcendental mediation, loving kindness meditation). the whole spectrum of meditation has the potential to help in very direct ways. the good thing about meditation is it would be more or less risk free in comparison to other religious/spiritual practices. i rarely hear stories of meditation teachers abusing students, and even then you don’t necessarily NEED a teacher at all with the abundance of free internet resources. you could realistically just do it by yourself. no money investment, and very minimal time investment (even 15 minutes a day is huge). it seems like a really safe bet compared to joining a church or mosque or any other type of congregation. 

that being said, the community aspect was huge for my BPD recovery personally as a Catholic; sometimes congregational practices can be worth the risk. it helped me build healthy social connections with firm boundaries. it helped me work through my issues in attachment and abandonment, and it helped me develop a very firm sense of self i never had before. all this in addition to progress in my spiritual formation via prayer, the sacraments, service etc. but as im sure everyone knows, there are serious risks! tragically, religious congregations are too often breeding grounds for bigotry, reactionary politics, exploitation, grooming, spiritual abuse, abuse in general, etc etc etc. if you try the religious route, id recommend being cautious, and treating anyone who makes demands of you with suspicion. 
 
you didnt give much information about your experience in your post, so i cannot offer anything more tailored to your specific needs, but i hope my perspective as someone with BPD who has made a significant amount of progress in recovery is a bit helpful. feel free to dm me if you would like to talk. good luck!",Dorfdarb1,False,1709761536.0

It's not really a good example as I was thrown around with different diagnosis for a long time.

BPD came later on.

All in all it's not really the time invested it's the proper therapy type and therapist that counts.

EMDR and schema therapy is what really makes a difference.

I wish EMDR solved all, it really helped with minimizing the triggers though and saved my life at the time.

When it comes to real results with personality disorder, schema therapy hands down.

It helped me recognize my own dynamics, ""who"" was talking in my head and therefore be able to apply the proper strategy when I feel an episode coming.

It improved my life greatly although I am still BPD (even though my therapist would say that I do not really meet the criteria anymore, they classified it as ""mild"")

My youth was a wreck train. I remember the excruciating pain that brought ANY relationship.
To avoid the pain I even went to a cult , without much success aside of extra trauma.

I still feel more than a neurotypical person.
My emotional response is still faster and higher than others.

I learn now how to deal with that without blaming myself or retreating. 

My life is now 10000x better than it used to be. I have normal relationships,  no extreme outburst anymore. Still not easy to live around but I am still very caring and loving.
I do not ruminate as much and I am able to tell myself ""well we'll see tomorrow hoe we feel about that"".

Maybe it's just old age and the fact that I know I can't  trust high emotions.
They always have a point, but I am always overreacting when I start to want ""justice"".

I am more mellow in many areas of my life, my work, my friends.
I still have issues with romantic relationships and still have to find a stable partner (meaning by that emotionally stable) as I always chose partners that would eventually let me down (meaning that there were clear signs of incompatibility that we didn't listen)

I came to realize almost all my friends were manipulative people who could sense how insecure I was and used it to their advantage which sucks.

I am about 5 years out of that, and I have retained a couple great friends who were there for me and have encouraged my healing.

That ""oh, shit...you're a cunt!"" realisation is one I've had more than once.

It's a plus and a minus. It's great that you're more aware of yourself and others, and it's such a blessing to be well enough to have the energy to make those realisations, y'know? But it also means that those who've been on the trip with you so far might not be the right ones to keep walking with you....and that's alright. 

Get more into chess and hiking. There are clubs for both those activities an that's ALWAYS worth checking out. It doesn't mean your bestie can't still be in your life but they don't have to do every single little thing with you -- you have other interests and you're allowed to. She doesn't have to play chess, either, it just means that's not something you do together, but you have lots of other things to do. 

There are so, so many other people out there who you'd fit very well with but you need to be brave enough to take those first steps.

Thankfully, the program happens to be set up in a way where I can pick groups/classes by different facilitators. 

More generally, meeting people who are stuck in a perception of you in general is annoying, at the very least. One has to sorta build an internal shield to deal with them, otherwise their projections can be harmful (delay or push back recovery, e.g.). This is basically boundary work. People without mental health disorders also have to deal with this, tbh. Boundary work is something every human has to work with, although for some it can come easier on average. Boundaries are also about holding frame vs people who project on you, or have a skewed perception of you, or an old perception of you. It's even about dealing with internal parts of ourselves that have outdated perception of ourselves (see Internal Family Systems, a therapeutic model).",SpiritualCyberpunk,False,1709280018.0

1b351sw,"Okay, let’s take a breath. A deep one. 

Your post looks frantic and I’m sure that’s how you mind feels right now. 

What I’m going to say will be harsh, but I think you need this. And it’s all said with love and understanding. /gen

Now, let’s break it down in bits. 

“Something happened recently where my friend told me I was being mean to her and I get I was being mean. I was very overstimulated and annoyed (I’m also diagnosed ADHD) at everyone so I think I started taking it out on her.”

Okay, that’s good! 

You acknowledged that you were being mean and acknowledged that despite feeling overstimulated, that was still wrong of you to take it out on her. 

Let’s keep going.

“And then she went on to tell me that I’m never there for her and that I need serious help with my friendships because I hurt her and etc because I wouldn’t apologise to her when she told me that she was hurt. 

I just kept on trying to defend myself and not take accountability for what I did. And I love her a lot she’s a good friend of mine but I don’t think she understands what my issue is but I also don’t think it would make sense to use that as an excuse.”

Now right there, you say that you “don’t think it would make sense to use that as an excuse”. 

There is no finding an excuse. You have said and acknowledged that you are not being a good friend to them. (ie. Being mean and won’t apologize)

She, as your friend, should try to understand your feelings and situation. 

***However***, you haven’t been doing the same. You are asking her to understand your POV without willing to even budge on doing it yourself, ***NATURALLY***. (Or in other words, you don’t have to stop splitting to apologize.)

“She also lives in the same area as I do so it’s kinda hard to avoid her, I just blocked her from social media because I don’t think I want to be friends with her at this current moment especially when I am annoyed and I don’t like being around her.”

Point blank, that was wrong of you to do. Even if you don’t see it in this way, you’re essentially saying “I’m mad at you so I’m going to pretend you don’t exist.”

What if someone else or specifically, your friend, did that to you? You would feel horrible. You would feel used. Because that’s what you’re doing. You will have them for emotional comfort then block them if you’re mad. 

That is **not** okay. And that is not what friends do to each other.

“My other friend is also mad at me because of this situation and it really sucks because she wasn’t involved in the first place but the friend I had a problem with went and told her about it and then I went on a tangent saying that they are sitting around and talking shit about me and they all hate me and don’t wanna be friends with me.”

Your other friend is mad for good reason. If you saw your friend was being treated bad by another mutual friend or even a stranger, you’d be upset. 

You are assuming they hate you. Criticism is not hate. Telling someone to take accountability is not hate. 

How you’re acting can definitely come off though as you hate **them**, not the other way around.

“I just feel so alone and I don’t know what to do.”

First, you need to take time to yourself to think. 

Write or type up a letter about how you feel. Allow yourself that.

Second, if you truly love your friends, you need to **unblock them**, **explain everything that you just told us**, and **APOLOGIZE**.

I’ll be honest though OP, with everything you’re saying, do not expect things to go back to normal.

You aren’t owed forgiveness and you need to remember that.

I took the time to do this because I hear you, truly. You have an illness, just like all of us. 

You do not deserve to be alone and unloved because of it. 

But you need to do better. Not just for them, but for yourself.

You’re in my prayers OP. God speed.

For example, are you afraid to feel attached - if so, why? Are you afraid to feel emotional intensity - if so, are there specific emotions that feel intense?

I can relate to some of what you're feeling. I went through a pretty intense betrayal from a person I was close to about a year ago and since then I've really struggled to feel connected to anyone. I feel like if any of my remaining relationships were to end I would feel nothing.

take baby steps, spend time with yourself, understand your needs, your unhealed wounds, dig deeper into what your fears and lacks are which you're trying to get him to compensate for and fill in, FOR you. then you self-soothe, practice self-love and learn to regulate yourself without letting your unhealthy thought process get the best of you. once you start giving yourself what you need from others, you'll become more dependant on yourself and trust yourself. 
engage in your hobbies, learn a new skill, read a book, spend time with yourself, do daily affirmations, excercise- even a 30 minute walk everyday is okay, invest in yourself, practice mindfulness through meditation and journaling. you see, where focus goes, energy flows. when you focus on yourself and de-centre him, instead of being hypervigilant of and fixated on him and losing yourself in the process, you'll be fine. learn to enjoy your own company and as long as you're not abandoning yourself, you'll be fine. you need to seperate your own personal life and routine from him. he's just an embellshment, not a part of your identity. live and act like that and with time and consistency, you'll adopt this mindset. remember, you are not your disorder and don't let it's distorted lens of viewing things be your reality:)

a crucial part is also to look at the situation from a 3rd person scenario and not personally, guided by your dysregulated emotions rather than logic and rationale. also, communicate. sit with him and have one long discussion. open up about your issues and assure him that you re working on them and while you'll make sure that it doesn't become a  burden on him, he could reassure you from time to time. you deserve that. no one is perfect and everyone has issues. as long as you're doing your best working on them and trying to get better, your partner should be cheering you on and understanding you in the process. mutual understanding and compromise is the basis of a relationship.

1aymey0,"I am a hundred different people. All of them are me, and none of them are me.

Identity disturbance was once my most prevalent and painful symptom. It took me years to find my identity. But I did.

One of the first things I did was open up a notepad on my phone and write down the things that I truly liked or didn't like. I literally started with things like:

I don't like tomatoes.

I like wearing black clothes.

I like punk music.

I don't like overhead lights in the morning.

I like flowers.

I like to grow houseplants.

I need a lot of time alone.

I like when people are honest, even if it hurts.

I don't like wearing lipstick, but I like lip gloss.

I listed any dumbass thing I could think of that I KNEW was my own preference, no matter how stupid it felt at the time. I started small and I began to notice the things that I truly valued over time.

I curated this list over YEARS. It's okay if my values or likes/dislikes changed. I just updated the list. But I didn't add anything unless I was 100% sure it was coming from my true self - not outside influences.

It was hard at first. But over time I began to gain a sense of who I really was. And when I felt lost, I would read the list to remind myself.

I also cultivated my own style, which was very difficult. I used to change almost daily. I even wore wigs so I could change my looks on a whim. One day I would be punk rock. One day I would be a hippie. One day I would be glamorous or preppy. Every fucking day I was someone different, and it was so hard to live with.

So I started to just meditate and think about what I really liked if there was no one else in my life but me. If I could just exist in a perfect world with no one influencing me, who would I really want to be? This was difficult, but eventually I began to understand myself.

If a thought popped into my head like, ""I like the color purple."" I would analyze it to death, trying to determine if it was real or something I just adopted for other reasons (to fit in, impress other people, be liked, etc.)

There really is no other answer besides just being determined to find who you really are - pulling your real self out of the chaos of your thoughts, outside influences, and the confusion. It is not easy. But you are in there and you have an identity. You are beautiful and unique. You can find yourself.",hairspray_heart,False,1708758927.0

1aymey0,"Yes!! I also find identity disturbance to be one of the main manifestations of my BPD. I did this list making not with preferences, but with my VALUES! For example,

I value being honest with myself and others

I value making all situations as consensual as possible

I value self expression, I like that I'm okay walking to my own drum beat

I value creativity, I enjoy creativity from others and try to embrace my own opportunities to be creative

Looking at these kinds of values makes me feel much more centered in who I am, and how I am moving thru the world. I like to pause and reflect on my actions, and see where I can make adjustments to make my actions more aligned with these values. For example, am I denying myself chances to be creative because I'm too ashamed to let myself be bad at art? Fix it; it's okay to be bad at art, I value the chance to be creative and let my creativity flow, even if it's not going to end up in a museum. Next time, I will help myself follow my values by letting creativity flow!

I recently went to a store with my boyfriend, and to make a long story short as he left I noticed my boyfriend started becoming anxious. And in his process of explaining to me how he feels, he did reveal that he regretted going into the store. At one point, he very calmly said, “ I wish you had not said [blank]”. 

In the moment, I really wanted to defend myself. I felt like it was unfair for him to say such a thing. And I thought to myself, I have definitely been in situations where I have been anxious and maybe not super fair to my partner. In those moments, I’m so focused on myself, and what I just experienced, I don’t even realize the gravity of what Im saying until after the fact. In those moments, I would really appreciate being given the space and permission to feel my feelings, and then reassess. 

So what I decided to do in that moment is tell myself that how he feels about the interaction in the store is none of my business. Therefore it’s not my situation to fix. I’m gonna allow him to be anxious and ride that wave. I’m not gonna try to stop him or over defend myself, I’m just gonna do exactly what is polite and end my participation in the interaction.

So I said, “I was doing my best to be polite, I can see you wished things turned out differently. I’m sorry and now I know how that makes you feel” 

Guess what happened? Nothing! I was amazed. He basically just self regulated during our walk. No argument. No hyper vigilance. He brought it up again and never blamed me, he even apologized for doing so and recognized he put us in that position to be begin with.

I think the lessons I took from this are as follows: 

1. Give people permission to be anxious or over stimulated. 

2. If they hurt your feelings in a benign way, I’m not talking about abuse. Then don’t worry about being right. They are human too and will make mistakes. Just make sure to discuss if it calmly and make sure to use “I “ statements.

3.  If you find yourself revisiting an older conflict and find yourself randomly ruminating on how you were treated. This is where your own therapy and practice comes in. For me, I would focus on what he did after the mistake to make ammends. Remind myself I make mistakes too. (Joke around with myself that making mistakes is MY thing and how dare he try to steal my personality 🙃) and I always follow with this mantra: “I am safe. I am not in trouble. We are just human” because likely, you are thinking about that past conflict because something else just triggered you. Find that trigger and disarm.

Reducing splitting episodes may be better handled by cognitive reframing skills, which you can build in therapy. Other tactics, like learning to slow down and go take a breather (as to not take it out on someone) can also make splitting more manageable. Learning to identify the feeling and calm my physical body sensations has also been helpful for me once a split has happened. 

To my knowledge, medication cannot directly reduce splitting episodes. But may stabilize your mood in other ways that make you more able to cope with splitting, especially if you are stable enough to spend therapy sessions building CBT+DBT skills.

If someone’s using crafts (or exercise or reading or cleaning or helping others or whatever else) as an escape and using it to the extent that it’s negatively affecting their personal growth and other areas of their life, then it’s no longer just a healthy coping skill/hobby/interest.",SarruhTonin,False,1708624245.0
1ax9xzy,"For me, my hobbies tend to be extremely helpful, but aren't without their detriments. I'm more of an artist than I am a crafter (I draw/write/sing/etc) and it is a very positive release of energy that also keeps my brain busy enough with something to where I'm not thinking too much (I also have OCD- this + BPD equals a LOT of thought looping that feels almost compulsive.) I love throwing on a long video essay on Youtube, or one of my favorite shows, and just drawing for hours. Same with a video game soundtrack I like or one of my playlists and writing.

Like u/ SarruhTonin said, it can have negative implications, like too much of most things. I also have autism (go figure. God really got me) + in my case, I have a problem with hyperfixating on my interests, and doing dangerous things to be able to keep enjoying said hyperfixation. for example, yesterday, I took in a super risky amount of caffeine and had nasty feelings for hours, all so I could continue writing after I ran some errands (and played some video games. Another thing I sink a fuckton of time into.)

It can harm my relationships, especially if I'm in a phase where all I want to talk about is art/whatever game I'm playing, or I'm so invested in my hobbies that other people stop existing. Definitely does a number on my body (I sit in really weird positions for far too long without stretch breaks. Chronic pain compounds with this. I also forget to eat regularly, and like I mentioned- way too much caffeine.) Sometimes, especially when the rest of the world feels really evil and scary, I use these things as escapism when I should be facing my problems despite the fear I have; they can be an avoidance tactic for me and one that I've relied on since I was really little, but I'm teaching myself now that I can't use my hobbies to run from things. They are to relax and to feel connected to myself, not to feel detached from the rest of my personal world.

I also find that having friends with the same hobbies is EXTREMELY beneficial. All of my friends are artists and I feel like it's made me more responsible? eg. when I was in college and we lived together, one of them would put away their sketchbook to get some homework done. despite wanting to keep drawing, I knew that they had the right idea. I would've never done that if I was drawing alone; I would've been there all night, my homework unfinished in the morning. It's really a matter of balance.

1awwyhv,"Phones are not good for us. I’m starting to really hate using mine. It fucks with your neurotransmitters; the instant gratification and quick, overwhelming dopamine releases are chemically similar to consistent drug usage. Dopamine is part of your internal reward system. You get it doing mundane things like dishes, finishing an assignment, or reading a book. It’s what gives us motivation, helps us stay focused, and makes us feel accomplished after completing tasks. 

When we overwhelm our brain with dopamine from drugs or screen time, it becomes a lot more difficult to become motivated, focus, complete tasks; or feel accomplished, satisfied, happy etc. It’s also why people tend to get locked in and scroll for hours without intending to, only to feel depressed & unfocused afterwards.

1awtgla,"Honestly that sounds a lot more like bipolar disorder (BP) than BPD. They do share similarities, and my best friend was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder for a year before she got her correct diagnosis of BPD. 
In bipolar disorder, people go through periods of time where their mood is lower and more depressed, and then they have periods of time where their mood and behavior is manic and erratic and they can feel ""crazy"". Those two different periods of times are called ""mania"" (the high emotions) and ""depression"" (the low emotions). Bipolar disorder is obviously more complex than that but that's a very surface level explanation. People who have BP can experience the lows and highs for months at a time, but they can also experience them for weeks at a time, sometimes even less than a week. If I'm not mistaken, I'm pretty sure experiencing highs and lows for around a week at a time is fitting to what's called ""rapid-cycling bipolar disorder"". 
I have BPD and I get those kinds of feelings but it never lasts days. Normally with my BPD, I cycle through a lot of emotions in a day and I'm never set on one emotion for days at a time. 
What you're discribing sounds a lot like a manic phase. Of course I'm not 100% sure but I definitely recommend looking it up and seeing if it matches what you're describing.",vlynn999,False,1708630195.0

what i do for when a “split” starts, is that i take a moment to think rationally. for example, “are they really as bad as im making them out to be”,  “do i really have these negative thoughts about them”, and etc. 
im not sure how to explain the second one, but ill try anyway. the second one is whether it be an argument is about to start, is current, or has passed. try ur best to think about the good things theyve done for u. 

since i dont know anything about ur situation im just gonna state the obvious, its gnna take a lot of time and effort to get through this as long as ur willing and committed to help urself.

big reminder, be consistent and be patient with urself !!

i know im not being very helpful since im not explaining good but i rlly hope u understand what im tryna say.

if ur in any type of argument, disagreement, or even just a random little thing they said to u/ did to u/ or just did that u may have disliked which mightve made u split, just please remove urself from them when u start to feel any negative thought abt them.
for example, “theyre full of sht ”, “they arent taking me seriously, they never have”,  or anything remotely similar. 

removing urself during heated moments or when ur having thoughts like this is very helpful and can allow u to get a chance of awareness. this can give u time to de-escalate and think rationally.

1aukvzu,"Hey! Borderline in remission here! 

First of all, I want to tell you that I’m VERY proud of you! Self-awareness is the first step to healing, although it is, in my opinion, the most painful part as well.

Unfortunately, these aren’t things you’re going to be able to overcome entirely on your own. You’re going to need support. Ideally, you need DBT (which was literally created with BPD in mind) and/or CBT. Personally, DBT didn’t do much for me. It just felt like I was going in circles. CBT, however, was AMAZING. I went into remission in a little under two years as opposed to the 8+ years I was in DBT. Every person with BPD is different though, so you may find that DBT does work for you. If so, that’s great! If not, don’t give up! As long as you’re trying and putting in genuine effort, you can (and will!) get better!

If you don’t have access to an “organic” therapist, there are online DBT and CBT resources. In fact, the workbooks my therapist used for me are available on Amazon (I’ll have to ask her to remind me what the names are, though). Other borderlines I’ve talked to have found printable DBT and CBT worksheets and resources on YouTube as well. Obviously a live therapist is ideal, but there are still options if you can’t afford one. 

Good luck! I’m rooting for you! And if you need someone to talk to for emotional support from someone who’s been there during your healing journey, my dm’s are always open ❤️",,False,1708351886.0

Whatever their answer is, take it at that and believe whatever they say- after all if they are not the right therapist you don't want them wasting your time 

I hope you realise that you're not exhauing; you have a challenge amd an illness and some people s hearts bleed for you. That can easily be misinterpreted but a Frank conversation should clear this up

1as21u0,"Nope. Assuming you have borderline- sounds like you just provided a classic example of it: splitting. All was well with your therapist until you perceived her as being freaked out by you. Now, you’re questioning how you acted, what you said. You feel shamed. 

The guilt is so bad that you’re coming on Reddit to talk about it (which is a GOOD thing, keep sharing your experience- that’s what these communities are about! Being vulnerable).

Have you been diagnosed with BPD?",,False,1708080558.0
1as21u0,"hi. i think it’s easy for people to give professionals the benefit of the doubt. she could’ve been listening intently and that’s all. you could be overreacting. these are real possibilities and they should help gauge your reaction moving forward.

however i do feel like it’s notable that in my own personal experience with therapists, they can pull away. not every therapist is a good one. not every therapist is equipped to handle everything. not every therapist knows how to tell when they cannot help, and frankly not every therapist cares. i have had many therapists pull away when i reveal a particularly “off-putting” symptom such as feeling like im acting in conversations, anything dpdr related, or changing rapidly, whether that be emotionally or personality wise. it is also a possibility your therapist did pull away because of the disclosure, people sometimes think it’s off-putting how fast we change. i want you to know this is often a nonissue and changing is natural, we just seem to have a faster process because of how quick we go through and process emotions. if this is what happened and your therapist pulled away, it is not your fault. you are expressing something you think was notable or important or interesting about yourself and that is exactly what you should do in therapy. if the therapist has a bad reaction to that when it is not dangerous or policy breaking, that is on the therapist. please know that not every therapist will work out and with bpd it seems we have a more difficult time finding long term good therapists due to rampant stigma and our impulses to stop therapy or change therapists. 

all this being said: i think you should try your best to let this go and continue therapy. if anything else happens, you can always find a new therapist then. i think it is most likely that she did not realize how her silence would come off to you. i think continuing therapy and trying to move past this would be a good idea. you could even bring it up in therapy if you feel a discussion would help.

1as21u0,I think you're reading too far into it. And also those Myers Briggs tests don't really mean anything so I hope you're not putting too much stock in them,delta1810,False,1708094842.0
1as21u0,"First of all, slowwww down. Just take a second. It's okay. Nobody hates you or is scared of you for having BPD, especially not a mental health professional. Regular personality shifts, of all things, are unlikely to freak a therapist out. It also sounds like there's a few BPD distortions at play here - splitting (going from liking your therapist to hating her (unless you already didn't like her,)) catastrophizing - ('she looked at me weird, she must hate me and think i'm scared of me' that is a worst case scenario. maybe she's just newer and doesn't know how to be a stone-faced therapist. maybe she has a particular interest in BPD and wants to see the way it manifests in you, etc.) and mind reading (thinking you know what she's thinking because you 'saw it on her face/in her posture.' Again, unlikely, and you don't know what's truly going through someone's head unless you ask them. I SEVERELY struggle with mind reading myself.)

all that said, just go back and be direct with her if it really bothered you that much. ""Hey, I noticed you looked a little scared but you said you were listening. Did I have any concerning behavior? Can we discuss it together?""

You can also always switch therapists. Almost nobody finds their perfect fit immediately. Would I quit this therapist over this personally? No, not at all.

Not your opinions, but your temperament. That usually doesn’t change for people. So for example makes sense that while my perception type changed, my IN stayed the same. That’s my temperament, I’m introverted intuitive. More rigid in the past and maybe as I matured I became more perceptive.

I was at this point in my life just a month ago and TRUST ME this disorder is not a final death sentence. it's been proven to me time and again. ik it is very hard to deal with your emotions because they're so big and tumultuous that it's impossible to suppress or approach them. but listen. there's a reason for EVERYTHING that you're feeling and going through okay? It's not smth u just woke up with for no reason. everything, every symptom, every upsetting thought, every disappointing thing in your life has a reason and once you find the reason you can WEED it out.

Look, I don't have access to professional help yet and I'm just trying to approach what I feel as calmly and slowly as I could and face those feelings. I've been doing everything slowly and on my own pace and to whatever extent I could, so that I can find the root cause for my feelings and be compassionate with myself. and if I can create a difference in my life like that at 16 with no help, you can too at 28.

Both of u are gonna have issues, and both needs time to express it and heal, both has to be supportive. For this to happen, there needs to be an boundary for the things that needs to be set.

One other thing to take in consideration would be understanding each other's splits and supporting them through it, and both have to be in the healing process and have to accept the support.

Understanding of each other and boundaries are the key to the relationship, which is extremely hard to achieve. And both of u have to be comfortable in this relationship, more than just the desire to not be alone.

1am4lub,"It’s not your bfs job to handle those triggers better it’s yours. 

Try communicating them differently. 

I know it sort of starts with: 
- something triggered you and you feel ashamed for feeling bad
- you are now both ashamed of yourself and embarrassed of your feeling
- you are now in the BPD lens and since you can only see how awful you are you assume the thing that triggered you is because of some unloveable quality in yourself
- your rule book is now active: I’m not loveable. If he loved me he would do this and that. He didn’t do this or that, therefore he doesn’t love me.
- you bring this up to your partner: I feel like you don’t love because you didn’t do my dishes. (Or whatever)
- they get mad because you’re “accusing” them of not loving you when they already put a ton of effort into the relationship. 

Try just changing how you phrase it:
- hey when you did that thing, what did it mean to you?
- hey I noticed you didn’t do this for me and I’m wondering why not, I’m assuming it’s because I did something wrong?
- hey my brain is telling me that when you didn’t do my dishes it’s because you think I’m a disgusting possum who you hate. Is this true?

I think the last one works the best because you still get to vent out the terrible feeling and you still get to say what you are scared of is real, but then you also don’t blame them of thinking that way and you give them the chance to respond and comfort you.

You can continue to ask for more detail

But in general - I’m glad you’re checking in somewhere. If you had a psych for 5 years and you are in this state? Get a new one. It’ll take effort but this one obviously isn’t working.

1ajo9hz,Whew yes I loved this and so needed it and yes makes so much sense. How you handled relationship anxiety is me to a tee. And it feels very much like earth exploding. He’s reassured and reassured and I’ve freaked out more and more. So - one question- do our brains think our partner is stabbing us? Because mine doesn’t always reassure or even try to be nice. We’re at a bad spot where we just keep cycling ..and cycling.. and repeat. He gets just as activated. Hence it makes me go nuts real quick.,Psych-obsessed,False,1707180018.0

I feel some meditation,  guided meditation can help.  You can get them free on utube.  I like an hour.   So say it and discuss it once.  Meditate reassurance that you are OK, lovable and honesty it will boost your confidence from the inside rather than outside.",Necessary_Mistake110,False,1707787431.0
1ajo9hz,"I think it’s more like: our brain creates emotional pain to help us “deal” with a situation. Pain is a protective mechanism in the body - it stops you from burning yourself or doing stupid shit. Your brain creates the pain to create distance and to try to protect you from whatever the “harmful” stimulus is. 

So if your partner is the stimulus, (always is for me, woohoo), think of yourself like one of those shaky starving dogs that someone finds on the street that snaps when people try to help it. That dog is not evil…it’s terrified! it’s in fight or flight mode, it’s feeling emotional pain. It lashes out because it is protecting itself. Poor shaky dog - if you have a sweet person reaching out but they don’t know how to handle terrified dogs and they just go to pet it normally, they’re gonna get bit and then get angry at the dog. 

In this case we probably all had some fucked up shit happen to us in childhood and creating emotional pain helped us deal those situations. For me having neglectful parents? Crying and entering the “fight” mode of “fight or flight”. I cry and cry, we beg for what will make us feel better, we manipulate, we cajole, we convince - we do everything in our power to get the attention we needed to survive.


Unfortunately for us, we can’t force our partners to be therapists and know how to handle this shit because that’s an unequal relationship. And just know that asking for reassurance is maladaptive. It just doesn’t work to solve that stabbing fear. 

BUT! I think an important question to ask yourself is: does he give good reassurance when I’m calm? When I’m in a good place and ask for reassurance it usually goes over super well. So that’s a sign for me that he does give good reassurance normally - I just need to reroute my fear through the part of my brain that can hear it. Happy dog brain, not shaky snappy dog brain.

However if your partner doesn’t want to reassure you normally or won’t be reassuring in other ways that’s a larger problem",Astrnougat,True,1707192190.0

Here's the thing: people accidentally hurt other people's feelings *constantly*.

Similarly, you might not be able to predict how something will affect you until you experience it.

It's just a process of trial and error as you get to know each other more and more, and eventually, it will get easier.

I guess even though our partners aren‘t as sensitive as us they still struggle with insecurities. Maybe we need to try to show them more compassion about this but I‘m not sure how.

Basically you make yourself do something even though you really don't want to/don't feel up to doing it etc.  And setting out small, attainable goals for yourself each day. Simple goals like brush your teeth, brush your hair, washed some dishes etc. 

If you also keep track of everything you do during the day, no matter how small or irrelevant it might seem, you'll see how much you're actually accomplishing! 

For water intake, keep a big bottle near you, if you don't have to move around to get a glass you might be more likely to drink it. I also find using a bottle with a straw helps me get through it better. Theres also a very cute app called Plant Nanny that you can input your water intake and make cute plants grow, might encourage you to keep up the habit!

Most importantly, don't forget how much you're actually doing every day already. You're getting out of bed, you're going to work! and doing so much else.

1af772w,"I have BPD and I have been with my partner for over four years. We moved in together in March. Our relationship has survived because I consider myself to be nearly twice as knowledgeable, self-aware, and matured since I realized I had BPD in 2016 and went through the process of getting a heavy-lifting DBT certified therapist (who I will see weekly until she retires). To this day, he does not know I have BPD. In 2016 I was 23 and I was on my fourth year of a relationship with a 27 year old man who said we’d be married within a year or so. He broke up with me a few months after I told him I believed I had BPD. I dated on and off for a few years after that and destroyed myself from fear of abandonment and doing the most emotional labor for toxic men. When I met my current boyfriend….something felt different. I didn’t feel cured, but I felt like… the version of me that wasn’t at the mercy of my BPD. I felt safe? And also confident? And sane? So that’s why I didn’t tell him. He just did not feed any of my symptoms. I didn’t know it was possible and I never thought I could be in a relationship without the internal backlash. 

It’s NOT perfect. Although we never yell at each other, swear, get aggressive, seek revenge, have issues with monogamy, any of that… it’s my first time living with a partner and it is HARD. I’ve got some pretty poignant maladaptive coping mechanisms (like sitting in my car in the driveway until 1 AM when I have to be up at 5) that my parent and therapist, as well as him, are helping me work through. Guess what time it is? 1 AM. 

I think the two reasons I have been able to maintain this relationship and cohabitation are 1) I found a genuinely safe well balanced empathetic person who was willing to commit 2) I was and am that committed to self improvement, awareness, and growth, forever. It’s like I became an NFL player for being better after I got drafted. I often worry that won’t continue if he breaks up with me. But I have never once had a reason to believe he would… except for me having too many red flags. This is the first time I’ve ever been in a relationship and been able to (or obligated to) fix myself instead of my partner. So that’s absolutely terrifying.

There's no such thing as a non hurtful relationship. Even between two neurotypical people. As long as you establish a good and honest communication, solve problems together and don't try to soldier it on yourself, it'll be fine. Always, ALWAYS tell your partner about your bpd early on. 

Not everyone is equipped to deal with a borderline and that's fine. They don't have to be. But we need the people who are equipped to deal with us. They exist. Usually mentally healthy and stable people are the ones we need. As long as we try to be good people, go to therapy and work on issues, what else is there? Neurotypicals are far from perfect yet usually they refuse to even acknowledge that there's something wrong let alone go to therapy. 

The hurtful and dangerous borderlines are those who refuse to believe what they're doing is wrong, don't take accountability for their own actions and refuse to go to therapy or work on any issues. Those are the people who have abused those bpdlovedone survivors. A lot of those people have also self diagnosed BPD on their previous loved one, because they have negative stereotypes.

I'd recommend short cut to answer vs going nuts trying to ID on own. Regardless of where you live, reach out to Mcleans experts. Viewed as the leading hospital intimately familiar w BPD.

Ask if someone would just chat and even give thoughts re properly skilled experts in your home area.  

Or even see if they have ST inpatient too if viable option for you 🤷‍♂️

A lessor option but can go to Dr Fox youtube and find info/DM re direct outreach to his TX practice.  Same premise as for McLean.

The rest of the borderline population are actually very very vulnerable, naive...child-like. Gullible. People who are easily swayed. So it's easy for a doctor to come up with some ""breakthrough technique"" such as ""DBT"",  that costs an arm and leg, and try to pitch it to people with this diagnosis. 

People with APD and NPD, even though they are flawed personality, wise tend to be a little bit more sharper, and a little bit more clever, because they have more cognitive empathy. They're not gonna fall for that. So the mental health industry sort of leaves them alone. They let them seek to help when they want to.

Someone who has been diagnosed with NPD and/or ASPD who is sincerely seeking treatment and is begging to get better already has a huge indicator for success because if you can get to the point of accepting it, you've already done something that is statistically against you and that's life-changing. 

The good news is that more and more research and people-first education for providers is shifting how the profession receives and treats cluster Bs. The overlap between NPD and BPD indicates that they're both highly misunderstood trauma disorders and probably two ends of the exact same spectrum.

19filzm,"Hey! I’m a fellow woman with BPD and I want to start just by saying how amazing it is that you as her partner want to help and are willing to do what you can, despite whatever emotional turmoil you both are going through. More often than not I see people bashing their partners with BPD more than wanting to support and help. And I think that’s honestly a really great place to start. 

For me personally when I am having episodes where I feel like people hate me, reassurance is all I want and need. But like you said, when in episodes we can tend to be a bit reactive and- I like how you put it -“prickly”. And that’s because we’re deep in our head and feelings and it’s really hard to take us out of that space once we’re in it. Sometimes it can take an hour, or even a whole day. It’s hard to tell honestly. All I can really recommend for you to do is just continue what you’re already doing. 

Or if she’s a physical touch person, like me, you could maybe talk about whether a hug or cuddle might help her? I know for me when I’m panicking or becoming overwhelmed with my emotions I’ll say I want to be left alone when really all I want is to be held. Words don’t comfort me, because to me words aren’t always true. People lie, people say what you want to hear, not what you need to hear. But the presence and safety I feel when my partner hugs me is UNMATCHED. Even if I resist at first, once he holds me, even during some of my most ridiculous baby tantrums, I’m usually able to take a breath and calm down. Because you can’t fake intimacy or physical touch. And it’s an obvious form of “I’m here with you, you’re not alone”. And once I’m calmed down, then he’s able to talk to me about what just happened. And I’m able to more clearly and rationally look at my thoughts and behavior critically. 

I hope this helped! Good luck to you both",qu4rterRic4n,False,1706220794.0

She's very resistant to physical touch when she's in that headspace but your point about it being an intimacy you can't fake has me wondering whether there might be some other form of intimacy that gives her that same sense of comfort and safety.

It seems like a lot of us can be prone to issues with pulling back or dealing with anxiety thoughts when a relationship gets serious or comfortable as it can trigger things within us. A lot of us also crave a certain type of chaos within relationships and it’s high highs but extremely low lows. 

I don’t think it’s too late for you nor should you have a scarcity mindset. I worry a bit since you say the relationship has become toxic, that needs to be worked on. And if it’s abusive you need to leave. 

If you feel like the relationship has become codependent , it can be easier to feel bored as we are so absorbed into the other person as our source of meaning/entertainment/happiness. I would try to get back into some of the things you enjoy that have nothing to do with him and maybe take more time doing things alone or with other supportive people. You could also try to build excitement within the relationship

First off, it's ok to feel this way, accept you feel it, but don't let it run the show. 

Second, is he aware of your diagnosis? Communication is very important to a BPD person, so be sure to communicate your needs clearly and with kindness when they arise. 

This in general is a self worth issue and can be ""cured"" through cultivating stability within your own life (like trusting yourself to take the best care of yourself, nurturing your own interests and in general being curious about yourself, there's so much to discover and life is long enough), try to build stable friendships outside of the relationship to have a solid foundation to lean on.

Definitely do not keep it to yourself. I know it's scary but it's the only way for us to have a happy relationship. I've been through several and trying to deal with it on my own just leaves everyone horribly scarred.

Communicate! Don't be afraid to bother him, this is every bit as much his problem as it is yours. Figure out solutions together. Tell him what you said about this post and ask him if he knows any solutions.

You'll be showing him trust and invulnerability. If he's the right one for you, he'll be able to handle it. If not, that's okay. Not everyone is strong minded. Not everyone needs to be. But the ones for people like us have to be. And if he's independent then he sounds like a good candidate for a stable relationship and a strong, sound mind.

It _will_  get better over time. My fiancé has ADHD and we used to do breakup threats and all that shebang: big, impulsive fights. We got through that. I used to feel terrified every time he said we don't work out anymore, but every time we made up and it was fine.

It got less and less. It still happens every once in a blue moon, more just thoughts rather than direct announcements. But I no longer feel scared of it, at all actually. 98% of the time we discuss things calmly now.

Also I have a hint of a box of memories! Or an archive in general. I store pictures, tokens, conversations, text messages anything that remind me how much he loves me. For example, I LOVED this pair of shoes from a TV show (izombie, recommend!) and he went and tracked them down for me and bought them as presents!

Whenever I feel unsure, I look in this archive and think about all the nice things we've seen and done. I also use lavender oil to relax myself and take a nice hot bath. Then I try to distract myself and do something else. If it's really bothering me I have a conversation with my fiancé and he'll be happy to reassure me :)

I also made a plan what to do if a breakup really does happen. Literally like step by step instructions how to deal with it. First immediate first aid is to call my mother and make arrangement to go home. Then call my boss and take vacation. I've planned some methods to stop SH. Block his cell, pack and get going. This also helped me, I wouldn't fall on empty if worse came to be.

19853fm,"If you live in a city, check out the local universities. I don’t know why no one else does this. I have gotten almost free therapy and now extremely cheap DBT for three years now by going through a university.

I am doing therapy with doctorate students at an Ivy League and one of the best psychological schools in the world. It’s the best therapy I’ve ever gotten and it’s by FAR the cheapest.

Go online, apply to the CBT center and the DBT center. I pay nothing per session. NOTHING. And I pay 150$ a semester for DBT. That 150$ for DBT group sessions for 12 weeks. 

Most universities and colleges have a program that trains their therapists for dirt cheap. Plus your case is brought (anonymously) to their professors and to their classmates and they pick it apart and explore it and compare it against case studies and textbooks, it’s basically therapy done by an entire class, not just your therapist.

That being said, I worked at getting a therapist for months. I followed up weekly with multiple schools in my area and ended up getting picked up by the Ivy League - but I had four schools calling me at one point and I had my pick of the litter.

if you’re deep in the trenches, the iop might be what you need to really pull yourself out of it. either way, the main thing that makes dbt work is you putting in the work. good luck!

I had more than one therapist tell me that I truly needed to get away from my mom for at least a year in order to heal. I started listening after the second therapist, but I couldn’t really execute getting away and separating our lives completely enough until about five years ago. It’s been worth every bit of struggle I had to go through to pull it off.

2) I did 2 full rounds of DBT and continue with therapy to this day. I’ve gone from two appointments a week plus group to one individual session every two weeks. I didn’t talk to my therapist for a month over the holidays and I didn’t even notice. I was with both of my most triggering family members over the holiday - nothing happened. No outbursts or meltdowns, no nothing. I don’t know exactly how they felt but I maintained a peace and calm the whole time and I never could have done that without therapy.

3) Exercise/nutrition/declutter - it may seem that only the first two are related (and their benefits obvious) but we are a sensitive group and the environment affects the mind more than a lot of people realize. Eat your fruits and veg, shower, brush your teeth, sleep as well and as regularly as you can and those things alone can make anyone feel better.

So I started reading the BPD subs, and eventually started posting on them. But I got banned from the two main ones despite always being respectful and calm. I think it was my view that some of the ""standard"" BPD behaviours (push-pull, the FP relationship etc.) are *inherently abusive* that got me banned. 

I still read the BPD subs and find them a contradictory mix of people:

* seeing themselves as innocent victims of BPD, and completely oblivious to how their behaviour harms others, or
* breaking down in shame at the realisation of how their behaviour harms others.

I'm not sure whether these are:

* two separate groups of people, or 
* the same people at different times. 

For my own ex pwBPD it was definitely the latter, which was very confusing and crazy-making. Imagine dealing with somebody you love whose position alternated between ""I'm the victim and I've done nothing wrong"" and ""OMG, I'm so sorry, I'm a toxic monster"".

I think this is part of the reason why pwBPD are banned from BPDlovedones. For every pwBPD who might have useful insights there will be many who will be triggered and react chaotically to the tales of abuse.

Regarding activities that maybe he didn't have an interest in but you did, I'd recommend looking into attending (example could be bouldering or attending a gallery, joining a community you know he wouldn't have enjoyed, going to a concert of a band you like but he isn't a fan of). Doing things that don't lead to you wishing you were sharing the experience with him will help you. 

Meet up with friends you haven't seen, whether IRL or via video call. Etch out time for yourself as a free agent. Gradually things will become easier and distraction can hugely help.

18ybvpv,"Aw I’m so sorry, big thing with BPD is we personalize things a lot, so the first step is to write down all the possible reasons these people might be cutting you off that have nothing to do with you “needing to be better”.

I had a friend disappear and it really hurt for a long time, when she finally popped back into existence she had had a mental breakdown and had quit school and moved back into her parents and had a bunch of difficult life shit happen where she just completely isolated herself. Wasn’t about me at all.

Also if you have BPD, it’s very likely that your sibling is probably pretty fucked up themselves as well, since BPD is usually a mix of having a sensitive temperament and having an abusive family life. So they might be blaming you for some shit that is really an internal problem with themselves. 

When I started my healing journey I personally was REALLY angry at a lot of people in my family and removed myself from them for a while, and as I healed more I realized I was blaming them for a lot of things that they had no control over and I eventually came around with much more empathy and appreciation and with realistic expectations of who they were as people instead of expecting them to be perfect. 

Lastly, if your BPD was really severe, you may have really harmed these people and caused damage that simply can’t be undone by a year or two of better behavior. It sucks, but that might be the reality of the situation and there is NOTHING you can do about it. 

You have worked hard to get better and seem to be doing a great job. You just have to accept the result of what is happening and hope that one day these people will come around. Take these things with peace in your heart knowing that you took all the steps possible to get better and that you DID it, and their inability to move on from past hurts or their personal problems have no reflection on who you are NOW. 

This moment is all about reality acceptance, and all about knowing in your CORE that you did absolutely everything you could to get better and to be better, and you will continue in that journey, and if these people can’t see that or appreciate that in you then maybe they aren’t a good fit in your life anymore.

Lastly, as we heal, I found that a lot of my more “trauma-centered” friendships fell away. The friends of mine who we bonded over our dating woes or who had trauma themselves and we would talk about our troubles all the time and would basically just trauma dump on eachother - those people didn’t really fit in my life anymore. Suddenly to them I was boring! I was all about building healthy habits, I was about sleeping 8 hours every night, working out to stay mentally stable, I was focused on my work and on maintaining healthy relationships. To them that was boring! They wanted to drink and smoke cigs and do drugs and disassociate from themselves and from life and I was no longer into that. I no longer found talking about my trauma to be so interesting, I no longer found victimizing myself to be the way through life. 

We didn’t have anything in common anymore. Sometimes we heal past our unhealthy relationships. Just something to think about.

I’m so sorry these people did this to you, but since others in your life seem to agree that you aren’t the problem, it’s time to practice reality acceptance and embrace your path forward without them. Good luck ❤️",Astrnougat,False,1704396064.0

18wx1gl,"I think a good foundation to start with is learning how to radically forgive yourself and then lessen the shame that comes from the emotional overwhelm you feel. The biggest thing we do is double up on the shame between how we feel about our true selves under all the bullshit and how others say we are.

But I want you to stop and ask yourself: Were any of these observations truly about you, or were they projected onto you from someone else's point of pain?

How often are you projecting your feelings onto someone? If it's often, why? Do you really think they feel that way, or does that feeling kind of feel like it's lying, somewhere deep down?

If it's lying, examine that. What is that part of you fighting to stand on your feet?

And then, the hardest part, is admitting it all to yourself.

But what comes from this is a reconfiguration of how you perceive yourself. I think of it as playing opposite land. I know from having these symptoms, something flipped upside down. I trust that observation, but I won't anymore let anyone's observations overweigh my goal of who I aspire to be. Instead, I'm pushing through those opinions that don't settle well with me and actually standing up for what I need.

So when I feel fear and doubt about myself, but underneath it all I feel I'm actually listening to the wrong signal (and this observation took a while), I can realize that's what *misperception* feels like.

I hope some of this made sense. If not, I'm happy to answer questions and try other methods. I think there's definitely a way to explain this all from an impartial and logical view that us folks who need that full rulebook feeling can read and go, ""*OH THAT'S HOW IT WORKS*""

Also, one big thing I realized about me this year that really brought it down was finding out I'm autistic and get those meltdowns, and also that ADHD folks have meltdowns too. It doesn't need to be a full diagnosis (though I've had ADHD diagnosed for 30 years now and was officially dx as ASD this year being tested for it for the first time), and frankly, out of everyone, we really don't need to be putting ourselves in buckets that have way more nuance than science has figured out yet. But knowing my overwhelmness and meltdowns are directly affecting my emotional responses to my trauma triggers has *seriously* helped me separate my feelings with my responses and make it easier to take *some* control of the situation.

DBT was really helpful, but that only goes so far when your core beliefs aren't being worked through.

Look a lot into the basis of a person's belief system, where BPD symptoms seem to be coming from (there's new evidence BPD is super-aggravated PTSD with untreated neurospicy aspects), and how to manage autistic meltdowns. While you may not be on the spectrum, stimming and those calming techniques may help you regulate while you try to be more observant of your responses and try to be less judgmental of your failures, and way more forgiving of your mistakes.

And #1 advice: Don't be afraid of who you'll be as you get through these things. You can't get to the other side of growth without growing pains, so all you can do for yourself is be forgiving of something completely and utterly normal.",MustProtectTheFairy,False,1704647010.0

Don’t try to blame them for causing you to relapse either lmao, they’ll just call you toxic (even though they’re the ones being toxic). Your best bet is to think about horrible things done to them, kindly state your boundaries and wish them loving kindness (pain and suffering).

Most people WILL take your kindness for granted and whether you wish them death or prosperity they will think the same. People do not change. You cannot force them to.

18vl47n,"I can offer some help in the context of DBT skills, as a seasoned veteran and someone in recovery from BPD. I'm not sure if you've been through DBT or anything, so please feel free to let me know if you don't understand any/all of what I say. Sorry this is a bit of a long post, but I'm passionate about helping people with these skills as they really do help.

Firstly, you need to establish whether the emotion you're feeling is either envy or jealousy (it could be both). Envy would be if you want a significant other, and your friend having one is eliciting these emotions in you. Jealousy would be if you feel threatened by your friend's relationship with their SO. it does sound like jealousy, but I just want you to be 100% clear on this, as you can't change an unwanted emotion if you're not identifying the right one.

So let's say it is jealousy. You would then use the 'Check the facts' skill link: [Check the facts worksheet ](https://www.carepatron.com/templates/check-the-facts-dbt-worksheet) to determine whether the emotion of jealousy and/or its intensity fits the facts. 

To be perfectly honest, whilst jealousy might be UNDERSTANDABLE if your friend is your FP and you have BPD, in this situation, jealousy is not justified. It is not appropriate for you to assume your friend should have a closer relationship with you than their SO, and it's not going to be effective for you to act on this emotion because it will likely drive your friend away and decrease your level of self respect.

The solution then, if you are feeling an unwanted emotion that is not justified, is a DBT skill called 'Opposite Action'. The idea is that you have to act ALL THE WAY OPPOSITE to the emotion of jealousy. Now, this doesn't mean pretending you're not jealous, or being fake, or any of that. It is important for you to acknowledge that your jealousy is understandable because you have BPD, that the emotion now is likely because of earlier life experiences, and to validate how you're feeling. But you also need to tell yourself that this is your friend, you don't need to compete for their affection, and jealousy is a very destructive emotion if you act on it without reason. 

Here is an article on how to act opposite to jealousy when it is not justified, as well as a helpful explanation on the difference between jealousy and envy: [DBT - Jealousy vs Envy ](https://www.mindfulnessmuse.com/dialectical-behavior-therapy/jealousy-vs-envy). You will probably need to keep doing this repeatedly, but I promise you that once you keep acting opposite (ALL THE WAY), the emotion will change, and you will not feel jealousy as strongly/at all.

It is also helpful to more widely analyse your emotions and understand whether this is primary or secondary. I don't want to overwhelm you, but calling back to my earlier point, if you don't know what emotion you're feeling, then it's difficult to try and change or address an unwanted emotion. Here is some more info on the difference between primary and secondary emotions [Primary vs Secondary emotions ](https://richerlifecounseling.com/primary-and-secondary-emotions/#:~:text=Primary%20emotions%20are%20the%20first,protect%20yourself%20in%20some%20way.) Essentially, primary emotions are emotions you feel directly because of an event or trigger, and secondary emotions are emotions you feel because of those primary emotions coming up.

The reason I mention this is because I think jealousy is really just a response to fear. You are scared that someone might threaten your relationship with your friend. In this instance, just doing the check the facts skills but for fear can help.

I would then try and tap into your wise mind, which is a synthesis of your rational mind and emotion mind. More info on this is here [Wise Mind ](https://www.manhattancbt.com/wise-mind-dbt/#:~:text=In%20DBT%2C%20wise%20mind%20is,sometimes%20more%20pronounced%20than%20others)

As a person with BPD I'd imagine you probably hang out more in emotion mind. There is nothing wrong with either of these states of mind, rational or emotional, but if you know you're prone to strong emotions then bringing some rational thought along with self validation and wisdom can help prevent you from being ruled by your emotions and see things in a clearer way. As I've said, the consequence of you completely acting on the emotion of jealousy is likely that you will alienate your friend.

Wise mind is a state you can cultivate, and you can start doing this by honouring your emotions so that you are soothing them, as well as by the kind of thoughts you entertain about a situation that might be causing you distress. Because us BPDers have a tendency for strong emotional reactions, we can also be prone to black and white thinking, where things, people, events, situations, etc, are either all good or all bad. The key to overcoming BPD symptoms and reducing emotional reactivity is engaging in a different thinking style called dialectics. Dialectics basically means holding in your mind the idea that two, seemingly conflicting, things can be true, and can help combat black and white thinking and the extreme emotions that can cause it and be caused by it by helping you to see the grey area. For example, in the case of your friend and their SO:

It's possible for my friend to care about me AND their SO

My friend can make time for both of us

I can really care about my friend AND not be threatened that someone else also really cares about them 

My friend can be in a partnership AND be friends with me 

Think about how you feel when you tell yourself that. Notice how the emotional reactivity goes down.

I'd also look at other emotions that might be at play here. It sounds a little bit like you're sad that your friend has someone else important in their life (it is possible to feel all of these different emotions at once). I think it sounds like sadness is justified because you have your friend who is your FP and feel sad when they can't maybe spend all their time with you. I would encourage you in this case to problem solve. Generally speaking, if an emotion is justified and keeps coming up for you, you need to do something about it. The DBT skill is actually called Problem Solving, and there's a worksheet for it here [DBT Problem Solving ](https://www.carepatron.com/templates/dbt-problem-solving-worksheet)

It sounds to me that your problem to solve is loneliness and/or a small social circle. Use the problem solving worksheet to think of ways to alleviate this. Get creative and think of as many ideas you can to solve this. It could include tending to existing relationships your life instead of putting all your efforts into this friend/relying on them so heavily. It could be finding ways to meet new people. Think of as many as you can and then follow the worksheet to complete the process.

I do promise you can work through this and make your life better. It sounds harsh but you can't rely on other people to make you happy or to satisfy all of your needs. You need to do this for yourself, and if you put all this pressure on your friend then the chances are they will not be able to handle it very well.

 Like I said, I don't know if you're even remotely familiar with DBT and appreciate this is a LOT of information. Please feel free to message me if you have any queries.",PuzzleheadedVisual77,False,1704150626.0

18tw66e,"I had TMS! Just finished about two weeks ago. Here’s what I noticed. 

1. My physical symptoms all went away. My *physical* depression (fatigue, brain fog), anxiety (stomach aches, nausea) etc. all disappeared. It also helped greatly with binge eating. I don’t find myself craving unhealthy habits anymore, for the most part lol. 

2. I still get sad and anxious as any other human, but I’ve found it’s appropriately placed. For example, instead o being anxious all the time, I’m anxious when a cop turns on their light behind me, as most people would. And then I’m able to calm down pretty quickly. I get sad when something sad happens, but I am quick to address it. 

3. I’m able to address and cope with my emotions much easier. I still deal with mood swings, but instead of being held down by my moods, I’m able to use my coping skills and self care to address them. I’m able to say “okay, right now I’m feeling angry. What can I do in this moment to deal with this?” And then I follow through. That’s been the biggest improvement for me - being able to actually follow through on the emotional regulation.

4. I have more energy to do things. I picked up hiking as a hobby and it’s been going great. I usually quit things easily (ADHD) but with hiking I stick to it and I don’t get discouraged when it gets hard. 

The way I view TMS is not a cure for the symptoms, but it’s like taking the huge weight that’s crushing you off in order for you to be able to address what you need to address. The physical symptoms are gone, the trauma is still there, but I’m able to work through it because I’m much more clear headed. 

If you can get it covered I’d highly recommend it. In total, I had to spend about $600 out of pocket, but the total cost would’ve been somewhere near $16k without insurance. 

I’d highly recommend also finding a clinic with a good technician. Some technicians just turn on the machine and leave you alone. My tech actually did some CBT and DBT skills while the machine was on, and I feel like it really helped to solidify those therapies in my head.

18se0ul,"This comes from someone who recently learned the hard way.

I understand the ""all i wanted was for others to give me another chance"" part. But hey.. I wish I had stuck to my boundaries and committed to myself like u. I gave a man a chance because he wanted to be better. 3 chances became who knows how many and 6 months of broken promises, my first psyc ward visit, and a broken mind and heart. All for straying from my road to recovery. As much as I thought he was absorbing all these resources, he'd be so excited and I'd feel great and then he'd go right back to his old ways.

One thing is to want, and the other is to do. If ur partner doesn't even want to do either, and u stay carrying the load and the ""hope,"" you might just end up crying more than me right now, lol. Ur work and commitment is what will pave a new way of living.

I think giving a chance or 2 is ok.. depending on your comfort or goals. But anything past that, no. As bpd peeps, we know we hurt people along our journey. We might have even exhausted those peeps and maybe held them back in many ways.

I think it's important to acknowledge that our behavior was unhealthy back then and to put a stop to it on others who are trying to do that to us (intentionally/unintentionally). In a way, we are now in the shoes of those we hurt and can feel empathy towards them on a new level. Also, helping those who still struggle in a different way like being kind and compassionate and sharing resources but not getting pulled back in hope and knowing when to let go and when to stop helping.

Tough choices, theres only so much you can do, but ultimately, don't abandon your goals for others who won't help themselves or pretend to.

If we don't put a stop to the cycle, we will be back in the shadows we worked so hard to climb out of. Thats where im at, but im optimistic. We learned, and now we need to watch out for ourselves in a healthy, selfish way and stick to it.

18se0ul,"I was diagnosed by a team apparently in 2018 and not told about the bpd until I suspected it on my own earlier this year and asked my therapist. She said oh yeah its in your dx codes. That came from a practicing psychiatrist who spent hours with me. I had known for years that there was more than anxiety depression and suicidal plans, but didn't recognize the fear of abandonedment until earlier this year. That prompted me to take a deep dive into what bpd is like from the inside. And I found so much.....I finally felt like wow....there *are* other people like me. It was kinda a relief to know that there was an actual disorder, a predictable , treatable thing.
As opposed to being demon possessed, rebellious, ""difficult"", annoying, ive been labeled with every negative character flaw ever. Now I know whats wrong w me, and a better idea of what to work on and how I got this way. (Severe physical abuse from toddler age to 14, coupled w dismissal, isolation, and lots of verbal abuse and rejection.)

I know some people hate labels but for me it was a relief, but also a seriously sobering reality. The first time I tried to commit suicide I was 10, and houldnt figure out how to make a belt work for that purpose. I was five the first time I remember having thought patterns of classic bpd.  Ive been fucked in the head for a long time, and it took 4 decades to figure it out. 

My parents didn't believe in psychiatrist help and barely medical. I was severely neglected. My first dental visit was at 18. For at least ten straight years as a child after age 7 i didn't see the inside of a school, or doctors office. My parents felt that any problems just required more paddling (beating with boards) I was beaten avg of 5-10x week. There was no time that my butt wasnt covered in bruises at different stages of healing. As an adult i know this isn't normal or ok but until recently I internalized that I was just a rotten person who deserved to be beaten.

18p8weo,"Lots of questions. I’ll answer the best I can, from my own experience. 

1. Yes, I have recovered. My psychiatrist declared me officially in remission back in May of this year, based on a reevaluation. I only exhibit two of the nine criteria now. 

2. You never don’t have BPD. If you have it, you have it. When a person has “recovered,” that just means they have developed the skills to manage the symptoms. And, you can relapse. 

2. For me personally, going into remission hasn’t affected my memory at all. It’s still the same as it was before. 

3. I was professionally diagnosed. I heavily advocate against the self diagnosis of BPD. 

4. Yes. 

5. I was diagnosed with BPD traits when I was twelve. My symptoms presented severely enough that I was able to be diagnosed when I was sixteen. I went into remission at age 22. 

6. Yes.

7. Some people with BPD don’t need medication, but many do.

8. I did a combination of DBT, CBT, and a tiny bit of EMDR. I’m also on meds, but the cocktail that works for me may not work for everyone else. 

9. This is a difficult question to answer because it’s hard to put into words how I feel, so I just put it like this: I’m not suicidal anymore. I’m happy, I’m thriving, and I’ve literally never been better. 

10. BPD is the most treatable of the cluster B personality disorders. From what I’ve read, recovery is pretty common, but so is relapse. 

11. I’m not absolutely horrible to be around anymore. People genuinely enjoy my company. I’m a wonderful fiancé (his words, not mine) and my recovery is reflected through my grades as well; I’m a straight A student.",,False,1703351313.0

18p8weo,"Well it's not a mental illness in the sense where illnesses could be cured eventually. It's a disorder that is about your personality. That's a big word.  

Can your personality be cured? No. Can it change? Yes, to some degree. Personality is a very broad term and encompasses many things. Some of which are capable of change.

I am currently in remission. I am in a stable point of my life, safe. I don't want to hurt myself, I don't feel empty, I don't have extreme emotions that I can't deal with anymore. I don't go from love to hate, I don't take eons to calm down anymore. I can be by myself and be okay with it, I don't blame myself or hate myself. I feel proud of myself! 

I just mainly feel like I'm more safe. I can have strong emotions still but I'm not overwhelmed by them. I don't feel overly scared anymore. I have PTSD though and very severe trust issues so some of my symptoms (such as stress induced paranoia) will probably never leave because they're being amplified by other issues.

I was professionally diagnosed by a group of psychiatrists. The process started when I was 19, I got diagnosed officially at age 20. I had meds for it, and started DBT. Midway DBT I quit my meds and realized that they were making me far worse and I believe that quitting them caused my remission, together with therapy. I'm now 24.

My psychiatrist together with my therapists declared me to be on remission and my therapy discontinued. My fiancé and I are doing much better now and are much closer. Our fights are pretty far and few and very easily resolved. Generally our life is much easier.

The statistics are easily Googleable, but the likelihood of both recovery and relapse are high. I have no idea about the condition of my amygdala, I've never had an MRI or other head imaging. But as an RN (registered nurse) myself, my educated guess would be that my amygdala hasn't had any growth haha.

If you mean should you tell people that you're about to suicide, the answer is no, never. If you're asking should we communicate that we are feeling that extreme, the answer is yes.

Instead of saying I want to die, use actual descriptive words. I might be off the mark but from personal experience, you don't want to die. You want to escape. What do you want to escape? Probably some feeling. What feeling? Shame? Anger? Disappointment? Fear? Insecurity?

What's the reason behind that feeling? Discuss it out loud. Diffuse the situation. Do NOT leave to 'deal with it by yourself'.

Wow lmao. Doesn’t seem like you’ve improved too much either, considering how rude and immature your response was. I’m not sure your point here. Diet, exercise, & therapy is not a catch-all that will fix everything. If it does, sounds like maybe you never were severely mentally ill.

And while I agree that some psychedelic drugs can certainly assist in healing the body and mind, I wouldn’t call it “therapeutic medicine”; it is **not a cure** and it is honestly irresponsible to suggest seriously mentally ill individuals to try mind-altering substances as a “cure” without being under the care of a physician. 

And, not that this is any of your business, but I see a therapist weekly, I go to the gym regularly & have been making a consistent effort to maintain a better diet for almost two years.

18mocsv,"you could probably benefit from Internal Family Systems. When you have therapy that heals your inner child, then diet, exercise, and maintaining homeostasis is going to do even more wonders for you in the long term. Of course doing these things I said that have helped me out have only made their biggest impact when I was in the process of healing my inner child.

Doing these things like diet and exercise on a regular schedule is certainly not going to heal the inner child itself, but it at least provides landing gear for the drop, because without exercise, good sleep, and diet, the three main ones I would say, are going to make your inner child go into haywire, very dysfunctional.

It's the best of both worlds if you do therapy that works, plus exercise, diet, and anything else that has helped you out.

Self compassion is really hard. It starts with feeling our feelings, paying special attention to how and where they feel in the body and sitting with them.

Please go for a harm reduction approach. It’s not helpful to hate yourself more for your actions, because ultimately even the parts of you that are causing you pain want your best interest.

I hope that you feel better soon, I'm not in a great mind space either so I can't offer more than thoughts for you. 

I often wonder about self prophesying thought patterns. 

The brain learns through repetition, conditioning. By expecting what we have seen/felt/lived before to repete itself, it is only logical that it does to some degree or another. 

Here's to hoping that we may be free of our shackles be they shame, loneliness, fear or any other form they may take.

18evi5c,I'm bipolar type 1 as well as bpd currently asymptomatic. Only because of a change in environment and getting married my husband has helped my mental health to an absolute extreme in a good way. But before I met him I used to have manic cycles where mine would be about every 3 months or so I would stay awake for as long as 72 to hours straight. I was hyper focused with blown pupils to the point that my dad actually said I looked like I was some kind of meth or coke addict. I have never touched drugs in my life. When these episodes would strike if I was lucky I could sleep for about an hour maybe 2 at a stretch but they didn't really change anything because I was so jittery. My bipolar was mostly characterized by extreme depression. I now know the extreme break down temper tantrums I've had most my teen and early adult years was the bpd most likely.

Now as for your partner, I feel like I could kinda tell (i’m making an assumption, could be wrong) by the way you were typing you were trying to not make him look bad, which I get because you love him. You should feel okay to be sad around him, but he shouldn’t be the only thing making you happy. If you feel like he is playing on your emotions, take some time to evaluate how and why a little more, and make conclusions for yourself. And if he knows leaving you hanging like that is gonna upset you, he should be a little more attentive. A text takes 2 seconds. 

some things are vague in this post so I can’t like confirm for sure if your relationship is super toxic but you can! And recovery is possible. And alone time, although really difficult, is very beneficial. Warming your own soul. 

In a bpd book I read they talk about how we think “others act upon me, therefore I am”. And when people aren’t there to love us at all times, we can be inescapable voids. So when you are alone maybe ask him to try reassuring you more, sticking to what he says he’s gonna do, and also filling up your cup.

Angering at your inner critic is a quick win, I don’t mean get angry at yourself, I mean get angry at the voice and what it is still trying to take from you. Your inner critic is an old defence mechanism from childhood and is developed to keep you safe. So it’s important to realise that you’re older and safer now, plus you have more agency, and thus you no longer need it or need to listen to it.

There’s also an outer critic that makes other people seem too dreadful and too scary to trust.

18ajdv8,"stick with it if you truly want this career. im in the same boat as you as well. have bpd but want to b a psychotherapist or smtg in that area. 

my advice is while youre studying classes, make sure youre also getting better. im not sure where youre at rn so maybe what im saying wont b as “beneficial” but try doing dbt courses, r/dbtselfhelp is also a fantastic sub that offers help from others, but also many many many resources like websites, work sheets, videos, etc. 

imo, having bpd allows us to really & truly connect with someone who is struggling. we understand & feel their emotions (maybe not everyone feels them, but for me i can feel their emotions & sense when someone is upset, angry, happy etc.) allowing us to b more help than someone who just uses logic in that field. of course, its a good balance of both, however, too strongly of one or the other can b a little tricky; general statement as well. 

while working towards lessening severity of symptoms & learning how to manage them & stay there (its a up & down journey though, but its worth it & the downs only make us stronger), & learning what youre doing rn & eventually getting into that career, itll balance itself out. it will prevent what others say or feel or are going thru not b as much of a trigger; youll know what to do in those kind of circumstances to prevent it from debilitating you, while also helping the patient. 

you can do this & honestly learning abt psychology alone will help anyone who struggles w any mental health issue. you learn how the brain works, why people behave the way they do, etc. itll give you more awareness while youre helping yourself.

growth mindset & a positive attitude will help a lot negating those negative, discouraging thoughts. what ifs are what ifs for a reason :). it takes time to get there & work, but giving yourself that time is so important. remember to not overwhelm yourself too much at once as well. that can put those bad thoughts back into a place they dont belong. step by step, one thing at a time.",,False,1701706136.0

Have your own therapist, and the cliche eat, sleep, and take care of your own needs.

189uw2v,"so crazy I’m just now seeing this because I’ve been rethinking my diagnoses. A lot of my symptoms due align with bpd, however since I was young I’ve displayed an insane amount of traits of autism typical in females, and was evaluated in kindergarten but my parents freaked out and didn’t want further testing because they “knew their kid wasn’t autistic”. I’ve also talked to my therapist about if bpd could sometimes just be traumatized autism, and it’s misdiagnosed, my my therapist in particular is not set on diagnoses in general and moreso just on talk therapy and coping skills. She doesn’t think labels help, which I can agree with sometimes. 

Either way for me, DBT still has been very helpful, but I do not really feel as though my diagnoses was correct after my attempt. But getting diagnosed with autism is hard, and I am not sure I would need to bc I feel like that’s been the case for many years. Even in my hospital eval chart they noted that my eye contact was avoidant, spoke in a certain way, plethora of things that align with autism presenting in adult women.

185hsqd,"Oh man - the “I ruined everything” is very strong with me too. The second I “mess everything up” I feel so horrible and spiral straight into reassurance seeking terribly.

Your partner said it was ok, and things might be tense for a while - BUT THATS OK.

Remember that relationships contain multitudes just as we do. We can experience sadness and also joy that we experience sadness at the exact same time. We can feel jealous but still enjoy a night out with friends. We contain multitudes and so do our relationships.

They can contain ease and love and still also be tense and angry AT THE SAME TIME. 

Just think if your partner did the same thing that you did, right back at you. And they apologized and felt terrible.

How would you feel? Would it take time for your annoyance with them to go away? Would it take time for you to be less angry at them but you would still love them anyway?

This weekend I pushed my partner to the limit until he broke. He had an outburst, just as I have done before. I can forgive his outburst because he realized it and apologized and I love him and know he is human and that I helped create it.

I bet you are not solely responsible for your outburst either.

Whenever I have an episode, and I’m coming down from it and I’m trapped in the shame/I ruined everything spiral - I like to think this:

There is always a reason. 

There is always a reason for my outbursts. Usually some unmet need or an unrealistic expectation that wasn’t met - but even at the core of expectations are our needs.

When I’m in the shame spiral like you are, I always come back to a question. Like “why didn’t you do x for me?” Why didn’t you show up for me? Why weren’t you there? Why wasn’t he able to call me back?

At the core of the question that started my episode, is a need.

Rephrase that core question into a statement. 

I feel ___when you ___because ___. I need _____.

Remember - your emotions are overreactions - not made up out of no where. What is the core of it? Speak that need and that usually resolved the shame because you realize you are imperfect and you need your needs to be met otherwise you will get hurt and overreact.",Astrnougat,False,1701130021.0
185hsqd,"I completely understand everything you said. I've been there myself. The guilt is terrible. The best thing I can suggest is to try to remember with the right person there is no such this as ""omg I messed everything up"". You can't mess up what is ment for to be (my boyfriend used to say this whenever id go into my guilt spiral)  Learning to believe that helped me stop going into that reassurance seeking stage which I'm thankful for because that always tended to piss people off more then whatever I had done that was apologizing for in the first place. I also used to be really bad about giving him the space he needed to regulate his own nervous system because my fear of abandonment would kick in hard. My therapist taught me to remember in healthy relationships sometimes it takes 20 mins for a person's nervous system to get back to normal. Instead of trying to force him to stop being mad I have to trust that if I give him the space he needs he isn't going to use the time to do anything that has to do with leaving me, he just is going to use the time to calm himself so we can move on with our day peacefully together. I have to trust him to do his part. and while he's doing that for himself instead of having anxiety about it Im supposed to use the time to calm myself down as well. It took a while to learn but Now I am confidently able to give him the space he needs to regulate his nervous without having any abandonment fears because he has proven to me so many times as soon as he is regulated he will be right there to reassure me he still loves me and everything is okay. And then we're able to talk about the original issue more calmly & come to a solution. 

Also please please try to forgive yourself for acting the way you did. Have compassion for yourself because you are only acting off of trauma responses and it is not your fault you went through trauma and were forced to adapt in order to survive.

185g43j,"What helped me a lot is understanding the physiology going on in the brain. BPD sufferers often have under developed amygdala’s from childhood trauma so it doesn’t fully develop. Amygdala’s regulate when there is a threat, but because ours are smaller they quickly get triggered/over stimulated, releasing cortisol and adrenaline into the bloodstream which makes us much more likely to freeze, fight, or flight. Often fight/yell is the reaction, together the frontal lobe that does the executive thinking eg.Frontal Lobe: ‘If I swear at the doctor the next time I visit ’she’s’ not going to be happy with me’ is turned off, the frontal lobe closes down because we think it’s an emergency like jumping out of danger of a car running us over but it’s not….it’s just the doctor being difficult. Taking notice of when I’m getting anxious eg when I feel a pressure sensation in my brain (flood of adrenaline) or sometimes my eyes get watery I can be aware more and more that I’m getting wound up. Each time I notice, I can just reduce talking/overthinking take some breaths and not let the horse bolt. I used to be extremely volatile (smash windows) and I’ve become soooo much calmer from just noticing this whole process unfolding. Sometimes I have anxiety attacks that go for 5 hours, but I just go for a walk with some music on and it helps reduce it. There are lots of techniques when you become aware its happening that will suit you….but becoming aware it’s happening is the first step.

r/dbtselfhelp is an amazing sub that offers a lot of help from others but also provides resources such as websites to learn from, videos you can watch, worksheets you can download, and much much more.

i can @ you in some of the posts from that sub that i have saved because i think theyre useful.

another good thing when trying to get better is to take on one thing at a time. you dont want to wear yourself out trying to learn or do several things at once, or each day. once youve learnt something you can do (just from browsing), choose something you think would b a good place to start (for example rn my main thing im working on is radical acceptance. while i am i am gathering information abt other things as well, but i am mainly focusing on acceptance.). overwhelming yourself is the last thing anyone should want to do. it can feel discouraging and make things feel impossible.

u/SarruhTonin also has very useful information on her youtube channel as she has been in remission for 2 years (im so proud of you sarruh!). she has some videos that get more into depth on the DSM-5 criteria and what exactly those mean, videos not specific to bpd but ways you can self-sooth, and much more. for me, and maybe it could b the same for you, hearing another person talk and get into detail abt what theyve learnt and ways you can get to where they are is for one inspiring but also can b a huge motivator. seeing others at the place you want to b, it gives you an idea and some insight of where you can evetually b, which is something to look forward to.

dr daniel fox (he has a phD and specializes in personality disorders npd, hpd, bpd, aspd) has a [website](https://drdfox.com/) that links his youtube channel, he has several worksheets you can download to work on that vary in range, he also has what books hes published listed as well, specifically his [""the borderline personality disorder workbook""](https://www.amazon.com/Borderline-Personality-Disorder-Workbook-Integrative/dp/1684032733/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2RLKK6YYLSXK8&keywords=borderline+personality+disorder+workbook&qid=1701013201&s=books&sprefix=borderline+personality+disorder+workbook%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C482&sr=1-1) which is on amazon. you can find all of his books/flash cards on amazon.

another helpful book that is for dbt for people learning on their own [""the dialectical behavioral therapy skills workbook""](https://www.amazon.com/Dialectical-Behavior-Therapy-Skills-Workbook/dp/1684034582/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=GkcSs&content-id=amzn1.sym.6e9da02f-f7a3-444f-aea6-9ef09ed8bb89%3Aamzn1.symc.c345d0cb-1369-4947-9d0b-b27eb6553273&pf_rd_p=6e9da02f-f7a3-444f-aea6-9ef09ed8bb89&pf_rd_r=ANDXS7YW0JJKPWX4TFT3&pd_rd_wg=IcvHh&pd_rd_r=1553335d-3c80-47c7-8805-99c867d163c7&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_d)

recently i learnt what emotion mind, reasonable mind, and wise mind are and it gave me some more insight and perspective.

STOP skill, IMPROVE skill, and TIPP skill can b handy to. as well as learning mindfulness, and sometimes meditation can help.

those are good places to start, and youll find more while searching for resources, ways to cope, etc. beware that there can b a lot of misinformation, but there still are good sources out there.

REMEMBER and this is key, please take it one step at a time. you deserve to have a good journey to get where you want to b. dont overwhelm yourself, know your limits. its okay if you dont do it in some way every single day. this is going to take time, but this time is so important. do not rush it, i dont want you to get discouraged or feel like giving up. there will and are going to b ups and downs, hopeful times and not so hopeful times, but recovery takes time and effort. the outcome will b so rewarding, every small improvement you make/get to will b so rewarding. once you get the ball rolling its hard for it to stop, but if it does, you can always give it another little push. you can do this. best of luck :)",,False,1701013871.0

181ol9a,"The most highly recommended therapy for folks with BPD is Dialectical Beahviour Therpy (DBT). Some swear by it, while others are more critical. In any event, DBT offers a lot of skills and tools to help focus on mindfulness, managing your emotions, learning to respond in ways that are less detrimental, and interpersonal communication. 

If you're looking for this kind of assistance, I would Google ""DBT skills and tools."" I believe there are a number of free resources and YouTube videos available. Whether you do or do not fit the criteria for a BPD diagnosis, if you struggle with overwhelming emotions, I think you may find some helpful stuff. 

I'm not sure that ""complete control"" is attainable in any sense, but I try to focus on every silver lining. The silver lining of overwhelming emotions can be feeling overwhelming positive emotions, like beauty or love or determination or appreciation. My responses to intense negative feelings have been detrimentally explosive at times, but the consideration and loyalty I can offer is top-notch. My journey has involved a lot of internal questioning, appreciating myself, and reality for the good, the bad, and the neutral. I've also realized the need to focus on positivity, as negativity had become my default. 

I'm sorry that you've experienced so much in your short life. You are so young and have so much ahead of you. You've made it through all you've mentioned (and what you didn't), and you're still here.

The thing is with BPD, we tend to take things personally and to the extreme. He doesn’t ask me to hang out = he hates me = everyone hates me. But the truth is, it’s often actually a smaller-scale situation than that abandonment we are used to. Don’t conflate the feeling with the situation.

17zoojy,"Congrats on getting help with BPD and addiction. I am in much the same boat. 84 days clean after 29 pretty solid years running any way I could. 41 now with so much time wasted.

Have you explored childhood trauma at all? It appears to be quite common for people with BPD. Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker is an excellent book. It’s about CPTSD but that too is still often quite relevant for pwBPD. A great deal of introspection may help you recover some memories and thus help you understand your current and previous behaviours better. This may possibly help form some weak foundation on which to base a sense of self. I am in the process of doing this at present.

Not understanding and doubting who we are is common. Despising oneself is common too, you’re not alone in that, but that doesn’t make it any less painful. I could list off things that others might say define me, but they’re all just coping strategies I’ve done a lot really, and they feel skin deep to me.

On the subject of loneliness, it’s absolutely desolate. Worse around people, and worse around people I care about. People seem so connected to one another, but they’re right there and a million miles away at the same time. I don’t know if this is how you feel, but I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.

If you have problems with trust, I recommend starting there. Trust is a willingness to be vulnerable for some perceived reward. However, if that reward never materialises, be it due to abuses/betrayal, or because the lack of connectedness we feel makes it very difficult, it’s hard to keep trusting and remain vulnerable, especially in light of feeling like a raw BPD nerve. Nevertheless it’s agonisingly necessary, as is the equally agonisingly authenticity when doing so. Try and show your authentic self, as in how you’re feeling and what you’ve been through, even though you despise it, because just possibly someone else won’t despise it. If you can start to trust enough to truly believe it when someone says that they value your presence, that they like you, that they love you even, then maybe you can begin to feel some degree of the connection and belonging we all deserve.

Once again, congrats on finally having the courage to stop running.",split-divide,False,1700495033.0
17zoojy,"Hey thanks and back at you - congratulations on 84 days. I first tried to get clean and sober about 3 years ago by myself but I kept relapsing. I'm at 45 days now since my last relapse. You describe so accurately what I'm experiencing right now, I'm in tears. 

I have worked through some of my trauma from childhood with my therapist, at least what I can remember anyway, but it's not very much. I will check out that book you shared. I have also been diagnosed with CPTSD. I have heard of people doing this thing called shadow journaling, but I don't really know what it is or if that would help me. Have you heard of shadow journaling? Can I ask you what you are doing to build that foundation?

""But they're right there and a million miles away at the same time.""

Oh...this. When I try and connect with people, it feels exactly like we are so far apart. Like I am trying to be someone I never can be, that if I show any of myself, they will see me for who I am and definitely never want to talk to me again. 

What you said about trust and willingness to be vulnerable really, really resonates with me. That's just the perspective I need to hear to motivate me to keep pushing through and putting myself out there. I stopped going to my recovery meetings because of the pain and confusion and haven't gone in almost 2 weeks, but it also really helped me to go. Knowing how I'm not alone in feeling this way and having this particular type of struggle is really helpful to me. Thank you so very much. It means a whole lot to me. So so much.",Alainasaurous,True,1700498171.0
17zoojy,"Sorry for the late reply, I found this really hard to reply to for some reason. I don’t really know why, but I promise it was nothing personal.

Thanks, it’s gotten easier, I also gave up caffeine 2 days ago, but still vaping nicotine. Relapse is perhaps expected I think until we get answers, but hopefully now you can recognise addiction as a symptom of BPD/CPTSD rather than a cure for some unknown ailment. I really hope that knowledge will perhaps give you strength in the darker times. But hey, if the worst happens, try not to be too Black & White about it. I know if I relapsed right now, be it on drugs or self-harm (kind of the same thing I know), abstinence would feel entirely ruined, but that too is a symptom we must both fight against.

I am glad what I said resonated with you and perhaps made you feel less alone in what you’re going through. Even if the loneliness remains, know that others are also where you are now right alongside you, even if you would pass each other on the street. It’s excellent that you were able to cry and in the process grieve a bit, that’s super important, as is learning to anger at the abuse and/or neglect you may begin to remember a little more, so that you can start to heal from it.

From what little I understand it’s pretty normal for people to not recall a great deal, but it might come in time and with work/introspection. Further to that you might be able to reframe things given enough introspection. For example, I have 3 days in my life that stood out and I have never truly forgotten, although access to all but 1 disappeared until recently. There is ‘the day the music stopped’, ‘the day I realised expressing was pointless’ and ‘the day I realised I could run riot’. The latter of the 3 was wholly wrong. It wasn’t the day I learnt I could run riot, it was the day I freed myself from fearful isolation and that abuse stopped. I was finally less scared of my parents than I was of the darkness alone upstairs. It was a day I should have been proud of, but I’d internalised it as me just running riot.

I had to google shadow journalling, and if this is what they meant https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/shadow-work I’ve been doing it already in a round about way. The next bit of my response rolls together your questions regarding shadow work and what I have been doing to try and build a foundation, it also ties heavily in to agonising vulnerability and grasping at some small ability to trust.

I have been part of a group of 10ish friends online for ~25years. It does not feel like I am part of them, but I leave and then go back to the chat server repeatedly for some reason I am yet to understand. They claim to want me there, but I don’t trust what they say, nor fathom what positivity they see in my presence, and so can’t internalise that sense of belonging at all. In fact I wish they’d end the exhausting charade and tell me to leave. Nevertheless, we made a psych focused chat room, and I have been talking or ranting or introspecting or some amalgamation of the three openly in that chat room. Largely to myself it feels like, but importantly where the closest thing to friends I have ever known can all see it. Sometimes it is punctuated by other people with varying degrees of variously healed trauma, but not hugely often. I will openly introspect, consider memories in order to challenge them, acknowledge and discuss triggers, link articles such as https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7357542/ (I feel bad if I let my AirPod battery get too low lol), rage when I am splitting, talk self harm, anger, grieve, talk about how I am feeling generally or more specifically (from joy and relief at feeling leg cramp -> hopelessness -> suicidal in the space of a few minutes), drug relapse, how I personally define emptiness and what BPD feels like and how much it constantly hurts, probably in the vain hope they might hear what my parents never did.

I lay this all agonisingly bare, and importantly in a way that an observer might be able to reasonably understand it somewhat, which requires forming thoughts in to weak words that approximate the intensity of the BPD+CPTSD experience. As a consequence of doing this whilst also reading a couple of books, asking diagnosed people of their experiences, reading peer reviewed articles, credible websites and also reddit, I have started to make some progress. For example understanding how the limbic system works and especially the amygdala, recovering memories, reforming the ‘run riot’ day, learning about emotional flashbacks, the internal voids and the external void I feel, closing myself up from the world and the world from myself, understanding the inner and outer critic enough to notice what it is that they try to convince me of (e.g. that I am just being dramatic and should stop talking so openly in the chat room). Through introspection and honesty (I basically accused everyone of lying), I also described disorganised attachment before I even knew the term, so when I read about it, I knew it wholly applied to me. I have spiralled in the chat room a bunch of times, as in started allowing catastrophising thoughts to win, typically that they all just want me to shut up and leave, and that they were laughing about me secretly and were ‘just enjoying the clown show’. But they’ve chimed in a couple of times and said that was not the case. I don’t wholly believe them, but the affirmation helped a bit. 

Showing increasing levels of vulnerability (when I started this I didn’t even really share what music I liked), has made showing vulnerability that bit easier both online and offline. I do sometimes now actually go to my husband and cry when things are bad for example. Perhaps more importantly if he hears me, which during the most painful moments is perhaps inevitable assuming close enough proximity initially, he feels more able to come to me and provide comfort, which makes him feel less isolated, more involved and more useful.

I don’t know how much this is helping with trust yet, and I don’t know how much this is helping form a foundation for a sense of self, but as I said before, I am pretty sure both require showing up authentically, which by definition requires vulnerability, so given enough time perhaps they will come to even some small degree. Selfishly, if the loneliness decreases even 1% it will have been worth it.

Funny you should mention stopping going to meetings, I stopped too. My issues largely revolved around an inability to be wholly present due to self-image, feeling like their pain far outweighed my own, and their continued assertion that addiction was a disease. Addiction, at least for me, is not a disease; it is a symptom. As such it triggered me, because as I later came to realise, minimisation of problems flashes me back to all the times I was never helped by my parents. I recommend you introspect the pain you felt, and the confusion you felt, and try to get to the bottom of them. By introspect I mean question and challenge your own thoughts and feelings, especially about why you think or feel in a certain way.

After a few years of intense and dedicated healing, my conclusion is that you need to do things like go to therapy and dbt, build a reliable support system, and generally feel stable in life before you can really benefit from the use of psychedelics. Not saying you won't benefit otherwise, but for me the change was remarkable after I had laid the groundwork for me to truly benefit from psychedelic therapy. 

Doing psychedelics in the early stages of recovery helped me cry and feel some self love, for instance. But it didn't last as my mind wasn't yet structured in a way to sustain that feeling long term. Basically, psychedelics are not a silver bullet but they can help tremendously when used to assist other approaches to recovery.

17ycbuj,"Two things have helped me most:  

1. Psychodynamic psychotherapy. It's not a quick solution, but rewarding

2.  LSD therapy. It's also rewarding, but not easy.

Maybe I'm cynical, but I have a feeling that there's no easy way to resolve our relationships with the causes of our suffering and dysregulation. It's almost as if we contain measurable amounts of pain and effort that we need to expend. 

Think of it this way; ""I have 50 units of pain i need to drain off."" I can drain it all at once or very slowly, one unit at a time. If that metaphor doesn't work for you, think of a reservoir. A river is dammed and the outflow can be completely stopped. If you want to change the depth of the water and the pressure on the dam, you need to drain off water. It doesn't matter if you only let off a trickle or if you completely open the floodgates: the water needs to be drained in one way or another.

It was incredibly helpful for me to use psychedelics, but I can't recommend it to anyone. Psychodynamic therapy took much longer, but the pain was drained off thoroughly but much more slowly.

People say ""the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."" You need to take the first step, but the first step isn't the journey. You need to take the first step, and then the second first step, and the third first step, the fourth first step, and so on.

7 is a bit fuzzy.  we all need to take responsibility for our own emotions.  no body made us feel any way.  things happen, we feel feelings, sometimes we can help each other feel better. its subtle and important to that although we have feelings as a consequence of an event, its not appropriate to blame someone for your feelings, so it goes for both of you.  check out ""Nonviolent communication"" for more detail.

I struggled with this a lot (some days still do), but what I started doing is get into eye make up, especially eyeliner which will be destroyed if I cried. I started doing this around the time I was 19, and 8 yrs it has been working fine because if I think about the fact that if I cry it will be shown on my face the whole day from the make up smudging + waste the hour I've spent doing it, I manage to get myself together.

People who write in the BPD subreddits are usually not very healed, nor aware, and they project their own insecurities directly to people needing support and/or help with their black and white thinking. 

It’s not sustainable to keep another person responsible for your own feelings over so long time. Especially during morning and evening when it’s usually a “me time” for everyone. Our high pressure emotional needs, puts others needs way below our own, even when we don’t mean it. 

I think he do love you, why else would he be with you? I’ve practice to accept one good morning message, and one good night message. Sometimes, like once a week I need more and my husband has become great in handling those moments now. He wouldn’t have been able to, if we did like before; talk for hours and mainly focused on MY needs and emotions. I’m practicing to not put all my emotions on him. It’s not fair.

So yeah. Sometimes we ask questions to prove ourselves wrong, but if we're asking the wrong people, we'll get less than comforting answers. 

Honestly, part of what's difficult about ldr is not knowing what the other person's up to during their day (and I don't mean that negatively, like their automatically being shady, just living their life and being busy with normal stuff like getting groceries or in the shower or working or charging his phone or driving or hanging out with friends or family spur of the moment) and while he could be doing a little more to reassure you, ultimately it's YOUR responsibility to manage those creeping negative thoughts and feeling when they crop up.

17qa3mh,"Some important details to consider:

1. Did he himself *personally tell you* that's why he turns off his phone?
2. No one on the entire Internet can determine how much someone irl loves you. I'm sure the people you spoke with were trying to help, but ultimately, they can't telepathically know what he thinks/feels about you.
3. Did he himself *personally tell you* that's why he needs more space?
4. I want to tell you not to let what people say online to ""get to you,"" but we both know it's almost impossible not to be bothered by those things when you have BPD. Instead, I would try and be mindful about what information you decide to share to a bunch of strangers, especially if it's in a place where you know your situation may be judged harshly. Don't touch the hot stove, it's never worth it, I promise.
5. A'ight, take a deep breath. Based on what you've said, the people you spoke to did not at *all* say that he doesn't love you. Take what they said for what it is: ""he's not that into you."" It sucks to read, and it probably hurts you, but what they meant is that he may not love you *as much* as you love him. They're probably wrong, but regardless, they have literally acknowledged that, to some degree, he *does* love you. The idea that he doesn't love you at all is now completely off the table because no one thinks that but you. If he really wants to get married and raise a kid with you, it would make no sense for him not to love you. He wants you to move to his country and spend the rest of your life with him. He loves you. 
6. Now that we've established that he does, in fact, love you to some degree, why are you worried about how *much*? He clearly loves you ""enough"" to make a lifetime commitment to you. You *may* ""love"" him infinitely *more* than he loves you, but in the case of BPD, I wouldn't call it love: it's obsession. You love him *and* you're obsessed with him. He loves you, but he is not *obsessed* with you. There's nothing wrong with him *not* being obsessed with you; in fact, I'd argue that it says great things about y'all's future together. You're passionate and head-over-heels, and perhaps he's more down to earth and levelheaded. It's a dynamic as old as time, and as long as the both of you respect each other's boundaries, you're golden.

At least OP realized quickly and removed herself from the situation, which is the reason why OP's friends got mad according to the post (not for snapping back).

I agree that is not ideal, but we have to accept that human interactions are nuanced, complex and imperfect, and we don't always behave ideally, specially if we are still learning how to cope, emotionally regulate, etc., as OP is.

Holding oneself (and others) to such high standards is, imo, counterproductive, as it turns every awkward or hurtful interaction into a ""who is the asshole"" contest, when in reality, no one is the asshole or, rather, we are all little assholes sometimes. This is specially dangerous with BPD, in which this can lead to devaluating the other.

Called her brother in law and emptied her stuff from the house in two hours. I was shocked, destroyed on the inside, specially as I was an immigrant in her country so I felt completely alone. I went looking for her that afternoon so we could talk but she needed time.  


And so I did. I read at the time to create a small altar with all the mementos I had from our relationship and with this go to it once a day and empty my feelings. It helped a lot to also voice record any feelings I had and all the pain. Everything I would voice record it.  


A few weeks later she contacted me apologizing for leaving, saying she made a mistake for throwing our relationship away, that we didn't communicate and she reached a breaking point. We tried to reconnect but she kept giving deadlines herself ""I'll let you know before December if we're back together"" turned to ""I'll let you know by March if we get back together."" Eventually my situation became difficult living alone and went into therapy. Therapy made me realize I needed to move on with my life and not be awaiting for a decision from her. So I moved back to my home country.  


She ended up confessing she thought me leaving would be a relief for her but ended up throwing her deeper into sadness. I asked her if she'd move into my country and we could try be together again even if temporary (her job allowed her to take some months off).  


It never hapenned. 2 years on I moved on with my life, saved money, bought my own house and starting a new relationship with someone who seems to be more in line with me and my personality. Me and my ex we've been in contact, value what we got from our relationship but we're simply too different to work out.

Starting your day with exercise and bright light exposure when you feel that wave will reduce your cortisol (therefore stress) levels throughout the day.

 https://www.psychiatryisdrivingmemad.co.uk/post/autismnotpd-borderline-personality-disorder-vs-autism-spectrum-disorder

There is a lot of contention in the psychology/psychiatry fields internationally about this topic currently. It's a topic close to my heart as someone with chronic MH issues who initially was diagnosed with and identified with BPD, before eventually being diagnosed with ADHD/Autism and realising my experiences of growing up undiagnosed and unsupported, constantly invalidated by my parents and the wider world about my experiences, and having no tools to cope with my disabilities, explained my symptoms in a much better way for me. 

I was sure that BPD was the right diagnosis. I was vaguely aware of the discourse about Autism often being misdiagnosed as BPD, but didn't think it applied to me- I didn't know enough about autism and had masked so heavily for so long that I didn't recognise the traits in me. But when I had another breakdown last year and a psychiatrist review resulted in the recommendation for a full autism eval, I started to look into things more. At first I was still adamant that I wasn't autistic.

17kjxix,"Hi there, just wanted to say I hear what you're saying and validate your suffering. I apologise if this comes off as blunt but at the same time want to point out that many people with ASD/ADHD, especially if they were not diagnosed and supported as children, live with extreme feelings of worthlessness and feelings of being unloveable- because they have been made to feel that way by growing up in a world that continually punishes and rejects them. This is par the course for most adults with ADHD/Autism, especially women, who have typically not been diagnosed in childhood. Worthlessness and feeling unlovable is not a unique symptom of BPD: it's trans-diagnostic and commonly seen in any trauma or depressive presentation. 

Your comment arguing that comparing ASD/ADHD/BPD trivialises BPD could be interpreted as invalidating the pain that can occur with unsupported ADHD and ASD, if we flip it. I don't agree that comparing these three diagnoses trivialises the severity of BPD. There's studies showing that people with ADHD have a much higher risk of attempting as well as completing suicide than people without ADHD- one study shows that 25% of women with ADHD attempt suicide, and another shows tha 13 times more autistic women than non-autistic women die of suicide. Autism is an especially well known risk factor for suicide. 

ADHD and Autism can cause repeated inpatient admissions if unsupported- there are countless autistic people in psychiatric wards, often locked up against their will. And countless deaths of autistic people from suicide in psychiatric care.

It is important to compare diagnoses that have similar features. I was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago. I was sure this was the correct diagnosis for me as well. I have experienced enough suffering to be valid, I assure you: chronic repeated suicide attempts, self-harm, substance abuse, and all for 10 years +. But still I continued to struggle, despite DBT etc helping a little. 

Last year, I was diagnosed with ADHD, and then Autism earlier this year, and this is what has helped me start the long road to recovery finally. ADHD medications as well as learning how to accommodate for my autism and having therapy to deal with my chronic feelings of shame and worthlessness, related in part to growing up feeling like a rubbish person because I could not be like my neurotypical peers, have drastically reduced my ""BPD symptoms"". DBT skills training helped, antidepressants help with my depression/anxiety, but the ADHD/Autism diagnoses, support, and treatments are what have drastically reduced my emotional agony and destructive behaviours.

17kjxix,"Hi there, thanks for replying and I appreciate what you're saying. Sorry if my reply is quite long but I am really interested in this topic as it's a topic close to my heart so I find it useful to have these kind of discussions. 

I'm not denying that BPD symptoms are painful: I don't want that to be misconstrued and I'm sorry if it came off that way. My comment was not intended to invalidate the suffering that occurs when experiencing symptoms attributed commonly to BPD. What I am trying to do is delineate BPD symptoms from the diagnostic construct itself. The symptoms are real, but the discussion I'm trying to have is whether it can be helpful to conceptualise someone's difficulties differently by looking at difficulties which may fall under a BPD diagnosis, and by looking at the factors underlying these  symptoms, given that the symptoms are often rooted in trauma and/or undiagnosed/unsupported neurodivergence or other difficulties, hence why this post with the Venn diagram of overlapping symptoms exists. 

I am still technically diagnosed with BPD. I have experienced emotional agony to the point of serious self-harm and suicide attempts, often impulsive due to an interpersonal trigger, for most of my life. My symptoms are now drastically reduced however and I no longer identify with the diagnosis itself and find it more helpful to conceptualise my symptoms as a result of ADHD/Autism/Trauma, as addressing these root issues is what has helped the alleviation of my symptoms the most, and this is something many other people have experienced themselves on their own recovery journeys. My intention here is only to help by suggesting that people diagnosed with BPD may wish to look into similar diagnoses to access more help. 

There is no problem with identifying with BPD, it's just that it could be helpful to explore diagnoses with similar features, such as Autism/ ADHD/ cPTSD to access other treatments and support. It doesn't matter whether you decide to conceptualise them as commodities to your BPD or decide to conceptualise them in a different way i.e diagnoses to replace your BPD diagnosis, all that matters is that you can access the support and treatment that's right for you. It also is ok if you didn't identify with any of the similar diagnoses such as ADHD/autism/cPTSD and solely identify with BPD and only wish for BPD-specific treatment protocols. My intention here is only to try to help people expand their treatment options. 

For me, my Autism and ADHD diagnoses, and becoming aware of the trauma I experienced from my family and the wider world as I grew up undiagnosed, unsupported, invalidated, rejected, and abused in relation to these unrecognised disabilities, underpin all of the symptoms that were solely attributed to ""BPD"" and it is only through becoming aware of these and working through the underlying issues that my symptoms have started to alleviate. That is why I feel it is so important for everyone with a BPD diagnosis or exploring one to explore Autism/ADHD/cPTSD as well and see if these experiences would explain their symptoms better and unlock more specific treatments to help.

When my mental health symptoms were solely attributed to BPD, I had DBT etc as treatment. While the skills did help at the time, my life still felt like I was constantly treading water. I still was suffering massively and fell into a deep depression because I was so exhausted from fighting all the time. What I didn't realise at the time was that trying to use DBT skills to reduce my distress was always going to be a losing battle because I wasn't aware of where my distress was coming from: I was in the dark and fumbling around blindly. 

Trying to DBT skill my way through a vast swathe of complex, unrecognised issues associated with ADHD, Autism, and Trauma was like trying to put a wildfire out with a water gun. Now my underlying issues are recognised and I have the tools, medications, and therapy to treat and accommodate for them, I can use the DBT skills without feeling like I am always fighting a losing battle. If I remained solely diagnosed with BPD, I most likely would have died from suicide, as that was the point I was at before I saw a psychiatrist who identified possible autism. 

I'm not saying this just from personal experience- this is the personal experience of many people, especially late-diagnosed neurodivergent women, or women with cptsd, or quite often, women with all of the above. Many of whom have been harmed by this diagnosis and who have lost their lives due to neglect- in the UK for example we have many cases of this. Two women whose stories have stuck with me have been the cases of Zoe Zaremba and Lauren Bridges: both were diagnosed autistic women who were denied assistance with their autism and when they struggled with their mental health as a result, they were diagnosed with BPD, which they disagreed with, and consequently they were in and out of psychiatric hospitals with suicide attempts and self-harm, their disabilities unrecognised, dismissed, and unsupported in lieu of the BPD diagnosis. 

Their pain was real and they deserved support for their autism, which was at the root of their difficulties but doctors instead attributed them to BPD and they were not given the specialist support they needed and asked for many times. Unfortunately they never got the support and both died by suicide. They are far from the only ones unfortunately. The idea of exploring ADHD/Autism/Trauma as contributors to or causes of BPD symptoms is increasingly being recognised by a growing number of psychiatrists and psychologists.",Familiar_Violinist69,False,1698940510.0
17kjxix,"Also, Marsha Linehan's bio-social theory posits that BPD symptoms arise from interactions between a child with innate emotional sensitivity and the invalidating environment. A neurodivergent child has innate emotional sensitivity- autistic and ADHD brains are emotionally sensitive biologically as part of the nature of these neurodevelopmental conditions. And a neurodivergent child lives in a society which is inherently invalidating. BPD symptoms are likely to result, but it could be more helpful to address the cause of the symptoms rather than trying to treat the symptoms from a BPD framework and that's what I think is important for anyone looking at these diagnoses to explore so they can access the best treatment for them. 

For ADHD, emotional dysregulation, especially anger and irritability and impulsivity (key BPD symptoms as well) is becoming more and more well known as a core symptom. Rejection sensitivity is also being studied as something associated with ADHD. Emotional dysregulation is also prevalent in autism, especially in autistic females, for a number of reasons including black and white thinking (again commonly associated with BPD), sensory overload and meltdowns, obsessive thinking styles, alexithymia/ difficulty in identifying emotions, communication and relationship difficulties related to social difficulties intrinsic to autism which then result in difficult relationship experiences etc, as well as neurology involving the amygdala.

So you take an autistic/ADHD child with innate emotional sensitivity and you have them grow up in a world which is not equipped to recognise, understand, or support this innate emotional sensitivity and unique emotional needs.  This child will often grow up feeling misunderstood, rejected by others, taken advantage of others etc. Autistic people are much more likely to experience abuse than non-autistic people and studies show this.This child will accrue a number of labels over time such as ""sensitive"", ""dramatic"" due to their innate emotional sensitivity. They will lose their sense of self because they cannot learn to trust their emotions as they are constantly denied and invalidated by parents, friends, teachers etc. They will feel ashamed and unsure of who they are when they learn to mask their autistic traits- autistic masking is an increasingly researched phenomenon on its own and as a risk factor for suicide.

So naturally emotionally sensitive ADHD/autistic child + invalidating environment of the whole world not meeting their unique emotional needs fits perfectly into Linehan's bio-social theory of BPD as an explanation for BPD symptoms.

With ADHD/autism/trauma you can end up with a soup of symptoms that could be attributed to BPD but wouldn't be getting to the root of the symptoms. I.e with ADHD alone you have emotional dysregulation, low frustration tolerance and outbursts of anger and rage, impulsivity and a predilection for risky, reckless and destructive behaviours such as substance abuse and addiction, binge eating etc. That covers 3 BPD criteria from the DSM: paraphrasing but 1) impulsive self destructive behaviours not including SH/suicide 2) Explosive anger 3) Emotional lability/dysregulation.

With autism, you add more fuel to the emotional dysregulation criterion and explosive anger criterion- the extremity of irritability in autism is well-known, hence why certain antipsychotic medications are licensed for treatment of autism-associated irritability. You can also add in for both ADHD/ Autism for criterion 4) unclear/unstable self-image e.g shifting goals- ADHD because part of it is naturally gaining and losing intense focus on an ever-changeable conveyor belt of hobbies and ideas, and Autism because if you've grown up learning to mask your autism, you are going to feel lost and like you have no sense of self because you won't know you are anymore! 

Consequently, Criterion 5) chronic feelings of emptiness is linked to this- autistic masking to the point of losing your whole self is going to make you feel empty.  Loneliness and isolation and feeling different to everyone / ""like an alien"" as an autistic person is going to make you feel empty, lost, and disconnected. Add depression in, which is highly comorbid with both ADHD and Autism, and those feelings of emptiness are going to be even stronger. Add trauma in with dissociation, and there's another explanation for feelings of emptiness. Trauma and dissociation can also cover Criterion 6)- dissociative experiences under stress and paranoia. Intense autistic stress can also lead to shutdowns rather than meltdowns which can involve some level of dissociation and shutting down completely. 

The last 3 DSM criteria for BPD are unstable relationships, fear of abandonment, and self harm/suicide. Firstly, criterion 7)- repeated self-harm and suicide. Both these things are trans-diagnostic and not exclusive to BPD. Chronic depression can lead to chronic self-harm. Trauma is associated strongly with self harm. Studies show that ADHD and Autism are both independently associated with higher rates of self-harm than the general population. Then criterion 8) Fear of abandonment- attachment difficulties like these are often related to trauma of any interpersonal/attachment kind. But also autistic people are very likely to experience repeated rejection, abuse, bullying, and abandonment  throughout their life- that would make anyone fear abandonment. Furthermore, rejection sensitivity is being studied currently as part of the ADHD presentation. 

Then criterion 9)Unstable relationships- again, if you have attachment trauma of any kind, you're likely to experience relational difficulties like these. Plus social difficulties are intrinsic to autism- these social difficulties don't occur in a vacuum , they play out in real life in real relationships, leading to losing friends and experiencing the abandonment trauma that plays into a fear of abandonment and consequential unstable relationships. The very nature of gaining and losing friends frequently can be seen in autistic people due to social difficulties and this can be seen as unstable relationships. The ""double empathy"" problem whereby non-autistic and autistic people struggle to understand and relate to each other in the same way is going to lead to conflict, misunderstandings, and unstable relationships in many cases- I've found that to be the case in my family, and my relationships with family are more stable than ever now we all understand autism/ADHD and how it affects our communication with each other.

So, in moments like these, where you were for example muted, it is obvious that your fear of abandonment was something, that was completely unreasonable because the Partner couldn’t possibly have acted on it (not saying the other episodes are reasonable).
So in those instances your rational thinking tells you that theres nothing going on, and satisfies that fear with your logical brain.
However, when the emotional need of reassurance is dominating, it does not matter if the need is satisfied, because there is no logical process behind it. Because there was no reason, that should’ve been fixed.

I’m so well regulated that he never picked up on the small irritating things and it was just whatever to me anyways. This time he said I was being rageful which made me laugh because frankly yeah I was mad but rage is not something you should literally say idc then get mad. I just find the stigma of how crazy we can be so obnoxious but on the flip side if we do the right thing and get help, it does require the assistance of loved ones. I truly think he has zero clue the deep layers BPD effects and is not the type to want to hear it. So be it. I feel way better about it today. Validated a little. It was an insensitive way to let me know I matter only as far as his mood in that moment. 

And on a super venty note: don’t piss on my leg and tell me it’s raining, that was aggression and not passion. And it’s intimidating af to someone who was kept in line through aggressive yelling and shaming since childhood. I brushed it off but he knows these things about me and should respect it. In conclusion, I feel good about blocking him now abs I’m glad I took the opportunity to call out how I have some years on him and a decade of therapy and experience, so it’s pretty arrogant to believe his emotional intelligence is superior to Mine. I certainly never thought that before this incident. He brought ugly outta me. Scared me.",,False,1698267916.0
17fk3tz,"Philosophical counseling has been fantastic for me. I had a very long and abusive relationship that stripped me of who I was, and the last time I remember feeling anything pleasant so strongly was on campus with my classmates and professors learning about and reading philosophical texts. I remember feeling inspired and actually had hope for the future. I lose that in the relationship. This counselor is absolutely reminding me that girl wasn’t a fever dream, I was at one point filled a fire and light when learning about and reading the texts of scholars questioning what we know and exploring the unanswerable questions. I loved it so much. If you’re going back to college for a bachelors in it, while I recommend it I must say: graduate school is an absolute necessity if you want to do anything with it. I also knew quite a few double majors. One did philosophy and psych and has been a social worker that deals with helping troubled kids. A masters and a separate certification will give you the ability to do philosophical counseling, and a PhD opens up the door to being a philosophy professor. Career prospects not impressive, but with the counseling as long as you can build a client base you could probably survive on it. A BA in philosophy is so much more useful than employers will give it credit for. I could totally sell the skills I learned but you’d need the interview first. So yes absolutely encourage a formal education in philosophy but don’t count on that alone. I wish I double majored! 

I see what your saying about that distinction between possibility vs reality. I decided that after what he had said to me I would need the change to even consider letting him back in. It’s not safe. However, I typically feel the same re: it’s not our job to teach or try to prevent their fuckups but i believe my job is supporting no matter what and if they fail to help them back up. But this friend is not one I am willing to do that for any longer due to his dismissal and inability to see past himself (which leads me to believe he would not do the same for me). My stability matters more than trying to discuss with him how to avoid my life-altering mistakes. 

Anyways [this the National Philosophical Counselors Association](https://npcassoc.org)

And [this is who I see](https://philosophyandzen.com). She is based in Florida but does FaceTime sessions. Idk how into astrology and card readings you are but it’s pretty powerful for me. She read my birth chart, and she does oracle card readings before every session. We do a chakra meditation to end. She has sent me copies from a book by the the author of my favorite fictional novel, though this is a textbook he wrote. It’s called Existential Psychotherapy, and it’s the one written by Irvin D. Yalom. Sartre also has one though I have not read it yet. She may have chosen this book based on my love of Yalom but so far I’ve found the two readings (the intro and the chapter on death) absolutely fantastic. He has a very accessible writing style as well, which is not a trait philosophy is known for lol. She also had me reread the allegory of the cave before my first session. I feel very much spiritually fulfilled and I’ve only just started. It isn’t for everyone but I love recommending it because a study in philosophy is a really good way to explore yourself abstractly first and the parts that resonate you can find parts of your life to explore within the framework of what you just read. What I love most about philosophy though, you don’t have to believe it to understand it. And you only need understanding of it to pull from it things that may help. Idk I’m just an absolute nerd because this shit has powerful thought exploration.

I also recommend reading The Schopenhauer Cure by Yalom. It’s one of his fictional novels. I love it cause I love Schopie so much…dude is tattooed on my arm. I sort of identify with him and his work was 1) the first to bring a bit of eastern thought into western works and 2) vastly under appreciated while he was alive, but he was a major influence on niestzche (sp?) and frued. Einstein had a bust of him on his desk. Majorly important in the neverending  philosophical discussion but in life he was known to be a cantankerous jerk. His own mother once wrote him (paraphrase) “you’d be fine if you weren’t the way you are but you are so you’re pretty unpleasant”. Along that vibe, don’t know off the top of my head. So many stories about his bad attitude but all I see is a misunderstood dude whose life work was trying to transcend the will’s neverending quest for more and more (which leads to disappointment only because once you achieve the goal you want more still). He believed art could help transcend the will’s desires and provide temporary relief. The book I mentioned is about a therapy group, mortality, and closure. But also about more too I’m just so tired I don’t want to type it out lol. Talking about my Schopie exhausted me. But I can’t recommend it more. It’s my most reread and cherished book that I own. [here’s a link to the Amazon listing with a summary ](https://www.amazon.com/Schopenhauer-Cure-Novel-Irvin-Yalom/dp/0060938102?nodl=1&dplnkId=941d3e53-ae9a-40ca-8d51-cbb7a1b36c4c). 

Anyway sorry for all that I just get excited. If you’re interested you can dm me your email and I can send over the two readings I’ve had so far, and the ones she sends out in the future if you want. But truthfully it’s so affordable, much more than my previous therapist, and I already feel almost human again.",,False,1698227848.0

I know what I'm about to say might sound a bit harsh, but I believe it's necessary. You are not crazy, and you are not wrong for feeling jealous. He is clearly cheating on you with this woman for a long time, and he won't stop.

  
He makes it very obvious that you are not his priority and that he cares much more about her when he easily blocks you but refuses to block her. Also, when instead of consoling you after your dog's death, he goes to her house drunk and spends the night there.

  
Your boyfriend is very likely in love with this woman for years, and she probably doesn't want a serious relationship with him, which is why he keeps you as a second option. But whenever she calls, he abandons you and rushes to her. All the things he says about her forcing herself on him and being in love with him are lies. **HE is in love with her.**

  
Unfortunately, he will never stop talking to her, even if you get married, have children, or even move to another country. Because in my opinion, the one he truly loves is her.

  
I know how difficult it is to let someone you love so much go, especially for us with borderline personality disorder. It feels like a piece of us is forcibly torn away, and it hurts a lot. **But you deserve someone who truly loves you, someone who loves you completely and respects you.**

  
You seem like an incredible person and are trying to be a better girlfriend and a better person. You deserve someone who puts in the same effort for you and doesn't treat you in this horrible way.

  
I know it will be very difficult to break up with him, but it's worth it. When you look back in a year, you will thank your past self.

175yhrw,"Thank you so much.

Anytime I feel anger or have to end a relationship that I view is harming me I feel a lot of guilt and shame at first. I struggle with knowing when I'm allowed to be angry (I keep it on a very controlled leash) because of having BPD and some people immediately going, ""Oh she has anger issues and everything is an attack if you talk to her!"" when it's not and everyone else in my support circle sees that. Instead now my anger comes out when I feel like I've been greatly disrespected and it 100% comes out over my kids and husband when they are targeted. 

I haven't had to end a lot of relationships or friendships. Conviently enough the relationships I ended were due to be too toxic and recognizing that their behaviors influenced me too and caused me to develop bad habits that took me years to break in my late teens/early 20s. Despite the guilt, each time I've removed these people from my life I've grown more in my recovery which is helping me fight against it.",WanderingFoxWitch,True,1697119796.0

Basically the main also thing is to get rid of the environment that's troublesome. For many that's their parents household because they've faced neglect or abuse.

Not much other that I can say. If you're not in a relationship I'd advice for you to wait til you're recovered enough in therapy before starting one. BPD can be quite damaging for both you and your partner.

Other that that, work to recognize what it is you're feeling and why. And then communicate it without confrontation or accusations. And remember that you're just human - you'll make mistakes. And as long as you owe up to them, apologize and work on them, it's okay!

174f4je,"As someone with PTSD, is it possible that your wife may have PTSD? Having nightmares about past events is not uncommon and often us with BPD have a very traumatized past.

Maybe there is something there that she hasn't processed yet. Maybe it's her brain's way or telling her that there's something she hasn't gone through yet.

I know for me, I used to get these nightmares about my sister after her untimely death. In my dreams she had miraculously gotten resurrected, much to my family's absolute delight. I was the only one who knew that she was not truly alive and was some sort of a zombie that was decaying from the inside. In my dreams I was desperately trying to keep her alive so my parents would not be devastated again.

I had to truly stop and pause with my therapist on these dreams. What did they truly mean, what was my brain trying to process while I was sleeping? Was it the traumatizing event where I had to personally tell my parents that their first born had died? Was it the fact that I had to shoulder all of the regret and guilt that my sisters death had caused my parents to feel? Was it the fact that I hadn't fully yet accepted she was gone?

Dreams as they are, they might not have a clear meaning. But my dreams subsided once I actually started to discover what they meant and started to actively process them.

In addition, some really powerful sleep meds can impact your sleep in a way that it's too deep to dream. It affects the quality of sleep overall, but will probably get rid of the nightmares. I advice possibly seeking out a psychiatrist.

17312wh,"Here are my top things that helped me more than anything else to better respond to my emotions, including rage:
- mindfulness - i went to a course of MBSR, it is 8 weeks long and helps you work to distance yourself from the mind, and get some wiggle room while experiencing emotions. There are online ones. If you cant afford it I recommend reading ""Full catastrophe living"" by J Kabat Zinn, who has invented this course. Also, there are relatively cheaps apps like Headspace which base on it.
- particularly for rage I recommend reading some  books from Lowen's body work therapy. It is powerful thing and sometimes can be health hazard (e.g. For heart or blood pressure, so should be practiced with therapists or practicioners
- in general getting into a healthy routine helps you cause it gives your body fuel to withstand pressure, so gym, sleeping schedule, getting sunlight after walking up, good diet, supplementation of magnesium and others, are good for you
- there are DBT workbooks for patients and they provide a lot of useful skills for emotion resillience and coping
- generally planning your stay at your family with some clear goals (saving, budgeting, having clear steps for a crisis, like a plan whom to call, where to stay,somewhere on a piece of paper) will be helpful for you to get through this period 
-understanding your boundaries and treating living with the family as exercise is a good strategy - write down what is non negotiable for you and if it happens you need a strategy to get through it. Also write down what is just annoying, but is not a hill youd die at. For example, abuse is a no go- you need a place to stay if it happens and it should be agreed in advance. Mom being annoying about a tattoo - can be just a situation to practice setting a boundary and taking care of yourself. Just examples from the top of my head
-in general if you have a lot of emotions, self care, and feeling your endorphins is important. So planning nice little pleasures. Every day you do something nice for youself - a Bath, a mindful breakfast, a meeting with a friend. Practice paying as much attention to it as you can, squeeze it as a lemon. Then if you feel like you are losing control, try to remember this moment from the day or the previous day.
-deep breathing. This is understated. It is something that dissolves your emotions in second. Deep breathe for 3-5 secs into your belly. Then release breathout for 5-7 secs. Slowly feel like your feelings go away with this. Schedule a phone reminder to do it 3 times  here and there during a day. Helps to not have too much emotions built up.

172ngc8,"Hi, congrats on your new labels! I have both BPD and ADHD dxes. To me, they are both a set of maladaptive behaviours rooted in impulsivity and difficulty self-regulating. Behaviours associated with BPD tend to manifest in extreme emotional and relational disregulation, and are often thought to be developed through trauma. ADHD behaviours tend to manifest more as executive dysfunction (being late, trouble keeping a job). Learning about ADHD helped me manage my BPD symptoms, and vice versa.

You’re a human, with your own unique intrinsic value. These labels can help you better understand and recognize behaviour patterns within yourself, help you access treatment and support, help you connect with other people who struggle with similar issues. Or they can mean whatever else feels right for you. Plenty of people no longer meet the diagnostic criteria for BPD after therapy and/or later in life.

Hope this helps!",anaugustleaf,False,1696739407.0
172ngc8,"I received my diagnosis early last year at age 21. BPD with histrionic & aspd traits with schizoid as well as schizotypal features. I always knew there was something going on in regards to emotional regulation. Pretty much knew by the time I was 20 that I would meet the criteria for BPD after being in a relationship with someone who had BPD and how much we were alike as well as learning how to be a supportive partner in that case. Also currently going through testing for ADHD which is interesting, puts all the hyperfixations into a bit more of a context at least. As well as a lot of the executive dysfunction.

As for how to be a human, no fucking idea. Always the popular but odd one out. At the end of the day we're all just floating on a rock living in our own tiny worlds.

I will say being obsessed with the label for a while is probably going to be helpful so you have a solid foundation of understanding. I did that, and then afterwards I begun primarily just focusing on what symptoms are affecting me and not necessarily the labels. For example currently I’m focusing what it is in my behaviour that makes friendships and relationships unstable over time and why people keep falling in love with me. (No need to call me a siren, witch or banshee, heard that enough by now.) Which could both be attributed to BPD and HPD traits but it’s the symptoms that are causing problems at the end of the day.

Also just accepting that yeah there are abnormal things I have to deal with meaning I just walk the road less traveled and thus for better or worse can't live a boring life like most people.

Medication is also worth trying, it can be immensely helpful. Having been on lamictal (a mood stabilizer) for 6 months gave me more breathing room to focus on my other symptoms. I am currently tapering off of it due to side effects that only recently began, and so many things are more difficult than they need to be again. And that’s okay. The world didn’t end though and I’ll be trying out lithium and ritalin or concerta after I’m done tapering.

The way I look at things is that everyone has a backpack with rocks, people with bpd just have more rocks in their backpack.In short what has helped me most has been people, group therapy, discipline, nutrition, exercise and radical acceptance. Especially just coming to terms with how dark the abyss can be one moment and how ethereal life can be the next. Most people won’t experience that, so generally I feel alone in that regard, just having one person that gets that though really makes a difference so I try to always have at least one person where there isn’t anything to hide. So I hope you have someone like that. I didn’t plan on being on this planet or having BPD but I’m gonna make what I can of it. I don’t think I would wish to be without the intensity it brings and the older I get the easier the waves become to glide across.

This became longer than expected, oh well. Anyways, I do wanna ask how important the label is to you? Or whether there’s anything in particular about BPD that is troublesome?

172n0lf,"Thanks for the response :) 

And mania/manic episodes can absolutely be a symptom of BPD. However, it can be expressed in ways different than the mania you might be familiar with (such as in bipolar disorder). You probably know that mood swings and overall emotional instability are some of the major symptoms of BPD. On the high highs of those, someone could be considered to be experiencing mania or even a manic episode. 

DSM-5 defines a manic episode as ""A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently goal-directed behavior or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).""

Oxford Languages defines mania as ""mental illness marked by periods of great excitement or euphoria, delusions, and overactivity,"" which is perhaps a more everyday use of the term. 

I suppose I could see your argument if you're saying that mania isn't a symptom of BPD since the mood swings rarely last a week or more and thus it doesn't meet DSM diagnostic criteria. However, I think that'd be misguided for a few reasons. 1) It invalidates the struggles of pwBPD who do experience manic symptoms and require treatment that acknowledges them. 2) It makes it harder for people like me to openly talk about their experiences, ask questions, and create a dialogue in general. Over 'clinicalizing' a word like mania forces people to either not speak or use less specific language (most of the time they don't speak out of fear of being wrong). And the ones left who do choose to speak are on either extreme, experts who are extremely passionate about the topic in question and people who don't know much about the topic and aren't concerned about the quality of information they put out. To be honest. I think I'm somewhat in the middle. I'm certainly not an expert but I also care deeply about what I say and how it's perceived. 

I'll end this by sharing my own experience of mania in relation to BPD. It often goes hand in hand with the idealization/devaluation process (also known as 'splitting'). It also is strongly tied to my sense of identity. After a period of time when my identity feels extremely unstable or not there at all (usually very painful, depressive, and suicidal) I'll experience a subsequent period/episode of identity reconstruction and a feeling of mania (Oxford languages definition). It doesn't last a week but goddamn for those few hours or days, I am a completely different person. Euophic as fuck, sometimes paranoid, absurdly inspired/creative, and overactive by all definitions of the word. Often losing sleep, not eating, and making unreasonable commitments in the process.

So yes, pwBPD can have mania.",NoahDC8,True,1696976685.0

Working with the public is tough, especially when you have BPD. On the one hand, a lot of us enjoy helping people and creating genuine connections. On the other, we often have days where our own emotions make dealing with people feel impossible. Maybe you would be happier in a job that is less public facing, or maybe in time you will develop better skills for managing your emotions. Personally, I’ve worked in a lot of fields and the year I spent as a cabinetmaker was pretty freaking chill.

16w9liz,"My mom passed away recently after being diagnosed with a similar but much more quick moving lung disease. She would have died in six months after her diagnosis but she got a double lung transplant and actually lived for 2.5 more years before going into to rejection and passing away.

I cared for my mom for the three years before she passed - and let me tell you - she constantly felt guilty for being a burden and wanted to do things on her own, and the one thing I WISHED she had done, was tell me when she needed help. I always had to read through her insisting that she didn’t need it and that I should go on with my life - it was confusing for me, because I wished she would just allow me to be there for her. But she would cover up her pain and suffering so I could “be free of her” but really… I was happy to be there for her, because I loved her. 

It was hard for me to be a caregiver, yes. I was unhappy a lot, yes. She was difficult and it was a trying time. But I LOVE her. I WANTED to help her. I was GRATEFUL to be there for her. 

This really opened my eyes as a BPD person to when I push people away because I don’t want to “bother” them with “my troubles”. 

You’re about to embark on a difficult journey - and if your boyfriend wants to stay with you, then LET HIM. ALLOW him to love you!

It’s his choice. Do you respect him? Let him make his choice, and then respect it. If he wants to stay with you, it’s not your move to doubt him. Trust his ability to make the right choice for himself, and allow him to be there for you if he wants to be.

Through the three years I had living with my mom, there were these rare moments when she would let me in. She would tell me how scared she was, or we would lie in the dark and cry together about how hard things were. There were many happy days and moments together too - watching love is blind together and yelling at the TV, going through crazy situations together like when she spilled a poop sample in the car and we just died laughing while driving with all the windows down in the middle of the fucking snowy freezing winter. The way she would wake up and bring me coffee every morning even though walking was hard for her and would make her out of breath. 

Those moments of connection and togetherness were amazing for me, and it was frustrating that I had to constantly push back against her denials of wanting help, to force her to accept help, which would allow those connecting moments to come. 

By pushing him away you are not only getting rid of the difficulty, but you are also robbing the both of you of possibly many years of connection and closeness. COPD usually is slow moving and is not debilitating for a long time - it is possible for the two of you to have many very happy years together before things get really hard.

Lung transplants are also often very successful on younger people. My mom was older and in fragile condition - but many people will go on to live 15 years+ after a transplant, living a relatively normal life.

No matter what happens, you have to allow someone to care for you. I suggest getting s therapist asap because this shit is hard. I wish my mom would have had someone who would help her open up to me during that time. I wanted so badly to be let in on her experience, so I could be there WITH her.

I have the BPD symptoms mostly under control due to DBT, and I was just concerned about my psychiatrist not seeing the damaging behaviours from my “up” state (lack of sleep, increase in energy, talking too much, obsessing over topics, lack of empathy, taking on a lot of tasks both in my personal and professional life, hypersexual, impulsive in spending reckless driving etc, and generally super euphoric but I can get irritable when I feel “slowed down” as I’m basically like the energizer bunny on coke LOL). Regardless, my psychiatrist reassured me that we’re continuing mood stabilizers and antipsychotics which seem to be helping more and more with the dosage increase!

Edit: I forgot to add that my psych and I agreed last appointment that I do have psychosis, in terms of both vivid hallucinations and delusions of grandeur. He’s hesitant to diagnose adhd meds for reasons of “becoming manic” too. I think he’s mostly reluctant to officially diagnose, but is treating the symptoms",,False,1698994592.0

Your relationship reminds me of my marriage. I was the more unstable one and was convinced that I would kill myself if she ever left me. Eventually I left her and didn't kill myself, in fact I worked on myself and got a lot better. I'm still not where I'd like to be but I'm doing much better than I was then. That's possible for both of you too. 

It sounds to me like you are a very convenient scapegoat for your partner. I think you both would be doing better if you weren't in a relationship with each other.

16ru3ms,"When your body is flooded with adrenaline it generally will be ineffective to try and sit down and meditate or purely rely on breathing techniques to get us back. Once in sympathetic (fight, flight, freeze), we need to use certain tools to get our biology back towards the parasympathetic side (rest and digest). One of those tools is to fill a pot with water and ice and plunge your face in for 1 minute. It triggers the mammalian dive reflex which causes your heart rate to slow down and reduces that adrenaline and creating a parasympathetic response. If that’s not your cup of tea ( though I highly recommend trying it before you knock it), then high intensity workout for 10-15 minutes, burpees, wall sits, jumping jacks and sprints. Now after you’ve used some distress tolerance skills your emotional regulation tools are more effective.

16qze39,"I would advise Dragon Age: Origins for one of the best fantasy RPG's. Another good one is the Witcher 3 and Skyrim. You do quests and have an adventure! There's also 'movie' type games where your choices dictate the outcome of the game (Detroit: Become Human, Beyond: Two Souls, The Walking Dead series)

Then there's multi-player fantasy RPG's like World of Warcraft (subscription based), Final Fantasy XIV (free-ish), Tera (free), New World (one time payment). In these you search for a community to play in and seek to play with a bunch of people. You get to choose what it is you want to do and what you don't, so it's pretty relaxed! As there's other people though there can be some drama. 

Then there's shooter games like Counter Strike, Apex Legends, Valorant, Overwatch 2 (I recommend overwatch 2 if you're interested in shooter games but never tried). However those can definitely be stressful and they do have a sort of a time limit so if you're not looking for anything too intense I wouldn't suggest shooter games. They do distract you very well, but it does have the side effect of being frustrating sometimes haha. 

There's also looaaaads of games based on your favorite TV-shows, anime, cartoon etc whatever you like to watch. My personal favorite one is Okami, it's a cute little wolf who has to save the world! It's got loads of Japanese folklore in it. If you wanna ease into it with good vibes, an amazing story and beautiful scenery I'd definitely recommend that one. Shouldn't be too pricey, either.

It's also really easy to get in some casual, low effort/commitment socializing which is nice to help with distractions when you need them. You can play as casually as you want-- almost all main story content can be completed alone and the few things that are multi-player (crystal tower I believe) is very easy and the community is used to newbies being in almost every run. The game has so much content there'll always be something for you to do when you need a task to focus on 

There is also Palia as far as mmos that's releasing soon but in open beta atm-- limited character customization but plenty of story/exploration/quest to do and you can decorate a house or date npcs 

If you have a switch then I recommend breath of the wild amd/or tears of the kingdom for a single player game, it's open world so there's tons to occupy you and the difficulty isn't too high. You can simply skip the shrines you don't like.

 If no switch genshin impact is similar in exploration although the gacha aspect is something you may or may not be able to tolerate-- there's no need to ever buy anything though, the game is easy and with patience and planning you can save up free wishes to guarantee a character you like. The free characters are really enough though and you can switch your main characters element to whatever you'd need-- you can simply run to whichever region you need to swap since genshin has a world level system meaning you can control what lvl the enemies are

16pmakg,"I'm gonna be that guy here:
I think we have to reframe our thinking on BPD. We can't necessarily control it - I think this thinking leads to self harm and self medication through substances and validation and trying to control it leads to loss of self for the sake of the partner. All we can do is ensure we're not reacting with our emotional response out of control and hurting people. Over time you'll get better at recognizing when you're disregulated and what you need to do to regulate yourself. 

It's hard. Very hard to learn. But we are tough cookies in our right, just in different way than most can see and you will be able to heal and get better at dealing with and coping with your bpd and learn to live a more stable life! Takes time, patience and work. 

Remember, just because you have to be patient with yourself doesn't mean others have to be. So when people decide to take a break with you, remember, you are on your path, and to learn from your experiences. Ego is huge with validation. It is part of your growth 

During episode:
Separate yourself from your emotion, inspect it, understand it, and then connect with it again and try to work with it. Communicate about the emotion. You will feel silly likely doing so. And often the partner isn't able to appropriately assist in understanding our disregulation, nor should they have to. It is our job to work on our disregulation for the most part with a professional, barring exceptions of course. 

So I'll say, to work on it you should find a therapist who specializes in BPD or one that is willing to work with you, learn dbt, learn how to recognize episodes and dysregulation as first steps. Learn about your hobbies and what makes you, you. Journal about it. Try to identify who you are and remind yourself during disregulation. Do things you enjoy during disregulation (you may not enjoy it at that moment, but you gotta try to get out of that emotional reactive mindset).

The rest sorta comes with time and action (mistakes, unfortunately).



A good example for myself, is when I've been catering too much to my partner I find that I become more upset easily because Im losing my identity.  Not sure if that relates at all, but a point of comparison for why I would think about who I am as a person and my hobbies.

16pmakg,"I think you should listen to your instincts here. In many case, having a relationship IS the trigger for many of the challenging mental and behavior issues associated with BPD.

If you feel these behaviors only show up in a relationship then yeah, that makes a lot of sense. In the right situation, BPD is manageable outside of a relationship and people can lead reasonably balanced lives.

Out of a relationship, a person with BPD may not even display enough criteria to be diagnosed with BPD, as if the criteria lies dormant until a relationship starts, until that feeling of falling in love hits. It is really a mixed bag and every person is different.

That doesn’t mean BPD wasn’t impacting family, friendships and other aspects of life before, it is just people have a way of rationalizing and just making things work.

When a relationship starts, that is when things could potentially get harmful for everyone and escalate beyond one’s imagination; especially when people are not aware of the potential diagnosis, educating themselves and seeking treatment.

I commend you on seeing a therapist and challenging yourself to learn more. You should be proud of yourself, it is a massive step.

This could be a very big opportunity for you. All the behaviors you are bravely describing about yourself are, frankly, dysfunctional and not the basis of a healthy relationship. However, the relationship itself has given you the opportunity to recognize something you may have been low-key dealing with for a long time and maybe making excuses for and not doing anything about.

That is the space I feel you need to spend a lot of time reflecting on.

To simply tell you to stop behaving in the dysfunctional ways that you have described is almost meaningless when those behaviors are driven by a behavioral disorder and deeply ingrained trauma in your neuron network.

This is not to imply you do not have control. The implication is more you do not have mindful awareness in these moments. Everything just seems right and justified at the time. With treatment, you learn to identify in real time the emotional states and impulses that lead to the unwanted behavior and better manage it over time.

It is a lot of work unfortunately and you are ultimately responsible, even if you feel overwhelmed and not in control at times. You’re asking the right questions and learning now so there is no going back, but know the investment in yourself will be worth it for you and everyone who loves you.

No matter what, if you feel you are not in control of the individual behaviors, you are in control of making the choice to step back from the relationship out of love for yourself and your partner and to seek treatment, such as DBT, and be mindful of your behavior and triggers as you step back into a relationship after treatment.

With that said, you have not technically been diagnosed with BPD so keep learning and continue to be as honest with yourself as you can about your behavior.

I also was in a relationship where I was forced to have sex, for 3 long years. I also pretended it was amazing while crying for hours afterwards. It took a very special person who I opened up to, to say 'whoa, that is not normal'. 

It didn't work out with that person, but it did teach me a lot. I am currently with my loving fiancé, and despite having been traumatized to shit and unable to be involved in sexual actions at all, I am now actually comfortable with him and even like it.

The key is to first be able to trust your partner and push through your fear. But if it's unpleasant _always, always say no_. Consent can be withdrawn at any point, and **NEVER** let anyone do something you don't like. Faking things is an absolute no. 

The second key is, if your partner gets upset over you withdrawing consent or not having sex... 
#RED FLAG 
Instant break up. Hell no. Trash rapists. 

And lastly... It's okay. It's okay to not want sex. I'm asexual, and while I'm generally sex positive, there are a lot of us who do not have sex. They thrive, have relationships and live normal life. It is not mandatory, if you just don't want it anymore, _you don't have to_. 

Sexless relationships are not for everyone, but there is always a work around, always a solution or a compromise everyone's happy with, if both parties are determined enough.

Oh, and most definitely seek therapy.",Melthiela,False,1695388103.0

That's not okay. It's not okay to be upset over that, it's not okay to push the issue if met with hesitancy. He even knew you wanted to wait to have sex!

16p97a1,"It's okay to not like it, but if you do want to try it again, there's two pieces of advice.

Do not try it forcefully, buy lubrication. If you are using condoms (which you should, always), make note that it's water or silicon based. **Oil based lubrication can break the condom!**

It will hurt without proper lubrication, and seeing as you are generally anxious, maybe it's better to buy it online?

Second piece of advice is, it will get better in time. After a while it stops hurting, but it might feel... Underwhelming. Honestly, I started when I was 17. I'm now 24 and it's beginning to actually feel like something. For women it gets time to actually learn what to do and what feels good.

The main thing is, do not do it, if you feel any kind of obligation, pressure or other kind of forced feelings. That's an immediate sign that you are overstepping your own boundaries. Destroying your mental health is NEVER a worthy sacrifice for someone else.

To me it sounds like you are trying to blame this all on yourself so hard, you even contradicted what you said earlier! You're not to blame. You did nothing wrong, you felt pressured. It's clear from everything you say.

It doesn't mean that he was a bad person or didn't love you. He's young, didn't understand and didn't think. It doesn't mean he's a monster. I forgave my ex, he also never meant to do any of that. He just didn't know any better. And me, who'd had things done to me without consent, had never learned how to say no. It was a bad combination.

Along my journey to self actualization or healing I was conditioned to focused primarily on Western Medicine solutions as they’ve been aggrandized. 

What I learned is that the entire Health Care System is infested with con artists - covert narcissists who ignore the root cause an it contralto worsens through out your life spans by hide the symptoms. 

I learned from Dr. Sam. Vaknin, Dr. Gabor Mate, Dr. Shefali to name a few that those attracted to the Health Care System including Psychiatry were caged in the role
of care taker or rescue savior due to their dysfunctional family system. Yes they too have a false self or
God Complex like BPD. It’s rigid, omnipotent and they believe their lies. 

Those who studied health care in college invested in memorizing a script and adopting it as truth without knowing the consequences of the actions taken. 

They had grandiose hopes that big pharma was contributing to medicine as a cements. Many never realize they are living in a god complex  full
of confabulations. Once we become enlightened we all realize we’ve been lied to on every level by everybody and begging to find real answers by going within. 

Health Care is laughing all the way to the bank with your money. They create dependency not autonomy in clients. A parasitic system.


You may find curing yourself through studying what works and does not work for you is a way to stay focused on yourself rather than others. Your abandonment wound is ripped open. Where you self destruct and push people away. You’ll have to become friends with the many broken children inside of you before they will be kind to others. First they must learn to be kind to you and allow you to control yourself. 
We are a hostage to your own childhood until we heal
When BPD is alone they abuse themselves. When they are with others they instigate others to abuse them or they abuse others. 

There is no point for BPD to have relationships until they have 5 hobbies they are experts in. 

We are never in a relationship with anyone else. We are only in relationships with the broken pieces of our selves. With our distorted hearing filter that perceives everything as an attack, slight, criticism, or abandonment . 
We are all empty. Literally notice your body when you stay still. It becomes stuck stagnant and a black whole.


How will you close the chakras that are ripped open? 

Get involved in fitness. We can understand Psychology all day but most psychologists are at home abusing their spouses or being abused because they thought there were going to find the answer to ending the narcissistic abuse cycles they suffered in childhood.

The therapist just sort of looked at me with a smirk and said “is that a serious reason or are you winging it” and she went on a tangent about how she’s saying how she really feels and everyone is saying she feels different. I left the session early because it broke my heart, to see her like that. I don’t want her romantically at all but she’s an amazing person and it kills me to see her so different. I spoke to her yesterday and she told me that she wants to go to a friends party on Sunday, I asked if she felt up to that, she said yea. But Tuesday in our session she will say I asked her to come, I made her go, I can already see it coming, so I told her I wanted to go alone and that I thought she should spend the day with her kids to which she said ok",Fire-bird67,True,1694622121.0
16hql3t,"The forced thing is tough because she could have easily wanted to have sex with you but also didn't want to for a variety of reasons and she is now allowing herself to say it was forced to excuse her own actions. I would literally ask her, ""So, you feel like I took advantage of you?"" because that's essentially what she is alluding to when she says forced. I would want her to say to my face that she genuinely felt forced and to explain her perception of the incident. Also, if she really felt like you forced her to have sex I can assure you she more than likely wouldn't be trying to maintain a friendship. I would also tell her how the way she described the sex as ""forced"" has affected YOU, not everything should be about her.

Also, can I ask...Do you actually care if she's attracted to you? Especially if you don't want to be with her physically or emotionally. I understand that as a friend it would be hard to hear that they aren't attracted to you but if you're not romantically interested in her why care about her opinion? I'm sure 10 million other people find you attractive who could be better looking and nicer than her so why put so much investment into what SHE thinks of you? Personally, I think you should distance yourself a bit until she can view your and her relationship the way that you want her to. This isn't a one-way street where she only gets what she wants and I can tell you the perception that I get from the way you describe things is that she's not super great for your self-confidence. I wouldn't end the relationship but I would for sure take a big step back to make her realize she needs to treat you better as a friend. Again BPD or not the world doesn't solely revolve around her.",FerkinSmert,False,1694623486.0
16hql3t,"The attractive thing was more of a “huh?” Type thing because it’s literally one of the things she’s said most often was how attractive she found me. I just was so opposed to what she literally says all the time that I was more confused in that moment. I’ve made it clear to her that nothing romantic is going to come from this. It difficult to explain how quickly all of this has happened I’m just stunned by the speed everything was good with her and it was like over night bam a complete 180. She doesn’t hurt my self confidence it’s just not the best feeling to hear someone seem so cold and completely different. I have stopped texting her as often, and I’ve set up a rule that we cannot see eachother so often and that I’m going to be doing my own thing for a while that I’m happy to support her if needed but I’m not going to be revolving my life around it. I also feel really bad for the guy she’s talking to because he does genuinely seem like a good dude, and he shouldn’t have to go through it. She admits he knows nothing that she’s lied to him about most things. What really got me what when she said I like being with him because my kids are not around and I like life without them. That’s when I got her ex husband involved. Because she’s pawning the kids off to do things. I do have a question though. Does she actually know what she’s doing, because when she does have moments of clarity she says that she just doesn’t see how she’s doing anything wrong it all just seems normal to her? And she does get quite emotional and you see glimpses of her and she says she’s sorry to us and she knows something is wrong but she just can’t see it no matter who points it out she can’t take herself out to see it , it just feels like she’s doing thing how everyone else would.",Fire-bird67,True,1694624272.0
16hql3t,"You're going to hate this reply but more than likely no, she doesn't know what she is doing is wrong until after she's reacted but she still needs to be held accountable for her actions. I have been in a relationship for 10 years and to this day there are instances where I perceive my actions or words as ""normal"" when in fact they are the complete opposite. It's also difficult because he also faced a decent amount of abuse and neglect as a child. One example I can give that's always stuck with me was when I was watching a TikTok of a woman who recorded her abuser verbally harassing her and I was genuinely confused at what everyone was so upset about in the recording thinking, ""Ahh he wasn't that bad"" (He was 100% saying awful, vile things). Yeah...I literally didn't realize a video of a man berating his girlfriend about how worthless, ugly, etc was an abusive situation...YIKES...and it wasn't until I went to the comments and realized ""Oh, people actually aren't supposed to talk to each other like this,"" but I honestly didn't know...I know that sounds stupid but it's a sad reality for many with BPD especially those with negative internal dialogues and past trauma. Truthfully, I can really only see things with clarity once I've already acted on it which means I have to be surrounded by strong, compassionate, forgiving people who know that I am seriously trying my best. So to get back to your original question...more than likely no she doesn't know she's being horrible but you need to hold her accountable for her actions and get her to care about more than just her own feelings. Also, I hate to say it but it's probably better for the kids to be with the dad and not see her if she truly thinks her life is better without her children. Sorry if that's harsh as someone trying to conceive I'm sick of hearing about shit mothers.

16gx8jo,"Okay well first of all, I am also demisexual so I relate to sex repulsion. And naturally I have BPD, too.

Second of all - this does not sound like DBT kind of issue. It sounds like you have gotten legitimately traumatized over this event, as you said. I would advise you to seek out a trauma therapist.

Give it time. Give yourself time to heal and get over this hurt. Is it actually the couples that bother you - or is it the fact that they remind you of a person who hurt you, and the shame it caused you to feel? 

I know it might sound like a huge no no, but I'd also advise you to perhaps see a sexual therapist. While sex repulsion is a valid and okay thing to feel, it should *not* disrupt your life to the point where you avoid people just because you know they've had sex in their life. Or they're married.

Sex therapists are highly educated and will understand your demisexuality, and will not push into anything that's uncomfortable. They deal with people in your situation, and they can genuinely help you find the balance between who you are and how this situation has affected you.

Lastly, I genuinely feel bad for you. Take some time for yourself. This person hurt you - but it wasn't your fault. You are still a great person and worthy of being cared for. _You have not done anything wrong and you have nothing to be ashamed of._ You are not pathetic, you are hurt. And that's perfectly okay.

When you are ready, seek out to talk about your feelings. To me it sounds like all these feelings of shame manifest as a fear of attachment. Talk about them. Don't be afraid to tell people about them. They are okay feelings to have, natural. Everyone in your stead would feel exactly like you, betrayed and hurt. 

Oh and one more thing, out of love... Please use paragraphs!

I wish well for you :)",Melthiela,False,1694553903.0

I agree this isn’t a DBT issue and I’ll be graduating soon. My BPD was really out of control and DBT has helped a lot. I’ll definitely explore my options with trauma and sexual therapists and EMDR. 

Ive had chronic DPDR for almost three years (started before my relationship) that stems from shame and it’s worsened from this traumatic event.

Cry if you need to. We DO have more intense emotions than normal people, which is why we create all these coping strategies to avoid them - they hurt more than normal people.

Feeling them takes the power out of them - because you will be fine. You’ll get through the weekend and see your partner.

In my case: two things helped. 
1.) planning with him our next visit immediately. If I have nothing to look forward to it’s very upsetting for me.
2.) realizing o get my time back. I love my boyfriend - but having him there means no time to clean, no time to catch up on work, less time to do laundry and stuff.

16gvj40,"I have a method to my madness that may create resolution. 

When I have an intrusive obsessive thought I give  permission to the part to obsess over it while I begin to take in a deep breath and begin to blow out excesses energy and trapped emotions.

Sometimes I will even freestyle a song about it. It’s a great way to parent our inner children and being able to move on with the day without feeling stuck. 
In the body we feel safe cool calm collect. 
In the mind it’s a kaleidoscope or merry go round. Start to learn the difference of the true-self and false self. Just witness from behind the scenes. That’s all we really can do until we learn to master the master piece we created. 

We are like an helium ballon. We float away from our bodies and live in the higher realms. Some may be fantasy and /or other dissociate realms. 

We are sensitive to external and internal triggers. We learned fight or flight and have been trained at professionally walking on egg shells which is a form of acting like everything is okay when it’s not. 

Now we need to restrengthen the neuromuscular pathways with a functional movement activity to reactivate any faulty or dismissive frequency’s. 

We need to learn to regulate our neuromuscular system with breath. 

It’s key to care for your abdomen to be able to make decisions from a place of stability rather that fight or flight. 

When we are in chaos we know we’ve been making choices in the past from the  fight or flight mode which is patterns of self destructive or self sabotage. 


When BPD isn’t in their creative element like dance, DJ-ing, art work, exercise, music we tend to fell unworthy and invert ourselves into other people instead of our own lives and become dependent on micro managing them. We need to develop the fine motor skills to express ourselves however wild and crazy that looks it’s uniquely you and you BPD are a shiny star and yet you don’t even know who you are! So shiny ✨ tap in and you will win. 

Change comes as we choose to show up, learn the lessons and create new patterns for ourselves. Sometime with BPD we’ve self destructed so much we believe we will never find our way out but we can little by little. 


For all my BPD Posture restoration institute will help and if you have GERD with BPD this is common. The medical system will not treat the GERD. You need to google hiatal hernia syndrome and learn how to heal the root cause. This will help end your binge eating that leads to obesity and then diabetes. It’s a self sabotaging way of slow suicide. Save yourself from your other self. 

Best thing I ever did was learn to have fun with myself. All of my selves. I play acoustic guitar, piano, djembe, roller skate, I enjoy writing songs, and creating children’s books. Music is healing for BPD it will reconnect the lungs and regulate the emotions and emptiness. 

If anyone is struggling with being able to learn watch 

Jim Kwik to learn how to learn.

But I think I agree, when I let go of the imposter syndrome, that there is trauma involved in the diagnosis. My trauma looked different from a lot of people here, but ultimately it did involve some emotional invalidation (mom treating me like an adult confidant instead of the developing child that I was, and getting upset when I did in fact make child-like mistakes). I developed abandonment issues with so many people dying around me, and how that scared me that everyone in my life will either die or leave me. Children in my classes ostracizing me for growing up atheist in the Bible Belt of the US, so I learned to hide that part of myself and even feel shame and fear for not believing in God. 

I have blamed my mom I realize, even if she often said I was “perfect” (her words) and loves me very much in her own intense way. And when I have brought up her effect on my life, it’s been shut down as the “blame game” instead of my intent to explore how I became this way.

16dnbjp,"No, that's [one of the diagnostic criteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3494330/) and yes, [BPD has developmental factors independent of trauma.](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/borderline-personality-disorder/causes/). As a matter of fact, it's my personal pet theory that while trauma can be a cause, lack of it can be, too (under exposure to stressful stimuli at different developmental stages leads to not developing healthy coping strategies for these events that are inevitably stronger and regularly occurring in adult life, such as simple criticism; essentially never being pressed to grow up and then struggling as an adult because of it). A lot of the people I've worked with who have had BPD are, essentially, adult spoiled children who never learned to respect boundaries of others and cannot understand why their behaviors push others away. This is, by and large in my personal experience, associated with those BPD patients who scored higher on comorbid narcissistic traits, but is also an example of only one of multiple directions this could take. There are a bunch of innocent parents and ex partners out there paying for the manipulation and gaslighting of their adult child or ex partner, just as there are many people with BPD who genuinely did suffer at the hands of those people in their lives. 

IMHO BPD as a behavioral descriptor is too broad and ultimately will be separated into separate categories (like the fairly informal ""quiet BPD,"" or the ""malicious\manipulative"" BPD, etc) based on pathology and subsequent best treatments in future versions of the DSM. Until then, to more directly answer you, childhood trauma is only one of 4 commonly recognized contributing factors and not a prerequisite. You can look on this very sub to find some of the ""I just realized I'm the asshole,"" posts and figure out that while there are plenty with genuine trauma, there are others whose personal perception doesn't match up real well with objective reality and untangling can be pretty messy. Things they'd rationally condone in the parenting of others, for example, are cast in apocalyptic light in their own memories because they're being examined and framed emotionally rather than logically, which is a fantastic demonstration of the functional dissociation between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex.",Major_Boot2778,False,1694231264.0

16dnbjp,"May I ask, are you diagnosed BPD yourself or are you a professional who works with people with BPD? Im assuming working in the field by your comment on “BPD patients”. However, I couldn’t possibly disagree with you more about someone with no trauma developing BPD. I think the link of childhood trauma as well as being chronically invalidated, and dismissed has little to no correlation to a parent who under exposes a child to stimuli and my reasoning would be because there wouldn’t be a negative attachment style and no trauma. To be honest I only put the “many say you don’t need a trauma” thing to not piss off the self diagnosed because that seems to be the caveat for many self diagnosed, which don’t get me stated on….I myself was diagnosed in in-patient in 2018 just for clarification.

It’s also pretty disheartening to read that a majority of the BPD people that you’ve worked with are “essentially, adult spoiled children who never learned to respect others” (I do agree with the ending portion, we do push people away) but I genuinely couldn’t disagree more AGAIN. I think it’s a case by case basis like the quiet vs loud BPD but I surely wouldn’t classify someone with loud BPD as the ‘malicious and manipulative’ version. More often then not people with BPD aren’t trying to screw people over manipulate anyone, we’re trying to figure out how to increase the value of our lives and those around us.

I posed my question more as an exercise to say, “most of us do blame our BPD from trauma caused by someone, but now that most of us are adults and are out of that situation do we still feel this way?” I really hope you don’t take my reply as coming after you as I understand your opinion and I’ve heard it many times but I would request that if you are going to share those opinions here in a BPD recovery space, please consider that most of us have been verbally abused so to come onto a forum and read some of the ways you’ve described people with BPD is very difficult and truthfully causes harm. I understand words like “manipulator” “spoiled” “malicious” don’t seem like harsh words…and again, in some cases is a fair assessment, but I think this isn’t an appropriate venue. Sure there are many negative traits to BPD but it sure seems like BPD is the only mental illness where all we focus on is the negative.

I’m diagnosed with “quiet” BPD and I feel chronically guilty because, while there were many deaths in the family growing up and my mother had poor emotional regulation skills, I grew up in a loving home.

My mother and I argued almost every day and I think I did learn some unhealthy core memories, but I was not abused or neglected. 

I am struggling to be an adult because I don’t feel like one. I haven’t adjusted to being independent, and I don’t have a lot of internal direction or drive. My parents would be happy if I lived with them for the rest of my life, jobless and entirely dependent on them as long as I was around. We have a lot of love for each other but I think overall this mindset has been detrimental to my wellbeing, and led to my diagnosis. 

Tl;dr I was coddled and enabled growing up and I have quiet BPD now.

There's a pretty logical trail of cause and effect for everything in the human psyche and as we further unveil its myriad components, we develop more and more fitting and effective treatments for various conditions.

As such, I'm sorry for your position but there's plenty of good reason to be hopeful :) one of the biggest plusses that I see, personally, is that sorry BPD tends to be more introspective and insightful, which I believe leads to a better prognosis.

Anyone else here have the realization that they're kind of a garbage human unmedicated?  
I was diagnosed back in 2018 after getting fed up with my own temper, because I knew it was way out of line and abnormal. I hyperfocused on BPD, read some books, got a few workbooks, started on medication and found my sweet spot.  
  
All of that has led to a lot of self awareness and recovery, and lately I made a casual comment to a friend that when I'm not medicated I'm overall just a garbage human and she got a little upset with me. It's not even meant to be self depreciating or derogatory, it's just the truth. 😂 Anyone else feel that way?",RotterWeiner,False,1694204780.0

I wouldn't say that I'm a garbage human being unmedicated, but I was a human being that made mistakes and handled things poorly.  And I think that's a distinction that's important to make.

16d7qr0,"Hi I’m a certified relationship coach accepting clients and a professional cluster b recovery coach who also suffered BPD. 

The best thing anyone with cluster B can do in my humble opinion are the following.

1st. Watch Conscious Intimacy by Dr Shefali on YouTube without distractions and dissociation. BPD and NPD are incapable of learning until they learn how to learn. 
* Side Note (Jim Kwik teaches Broken brains or all cluster B how to learn on Mind Valley. )

Conscious Intimacy on YouTube will be the first 10 years of therapy. You will be 10 years advanced and save $100,000 if you are capable of listening and comprehending. It may takes you 100 listens and that is perfectly normally for BPD and fine. It’s free. knowledgeable is powerful and will help to ground your distorted reality into the Real Reality. 
BPD lives in a fantasy defense and has no understanding of what’s real or not until 15 years of healing. 

2nd. Listen in audible to the book Healing the toxic shame that binds you to further accept that you were toxically shamed for every inch of your being. You’ve become an empty void of circus mayhem with many harsh abusive inner critics who abuse you and those around you. You are a parade of frienemys. 
What you do to others is what you do to yourself. So watch your outside to see how you treat yourself inside and take responsibility for all the made up parts that helped you survive your evil abusive mother who you perceive as loving and good while your perceived yourself as all bad/demonic. 
Start to understand how you were shamed and reverse the process by being who it was you always were but were denied to exist. 

3. Google Posture Restoration Institute and find a provider near you. You may have to drive an hour but it is the only way to heal. You need to create s constellation self. You don’t live in your body. You live inside other peoples minds which is why you are so easily triggered and want everyone to be there all the time. Because their life force energy and mind are where you feel safe and grounded. Where when your alone all the haunted house is pushing you to hate on or kill yourself. 

4. Learn to sing or dance. You need to connect with your true emotions and stop acting. Everything you do is acting. Your such a great actor you can’t stop doing it and you are even deceiving yourself. 

5. Get a lush toy. Your life force energy is like a clogged toilet. If tour not staying very busy and distracted yourself at all time from who you are then your energy is stuck stagnant  and negative.
A lush will keep you in the moment and move your life force energy. The energy of life is sexual energy.

No contact or Low contact are the only options, and continue on with your life.

The best 'revenge' is to be happy and successful. These people are not here for you so don't try to create a relationship that was never there. It is sad, but it is the reality, they cannot change or admit they were wrong so they won't become supportive. 

From what you said, they are still trying to scapegoat you by picking fights, they haven't changed and won't.

I began seeing her with run of the mill depression- which has been a factor in my life since middle school, but as time went on, life events became heavier, BPD symptoms magnified intensely.  I internalize mostly, so have done a decent job hiding it or distracting people with something else and generally polishing up my practice of ineffective coping mechanisms. The carefully constructed house of cards fell eventually, and hard.  

I, too felt like some things just totally didn’t fit. I have been in a committed marriage for 15 years- how could this be?  I googled “What does BPD look like day to day” and read around.

My advice is two-fold:

1. Be curious and just try a bunch of things. There is so much out there to try and experience, most of it you’ve probably never even heard of. You don’t have to know what you like right away. Just explore and see what sticks with you. 

2. In terms of education/career, start with something general. You can always specialise later. Don’t rush into a niche you will have a hard time breaking out of. Starting with something fairly general (e.g. business, psych, CS… depending on what you find intriguing) will give you room to pivot into different careers. That’s what I happened to do (not because I had this plan, it just worked out that way) and I’m very grateful for the flexibility it has allowed me. 

Don’t put too much pressure on yourself to have it all figured out right now. It’s ok. I still find new things I like to do that I never would have thought of before. Enjoy the exploration! 🧭",Budget-Astronaut-660,False,1692737567.0

15ygo4l,"I had a really hard time figuring out “what I wanted to do.” I guess the best place to start is to ask yourself some general questions. Are you ok going to college? Do you want a 2 year diploma or a 4 year degree? It may take a bit of research as well into what you like but also research if what you like is employable. For me, I enjoyed working with people and I liked humanities in college. But I wanted something that was employable. Where I am (Canada) education and social work are the most employable humanities (generally). I didn’t want to work in a school only forever so I took social work because it was tons of options and I absolutely love it! So I guess try narrowing down some interests and realistically what you’re able to handle/afford. If a 4 year degree seems to daunting, maybe try a certification in something! Anything is possible. I didn’t think I could get a degree with bpd but it’s definitely do able with supports. My sister has bipolar and works in a beauty salon and loves it as well. Anything is possible!

15ygo4l,"I don't know how old you are but it doesn't sound like you're very old, possibly at the stage where you're leaving college and considering uni?

When I left Sixth Form (age 16-18, UK) my head of year absolutely hated me because I was the only one who didn't go to university. She said I was letting myself (and the school) down, but my argument was that I didn't know what I liked to learn, let alone what I wanted to do at degree, so why saddle myself with thousands in student debt for nothing?
Anyway, I left and a few months later I was working in the new cinema complex. 
Fast forward a few years, left the cinema and got a job as a sampler with the Environment Agency which I liked, but I was too anxious and shy to be confident enough to make it my own. My physical health required a job swap into an office role after a year or so, too.

Then, I got ill. My BPD, or depression, or a mix of everything I have, made it impossible for me to work. I lost my job, my driving licence (surrendered because of suicidal ideation), friends, family, money..
That was ten years ago and it was a dark time. I was 26.

As I slowly, very slowly, started recovering, I had the inkling in the back of my mind that I wanted to work in mental health. I didn't know how or what role, just that I did. So I started to take some distance learning courses in various mental health related subjects. I volunteered as a peer support group facilitator. I did mental health first aid. Two years ago I volunteered with a charity that teaches adults to read, as a Coordinator, and my confidence rocketed.

In April this year, at the age of 36, I started working for the NHS at a secure mental health inpatient hospital. I work in a social centre that's part of the occupational therapy department, and from my very first day there I absolutely loved it - and that is no exaggeration.
I work 16hr a week and that's enough for now, because I do struggle with severe fatigue from my physical illnesses. But the job is perfect.
And in September I'm going to college to do a year-long Access to Higher Education diploma so that next year I'll be ready to go to University to study to become a fully qualified Occupational Therapist! 

So please, please, please do NOT worry about your age or your twenties 'disappearing' while you decide what you want to do! Life is so, so short and we aren't guaranteed another go - make the best out of this one.
Take the jobs that you'll enjoy, try volunteering, do some night classes, travel, socialise, try out loads of new hobbies...

Things have a way of falling into place when you're not forcing them to - if you're not 100% sure what you want to do, don't go to uni. Why study something if it won't further your career or education path?
Use the time and money on other things instead.

15xcs28,"It's very hard to do. And unfortunately there aren't really any shortcuts. I have found peace in being single and understanding and working on my friendships and familial relationships. I do get lucky, and sometimes I find myself mindlessly swiping on tinder and taimi. I guess I'm lucky  because I'm an average guy and my profile is pretty clear about what sorts of relationships/friendships and the types of people I'm looking for. So I think my 'autism' or particularism selects out a lotta folk that could be dangerous for my mental health. So I admit, I do have a leg up there. I couldn't imagine being attractive and being seen only as a piece of meat by others online and getting mindless right swipes. I think I'd have trouble managing my emotions with so much positive and validating attention.

But as to what I did personally:-lots of therapy and self help and self evaluation

\-started working on developing hobbies for myself. Do those hobbies when I feel self harmy.

\-started going to the gym more than I already had been. (and trying my hardest to NOT compare to other people. Just focus on my own progress and how far i've come).

\- drinking a lot more water. taking a multivitamin.

\-When I'm feeling self destructive, putting my phone down and breathing. Going outside for air, sitting, playing with my dog.

\-eating :( I'm working on my binging. but it's definitely been a help, unfortunately. A crutch.

\-I've slowly cut out marijuana over the past many months. Slowly cut down on drinking as well.

\-trying to eat better. Go to the grocery store every sunday. Try to combat impulse spending.

I'm not perfect. I still have extreme lapses. Occasionally i engage with social media in very unhealthy wise commenting things on facebook that garners unwanted attention, and then i have hard time putting those threads down and moving on. OCD and bpd is fun lol. Validation and obssessivness yay.

The biggest thing is self awareness: knowing when you're about to do bad things for yourself. And trying to not go all in on the bad thing. A good example is, maybe I did comment something that garnered a lot of unwanted attention on social media. Next step is attempting to understand why the negative attention is coming my way, working to accept ""yeah I said something really dumb. I can do better"" or ""yeah I said something mostly true but the types of people commenting don't think the same way so they're going to come at me as if I'm wrong entirely with little to no thought in their response, just whatever emotion they're feeling"".

15ueukp,"Hi I’m so sorry you are going through this. I am going through something similar my my ex where he saw that side of me and stuck by for afew months after I apologised profoundly and promised to do therapy that helped me alot especially DBT and journaling like writting down all my horrible thoughts when splitting from him and the pain confusion and all on paper then burn it. He also has quiet BPD and we love each other alot but its too painful to be in a romantic relationship where we just trigger each other and bring out the worst. Romantic relationship I believe for me is a safe haven a refuge from life and support one another but it must be both sides to work. Unfortunately my partner saw me as overwhelming and such a burden when I just wanted love and to be close by him body mind and spirit he felt too overwhelmed and split from me. Which tbh was very cruel and hurtful from him especially when I had been making huge improvements in terms of emotional regulation and no panic attacks for months. Instead of celebrating this he threw it all in my face. 
Thinking back it would’ve been better if he let me down gently in the beginning before leading me on into a committed partnership and making me believe his intentions and love is strong to hold both of us. 
Heck we even agreed to do couples therapy if he had a splitting episode. Alas that was just talk and he broke that promise. 
He decided that we need to put our romantic relationship on hold till we do healing work whatever that looks like for him I have no idea. 
I finally realised through doing the work of DBT and CBT that the only thing I can control is my own behaviour, my attitude and reactions. Even my thoughts I started to be able to observe them and release them saying to them that is not helpful (insert your name) that thought is ruining the day for you choose another thought a more pleasant one. This realisation came shocking to me like a light bulb suddenly lit up I don’t know if it was the CBT+DBT+ voice recordings where I would imagine the person who angered me sitting infront of me and I’m offloading venting ranting a method from Psychotherapy or journaling. But all I can say is that it works as 
I switched from controlling behaviour towards my favourite person to a more accepting and control my own self instead. 

My therapist advised me not to disclose mental health personal sensitive info early on till I can see clear signs of trust, which she says takes around 200hours of interaction with someone to really know them well enough.

I am in a similar situation only difference with my ex (he broke up with me during his low splitting faze and I couldn’t take it so we decided to stay in touch and support each other emotionally) also he has done it before and it stems from his core abandonment core) he told me he feels like he isn’t good enough for me and that I will leave him. He is terrified of rejection ironically he is the one who brokeup and left. 
The previous time he broke up again during splitting he came back saying he loves me and can’t live without me he apologised for his behaviour and asked me to forgive him, which I did after he promised that if this was to happen again we won’t break up but will see a therapist together. 
Fast forward to last week he broke up and didn’t even consider therapy he refused to hear me and seemed convinced that break up is final. 
I however do not believe its final mainly because he said he loves me and cares alot about me. His behaviour also shows it as he’d text and call me multiple times a day to check I was doing fine (I had a nervous breakdown when he dropped the bomb on me luckily it was face to face and he held me tight saying how much he loves me and to please trust him) 
I have been very confused since as I don’t understand how a person can go from being madly inlove to not wanting to see or be with their loved one and treating them coldly and breaking up with them in 24h! 
I am really struggling this time as he hasn’t texted me asking about me like he did last week and I don’t know what to do. I feel stuck and really sad too. 
I am thinking of going no contact? 
Thing is I get really anxious worried and scared if he doesn’t reply after afew hours (max 3h) and you can’t imagine what kind of agony I go through if I don’t hear back in 24h literally I stop functioning.

I never went a day without thinking about them in 10months and they even got into another relationship but I was okay. I didn’t have panic attacks after the first month or two.

Imo, the stigma is most perpetuated by the DSM’s failure to serve humans rather than insurance companies. 

There are stages to the recovery on both sides of this relational coin, and I have found that the separation of codependents is important for that recovery to begin for both. If someone needs a space where they are comforted by the thought that “the person who hurt me can’t be here” it provides the opportunity for free expression of pain without the fear of judgment and the addition of support. This is something we all need, and codependents early in recovery struggle to assert for themselves if challenged emotionally. But no one’s recovery looks the same. If it is not the place for someone to recover, they can find another place or use it as it’s helpful. I’m sure you’re aware that not every place is good for every person, and I see that place as a first step for many who are ill or as maladaptive as anyone else with a PD.

He got super mad and gave me the silent treatment for days because he wanted to meet up one evening and I couldn’t I explained that would be great but sorry I can’t as I had such a long shitty day at work and I just can’t meetup. Another time he got angry when I hadn’t replied to him message I was sleeping then next morning he bursted down at my place looking frantic demanded why I didn’t answer the night before, he clearly saw me sleeping in bed and my phone off he got angry and left. Later I texted him sorry I didn’t reply I was asleep and thank you for coming to check on me. Eventhough we made up after that incident he became distant, disconnected whenever we’d spend time together he’d be either on his phone scrolling or watching Netflix. He’d also frequently withhold intimacy and last time when I started making out with him he turned away saying his back hurts is super tired he said sorry he can’t. I just had to suck it up and not make a big deal but I felt something was off as our relationship was built on love and alot of displays of affection and strong intimacy.
from there it spiralled quick down hill. Every attempt to address issues and talk about my feelings were met with defensiveness, blame and silent treatment. 
He had broken up with me many times but quickly would come back apologise for his behaviour and say it stems from fear and self sabotage he would tell me how much he loves me and want to grow old with me, when he was in the love/ idealising faze he asked me to please never let go even if he threatened to break up and that I would just need to remind him of the pact we made to be together no matter what. 
Now I think he is in the splitting faze and I can’t get through to him.
I suspect (he has quiet BPD with core wound fear of abandonment) so after the last episode we had agreed that do couples therapy but the very next day when I wrapped my arms around him and kissed him tenderly he looked at me with ice cold eyes sat me and to my shock broke up with me. I tried to bring him back from this dark place he was in to remind him of our beautiful love story of our pact of doing therapy. But he wouldn’t snap out of it. I had an emotional break down and he hugged me so tight for hours I cried in his arms.

We all have friends with whom we have different levels of closeness, and with whom we discuss different aspects of our lives. It’s not dishonest to keep your health private; I bet you know plenty of people who are dealing with health issues privately. It’s up to you to decide if your friends are worthy of opening up to.

Here are some things to consider: Are you very close with these friends? Do they tend to be prejudiced people or are they usually more likely to adopt a nuanced view? Do they often talk behind people’s backs? Do they get defensive when called out?

15njz4x,"I find that being in a relationship with someone who is not securely attached (emotionally healthy), triggers all of my anxiety to an extreme.

I was married to someone for 13 years who I always felt secure and stable with. He was honest and loyal and communicative and would do anything for me. My therapist said I didn't have BPD. I had already done a lot of work previously and throughout the marriage and so there were no symptoms really flaring up. Maybe every great once in a while I would split and it would be a fight but it was so rare. 

Then my next relationship was with someone who is an anxious avoidant. He would pull me in and then push me away. I was constantly anxious to the point of having panic attacks which I had not had in over a decade. Emotionally the relationship was destroying me and putting me at my BPD worst.

So if your person is secure and trustworthy and loyal and communicative, perhaps there is some work that you need to do. If they are not stable in their cadence of reaching out to you and things are hot and cold or you don't feel like you have comfort and where you stand. this may not be the best person for you.

I do have my people but ""fixing me"" was and is my responsibility, not others. Keeping my bpd in check is my thing to do. But not just for their sake either, but for myself. It helped that I wanted to not hurt them, sure, but once I started I learnt that if I went on the recovery road I had to be sure that I wanted to change myself, and love *me* better, or it wasn't going to go anywhere.  


I only found a good balance when I understood that neither my FP (now not my ""FP"" but still my partner in crime) or friends, or family, were responsible for my feelings or actions/reactions. They weren't responsible for my happiness or my unhappiness. They added to it wether good, or bad, because that's life, but they weren't and shouldn't be the center of my universe. I learnt to enjoy my time alone, to love things for myself.   


It took a while. Recovering from this is neither easy, nor fast. Rushing too much can lead to get worse (It happened to me when I started). I slowly started to forgive myself, processing pain, I found my own place in my life. And now, I love my people but they are not a need. They are just a great part of my life.

the great fucking thing is you haven’t lost anything from leaving. you’ve actually gained a much much higher chance of not self harming or killing yourself by not being with the person. you’re completely better off and you’re going to find that out in a couple days and even know it while  splitting her white. 

journal as much as possible. this person won’t be able to get out of you’re mind. so just journal journal journal. use the internet and psychiatrist to research abusive relationship patterns and techniques of manipulation. never let this happen to yourself again, you deserve better. nobody deserves this to happen to them

spot all the ways you’ve been manipulated by this person. learn how your bpd was used against you. the splitting, the trust, the emotional dependency.

constantly putting yourself in vulnerable situations to find out if the other person even cares about hurting you anymore.


then do some research on npd. really get inside their head. know how these people operate. their motivations and desires. their language patterns. their behavior around others. their thoughts about themselves and the world. how they treat other people.

put yourself in this persons shoes now. see the world through the eyes of a cat killer. how would you treat them.

gift giving, love bombing, getting irrationally upset and shutting down, lying to them, gaslighting the shit out of them, deceiving them. complete denial. charming and admiring the shit out of them. make them feel like your their victim. pretend that you’re more morally sensible than they are and just tell them you know better sometimes. ignore the shit out of them if you don’t think they’re capable of violence. guilt trip them, shame them, intimidate them. divert divert evade evade always keep them one step behind you. and when you don’t have any words for them, just use your eyes and stare into them. 

no doubt in my mind. this person has in the past hurt or killed animals or in the future will. they love the feeling of manipulating others and using them. the only thing that will help them is themselves seeking professional treatment for aspd and npd. 

they will continue to use people to numb their pain and throw them out like trash when they get bored. they will manipulate the complete shit out of people, and if the person fights back, they’ll start to make physical threats. 

you saw how in the relationship, this person used your insecurities against you. went from complimenting and covering them for you. to degrading you and tearing them open.

you saw how they one upped you in every situation and belittled you. because the closer you guys got, the more insecure they were, and the more shit they stared to guilt, unnerve, and defang you.

this person knew what they were doing the entire time. they are a complete piece of shit. and you’re going to need some serious therapy to overcome what your feeling right now. they abused you and didn’t give a fuck that they were doing that.

they’re a psychopath in every single sense. and you need to stay away from anyone else like that. never be in this spot again.

you can use therapy to never be as vulnerable, but you need to look through the eyes of a cat killer for a second. and see how they operate if you want to ever avoid them again. that’s how you get away from the pain",uahsuxbaj,False,1691909826.0

15j71mp,"I said the same thing not that long ago to my narcissist ex. Literally I could grab 10 men off of the street and there's a good chance that they will all treat me better than he did. I'm sure my ex was holding back frequently. I'm sure he could have been way worse. That doesn't mean what he did didn't hurt.

The statement really is saying ""You have hurt me so badly and I can't even fathom how one person could do this. I think I could find anyone else and not experience the level of pain that I have with you.""

They are expressing their hurt. Part of our recovery journey is accepting other people's experiences of us. I did this awesome program in Austin called Discovery. During the weekend there was a activity where people would write how they experienced you in a negative way. Then you had to stand there and just take it. No defensiveness. No reacting. 

It was really difficult to hear. But what the activity taught me was to accept other people's experience of me and thank them for their honesty without getting defensive. So now when someone tells me their experiencing me in a negative way, I can listen and thank them for being vulnerable. I can ponder the feedback. Maybe I wholeheartedly disagree and maybe there's some truth to it. If I'm being my best self on my recovery journey I will give it consideration and when there is truth to it acknowledge it and then do a little work with my therapist around it and make amends to the person I hurt. 

This has really made a positive impact on my relationships in my personal life and at work. 

So I guess what I'm saying is take this as feedback. Feedback is a gift that a lot of people will not give us. When someone is honest and vulnerable about how they're feeling it is a gift to us because it can help us grow. People who just stay quiet, shut you out or walk away and don't give the feedback rob us of the opportunity to grow.",Reasonable_Serve8001,False,1691414981.0

15i6s4y,"I have boundaries for my SO. I have expectations that my SO should not cross those boundaries, and if they do, I *will* and *must* hold them accountable. But everything on the other side of those boundaries? ehhhhh....?

I always saw the potential in my pwBPD. I allowed myself to think, they should become what I saw them becoming. And when they didn't fill that mold, in the way I thought they should fill it, I got upset, which inevitably made them split on me or themselves. And...  at a certain point, I had to ask myself, if I keep behaving in a way that makes them worse, do I have the right to be upset at their behavior?

And yeah, obviously, I have the right to be upset at them for doing immature, extreme, even abusive things. I won't excuse that behavior- ever. But, with BPD, they are taking a normal emotion, becoming triggered and hurt by that emotion (much of the time without meaning to), and warping and magnifying it (this part they usually do mean to). And from there, they feel justified in doing something potentially horrible, right? Again, not excusing the behavior, especially when its abusive, just looking at it objectively.

 When I learned that the only part of our relationship I could actually control was my expectations of that person. It simplified things. I had to give up the notion that I had any control over the way they would react to things. I had to understand that walking on eggshells was my attempt to manage them, so I may as well crush all the eggshells, tell them it was their problem if they didn't like crushed eggshells, and move on. If they wanted to stay, they could stay. If they wanted to leave, they would leave.

No matter what you think they should be to you, and for you, they won't. This *includes* their behavior during any mirroring or love-bombing phase.At this point, I have expectations that my pwBPD won't do things to knowingly harm me or our relationship. If they do, I hold them accountable. Everything else? Well, I hope they do what is best for themsleves, because I can only control what is on my side of the fence.",little_did_he_kn0w,False,1691335694.0

15hnegc,"This screams self-harm to be honest. It might make you feel good, but that's precisely what self-harm does when you're deep there. Unless it's a really bad joke...

Is one thing to be accountable for one's deeds, but act like every bpd person is the same and should receive a punishment and ""accept pain"" is another, and it's precisely why that community is so stigmatized around here. Because they are the ones spreading that stigma and making it look like bpd is something that should be punished and not a disorder. Acting like we choose to abuse, choose manipulation in cold blood, and don't deserve to get better without being shamed forever. That we should suffer forever because we hurt them. But reality is no one should 'accept' being insulted, shamed or stigmatized, the same no one deserves the abuse bpd enforces. 

As someone with a pretty long recovery road (that's still going) that was able to take accountability for the things I did, in a healthy way, accepting *that* shame, feeling the pain and making peace with the past, being even able to fix the relationship with the person I abused emotionally, I know that dammed community is the furthest thing from any kind of healthy ""take accountability"" space.

I know what I did, I'm not proud of it, but I don't beat myself everyday from it. As I said, I even fixed the relationship with my ""FP"" -even tho I wouldn't consider them my FP now at this point.- But of course there's people from my past that didn't forgive me, or that I couldn't even apologize to because I never knew I was wrong or had this before they disappeared, and I made peace with that too.

Just to be quite frank with you, it could curb his behavior if it makes him understand it’s not an appropriate way to get his needs met but it may make him feel like you don’t care about him and his behavior may in turn worsen

My two cents is to talk to him about how his behavior is impacting you (if you haven’t already). He needs to want to do better in order to start doing better though. He may not be in a position where he’s able to understand or make the changes necessary to not act out in this way.

In the long run, it's very beneficial. And it is especially beneficial when it comes to relationships. 

The only thing is: 1. It tends to get worse some weeks before it gets better because of having to learn and cope and directly deal with the triggers, so it might be a though time but it is worth it. 2. Consistency is key (and for me this is where I fell short and now a year later I'm starting the course materials again individually because what I learned seems to be easily unlearned as I just stopped applying it because it helped so much so I felt like I didn't need it anymore which i def do. But i think with the right support and people motivating it will be easy to stick w it. )

You're right. You cannot do anything about it. You can talk to him about it and tell him it makes you very uncomfortable and see where it goes from there. Though given the behavior, it's likely ya'll do not fit for a relationship together.

If they just show up on his feed and he sees, he sees. If he clicks to see more that’s where I have an issue.

Porn is an addiction and an epidemic issue. It affects relationships and skews expectations. There has been research done on this. I understand if one does it when they’re single or if both parties consent or even watch it together.

But when you’re in a committed relationship it gets a bit more complicated IMO. Especially if it’s affecting your ability to hav Essex and be intimate with your partner.

Personally as long as it isn’t something as personal as only fans or perhaps going back to the same person as fap material I don’t care as much.

It’s even more acceptable to me if it’s animated cuz that’s different.

But my partner has told me porn has desensitized him and excessive masturbating has given him mild ED.

I don’t think it’s wrong to hold your partner to certain standards. Woman or man I don’t know that anyone would like their partner ogling other people and taking intimacy that should be shared between them and putting it elsewhere or giving it to someone else.

But you can. I did. I had an abusive family and all I was left with was my abusive boyfriend. But I still broke up with him and broke our lease and ate the 8,000$ in fines because he wouldn’t pay them. And I was utterly utterly alone for 2 years.

And you know what? It was better. It was so much fucking better than being with him. 

I thought I was so dependent on him…because we think we need people to survive. We think we can’t do it alone. We are attracted to people who nurture our dependence and who enable us and who convince us we will never be ok without them. And that’s not true. It’s ok. It’s ok to leave.

It’ll be hard and you will be poor and you won’t have support. But you have a job. You will make friends.

Just start doing everything you can to make your escape. Start building up savings on the side. Start focusing on your friendships. Start spending less time with him. Start doing what interests you. He will probably get angrier because you aren’t dependent on him anymore. But it doesn’t matter. Because he is hurtful and you deserve better than that.

Love is respect and this person doesn’t respect you. So you have to respect yourself. No one else will do it for you. You have to care for yourself as if you were the parent you never had.

If your friend was in this situation what would you tell them to do?

Then go do it for yourself.

I fucking hate how BPD makes us think we are stuck with people like this and makes us think we don’t deserve better and makes us believe that we can’t do it alone and we can’t do it because we are worse than everyone else. Don’t believe it. Fight it! You’re better than this. 

You can do it. Fuck BPD. Fuck your family for letting you grow up to believe you can’t do better and that you aren’t worth more and that you have to depend on others.

The world would collapse, If hope didnt exist. I think satisfaction is very attainable if you learn to look at life as an unknowing being. Nobody knows what they’re doing. Honestly, no one knows. I’m 21 myself, and even seeing people doing all of the things I wanted to do, they don’t know what they’re doing. And neither do I. Who am I te judge (this is the hard part ;) ). Look at yourself through a funny lens, see what happens then. Maybe you’ll find something you do often, that is completely ridiculous, and have a good laugh at yourself. It feels great. 

Some  points you made are good, however, very depressing indeed, setting you up to be disappointed. Expecting the worst is not the way you would want to swing on the spectrum, neither to the always positive. Both hurt, preemptively or afterwards. I think being prepared to be hurt is “fine”, knowing what to do if that happens is important. But going into something expecting it, will in some way, influence the outcome. It reinforces your thought pattern of, well, I knew it, i shouldn’t have done this, I’m this and that, etc. Painful. 

Reducing loneliness is hard, I’m not sure I can give advice or feedback on that one. However I wish you the best in that regard too. Loneliness is crippling and very painful. 

I loved the statement “respond, don’t react”. It sounds familiar, but very hard to live by. I’ll keep notice of that one myself. 

I wish you the best in your recovery process and hope you can challenge your thoughts, and also use radical acceptance skills to the fact that there must have been some positive moments, people, whatever in your life at some point. Cherish those, and hopefully realize there is hope for something greater.

Something that has been extremely helpful for me is to continually invest my energy into other activities and people. I do a lot of things alone, and I try step outside of my comfort zone on a regular basis. Currently, I don’t really have a FP because my energy is shared between different activities and friendships.

I have an irrational abandonment fear deep down inside…. As all people with BPD do as is it part of the diagnosis…. So I just have this false belief that this trip will somehow end the relationship. Since there is no real reason to hold on to that the relationship will end my brain just holds onto cheating? I don’t know man - I know it’s irrational. I think a lot of people with BPD have IRRATIONAL jealousy that we know is irrational but it’s still just a constant.

I’m fine when he is here, but once he goes away my mind just starts going into over drive making up stories and interpreting patterns as meaning something other than what they mean and assuming the worst of him and starting to think that he will hurt me. It’s not logical.

No contact is always best at least for a couple years until all wounds have healed. And I wouldn't do it either until moving on romantically entirely and going to therapy for a while to work out these past traumas.

Feelings can linger for a long long time after. Especially depending on how intense the connection was.

He uses social to plaster fake smiles and pretend happy relationships and will make sure and post them anywhere he thinks I might see them like on mutual friends pages even in response to post that are totally inappropriate for him to be plastering pictures of him on date or whatever.

The point is I was totally obsessed until I wasn't. Now he is such a turn off that I blocked everywhere so that I couldn't see anything if I wanted to. 

Also there is something freeing once the blocking has been done. When you can't obsess, it helps your brain get back to a little bit more of a calm state. We've been through this cycle many times and many times of blocking and unblocking each other and I can say that each time the block was done it definitely helped me to start doing better. Unfortunately, every time I would start doing better and getting my life back together it's like he's psychically knew and would show up with a grand hoover.

This time, I have fully accepted that this person is an unhealed narcissist and has no intentions of any self-reflection or work to evolve. It's never going to change. I will always be disrespected. He's more concerned with owning me than caring for me. There is NOTHING there for me. 

And so now the BPD problem of being alone sets in. Not going to lie, there were definitely some days of just sitting on the floor in sobs and feeling like there is nothing in life that I am remotely interested or excited for. But, I forced myself to lean heavily on friends. There were times where I would call up a friend and just say ""I'm not okay."" That was all that was needed and they have rallied around. I've also increased sessions with my therapist because I don't want to lose all of the progress I've made over the last few years and fall back into being a BPD mess.

As someone from outside your relationship, I want to tell you that it's okay if your partner has lost interest in sex; it's not your fault or related to you. The feelings of sadness you're experiencing might be postpartum depression, which is normal after having a baby. It's common to feel like you're not good enough or unattractive or even that your partner doesn't love you during this time. However, please understand that these feelings are coming from within you and don't necessarily reflect the reality of how you actually look or how your partner truly feels about you.

To cope with these feelings, try not to take things too personally and work on grounding yourself. When these negative thoughts arise, try to discipline yourself and remind yourself that constantly overthinking and analyzing won't change anything. If there are things you're afraid of happening, it's best not to dwell on them or let them consume you. Instead, if those fears ever come true, you can deal with them then. Worrying excessively about something that might not even happen will only exhaust you and make you miserable.

I know it's tough, but the only way you can start feeling better is by making an effort while you're going through this difficult time. Don't let your impulses control you; instead, make yourself get up and do something productive around the house, go for a walk or run, or find any activity that keeps you occupied and engaged. This will help you take your mind off negative thoughts and gradually improve your state of mind.",Teesamaha,False,1690014882.0

You may also look into a spiritual community (something with an online presence, something that your friends are sure isn’t a cult). Buddhism is the most natural progression from DBT, but that doesn’t need to be the route you take. I took more of a pagan and philosophy (while not spiritual, they fill that same religious text void for me, but I’m actually encouraged to question them) route.

I know things feel endlessly chaotic (believe me, I KNOW) but long remission is possible. We can never guarantee that we won’t end up back in the throes of it, but the more we’re in remission, the easier it’ll be to return. I wish there was a cure for what we have, I really do. 

There is hope. It takes time. Even just the first step of DBT (safety and skills) can take a year or more.

Recently I’ve had a lot going on, it’s one major bad thing after another. I snapped, I cried and held a pill bottle for an hour. Then I called, at first she asked me very basic questions to asses the situation. But one thing she said felt like someone lifted a weight off me. I told her I just want to stop crying, I don’t know how to stop I can’t handle it and she said “maybe right now you need it, it’s okay to cry and let it out”. She then stayed on the line with me for 38 minutes total until I was breathing better. She was legit concerned about me hanging up and what I would do when I was done the call. 

I hope life is good to her, I needed someone in that moment desperately, if one more person had acted like they didn’t care or dismissed me I wouldn’t be here right now.

14qk0hy,"Hey :) Fist off, that’s awesome, use that motivation!!

I think learning some DBT skills, beginning with mindfulness, is a great start. There’s a lot of great resources for this online and the BPD workbook by Daniel Fox is also very popular. 

I recently started using the self care app Finch and I really like it! You set goals and get points for completing them. The more points you gather, the more your finch grows and learns. It’s super cute!
It also has a great library of suggested goals (e.g., stepping outside once) and integrated exercises (e.g., box breathing). It really helps me keep on top of the things that are important for keeping my emotional vulnerability down, like exercising, leaving the house, socialising, eating regularly, keeping my space clean…

I also recommend you pick a goal you want to work towards. Could be anything, learning a language, an instrument, running a 5k, redecorating your space, finishing the BPD workbook… anything, you get to pick. And then you work on that goal every single day, even if it’s just the tiniest bit. This mindset of [non zero days](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/comments/1qbxvz/the_gospel_of_uryans01_helpful_advice_for_anyone/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) has really helped me make consistent progress without getting bogged down in perfectionism. 

Lastly, give yourself time. Don’t expect all your established patterns to go away over night. Show yourself grace and patience during your recovery. This is a tough road but we’re walking it, one step at a time.

14lxsj2,"I didn't know this until very recently, but I am actually autistic. As a kid, I was very abusive towards my younger brothers, I would scream at them, insult them, hit them, kick them, and throw tantrums constantly. When I was mad at myself, I would either punch myself in the head, or even go as far as to bang my head against the wall repeatedly. Unfortunately the only thing that changed me was the increased levels of abuse I was receiving from my parents, them belittling me and making me feel completely worthless was the only thing that was able to stifle the flames of my intense rage... Now looking back their abuse was likely the reason why I was acting out in the first place. The real question you need to be asking yourself, is where is this rage coming from in the first place? 

I know I'm a nerd for referencing this, but when I watched Avatar The Last Airbender and watched Zuko face these same dilemmas about his own anger issues, it really opened up my eyes to my past. I was able to see the little kid version of myself, before the anger surfaced there was fear.. My anger is created through fear. Now that I am an adult I am trying to unlearn the intense shame that was put onto me, and I am trying to work through understanding where my anger stems from.. It's not an easy process at all. I have been single since junior year of HS, I am now 26, because I am so self aware I know that I don't have the maturity to be with another person like that yet. I do feel like I could end up being emotionally abusive, especially if an SO ended up a FP too. Self control is such a difficult thing to learn in general, but especially with super charged emotions that come with BPD.

Talk to your therapisssttt it’s not good to put this on a professional contact.

Those feelings make them feel guilty or feel like they have to help you in a way that isn’t appropriate. This is emotional manipulation.

I understand both sides since I have it, and have had it done to myself. Me experiencing BPD episodes from the outside was the big catalyst to me seeking help because i realized how uncomfortable it can be on the other side on BPD.

Remember the DBT skill: “Do The Opposite”. When you feel any feeling that tells you you aren’t good enough, that’s a big sign you are in BPD thoughts and you can’t trust them. During those times just do the opposite of what you are pulled to do.

\- a few years ago i realized that having a 'favourite person' is not a healthy contact for me. i will settle for a longer distance with my friends, because i want this relationship to last.

Like yes, you have to do a lot of the work yourself, but that doesn't mean you have no right to get supported or get treatment. You deserve to get help and you also deserve some rest when you're that tired, because not everything has to be a challenge, not everything has to be that exhausting.

I was also diagnosed this march (I'm 22, but in therapy since like 16) and I threw myself fully in that ""I have to work on myself now that I know"" and it just made me even more miserable and burned out. So when I had to go inpatient again because nothing worked out anymore, I couldn't really work on anything. To just keep existing was hard enough, but it was also enough. And it still is. I'm not going to disappear because I'm not working in myself. Instead I got some positive input, I picked up hobbies from my childhood again, indulged in all those ""cringey"" hobbies I talked myself out of to fit in, while also finding new things that excited me. Some of that worked, some didn't, but it was enough to keep busy, keep existing and give my brain some much needed serotonin. Much of those interests don't involve any direct contact to people, so they're relatively safe and low-pressure. And that's what got me on a basis to do therapy properly and work on my issues.

So what I meant to say, I know everything's shit right now. I've been there and I still get there sometimes, and I hate it. But I'm still here and can watch Dinosaur documentaries, play video games, write stupid fanfiction and shitpost about brine shrimp.

That this is a place that is ""real"" and safe, even if I don't feel that at the moment. Of course that's not always possible and I'm still in the process of finding things that can help me ground myself when I'm somewhere else. One of them is an keycharm that was a gift from a friend. It has a good texture I can concentrate on and I associate it with my friend.  


That's mostly for those specific situations though. For that general feeling I don't know if I have anything of merit to say. Mostly just some incoherent thoughts from my personal experience. I feel like one thing was trusting myself that I can handle foreign situations and strangers, because I've been in that situation before and I always got through it. That I always came back. Another thing was just indulging in interests that I objectively know are there, reading the same book for the tenth time, watching my favourite episodes again, and while that's escapism to some point, it kinda grounds me because it's familiar and always makes me feel less alone, because I'm so emotionally invested.

I transitioned from being a very externally projecting PwBPD to a  very inward projection when my Best friend w/benefits got pregnant the first week the benefits started. I played the part of perfect husband/father for 9 years until I couldn't do it anymore, and my demons devoured me. OK, enough about that, and im very close to remission. So in my recovery, Ive noticed awareness is a major part of our MEDICAL condition, that is pretty much non-existent. And shutting down, what people really think about us, is kinda counter productive.

I lot of people hate public speaking but learn how to speak when they need to.

Or they have social anxiety but learn to open up over time - they may never be the loudest person on the room, but they are comfortable with who they are and they know they have other skills but can be social if they need to be. 

I’m sure it’s something like that. Like - yeah it’s not exactly my natural strength to trust my bf if he goes away for two weeks. But I’m sure eventually I’ll be able to handle it well enough that it’s not really something I think about - or the automatic thoughts will probably come in and switch on the anxiety - but I’m probably so practiced in handling that stuff that I can calm myself down without anyone else’s help in 5 mins. 

I think it’s a series of tools and habits that become easy to use over time. 

At one point in your life you had to learn all the sounds of the letters and then how they mix up together and make mixed up sounds which are words - and each word has a freaking meaning to learn! But here you are years later reading and writing without thinking about it. Sometimes you’ll come across a new long word and you can like sound it out slowly and speed it up until you can say it and you can look up the definition and then you know that word forever now! It’s sort of like that…

In First grade you wouldn’t know all the letters and sounds and how they work together and they wouldn’t know where to look to figure out the meaning - it might take days to figure out that word when now it takes you 2 mins.

It’s sort of like that. All the DBT skills build up over time and the patterns start being understood without effort. One day it’ll be normal.

Do you have friends that you stopped talking with because of your FP? Start talking with them again. Put time back into the relationships you may have neglected. That includes your relationship with yourself! Do some journaling, watch a crazy ass long tv series and just binge it. Or maybe you can find a “don’t message him” buddy and instead of messaging your FP you can message that other person all the stuff you want to say to your FP. In fact, I have a folder of memes and funny videos that I save stuff to and one day I’ll send them to my FP after I’ve done enough healing. You could write letters to him in your journal and not send them, really get your rage on though, let out all the hurt and the anger. And then what I do after that is I work on radical acceptance. “I accept that right now it’s not good for me or him if I message him. This is my time for healing and to make better habits for myself that way if we ever do get back together we could potentially have a healthier relationship.” The trick to radical acceptance is it has to be based in reality.

I learned something today about BPD that sheds light on another aspect of the disorder that I didn’t realize. This Infograph was posted on Instagram. [https://www.instagram.com/p/CtZWqjmveex/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==](https://www.instagram.com/p/CtZWqjmveex/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)

If people without BPD better understand how people living with BPD struggle through so many complex emotions, we might not judge as much. It takes a ton of compassion and communication, and this clip seemed to explain how I think sometimes. Is any part of this reminiscent of how you think? If so, maybe share it with your friend so that she can see a different side of the situation.

I had a longer response typed out based on my own experiences but I'm not sure they would compare to yours in their depth or frequency... I did however work in psych for a long time and my first tip, because it's easiest to rule out, is self care, which you've already got under wraps. You didn't mention sleep, however. A healthy amount of sleep, and a routine for it, is very important for mood regulation and thus even more so in your case. Beyond that, it may be that for whatever reason your body needs a bit extra at times and so taking the occasional nap may be helpful both in the case that this feeling is a manifestation of tiredness but also to simply ""reset."" Try power naps, no more than an hour, often I wake from those feeling energized.  The other strategy I would recommend, if your feeling is not so frequent but overwhelmingly deep, is to force yourself to do a big distraction - go to a theme park with friends, go skiing, etc, things that are so intense or involved that you're unable to stay in your head. This is obviously not a functional 24\7 answer but with the work you're doing professionally and personally you may be describing, through a BPD lens, what others experience and simply call burnout - it sucks for everyone but your first suspicion obviously goes to ""the same old suspects."" Look into solutions for burnout and even midlife crisis, you may very well be experiencing something totally normal albeit shitty.

Finally, due to your experience with and recovery from BPD you, your age, and where you're at in life, you may be experiencing the standard ""existential crisis."" The ""why are we here? What's the point of this?"" that many go through, myself included. The answers to these questions are deeply personal and individual... For me, the answer is children, family, helping others (like charity but I'm talking more being helpful to people that I know), and legacy, they I'll leave behind and where the world is headed. Every time I work on something within the scope of my end game values so to speak I feel good - when I'm doing nothing on that front I do not feel good (unless, you know, vacation). You may be coming against these questions, due to age, due to being single, due to accomplishing your goals and not knowing what's next...

It’s hard to trust the fact people will be there for you if you open up, and sadly, some won’t be there. That’s life. Opening up might be the hardest thing to do, but with a rational insight to it, you can keep the relations that are healthy and cut off the unhealthy ones. Reminiscing on the past can teach you what went wrong and why. Was it actually your fault? Could be for sure, at least, if you weren’t in recovery and therapy at the time. All in all that doesn’t matter at this very moment. 

As for the calloused skin anecdote, I understand it completely, but your brain is wired to be more emotionally sensitive. Trying to push that away by trying to feel nothing, becomes exhausting and extremely isolating in the present and future. 

It’s hard, but you’ll get to a point it might get easier. I cant tell you it does from personal experience yet, but I do feel like I’m on my way to healthier relationships. Keep going and be kind to yourself :)

The truth is though, as much as I feel that, if we have truly supportive relationships and we learn how to advocate for ourselves through communication with those people, we can expect to see both people trying to improve. Still, more often than not, it does feel like the health of each of my relationships is dependent on me using skills 24/7 and honestly being super critical of myself. Kind of hard for me to not feel depressed with the negative self talk. The phase I’m in now is being constructively critical with myself in the moment but also validating my feelings. Still, it gets really old feeling like it’s not an option for me to just say or do what I truly feel. Because 99% of the time when I finally let myself just do that, I upset or irritate other people, and I only end up feeling more misunderstood. Either way - I don’t feel understood and I feel like I have to hide my true feelings. I know though that working toward remission takes years and I do notice myself making small steps forward when these feelings of being misunderstood or not seen have become less intense and caused less emotional dysregulation/distress.

143ltet,"Sounds like you need a coping card! 

If it was you achieving the thing, how would you want your friends to feel for you? If you achieve the thing, does it mean you are taking away relationships or work opportunities from others? Look at someone you admire - if this happened to them what would be their response? Emotionally? And then how would they respond in person to others?

Write all of this down and distill it down into a statement that is extremely grey.

Something like: when others get into relationships, it has no reflection on my ability or opportunity to be in a relationship. It’s my responsibility to to work on myself and to work to get into a relationship, and I can never actually know what their relationship is like from the inside. It might be great, or it might actually be horrible, I will never know. If I desire a relationship, their getting into one takes nothing away from me. I hope that things go well for them, since their relationship is another opportunity for me to meet a new person, view a relationship that I admire, and perhaps learn from them to better myself.

Keep that statement somewhere on your phone. And when you get these envious feelings - go read it. Over and over until it clicks for you and you can actually feel happy for them. 

There also a DBT skill called “do the opposite”. So if someone texts you with news and you feel pressured to answer right away, but you have feelings of envy cropping up - do the opposite. You don’t need to answer immediately. Take the time to work through you envy with your coping card and then answer when you feel back to normal. There’s no rush!

ALSO: if you are feeling lonely and you pity yourself, then take steps to remedy this stuff. Spend more time meeting people, go workout to improve your self confidence, figure out what makes you feel happy and confident and do it often.

141at88,"As a person who has spent decades finding my way thru mental health issues which were usually summed up with the letters ""BPD"" written in a chart, followed by a pattern of misuse that ended up harming my emotional well-being even further, I have been disturbed by a growing trend of other young people diagnosed with BPD going thru this same pattern of misuse I had experienced.  Cis girls are being diagnosed earlier in their teens with BPD, and being sexually exploited by those who see that diagnosis as an invitation to misuse such girls.  This coincides with a dramatic rise in self-harming behaviors and suicides in teen girls.  

In watching a girl with BPD, and an AMT Backup in her possession, go thru an escalating crisis recently, I couldn't stay silent any longer.  A discussion about protecting those vulnerable young people diagnosed with BPD needs to be started, in my opinion.  Nobody protected me or many others my age, and it had profound consequences for each of us, as well as our offspring.  The trend of re-exploitation is rising, so it is a problem that is not being addressed properly,  if at all.

Here at Reddit, I felt it was logical to start this discussion in active BPD groups.  I am on the spectrum, so I miss cues, and I apologize for not realizing sooner that this particular BPD group had no interest in this subject.  Maybe that means no one here has ever experienced sexual misuse by those diagnosing and medicating them.  If so, that's actually a very good thing.

1400mjq,"I've only been diagnosed about three months ago, but even in that short time dealing with it got better. By now it's a label that helps me navigate symptoms and brings some  
clarity at times. But back then, everything was just a mess and I hated it, because it meant having to acknowledge that this isn't just another depressive episode and everything in the past was so much worse that I could admit - but on the other hand it was a relief, because finally things made a little more sense and I was just not failing as battling depression over and over.  
I know everything feels like shit right now, and you need to know that's okay and you can just sit with those feeling for a while before you have to process them. And while you do that, allow yourself some distraction, watch a cool movie, play a game you like, get your favourite overpriced drink. Starting to process those things is a lot easier when you're not on edge and after that really intense happening, you deserve that, you still have the rest of your life to deal with that. If you feel like you need someone to allow you that, then take it from me, certified stranger on the internet.

Another thing though from personal experience, I did NOT do myself a favour by looking up things online. All the content on Insta/Twitter/Tumblr whatever by other people with the diagnosis talking about it, or the support accounts, or even scrolling through this subreddit for days to no end wasn't a good thing for me. It made me incredibly upset at times, which is not healthy. If you feel like it could help you, go for it of course - but as soon as you notice it's not helping, let it go, you don't have to do everything at once.  
When everything has settled a little, you'll see that this doesn't make you a different person, just that you now have more tools that can help you to feel less bad. If you haven't looked into skills yet, I recommend doing so, they've helped me a lot, even before the diagnosis, when I didn't even know what DBT was or that they were part of that.

Do you recognize that checking out, whether out of the ward or out of existence -- are counterproductive actions? Telling your coworkers that you don't want to work with them is counterproductive as well. Is telling them or sending them the email going to make your life at work any easier? It seems to me that you should not seek discharge if you still want to act against your own interests. 

The same may go for meds, although I'm not a psychiatrist. I don't know if I'd recommend restarting sertraline, changing to another medication or adding another to the sertraline. Feeling that you don't *deserve* to feel better is another self-destructive behavior and indicates to me that leaving isn't a good idea.

It's probably better for you to take *something."" In any case, abruptly stopping sertraline is not recommended: the risks are significant, and that one of those risks is depression. Would you say that feeling like you don't deserve to feel better might be a symptom of depression? Of course it is, right?

It’s hard for sure, it’s painful, and it affects your days incredibly.” Take the time for yourself to be aware of why exactly you’re having this recurring nightmare, it’s either something you miss in your life as of right now, or simply nothing more than a nightmare. Looking for the cause of your distress is very helpful in dealing with it.

prioritize sleep, exercise, and eating well - although it might seem negligible those play a massive role in how well we can control our emotions. 

however, you should also talk to them. explain how you're trying to get better but that it's a process and you can't be expected to magically get better immediately. if they feel as strongly towards you they should understand and be willing to help. ask them to communicate when things hurt them, but you can also communicate what things trigger you so they could be a bit mindful of that.

And even once you find what works for you, it’s going to take a loooong time for you to be able to use them in times of crisis. I hope your SO understands that getting better isn’t a fast process. It takes a lot of time, and you’ve got to train yourself to react appropriately when you don’t feel good.

My coping skills are mostly distraction and redirection exercises. Listening to loud music on headphones, coloring, going for a walk, spending time in a small safe space. Also I journal out all the negative thoughts I would usually say out loud, then tear them up and throw them away. 

You can’t ‘remove’ your triggers, that’s impossible. However you can train yourself to react more positively, or at the very least, not have a meltdown about it. 

I hate to say this…. But you’re going to have to step up your self control. A lot. If you want to keep them in your life, you’re going to have to make yourself get up and use your skills. There’s no easy way, no shortcuts. Sheer force of will is what it will take. It’s so fucking hard dude. I’ve been there, and still there now. But over time, it gets easier to pull from your coping skills and you don’t have to force yourself so much. 

You’re simply not going to get better immediately unless you really get your act together and start forcing yourself to react better to your triggers. No excuses, no ‘I don’t feel like it’ etc.

Im betting they love you, and I’m betting that leaving you won’t be an easy choice for them. But they are absolutely right in that they deserve to be treated better.

13twhcv,"I have moderate BPD. I’ve been in therapy for almost two years, and on medication for 8 months now.

I do not like the way my medication has made me feel lately. I’ve been doing some research for a more natural route and found some interesting benefits of Ashwagandha, Magnesium, and B6 specifically for BPD symptoms. I already take magnesium for my health, but I also use the app Headspace in the mornings for guided meditations and try to shoot for daily yoga, if I can’t get my yoga in I’ll do a quick mediation with breathing exercises. 

To offer guidance to you and your loved one;
Abandonment is our number one trigger. You’ve now been made aware there is a possibility that you may be abandoned by the one person you thought was going to be there forever. Communication is very important, as well as a persons mental health. I understand they may need to do what is best for them. If they desire the forever as you do, communicate that gently. You need to be sure you’re both creating a secure attachment for each other. It is not a solve all, but it’s a strong start. Clear communication, trust and holding each other accountable to that will definitely help. Actively listen, do not defended yourselves when explaining how one is feeling, do not invalided each other. All of these will lead to triggers and one not being heard. Keep a journal for your eyes only if this helps, write in it about every feeling you have. This can help pin point feelings that you may not have words to describe them.

This advice was all from my therapist over the years, it has helped me immensely. I still have my days but I have more understanding of how to help care for myself. Really take the time to learn your triggers and describe them to yourself on what a specific word, phrase, or look can cause you to lash out and become angry. If you’re anything like me, I would become very angry and I really despised that about myself, I would say the most cruel and hurtful things to my significant other. I regret it very much…thankfully he has been so understanding and compassionate over the last 6 years it’s really helped and eased my symptoms of abandonment knowing he is always there for me, but he is sure to hold me accountable and has learned with me over the years to know when an episode could potential happen.

The best thing about your post is that you acknowledge when you’ve done something that has hurt someone, you are aware of your actions. Wanting to better yourself in any way possible it a very strong start. I hope this helps guide you in a direction that offers you abundance.

The yoga channel I follow on YouTube is Yoga With Adriene. She has playlists for every months that are free.

Start figuring out where the tender parts of your heart are. Once you uncover some triggers you can start making a plan for how you’ll act when your upset in those moments.

For me I take a lot of time away to settle down. Even if it takes hours that’s ok? The important thing is you take that space and don’t create more damage while upset in the deep feelings that come up.

As some folks have mentioned, it's helpful to communicate your triggers to your partner and ask them to consider them. Although we can be challenging to be with, every relationship requires effort and support from both sides.

However, on a side note, individuals with BPD tend to idealize their partner, considering them their favorite person, and may believe they won't find anyone else like them. The truth is, there are plenty of people out there who may be just as good or even better.

When you begin Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and learn how to be comfortable being alone and the peace that comes with it, as well as how to become emotionally independent from your partner, your perspective will become clearer and more rational.

As someone with BPD, I can assure you that recovery is indeed possible. However, it's important to acknowledge that it won't be an easy journey. The key to recovery lies within yourself, as you need to actively work on improving and grounding yourself, as well as changing your thought patterns and perceptions. It requires consistent effort from you.

It's crucial to understand that while help and support from others may be available, you shouldn't rely solely on external assistance. The primary responsibility for your recovery rests with you. It's essential to take ownership of your healing process and not expect others to do the work for you, even if assistance is offered.

Remember, your commitment and effort in working on yourself will play a significant role in your path to recovery from BPD",Teesamaha,False,1685356650.0

13pc2a7,"BPD was added to my list of diagnoses several years ago after I finally spilled the beans about the fact that the reason I'd checked myself back into the psych hospital was because my therapist had been raping me (not that I was willing to actually call it that at the time). 

These assholes go into fields where they are in positions of power (health care, mental health care, education, military, etc). They know what traits and vulnerabilities to look for when seeking out new prey. 

It's a very real problem that is not addressed nearly often enough and is more often than not dismissed. The rapists in these fields know that and use it to their advantage as well. 

I lost years of life to that and have had to work my ass off to get as far as I have. I'm lucky that the psychiatrist in the hospital actually believed me and tried to help. I'm also lucky that I was able to find a good therapist after everything went down because I was going to just self delete if the next therapist sucked- I was not willing to put up with any more bullshit at that point in time. A lot of people are not nearly so lucky. 

I try not to think about it too much for too long at this point, but I still feel sick thinking about how many more people my rapist has continued to hurt over the years. All of my reporting attempts back then ultimately went nowhere. The cherry on top was when it was determined that he had not raped me because he said he didn't rape me when he was asked whether or not he raped me. Because, you know, most people would definitely fess up to that kind of crime and would definitely never lie about it. 🙄

So I read ""I Hate You, Don't Leave Me"" and it really resonated. Of course, back then no one would consider a diagnosis in a teenager, and also I wasn't allowed to go to therapy until my suicide attempt at 16... 

I was in and out of treatment throughout college, but mostly out, and by now I understood the BPD stigma enough that I was afraid to mention it because I didn't trust my providers enough not to use it as an excuse to put me in the hospital (I got sent to the ER twice when I wasn't even suicidal, and it was a freaking nightmare).

Anyway, it didn't really come up again until a really bad breakup at 28. A mutual acquaintance asked if I'd ever heard of BPD. Despite that I was still hitting all nine criteria, I basically got laughed at by my psychiatrist for suggesting it. So I took that to mean I *didn't* have it, not that I should find another provider.

It wasn't until I was telling a different psychiatrist two years ago about a particularly bad episode where she was like, ""I'm not *saying* you have BPD, but you would benefit from DBT.""

I had extreme meltdowns/episodes since early childhood. They were a mix of rage, frustration, hurt & desperation all at once. I couldn't calm down on my own whatsoever & nothing seemed to work to make me feel better. I couldn't explain what was 'wrong' during an episode because I had no idea why I felt so bad. Then depression/suicidal ideation got added when I was a teenager. The depression was pretty much constant but would dip to horrible lows. 

I never had any type of mania, euphoria or 'highs'. If I ever felt something close to that, it was only high-energy anger during an episode. I felt super charged rage, never extreme happiness or frantic behavior *outside* of an episode where I was angry/upset. 

My episodes were only triggered around my mom, never anyone else. I begged her for help, she said 'Its just a phase, you'll grow out of it.' I was fine in school & with friends. Then I started dating at 14 & boyfriends would trigger episodes. It became obvious it was just the people who I was extra close with who upset me, but I didn't know why. 

I didn't really have internet access in high school because it was the 1990s so I couldn't easily find info. I heard about bi-polar but didn't think I had it because I never had that time of mania. I thought I had 'depression' with some type of 'anger management' problem. I thought I was the only person in the world with this problem & I didn't think it was it's own disorder. I never heard of 'personality disorders'. I only knew about psychopaths/sociopaths & knew that wasn't it. 

Around 2000, when I was 22, I had a friend who got out of a psych hospital with a BPD diagnosis. She was the only person I knew who had similar problems as I did.  She told me her diagnosis, I looked it up online and it was the first time I saw anything that described my life. But back then, everything I read said there was no known treatment, prognosis was 'poor' & that nothing really seems to help it. It was too depressing to keep reading so I decided to ignore it & just hope it would go away. That's how I first 'knew' it might be BPD.

13g8f5z,"For me it sounds like you have heated arguments and that you both have issues in dealing with anger. If this is his behavior only when he is angry, then I wouldn't be super concerned *if you both are working on things.*

The thing is, BPD or no, people do wrong things when they're angry. You're right to point these out and these should be things _he_  should be working on, because obviously they are not functional ways of venting anger or frustration.

*I* don't find this abusive as long as it's not a constant thing outside of anger & he apologized for things like calling you stupid. If it's in the heat of the moment and apologies are issued from both sides, it's just unfortunate losses of control that don't feel good for either. Breaking things is acceptable as long as the aggression is NEVER directed at you. 

Keep working on them, the both of you. And for the love of everything, NEVER hide something he does continuously and what bothers you. I guarantee it will come out in the worst moments and in all the wrong ways. Keep open communication, always.

Remember that he's not allowed to call you stupid or the things you say as useless or dumb, whether or not he is angry or not. He needs to realize this and apologize. He also needs to work on himself to be able to stop this behavior when it becomes too bad. Naturally the same applies for you, too.

Calling out bad things we do during conflict is not the best idea. I'd recommend when things get heated, just take a break until both of you calm down. Then resume the conversation when neither of you is that heated up anymore and are able to keep up rational responses. Try not to lose your head. I know it's easier said than done but absolute control over every reaction and minute observation is the key.

Discussing what each other did wrong WILL definitely just end up escalating things in the heat of the moment, so definitely at all costs avoid that. And what it comes to the 'gaslighting', I don't think personally that it's gaslighting. Gaslighting is something done maliciously and with the intent to deceive. Your bf seems to honestly be under the impression, that calling some action stupid is not the same thing as calling someone stupid.

We all do dumb things, we all do bad things yet they don't make us dumb or bad people. I understand it feels bad, and therefore your boyfriend should work on not saying those. But I think in this case it's about him not understanding your side and you not understanding his. Not intentional maliciousness.

When discussing who did what, the main things are 1. Both of you need to be calm. 2. Both of you need to be willing to accept each other's side. 3. Good communication. 4. Do NOT accuse. 5. Use phrases like 'when x happened, I felt belittled', NOT 'you belittled me the entire fight!'

So remember when discussing what went wrong: stay in the facts. What happened. How it made you feel. How it made you think. Do not turn your thoughts or feelings into facts. Just because you FEEL insulted, doesn't mean he tried to insult you. Try to see his side too. Remember that y'all are meant to be each other's attorneys, not prosecutors!

[WebMD suggests,](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/black-and-white-thinking)

>**Reframe your thinking.** If you catch yourself jumping to extremes, try challenging yourself. Think about why you might be thinking the way you are and whether there is another viewpoint you may not have considered.

>**Watch your words.** Black and white thinking words like ""always"" and ""never"" are signals to pay attention to. If you hear yourself saying things like that, remind yourself to replace it with different words like ""maybe"" and ""sometimes"".

(A real-life example of this would be talking about how much more you love your partner compared to your ex-wife, to be honest.)

>Acceptance. If there is one constant in life, it's change. Try to be comfortable not knowing everything. It's OK to ask for more time to think about something or say, ""I don't know"".

[This article](https://www.verywellmind.com/dichotomous-thinking-425292) from VeryWell Mind gives us a good example of how black and white thinking can look in the beginning of our new relationships:

>A person with dichotomous thinking may meet a new person at work. In the beginning, the coworker is viewed as amazing, perfect, and better than any other coworker or friend ever encountered before. People with dichotomous thinking tend to have favorites and to believe that everything about a favorite person or thing is superior to others. However, as time goes on, someone with dichotomous thinking may suddenly swing to the opposite extreme.

Your current partner is your new person, and right now you're inclined towards putting them on this tall pedestal (""I'm happier with her than with anyone else, she's better than my ex!"") as a result of this dual thinking.

It's specifically because of this tendency to put people on this pedestal that, when the illusion is broken, you might wind up thinking about how terrible they were, how you want nothing to do with them, etc.

So the trick is to try to train your brain to realize that not only does the middle ground exist -- it's where you need to be. As sad as it is, *everyone* is going to disappoint you in some way -- including the person you're with now. That doesn't mean they aren't good for you -- it just means they make mistakes just like you do. 🩷",General_Ad7381,False,1683764472.0

13d9dgq,"I know what you are feeling. I have spent years feeling helpless, suicidal, isolated, empty, and all of the feelings and experiences you are having.

You and I are not alone.

&#x200B;

I am finally beginning to heal, feel better, stop living with more or less constant suicidal ideation, self-harm, experience emotions etc. I believe that you can heal as well. Keep trying to get into an intensive outpatient program (that's what you mean by IOP, right?). It was my dedicated participation in an intensive outpatient program for personality disorders which started my healing after many, many years of misery. I have a long way to go, but I have some tools to heal now, and I am getting better at using them.

If possible, find a therapist who has experience and is comfortable helping people who have personality disorders trauma, and all the kinds of suffering that we experience. More than anything, it was the individual therapy component of my IOP which got me going - I finally became able to look at my incredibly fucked-up childhood and how it influences who I am. I felt truly safe for the first time in my life, and I was able to make myself truly vulnerable. My first therapist became - for a time - the first mother I've ever had. I truly felt/feel that she loved me, and helped me begin to stop hating myself.

I know far, far too well about wanting to be held more than anything in the world. It's a terribly painful and lonely feeling, and likely the source of much of my pain. Last year, by chance, I found a quote which perfectly describes that feeling and the thoughts which accompany it. I still have difficulty reading it. For months, it would make me cry uncontrollably, but as my healing goes on, the less pain it causes me. These days, although it still causes me a lot of pain, it helps me know that I am not alone in feeling this way. The fact that the pain at reading it is, I think, a barometer of how well my healing is progressing. It's all still true, and I still want these things, but I don't get so filled with despair, sadness, grief and regret. I don't know if I will ever have those needs fulfilled, but I feel that I am beginning to be able to face and feel that pain, and that I can begin to parent myself in this way. I would use the term ""re-parent"", but since I was never parented to begin with, it would be the first time, whether someone else or I gave me with these experiences.

At this point, I recognize that I will not have this need filled by anyone else, by drugs or other forms of self-destruction, and that even if I begin to parent myself, the task will never be completed - but that's not only ok, it's true, and that whatever progress I make in parenting myself will give me even more strength and sense of self and compassion for self and others. I also have begun to know (not intellectually recognize) that the more I heal myself, the less self-loathing I will feel, the better my relationships will become, and the more I will begin to love myself.

I am sorry you are suffering so much, but if I can help in any way, please ask. The fact that you have posted here gives me hope for you - it's a level of will to recover and be vulnerable and seek emotional intimacy which I have never been able to summon (at least until very, very recently).

If anyone reading this needs help finding an IOP for personality disorders, please ask. In fact, maybe we - as a group - could create a master list of programs. If you are in NYC, I strongly recommend the [Center for Intensive Treatment of Personality Disorders.](https://www.mountsinai.org/locations/west/care/psychiatry/citpd) It changed my life (and is where I began working with the therapist I mentioned above). It is a time-limited program (up to 2 years), but it changed my life, as well as the lives of many of the other clients I met there.

So - the quote. I apologize if it is too painful to read. Even if it is, please remember that you are not alone, and that the reason it hurts so much is because you are not alone, and are understood.

""And he cries and cries, cries for everything he has been, for everything he might have been, for every old hurt, for every old happiness, cries for the shame and joy of finally getting to be a child, with all of a child's whims and wants and insecurities, for the privilege of behaving badly and being forgiven, for the luxury of tenderness, of fondness, of being served a meal and being made to eat it, for the ability, at last, at last, of believing a parent's reassurances, of believing that to someone he is special despite all his mistakes and hatefulness, because of all his mistakes and hatefulness.""

13d3jen,"TBH I'm jealous of people who can identify specific traumatic experiences which triggered their PD, even if it was something which happened repeatedly. My own experience wasn't like that at all. My trauma developed through a more or less constant grinding down which began shortly after birth (literally - I can give details in a DM to whoever is interested, but I'd rather not put it completely out in public).

Even when I was a little kid, I was jealous of kids who got beaten. I remember once begging my dad to hit me because I knew that (a) it would hurt less, and (b) would have a distinct beginning, middle and an end. I was about 6 at the time.

Unsurprisingly, my PD is complex, with symptoms all over cluster B, and has been seriously intractable, although after two years in an intensive outpatient program for PDs, I've finally begun to make some progress. I've also done some self-treatment which has worked extremely well for me (again, I won't discuss it in public, and strongly feel that I can't recommend it to anyone, even though it's worked for me and an increasing amount of research strongly suggests that it's helpful *in clinical settings* ).",Cascando-5273,False,1683662490.0

13czm9m,Why are you with them if they’re abusing you?!,,False,1683654508.0
13czm9m,"I did the same under roughly the same circumstances. My ex had many toxic traits prior, but once my health started failing (while I was quite young) he really become controlling and cruel. Before he became violent with me, he became extremely verbally and psychologically abusive, getting up in my face while I begged and cried to have space because even prior to knowing I had BPD I could feel myself losing control. He’d physically corner me or hold me against a wall, or sometimes just “confiscate” my keys and phone so that if I left I’d be licked out in an unsafe place until he decided to let me in again. He made me feel extreme guilt for my failing health as if I was inflicting it upon him by choice. We had been living together for over three years at this point and were relatively serious, but I found out very quickly that if I was a burden he’d kick me out on the streets. 

All of my income (for the couple years I was still able to work after my disability crept in) went to him and was controlled by him. I did not have a support system in my violently abusive and transphobic family (note: I’m nonbinary). Coming out right before my health became disabling had alienated me from most of my social circle. My ex also let his dealer hate crime me (beat the shit out of me) in our apartment while preventing me from calling 911 as well, but that’s a whole other story. This is just to paint a picture of how little control I had in my life and as my health got worse and eventually I was unable to work my choice became increasingly clear: suffer the abuse indefinitely or at least as long as he doesn’t get bored of me OR become homeless with significant health issues that would make survivability on the street highly unlikely… or to be more concise, my second option was to kill myself. And that’s exactly what I planned on doing when exiting the relationship, though I was extremely lucky that a near stranger saved my life and helped me get the care and stability I needed. 

Sorry, that was too much context before actually getting to the point, it’s just hard to keep all the memories and feelings from resurfacing when I talk about this time in my life. Anyway, I don’t actually know how many times I initiated the violence with him, but I do remember what led to it and what followed it. As I said he would physically corner me and scream in my face, sometimes grabbing me so I couldn’t move (both of these things are definitely on the threshold of physical abuse as they directly prevent the other person’s bodily autonomy). He would mock me and laugh at me while I cried. I’d beg him to stop, beg him for space, which he never gave me. 

When I was lucky I would fully dissociate (just like when I was a kid and my mom screamed at me for hours for my tone of voice, never letting me go to my room to calm down so I could deescalate properly) and he would get bored of my lack of response and dead eyes. But that’s not something I can control. It’s a learned response to being put into fight/flight mode, but other times, since flight was physically impossible, my body would choose fight. This would usually occur when my brain couldn’t function beyond “make it stop make it stop make it stop” and without my full conscious awareness I would slap him. It was wrong and I felt terrible (I’ll get to that in a minute) but this often was his goal. He intentionally antagonized, degraded, scared, humiliated me until I snapped and slapped him so that he could beat the shit out of me (his significantly disabled partner with a delicate spinal condition) until I couldn’t stand. 

He convinced me that because I was the first to hit I was the abuser in our relationship. And I believed him. This is horseshit for a lot of reasons. He purposefully trampled my boundaries (like give me space when I’m asking or begging for it), physically intimidated and boxed me in, and then used everything he knew about my vulnerabilities and fears to sabotage my wellbeing until I was hysterical beyond words. These are not incidental actions, they were repeated in this way with intent. He wanted to hurt me, but he wanted me to believe that it was my fault. And honestly, even if it hadn’t come to him being physically violent with me, his intentional treatment of me this was would not be okay. “He’s emotionally abusive and extremely controlling, but I slapped him so I’m the abusive one” - No. People like him thrive off of the myth of mutual abuse. Most relationships with each party committing abusive actions are not a case of two equally abusive people who are equally responsible for the harm in the relationship. Most relationships like this are cases of one party antagonizing the other and exploiting their weaknesses in order to goad them into retaliatory action and then leave them with the blame for a situation the other person started with the intent to cause harm.

Which leads me to begging you to get into individual therapy. Couples counseling isn’t therapy and it is DANGEROUS for you to go to therapy with your abuser. You are just giving them more material to psychologically abuse you with! Obviously you need to leave him. Neither of you should be in a relationship for a fucking while. You need to meaningfully address your past experiences of abuse and how you feel about this one, as well as learn to establish and defend boundaries before it is safe (for either party) to enter a relationship. Do you have support or are you in a situation closer to where I was? Don’t wait until your choosing between staying or suicide, exit as soon as possible, and if you are in that type of situation there are still options for you. 

I highly recommend posting this to r/JustNoSO which is an excellent support community for all kinds of relationship troubles from mundane arguments to divorce to extreme abuse.

13b13zw," Oh OP I know this feeling well. When I’m angry I rarely lash out on others and instead take it out on myself, but the anger is more comfortable at least for me because it is an activating emotion. Sadness and emptiness are immobilizing, and thus it feels like there is nothing you can do about it. Personally I try to invest the sadness into creative outlets. I make music, for example. I think I would try to do something like that, or if you aren’t into art, try to think of things you usually like to do. If you don’t feel like doing any of them really, start with the thing that repels you the least. You might find from there that you have more energy to do other things. Or do you have a pet? Snuggling my cats always helps a little too. I try not to rely on other people since I don’t have many friends and I tend to overwhelm them. Whether that’s my fault or theirs, I don’t know, but it’s just a sad, sad reality that people won’t be there for me how I need them to be.



But I think at the end of the day, you just have to radically accept the sadness or anger. That’s what I truly have trouble with. I want to blame somebody for how bad I feel—others or myself.

The only thing I have to say about being undiagnosed is that some of the symptoms can be from other issues. A lot of people get misdiagnosed and things like CPTSD, Bi-polar etc can have similar issues to BPD (or even groups of other diagnosis can mimic the BPD symptoms).  I’m not a doctor and I’m not your doctor but that is something to keep in mind. 💖

That being said, you know yourself better than anyone else does. Trust your gut. Look into free resources and see what is out there. Even if you don’t have BPD, DBT could still be really helpful for you! (There are free PDF versions of the DBT book and if you go to my profile and look at I believe my last post someone commented the link to the free version for the DBT workbook). I don’t know if you journal or not but writing it all down someplace so you can show your therapist what you are dealing with can be an incredibly helpful tool and can also help you spot patterns and start making some sense of what you may be feeling and the like. I also do like journaling prompts for mental health that I find on Pinterest. There are a lot of resources if you feel like the medical field won’t be helpful to you. 

Ultimately, you are going to be the one who puts all the work to make the changes that you want to see; a therapist is there to help guide you but they are not the end all be all.

133mahz,"Holy Toledo, this is very relatable for me. I’ve had this issue for almost a year, about a guy I’m friends with that I’ve fallen for. He is the most insensitive dick, but at the same time, he’s the most caring, thoughtful, and compassionate man I’ve ever known. It’s all so complicated for me, because of two huge reasons; 1) I get super triggered whenever I develop romantic feelings as I’ve never had a good romantic encounter, be that if I was dating them, if it was one date, confessed, or I just had feelings and kept them to myself, it always ended terribly- heart break, rape, bullying, or them hurling threats my way. And then 2), I’ve always had a habit in classic BPD fashion to either worship or demonize a person, especially someone I have feelings for. This dude can be so hurtful (albeit unintentionally, due to his mental issues being just as bad as mine, and anger and a mean sense of humor to boot), but he also has done things and said things and helped me in ways nobody- especially no guy- has ever done for me before. Even after a horrendous argument, he’s still my friend AND more importantly, he helps me out when I really need it, even if we’re not on good terms. This guy is so hard for me to know what to feel about and it’s been tearing me apart for months, I go from hating him to loving him within a day sometimes, and this couple of pages just feels so… directed at me. Like, I can be friends with him, but he’s not for me romantically.

133mahz,"I relate to the second paragraph for sure, but I'm having a hard time parsing the author's point in the first paragraph even in the context of the third paragraph providing what seems like helpful context. How do you interpret the first paragraph?

> The truth is that what is not right for you will never remain with. Though might to pretend that you don't know if this is the the case, you do. You can feel it. It's why you have to grip so hard and with so little give. The things that are right for you can be free from you. You don't have to convince them that they are right. You don't have to line up the evidence as though you're pleading a case.

This seems obviously to be about identity formation and not accepting things which foreclose the possibility of growth or ever coping with the suffering. Ok, but ""the things that are right for you can be free from you"", what does this mean? Does she mean that you don't have to convince yourself or others that things are right for you? If the first, that seems hard to square for me logically. Maybe the point is basically ""follow your heart?"" In terms of others, I wouldn't be able to argue that point; certainly copying others because you're too insecure to decide on your own preferences is a pattern in my life.

You deserve it. Unequivocally. 

**Disclaimer: Unsolicited Advice Ahead**

Practice telling that to yourself. Practice forgiving yourself through mindful self-compassion in general. This is a powerful way to cope and opens the door to compounding improvement.

The three parts of self-compassion according to Kristen Neff, a noted author and authority on the subject itself:

1. Reframe things and your self-talk bit by bit so that you comfort rather than shame yourself, like a good friend would
2. Tap into your common humanity. Use cognitive empathy to imagine that elsewhere in the world people go through similar things. Note that this is NOT supposed to engender thoughts of feelings of shame in a ""think of starving children in the developing world"" sense.
3. Try to develop a practice of mindful, non-judgemental awareness of your emotions.

132hnv0,"BPD takes years and years to 'recover from'. As it is literally our personality, one month of therapy does not change that. You and your bf needs to realize that it's a long process. You are also capable of a relapse, and I believe most BPD people do experience a relapse at some point.

You have not regressed to anything, as there is no stages of recovery. We do not recover, we change our thought patterns and behavioral patterns gradually over years. This allows us to 'recover', in the sense that we finally get out of the toxic circle that we create for ourselves and manage to find balance. In addition to this we learn emotion control, which makes everything easier.

We are who we are. We can change, but it takes time. If he doesn't like who you are, then I don't think you're a good match. You sound like an empathetic person, and honestly he sounds horrible.

This is a quick pit to fall in, whether he does it consciously or not. Every time he disagrees with something or wants you to do something, saying 'have you gone back to your old self?' seems like a quick and easy way to get what you want. He may not realize it, but I would be careful if I was you. You might want to talk about it.

And finally, I want to say this. _The way we feel about things ARE NOT WRONG_. We lack the capability of processing and controlling our emotion. But we are not living in an imaginary world where we are dictated by insanity. You have a right to feel the way you do. You are equally as sane as he is. It's how you _act_  what counts.

12ypkfd,"First, I am so sorry about what you're going through. 
No one deserves that.

Second, people's BPD can manifest in so many different ways. We're not a monolith. Some people may be more likely to be abusive toward their favorite person, but others are much more likely to wind up with an abuser as their FP. 
I have BPD myself and part of the trauma that gave me it was being raised in a broken home. Both my parents had toxic and abusive traits, and I'm very certain one of them had undiagnosed BPD. 
Speaking as a child of dysfunctional parents, it's not necessarily a better choice to stay with their other parent. A unified family is not the best option if the parents are toxic or abusive to each other.
You should also know that your child will be at a greater risk of developing BPD if he's being raised by someone who has untreated BPD. Or any sort of abusive or neglectful parent.
 It might present a bit differently because he's male, so it's important to be on the lookout for signs he's developing it or any other long-term issues like CPTSD. He's also automatically prone to developing it if he's already a sensitive child. 
No matter how much you love this woman, the safety and well-being of your child needs to come first. Even if it's not with both parents. You need to take the steps to make sure the cycle isn't repeated. Even if your son doesn't develop it, you probably wouldn't want to see him in a relationship like the one you're in. Don't show him that this is okay. 

The insight on how she treats you vs others: 
She treats other people better because she sees them differently. She puts you on a pedestal and when you show any signs of not being the caricature she has of you in her head, it's devastating. The love that people with BPD feel can be similar to that of a child's, and one of the reasons the love for a favorite person can so easily become an obsession. 
It's a disorder that emotionally stunts people, and building emotional intelligence your brain lacks takes time and effort. 
 She may not understand how unfair or detrimental that is to you. In the moment when she's going off, it's likely her own emotions blind her to other people's. 

She absolutely needs treatment. That's a fact. She's unlikely to change without it, even if she does make an effort. It's just too hard on your own to break your patterns.
 DBT won't solve BPD, but it can be invaluable for recognizing and breaking patterns of toxic behavior. She may need regular psychotherapy before that, though.

 If she doesn't decide to try it or tries it, quits and refuses or puts off finding another therapist, you need to leave. No room for leeway. It's not her fault her trauma manifested this way, but it's her responsibility to make sure others don't suffer because of it.

Please don't stick around because you love her. I'm not saying she doesn't feel love for you, but that feeling of love on its own is not enough to fix your relationship. 

First and foremost, prioritize the safety of yourself and your child. You love her, but you also love your child. And that means protecting him, even if it's from the person you love most.",Sun_and_Shadow_,False,1682461733.0
12ypkfd,"TBH, that is a loaded question when you're talking abt someone with a personality disorder. Truth is it can be perceived that way and is more often than not. The person they love see's it and experiences it more than others bc they are with that person more than anyone else and are also the person closest to the intimate core wounds they have so there are more instances of episodes. They subconsciously look to their partner (or FP) to regulate their emotions. BPD is not just a disorder of emotions but also a disorder of relationships, especially intimate ones. Also add in compounded trauma and impaired ability to emotionally regulate themselves bc of a lifetime of acting how they feel. Yip, complicated mess. No one deserves abuse in any way, period.

12w2uzx,"First, you should realize that a lot, probably most, of the people who've called you crazy have some sort of mental health issue of their own. Some probably just as serious as BPD, even if they're unaware. 

 As you continue with DBT, one thing you might realize is just how much of the population lacks emotional intelligence. Ours is more significant than most, but a lack of emotional intelligence is a societal issue as well as a personal one.

Unfortunately our BPD minds can be impatient, and that plus the black-and-white thinking can cause an, ""I don't see the desired results, therefore it's not working."" 
But DBT takes time, along with work. If it was instantaneous, it wouldn't truly be changing your patterns. They took years if not decades to form, and they'll take time to learn to control. 

 On society/other people being assholes: 
I don't mean to say that everyone else is the problem or that BPD is not a significant mental illness. But that most of the stereotypes surrounding BPD don't fit everyone  with it, and the most harmful traits can also be found in people without BPD, or without any diagnosis. 

Recognizing that there's a problem doesn't fix that problem, but you can't work on the problem without recognizing it. 

When it comes to shame, realize you didn't have a choice in developing this disorder. But that doesn't mean you have no choice at all. No one said it'd be an easy decision, but it is a decision. 

It's not fair that you should have to work to keep the pain you're in from transferring to other people or fight the blame you constantly put on yourself. It truly isn't. 
But the alternative is not better for yourself or anyone else.

The biggest thing, is realize that having BPD means it will require work to be good to both others and yourself. 
But you're not doomed to be miserable or a horrible person, even if it's a lifelong condition.

Quiet BPDs may be able to control their reactions outwards, but that doesn't still mean you have good emotion control. It contains so much more than that. You also need to be able to calm the storm _inwards_, because _that_  is the source of our struggles. DBT focuses a lot in what's happening _in_  you, and how you can use your body to calm your mind. 

I'm not ashamed of who I am. I have used my DBT skills: applied a meaning to my disorder. I became borderline because in the environment where I grew up to be, I had to be what I am. I would not have survived or I would have had a fate significantly worse had I not developed borderline. Now I am not in that environment anymore and don't need it to survive.

It’s normal to still have those feelings even when traits are less apparent. It’s really good the traits of BPD are more subtle, it’s normal. Regardless, your thoughts and feeling matter, because BPD is internal, but in a lot of cases, it *can* become external. That’s why even if it’s subtle (which is great) work on the internal stuff!!!

Reading posts from people who stayed with their partners for years while they worked through their issues made me second guess for a while if I was so inherently unlikeable that someone just up and left when I talked about things that were painful to me. 


To answer your question, almost all of the burdening I did was talking to the other person when my family said or did painful things to me. They said I take it to heart and I should be cutting off my family instead. Which is difficult for me considering most of my family has cut me off already and I desperately want to be loved by the few who still talk to me. 


I could have been less emotional when old traumas came up. And I could also be with someone who has more empathy and is in a place to allow me to be vulnerable.

Johann Hari's book Lost Connections talks about 9 causes of depression & anxiety and possible solutions. It is a fascinating read so I'd strongly recommend reading it. I think it can get you to start thinking in a way where you can alter your thinking patterns accordingly to what you desire your actions to reflect.

12tew4x,"I have a mixed PD and depression. I have extensive experience with psychedelics and am an avid reader of the academic literature. I have been taking these drugs for about 45 years on a fairly regular basis. I have the most experience with mushrooms and LSD, but have also tried several other similar drugs. Here's my take.

I find moderate doses of mushrooms or high-quality LSD to be tremendously helpful if I treat the experience seriously. I take time to prepare for the experience, have the experience, and take time to process it. 

I don't recommend that anyone take psychedelics. They are powerful, and sometimes overpowering. Their psychological impact can be profoundly distressing or profoundly liberating, and they can overwhelm people. They've not infrequently overwhelmed me. If you choose to try psychedelics, please be careful. Stay safe and with at least one sober person you trust. The person should be someone who will give you space, companionship and protection, and is willing to spend 10 hours with you. I can go into greater detail about procedures and dosages recommended in the literature and my personal experience if requested.

I take a number of prescribed medications for my PD and my depression, and have had a moderate number of ECT treatments. ECT works well for my depression, and for the hopelessness arising from my PD, but it doesn't help with the real problems. ECT is also pretty extreme although not dangerous. 

I get better results from mushrooms or LSD than from ECT or psychotherapy alone. I get the best results from doses which comprehensively open my thinking, feeling and perspective, yet leave me clearheaded and articulate enough to process thoughts, emotions and sensations in real time. Ego death is too much for a therapeutic experience. 

My mood, and more importantly, my levels of emotional openness and self-acceptance (my psychological health, if you want to put it that way) rise dramatically during and after a trip, and the effects can last anywhere from 2 to 6 months. In other words, in my case, about 5 trips yearly is about right. My entire self-concept improves and stabilizes.

I think it's important to say that my experience is mine alone. There is not much research on PDs and psychedelics, although very recently there's some work coming out of Switzerland, Netherlands and Italy. Don't play with fire, kids, ok?

An episode would usually be the thing that happens once you get upset & feel out of control. When I get upset, sometimes it continues, I keep getting triggered & things escalate wildly which is what I consider an 'episode'. 

I have extreme anxiety & panic attacks anyway and a BPD episode has things in common w/ a panic attack. Main similarity is my total lack of ability to calm down. Anxiety/fear might be involved but more so, it's rage or unbearable pain/despair. Sort of like agitated depression that explodes & spirials outta control. It's every negative miserable emotion at once, all turned up top volume where I want to smash things, people, myself, I might scream/cry uncontrollably, hyperventilate, get paranoid, feel desperate for it to stop. It's just a complete emotional overload/meltdown. Some are way more destructive than others. When I was younger, that could go on for 5-6+ hours. The older I got, the shorter the episodes became. 

For me, it typically involved an argument with someone else, usually my mom or a boyfriend. I wasn't really triggered by anyone else in that way.  A thing or occurrence could initially trigger me but what really pushed me over was when another person somehow becomes involved in it.

I've been splitting my entire life but never knew what the term was referring to until a couple years ago.

12rolri,"Your reactions, like your emotions, are valid. Are the actions you take as a result of your feelings and reactions helpful? If they are harmful, who is being harmed? Do you include yourself in the list of people potentially harmed?

More people should distrust themselves. People seem to routinely overlook, ignore or deny their true motivations. I certainly do. It's wise to be skeptical; both rose-colored glasses and jaundiced eyes are the enemy. The problem arises (in my experience) when I let my self-distrust be controlled by my self-loathing, when I allow my self-distrust to become self-obsession, or when my self-distrust become kneejerk cynicism. I am know I am vulnerable to these limiting and destructive thought, and I let them become excuses for inaction and negativity. If you can use your self-distrust, it's good. If you let your self-distrust use you, then it's a problem.

I experience one other problem due to self-distrust: I frequently don't trust my own identity. Having an unstable identity and self-concept are par for the course for people with PDs, and examining them is a road to healing; letting my doubt feed my self-loathing isn't. 

To return to my metaphor of glasses: I need to acknowledge the fact that I have myopia and astigmatism. Not treating my eye problems is harmful and leads to worsening vision.

12rolri,"I can relate to this. intrusive and suicidal thoughts are not something we choose to have - they often show up as a way to cope with what we are experiencing. For example, if I’m in extreme distress, thinking about self-harm or suicide can be a short-term way to reduce the pain I’m feeling. It can be comforting knowing I have a “way out”.

What if instead of trying to push the intrusive/suicidal thoughts away, you accepted them? Accepting them does not mean that you act on the thoughts, it just means that you acknowledge that they are there.

When we try to push away distressing thoughts, they tend to come back in more intense ways. Instead we can approach these thoughts from a place of validation and self-compassion. It’s okay to have these thoughts, you are a human and this is your brain’s way of helping you cope. You can even thank your mind for trying to help you cope.

This may look like saying something to yourself like:
- “It makes sense why I am experiencing these urges given that I am going through this…”
- Just because I am experiencing these thoughts, doesn’t mean that I need to act on it and I can do things to help myself e.g., distraction

12rolri,"I hear you and can relate. What's truly helped me most is exploring what is underneath the things that trigger me and healing from the roots. Understanding where triggers come from can help us validate ourselves and move forward.

For example, if someone close to me cancels our plans, anger is the emotion that will often come up for me. What's usually underneath that anger is a belief I hold about myself, such as ""No one really likes me"", ""I'm unloveable"". I formed this belief because of the experiences I had growing up. Once I was able to get to the root of things, it helped me realise that these were things I had internalised - they were not the real me. 

Through therapy and self-reflection, I was able to start challenging these beliefs and process (some of) the past to help me move towards healing. I have found that a lot of the things that would have really triggered me in the past don't as much anymore, and when I do get triggered, I have skills to cope.

Bad therapist, that's not how people work. They are expecting you to bow to their authority rather than care about you authentically understanding yourself. But that would, in my amateur perspective, create eternal dependency on relying on others to tell you what's right. You need to understand how they got there. That often requires a little discussion.

*but it feels impossible to me to just accept what they say without going into detailed explanations. And they stop me, because they know and understand how I feel, and it’s not important, we need to change the scheme, I might be dumb, but it’s not obvious to me that the other person know what I feel, so I don’t try to argue, I just try to paint the whole picture of my interior world. How could I make my brain more flexible?*

Again, I'm no therapist. But I cannot imagine any worthwhile therapy that expects a ""yes sir""/""no sir"" approach to things. 

*But my therapist said we might not be compatible, if I question everything, and don’t trust their knowledge, and they like to move faster, we should have achieved something by now, instead of going over my same emotions.*

They're dictating at you instead of making sure you authentically understand and implying therapy should be moving at *their* preferred speed? 

Again I've never done schema therapy, but I'm not sure I understand conceptually one where they just tell you things, expect you to blindly nod along even though you don't understand, and then incorporate that meaningfully.",Ok_Skill_1195,False,1681837220.0

12pcyax,"i was able to go from full blown bpd to quiet, manageable bpd without medication, formal cbt/dbt, or specialized therapy. how? honestly just by working really fucking hard and really wanting it. the good news is that you making this post means you really want it so you’re part way there. 

before i jump in: this has been the culmination of eight years of work. so do not expect results overnight. but i’ll get into that more later. 

first and foremost, stop telling yourself this is incurable. you can recover. you absolutely can get better and stop hurting others. you will always have a voice in your head that sucks and tells you terrible things, but you can stop that voice from hurting you or your loved ones. if you don’t have a growth mindset with bpd you will never improve. no part of you is immutable. you can and will change. 

if you don’t journal, start. if you do journal, do it more. keep a simple mood diary (i like daylio) to track big changes and give yourself perspective on the big picture. but also, get a regular paper journal and start writing about your feelings when you’re spiraling or the intrusive thoughts are particularly loud. the best information you can have is knowing yourself, and journaling is a great way to start paying more attention to what you do.** self-awareness is bpd’s kryptonite**. even something as simple as figuring out how long your intense emotions last can be so helpful— for example, i can now tell my partners to wait ten minutes for me to calm down because i know that’s how long the swing lasts. the more you identify and realize your own thought patterns, the easier it is to break out of them (we’ll get to that in a sec). 

related to self awareness, learn your triggers. notice them. write them down. they’re probably silly and that’s ok. but you need to know what gets you going, and you need to know what it feels like for an episode to start. after you’re done freaking out, think about why. it was probably something silly. it was probably actually a million silly things that all built up. when did it cross the point of no return? when could you have nipped it in the bud?

now let’s talk about breaking out of them. learn some simple breathing exercises. you can look up a bunch or make up your own. the one i do is to start with inhaling, holding, and exhaling just for a 1 count and then incrementally work my way up to an 8 count. breathing exercises are great for regulation because you can do it anytime anywhere. plus, if you are counting your breaths you are not thinking your spiraling thoughts. when you start feeling big emotions coming up, you can breathe through them instead of letting them take you over. the first time you’re able to tell your loved one “hold on a sec i need to do my breathing” instead of snapping and screaming at them, you will feel like a million bucks, i promise. you may find techniques that work better for you than just breathing, but this is what worked for me. the idea is breaking out of thought spirals ASAP. 

ok so now is the harder, bigger lifestyle part. stop dating for a while. this may not apply to you if you are already in a long term relationship or married or whatever but if you are single, stay that way. i know this is the opposite of what you want, but romantic relationships are the hardest ones for us to navigate, and the more stable you are single the better partner you will be. eight years into working on my bpd and my romantic partners are the only ones who see my bpd in its full ugliness. which i’m working on obviously, but still, that’s a testament to how hard it is. 

for me this is actually the hardest part: make an effort to be kind to yourself. celebrate your progress. let yourself regress sometimes. in addiction, people say that relapse is just a step on the road to recovery. you will be doing great and improving, and then something will happen that will make you act like a 14 year old again. this is ok. this does not mean you haven’t improved. the bpd monster inside of you wants you to stay in this dark place, but it’s wrong. it doesn’t have your best interests at heart. it doesn’t have the best interests of your loved ones at heart, either. but you do.

this is not going to be easy. this is going to be incredibly lonely, because often no one sees your progress but you. but i would give anything to go back in time to me seven years ago, to the me who was sobbing in bed because i thought i’d be *like this* forever, and i wanna shake them and tell them “no you fucking won’t!” because realizing that i wanted to change and i could change saved my life.

i’m sorry if this is vague and rambly it’s 5am lol. but those are the biggest things that helped me and hopefully they can help someone else too.",plumander,False,1681737071.0

I don't think the problem here is that you're single, because as I said you're making the right choice by turning down potentially abusive relationships, especially given your past. I think the biggest problem right now is you have some really shitty friends that view you as a commodity, not a person.

That being said, I don't know how to help find better friends. I struggle to make and maintain friendships, so I cannot help there.

I know it’s not others’ responsibility to regulate our moods/feelings but there’s something really calming when someone knows that leaving you alone and giving you the space you spitefully demanded for is actually going to cause things to escalate, can detect the shift in your demeanor, just lets you cry in frustration with no judgement, lets you be angry over something small while they figure out a distraction (flipping the argument around and saying something completely obnoxious that it pulls you out of your headspace or just sits with you and plays guitar or whatever).

A common thing i see where this comes up is like a work wife or a close friend that used to be a romantic interest. So in that situation what i'm going to need from my spouse is for them to tell me they feel insecure / uncomfortable with the friendship but want to feel secure and happy so we talk about what i can do about that.

I'd recommend looking into the downsides of you harming yourself, things that matter to you. Short term - can't wear t-shirt, sunny weather. Going to the gym with a friend, can't change. Long term, keloids, scars etc. If you don't care about those, then try to focus on the short term harms.

12d2z7l,"Unfortunately, a lot of autistic women are misdiagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. This is because there are overlapping symptoms, but the difference is looking at the root cause of the symptom, not just the symptom at the surface level.

Women who are Autistic may also have c/PTSD, which can look like BPD to someone who is not specialized in autism, especially if you're high-masking.

If you haven't already, check out embrace-autism.com There are tons of online assessments you can take that include ones for masking as well. They even have a post about BPD vs Autism and how they overlap/why they're misdiagnosed.  
  
This is part of that post that I found really helpful:

**""Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS)**  
Another psychometric questionnaire is the VIA-IS. It looks at personality traits and has been used to investigate personality characteristics consistent with different conditions. Below you can see traits that are low and high in BPD and in autism.\[45\]  


**VIA-IS Character Strengths** ***underused*** **in:**  
BPD: kindness, honesty, self-regulation, prudence, perspective, and love  
Autism: self-regulation, zest, leadership, teamwork, social intelligence  


**VIA-IS Character Strengths** ***overused*** **in:**  
BPD: social intelligence, judgment, bravery, curiosity, and zest  
Autism: honesty, love of learning, perspective, judgment, fairness, prudence  


Based on the patterns in character strengths found using the VIA-IS, in many ways, these two conditions are very different. However, BPD and autism do share a high score in judgement and a low score in self-regulation. Using these character strengths and weaknesses, clinicians can further support the reliability and validity of their diagnoses.""

I don’t think being able to lean on your partner means you need to vent or dump all your darkest thoughts on him.

My husband will get ice for my head or lead me in paced breathing exercises when I’m in crises. If I’m having a black and white moment and raging about something, he may ask me to “check the facts” or to try to phrase what I just said with non-judgement. We meditate together. We come up with cope aheads together, which includes a secret phrase that means, “I’m barely holding it together, let’s get out of here NOW.” 

As for suicidal ideation, I would say that if you know it’s a passing thought, keep it to yourself. If you are a danger to yourself, please tell him or a therapist or someone else.

12atpx0,"Personally I don’t put too much on my partner details-wise. I’ve talked to my partner about what goes on with my mental health before so when it comes to my mental state, I kinda just say “I’m having a rough day, mentally” and that tells them all they need to know to be there for me. If they press more to know what’s going on, then I tell them, but I still keep some of it to myself. Part of the reason for this is because my BPD is so much more manageable when I don’t air out every insecure thought and feeling I have to the world. I don’t tell my partner every time they annoy me either because I don’t want to make them feel insecure or criticized. 

I will talk about the way I view situations, why some things upset me and why I think a certain way, and that’s so he can see my perspective when I do communicate with him. I talk about it matter of factly, like it’s just something I notice (not sure if that’s good or bad), but I try to steer clear of anything that might make the convo too intense. Things like suicide, wanting to break things, and impulsivity.

I learned that SO’s will say they want to be there for you because they want to show you they care, but you can show that you care for them too but not unloading your emotional baggage or mental health problems on them all the time.

129okgu,"First of all, congratulations on your courage to get better!  I wanted to answer this question because I relate to it. 

I have NPD, not sure if I qualify for a full blown diagnosis anymore, but I’m mentioning it to tell you that I understand, empathize, and I’ve been on my own healing journey for about 4 years now.  My ex has BPD, so I understand your plight on that front as well. 

Our dynamic together was very unhealthy when it came down to being able to have emotional maturity or any sort of vulnerability between the two of us.  She was the abuser in the relationship, ironically.  But she only got ragefully angry a few times out of the year, so it was easy for me to avoid and ignore. 

With that said, I actually ended up developing PTSD because when I got to the point in my own healing where I was trying to feel and be vulnerable, she wasn’t able to receive that and her abuse really shattered me at my core. 

We have been out of contact for almost 3 years.   I’ve healed and have developed my own armor and boundaries. 

She got back in contact with me recently, and due to the fact she’s been in therapy, I answered the contact request.  As far as I’m concerned, it’s a clean slate and we are started from 0. I don’t know what will become of us, but I’m just writing to say that reconciliation is possible for you, but it’s not a guarantee. 

I still struggle with trusting her because in our first relationship there were lies. So she would have to prove, consistently, she can be trusted. It’s a struggle for me that I sometimes find myself wondering if this is even worth it simply because life is short and I don’t want to be played a fool for a second time. But when we are in relationships that are damaging to self, this is a byproduct of that. So your “FP” is likely dealing with damage control as well.  There’s probably always going to be a lingering thought your person has as to if you are going to relapse, get too triggered, and harm them in some way.  The only way to overcome that is to continue therapy and continue utilizing your new toolset to deal with life in a healthy manner. 

I find it helpful to take time apart. Months at least.  As you heal you may not even be attracted to this person anymore but it at least allows you to gain clarity and really get on track.",minimalistdesign,False,1680486196.0

Sometimes it feels like my insides are on fire, or like I've been poisoned. In cases like that, weed helps me to calm down a bit, and instead of feeling that searing emotional pain, I feel closer to what I'd assume is a normal amount of emotional pain?

If I'm feeling awful because of a situation, weed helps me be able to view things in a different light, which makes future similar situations easier to handle even without weed. This is also helpful for splitting, as I can actually work through the splitting feelings instead of feeing stuck in them. And if I'm just feeling awful because of like, a general looming bad feeling, weed will help calm me and let me see that there's nothing to worry about.

It completely depends on how you use it. And, in my personal experience, it's better than scrolling social media to numb the feelings, since you're not just ignoring them- You're doing something about them.

My argument would be different for certain other drugs. Alcohol- No good. Shrooms- Probably the best for working out feelings, but can be risky for people with bpd or who need immediate calming.

128ubhw,"i’m in australia, so you can only access cannabis through a Dr., it’s one of the most highly controlled medications here. 

for me, i have BPD, C-PSTD and about a decade long struggle with anorexia. i also have pretty bad insomnia and night terrors due to my C-PTSD. 

to medicate i take 1ml of a full spectrum CBD in the morning, and in the evening 1ml of a 25% THC oil a few hours before bed, and i have a herb vaporiser i probably consume maybe 1 bowls worth of weed in also before bed time. 

i stick to this very rigidly because when i first got my script i was vaping it all the time just to eat. i’ve gotten to a good place in my treatment where i can eat during the day comfortably, and i only take THC to unwind and prevent night terrors, for me THC has been the only effective way for me to stop the night terrors aside from heavy sedatives which impact me a lot more in the morning, so aren’t really an option for me. 

i definitely view my cannabis as medicine, for me i can comfortably manage my dose and i only get a set amount each month so it’s easy for me to not spiral in to the over use a lot of people end up in, understandably so. 

i prefer natural options where i can and i’ve been using cannabis as medicine for almost 2 years now and it’s changed my life in terms of the insomnia, night terrors and appetite. I’m very spiritual so i see cannabis as medicine given by the earth, but i know that’s a hot take lol. 

id say 1. look in to CBD! if i ever needed to go off THC i think CBD would get me through, people definitely overlook it! and 2. if you’re struggling to manage your intake you should try and set a specific dosage amount and see if you can stick to it, if you can’t it may be time to look at alternatives.

I've too, have fallen for other people, although not quite to this extent. I go to therapy two times a week now, for years. I will change myself.

Oh, and developing ""FPs"" (aka people we have developed an anxious attachment style to), is something you should work on. I see a lot of people say that you should make yourself your own FP and I think that's a good advice.

This setback is not the end. You are safe, and whole and worthy, even when you make impulsive and/or destructive choices. My advice would be to not isolate, but do spend time developing your sense of self and figuring out platonic relationships before you look for another romantic one. Get a DBT workbook and therapist you trust and work with both regularly. Do some reflecting on “your life worth living” and then work to make choices and changes that align with that vision. After I did that exercise, I realized I was kinda close… but that my partner at the time was not compatible with my true life goals. Five years later, I’m happily married and living my own “life worth living”.

There's a lot of good workbooks and online resources if not. And maybe the most important thing is to learn to set healthy boundaries. It's very important If you're bound to get a FP, so start thinking whether you should distance yourself from your current one at least for now. 

You also have to be kind to yourself. Acknowledge that you did something wrong, yes, but also try to understand why you did it. For example, I have sometimes had bpd episodes out of deep fear of being left alone. Even though you're always responsible for your actions, you probably have your reasons to act this way. And that's human. You have seen the consequences of your actions, so there's no need to keep punishing yourself for it. Regret is a very important feeling, but it's important to avoid spiraling right now. Instead, use it as a fuel and motivation. Take care of yourself, you're not alone!",bopopbubble,False,1680326643.0
1283p4y,"Putting advice in the foreground for a moment I just want you to let you know you're not alone in doing these sorts of things. If it makes you feel any better I've done the exact same, actually subjectively worse. After developing a FP attachment with a boy I had met in uni I cheated on my boyfriend of 3 years, multiple times. Looking back I think i was using sex to gain the guys affection as I believed sex was the quickest way to connect with people.
 The guilt afterwards was horrendous and I had ended up in hospital a few times feeling as if I'd done something so bad and I was evil and deserved to be punished so I spent months punishing myself.

I only began to forgive myself when I got a support worker who was herself diagnosed with bipolar and told me about her experience cheating on a guy she married after a week off knowing him with his next door neighbor. 
She finished the story by laughing. She told me at the time her life was in ruins and her family and friends judged her, now they look back and laugh. because what else can you apart from except this situation and find a silver lining. 
Finding that silver lining always seems impossible especially in situations like this.
 For me it was realising that the relationship I had destroyed was never as perfect as I remembered it being, BPD was also a massive stressor in my relationship and when it ended I finally had the space and time I needed to work on myself and I don't think I would have ever ended it naturaly.

 I also realised that I was insecure in this relationship and was looking for validation elsewhere, I knew I needed to work on myself much more and find the route of this insecurity.
But you can't ever do that unless you learn to accept this and know Ur not a bad person you just made a pretty bad mistake. 
I think it's also important to remember that outside of this disorder people cheat, normally seemingly healthy people cheat. there's a whole psychology behind that and i won't go into it. But still people do this, the only difference is they don't rip themselves apart afterwards like we do. 

Emotions all around will be very high at the moment and it's definitely best to block the friend and stop anymore contact with him no matter how hard that will be. i know in times like this the loneliness is insufferable but if you use him as a crutch for emotional support you can kiss goodbye too any future possitive interactions with your ex. 

In the end I was able to stay friends with my ex, it took a long time for him to forgive me and rightfully so. I know how much he was hurt by what I did. honestly I still don't think I deserve his forgiveness but he told me he knew I was still a good person because I had done many good things for him.

You're desire for validation is driving this. It's the opposite of rejection sensitivity. When we grow up in environments where our needs feel unmet we use a tool called escapism to survive. We create narratives based on where we have been validated (for me singing). Growing up, I dreamt of being a famous singer because deep down it made me feel like my martyrdom of suffering in my childhood would be worth it. It was a way to avoid the pain of the now I lived in. As long as I lived in the future, I didn't have to realize how many changes were required for me to find authentic happiness in the now.

124kilr,"I have been reading some books and doing a LOT of journaling. It’s more of the slow approach and I’m not sure if it’s helping…I’m trying to get into meditation because it’s supposed to be good for helping you take a step back and being non-judge mental about the thoughts you have which is supposed to allow you some space to look at whether or not your thoughts are helpful etc. Honestly, working a job where I’m active but also have some time to journal here and there has seemed to be helpful? I don’t know I’m so up and down and I have only been doing this for a month or two. 

The books I’ve been reading have been Worthy as You Are by Durgadas Allon Duriel and Tarot for Troubled Times by Shaheen Miro and Theresa Reed. Worthy focuses on weeding out unhealthy beliefs and replanting healthier beliefs that encourage your growth in the direction you want to go. There are some really good journaling prompts and I have started using positive affirmations and gratitude journaling every day because of this book. Sometimes it’s hard to find things to be grateful for especially when my mood is sour but I think it’s getting easier in general which I think is good. It’s my hope that these things will slowly start replacing some of my unhealthier thinking patterns. He also has some really great worksheets in the book about how to challenge difficult thoughts and feelings etc. Durgadas also has this prompt where he has you wrote a letter to yourself as if you were writing it to a dear friend who was in the same position you are; to have compassion for yourself. I have made some really great break through using that technique. I bitch when I journal, maybe I try to do some analysis or work through a journaling prompt related to it and then I write “my friend” a letter of compassion with maybe a hard truth or two mixed in. 

Tarot for Troubled Times(T3) focuses more on getting to know your shadow better and making friends with it. I think because of this book I’m starting to realize that my emotions are happening for a reason; my subconscious is trying to tell me that something isn’t right and I need to find what that is not to get rid of it, but to shine love and light into that area of myself that I have neglected for so long. We react the way that we do for a reason. To be fair, I’m not too far into T3 but right when I was thinking about wanting to try mediation. There was the chapter on it. 

Also, I carry crystals in my pocket and play with them a lot when I’m feeling like antsy and on the war path. I like the sounds that they make when I click them together but maybe some other type of fidget thing might be helpful? I also have realized that when my depression is bad I become extremely irritable and little things bother me more.  I try to spend more time doing gratitude journaling when this happens so I focus less on the negative and more on the positive even for a few minutes. 

Good luck OP!! Not being able to get out of your head is the worst. -_- I once got pissed at my boyfriend for using my roll of toilet paper while he was sick.

All your feelings are valid tho, and if that triggers you, well, it does. And given you have a normal friendship now, I guess you should tell her that's a boundary for you.

You seem content to talk to her everyday and all, just not the jokes about relationships? And the fact that you could ""see"" her getting into other relationships and ""possibly"" ruining it? I mean you said yourself she's been in therapy and you're able to have a friendship due to that. Maybe she won't ruin anything just...have another relationship (and that doesn't mean she'll replace you as a friend either) That's why I wonder if you maybe still have romantic feelings for her and that's why it triggers you so much?",Aureolindaisy,False,1679949593.0

123z3y4,"Yes I think I have some sort of feelings for her still. I don’t get into many relationships and I only do when someone is very significant to me.  She’s the only woman I ever wanted to spend my life with. And for the past 2 years I had to realize we were over and that wasn’t happening. Now, here she is.  

That’s not to say I have an agenda with her. I’m getting to know her again, and I just want authenticity. If that means she’s with someone else eventually, then so be it. I want whatever is authentic and real.  

But when we talk as much as we do, it’s difficult to not feel close. For instance, our day begins with her messaging me good morning. Then we talk all day, like sharing what we’re doing, laughing at things, and having a game going together on our phones.  I’d say we talk about 30 hours a week. So, given the way we vibe and connect, it’s not unusual that I’m beginning to become attached 

But the reality is we have a history and ya I guess I don’t want to sit here and learn about her New Romantic endeavors as much as I want to be a good friend, that’s hurtful.  And there’s no way I’d be able to continue talking to her this much if (a) she got into a new relationship or (b) I got into one.   

So I feel like I need to stop talking to her because I don’t want to get hurt.  But at the same time I’m not expecting anything.  If that makes sense. Both things are true at the same time. 

I’ve never felt the way for anyone as I did for her.  And the chance of seeing her again, someone I valued so much… on one hand sounds like something I want to do. But I feel I’m just opening myself up for hurt because if our connection is still there, which it is so far, it will likely cause me to have feelings for her after I meet her.  Then it will be me having to mourn and let her go again, when I already did that 2 years ago

I never forgot her. I had to learn to get used to life without her and it wasn’t easy. Why would I put myself through that again?  But then part of me feels like running away is the wrong thing to do as well.

Maybe those memes are either just memes or a ""what do you think"".  


So my advise, would be basically sitting down and talking to her. If you can in person, because body language helps. Running away will only lead to ""what if"" in your brain, given that you talk so intensely about her. What if it could've worked this time, what if she felt the same and I didn't do anything even tho we're both better now. And if you're considering runaway, then you shouldn't be afraid of the ""possible"" negative outcome right? And about ""going through that again"" will happen now either if she ends up in another relationship or you leave now. You're already sharing those hours of your life.

I now realize I was having an episode. I should know now the feelings of intense running is a signal to me not to trust my feelings in that moment or to engage with people.  I think posting here to reality check was a good safe call 

But you’re right, if I shut down and run away it’s the same outcome.  I’ve convinced myself it’s just a safer one.  But really, it’s the same.  And my therapist has told me I make up stories then run away from them and then spend my life down a rabbit hole of “what if,” and she tells me I need to face reality and accept it.  Maybe this is an opportunity for me to practice these new tools. 

As for my ex, no she doesn’t ask about my relationship status, I think she knows just by the fact we’re talking this much. She just tells me she’s single but we haven’t went more in-depth than that.   She’s told me she missed our connection, and mentioned a list of things, including my laugh and voice.  That didn’t seem completely platonic to me.  

I told her I miss all of those things about her too, because it’s true, but I guess it all just freaked me out because of what happened last time. 

But ya thank you for giving me a safe spot to share my feelings",minimalistdesign,True,1679964311.0
123z3y4,"You recognized it yourself, tho, I mean if you came in here for a reality check is just because you needed reassurance I bet. You just didn't want to do ""as always"" so you reached out and also now stopped yourself, you should be very proud of that!   


Help resources can be anything you need in the moment and I'm glad it helped!   


Doesn't exactly sound platonic to me, at least I know I'd be putting my hopes on those small things even if I tried to help it.   


Feel free to reach out if you need, I'll hope for a positive outcome of this!",Aureolindaisy,False,1679995008.0
