A good thing to understand is that thoughts and emotions are there to help you. Bad emotions want to teach you something, and to an extrapolated extent, emotions want to be welcomed as much as you may want to as well.  
They don't have to be right, you don't have to be right, but what you're feeling is real, and you won't stop feeling it by ignoring it.

You have to listen to what the other part says until it runs out of what to say, then you can tell it what you have to.  
This may sound very weird, but yes, you should talk to yourself, not in third person, but to yourself.

Be fair with how you feel and where you are. Don't lie, don't make the truth pretty, simply tell yourself the truth and ask yourself how you can make it right, or if you can make it right. If you can't make it right, feel the emotion, listen, and move on.

1cvtzem,"Hi, I'm 27F and I'm in the same boat as you with a few things. I don't always have many friends. I cut people off due to them always wanting something from me, I'll give like friends should. But when I need something too (usually some advice or something)  they're nowhere. At this point, I'm just being used....
I like the coworker idea from a previous reply, why not strike up a conversation with a coworker if possible? 
I have a messed up relationship with my family too, I feel like unconditional love does not exist either. It's a horrible feeling to say the least. 
Plastic surgery is a rabbit hole, if you get one, you just find another thing to obsess and be insecure about. I'm gonna go out of a limb and say if men want a woman who looks like a pornstar, that says more about him than any woman... That's very shallow, and you really shouldn't want a shallow man, that just further feeds into the love is conditional idea. ( We feel that, but can we act like unconditional love is out there 😭) 
I'm sorry about you being assaulted, that's rough. I'm also not comfortable in my femininity due to being called fat body shamed by my (fat) mom and grandma. Just take the trauma and double it, ya know.

So I just kept fighting for my mom and I still am but now sometimes I fight for me. Some days are real bad and others are just okay. The main thing is that we try, and we are gentle with ourselves and give ourselves props for getting out of bed or taking a shower. Celebrate the small things.

And huge reason to stay is because we don't know what could happen. Sure, your current feelings and beliefs tell you it's more of the same shit, different day. Find 3 things, no matter how small, that you're grateful for. Because you're not alone in your pain. You are having a common painful human experience and sometimes the struggle is beyond words.  You've gotta be at least a little open and not entirely pessimistic because it's gonna take work, just like anything.

Art & Journaling helps me a lot in the moment to get shit out, deep breathing -- there's something called the double sigh that physiologically calms stress, DBT helps a lot of PTSD, BPD and OCD type issues and symptoms-- there are countless beginner videos on YouTube. I highly recommend checking that out.

If we want to have a life that is worth living, a life that expresses our deepest feelings and emotions and cares and dreams, we have to fight.
 

5 ways to see Hope in the Darkness

1. **Connections and Relationships**: Building and nurturing relationships with friends, family, and loved ones can bring immense joy, support, and a sense of belonging.  If this part of your life feels empty right now, there is always a way to reach out and find your tribe.  Figure out what excites you and follow that excitement and it will lead you to people that are excited about the same thing.

2. **Personal Growth and Accomplishments**: Every day presents an opportunity for personal growth, learning, and achieving goals, which can be incredibly fulfilling and rewarding. It can be hard to want to be the best version of yourself when you're feeling the worst. Think about what might fulfill you, bring you happiness. Completely clear your head and write down your dream life exactly what you want exactly how you want it. We have no problem spending copious amounts of time being negative why not spend just a little bit of time forcing ourselves to be positive.

3. **Experiencing Beauty and Joy**: Life is filled with moments of beauty and joy, from the wonders of nature to the arts, music, and simple pleasures like a delicious meal or a beautiful sunset. All of this that people may see in life is like them seeing color and it seems you're viewing it in black & white. When we are severely depressed, finding at least one thing to be grateful for a day is a good way to start small, It doesn't have to be anything grand, it can be the fact that you got out of bed today or that you took your garbage out.

4. **Making a Difference**: Each person has the potential to make a lasting, true positive impact on the world, whether through helping others, creating something meaningful, or contributing to a cause they care about.  The saying is true you never know what somebody is going through.  A small compliment or a smile to a stranger could really turn around their day or possibly their entire life. 

5. ** Possibilities**: The future holds endless possibilities. Challenges and hardships are often temporary but feel permanent, and there’s always the potential for new opportunities, experiences, and changes.  It's very difficult to see clearly when we are practically blinded with overwhelming feelings of doubt, cynicism and pain.  You will never truly know what could have been or what might have been for yourself or for someone else, unless you stick around and find out.

In “On the Vanity of Existence,” Schopenhauer argues that life’s futility:

is revealed in the whole form existence assumes: in the infiniteness of time and space contrasted with the finiteness of the individual in both; in the fleeting present as the sole form in which actuality exists; in the contingency and relativity of all things; in continual becoming without being; in continual desire without satisfaction; in the continual frustration of striving of which life consists. Time and that perishability of all things existing in time that time itself brings about is simply the form under which the will to live, which as thing in itself is imperishable, reveals to itself the vanity of its striving.

No matter how much I can pretend that it's gonna be alright, feed myself with some new motivation or inspiration or even how much my loved one says they still believe in me, this emptiness inside ends up engulfing everything. I know somehow I'll manage to break their trust and just keep giving excuses. I don't deserve these nice, supportive and hard working people around me.

1cvlr1c,"Hey — don’t know the exact laws in the UK but as someone trained in this kind of stuff I can speak to it a bit. Therapists are required to hospitalize you if you show an immediate threat of harm to self or others (for instance, a plan, or something like “I could really commit suicide tomorrow” etc.) 

If you want to talk to someone without the forced hospitalization, we usually tell people to talk in hypotheticals. For instance, asking your therapist, “what would you say to someone who was thinking about XYZ or experience ABC?” Therapists know this trick and especially if you ask them directly “What will get me hospitalized?” They are used to that question and will inform you of what their exact rules are. I would really recommend you talk with someone, ask them what will get you hospitalized, and then work in hypotheticals. It works very well and I’ve never seen someone get hospitalized because of this.

On a personal level, I really think you should talk with someone. If not a therapist, there are dozens of online hotlines etc. for people like you. If even that’s too much, I’m here for you too in the ways I can be. Please feel free to reach out. Everyone on here cares about you and is rooting for you. Good luck, man.

Many people think even speaking this way is some kind of hate crime. The system in place to protect young or old from abuse is a joke, you can’t turn to an authority and talk about this because the culture of abuse is protected.. it’s religion or tradition rather than simply abusive.

My immune system is hyper active so it is just attacking my own body, in my case mainly my spine, but also attacking other parts as well. As a result my spine is getting infused and that's where the pain comes, my whole bone structure is just slowly getting infused and stiff. Some of the symptoms of this condition is a whole another condition itself, for example sometimes my immune system attacks my own eyes, which is called Uveitis, it can literally cause blindness in 30 mins unless proper drops are given in time. 

Among all of my misfortunes, this one hit me the most. I was once a very outgoing loving guy, used to hike a lot, now I cannot walk very long without getting a terrible fatigue, because along with my spine it's attacking my internal organs like heart and lungs.

I know it’s hard but try your best to live in the present moment or focus on a future event you’re excited about. That’s what got me through each day back then. Try your best to avoid mirrors and cameras and don’t put so much pressure on your physical appearance. Try not to focus on it too much and it will help a lot. What truly matters is who you are inside so instead of focusing on what you look like on the outside it’s best to try to discover and mold who you are on the inside. I also didn’t like my home life so I would be out of the house and away from certain family members for as long as possible. If you can, take long walks, car rides, bike rides, anything to get you away from home for as long as you need. I would do all of this alone because I had no friends to go out with. It helped me take time to reflect on my life as well and I loved to go out into nature and just enjoy being surrounded by it. If I was having a really tough time I would just sit in nature and breath, thinking about how gorgeous all the plants are and how wonderful they smell. Thinking about what a beautiful miracle it is that I’m blessed with being able to sense these things and enjoy them. I would let all my cares flow away and only focus on the beauty and calm around me. It helped tremendously and honestly nature is one of the biggest things that has helped to keep me from making that one decision you can’t come back from. You can also try writing things down in any form you wish, making art, music, something that helps you get your feelings, thoughts and emotions out through a healthy means. It’s okay to be alone as well, maybe through these actions you will find comfort in being alone with yourself. I do personally get bored if I’m alone for too long but for the most part I enjoy being alone with myself because I have put the work in to love myself and spend time with myself. It takes a lot of hard work and a long time but eventually you will as long as you put in the work.

I ended up only completing a year failing all but one class and barely passing that one.

Do NOT let others push you into doing what you don’t want to do, if you feel you’re not ready do not do it. Take your time and get set up and plan things out before you jump in. I don’t even want to be a psychologist anymore, I just want a decent job I enjoy enough and can make six figures in. Now I’m out however much money because of my failed year at college that was completely wasted. Imo college is mainly a scam to suck the money out of innocent young adult’s pockets. You have to get into a field with extremely high demand if you even want to have a chance at being in the career that you have a degree in. Most people who have degrees in one subject can’t find jobs in that subject and then they have to settle for retail or fast food or the like. Trust me, take time to figure out what you want to do and what’s the smartest decision. It is completely okay and natural to be unsure about what you want to do and the pressure is coming from people trying to manipulate you so that you end up failing because of the pressure, even if they mean well it doesn’t help when they can’t understand what I’ve discussed.

1cunma1,"Kicked out of school in 8th grade. Went to a new school to finish 8th grade. Was going to fail 9th grade. Became ""homeschooled"" and did 0 work until I turned 16 and dropped out. Got my learners permit to drive. Chilled for another 6 months as planned. Basically I had 2.5 years of 0 responsibilities and I did nothing.

Then I shifted my life into fast paced insanity mode! GED at 16, approved for college at 16, started college week I turned 17. I was refreshed and ready to make a change. Highest honors, graduated top of class, 3.98 GPA. I got 2 different degrees. I finished college, working full time, living in my own fully supporting myself at 20 years old. I worked my ass off at my job, upset a lot of people by changing and improving the way things were done. I worked multiple 24+ hour shifts. Demanded more work, more responsibility, more pay!

By about 23 years old I decided to finally make the change into my dream career (related to my work I was doing). Took a pay cut, moved to a place with over twice the cost of living. Struggled like crazy for about 3 years, working as hard as I could and proving myself. By 26 I was making pretty decent money.

My pay snowballed out of control, and my expected workload dropped off a cliff. By 27 I was making well over a six figure salary. I had so much free time, got work from home full time (pre COVID). I owned everything I ever wanted. I could do anything I wanted.

Meanwhile my friends from school got high, got drunk, partied, got fast food and grocery store jobs. They probably had a ton of fun for a few years, before they all ended up with kids and got divorced. They struggle to pay bills and feed their kids and it's really sad.

So my actual answer to why is life so fast paced:
TL;Dr - it doesn't necessarily have to be? You are at an age where life is about to hit you fast and you will struggle to keep your head above water. Accept it and fight through it and push through the struggles and odds are you will make it out soon enough. Or relax and take it slow and hope you make it through. But this is when you are in your prime of your life. If you want to get ahead in life, now is your chance. Make goals and make them happen.

1cun9oi,"Hey man, im sorry, but i don't think i have the perfect advice. I came here because i am in the same situation and i don't know how to change this. Atm. i work at a grocery store, and tbh. all i can tell you right now is this: Seek out hobbies, you can do alone and focus on work. If you're in school, focus on your grades and if you're at university just try to fucus on your subject. Loneliness like this can forcibly push people towards excellancy in their field. Me personally, i give it my best at work and i made myself invaluable for our store. I know im at the bottom of the food chain, and im aware im often being exploited, but i also am very aware, that if i were to fall sick, the store where i work would be in a little bit of trouble. I plan to study and do something else, but if i wanted to i'd probably be able to climb up the ranks very quickly.

So, in short do this... focus on making yourself invaluable in your field. Going on towards adulthood, popularity and so on becomes less relevant, unlike school life, where you just act on emotions and connecting with others happens on an emotional level, instead of a pragmatical one. Going towards your 30s, popularity at your workplace will happen (among other things) based on your aptitude and competence in your work field + ppl will come and go. And well, if you learn to also take responsibility and make people depend on you, you won't feel lonely, even when alone. It's very complicated to put into words, and im sorry you're in this position and i don't know how to change it, but you got this, okay?

She knew it was a big deal for me, she hated sleeping with someone but never told me that. I guess she decided that she would share a bed with me and sleep next to me, until it came time to actually do it and she basically refused.

Then she got mad that I was upset about it, that I cried too much, and some weird petty things that she never communicated to me that were issues with her OCD (like she wanted me to scrub the toilets, in our house that was new construction and finished 2 weeks before. She was mad that I just didn't do that for her without her asking...) I loaded the dishwasher for her because the sink was getting full. She apparently was testing me to see how long she had to wait for me to unload the dishwasher. The problem is I wash my dishes when I am done using them, she was washing her own dishes too and refusing to use the dishwasher, and I had no idea.

Then she stopped talking to me for 2 days, I was upset and admitted said something really stupid. She refused to lay down with me in bed, and I basically said well I wish someone would... Then she left without saying anything and was gone for 20 hours and wouldn't text me, tell me where she was at, answer any phone calls and I was so worried. I said if she didn't come home and talk to me I would want a divorce... So she came back and took me up on that and basically demanded a divorce even though I tried to explain I was just worried and wanted to know she was safe. 

OCD makes people have irrational fears, and I just kept triggering them and she refused to talk or explain the problem.

1cu2cc8,"Hey man, I get how you’re feeling. That’s where I get to as well, when I’m feeling bad. I think for me it comes from loneliness and then rapidly progresses to feeling that nobody would notice if I was gone. 

Luckily for me I’ve experienced this same cycle of depression/feeling exhausted miserable/lonely/not wanting to live a few times so I understand that these feelings come and they can be managed and then they go for a while. I don’t expect that I’ll ever be fully free from these feelings but most of the time I can reason with myself as I know these times will pass. 

For me the key is being able to talk to someone. I’ve not had the perfect run with therapists, I’ve had several duds that I don’t think helped at all. But I have had a good one and I think she taught me a lot. I’m now in a waiting list for a new therapist as I’m currently going through a massive doom spiral triggered by relationship issues/separation. It’s not easy to find the right one but I truly believe they can be the key to getting control over those feelings and getting your life back on track.

1cu2cc8,"Thank you for the response I appreciate it. Thinking about it those might be factors. 

I have had some physical issues which I’ve been trying to get a doctor for that hasn’t gone to smooth but long story short I have an on going back issue which has made me mostly bed bound. So I am very isolated. 

My psychologist I like him but I’m not sure he’s effective and his scheduling is a nightmare sometimes it’s the 2 week which I want because I can’t afford weekly and sometimes it’s 3-4 and when we talk it’s more like a friendly chat than any other session I have ever had. I had been thinking about keeping him reducing visits and getting a 2 psychologist that’s more effective. The reason I was thinking this is I really don’t have friends left bad marriage and divorce kinda killed all the connections I had so I was going to keep him on as kind of a paid friend. That’s really sad but it’s honest I guess.

the pet thing is so true, I have a great little guy but I think he’s nearing the end. He use to always want to be with me wanting to lay against my legs. But lately he doesn’t come up on the bed and just stays on the floor, that has been really hard for me because he’s been with me through so much shit he’s going to be 17 this year and the oldest a dog of his breed has ever lived is 21. 

I’m not interested in a romantic relationship but it be easier if I was tons of apps for that but none for making an a friend as an adult and it’s tough especially when it may never go beyond online. 

I have crippling social anxiety and agoraphobia the docs have disagreed about it because there have been instances where to accomplish something I had no choice but to leave the house, it’s a pretty big task though. Advance notice, planing every detail transportation, route. Doing what I can to identify parking options. Basically planning things to the smallest detail. And then I have to take a bunch of extra drugs my as needed drugs to accomplish it. After coming back I take a few days to a week to decompress and process it all. 

The one friend I do have left from the old days dosent understand mental health stuff in the slightest, which has lead to a lot of issues. A real “mind over matter” type that if I just try hard enough I’d be ok.

Also the illness and treatments have destroyed my memory so I have a lot of issues there like depersonalization and imposter syndrome ( not officially diagnosed ) not sure you can have both but sometimes I don’t feel real and sometimes I feel like I’m not as good as others think I am.

But thanks for the advice, I do think I will pursue getting a second psychologist maybe that will help. I really hope that you find the help to get through the relationship issue. That can be hard, I’m not too far out of my divorce and after that I had a brief reconnection with my first love and that went south.

1ctxpnp,"Sure. I don't mind. I suck at explaining things, though.

Just for some background information, my ""friends"" have been treating me poorly ever since I met them. They would make a lot of mean comments about the smallest things. I got judged for my eating disorder, they'd make fun of me for having autism, tell me I was going to hell for being lesbian, etc. I've tried talking to them about how I was feeling, but they all got mad at me for it.

Also, I've been through a lot throughout my life. Due to repeated trauma, I struggle with a lot of mental health problems. My main reason for wanting to commit suicide right now is because of all the shit I've dealt with in my life. Plus, a mixture of stress and losing everyone who I thought foolishly cared about me.

Everything started a few days ago when I reached out to them through text about how I was feeling suicidal. If one of us was struggling, we were all perfectly fine with listening and providing whatever support that person needed. One of them asked what happened. After I explained, I was ghosted. I'm used to that happening, even if I'm just trying to have a normal conversation. I've tried asking if maybe there's something that I've said or done that has made anyone uncomfortable. They just said no, and we all moved on.

At that point, I already had my suicide planned out, so the last thing to do was to write my suicide note. My friend found it and read it without my knowing. She reported it to my guidance counselor. I was kind of pissed off about it because that meant someone knew what my plan was. I wasn't going to be able to go through with it if I had people actively trying to stop me.

I lied to guidance and said that I was just venting in a journal, and my friend misinterpreted it. Somehow, I got away with it. I messaged her and told her to mind her business. I know I'm in the wrong for that, but at the moment I was panicking because this wasn't the first time I've had problems with suicide.

I mistakenly told my guidance counselor how I was feeling a few months prior to this. Long story short, I went to the emergency room and was assessed by a psychiatrist. I lied and said I was fine so that I could just go home and kill myself when my parents were asleep. I spent the rest of that day getting screamed at by my parents, and my mom started getting physical. At that point, I was too tired from crying, so I didn't go through with committing suicide. 

Back to the story: I got called down to guidance again because one of them showed them the messages I sent about feeling suicidal. I couldn't lie my way out of it, so I gave in. They tried calling my mom to get her to come pick me up. She didn't answer, so they moved on to my dad. He agreed, and I was taken home to be assessed by some crisis intervention program.

The entire ride home, I was being screamed at by my dad, and I was asking my friends why they were doing this. I got pissed off because they knew how my parents felt about my mental health. They knew I was going to be taken home and screamed at me for hours. I understand now that they wanted to help, but it just feels odd to me. Why do they only care now? Why did they ignore me after reaching out for help? Why was their solution to get me sent home knowing what my parents were going to do to me? It's so confusing.

But here we are now. My parents' jobs are being threatened. My mom might get fired because she kept declining my counselor's phone calls while she was supposed to be working. My dad might get fired for having to leave work early. I can't tell if my parents were just trying to get me to feel bad or if they were serious. It's hard to tell with them because they constantly lie to make me feel bad. But both of my parents hate me now. My friends are mad at me because, during our argument, I kind of called them out on some of the shit they've been doing to me over the past two years. I didn't handle the situation properly, but I'm glad I was able to get some stuff off my chest. I was always too afraid to be honest about how I felt. But now I have no friends. I tried messaging them, explaining what was going to happen, and they ghosted me.

1ctwpmd,"I’m so sorry that you don’t have anyone in your life who makes you feel like you’re loved. The truth is that being young sucks and school actively turns people into worse versions of themselves. You’re stuck in a bad environment you can only escape by getting older, and there’s nothing you can do to make that time pass faster. It feels like powerlessness, but even when you feel like you’re doing nothing, you’re actually exerting an immense amount of power just by continuing to live. And it’ll seem like you’re getting no reward for all the effort, but that’s only because the reward hasn’t arrived yet. Eventually you’ll get to start deciding how you live your life. You’ll get to end your education if you want, or get a degree or certification. You’ll get to move away to a new place with new people. And those decisions won’t always turn out the way you hope, and sometimes it’ll feel like you aren’t making progress, but that’s only because you’ve forgotten all the strides you’ve already made. 
Our brains are evolutionarily wired to focus on negatives, perceived or otherwise, because we won’t survive if we don’t feel the need to change poor situations. But our society isn’t built for young people to be able to fight against the negatives affecting them. So all you can do is weather the storm until you get older, and then you’ll automatically be in a stronger position to direct your life.

The best advice i've gotten related to this stuff is to try to take it one day at a time. Philosopher Alan Watts also opened my eyes to the fact there is always only the present. You won't ever have to live in the future and you shouldn't try to either. There is only today and this moment.


I often manage to take the joy out of everything by focusing on the future too much. I should try to remind myself more often that there's only the present. School and life can be scary but we shouldn't spend so much of our time worrying about the future and the stuff that will/might happen, because often things aren't as bad in the present.

It’s really just how each person feels about it based on their own knowledge, perception, experiences and journey in life. My perspective on it is  in most cases it often doesn’t seem to be the best choice, but in some cases it might be. The issues that are causing someone to feel suicidal can often change over time, even if they don’t always fully go away but they usually can and will change in some way, to make a permanent decision on something that will likely change in one way or another, doesn’t seem to be the best thing to do. Even if life does eventually become awful again after getting better and the same pain comes back again what if you have a few years in there that are really good and make holding on worthwhile, but you would never know that if you take your life. Also you could be facing the same pain years later but have a different perspective on it and just life in general and have learned to be able to live with it in better way, which then makes life worthwhile. Suicide also often leaves some extra pain behind and can make grief more complex for those left behind. If depression is a big factor in wanting to end things, in many cases depression does change and can get better over time. I think in circumstances where the pain is truly unbearable to that person and there is a very good chance that it will not get better, then I think it could make sense to consider that to be a decision that might be the best or right choice or whichever way you want to phrase that. That is really up to that individual what is unbearable to them and if they feel it is the best choice. I do feel in general it’s often important to try to exhaust all other options first before considering suicide to be the best choice, because I believe every life is incredibly precious and deserves to be fought for. I definitely believe there is instances where someone is in terrible suffering and it can be cruel to force them to stay alive.",rollercoasterdreams,False,1716414394.0

I'm a bit worried about saying the wrong thing, but please know my post was written with the best of intentions, apologies if it's not remotely helpful!


You sound like a kind, thoughtful, intelligent and good person. I'm so sorry to read about the racism you are having to deal with- it's not right. I was bullied in secondary school too, and it's so painful, but if you can, please hold on to the fact that when you are an adult people tend to be more accepting than when they are teenagers- I had no friends at secondary school but have friends now. I am sure there are many people you will cross paths with in your life who will be lucky enough to call themselves your friends. It sounds like the people at your high school are very small minded and don't deserve your friendship anyway.


I won't tell you that things get better with depression and so on- I've struggled with depression since I was 13 and am 30 now and still very much struggling, so it would be disingenuous to say that, but I've found that some areas of life that seem unbearable as a teenager do get better as an adult if you stick around. 16 is so young, please don't end your life now when there will be so much still to come.


Please talk to someone about how you are feeling- you shouldn't have to go through this alone. Are there any teachers you could talk to about your depression or about struggling at school? I think many people do care if you give them a chance to.




Your little brother is lucky to have you. I too only stay alive for others (I don't want to leave my dogs to an uncertain future), and know how painful it is when you feel you have to stay alive for others but you don't want to continue to suffer, but I am sure your little brother would be grateful if he knew that you are sticking around for him.


I really hope things get better for you- you deserve better. Killing yourself isn't the only option- you can continue to live, but I understand that sometimes it doesn't feel that way.


You aren't alone in your experiences and feelings, although I know how lonely it can feel.

If memory is bad, say ""so what, it happened, It was wrong but I accept it happened, it is not happening now. It is not all I am"".  
  
Do not wait for thoughts, fears or memories to find you unprepared.   
Hunt down your enemies.

Your mind is your world and you need to give it some attention, as you are only alfa and omega there, build in it whatever you need to build because no one else can.  
   
Multiple worlds, Eden or Hades. What ever you need.  
  
Build thoughts as unstoppable entities that haunt bad thoughts. Your own monsters who can work without your supervision.  
  
A great never ending desert where you cast your bad thoughts from which they can not return, and the next one that come will be thrown there too without a word. 

Or a nice place where your enemies can rehabilitate and heal but can not leave, far away from your inner world.

Make them entities in your mind so you can know who they are, this will give you clearer image of their personas.

It does not matter what you do, all you do in your head is good, just be absolute in your mind, all there is it is under you. And BUILD what is good for you.

Make every bad emotion, memory, thought as a entity and judge it on its persona and influence and designate place for it.

There's not too much context here, but living a world built for neurotypicals as a young autistic can be really anxiety-inducing. It can feel like a lot of unintuitive things are pushed onto us. Does he have friends online, or autistic friends? That can be really, really helpful in connecting him to the world in general.

Something that was really hard for us was having to go to school at a certain time and be forced in social interactions for 8 hours. Maybe your son feels like he's not in control of his life (which is extra hard for autistic people). This lack of control can bleed into various other issues regarding control. I know some autistic people who got to go to community college early and that helped immensely.

With all of these posts there is something in common. We are all lonely and just looking for support, to be heard, and for whatever we say to be just heard and for them to be okay hearing it and still be here. 
I was actively serving when I tried to take my life because of sexual assault. After leaving I lost my best friend (actually this month, may of last year.) 3 guys before him all my small clique from service… 
I want u to remember that there are teams of people like myself behind all of u who want what is truly best. Whatever that is for u. 
I am decently far into my medical degree for behavioral health… I want to be a doctor and it’s for reasons like all of u list. U feel so unheard and I don’t think the doctors are listening. It’s like they hear all the wrong things… not just for veterans for civilians too. I have seen this it’s a bit better in some states… but across the board we lack the number of real doctors who actually know what they are doing. I say this because I myself have a degree in mental health I’m a 100% disabled veteran for my PTSD. I have 4 rapes on my record with kits and suicide. I’m telling u, they do not hear us anymore than they hear u. I agree with you our system is a FAIL. A big one. If I could send a huge hug to all of u and let u know there are still those of us who care and want best for our patients. It devastates me at times to know I have to work for such a broken system… but I’m learning we can only control so much 😭 I wanna change the whole thing lmao uproot it from ground up but I just don’t have the power to. Maybe someday I will 😭❤️ I hope I do have this kind of power to make positive change for all of you. Just know ur not alone and if they won’t hear u.

I was (secretly) virgin at that time (age 24). My intention was solely that physical aspect, especially in order to loose my ""fear of men"" and the ""physical pain of first time letting in"".

The following has been so heart breaking, I can't explain.

He distanced and I respected, knowing my self-worth.
Difficult to understand but acceptable. However; came out a female neighbor (who invited me to the party after interviewing me about my type of guy and secret) had told him about my virginity and spread lies about me. He believed them. The whole game was so ridiculous, I blocked both. Btw. she slept with his whole friends group (her body her choice!)...

EVIL makes us wonder about a purpose in life.
I used to thrive! Without a goal!
Life used to be joy. Lighthearted. I was genuinly happy, despite poverty. I guess her envy won.

Now that my mind makes up several purposes all day, I wonder: How to undo what sadism has caused me?
A hole in my heart. Sadness without bottom.

I feel betrayed by sisterhood, by the universe, by my intuition and by him (for choosing a side, instead of owning his d*** and doing both).

1cxhjvv,"I am really sorry you're going through this and I want to tell you that you're not alone. I have had a very similar experience, and though I still sometimes find myself in a low point, there's a couple of things I've done that have really helped. I hope you find them useful <3

Assess your values and current priority. Not morally or socially, but what you value about your life. Try to identity what makes a situation enjoyable. For example, my priority is fealing at ease (it could also be smthg like feeling happy or having fun), because all the moments I enjoy have that in common and because it's the complete opposite to what I don't want. And in order to fulfill my priority some of the values I follow are purposefulness, family time and alone time. You just need to sit down and think about it. Writing makes it a lot easier. 

Once you've identified these, organize them according to what affects you the most and come up with ideas of things you can do or stop doing that'll help you steer your life towards the values that you identified. It can go from smthg as simple as coloring 5 minutes a day, to a bigger more challenging change like going to therapy. Just make sure you're going at your own pace.

Don't avoid your feelings OR thoughts. Not only because the can show you a LOT about yourself and what you value about life, but also because it's easier to deal with them as they come than all at once. Try to rationalize them, that'll give you clues about what needs to change in your life so that you want to live it. 

Finally, express yourself. Talking to someone can give you perspective, but I get that it may not always be a choice. Creative projects are great for this, just make sure you're not using them to distract or distance yourself from your thoughts and feelings.

I hope this helps you the way it did me :)

Soon enough you’ll be 20, and even then if you decide you don’t want to live the textbook wife and kids type of life you’ll be old enough to realize that isn’t the only option. Life comes in many diverse forms. The hormonal teenage dread will pass, you’ll feel like a fog has lifted and suddenly the world will sort of just settle and feel normal.

Not making it a competition just trying to make you see some perspective. People recover from that, then you can from movies and video games. 

You'll be fine. Just balance it out with some outdoor activities and non gaming hobbies.

Everyone is a ""dopamine addict"" to some level. Who isn't addicted to happiness and miserable when it's gone?

Just add some good habits into your routine and you'll see a change.

Learn an instrument. Read. Learn a language. You'll get a sense of satisfaction above pleasure from satisfaction with hardwork paying off.

1cwo2lo,"hi. You are not alone in this at all. I am also quite petite so I really get what you are saying and understand you as well. Sometmes it gets so overwhelming that I cant help but think how is it even my fault if I am like this. Its the combination of shitty genes from my father's side and also being quite malnourished since a kid because I was always depressed and developed an ED while also being a very picky eater. So I get that feeling about food, too. I used to think I would also grow up to be like all the women I used to see. But no one really prepares you for this. And you cant help but look at other women and compare yourself to them. Its just so frustrating and all these body issues and insecurities have made me hate myself so much that its just impossible to not think about it every other moment of your life. Its unbearable most of the times.

Still, I have no idea what to say to make you feel better about yourself. But I do know that when, even if rarely, I see someone who is petite like me or flat chested, I always end up thinking, ""hey, she looks pretty!"" etc. because they do. every woman (and this is coming from a queer woman) is beautiful and I cant help but worship the ground they walk on.

1cwo2lo,I’d smash a person similar to you. I’m Pretty sure you can just bulk up and hit legs. Also a lot of women musicians aren’t really attractive. If your song is catchy and you make similar songs to it then I’d dig it. Being more attractive does help because of the halo effect.

1cwo2lo,"If you think you're ugly. Sucks. Live with it. Gaslight yourself into liking yourself anyway or find/create other aspects of yourself that you care about. It's easy to wallow in some sticking point and either used that as an excuse not to improve or to call quits.
That said, kind of like people cringing when they hear recording of their own voice, it's pretty common to not also have a similar reaction to how you look. You get used to it and sometimes it takes a long long time. (Into my 20s for example)

Lift weights, do cardio, get stronger. Probably your stature makes it difficult to look intimidating, but confidence can help.

Taken a singing class with people of all shapes, sizes, looks, and ability. If you wanna do music, do music. No one's stopping you, but you. Same with art. Find a niche you want to get into that you like/enjoy yourself and start doing it and creating a portfolio and posting your work and advertising where people are looking for your kind of product. I've heard from many artist friends/acquaintances that they never feel like their work is good enough. That's for the customer to decide, and people that consume music or visual art do not have ears or eyes as well trained as the artists producing stuff.

""Didn't get the life/body I wanted"" vs ""didn't end up liking the life/body I got""

You can change your body through diet and exercise. Taking care of your body can change how you feel about it. 
Plastic surgery is an option. But honestly, as common as it is, I've never heard of someone voicing something like ""oh yeah, that person looks way better after plastic surgery."" It's usually either ""yeah, you can tell they got plastic surgery"" or ""why did they do that?""

There's a reason people sometimes say ""learn to love yourself."" It can be hard, and takes practice to love yourself sometimes. Especially if you're wasting time comparing yourself with others. It can be fucking hard to not compare oneself...we're built to compare things.

The city I'm in, rent and food is so expensive that the cutoff income isn't enough to live off of, and we were right on the line for SNAP so we got denied. I can't afford meds half the time and I'm waiting for insurance to decide if they will cover a wheelchair, and for now I had to spend all my savings on a chair I can use to get around so I don't die. My husband works hard but he can only make so much without destroying his own health, and I need him to be healthy because it would be horrible if he became disabled because he worked so hard to provide for us when I am unable to work. I would feel so guilty but there is nothing I can do. I'm constantly anxious about how we will afford more food and I'm so angry that the cutoff line for SNAP means that people making slightly more than another family will be forced to suffer, not have meds, not have food that is healthy or enough of it, just because someone arbitrarily drew a line in the sand and never updated it with inflation. We have had to go to food banks. We have had to go without meds and food, we have had to beg family to give us some food or help us afford gas. My husband works 70 hours a fucking week. He makes minimum wage in our area. It's so dumb that the government doesn't care to help by either raining minimum wage and putting caps on housing costs and food costs, or raising the cutoff for SNAP. We almost went homeless this month because our apartment decided to not renew our lease, and we couldn't find a wheelchair accessible apartment that we could actually afford. We found one but it is twice as much as the last one. I'm not sure how this next few months will go or how we will eat, I won't have money for all of my meds and I won't have money to even touch paying off my accumulating medical bills.

Reach out to a trusted adult, school counselor, or family member who can advocate on your behalf—having someone in your corner can make all the difference. Seek a second opinion from another medical professional; some doctors or clinics might offer free consultations or payment plans to make treatment more accessible. Explore financial assistance programs, grants, or charities that support individuals with medical needs—help is out there, and you deserve it. Talk to your school about your health issues; they may provide accommodations to help you manage your academics during this challenging time. If you're feeling overwhelmed, reach out to a mental health crisis hotline, Whichever one is from your country, which offers support for people in distress. Research local laws or consult with a legal aid organization to see if there are legal options for accessing necessary medical treatment without parental consent. Your health and well-being are paramount, and don't give up on seeking the help you need and deserve.

Some may only want top of the line attractiveness, but I would also argue that those people may make low quality partners. Most people are happy with imperfect people, they are imperfect themselves. I have found acne ridden people very attractive in my past, so I assure you it's not as big as you or your parents think it is. I know they mean well and want you to look and be as perfect as possible to reduce the chances someone leaves you, but I think chasing appearance is 1) unfulfilling and 2) possibly leads to people lusting and chasing after beauty instead of a human to human relationship based off of values, personalities, ect...

TLDR: sure you can increase the number of people attracted to your appearance by perfecting it, but it can open up to very shallow appearance seeking people and you should probably prioritize self-development, career, self-discovery, communication and make sure your personality is down to earth, you're fulfilled, know what you want from a partner and things like that",WoahGuyOnTheInternet,False,1716266060.0

1cwir65,"Hey dude. I just wanted to chime in and say that your post has resonated extremely strongly with me; I'm going through the exact same thing, almost to the letter. It's been very hard, as I imagine it's hard for you. In fact I would go as far as to say this is the hardest thing I have experienced in my life so far, and this may be the case for you also.

What I've tried to internalize is that life is full of these experiences, positive and negative. Before my break-up, most people I knew (and I don't know many!) had likewise experienced the dissolution of long-term relationships, somehow, I was under the assumption that what I had with my partner was going to be the statistical minority, the early adult relationship that sees well into old age. This was not the case, and it hurts. It hurts a lot.

Heartbreak and life being unfair is a universal experience, and when one is in the throes of the tumult, it can be very hard to see anything but the negative. I would be lying if I said this hasn't made me consider doing something stupid like self harm or suicide, but like you say in your post, I feel little courage to act on it. This, however, makes me believe that I can make it through.

Ultimately, if I haven't taken action to do something to myself yet, it is unlikely I will, and that means I will weather this; I think you will too. I don't know what comes next for me, nor for you, but it will be different, and with difference comes new horizons. You say you have a job, and that the job sucks (don't I know that feeling!), but this does allow you to splurge on yourself somewhat. Be kind to yourself, indulge a hobby, hell, try and find motivation for a new hobby if you have the means—if the job doesn't work out, you'll still be here to try something else. The negativity you and I both feel in this moment will inevitably pass into newfound freedom, this is just the ebb and flow of life.

There are always options. I hope you find your path, please try and be well, you owe it to yourself in this period of hurt and transition.",Covenic,False,1716221726.0
