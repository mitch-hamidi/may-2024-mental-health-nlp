truth is nobody wants to be friends with someone with severe depression.,1716146948.0,"I've been suicidal for over a decade. Ive probably been depressed my whole life.

What I want to say but never will. ,1716146854.0,"I am a 22 year old woman who will be entering her senior year of film school. I have been thinking of hurting myself for a very long time. I’ve just always been too afraid. My life has been full of pain, and I’ve done my best to try and overcome it, but it’s just too much. 

My childhood was full of abuse and neglect, which has given me BPD, anxiety, depression, and horrible abandonment issues. I have autism and ADHD, so I’m just a crazy emotional mess with horrible social skills and odd triggers that have to do with the textures of things that touch my skin and food. I’m kinda childish and really high energy when I’m in a good mood (or trying to act like I am), and it typically either makes people smile or annoys them. 

I have skills. I’m a great singer- had lots of training. I was a professional photographer for a while before I started film school, now I’m studying cinematography.  I’m great at it. I’m really good at drawing and writing. My greatest love in this life is music, but my family discouraged me from pursuing it, so I settled on filmmaking since I still enjoy it. I regret not learning how to read music at a young age so I could major in music. I practice by ear. 

I have a couple close friends. I’m not close with my family, but we are on good terms right now. My mom and I had a horrible and abusive relationship, which she has since apologized for and is trying to make up for by helping support me through college. I’m really grateful to her for that because without her, I would be homeless and living in my car. Everyone that really knows me tells me they love me. They all say I’m funny and I’m a sweetheart and they enjoy being around me. I try to be there for the people I love and validate them and just be good to them, especially if they’re good to me, but nothing I do seems to get people to truly care about me. It feels like they all just use me because they know I’ll do anything I can to keep people in my life. They take advantage of my kindness and keep me around for their amusement, kinda like a dog. But when I try to talk to them about how I’m feeling, how I wish one of them could just understand me and how I feel, how I wish I received the same emotional support that I give to others instead of only financial support or support regarding material things, it falls on deaf ears. I know they’re trying. I’m grateful to everyone who has helped me in any way thus far. But I have emotional needs too, and I don’t want to have to pay someone to care. I want the people I love to care. 

I’ve tried therapy for years. I’ve been in and out of mental facilities. I’ve had psychiatric help. I played along, answered their questions, followed the advice. Nothing works. At the end of the day, all I’ve ever wanted in this life is to be truly loved the way I love others- completely and unconditionally. It’s not about what they do for me. I love them all for who they are, and I would do anything for these people. So why don’t they feel the same about me? Why am I not good enough?

 No matter what I do, no matter what I say, no matter how hard I try, I’m never good enough. And no therapy will fix that. I’m just “too much” for people. I’m the person who fades into the background and is only kept around so long as it’s convenient. I’ve lost a lot of friends because I followed my therapists advice and stopped giving myself to people who only wanted to take from me. 

I did everything right. I got help, I took it seriously and did what I was supposed to do. I treat people the way I want to be treated, I communicate my needs, I respect people’s space and boundaries, I validate them, I do my best to be good and to follow all the advice that the mental health professionals have given me over the years. I spent time focusing on myself and bettering myself. But life remains the same. Nothing is fulfilling because I’m still sitting here with a massive hole in my heart. 

Objectively, I know I’m a good person and I don’t deserve to die. I know I provide at least a little bit of value. I love making others happy. I love when others’ interactions with me are positive. I like being like. I just don’t understand why I’m never enough for someone to care, to appreciate me, to listen to me and take me seriously? Forgive me if this sounds dramatic. I’ve been told my entire life that I’m just dramatic and my problems aren’t that bad. 

Why am I not important to anyone? And why should I stick around if I’m just damaged goods and truly don’t matter? 

I’ve heard “keep going” for so long. But why? Why do you want me alive just to treat me like I don’t matter? I feel so alone. 

I’m planning on just quietly disappearing. I’m taking one last trip to the beach with my mom, she’ll be the last one I see. Taking lots of pictures for memories. I wrote her a handwritten thank you letter for Mother’s Day to show her how much I appreciate her help so she’ll have my handwriting. I left one of my favorite jackets in her car so she has my scent, along with my favorite perfume. I’ll drink myself to death and die quietly in my bed. Nobody ever checks on me, so there’s no chance I’ll be interrupted and for once, that’s the way I want it. I’m sure nobody will even find me until my body starts to stink. I just needed to get this off my chest. These are my pure, unfiltered thoughts. I can’t tell anyone in my life these things. 



Thank you all for listening. Goodbye. ",martyrbabyyt,,False,1cvw5zk,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cvw5zk/what_i_want_to_say_but_never_will/

It’s so fucked that people still love me despite everything.

I can hardly take care of myself at 20 and my mother picks up all the slack and she feels it. She hates it. She tells me as much and knows how selfish I am. 

But they still love me, and still say that they couldn’t live if I was gone and I believe them. How do I show them the irredeemable truth of who I am so that they abandon me to finally do it without regrets? I can’t leave those people to suffer by dying but I want them to find peace without me. I fantasize every day about saying awful things, burning all my bridges so that no one comes to my funeral and I can rot in guiltless peace. But that’s impossible. What it’d take to get *everyone* to stop loving or caring for me would be its own insurmountable guilt on me until I died. I have no way out.

help ,1716145492.0,"i am about 200ish lbs 5’10 (ig it matters for the amount you consume) and im also extremely highly tolerant to basically anything my body consumes (drugs,alcohol,medication,even sedation from surgeries) i’ve attempted several times in my life, when i was younger (pre teen, teen) id usually try to take as many pills id find around the house. now i’m 26 and i’ve been prescribed xanax but stopped taking them months ago and have been picking them up monthly from the pharmacy to save up for another attempt and hopefully my last one. my biggest fear is it not working again. i’ve never received any kind of medical treatment after any of my attempts mainly due to no one really noticing me being gone and i will never call 911 on myself. im extremely worried that if this attempt doesn’t work again, that all my current medical issues will just be heightened if not i coukd add more internal damage to myself and once again have to find another way to die.  so i need this to work. i have 248mg of xanax, during previous attempts i’d usually drink alcohol with whatever pills but obviously it never worked. the last time i used xanax i didn’t have the amount i have now and it took them all with alcohol, ended up getting loopy and lots of sleeping and throwing up afterwards. i hate drinking in general so honestly idk if i need it or it’ll just work if i crush them all up and just toss it all in a cup of juice and chug it. idk if just xanax alone is enough to work. im running out of options.

i wish suicide wasn’t a sin :(,1716144938.0,"the only thing keeping me alive right now, is fear (fear of failing and fear of god) no matter how much progress i think i’m making, or what changes around me, i still would prefer to be dead. i hate my face, my body, my voice, my personality, the way i think and feel… literally everything about myself. that, and i’m just so fucking tired. i’ve tried so many pills and different therapists/psychiatrists that i have officially lost count. i’m so exhausted and i just want it to be over. i’m deteriorating both mentally and physically. i have also tried being more social, picking up new hobbies, etc. etc. i have supportive friends and family, too. but honestly, when i hear about others ending their lives the strongest emotion i feel in reaction is jealousy. i wish i had the courage to go through with killing myself. my plan is to set a date, possibly my birthday, which i refuse to continue suffering after. the longer i’m alive, the more i wish i would have committed to going through with it sooner. part of me wants to cry in this moment, but that never really helps anyway. it just makes my nose stuffy and runny. the only things that make me feel better at this point are drugs. i really hope i “accidentally” OD next time 🥲 to add to it, i have lots of illnesses, especially mental. my BPD makes me feel euphoric one hour, and unbearably miserable the next. i hate being given hope just to have it taken away again before the day even ends.  i much rather would have nothing at all. i feel so horrible for wasting a life blessed to me by god, yet at the same time i feel as if i’m being punished by staying alive. i pray he forgives me in the future ",cinnamonwaif,,False,1cvvfya,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cvvfya/i_wish_suicide_wasnt_a_sin/

29 just counting the days despite having worked for years to repair my life,1716142549.0,"Wrote up another last note im planning to leave soon.
Like many others I suffered through traumatic things, endured swxual and physical abuse that somehow I still blame myself for (despite logically knowing I shouldnt), maybe in a twisted effort to give myself power. All I ever tried chasing was genuine connection with people but as I unfortunately couldn't properly socialise in my formative years I was always far away from what I saw as normal or ideal. Rapes  harassment and other shit followed, only relationship i had was abusive and violent. 
Somehow managed ar least to get a career going and im just struggling around trying to fix myself and my life. It's always been extremely difficult to make friends or date normal people (seems hardly anyone likes me enough to date me) just burdened by loneliness. I've worked so hard to have a stable life, build routines, take care of myself and i do see changes, even people speak so much more differently about me and see me differently  but none of it warms my heart.
 Seems I can't run away from that classic past of dysfunctional family, negligent father, affected mother, childhood depression bla bla. Worked so hard even going to therapy for so long, all I do is just count the days until that day. I just feel extremely tired I don't even have wishes or visions of my future, I know I can't fulfill my dreams and passions, I know I'll have to stay alone for a long time or even forever.

When dad dies I’m going to kill myself,1716141962.0,"Why are my parents still taking care of me? I’m a bad prognosis, and even if this hurts, it’s something that can’t be changed. What makes parents love or at least like their children? 

Why do they like me? I’m just scared all of the time about everything bad that exists in the world, and in people and in myself. I won’t have a job, I don’t know if I’ll be strong enough to do something with my life, but they still here, giving me food, a home, medicine, therapy… taking me to places that may help me feel better and happy.

There’s nothing forcing them to look after me. So why do all of this? I’ll probably live with them all my life, I’ll probably still be like a kid who just doesn’t need to go to school. I’ll won’t be successful like my brother. 

I genuinely wish that what I did worked, but I’m still here breathing. I don’t have energy to try to do it again. I also think I don’t want to hurt my parents right now.

Not like I’ve been told my entire life to go to the ER when I’m suicidal and that the ward is there to help me. Stupid me for expecting the healthcare system to actually help me or thinking that I’m deserving of compassion or mental stability. 

I’ve been met with nothing but hostility and contempt begging for help while I had my entire life ripped away from me.

While I lost friends and family and everything I owned because no one believed I was actually trying to get help.

While I was stripped of every ounce of dignity and humanity begging for someone to take me seriously. 

Stupid me for thinking that the healthcare system was actually there to help me.

I can’t really write my own prescriptions or I would be. I kinda need a doctor for that.

Can’t really help myself there when every single doctor I talked to told me to go fuck myself.

The closest I can come to “taking control” is self medicating with booze, alcohol, and hard drugs. 

They refuse to listen to me, take me seriously, or medicate me properly, then treat me like worse than Hitler for resorting to self medicating in times of desperation, despite them making it clear that they have no intentions of helping me and that I’m not worth lifting a finger for.

I gave them dozens of chances to help me, and every time I got told to go fuck myself, so they don’t get to chastise me for my actions in times of crisis and despair.

My mental and physical health are both spiralling out of control, and I can’t find a doctor to believe a single thing that comes out of my mouth.

I’m done humiliating myself. I’m done expecting anyone to care. Cause they made it clear they dont.

So all I’m left with is self medicating and praying that my next hit is the one that makes me OD and drop dead.

I don't know what to do anymore.,1716139920.0,"It's hard for me to start this post, but I think first I should mention what motivated me to share this in the first place.

Next week I will turn 24 years old, and I still haven't achieved anything worth mentioning in my life. 
I hardly finished high school, I couldn't make progress in any degree to get a title, I have been dealing with depression since 2018, I never had any true friends in real life, some people betrayed me in traumatic ways, my family don't believe in any of my projects (my father even mocked me to feel better about his purposless life), I can't stand official institutions when it comes to education and learning (because they make me get burned out very easily). 
Also I have ASD (officially diagnosed Autistic Spectrum Disorder) and that made me suffer in many different ways. I have always been an outcast who suffered psychological bullying (and physical to some extent). I have never really understood society and that's probably the main reason why I never had a girlfriend (I didn't even have sex or kissed a girl in my whole life). And all this makes me extremely bitter, it is the origin of my sexual frustration.

Furthermore I have always had poor health. The past 9 months or so have been awful. I suffered a bunch of infections, fatigue from antibiotics, finger injuries (I'm studying piano), food poisoning, insomnia, long lasting shoulder injury, back pain, acid reflux, panic attacks from cannabis and fluoxetine use, etc. I could even talk about my experience with psychologists and psichiatrisys. How I had 5 different useless psychologists (one of them blaming me for sexual harassement I suffered) and how over the years all the psychiatrist I had prescribed a total of 7 fucking different antidepressants, alongside benzos, olanzapine and lamotrigine. 

Idk, it's such a massive pile of shit. I could have written way more, like my alcohol problems, but this is already too long.

I have had serious suicidal thoughts since around 2021. Each year it gets harder to control myself and avoid selfdestructive thoughts and actions (I avoid high places or getting close to the metro for example). I have taken drug overdoses a few times already and it's uncertain what day it will be fatal.

Right now I'm studying the piano degree, but I'm so extremely burned out from it that it is starting to make me hate music. And music is my life.

I used to want to be a scientist or mathematician, but I got so burned out I couldn't bear hear anything about it for 4 years, I hated it. But anyways I'm not good enough for it.

My dream would be to be a composer and create profound pieces of music that expand our human experience. I want to revive the world of classical music and inspire others. Also I would like to make ALL my content public, I hate to give a price to my content or make it unaccessible to people who might enjoy it.
But well, all of us need money to live, so I guess I'm fucked. I can't earn a living from being a composer.

I know this post is a pitiful autistic rant, but I simply needed to shout at the void and rant about most of the thoughts that haunt me every single day.

Oh, and by the way, I did try to have a better mindset and work hard during months. I applied stoic values to my life, worked out, stayed disciplined, I saw the positive in everything that happened to me, I had humour, etc.
But I just can't do it, I feel fucking empty and nothing seems to work in the end.

Now I'm just thinking about if it is worth to keep trying. And if not just plan my last months of life before I end it all.

Its only in my head but its a clear voice in my head, I cant tell if im imagining it or not. I have a male voice that does the same  It didnt used to be male but its become clear in the past week or two.

 I used to tape over cameras and stuff because i thought i was being watched, i also used to think my arm wasnt mine when i was 16(im 20 now) and cut and burnt it because i could barely feel anything.  Im certain something is wrong with my head, i might be schizophrenic but i dont know. thats why im so confused, i feel like thinking that in itself makes it less likely but i dont know what else it could be. My friends think this i mean, i dont think this. or at least im 50/50. I think i just deal with stress poorly and thats why this happens, i just imagine the voies and stress makes my speech jumbled. 

Ive tried to get help through local mental hhealth services and psychosis teams, and my doctorsbut but got discharged from all of them. Theyre trying to fuck me over i can tell unless im just a liar. My grades have gone from Cs and Bs ish to F's in the past few months my friends and family are worried. the voices are getting more frequent and clearer.

Hes doing the same thing i used to do, now hes started doing coke though while i only drank and smoke before i turned 18 where my fdrug habit got bad. 

im 21 now, clean off most things but my hhead is worse than its ever been, i finally found something i wanted to do as a career and im having to watch my grades drop while i do the exact questions i did last year and i cant answer thhem anymore.

Loneliness is an inherent part of the human condition,1716128868.0,"Most people will encounter the feeling of loneliness and probably even hopelessness once in their life.

This has already huge implications. The essence of what I want to say is that we try to connect with others and share our authentic selves, but society has too many taboo topics, which (depending on how long you live/ what experiences you made) will make it or already makes it impossible to properly connect with others.

Of course there will still be interactions. But it will be shallow and will leave you realising that you can't get it from other people.

I'm tired of having to think that I have depression, which means that there is something wrong with the way I think. I'm not the problem, it's that society ultimately makes us depressed. Rampant consumerism, the mistreatment of the ""weak"" (the poor, LGBT+ people, the mentally ill, racism, misogyny, patriarchy, the list is endless). Even when individuals would deny any discrimination, our systems do. If you can't take care of yourself, how are you going to do taxes and make a living? Even when you get money from the state, is simply isn't the same as someone who is lucky enough to work a well-paying job. Society rewards people all the more who are useful and I see that as inherently evil.

Utopia would be a place without Social Darwinism of this form. But this is a fantasy. Utopia is defined as a place that's not real. Giving up on utopia, a characteristic that is associated with depression, is ultimately the best thing to do. Humanity has destroyed itself the most when it tried to achieve unrealistic ideals.

To come back to loneliness. It is a symptom. A symptom of a sick society. It's a reflection of how wrong our society is and always was. Technology and medicine, which make us live longer, all this just makes us realise how insane the idea of ""just being happy"" is.

I reject happiness as a concept. Happiness is a static state. There were never revolutions by people that are happy. Nothing changes when people that are happy. Happiness is functionally speaking a state of conformism. No one should ever strive to be happy. I see it as morally wrong.

This is the end of my silent revolution that this post attempts to symbolise. A revolution which leads to nowhere and ends up suffocating before it leads somewhere. This revolution is a reflection of human existence as a whole.

I don't want anything. There's nothing out there for me. It's not even a case of I can't get what I want, I just don't want it. Money, fame, power... I could have it all.

I don't know what they want from me dude, I've tried so hard for everything, I genuinely can't take it anymore, I feel like I'm gonna snap or break or smth. I don't wanna treat ppl badly but everybody has atp pushed me to my edge. I try so hard and for what? For nothing. I've been nice all my life and got nothing out of it, I don't get what's the point of being nice anymore when I don't get anything good out of it. Ppl only treat me worse and worse. But every single person who has been an asshole to me gets treated so nicely and everybody likes them. But God forbid I lie fucking ONCE and than you have someone calling me a two-faced bitch and than I lose a friend over it. Why dude why, so many of them are worse than me but nobody cares about what they've done to me but if I ever say smth rude to them I have like 1 or 2 ppl upset at me over it. I hate them all so much.

Truthfully I could go on and on about it and stuff but yk 

Everything has led me back to square 1 which is wanting to kill myself. These past 2 months have made me probably the most suicidal I've been in a long time, if ever honestly. As everyday passes I wanna just take a knife to my throat and end it all since everybody would probably be better on without me. I make no difference for them so why should I even be alive? What's the point of being Alive if I probably make nobody happy. I'm just a stupid waste of space. I plan on committing in maybe a month or so, idrk yet but I hope by than things have gotten better since I really don't wanna kms man.

today is THE day,1716127982.0,"Shadows cry as dawn rises
A mournful dance as night begins to die
I stand alone beneath a tired, weary sky
Ready for death, but not for goodbye

Life is so fragile - unraveled and torn
Moments of joy quickly covered by forlorn
The end approaches - joyful, ghostly sigh
Ready for death, but not for goodbye

Echoes of laughter haunt an empty hall
Heavy whispers in the darkness call
In every heartbeat, memories come and lie
Ready for death, but not for goodbye

Eyes growing heavy, my days are black as night
Embracing the void, surrendering the fight
And in this stillness, my broken soul cries
Ready for death, but not for goodbye

Darkness deepens and hope frays
Dreams once bright now a ghostly gray
With every step a past I must defy
Ready for death, but not for goodbye

In silence where sorrows whispers blend
I face the darkness, my reluctant friend
Though weary heart longs for the final sigh
Ready for death, but not for goodbye

Yearning for peace but fearing goodbye
Ready for death, but not for goodbye
Ready for death, time for goodbye

I want it to end.

I wish I didn't have friends so I could kill myself,1716127410.0,"I'm just so tired of living for the well-being of other people instead of my own. It's my life, I wish I could decide whether or not to keep going based on my feelings and not based on the guilt I would feel at hurting my loved ones. I'm not happy, my life is trending downward in every respect. I don't even think I'll be able to keep these friendships long-term anyway because I'll become too much of a failure and bring everyone down around me, but in the meantime, these people care about me and I don't want to fuck up their life. I know what it's like to lose a friend (not to suicide though) and it's devastating, the grief shattered me for years. I don't want them to experience that. Sometimes I want to sabotage my friendships solely so they can end and I can be free to kill myself without guilt, but I know the process of sabotaging my relationships would also be hurtful to them. 

I'm stuck in this depression-fueled arrested development anyway, watching as everyone gets their life together, finds love, starts their careers, and moves away while I'm just totally stuck in place. I guess it's mostly my fault for not ever really opening up to them, but I don't even feel truly known or seen or understood by my friends. I feel like I'm just playing the character of a good friend for them, and I've done too good a job. I'm loyal, dependable, down to go anywhere, help defuse conflicts, always able to offer them a helping hand or emotional support. I don't want to take that away from them because it can feel so good to have someone always in your corner. I feel like I fucked things up so badly now that killing myself will hurt too many people, but I just don't feel like a real person. 

I genuinely don't want to continue on with my life. I'm terrified of dying in an accident, or becoming sick, but I want this existence to end. I don't see a future for myself where I am happy. I feel like an observer in the world, I watch and I try to play the part of a good human being but I don't feel happy. I don't enjoy things, I haven't in such a long time. I hate myself so deeply I don't think I will ever be able to have a good life for myself. I can help others feel good about their lives but I don't think I will ever truly be happy with my own. I guess now I'm just waiting for my lack of ambition and drive in life to catch up to me, for me to go broke, and have everyone finally, finally leave so I can get it over with. I stopped dating people, I haven't dated anyone in almost five years and it's been lonely but it's been pretty easy to cut that aspect out of my life. My relationship with my immediate family isn't great, so I honestly wouldn't feel too guilty about what my suicide would mean to them, even though that is probably callous to say. I just wish the friendships were easier to cut out. I really do love my friends though and that's the problem, I can't hurt them like that.

Lost and Scared,1716127184.0,"Yesterday my girlfriend of one year broke up with me. I had always believed she was the one. 

When she broke up with me it was in a very demeaning and hurtful way. She downloaded hinge and showed me the guys she was talking to and the ones she wanted to fuck. There had been a lot of emotional and physical abuse directed toward me in the relationship, but I still thought she was the one. Despite all the bad things, she was the best partner I ever had. 

Additionally, she filed for a restraining order against me with baseless allegations that most likely will ruin my career. 

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. Nearly all my relationships have ended with my partners telling me that they don’t like me as much anymore or that there are other people who are better. 

The only options I have are to get back on dating apps which means I will never find another person like her. 

That is also aside from loosing my career. It seems like this is the end of the road for me. Looking at my future it doesn’t seem bright or one I want to participate in.

I (f30) am unsure how to protect my boyfriend (m39) from my mental health issues. ,1716126125.0,"*trigger warning self harm* Ive been with my current partner for 2 years. We both fell really hard and fast for each other, and our relationship progressed quickly. I moved in with him after 5 months, and from the beginning, we had an internal knowing that we wanted to spend our lives together. 

After we moved in together, however, we went through an extremely rough period. We started fighting all of the time, and for about 9 months I was on edge because I was terrified to do or say the wrong thing. During this time, it seemed like I would offend him or upset him on a daily basis, and our fights would escalate to screaming matches that often involved me sleeping on the floor of our bathroom crying my eyes out. He’d often demand apologies for things I felt were small, and get really upset if I ever tried to explain behaviors or things that I did. I got in the habit of apologizing for EVERYTHING & blaming myself a lot & the apologies never seemed good enough for him. 

At the same time, I had a very traumatic upbringing with unstable parents, and don’t have a relationship with them as an adult. I was also in an abusive relationship a few years ago, and still have nightmares about my ex. My therapist says I have symptoms in line with cptsd. I have lots of friends, but getting close to others is extremely hard and scary for me. I’ve also had regular ups and downs in my mental health. 

During the rough period with my partner, I developed suicidal tendencies and started self-harming. I bounce between anger and guilt continually when I do something that hurts or upsets him, and I am terrified to talk about things that bother me because I’m afraid of arguments. My boyfriend also says that I have a distorted view on arguments, and experience our disagreements as a lot worse than they actually are. Things have improved immensely between us, but I’m still afraid to talk to him, the suicidal thoughts have ended but self harming persists.. I  am actively working on this with my therapist and life coach. I’m also looking into joining a DBT group. 

Fast forward to now and our arguments don’t get NEARLY as bad as they used to, but I’m still having self harm issues regularly because I get so scared to have tough conversations or when I upset him. At this point, we are able to recognize and stop when things escalate, but for some reason I still go between guilt and anger very quickly and end up hurting myself. I’ve broken my hand twice from hitting the wall, and I’ve bruised my face several times. He’s seen it happen and is very disturbed by it (rightfully so), but I can’t seem to stop. It’s like something snaps inside of me & I hurt myself.

I’m watching this take a serious toll on my partner, and I don’t know what to do about it. Part of me feels like I’m ruining his life and he would be better without me, and I live in constant guilt over it. Another part of me is hopeful things will get better, but at what cost to him and the relationship? I’m scared he will stop loving me, or that I’ll have these issues forever, or that I’m inherently broken. 

Can anyone relate or give some kind of advice on how to cope with this & proceed? 

TL;DR I developed self-harm issues after a rough time period with my boyfriend with lots of intense arguing. Our arguments have improved and gotten better, but the self-harm issues persist and deeply hurt my boyfriend. I don’t know what to do & would like advice on how to proceed.

How do I know how serious suicidal thoughts are?,1716116627.0,"I've been having suicidal thoughts since I was like 12. A lot of it is mostly just 'I don't deserve to live' kind of stuff, but I've also had pretty vivid dreams of people telling me I should kms and being happy when I attempted and didn't survive.

I have attempted twice, but I'd try neither methods again since they were so slow and (obviously) didn't work. So I don't think these thoughts are anything to worry about too much.

However, a lot of the time when I think about committing suicide, I think about doing it with a gun. It'd be extremely hard for me to get one here (UK), but if I did get my hands on one- which is possible- I'd definitely shoot myself with it. That's not even a maybe. I definitely would.

I want to get into hunting, but that would probably be dangerous for me because like I said, I'd shoot myself. Maybe not right away, but I eventually would. It's quick, and that's what I want. I want to just leave this world as quick as possible, and not have to deal with all this anymore, and for everyone else to stop having to put up with me.

But how serious is this? I mean, it's unlikely I'll get a gun anytime soon, and all other methods are out of the window*. If I tell a therapist about this, will I just be told to suck it up cause others have it worse than me?

I wish I could talk to a professional about this without getting the police called on me (happened last time, it was terrifying).

*I did recently get a whittling kit, and was heavily considering stabbing myself, but I thought about how hard it'd be (I don't want my family to see my dead body, so I'd have to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night with a knife without getting caught, only for there to be a pretty high chance it'll be unsuccessful) and ended up not going through with it.",oh-no-ok,,False,1cvlr1c,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cvlr1c/how_do_i_know_how_serious_suicidal_thoughts_are/

All comes falling down ,1716114571.0,"My partner and I are being forced to move out by August 1st. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we have very little time to find a new place. In the worst case scenario, my partner has a place to stay with family, but I currently have no options lined up. I had been working in a gig capacity due to some health issues, and this event has forced me to go into overdrive after being unemployed for about a 6 year gap.

While I don't want to dwell on the details, this situation has left me feeling desperate. Public transportation is limited in my area, and without a car (which I can't afford to insure), my options are further restricted.

My current plan is to aggressively apply for remote work positions. Ideally, the job would allow me to make enough to afford rent in NY within the next 90 days. However, I recognize this might be a challenge.

There's a potential safety net – a friend who recently moved to Texas is trying to sell his house in the San Antonio area. He might allow me to stay there temporarily while the house sells. The appeal is the walkable environment and decent public transportation. But there's a big fear: if I relocate, will I ever make it back to NY?

My partner can stay with family, so at least there's that.

Right now, I'm overwhelmed with fear and uncertainty. Every passing day feels like the pressure is building

All of this, and my partner told me she wants a separation so we can work on ourselves

I'm just so fucking tired of life.,1716107105.0,"I wanted to post something regarding my mental health so I made an anonymous account. I am a 15 year old male and honestly there really isn't anything that wrong with my life. Of course I every now and then get yelled at by my parents because I did something wrong, I have trouble dealing with homework, blah blah etc. The typical teenager stuff.

But I occasionally have these moments where I feel so fucking depressed and want to kill myself, not that I would ever do it because I'm genuinely afraid of what will happen after that so don't worry about that for now. I've had small moments of suicidal feelings throughout my teenage years but it's gotten worse as I go through highschool. My life definitely is not as hard as others and I don't do much difficult things in general, but I am so tired of homework, assignments, 4 hours of shitty tutoring every week, some may say I'm blessed, confused on what I'm complaining about since their life is so much worse. Maybe I am. However I'm just genuinely so incompetent in regards to putting in effort, so much procrastination for literally everything, even the things I find joy in. Because of this I get yelled at by my parents because I ""don't put enough effort in"", and when I get a good mark on something they do praise me, but they also go ""you could do better"".

I'm sure they think it doesn't matter that much and that I'm overreacting but it just genuinely makes me so angry because I actually fucking tried on it, only for them to give a small compliment. To be clear I love my parents and I'm sure they love me too. They aren't bad parents either it's just that the way they do it doesn't really mix well with me.

Their wishes for me is to get good grades and reports in highschool, get into a good university and get a good job. It makes sense and I'm not against that, it's just the process of getting there, and the fact that I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do with my life. There's nothing specific I want as a job and the very thought of me slaving away at some average company is something I absolutely don't want. I wish my family was rich or I could redo my life so I had a better chance of becoming something I and my parents would be proud of.

It's bad to do but I also don't want to say anything to anyone, besides maybe my cousin and her friend since they can relate. I probably should get therapy but that's literally saying ""my mental health is kinda shit"" which I don't want to do. I'll probably get therapy sessions of some sort after I get my own money and settle down independently, if that's even possible and if I haven't killed myself by then.",anonymous090202,,False,1cvjjqq,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cvjjqq/im_just_so_fucking_tired_of_life/

I took out loans to take these fucking classes and now I’m going to fail out of them and have some more debt and no degree to show for it. I hate my difficult, physically strenuous low paying career, and now I see no way out of it. I’ve been taking my meds like I’m supposed to (last time I wasn’t) and yet I’m still here.

I love my friends but whenever we all hang out I truly feel like my presence wouldn’t be missed so what’s the point. And whenever I try to express just how low I’m hitting, I’m not taken seriously. 

I’m also terrified of “being too much” and burdening and hurting my friends with something that isn’t their responsibility. 

My parents are of no help whatsoever with this because either they don’t take me seriously, they don’t talk about it, they minimise it or they end up spinning the conversation back unto them and their issues. 

I have a little brother that for reasons, I will have to take care of when my parents are older and/or have passed away. My sense of love and responsibility for him is the only thing keeping me here but lately it’s getting harder and harder to hold on.

i’ve been to therapy but they all say the same thing and give me new meds to just stay alive or else ill just sleep the whole day and lay in bed. i just don’t know how it’s even real to see someone who took everything from me get to start over with no repercussions while i suffer with everything he did. not to mention i have to walk around with features i have from him and the fact i’m related to him. no one seems to understand how disgusting and gross that is. to look similar to person that hurt you, to have their features, genes, etc.

May 26 is also my ex fiance/baby father's (had miscarriage, worsened PMDD) birthday. mine is June 1st. i should be 26, so bittersweet. i was got kicked out at 16 into my first program but also my workers put me in a residential program because everyone knew i was serious i was determined to not make it past 16. i feel almost exclusively all i've been thru more trauma, abuse, now me deteriorating health which could be improved if i just had somewhere safe to go. i have a state aided housing funding but can't even focus on finding help too often while she berates me and drains my energy and sends me into states of psychosis/passing out from denying me food or making my ED flare. 

i kept ending up in the ER and even went to an inpatient for a few days (not helpful, most are horrible and i speak from experience since i was 11 of being a ""revolving patient""). i keep ""disappearing"" they've nearly filed missing persons when i leave to entertain the thoughts even when people keep telling me to. i keep praying, fighting, trying to cope but i can't. all i want is to not deal with unending pain and abuse. i want more than anything to grieve safely but just for people to be PRESENT. people know, my psych knows i'll do the heavy lifting i just need people there. hearing no one's voice on end for weeks except the words from my mother, stonewalling, occasional interactions with a new friend, my mins is so overwhelmed it's hallucinating. including folks who care(d) for me in an effort to not feel alone and feel someone's there for me. having your brain hallucinate/the usual flashbacks but woven in with hearing ""i'm proud of you"" ""i love you"" ""i'm here with you"" knowing it's not real but it's just trying to keep you alive throughout the ordeal and dissociation. i know that's a lot, but i have no support or anyone to tell or be present with me i'm afraid. i'm trying not to join my mentor and all the people i love. but i'm exhausted. being dumped on, drained, isolated, and scared all the time is too much. i wake up in agony and fear if i can even sleep. i'm so lonely, tired, angry, and hurt. i can't find a reason to go on. all i wanted to do was maybe have a decent job, be loved, have true friends/maybe a relationship, be a mother, and heal & help others. but i can't see myself even surviving until tomorrow. each second is a struggle. i haven't relapsed in binge drinking, purging, or anything but self harm which mine is already severe and has scars. i was gonna get a tattoo started to cover them. 

i had plans, dreams, aspirations, but i can't see a way out of this and can't exist feeling so alone and hated. i don't even want to truly die after doing so so many times my whole including recently. but i feel there's no way out and keep being told to and that the world would be better without and forget about me. my PMDD and autoimmune is kicking my ass. sick of hearing how resilient i am, platitudes, empty promises or words while all i fucking want/need is someone to be here with me. i don't even wanna necessarily talk. i want joy, pleasure, softness, protection, company. i just need to be witnessed/received. i do it for so many people. hearing how i've saved people, been the only one there, a ""wonderful, loving force"" but then knowing most if i guess not all will use me then dip. that i'm perceived as a catalyst. valued for what i do, not who i am. that no one is interested in knowing, just the using and transaction. but also missing the people who made me feel safe, heard, and alive so much. wanting to reach out. but there is goodness in peopl. i just don't know what to say, if everyone truly hates me, where to find many people. i keep reminding myself people can't help if they don't know. but it's wild, everyone knows. i feel like a dying animal, isolating and preparing to pass as to not stress others or soften the blow i've had some amazing support. complete strangers showing me love and compassion. even my abusers in some capacity. but i'm too tired to scream. my nonverbal issues have been at an all time high. God. i just don't wanna go out like this. at all. i don't know who or how to scream for help. i can't fight alone anymore. i want to rest. one of the attorneys i work with, a new friend, and my HS staff being the only ones currently to make space and time and advocate/support/show up for me. seeing the fear in my eyes, the way they know i can disappear and what i've done to myself and has been done to me. there's truly 2-3 people i wanna see but i don't think they'd wanna. i miss my mentor, my other departed ones, my child i would've had, friends old and new, someone i prayed for/developed a crush on who was a literal angel, and my ex in a way. i would do anything to just see one of them one more time. i can't do this anymore. i can't even sort out or know who to call on or how i can keep going. i'm managing too much by myself while essentially on my death bed/deteriorating. any advice especially about reaching to folksor words of encouragement would mean the world.

To my relatives reading this I want you to know that the reasons I'm doing this have nothing to do with any of you or anyone in particular, I am very greatful for all the support I've received over the years, I'm just tired of existing, I'm tired of living, no matter what I do ever since the day I was born there's always some shit going on, whenever I think I'm going to have peace a new random shit happens, it's been like this ever since the day I was born and I've come to realize that it'll stay like this forever until I finally pass away in PEACE.

I've already been living for more than 30 years, it's enough, I'm tired I'm just done, I did everything I wanted, I have no regrets(not even the bad decisions), I apologize deeply for any pain/suffering or unexpected consequences my absence might cause but I do not wish to participate in this ""thing"" anymore. Thanks to all my family for all the support, I realliy appreciated it when I was alive, I love you all and please know that I went away happy that all of you always supported me through everything.

There is not amount of money, success, companionship or advice that can save me from the pain of existing, there is nowhere to run, there is not a brighter future and things will NOT get better ever, the only way things will get better is when it finally ends, thank you all

Ohh and I almost forgot, for all my relatives who read this, you might be wondering why none ever found out I was thinking about this, well there were ""hints"", but I never showed signs of ""depression"" because I was not depressed, people idealize in their head the image of someone who's going to do this as someone who's extremely sad and depressed and what some people don't realize is that some of us are just tired of everything, it's not that we're depressed or sad. My suffering doesn't come from sadness it's just the everyday struggle that I'm tired of.

Paracetamol overdose?,1716095498.0,"I'm 16 y/o and I've been living alone for some time now, since age 14 I've been having suicide attempts regularly, and pills started being the main option cause they were kinda smoother to hide and almost always got me to pass out and wake up the next day.
Thing is, this is my 12th time taking a big dose of paracetamol on a sit, I started with 4gm but now I took 18 pills and according to some sources on Google this is a mortal dose. I don't really know what to do, almost everytime I did this the pain was awful on the next morning but I keep relapsing on this everytime I have pills near me.

I went to the bridge today,1716095240.0,"I always have visions and thoughts of falling or flying through the air. It’s the feeling of freedom. But I never want to go splat.

I’ve had passive ideation for a few months now. And today I was so exhausted of this feeling of long-lasting underlying sadness that doesn’t go away. I was so happy in the morning. And in the afternoon I went for a walk, went to the cafe, went book shopping, went to a restaurant. I enjoyed it. But on the walk home in the park the feeling came back, the feeling that always keeps coming back, the feeling that won’t leave no matter what I do, the dull melancholy and exhaustion. 

I sat down at a bench facing the river. I thought it would calm me down or bring me a sense of peace like before. I just felt like crying instead. Whenever I get a chance to breathe, to think, to be, I just feel like crying. I’m so tired, so exhausted of it.

I stood at the bridge crossing the river. I had no plans of jumping at all really. I just wanted to feel that control, the feeling of being able to stare down death, to look down at the water, to know that my choices matter. I can still make choices. I have agency.

But the bridge is not high enough. I don’t feel fear looking down. I know I won’t die if I jump. I don’t get the satisfaction from looking down the barrel. It’s not enough. I’m disappointed. And there’s too many people around. I can’t even cry or lean too hard on the railing because it would make a show. Too much attention.

I don’t know what drove me to go to the bridge. It’s not like I was planning to jump. But something about being able to stare down death brings me comfort, for the railing to be the only thing separating you from life and death. It’s a calming feeling, to feel so close to death but without crossing the line. I fear death. But I need reprieve.

I’m worried that my passive suicidal ideation is developing into something more active. I still don’t plan or have concrete plans. But the fact that I went to the bridge, considered its height, the potential outcomes of jumping, it worries me.

I’m scared for myself. But it’s exciting knowing there’s something out there that can calm me again. But I know it’s dangerous. It’s so sickening.",Mental_Good_8832,,False,1cvglw2,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cvglw2/i_went_to_the_bridge_today/

I hate this about me. I'm always the one picking others up and dragging them.

I dance. I make jokes. I have fun. I'm usually told I'm the bright spark, the one creating a conducive environment.

It's all a front. And while the front can protect you, it can't save you. I tried so hard to find a lady friend to enjoy, even though I'm straight. And everything I do fails. And legitimately everything before - relationships and personal relationships have failed. 

I have nothing. And I'm starting to feel hate again. 

The worst part is that even though I fucking love the facade personality I put on, that golden person, I still always hate myself. I always will. If not for my ex calling me out I'd keep trying to do it. I wish I hadn't failed eight times. But again. I'm so fucking hateful.

Even though being in social settings is hard and new being alone is harder. Trying to reconnect but people are wary of you.

I'm an asshole.,1716087197.0,"First, for context; I was raised in a household where I would get either physically or mentally beaten if I did something wrong. For example, if I were to talk back to my mother she would mentally hurt me, which is why I have a low ego and constant suicidal thoughts. Now I'm an even worse person who gets mad every time someone comes into my room.

My mom believes that I am an asshole and I do too. I also get mad when anyone touches me without permission, causing me to flinch back and make them either worried or upset. I have lashed out at my own mother for touching me multiple times without permission and she tends to insult me when I do so.

I do have feelings, I'm not some emotionless person who doesn't care about anyone at all, (Not that people who hide their emotions are all like that) but I like to keep my bad emotions hidden since I used to get bullied for being the ***crybaby***. My bad emotions are saved until I'm at home and reading, that's when I let all my bad emotions out. Nobody cares about how I'm doing (if I'm feeling bad), and I enjoy that lack of attention; which is why I like keeping my emotions hidden.

I found a quote that perfectly describes how I am in public: *Chin up, Princess, or the crown slips.* I'm not sure where it comes from, or who said it, but in my mind I'm always saying to myself ***Don't show your emotions.*** I hate myself for this, but I feel I should find a way to get over it.

Anyways, enough backstory, I just accidentally hurt my dog because I was mad, but gave her some treats right after because I felt bad. I feel like an asshole because I feel like I mentally hurt everyone around me. I don't deserve anyone who's nice to me because I just put on a mask so I can keep friends. I'm the definition of a faker and I don't get why I'm still alive if I just hurt everyone around me. I take everyone for granted and if they get mad at me my mask just slips off. The only negative emotion I show in public is anger and even when I do show my anger I just get backlash anyways so I always try to apologise either the next day or in the next 2 hours. Sorry to anyone who's actually taking time out of their day to read this, I know it's long. I've been forgotten by my father, who left when I was born; He doesn't even have partial custody and he forgot that I exist, leading him to forget my birthday last year. I'm basically the opposite of a narcissist, (for anyone reading this who doesn't know what a narcissist is: it's someone who has too high of an ego) meaning I hate everything about me, from my mind to my body to my personality to my life. I have thoughts of death every day and I know most people want long happy lives, but I don't.

I kind of just feel the want to get on a private jet as the pilot and purposely crash the plane.

I do self harm, but not cutting, I'll get into that later. I already have the tools to hurt myself. I sometimes pick at my body while finding everything that people hate about me, even if they don't say it. I honestly am a brat, and my mom is so helpful at cheering me up. Lies. She is awesome at making me feel better about myself. Lies. My dad is always there for me. Lies. My life is absolutely awesome. More lies. I honestly hate everything about me, like I already said. I feel like everyone I love is so happy and has a great life, other than this one friend of mine who is going through the same thing as me. We both seemed to have started getting suicidal thoughts for the same  reasons. Our grandparents hate us (In my case grandparent) and they treat us like dog shit and as if we're not human. We also started having these thoughts at the beginning of our fourth grade year (In which we were in the same class.) The only two things keeping me alive right now is that I'm a fucking pussy who can't act on her thoughts, and that I have things to research that I wish I had. A recent example was a study of skin cancer. I enjoy starving myself, which is one of the only types of self harm I do; The other type of self harm consists of picking at my skin with any objects that will pinch, basically I would use a crab's claw if I got that desperate to feel pain. Pain brings me joy for some reason. I'm not talented, I'm only skilled. I have nothing special to keep me going and I'm a financial burden on my already struggling mother. Sometimes I just think of killing myself but then I think about why my mom would think. All of her friends either forget about her, abandon her, or die.

I can't talk to my mom about anything, because she's not reliable with emotions. What I can rely on her to do is feed my want for my life to end quickly.

I've also tried suffocating myself as if the self harm wasn't enough, (which it wasn't) and I've tried drowning myself multiple times. I'm just really tired of this sickening excuse for my life, if nothing brings me joy anymore. I'm not even that old, I'm not going to say my age but I'm not old. I honestly need to get my life together and suck all of my life's problems up; maybe from then on I can actually be happy. I have mental issues, which don't make this any better. I have frequent panic and anxiety attacks, (usually one after another) and I think keeping the mask of happiness isn't going to help me. If anyone else has been through this stomach twisting state of mind or anything remotely similar, please help me.

If this counts as anything, the two things that bring me a little bit of joy are designing my room and painting, which I don't even do often.",Former_Band2213,,False,1cveajn,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cveajn/im_an_asshole/

I feel tricked after being told it'll get better,1716083350.0,"I took pills 2 years ago, haphazard. I just got drowsy from it. Over time, I considered it more seriously. Made plans, scenarios, ruminated how to minimize the pain I'll cause. I was talked out of it by my sister. She told me things will get better. I did put effort in figuring what's worth living for. I planned cosplays, I tried to budget so I can have simple things to enjoy, I tried to be happy with what little I'm able to afford. If it's not obvious yet, I'm hella poor. I still live with my parents but not in a unemployed way, I help their small business because my mom spent her entire initial retirement money on it, and dad was hardly formally employed to receive support at his old age. Thing is I literally get 10%, rest goes to my fam. I can only afford treating myself to a hoodie once a month, I go to cheap coffee shops. Nothing big. My sister lives with us too, and ever since I asked her what she contributes (I never probe, I respect secrets, but the crashing debt was getting to me), and she said ""none"", I felt so off, I felt so worthless. She's a freelancer but she affords big industry printers that she never uses. She's always on out of town vacations, she stopped working full time so she can enroll in a culinary school to change her environment, she has full support coming from the family business I work in, which she doesn't contribute to. It feels so unfair realizing that she gets to only spend on her enjoyment. While I'm the one taking breadcrumbs after paying electricity bills, I'm the one worrying where to get money. I even suspect my mental condition is so severe because my face bloats from stress. This isn't all just finance related, my therapist diagnosed me with OCD, depression, and PTSD, and I'm still not fully accepting, and I had to stop therapy sessions after 2 years because I can't afford it anymore. But I'm ocd, I can't tell the dumbness I've gotten myself into because of my ocd. Before having this job, I used to sleep everyday for nearly two years after graduating college, I was yelled at everyday by my dad for it, he threw a chair at me, threatened me. I can't describe my life it's been all so painful. My parents are disciplinarians, I was belted, we were homeschooled as kids. I remember the environment being so severely tense as a child. But now I'm going on tangents. I just thought my sister was someone I can rely on, but now I feel neglected in every way. I'm in my late 20s and I've been trying so hard but I just feel lied to when people tell me it gets better. It's empty promises to get me going for no reason. I feel deeply manipulated after being convinced to delete notes on suicide, after tearing pages of my plans. It feels like I'm only living on for others' feelings. I'm guilty because my parents believe in hell after suicide. I don't believe in religious shit anymore, but I just can't leave them with the thought that their daughter is burning there. But lately I've been swinging between guilt and resentment. I resent how I've always felt responsible for other's feelings. I hate how easily guilt tripped I am. If I were to be selfish one day, and only consider my feelings, I would commit suicide. Because it's for me to stop this repetitive cycle of despair. I postpone and for what reason. I shouldn't be here anymore. Why am I even still here. I don't want to live another moment only to wonder what's the point. I try but I can't make life worth living for me. I'm resentful of my sister for not helping me, but I feel guilty for being resentful. it just feels so unfair and I want to stop feeling so worthless. I don't want to be talked out of ending myself when after repetitively struggling. Go on for nothing. I'm guilt tripped and more days will go by where life's not worth living, my attempts finding joy will always look pathetic. There's no hope and no reason. There literally isn't.

Parasitic,1716082128.0,"I'm nothing but a filthy parasite draining on my parents financially and emotionally. I've been unable to get a job for almost 4 years now. 

I have a few limitations but most people agree they are reasonable (I don't have to sleep somewhere that isn't home 3 nights a week to be able to get to work.
 I'm not standing for 8 hours in pain doing NOTHING, I'll stand 8 hours in pain if there's work to do.
I'm not lying to people to make them sign onto a 12 year financial commitment.)

I'm willing to do anything else. But Mc Donald's won't give me an interview. The rare 1 a season interview I do get ghosts me. Most applications just get ignored.
Meanwhile I'm here, using electricity my parents pay for. Eating their food. Asking them to cover my health expenses. My depression means I can't even fucking CLEAN UP for them. I'm an emotional toil. My dad feels like I stole his daughter from him (I'm trans) 
People keep suggesting welfare but that's just stealing MORE money from other people.

I'm worthless, I clearly can't even mop floors. I can't do data entry (had a temp position bit was let go after 7 workings days, only able to work 2 of them due to their system. Apparently I wasn't keeping up. A problem they never told me so I couldn't improve- as I had been, under advice of my peers, more focused on taking notes than the speed.)
I can't do anything. I've been in job employment programs but that doesn't help. Infact one of them, a film one I took, actually screwed me over unintentionally as I HAD a job, but took a break because film and media was my desired feild. And now as a result I can't get much other help. Turned away from a barista training program because I had received help. Yes where I live it's expected you take a course to be a coffee
 barista. It's 500$

I can't drive. I keep failing my tests putting my family out 200$ each time.
Everything costs money. And no matter what I do I cant make it.

So now I'm here, once again planning on just killing myself. So I can no longer waste space. Money. Resources. Oxygen. The world would be better, healthier, without a useless parasite like me hogging up food, water, and everything else. I can't even volunteer because I can't afford the buss fare to go there.
It's just... so pointless. I have no more will to do anything. My last attempt was hours into a resume and cv. My own design and people gave good feedback, but I've not got even an interview for that position I desperately wanted. So clearly I'm not good enough and can't do that either.

And then yelled at me saying they didn’t rape me and it was fault if anything ever happened and that I’m lying about it, I have to fucking get on the bus with on them every single fucking day. And she told them if they ever did anything wrong to me they should come out and apologize now, then she asked them if they ever assaulted me in any type of way and one of them lied while the other said nothing. Then she asked me why didn’t I tell her what was happening and why I didn’t do anything to stop it, and then she blamed it on my dad saying he had to do something to them first for them to do something to me. How can you not understand that they did it on their own account? And then she said I’m going to the up promiscuous like my older sister because she was molested also. One of my brothers apologized for raping me blaming it on hormones and how I was the “only girl in the house “ and I hope you can forgive me I know that you might not accept it but I’m sorry. And my other brother said nothing. And then my mother started blaming my dad for it again saying she failed all her children as a parent and how she failed me and that I should have came and told her what was happening. And then she said she forgives them for what they did to me and how they need to ask God for forgiveness, I can’t fucking comprehend how you can forgive them for raping me. I can’t stay here any longer and she keeps blaming everyone else for everything that’s happened and she always puts them above me and treats me like the black sheep.

I'm tired of living,1716079710.0,"In elementary school, I always was a very feminine boy, others kids didn't quite like it and bullied me for that to the point one day the girls locked me up in a bathroom for a whole day. I had to change school after that and I moved out.
I finished elementary school at another place where I became the person who would do the homework for everyone, still I thought this was what friendship was meant to be at the time and I didn't question it
Then came middle school. I got lots of health problems during the first year and needed to get a massive surgery (which was also a first timer given the case) done on me. My poor health led to another wave of bullying. One year later during a trip, I got raped by a classmate, someone came to get me out of the situation but when I finally got to tell the teachers they didn't believe neither of us. Following that, I got death threats during the rest of middle school from the rapist. My relationship with teachers also deteriorated from that point. The third year a case of thief got linked to me for whatever reason and I got a criminal case without even having a chance to defend myself. In the last year I discovered something was wrong with me, this was the first moment I experienced gender dysphoria but couldn't put a name on it at the time.
In highschool, I tried getting some friends, first year went relatively well except for me fighting with a lot of people. During the second year I started questioning my gender and also got into a relationship with a girl. During the following two years she invalidated every feelings I had and also repeatedly beat me up and used me for sexual favors. After highschool I left her and she then tried to convince me to kill myself, which I almost did.
Approximately at the same time, I lost all my friends because some got told by her thy I abused her, etc.. and some hide something from me : during a party we had, some people wanted to abuse me while I was asleep because I drank too much (I was out to those people), only one person stood up against it but no one told me directly what had happened. Then the year after that I tried coming out to my parents to which they replied they'd prefer me dead. I dropped out of the school I was at the moment as a result and broke down. The next year I went into uni, thinking it would be easier and because I needed to have objectives to not break. The first year I learned I got another health problem this time affecting my heart making me unable to do sports or any activity and shortening my remaining lifespan to about 10 year if left untreated.
 I am now at the end of the second year of uni, nothing has gotten better, everything went wrong in my life, I never addressed all the trauma I went through and I don't even have emotions anymore. 
I've thought about ending myself many times but never had the courage to actually do it, I always let knife slip right before piercing my throat. I may not want to live but I'm incapable of killing myself either.

My mother is 81.  She won't be around much longer.

Without my mother and wife I'll be homeless thanks to disability payments not covering living expenses.  

I'll have to give up my cats because I can't afford to take care of them.  

I live in New York City.  FFS it can't be hard to die here.  There's some sort of death trap every few feet.  But I can't break through my fear of dying to actually do anything about it.  

I'd just take a pill if I could.  But I'm afraid of pain, afraid of the nothingness of death, afraid I'll fuck it up and live a much worse life.  

The only method I think I could go through with is toxic gas, which runs the risk of poisoning others as well, since I live in an apartment.  No woods to go take a tent out into.  Hanging seems like a possibility but the only time I've managed to get the sliding knot right, I panicked and broke free.

I've started noticing myself just being unable to cope with everything that is going on in my life.   
I can see myself becoming more and more withdrawn. 

I've lost the joy in the things I used to do. 

I know I should feel scared but I just feel too tired to be scared.

I feel like I am in denial of being suicidal. I just want to say that I'm not because that's the right thing to say. ( of course that is the right thing to say. right? ) 

All I have now are frameworks that I've set up in the past to keep myself going. I signed myself up to commitments. Tied myself to others' life. 

I am starting to not really care what will happen to those if I am just gone. I have also been experiencing a huge inertia in making future plans. I just want to sleep and not think about anything.

I have been suicidal since I was 12. I have no idea why it started but I think I've been struggling with depression ever since. I had a few near attempts, the one I remember clearly is when I was standing with 10 of my father's blood pressure pills in my hands.
 I was 15 when I had the guts for the first time to tell my parents. I was told to exercise more and it was left at that.

Since then suicidal thoughts come and go in waves but never really leave. I know how and where I can do it when I need to. I'm disgusted with myself. The only reason I'm not dead yet are my pets. We have many, but I have two ""soul pets"", if you know what I mean. I love all of them but that one cat and dog are my best and only friends. 

I lost my cat in January to poisoning and I've never been worse in my whole life. I still see her from the corner of my eyes and the images of her having seizures still haunts me. When I see the vet clinic I break down. When our other dog has seizures (he has epilepsy and is checked on by a vet regularly), I break down. I see a cat that resembles her, I break down.

 After she was put to sleep I could barely get out of bed for two weeks. I didn't take care of myself and had to play stupid games on my phone all the time, otherwise I started sobbing. Now I'm either empty or just want to end it all. 

My dog is still alive, but he's old. Maybe this is his last year. Maybe he has two or three left. When he's gone, my last reason to stay alive will be gone with him.

human family sucks,1716074500.0,"we are so poorly evolved. i envy the creatures of wild nature that do not trouble themselves with adapting an inessentially complicated way of life. i envy the pack animals that assign roles for their community and commit to them. i envy the lone wolves that need not be taught how to make friends, do their taxes, or get a job — they have simplicity and its instinctual instruction emerges from within. humans are helpless, codependent, breakable, foolish, destructive. we leave our children behind, and they’d die. and they do. we make the wrong move, and a youth is traumatized for life. is there no potential mutation to protect us? from the world and from ourselves?

this all links back to today. i asked my mother if she could help me with something. she said yes. i further asked when she could help me, as it was something important and required for my job. she refused to give an estimate of when, just mumbled “i don’t know” “maybe soon” “….” i mentioned again, i kind of needed to know a precise date so i can make plans. she ignored me and looked at her phone for a while. i patiently asked again, she got angry, started yelling, saying i blame her for everything. i never said such a thing. i remind her that i’m not attacking her, i just needed confirmation. she says to leave her alone, and that she doesn’t feel like it anymore. i mention how this isn’t healthy and yelling isn’t necessary, how it makes me sad that i’ve been unable to practice proper conflict resolution in my life due to never learning it at home, and that it’s best to talk out the problem that isn’t as big as it seems. she says “my head hurts, i need to lie down.” she goes down to take a nap, and i bring her our cat, and it’s like all is forgotten in smiles.

is she bipolar? crazy rollercoaster of a post i know. i never interact with anybody like i do my mother. i like to hope it’s made me able to avoid these types of situations by knowing what isn’t stable behavior. it’s like i’m walking on eggshells and the prospect of asking for any favor sets her off. but yeah, looks like i’m not unlearning the “sleep away the pain” lifestyle anytime soon. that’s all she does. if anything makes her question herself and her behavior too hard, she would rather be unconscious. what a pitiful existence to lead. i work on my self improvement daily, promised myself i would never be so miserable. when i was little, she would sleep all day unless she was at work, and avoid talking to me. she doesn’t remember any of this of course. she claims to have taught me a lot. i mostly remember a lot of confusion and neglect and silence. sometimes i wonder if she’ll develop dementia or something else when she gets old, since her childhood and failed choices bother her so much. i think of this tweet i saw the other day, that said we aren’t here to parent our parents. that we cannot change their ways or help them be better when they don’t want to be. but it is so hard to resist when you’re watching an adult have an inner 5 year old’s tantrum. if i could afford to distance myself from their implosion i would. it’s a shame that humans are even allowed to procreate when they haven’t healed themselves beforehand. if only that was the order of nature. thoughtlessly passing along flawed dangerous dna has ruined us all.

but the moral of the story is: i hate how much you have to rely on other humans. how much you are at the mercy of your parents. how you are expected to accomplish everything by yourself but are given no tools or paths to doing so. how my mother secretly doesn’t want her children to ever be capable of moving out of her home - she wants slaves to gain help from instead. how during the brief summer when i lived with other relatives, she said i abandoned her, when it’s her husband who doesn’t pay the bills. i fear i’ll never be able to support myself, and i hate how i barely even want to, because i don’t even want to be here in the first place.

Do we matter?

The first thoughts of dying was when i was a teen. Being emotionally drained from everything made me eventually start imagining me killing myself in various ways. It made me happy to imagine my body just broken and dead. The only reason why i didn't do anything is due to the belief that i will be trapped in a hell circle of life. However, my imagination wasn't enough and therefore i moved to watching peoples deaths on cameras as well as gory images from crime scenes, which would somehow comfort my thoughts. So much so that i once spend 3+ hours watching footages of dying people, which remained in my brain for months as well as gave me nightmares and hallucinations. Now I'm almost 20, out of high school, jobless and probably the most depressed i have been ever. Being a transman on hrt as well as on anti depressants, due to my nervous system and emotions, is a nice combo to make me want to end it all.

My dad is a rapist. And I feel so much anger that I want to end my life.

He raped young secretaries at work (they were 17). He abused me till I was 8. Last year I heard he was sexually harassing other young children of the age of 14. He is not a hidden pedofile. Everyone knows. No one does anything. He is an ex businessman narcassist rapist. He has status.

I reported him in 2023. The was not enough direct evidence. Notes in a diary when I was 8 weren’t enough. They did arrest him, but he denied. His words: if you don’t know my daughter, you would believe her. A true confession if you ask me. Since ‘the daughter he knows’ would be a manipulative child that lies. No one thinks that. I’m the kindest shy quiet and honest person ever. He said: she thinks she is too important. She wants attention. She fucks things over. Always was a terrible child.‘We’ as a family have a lot of trouble with her. The ‘we’ does not even exist. My parents split up 25 years ago, they don’t even talk to eachother.

How did I get here.,1716070707.0,".

I’m 33F. Married. No kids. Teacher for 14 years. 

I had a horrible childhood filled with abuse and neglect. I did what everyone told me and was the first of my family to graduate college and get a job, thinking that was the key to having a better life than the people I grew up with. I became a teacher because it it wasn’t for the teachers I had growing up, I would have never made it through. 

I struggled HARD with what I now know what endometriosis and adenomyosis and fibroids and anything else that can go wrong in that area from the age of 9 until I had a hysterectomy at 31. All of my free time in my 20s was spent curled in with a heating pad, sitting in a tub of scalding hot water to ease the pain, or recovering from one of 12 surgeries to curb the pain and secure my fertility. 

The hysterectomy happened about 6 months after getting married. The husband was supportive at the time, but everything changed after that. Things got so bad I ended up attempting suicide a few months later. At the hospital after the attempt, my husband told me how dumb I was for choosing the wrong medication to end my life. I mean, he wasn’t wrong. 

Now, it’s a few years after that. I’ve been in counseling and on meds. Things are not much better. My working environment is miserable, mostly because of horribly mean and petty adults-not kids. At the same time, being around kids who are also abused and neglected and knowing I’ll never be a mom… not ideal. My husband detests me in so many ways. It makes him visibly angry when I get sick or have to take a day off work. He hates that as a teacher I get off most holidays and refuses to do anything around the house when I’m off. Like, purposefully leaves messes for me to clean. He is not in favor of adoption due to the cost. I honestly feel like he hates me and feels trapped. I’ve offered him an out, but he won’t take it. I think he’s afraid I’ll attempt again and that he will feel responsible. 

I do not have a support system of any kind. No family at all. My only friends are still friends with me because I think they are afraid if they let go, I’ll attempt again.

I honestly feel like I should have never had the hysterectomy, gotten pregnant, and let the pregnancy kill me. Everyone would have been so much kinder to me I think and I wouldn’t be so stuck where I am now. All along the way, I thought I was making the best decisions at the time. I just wanted to know what life would be like without searing pain everyday. That’s all. I thought life would be so much better and that I could accomplish so much more. I can’t believe how wrong I was. I can’t believe I am where I am and there doesn’t feel like a way out. Literally just damaged goods, waiting to expire.

even now that things are good with him, the depression and suicidal thoughts and allat arent getting any better, theyre actually getting worse. ive been having really extreme mood swings more often and more intensely, without him i cant even get out of bed or move around, ive barely done any of my schoolwork thats all due by july, and i still very much hate myself!

i pinky promised him i wouldnt leave him, that means no killing myself. i love him so much and i take pinky promises really seriously but i dont know why i did that, i hate it and i want to end everything but i know that im the only thing keeping him here, i guess that why i promised. but frick man :(

i dont know how long i can last, i dont have any sort of future im so incredibly stupid and lazy and i always self sabotage, how am i supposed to get a job or go to college one day? im 14 and ive already tried to kill myself multiple times, hows it gonna feel to be 18 one day??? 

i just dont know what to do. i dont know if i want advice or if i just want to write this down or something but i dont think any advice will help this time. 

im on medication, citalopram, that ive been on for a few months now since my last hospitalization and ive been begging my mum not to make me take it. i know she cant MAKE me but me refusing dtressed her out and i dont want to hurt her anymore i just cant take it. the feeling of taking them just disgusts me and reminds me of my attempt, they make me scared that its gonna control me and then im reminded everytime im happy that its not just me, i have stupid medication in me. 

i just dont know what to do. i cant avoid school forever, i dont think i have any sort of future, im genuinely just hopeless. i really wish he fell in love with someone else who was more stable, not me, hes the sweetest boy in the world and he doesnt deserve to have to always deal with me.

last night i got sad because we didnt have one of the ingredients to make a shirley temple at 1 in the morning and started crying, i got all dry and sad and i almost ruined his night. why the hell am i like this.

ive been asking my parents and doctors to test me for adhd, austism and bpd but they wont. i hate it. autism because of my anxiety, bpd because im 14 even though i know that they technically can test me, and adhd for whatever reason, they just wont. i want to kill them all. i dont understand why they cant just get me some tests and let me know whats wrong with me. 

my dad too, i want to kill him. i hate him. he ruins everything. awhile ago he (52?) got mad at my brother (19) and my mom (42?) was scared so i went out and he took off his hoodie and started going towards my brother aggressively so i got inbetween them and started SCREAMING at my dad that if he touches my brother ill kill him. now, like everytime, weve just been acting like nothing ever happened. why cant he aknowledge it and kill himself or something, i hate him. he refuses to stop drinking even when its ruining all of us and then he blames me for being young and ""selfish"" and ""ruining all of their lives"" i hste him 

i got a little emotional writing this so my bad, idek if anyones reading this but if you are have a great day and remember to eat (youre perfect, i pinky promise) and remember to drink some water and dont drink or smoke too much please and remind someone that you love them and just take care of yourself! bye bye, sorry!!

Told my entire life I was why my parents had to divorce. Because I was placed in a group home. I spent my entire k-5 locked in a small room. Do to undiagnosed depression and anxiety! 

Back in the 80’s no one gave a fuck about mental health especially in children. Always told just deal with it. Everyone lives suck, we can compare notes if you’d like. I’ve made federal judges cry.  

My entire life has been one fuck up after another. I got used by friends,family, bosses, courts. 

Life was manageable. Meet my now x wife started a a little family. We just finished college. I was working in the automotive industry. Not making much but a start. Do that work for some shitty people. And start to get to the point I’m ready to start my own. 

Well just a few months later I got hurt on the job. Had a life changing back injury. And lost everything over night even my tools. Which got stolen while I was recovering. 40,000.00 of my life savings y gone.  

Few years later I find a note how my wife isn’t happy anymore and wants a co worker. I leave and get begged back. We were apart 9 months and we talked about trying for or family. We did for another 13 years till a new little one came.  

This was my mental health breakdown. I raised my kids. When I worked I took care of them daily. My wife worked nights and slept till just before work. Feed the kids drop them off at daycare. And I didn’t want this life again. Was finally facing the fact I couldn’t work just before him I got my Ssdi. Before work comp is a joke! 

I started pissing blood the day he was born. I tried to talk to her. And she just went to the same old just deal with it any time I had an issue. That was here response anytime I had a struggle with the children at night I’m at work deal with it. I tried for so long. Till I started saying I was done feeling this way. Just for her to put of the time on me. My pains never matched her.

I’d rub her back while my screamed in pain. While my leg trembled in pain. But that’s what you do. And I’d get everyone has pain if I brought mine up. 

Well three later little one is now three and she starts coming home and going straight to her phone. And everything from dinner to how was work was a fight. 
I caught her cheating. She came home from work with an overnight bag in her truck. Said what’s that none of my business. Like yes it is! Well I’m leaving you. My suicidal tendencies started kicking in. And I tried that night with my dad in my truck. Telling me how life mattered not more then mine mf. We have history especially childhood abuse. Like I guess we both die today. 

She told me she was done with him, for her to leave that Friday. Dropping my kids off at her mother’s.  She lied about everything. Kicked me out well tried. Then took my two youngest kids three hours away and had my 15 year old daughter lie about where they moved. They both said only a 45 minute drive not three hours. 

Now a year and half later still playing her games. She uses I have a girlfriend against me. I’m still married to her I’m low income. And been fighting you want this divorce me. Since that’s been what she wanted since the day I found out, she has left my son to go chase men in other states with his teenage sister. He’s none verbal.

I came to the Netherlands to work and change my life, the company put me in an accommodation with 250 people from different cultures, and on my birthday after months alone and without friends and family, I bought this Xbox S, to play something and use my free time, the internet was to slow and was taking to a long time to download my warframe, I play this game from 2016 until now.
12 hours to download, so I bought wine just relaxed, and waited, I was there outside sitting in one of the trees taking some sum and drinking alone, I never drink too much, and this guy came and started to talk, my English is shit but was ok, he asked me some wine and I give, after some minutes I started to feel like in the clouds my body was not working good, I tried to get up but no strong in the leg and arms, I was feeling like I can't move and in jail inside myself, he took me to the woods and rape me I was feeling nothing, I couldn't do anything, I have no idea how long time this take, I just wanted to this stop, and I have some blackout, was dark when I was able to move and I finally got strong to move and I came to the room, I was in shame and guilty of myself, I was confused I sleep in the floor for 2 days and after that, I go to the police, they asked proves, video or photos, (wtf??) nobody helps me, I tried to work as nothing had happened and every time I looked to people I feel like they know that and I was feeling dirty, I started to use drugs to go work and try to get better alone, nobody will help me, I get that, here I'm a nobody, so in some moment I was not able to work (1 month later ) I put sick and I never come back to work, I made everything to run from that place, I find a room In other city and I just move in that same day, here, I found some silence and loniless, until this Bulgarian old guy started to bother me with small things, I cant wash my clothes always because he complain with the owner saying is too much, I can not cook because if I forgot just 1 seed of rice fall he complain saying I leave all kitchen dirty, I can not even pass in front his door he complain about noises.

I know this is hard on him and I can't even imagine what he is going through but one thing I do have experience with is death and being left behind and I can't do it again. 
The issue is, he knows me, knows what I've been through and has come to the correct conclusion that once he's gone I'll follow and he is adamant that he doesn't want that for me and that even though it will be hard I'll be able to carry on and be happy again so for him I want to be able to promise that I will go on.

I am on ssi and ssd getting 158 on the first and 805 on the 3rd. the ssd is after both my parents passed they put me on my dads disability drawing off what he earned working but I was originally on ssi to begin with.

I get about 963 a month total to live on. Right now I am in major debt with credit cards since covid broke out. I had to use them to live on. 

I moved in with my aunt who is living in apartments based on income but they are not section 8 but they accept section 8. When i moved in, i was told by the manager i didn't need to put my income since i was a cotenant. that was 10 yrs ago. come to find out. i had to put my income now i am being sued by the housing authority for 10k, i owe two more years. my aunt and i pay 220 a month to them. they don't care what happened they just want their money. 

i owe one credit card company 4.5k, another 1.8k another 600 and another 700. when i applied for them, it was 3 plus years ago. i put that i made around 700k a year when i applied to them but i was on ssdi at the time making around 11k a year. i went on the websites 3 months ago fixed the right info.

I live in a small town where nothing is available for the next 20 plus miles and have no transport. my aunt won't take me anywhere. her son who si in his late 30's lives with us and works. my aunt is on disability. I get food stamps right now worth a 130 a month which goes to my aunt even though its for me. i pay her 450 a month rent incl internet lights and 130 in food. if i don't give her the food stamps then i have to pay her another 130 a month i can't afford since all my stuff is going to her and credit cards. i legit have nothing left each month right now with having to buy myself instant mashed potatoes, oatmeal top ramen soup, noodles and spaghetti sauce. i live on that through the month. 

when she buys food with the food stamps it feeds her son, me and her. but it is only enough to last a week, then for the next 3 weeks i am starving barely eating because i can't afford much when i do buy stuff that i can put in my bedroom to eat on.

past week now, there has been no food, her son has been taking his mom and him out to eat all week not bringing anything home for me. im so hungry. the nearest food bank is 4 miles away one way, but i have no way to get there my aunt won't take me they don't deliver and when i tried getting medicaid transport to take me they said they don't schedule rides except to and from the dr's.  

I have no other family, I have no friends. I have no vehicle. been trying to get a minivan so I could live in it. I am sometimes bed ridden due to my bad joints/back/knees/feet/right leg nerve damage. I also struggle from morbid obesity I am around 500 lbs and funny thing is, with how little i eat. i should be losing weight but its the complete opposite. 

I will be 47 yrs old when I am out of debt with the credit card companies, I tried filing bankruptcy no one will touch me being under 10k in debt with the credit card companies. i contacted legal aid, the attorney who called me back said he can't help me because its under 10k. but told me how to file but chances of me filing and getting it are slim to none esp without legal help he said.

im thinking of ending my life next month when my aunt and her son leave for a week. I just can't keep living like this. if i had a minivan I could stay in it, do door dash for extra money, I could get around trying to find an aparment based on income. I bene accepted a few times to low income places but had no way to get there and now with all the debt I wouldn't be able to afford having my own place with the credit card debt.

if i stop paying the cards, and the debt collectors come after me,  they could take me to court and if they do, they could show the judge i said i made 700k a year and i didn't make that much and was on disability at the time and making only 11k a year. i found out while looking into bankruptcy that it is fraud and i could face prison time.

i just don't know what to do anymore. i really don't know what to do anymore other than ending things next month to get out of this situation i put myself in with my aunt, debt, etc. I just can't do it anymore esp without a vehicle. esp since I am bed ridden half of the day here and there due to my bad joints and weight that i have carried around for 30 yrs destroying my joints and causing nerve damage to my right leg. I can't just get up and go on the streets and live on the streets not with how badly im in pain every day esp just walking to the corner store. just a simple walk to the corner store and back and i am bed rested for an entire day barely able to move.

Confused,1716059722.0,"Hi everyone, I'm 24f and I have ADD (no full testing has been done though). I've been having these waves of overwhelming depression. At the end of last year, around November/December time, I got really bad. Since then, I've had one week or two weeks where I felt okay. During the bad times, my skin hurts. Not to the touch but like a burning/stinging sensation all over my body. Also, I'll go through waves of daily headaches where the sensation is also a burning instead of throbs. Thoughts are fully consuming and debilitating and many times I curl up unmoving because it feels like if I do they get worse. I'll just sit there, heart racing and the it feels like I need to do it. I panic with the ideas and the intense impulse and need to do it because what if the feelings do pass? But the more the waves come and with how long they last I'm starting to lose faith on the idea. The waves start out of nowhere and things don't have to be going wrong for them to start. Back in around 2019 is when I realized how controlling the thoughts are. I developed panic disorder and was prescribed lorazepam. The first time I took one my body wanted to take the whole bottle so bad the my arm was trembling cause I physically was fighting with myself. Luckily, I was able to call someone to take the bottle away. My panic attacks would last minimum 4-5 hours and happen also at random.

In the past few weeks and during this current wave a lot has happened. My home flooded about a year ago and we lost almost everything. This was my childhood home and my only sense of stability. We couldn't afford repairs and my grandmother sold it about two weeks ago. I went down to help with packing (I'm off in college rn) I could barely handle being there but I couldn't bring myself to leave. Also, a few weeks ago my uncle passed away. I haven't processed this at all. One of the things I was trying to figure out was how to reach out to them because a lot of my family keeps dying and I didn't want to lose anybody else with regrets. Years ago when my great grandmother and great great grandmother passed away, my uncles couldn't cope and went back to drugs heavily. Holidays became broken up with intoxicated holiday wishes. It was hard speaking to them when all the heartache on my end, but it's too late now. I know that I haven't dealt with death properly. I few weeks ago my lizard passed and when I went to pick him up it felt like I'd been electrocuted, my hands hurting the most. I wasn't able to remove him myself and had two wait a couple of weeks til my boyfriend visited. During this time I didn't go to the half of my room the enclosure is on (except for a few more attempts to try and get him and I had to do an online proctored exam at my desk.) I got him cremated and when the delivered his ashes is when my mom called to say my uncle passed.

The only person I really have a strong support structure is my boyfriend. With ADD, object permanence applies to people as well. We're long distance and it feels like he's not even real. It's hard to explain and I'm sure to understand if you don't deal with it. I've been reeling with this. Past bad times  (saying he hates me and the things he said/they way he has looked at me while drunk) has been consuming.

The only other thing I have is my cat. I can't keep him where I'm staying though so he's on the other side of the country with my boyfriend. He had medical issues about a year ago and I told them to go ahead with the operation. There's slim chance I would've continued without him. I wasn't able to make payments with the credit card company (CareCredit) so now they're taking me to court.

TW: SA and Domestic Violence 

My therapists brought up my past SA instances and asked me to go into detail them. My body feels so used and dirty. There was a domestic violence issue across the street a few weeks ago. While I witnessed it and debated calling the police (I did), I realized I do have trauma with how intensely I felt the fear.  

Sorry it's a lot, I want to just keep going but it would be rambly. With the severity of the depression waves and everything that's  been going on, I've been content with with the thoughts. Things have been a lot constantly in the past but the cycles never end. It's been really hard to complete school. I started in 2018 and I finished my Associates this recent spring. I really just don't have anything. Nothing I enjoy doing now and no thought for when I'm done with my bachelor's. I keep pushing, but as of right now I think it's only to stick around for other people.

My whole life sucks. Bad grades, horrible gpa, divorced parents and only one of them genuinely cares and supports me. Fully independent person, I've distanced so many ppl from my personal life that way they don't and can't know. I'm done with it all, at least my friends sometimes care about me. I'm always the one to get mad first and when I do get mad I can never calm down for days afterwards. I do so many sports to distract my mind from mental health issues. I just want to end it all soon. All my teachers hate me and same goes for all my school coaches. I only have about one week left of school at the current moment and none of my friends want to do anything with me for the last day of school. They all hate me because of a recent incident where I got in a fight and messed up the other guy (he deserved to be put in his place, he was beating up a freshman girl). Now I've been framed for the incident and everyone shames and looks down on me. Finals are coming up and I can't study because I have to write apology letters and texts and emails to various people to apologize for my recent failures. The one girl I have liked for a long time I was going to ask her out on the last day of school but none of those friends want to see me anymore. I try to be nice but everyyime I try to be nice I end up being the ""too harsh"" person in the end. ""Money can buy happiness"" my ass, I have plenty of money and it just makes me sick to the stomach to use or see any of it. I'm depressed and sad because of money. I have donated so much to other people and given back to churches and charities but it never makes me feel happy in return. I haven't smiled out of pure happiness in over 3 years and am cold and either too loud or too quiet. I'm extremely narcissistic and always want control of everything I can't have control over. I just want 5 more years to try and prove that life is worth my time that I have already wasted. Just have to make it to 20, then I'll make my decision. But for now I want to end it before my time is up. To the average person my life would seem amazing and so enjoyable but deep down it sucks and I just want to disappear off the face of the planet for good. The only thing keeping me alive is the fear that my father might follow in my footsteps because he's been hit pretty hard due to work and so many other things. My mom doesn't care about my own goals or thoughts and is never trying to be supportive or on my side of things. My brother is the only person I've trusted and he just sees another happy person instead of a cold, narcissistic, depressed kid who wants to die. I constantly think about just ending it all tomorrow but I know that if I do end it all, everything will fall apart even more and nothing will get better for anyone.

I love women, but I'm too ugly to get a second look, no matter how much I work out. it's always ""looks don't matter"" until they do. I have a severe stutter, and simply talking normally is such an embarrassment i feel like I need to die right then and there, which resulted in me almost never speaking outdoors anymore. I just need a reset man, but I don't know where I will go. I don't know if I'm going to finally be happy, or if it'll be nothingness. with no thoughts. I'll just be there, forever. I also know my brother will be clinically depressed if I ever killed myself, as he does try to cheer me up. I just don't know what to do

Intrusive suicidal thoughts ,1716058976.0,"Hello. When I was 16, I had a suicide attempt. It wasn't spontaneous, I planned it very carefully for several months. Then there was quite a difficult period, but I managed to look into the future and just tried to live. During these two years, I focused on my studies because I want to study at university for free, so I need to get very good exam results. From September to March, I was very motivated and focused on my goals. And then suddenly it changed. 

From March, I have lacked energy. It's hard for me to force myself to do something, and I don't see the point in my efforts and life in general. Since then, I have had a lot of suicidal thoughts, and I didn't even notice when I started making a suicide plan. I recently received my mock exam results, and they are quite good, but when I got them, I felt upset because it doesn't really matter since I'm going to commit suicide anyway. 

I feel that I am not the one who decides whether I will live or die. These thoughts are very intrusive, I cannot resist them, and it seems that the only way to stop them is just to act on them. I go to a therapist, but I'm afraid to tell her about it because I don't want to end up in the hospital (she already warned me about it). Why is this happening? And what should I do?

Feel like this is the end...,1716057813.0,"Feel like i'm done with life almost

Cant take it anymore.

I've started living alone with the help of my dad so I can live away from my stepmother who verbally abused me. Don't have a mom since she also abused and manipulated me as a child. Feeling like i'm losing contact with my dad and brother since I feel so disconnected from day to day, like i'm trying like survivaly meet them 1 or 2 days a week, but can't rely on them cause they still can't comprehend me (and sometimes my dad is speechless or can give me anything sadly). I have diagnosed from a physchiatrist that I have an emotionally inestable personality disorder. Last monday when to my therapist from the same center and ended up being so frustrating since I wasn't able to speak that I want to kill myself again, but can't go hospitalized again since Its expensive + if I don't study I won't be able to have the economic finanzes given by studing. Unable to sleep properly, already on meds but feel like they take no effect in these moments of crisis. Lost all contact with my group, feel disconnected.

Excluded due to a rape situation that I had in the past too due to the abuser accusing me of doing it to him while myself was already with suicidal tendencies, very low selfsteem and on meds that night, unable to say no due to the strongness that my meds felt and was scared since I was blank while he touched me, justifing himself cause he was drunk. Everybody believed him and I had to changed carrera cause the things they told about me almost made me literraly kill myself by getting hitover by a car and varios self cuts with even non cutting made tools (like some piece of plastic and non sharpened scissors). Batltling a lawsuit against him since 2 years but the university counsil still takes too long, and also says that my case was ""out of the limit"" due to being moments after 2 years, which the rules from that part says that they can't take cases if evidence that happened is over the 2 year limit. Still battling for it but is tiring.

Don't know if I will be financilly stable since my body is not capable of doing this anymore. It is not guarantted yet if I will be able to get more financial support for my studies since dad only compromised to pay me an student room if I maintin studing (and need to so I can earn money after I graduated, I want to but now I feel worthless). Felt like a waste of money and sure my abusive pasts will agree. Also my stepmother told me several times that I am someone fucked in the head, and at other moments that people fucked in the head should kill themselfes or be killed. I want to report her to authorities but she still living (and still married) with my dad who Idk how he feels about this anymore. There are even hospital records from my pasts psychologist that she told me that I'm fucked in the head. Feel like i'm financially abused in someway due to that if I report her, my dad would feel like to cut of my 1 of 2 only financial support that I have, since I ""escaped"" from my old house due to her abuse. I've even been hospitalized 2 times last year due to problems with her by base.

Also trying to appeal financial support for months, since I'm scared I'll end up homeless with no money to support my university carrer anymore. I don't want to come back to that old household i'm very scared of her that I tremble and I'm speechlees if I see her again. Want to avoid her at any cost.

Also ended up with no friends since my household problems ended up affecting me with my group, ending up relying on them too much that now they are gone. I almost see or talk with just 1 but the distance is there for me. Like I just want to be burried and get a funeral since I don't want to be a waste anymore. Want but can't sleep cause if I sleep I sleep like 15 hours, which scares me. Going to the medic takes like 2 weeks if I don't get hospitalized, and I don't want to and can't afford it. Last time I got hospitalized I was sacred for life when I heard the shouts of pain from one of the patients who had dementia and made me really scared, remind me of my own screams too.

Idk, I'm even poor and dont 3vent have motivation to kill myself properly. I just cut myself my upper legs and thats all I can do since i'm scared that if they discover in my residency i'm suicidal, they'll exclude me like all the people in my life that I met told them, since even i'm being told from other people that i'm being manipulative when i'ts just me who is on the border of life and death. Even dreams are more lively than real life.

I feel even worthless that the only joy that I have is seeing art of my favorite character who is also dead but is alive to me. Sometimes i would like to be with him by his side. Even tried it with character.ai at one point but lost motivation too.

I can't help myself anymore. And idk why my therapist said that i'm not like this and always telling me that I have all this things ahead, when my complete present is a boiling water that burns and eats my braing like i feel like i'll be like a vegetable by getting eated and eated mentally i can handle it anymore. There are no even painless methods to die since i would like to just sleep forever, since its the place that I feel mostly joy, not even real life...",LoyalNacho,,False,1cv44vo,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cv44vo/feel_like_this_is_the_end/

No way out,1716056696.0,"This is a throw away account. I'm not sure where else to turn. I'll be married 12 years in July. My wife has suffered with extreme OCD the whole time. It's been very controlling and consumes her and me. We haven't made food in 10+ years at home, we can't have people over. It got to a point where I had to turn 90 degrees when walking down a hallway so my shorts wouldn't touch things. She has had extreme jealousy issues our entire marriage and also controlled what I ate. When we're out of the house, and her anxiety is low, she is an amazing fun person, but the years got to be too much. 6 months ago or so I was back in my hometown and after 20 years of not seeing her, I stopped to pay condolences to the girl (her brother had recently passed away) I've always liked growing up (we never dated, I never thought she was interested). Well turns out she was interested and after a 2nd day of catching up and being together we kissed. I returned back home, and my wife's OCD his new levels of controlling me. I ended up breaking and saying I didn't love her and I wanted a divorce. I just wanted out. I wanted to be free. I felt so trapped and suffocated and I also ended up telling her about the kiss. Fast-forward to today, we've been doing counseling. My wife won't divorce me. She has nothing. No job no family. I don't feel like I can leave her. We're Christians and she says how we are to stay married no matter what. I'm stuck. I will never get out of this and those in the Church continue to push for us to stay married. She brings up the kiss nearly every single day and makes me feel like dog shit. I do and I know my actions were wrong.

Times change but people never really want to. Begging for the perks without the works. Never learn anything new because nobody instilled in you, the need to. But somehow expect to be a burger flipper that makes 30 bucks an hour but become enraged that I sold a company an automatic burger flipper that's cheaper, more reliable and ultimately.. Just better.

"22M and worthless, better off ending it all. Can't find a fucking job.",1716055942.0,"I'm 22 and just recently graduated from college with my associates in Social Media Marketing. I moved out of the dorms a month ago to live at my grandmas until me and my gf could find a place of our own and so I could find a job. My city is scarce for opportunities and I applied everywhere around here I could and to some places a couple hours away. I heard back from none of them except one who basically told me they didn't like my portfolio. So I figured I'd settle for an entry level job like retail until I can find a job with my degree.

Heres the issue. I'm extemely picky about jobs. I won't do any fast food, I won't do register/cashier work, I won't do heavy labor and a lot of lifting, and I won't take below $14 hourly with raises to come. Throughout college I just focused on school and didnt work. So I was very frugral with my savings but I don't have much left and need a job soon because my grandma is selling her house and planning to move states this summer. I need to get out and have my own place by August likely, maybe sooner. 

I've applied like crazy to many retail positions near me and only got 1 call from Walmart offering me a cashier position which I declined, I'm autistic asf and can't stand for 8 hours+ at a register. I did get hired at Sams Club as well for a personal shopping position a week ago but my dumbass got anxiety because of my crohns disease and some horror stories I read on Reddit about that position so I ended up calling the manager and quitting 3 hours before my scheduled time. I regretted this choice after and tried to get the job back and the manager already hired someone else in my place. 

So yeah. Can't find a job and stuck living in my grandmas basement without a way out anytime soon. I'm better off killing myself. My degree was a waste of fucking time and money and energy.

i miss being normal so much. i was really happy from the ages of 0-5, my issues started around age 6 but from ages 6-10 i lived a decent life. maybe a little therapy could benefit but i wasn't fucked in the head. 11-12 was the decline and so was 13 kinda but 14 is when shit blew, and now it is worse at 15. i look at my old videos or entries or anything and i'm just like 'god i miss being normal'. if she saw someone like me back then she would think they are crazy. it is so wild i was once normal. i had my insecurities and slightly troubled due to certain traumas but for a traumatized person i was extremely stable. all i ever wanted was to be happy again, and now i give up. i should just end it all

By the time you find this letter, I will have gone where your love can no longer reach me. I am so sorry for the pain this will cause you, but please understand that this is the only way.
For so long, I have tried to hide the darkness that has slowly consumed my soul. Each day has been a battle, a desperate attempt to cling to the love you brought into my life. But the problems were always there, growing stronger with each passing moment.
You were my beacon, the one who gave me a reason to smile when I thought I had none left. You held me when I felt like I was falling apart, and your strength gave me hope when I had none. But the burden has become too great for me to bear. I can't go on anymore 
I want you to know that this is not your fault. You did everything you could to save me, to heal me. Your love was the only good thing in my messed up world . I'm  eternally grateful I met you  
Please remember me not as someone who gave up, but as someone who tried so hard to stay. Remember the moments of laughter we shared, the dreams we built together, and the love that was so real and pure. Keep those memories close to your heart and with that goodbye.

I can’t go on anymore,1716048757.0,"I’m tired and the noise won’t stop. 

I (25M) have been dealing with a lot that life has handed me. It’s too hard for me to handle and I just can’t take it anymore. 

In April 2023 I received a phone call that my niece who was only a few months old had suddenly passed away. A few hours later I got a phone call that my older sister, the mother of my niece, had passed away. It crumbled me. But I tried to keep it together. Life had already been a bit tough considering our father had passed away in 2014 and a few months after that our house burned down so we had to restart. But I was trying to stay healthy and happy while I grieved and kept going in life. 

A few months later in September 2023 I received a phone call that my stepfather lost his fight with lung cancer and he passed. He was like a father to me. When I didn’t have a dad to show me how to be a man he stepped up. Took care of me and helped raise me in my teenage years. Losing him hurt. It was like losing my dad all over again. 

December of 2023 came and I was waiting for the year to be over. To start fresh. Keep on going and pick up where I left off on my goals in life. But life had other plans and I received a call that my other older sister was in the hospital and dieing. I flew across the country to be with her. I watched her die on New Year’s Eve night. Another sister gone. Another family member gone. I’ve lost so much and it was so hard but my partner and soul mate was with me to help take care of me. She tended to me and helped me when I struggled. 

2024 came and I was still going on strong in life. I was trying to save money for a wedding and to propose to my gf of 4 years. She had been with me through it all. I stayed strong most of the time. I was able to find happiness and light in such dark times. I would break down every now and again. Sometimes by myself and sometimes I would seek my significant other for help. I didn’t want to be a sad depressed person all day everyday. In April of 2024 my gf who had helped me day in and day out for 4 years said we needed to talk. She said she felt I didn’t care about her, I didn’t want to spend time with her, and that she was tired of feeling not cared for. She packed up her things and left. In a matter of seconds I finally lost it all. Disappeared. 

Essentially I just can’t take it anymore. I’m trying a therapist but it isn’t helping much and I don’t want to be put on medication. I wake up every morning, panic frantically, look around at my empty room, and get nauseous from the panic that I vomit. I can’t help it. Every morning. My mind doesn’t stop. It’s like an old train that keeps running. Metal grinding against metal. I think of everything. Every situation. Every outcome. The past. The future. The present. It doesn’t stop going. It’s a loud noise and I’m so exhausted. I’m tired emotionally, physically, and mentally. I want to break down and cry as she holds me. The noise won’t go away and I want it to stop. I want to end it. I can’t do this anymore. Everything is dieing around me. Everything I touch dies except myself and it’s not fair. I’m too tired to keep going.",Internet_Mediocre,,False,1cv0rl4,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cv0rl4/i_cant_go_on_anymore/
I’m done. ,1716048661.0,"I (23F) know this is supposed to be a place where we get support for suicidal thoughts, but really, I don’t want any “support” right now. I know others will be hurt by my actions, but I really don’t care anymore. It’s not enough of a reason to live. Living for other people will only break your heart. 

I have nothing left to live for. My career is in the toilet. My “friends” are all fake or they’ve left. I have always had really bad runs with romantic relationships, I choose toxic people, and I’m toxic too. I know it’s because being chronically depressed and suicidal doesn’t make it easy on anyone. I wish I could make it stop, but I can’t. I am just so unhappy. 

I cried for hours yesterday. Literally nearly just 8 hours. I went to sleep and woke up, thinking it would might clear my head, but I still feel the exact same. I am set on my decision. 

I’m a failure, and I can’t live while that is true. There’s nothing I can do to change it either. I’ve been trying for years, but I am what I am. I can’t keep going anymore.

I can’t live without my cat ,1716047569.0,"My cat went missing a few days ago. I can’t remember exactly how many days because a family member was briefly in the hospital, and my life has been chaotic ever since. Maybe I would have noticed he was missing sooner if things had been different.

He was the most loyal cat. In the nine years I’ve had him since adopting him as a kitten, he had never been missing for more than a day. I live in a rural area, so he always had the choice to go outdoors and indoors as he pleased. During the day, he’d usually hang around outside by the barn or wherever his people were, and he’d always come inside at night for dinner and stay inside until morning. If I didn’t see him at the door right away, he would meow or scratch on the wall until I let him in.

He was a very healthy cat for his age, and I wasn’t expecting to lose him anytime soon. I miss him so much it’s soul crushing and unbearable. And it’s all my fault. By the time I realized he was missing and started searching, calling, and putting out food for him, it had already been longer than he had ever been missing before. Without him, I feel like I’ve been living the same day over and over again for the past week. All I think about is killing myself it’s the only thing that consumes my mind.

I’m going to be 33 and I wouldn’t say there was anything major that acted like a catalyst tipping me over the edge. Everything has just slowly chipped away at myself enough to where I do not believe anything will change or more importantly I don’t believe I can change. I don’t have any interest in what the rest of my life would be. I don’t understand what is wrong with me. I never had real friends growing up like everyone else did. I don’t know how to talk to people. I went through college alone. It’s been a decade since then and I still don’t know how to talk to people or have friends. I don’t have any self esteem. I don’t enjoy anything anymore. I don’t have anything of interest to distract me from being a total loser. I always wanted to get married and have kids as far back as middle school, but I would be a fool to still continue to think that will happen. I can’t even have a friend. The only thing that kept a glimmer of hope was that I don’t think I’m unattractive and I’m in somewhat good shape. But socially I’m hideous. I don’t use Facebook or anything and the times that I considered it, I remind myself that I wouldn’t have any friends to add or pictures to show so people would think something must be wrong with me and I would be embarrassing myself. I know that even my parents think I’m a loser and say it without actually saying it. I think I would have killed myself already if they weren’t alive. Other than knowing it would probably devastate them, I can’t come up with any reason to not kill myself. I don’t matter in the sense that I don’t have a wife, children, or even a pet that relies on me. I’m easily replaceable at work. I don’t have any friends to even know if I disappeared. Honestly, no one would know for weeks. The first to know would be my apartment complex after they would eventually enter my apartment for not paying my rent. I feel so humiliated and alone and sad and weak and worthless and defective and don’t understand what was and is wrong with me. I fooled myself into thinking everything would work out growing up because I was a good, nice person that no one disliked. At the same time though I didn’t let anyone really get to know me beyond being a good, nice person. At the time, I couldn’t see how harmful that would be, but after years and years, the harm added up and destroyed my self esteem beyond repair.

abortion - no heartbeat - no confirmation scan. Depressed ,1716043672.0,"My girlfriend went to an abortion clinic with our first conceived child (that hurt)

When she was there, they measured her pregnancy and told her she was measuring 6 weeks and there was no fetal heartbeat.

My girlfriend was in pain - but instead of going to the doctors and checking on why she was having pain.. she went to an abortion clinic instead. NO.. not planned parenthood.. an abortion clinic. You can look them up. Here in the UK. Look up BPAS for example.

I never wanted her to get an abortion... she tries to justify it by the fact the embryo had no heartbeat and she was in pain but I asked her to get the pain checked out at the doctors and instead she just went to an abortion clinic.

I have researched extensively and find out that 6 weeks is when the heart starts to become detectable and sometimes its just not quite detectable at 6 weeks and that doesn't mean it was a miscarriage.

Its been 10 years.. I have no child.. I have broken up with the love of my life - why? Because to confirm miscarriage you need to have two scans.... because it shows that the baby has not grown a week later and is still lacking a heartbeat that is definite and that is the absolute standard for diagnosing miscarriage if they embryo is below 7mm in size.

I believe children should be protected in the womb.. especially my child... I cant help but resent my ex for this.. Im now 10 years older with no child and Im just so depressed.

Every time I think about her I miss her but I also think... you are the mother of my deceased child and I cant be sure your actions are the reason ill never get to meet my child.. How do I actually mve on in life.

I dont agree with abortion. Can any body tell me if im over reacting. Again.. NOT PLANNED parenthood.. didnt want her to get an abortion ... she told me she did it because the sonographer told her no heartbeat... but in a lot of cases at 6 weeks it just isnt detectable and the baby is fine.. so now I have to wonder for the rest of my life if it just wasnt too early.. I really am struggling.

I don't think I will ever find anything that will make the trauma I have gone through ""worth it"" enough to keep living. My therapist and I talk about this a lot. They ask me if it has to be one thing that makes everything worth it, or if it could be a lot of small things. It doesn't matter, because there is nothing. I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what could make living worth it for me. I don't want to get married, I don't want children, I love my job and I love my friends but neither of those make my past easier to live with. 

I can't even begin to imagine what could make it worth it. There are things that I want to do before I die, random little things, but none of them matter so much to me that I absolutely have to do them before I die. I could kill myself without having done any of them and be fine with it.

My therapist talks to me about trying to be more present in the positive moments of my life so I can learn that there is more to it than just negative experiences. I don't care. Truthfully, I don't want to do that. I don't want to keep looking for reasons to live. I have looked, I have been looking, for a long time. I haven't found anything.

just can’t be asked to have hope anymore,1716030021.0,"I am not happy in life, I don’t even know what makes me happy in life. I was dating a girl in March till may, before her I was depressed and didn’t see the point of living, I didn’t see a future for myself, I thought no one would want me for me, cause I have boring personality. And I was hoping she would leave cause I was like it is too good to be true, to have something so good in my life, but eventually I started to trust something good was happening for me, how silly of me!

She broke up with me because she felt no spark, no excitement and felt that something was missing. Before she became my girlfriend she treated me so well, did so many thoughtful things for me. Made feel special and luckiest girl in the world. 

She was my first relationship and my first everything with a woman, just not my first date with a woman. I’m bi.

I never felt the things I have felt with her with anyone, I looked so much into our future, what our life could look like and ofcourse had worries about coming out.

It’s going to be 2 weeks on Sunday. And I have kept myself deliberately busy on weekends, I’m going for drink with a friend today. 

Anyway I have been depressed before her, and I don’t think that’s something ever going to change, I asked her multiple times if it’s really the spark thing but I wonder if she found me really boring.
She did reassure me that it is nothing I did, never been treated better etc. 

I feel fucking alone in life. Even my friends make me feel lonely and unlovable. It was birthday in March and I didn’t get any gifts from them, the only gift they gave me was a lazy, pay for my dinner when we hung out, while I gave them gifts. I was looking forward to the gifts. All my friends are pretty much surface level at the moment and friends have just drifted apart as we are all doing different things. I didn’t even get wished by my brother and I wished him for his birthday 

Even my own family,my parents are emotionally distant, nothing I do makes them happy. They praise other people’s kids.  Never once have I heard from them I am so proud of you, you did so well in your degree, you are such a good kid. Never. I do so many nice things for them like I brought a plane ticket for my dad and mum, I paid some money to get a phone for my mum. Just thank you is all I get. I never feel appreciated. 

When I talk about my struggles with life, to my mum I am made to feel like a burden. When im sad my mum says it stress her out, but never actually tries to help me out or ask me to talk about it.

I can things like I wish I was actually hit by bus. I would have been accidentally hit by a bus few weeks ago, it’s a miracle that I didn’t and I still wonder how I didn’t get hit. Cause it was SO close. I basically didn’t know the bus would be come on the road I was crossing on, it was near my work, I never been in that area before.

I even said stuff like one of these days I’ll jump in front of traffic, I don’t get any reaction from her. My father is the same emotionally distant. I feel like they had kids because of society. I am making a promise to myself to never bring my own child into this world. But sometimes I think about how much love I could give to my own kid, and really listen to them. Do the opposite of my parents. 

I went to work party and I never felt so lonely, loneliness never seems to leave me no matter where I am in life, I have felt this loneliness all my life. I never fit In anywhere. Nobody seemed interested to want to know me. And even coworkers I sit next to, they were never like stick with us for the party. To credit, my one coworker I sit next to did check up on me, she was like are you ok? Having fun etc. I would have stayed next to her but I literally had nothing to say, I didn’t want to stick around her the whole party since the whole point is to meet people, and also didn’t want to make her feel uncomfortable. It was so sweet of her to check up on me! She even said to text her when I get home. Like atleast one person cares about me tiny bit.

I have always struggled to find things to talk about, and it doesn’t help that I have memory problems. I tried adhd meds, didn’t help. I got them privately and I’m not paying a fortune for something that doesn’t work.

I do work for a weed company, I have heard stories about how much it helps patients deal with life. I still haven’t tried weed yet! But I guess my life was doomed from the start, I imagine if I supported during my childhood when I was struggling, I wouldn’t have half the problems I had. 

I’ll stick around for few years, travel for a bit and then end it all someday. I can imagine living the exact same life till I’m 80. Someday the loneliness will be so strong that it will push me over the edge.

I don’t why I am a people repellent. I wish I knew what it was about me that makes people to keep a distant and uninterested in me. All my jobs I have felt lonely and yes I know you are there to fucking work. 

But I just struggle socially. I don’t know how people find things to talk about and I really did try to talk to people. There weee few people from my home country and one would think it would be so easy to bond over but they had no interest in wanting to know me.

I was happy when I had a gf, things weren’t perfect like most relationships. but I would have wanted to be with her and work on things. But you can’t make someone to choose you. And I definitely wouldn’t want her to settle for me when she isn’t happy. She said we could remain fiends after the break up but I’m scared to message her and find out that she never meant it . I feel like most people offer to remain friends so it will soften the blow. I had secondary school friends say let’s keep in touch but never do.

I ran into my secondary school friend this week and she was like oh we should hang out, I wanted to message you etc. and me being me I texted her let’s hang out on Sunday and no response. Fml.

finally feeling good,1716025872.0,"this reddit account is basically my diary and i can write longer posts than on my twitter so, even if this isn’t exactly the right subreddit, for once im making a slightly more positive post. 

Ive never been the outgoing, cool, walk-into-a-room-and-everyone-says-hi kinda girl. Never been someone whose name is mentioned in the rooms they aren’t in. I’ve always been so anxious and kept to myself so much i could probably be clinically considered selectively mute. 

In a class at the end my senior year, a girl i had sat next to all year and had been going to school with for 7 years (and i briefly sat with at lunch in 6th grade), asked me what my name was. A girl came up to me in a class once after a presentation and told me she “didn’t know i could speak that loud”. My supervisor came up to me after 3 months of employment and said “i don’t think i’ve ever heard you say a word”. In a meeting where we had to write strengths and weaknesses of our peers, every single one of them wrote i needed to speak up more. 

People don’t realize the kind of struggle it is. It’s not that i’m quiet for fun! I’m quiet because I am thinking about everything all of the time. It’s just how my brain works. I need to collect all of the information. I need to process all of the information. I need to analyze every second of every day and if there’s nothing new then i’m thinking about every thing that has ever happened to me. And i think that’s how i ended up how i am. 

I’ve struggled with depression since i can remember. I was a happy enough kid, but some sort of darkness consumed me. I was a chronic over-thinker (and still am). I’ve been suicidal for years. It comes in waves, but there’s a constant voice somewhere in there telling me there’s no other way out of this. To me, the worst part is that there is no single traumatic event i can link any of this to. It’s all just some sort of genetic mishap or some crossed wire. That part consumes me; no one to blame, nothing that could have been done different, no other way this could have turned out. 

I turned 19 this past year. From 14 onward, i told myself i wouldn’t make it to adulthood. Then i made it to adulthood, and it turned to “i won’t make it to graduation”. Then i made it to graduation. And now it’s been another year. Every tomorrow has been a question of today. 

Something changed recently. Once again, no single event to tie it to. Maybe it was getting hit in the head by a basketball by some kid at work, or swinging at the park with my childhood best friend, a pot of kraft mac and cheese made with a little extra love.

I started talking!

I started speaking up about things that i notice, and people actually appreciated it. i learned how to make small talk. (kinda). it was really had pushing through the extremely thick walls i had built. but i think it’s paying off!

Now i can think past tomorrow. I’ve been working towards a career, figuring out what’s going to work for me and what i can work towards. I’ve been doing interviews, and the people around me are truly supporting me in ways i never imagined. 

I look at the past and pick it apart bit by bit and it feels like nothing has changed. But i stood back and took a good long look at the whole picture. And everything is different. I hope it keeps changing. ",throwaway183746289,,False,1cutsic,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cutsic/finally_feeling_good/

Finally Honest With My Therapist,1715975708.0,"Hi.

I have cerebral palsy, which carries chronic pain along with it. I also have ptsd and epilepsy.
I constantly go through depressive episodes due to this, but when it comes to actually talking about the thoughts I get, I tend to downplay and choose my words very carefully, not because I think he'd break confidentially, but because I didn't want to admit how bad it really was (over the past two years, this therapist has become one of the only people I feel I can trust fully).

Anyways, during a severe bout of pain, I had a heavy amount of death/Sui thoughts. When this happens, I tend to email my therapist, but again articulate it in a way to shift it away from outwardly admitting these ""thought of death"" are passively (and at times, actively) suicidal. However, this time, while still intentionally vague,  I made it clear that I know I need to talk about this, and worded it in a way where he may or may understand .

Spoiler: He understood. Fully. Fast forward to our session and I had a particularly rare good couple days. I started to talk about that, and he let me, but then he steered me back to my email.

We had a long, brutal talk. Inpatient commitment was talked about, but not in a way in which he felt I was in immediate danger. The way he worded it, he hates having to involuntarily commit people and would rather people be able to say, ""I don't feel safe,"" and choose to get help themselves before it reaches that point.

That conversation helped me breathe better as now I'm more open to talking about this. I've heard horror stories of therapists jumping to committing people, so I'm glad I have a good one. He is almost certain I'd be angry with him if he involuntarily committed me, but knowing him, I would have to be so close to attempting (or accidentally going to far with SH) that he'd have no choice, and by that time, I'd probably be so tired that I wouldn't fight it. 

As far as voluntary commitment — has anyone ever done that? What's it like and did it help?",thatmentallyillchic,,False,1cuema0,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cuema0/finally_honest_with_my_therapist/

Despite fleeting moments of happiness earlier in my life, I cannot recall a single phase of my life that was truly joyful.

I am green with envy. I know within my heart of hearts that I will never find peace until I can be where he is, in the great nothingness. 

Ending this suffering is the only honorable choice. It is not a selfish act,like portrayed on TV after school specials and very special episodes but rather a selfless one. Putting an end to this is in everyone's best interest. It is time to bring this horror to a final close.

Miserable Life,1716020199.0,"Life has become tedious and unbearable.  I have a hard time seeing what the point is anymore.  I’m tired of going through the motions and repeating the same routine EVERY single day.  Work. Sleep. Eat. Poop. Repeat.  I simply don’t enjoy anything anymore.  My faith is shaky.  I’m tired of the spiritual battle.  My demons are winning.  The world is so fucked up.  I wish an asteroid would hit us and destroy earth.  Humanity needs a reset.  The degree of evil in the world is abhorrent.  The hate we have towards one another makes me sick.  I also know too much about how the world works and how evil the people who control things are.  We are living in a matrix where they control the way we live our lives.  Death seems to be the only escape.  My fear is that we are also destined to come back into this miserable world.  There are vampires who feed off of our fear, anxiety, and despair.  They get high off adrenochrome from the blood of tortured children.  The start and fund wars. They poison our food, our water, our air.  They distract us with their media, sports, and celebrities.  I used to have hope that there would be a revolution and we could change things but I feel hopeless that these demons will remain in power.  I feel powerless to improve my life.  I also feel that I have wasted my gifts and many opportunities I’ve had to do something with my life.  But I am an absolute failure.  I have failed to live up to my potential.  The only thing that is stopping me is my little boy.  I know it would wreck his life and he would never get over it.  Neither would my wife but I feel they would be better off without me.  I don’t want to be a burden anymore.  My life has had no significance.  I didn’t make the world a better place.  Like everyone, my life has just been about surviving.  Working and paying bills.  I also have a lot of medical bills from being in the psyche ward because I was depressed and suicidal.  I don’t want to go back.  We spent all that money for nothing.   What a waste. I was starting to feel somewhat normal and could function again.  As each day passes the reality hits me that I have nothing to look forward to.  Death is my constant thought and I just want my suffering to end.  I wake up and I ask God to kill me and put me out of my miserable existence.  If you read this, thank you.  I needed to get that off.  I don’t know how much longer I’ll be around. I have a rope and plan on hanging myself since my wife forced me to sell my gun.  That would have been so much easier.

One step closer,1716019924.0,"I got a step closer in my plans. I don't have a specific date or exact conditions for executing but I know where I want myself to be when it happens. I also have my red lines (no jumping in front of a train for example...; mainly because I don't want to put anyone through getting to recognize the body in that condition). Unfortunately some situations out of my control are pushing me closer and I would prefer to have more control over when but time may be running out... So I got a gun license. One step closer. Trying different guns now to see what I am going to buy. Weird, as I am not that much into guns, that I want to choose the most suitable one for me. I might still go shoot the the range once in a while so I might as well get something that I like and fits me. I feel like having a gun is not going to necessarily take me closer to the end but help me go on, as I will know that I have an easy way out, if shit gets to be too much.

As mentioned though things are not good in a way that it is not easy to fix. I am now not happy about everything moving faster and not having control. Anyway, I have accepted my condition a long time ago. I rationalized it, so I am able to take some, even a lot, of the emotional aspect out of it (not always, sometimes I feel really sad and sorry for myself; it does suck; I had a very good life and opportunity but lost it all, especially my love, what really matters in the end). The worst thing is to need to make such an important decision and planning and not being able to talk about it with anyone. So I put it here. I created a new user as my previous one could be traced to my real identity if you were a bit smart. This one should be pretty hard to link to me

I even tried to get some mental health support but: 1) I am not really into the ""talking"" therapy. I rationalize everything. I am a firm believer that a shitty life is not worth enduring. So the ""be positive"" talk doesn't work for me; 2) taking additional medication is counterproductive; as of now, as I also have some physical objectives and training/competition accomplishments that I want to achieve, and medication messes with my fitness (I am almost there on those ones :) ); 3) if I say too much, doctors can advice the authorities against gun ownership or even riding a motorcycle, so it is either lying, which makes the therapy non-effective, or just not going at all

So, again, writing it here as a sort of journaling exercise but hoping to ""talk it out"" a little because it is becoming hard to keep all this inside, especially now that I am starting to write drafts of the letters I want to leave and make some financial arrangements (for the little shit that I have left)",fbi-surveillance-bot,,False,1cusg7v,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cusg7v/one_step_closer/

I’m 15 and I hate myself and my past,1716014188.0,"When I was 13 (around the start of 8th grade) I  liked this girl ,(at the time 13, who I’ll call “EX”), and asked her out about 2 weeks into knowing her  (I knew her a little previously) and I guess we started dating. About a week or two later she started being more sexual. She sent me videos talking about sexual things she’d want to do to me and I didn’t know whether to be uncomfortable or aroused. I decided to do the same back to her but a lot more straightforward and I’d just suggest stuff. The point of this isn’t about her but instead about this new girl(15, who I’ll call GF) I’m 15 now (end of 9th) and I really like GF who likes me back too. We’ve been talking for 9 months and we both confessed we liked each other around February this year. We aren’t technically dating since she needs permission from her mom but I told her that when we do, she’d be my first girlfriend. I feel guilty about saying that since I guess I technically dated EX. And that has me thinking a lot of how much of a bad person I was since I also told her that (when we kissed) that was my first kiss. And I felt more guilty thinking of all the stuff I did with EX. I’ll spare you the time by saying we got sexual (no sex), hugged, kissed, and way more stuff that I told GF I’ve never done. I’ve made GF think like I’m an innocent person. My relationship with EX was kinda public (my mom didn’t know) but I still felt a little embarrassed with her in school for a reason I don’t know. I also decided that one night to start telling people that she sexual assaulted me (after we broke up) for some reason. I assume I felt like she did but I don’t remember. I also also decided it would be funny to “make a joke” that I would only go to bed if she sent me a nude, kinda like the “when pigs can fly” phrase basically meaning she’d never do that. She did do that and I felt extremely bad. I let all of that go and was fine until I met GF. I now fear that 2 years later all of that will come back to bite me and ruin my relationship with GF who I care so much about. I also feel disgusting for lying to GF about her being my first girlfriend, kiss, among other things. I feel like a shitty human being as I have for a while. Worst thing is that EX was a mutual friend to a lot of people I fear that she has proof of me doing all of that stuff and is going to expose, which would ruin me and GF’s relationship. Me not saying all of that isn’t technically hurting our relationship since most of that I felt wasn’t out of love but I’m 100% sure I’m feeding into my own delusional thoughts. I keep trying to justify it by saying reasons for all that stuff such as saying that because I dated EX in middle school that it’s not a real relationship. I genuinely hate myself and I’m trying so hard to move on even with the guilt. If I tell her it would ruin our relationship and then I’d have nobody.

I'm a trans girl (aged 23) and I've had dysphoria for as long as I can remember.

From being a very young child, I've had dysphoria. I always wanted to be a girl and that pain ate up my childhood. I feel like I've been in mental pain all my life.

When I became a teenager, I hated how my body was changing, and I wanted to kill myself. I was so envious of how other girls just got to grow breasts naturally and didn't have to deal with the hell of thick body hair and voice dropping.

And periods. I know they're not easy but they're kind of a form of sisterhood so I've always felt left out from not getting one.

It’s becoming impossible to survive a breakdown without hurting myself or having fears and urging feelings to end myself. I keep overthinking about what to do, how will it get better if everything is changing and what I thought I was doing right, is wrong. I have PDA, autism, OCD, anxiety 
Growing is hard, living is impossible but I feel so much guilt and manipulation that I HAVE to stay here because how would my family feel? They support me so much but no amount of anything could take away this consistent feeling that treats me like a puppet. I’m trapped on living and dying.

I’m a minor, I want to do so much in my life but everything seems to punish me and it’s killing me. I’ve missed out on so much from myself only, I feel like nothing but a waste only embodying someone corrupted by anxiety and disgusting things that can never go away. I’ve overdosed before, but my body threw up the pills before anything was damaged. 
When I feel I’m better, something happens that I think, and think about that I can’t get reassurance about. I’m all on my own and I only want to be open to my friends which never help me even when I’ve helped them. I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. I wasn’t supposed to exist really.

Is it possible to make it truly look like an accident and does that make it less selfish?,1716011159.0,"I'm a 21-year-old female and I have a lot of mental health issues (depression, anxiety, BPD, OCD, the works). I've wanted to off myself since I was 13 but have always felt like it would be selfish to do to my parents and my sister. For context, my greatest dream in life is to be a mom, and for many reasons I've ruined that chance for myself and also wouldn't trust myself to raise children who could potentially end up just like me. So IMO, there's no reason to stay because I don't want anything else from life than having a family (which I know I can't) and I'm in constant physical and mental pain from sadness and regret from my life choices. I have zero motivation to be here anymore and nothing to look forward to. I can't remember the last time I felt actually happy and it's kind of getting old lol. However, I have a boyfriend of 3 years, a best friend of 9 years, and a family who loves me a lot. I know I would destroy them if I left to escape my own suffering -- like just because I'm f\*cked up doesn't mean they should have to end up f\*cked up too. But I also don't think it's fair that I should have to live with myself for another several decades just to protect them. I've thought about ways I could go to hurt them less (I know that would be difficult but I thought it might be believable if I got into an inherently dangerous hobby ahead of time and had an ""accident"" doing that) but it would still obviously cause them pain regardless.

What’s left?,1716009756.0,"What’s left in this life? I had a love that was my everything. I would die for him. If he needed a heart I would die to give him mine. I have loved this person since the moment I laid eyes on him and always felt like we were meant for each other. We dated throughout high school but I broke up with him before senior year ended. It really was never bad between us… it’s just things happened that was emotionally too hard for us at that age to handle. We kept in touch for awhile but after a year or so we stopped talking. Once I was healed I realized I had messed up but he had moved hours away. I packed my car up and decided I was going to go win him back. I went gassed up and about to get his address when I checked Facebook…. “New relationship status”. My heart shattered. I went home and bawled myself to sleep and cried for at least a month or so… right then and there I promised myself no matter what point in my life I am at if he ever is single again, I will go after him and give it my all.. all of my relationships since him have been me just going through the motions and in some ways losing myself. Not caring who I am with to the point I started being abused. I was in a really low point in my life to the point I didn’t want this life anymore. But I couldn’t do that to him. I’ve stayed here for him, I love him, I want him. While being hit, thrown down, sexually assaulted, yelled at, etc…  I would lay there crying, my thoughts would rush to him and just thinking of him is what kept me here on this earth.. kept me mentally going. One day I was creeping on his mom’s facebook and realized he was now single… in that moment I jumped with joy. I broke up with my current hell of a relationship. I kicked his ass out of my house. I waited a bit and then reached out to him… we have been in contact ever since and to my knowledge it was bliss… he even came and saw me this past weekend and stayed with me. I have loved this person for half of my life. 12 whole years. To me he is the love of my life. I don’t think I will ever love anyone like this ever again. I don’t want to. Tonight he tells me that he doesn’t feel the same way, he hasn’t felt the same way since we started talking a couple months ago… he wanted to wait until we saw each other in person to say anything. Which I understand… I just honestly don’t think I can do this anymore. I don’t believe I can live this life without him. This whole entire time I’ve truly believed we were end game. I just want to end my life right here and now. He’s the only reason I’ve made it this far as it is…. I live by myself and it’s all I can do not to end it right now. Why should I keep going?

Since the start of 2024 I made an effort to get better, a real effort. I started therapy and would consider my relationship with my therapist as good, we have a good understanding of one another but even going through the process I just don't feel like I have made progress, if anything I feel worse. I became more aware of how things **should** be rather than just functioning on my messed up thought process. I made an effort to rethink my reactions but it hasn't worked, I just feel more down and out of the game.

I workout, I eat healthy, I work for myself, I try maintain a network of friends and try do all the right things that people tell you to do but it's all meaningless, it just feels like motions you go through to try experience what ever this thing called life is.

i've never had ambitions. even as a child i knew i was going to die by my hand. my childhood was troubled based on the things i can remember. i would purposely endanger myself because of things at home, which resulted in multiple hospital visits and led me down the road of unusual forms of self harm... along with its ""trendy"" forms (much to my dismay). in the 4th grade i didn't attend school much. i was either hospitalized or at home coping through video games and literature. after those visits my mother would always make sure to berate me for being so fucked. i only attended 33 days of that school year. to this day i do not know how i was let forward a year. 

by middle school i was sexually harassed by my peers because of my (at the time) sexuality. ""i can make you straight"" followed by groping was something i dealt with constantly. i switched schools and one of them had the gall to say sorry AFTER i switched and was let off scott-fucking-free. the school i switched to was fine, but that summer i was groomed for 5 months and i've still never recovered. i'll never forget that he would make me shower on call with him... and i'm still scared of showering to this day. i'm almost an adult and i haven't gotten over something that happened when i was TWELVE. utterly pathetic.

the rest has been a blur to me. its all been shadowed by my groomer and his memory. i always think i should've stayed longer, but i would've most likely ended up dead in a few weeks time. funny because we've started talking again. i KNOW its wrong and i KNOW it has such detrimental effects on my mental and physical health... but no one loves me like he does. he has a job and an actual adult girlfriend and goes to college and it fucks me up. he's so much more put together than me plus i'm making him cheat on his girlfriend just to feel the love that no one around me has given me in so long. i want to spend my last days as a minor with him.

If a failed relationship after 3 months and some suicidal thoughts is all it takes to make me give up, then I do truly deserve to die. Death is the only thing that can free me, I want nothing else than for the pain to end and I feel like suicide is my only option. The world has nothing else to offer me because I won’t accept it. I wish everyone I know could forget about me so I can die and end this waste of a life.

I’m happily tired,1716006331.0,"I’ll be honest in saying that my mental health is probably the best it’s been in years. But then I remember that my darkest days really weren’t that long ago. The things that turned my life around was 1. Literally having to drive to a mandatory lecture while 100% still legally intoxicated after a failed attempt. (Please don’t drink and drive, even if you want to end it. Don’t bring others down with you) 2. Realizing I’m transgender (I’m not here for a debate)

But in those darkest of days, I made a plan. Start to finish. Every little detail is written out. And my method is still stashed away, along with the rest of my “departure luggage” as I call it. I made peace with the fact that I’ll probably be dead by the age of 30, most likely from my own hands. In some strange sense, it’s calming to know I have everything ready for when that decision is made, whenever that is.

Somedays too, even if I’m not feeling down, I just wanna do it. Get it over with. I’m tired of waiting for “the big day”. And to be honest, I’m still tired of life, the same way I was not too long ago, especially as a trans person as of late. I’m not here to hurt people or brainwash them. I just wanna be me. Yet everyone tells me I’m better off dead. Maybe I am. I planned everything anyways so maybe this has been my sign all along I’ve just been ignoring. I’m tired of being political fodder, I’m tired of be a low class working slave to billionaires, I’m tired of waiting for the day that the next war is announced, I’m tired of waiting for the next catastrophic weather event.

I feel like I have no one. Everyone who was close to me has said mean things to other people about me and I feel like no one is on my side or close to me anymore. I’m wrong if I’m happy and I’m wrong if I feel emotions. Everyone always seems mad or disappointed in me. It feels like I’m being thrown around and I don’t know how to make people or myself happy.

For context, im a senior in highschool and about to start college, I’m hoping that once I get away from some of these people, life may get better. 

I have Maladaptive Daydreaming, a severe addiction to daydreaming, where I have a beautiful fantasy world. It’s been vivid in my mind that if I were to die I could live in that world, which scares me by that part alone.

I feel extremely alone and by myself. I’m scared. I know I have my whole life ahead of me, I am just worried about not making it.

I don’t remember the last time I hung out with someone. And it’s not for lack of trying. I tried to be friends with my coworkers, but they didn’t want to hangout with me or be around me. Then I started school and I tried to be friends with my classmates and it was all fine at first and then they stopped talking to me out of nowhere. I sit alone in class, I don’t think half my classmates even know my name. Now, someone I considered a friend came back home from abroad for 6 weeks. I made plans with him and he basically ghosted me. I knew nothing until 10pm that night, when one of his other friends texted me and said he’s “not feeling it tonight”. He’s hanging out with other people, and explicitly not inviting me. And no it’s not paranoia, he actually said “no, you can’t come.” Hes been having parties every weekend since he got here and excluding me. I joined a sports team (that I suck at) and instead of making friends I’m just getting bullied and left out. Again. 

This isn’t the first time this has happened. Growing up I was always the person in class without a partner. I was always the one excluded from camps and parties.

Frustrated that there’s no fix to these feelings,1715998011.0,"When I felt these pullings when I was young, I figured it was because of my shitty situation.  since then, I’ve improved my life in every way and more, but the ironic thing is, now, these pullings are stronger than ever.

I’ve done everything I thought would make my life click in place so I wouldn’t feel like this anymore. At this point, I don’t understand what would work, or if I’m meant to be like this.

Now every time I have thoughts about ending things, my brain like latches onto them and takes them seriously, and I get these intense pulls to do it. I just don’t understand it. I truly don’t want to feel like this, and can definitely say I tried to help myself. 

In order to ease my mind, I’ve decided to do it after I have read every book I’ve ever wanted to. (Gives me an actual “timeline” and also more time to figure more stuff out) (I guess tricking myself into being here longer).

But I persevered and tried to find my people. Too bad, IRL all my friends have ignored me. Mainly because I’ve been around my family more lately and my dad screamed, chased, and terrorized me just for having a panic attack, and they didn’t like the fact that I was trauma dumping about my abuse. I was trying to be vague and not go into detail but they still hate me. Can’t even be abused without people thinking that I’m a burden. I can’t remember the last time I went out and did anything fun. The most fun I’ve had in the past year was going to the Barbie movie. I felt like a normal person with friends that day. My family left for vacation today and I didn’t go because I found out my abusive father was going too. I was under the impression that it was going to be my mom, my aunt, and my grandpa. But then I found out I was going to be stuck in a car, hotel room, AND a train with my dad for 3 days.

If i fail my program..,1715995154.0,"I will have nothing left. I want to be a nurse, and i just finished my first year. Unfortunately i failed a course and was put on academic probation, meaning if fail the reintroductory course next semester so I can retake the failed course, i am kicked out of the program. The teacher who failed me never liked me either and she will most likely be the one grading me again.

I haven't worked in over a year. I was supposed to start a job as a PSW on may 10th, but they rescinded the offer because of the failed course despite me telling them during the interview. I got the offer a week later. That job was my life line. I was going to use it to get the skills experience for school and pay off my debt. My four cards are maxed out. Im 1040$ in overdraft with a daily 5$ fee compounding. My bills are bouncing. I got audited and owe a couple thousand in taxes. 

I have one friend from middle school that is another life line of mine, but she lives 10 hours away, and her life is taking off. I will be left behind i already feel the changes. Im gay and been single pretty much my whole life with the occasional few months fling.

Since I got Covid in 2022, my body hasnt been the same. I deal with daily pain and paresthia in my fingers and joints. I am 25 years old. I feel like im drowning and all my life luck has ran out. I feel like God is laughing at me, but sometimes i think he isnt there at all. 

I take the reintroductory course in October, and I've decided to take many, many short videos to leave my mom between now and october  so she can watch them and and see me everyday if i decide to leave.. 

My mom and little sister are the only reason im still here. Ive never been stable enough to move out of my parents' house. I am in the basement currently crying my eyes out once again. They would notice my eyes if i went upstairs so often i stay in my room until they go to sleep to prevent them seeing me. I know the damage i would cause if i left. They would never recover, but I dont see myself getting out of this one. My program saved me the first time. I cried when i received the offer because i didnt even think i would get in.

My life could get significantly worse by october. Theres always something in my way preventing me from excelling and just having a normal life I desire so much.

I'm not looking for pitty, many of my problems are my own fault. I guess im just here to tell my story idk i think it might be a cry for help but i dont think anyone can help me i haven't felt genuinely happy in over a year. All i know is that ill be completely hopeless and lost if i dont pass that course. I imagined my future as a nurse and i dont see myself doing anything else. It is my only way out of this depression.

I want a fresh start.,1715994665.0,"TW: Alcoholism and Self Harm

I’m 32 M, fresh out of a 5 year abusive relationship, which followed a 7 year abusive relationship.

My family have no respect for me, they talk over my sentences like they don’t give a shit what I have to say. My opinion isn’t worth anything to them, and this has had a lasting impact that makes me feel like my opinion isn’t worth anything to anyone.

I have a career I hate, which I begrudgingly obtained a degree in the subject area for, which took me 8 years studying part time and I “achieved” the lowest possible grade.

I was diagnosed with ADHD and Autism 2 years ago after discovering my parents were advised I may have these conditions when I was 5 years old, but didn’t pursue it because that’s “just nonsense”.

I finally know what I want to do; I want to go and study a MA in Philosophy but my existing degree is not in Philosophy, nor even the arts, so I would have to study a new Bachelor’s to get it - but I can’t afford to do that, and I can’t get another student loan (UK) because I have a degree already. So that’s great.

On top of everything, after the previously mentioned 7 year relationship, I drove myself into £30,000 of debt, which I am desperately trying to get myself out of and still will be for a while. Especially now my most recent partner has left.

The last year of my life with my girlfriend of 5 years have been a nightmare of me hiding more financial stress from her, and using alcohol to deal with the weight of it myself. I’m trying to quit drinking, but as I’m sure some of you will know, it’s easier said than done.

I’m at my wits end and there isn’t many people that can help me, or will even ask me how my day is going. The people I surround myself with just use me, and I’m losing patience. It feels like everyone seems to get what they want and what they deserve, while I’m stuck.

I hadn’t self harmed in a long time, but most recently I’ve cut more times than all other self harm I’ve ever done. Not to end things, but to feel something.

At this rate I feel beyond help, even taking my own life wouldn’t help because I can’t, because I need to make sure my parents are happy and I know I couldn’t do it because of how unhappy they would be. My dog would be sad too.

We started talking, they asked for my snap, sent a photo of themselves and asked me to send one too. It eventually led to them asking if I've ever sent nudes before and I told them I hadn't. So they sent one first, I sent another, and this went on for a couple of photos. Pretty much right afterwards they sent me my following list and the photos of myself that I took and threatened me for money. I unadded and blocked them immediately.

Now brings me on to the second part of the problem. I have a girlfriend. We are both 20 and have been dating for almost 2 years. It took me about 5 days but I eventually told her. Not over the fear of them sending it out but the feelings of disgust and regret I have been feeling this past week. Anyway, I told her, we talked, cried, she said she forgave me but I just don't understand how she can forgive me? If I put myself in her shoes It would take an EXTREME amount energy and trust for me to be able to forgive and love them.

Now brings me to the final part. I feel like trash and I know I should. I can't even imagine wtf my girlfriend is going through right now. She has always had self esteem problems, and most of her exes have cheated on her in the past. What is so different about me that she would want to stay and actually work things out with me? I feel horrible for what I've done and it's been bringing out my suicidal thoughts again. I know I don't want to, but at the same time idfk. Honestly the only thing stopping me is my family and the extra trauma that my girlfriend would be going through if I went through with it. 

I've always felt like cheating ticking time bomb. No matter how good a girl is or was gonna be good for me, I always knew I'd have the urge of what cheating felt like. Now that I've experienced what it's like, I never want to go through this again.

My attempt failed again,1715984135.0,"Long post ahead, I'm sorry. 

A few days ago, I posted that I should kms or I won't get another chance. A little bit to what happened, I had to leave my apartment cause I really can't afford it, being unemployed and a failure who can't find a job. I thought I should kms in the apartment but felt bad because my landlady is a really kind person and I don't want to cause her trouble. I decided that I'll just be a hobo and loiter. 

The movers came and I had prepared my things to be sent to my boyfriend including my phone. I also left my note with my things and scheduled an email should he miss my note. Said my goodbyes to my kind landlady and loiter around the city. 

It's incredibly hot so I had to let the day pass in a park. Feeling tired I decided to take nap that night and thought I'll just commit after a quick rest. Soon after, I got my first hobo treatment, getting doused by a firetruck. I thought I had to do it then but I really got anxious of the people and cars passing by. I don't want to be sent to a hospital when someone saw me bleeding, I can't afford that. I decided to walk and look for a secluded place to commit but it's really hard to find one in the city even in the dead of the night. 

I walk the entire night until the next day letting my feet take me wherever. There are people and dogs everywhere, I really don't like going out and I really thought I would find a place where I won't get people's attention. My feet are sore from all the walking and I started limping. I decided to go to the county side then. I was hesitant to do this because I ran away to the country side before with the same goal in mind and my boyfriend found me somehow. And he found me again, I didn't even notice him until he hugged me. 

I'm disappointed with myself and I really don't know how to feel. I just want to die and not be a burden. We're poor and I don't want them to waste their money on me. I don't believe I'll ever be normal again. I also believe that they'll have a better life without me. My mom is really religious and had people pray for me. I stopped believing in God and I don't know if this is some divine intervention. I feel like shit. I feel like a fraud and an asshole. I still want to die.

Suicidal development,1715983509.0,"Im getting more and more tired of living, i am not even trying anymore, some days I dont even eat. As long as I can think, my life was hell, more or less severe abuse in my childhood i mostly cant even remember anymore, severe depression during school and severe mental illness during my adolescent years.
4 years ago i dropped out of college, because i could not bear it anymore to function under such extreme suffering, but it only became worse after it, i went to a few psychiatries, but not only did it not get better, they couldnt even tell me, what even was wrong with me, year after year, things just became worse, i have always faught, always even loved life in a way, but year after year it only became worse and i grew weaker and weaker, two years ago i was in a toxic, i would even say involuntary relationship in which i was more or less raped and which resulted in me losing most of my friends, because the girl i was with drew all of my friends on her side, even contacted my family, the last year i spend mostly in bed imagining me killing myself and in the last few months i have found peace with letting go of hope, because trying anything except lying in bed just results for me in unbearable pain, i see it day after day, the things i have once cherished and that seemed to be beautiful to me, grow more and more distant, almost out of sight, all people i once loved are not part of my life anymore, my best friend most likely died of an overdose, the girl i loved left me, because she herself had difficulties with her psyche and tried killing herself two times during our relationship, i lost my apartment over a year ago, because the youth welfare office wouldnt cover me anymore due to my age, after that, i was homeless a few months. After that, I went back to my parents with whom i broke off contact before that. And now i just lie in bed everyday and it gets worse and worse by the day, I am suicidal as long as i can remember, but suicide changes its colour more and more, as I have seen my dreams die one after another during the years, even the most basic things like hygiene are slipping away from me by now, a few months ago, it started, i became more and more suicial and at first i was frightened and even admitted myself to a closed psychiatric ward, but it changed, now I see it as a realistic solution to my problems, the doctor there even told me that i rejected any responsibility for my own well being, which i didnt think back then i thought i just felt too bad and was even thrown out of the clinic, because i could barely speak a word or put together a sentence and in every therapy i just started crying uncontrollably or i was shaking. Maybe she is right, but i just dont care enough anymore, i am ashamed, yes, but even that will end. My body also hurts more and more, every movement is painful, not only extremely stressful. I realised, that as more sure i am getting of killing myself, the better i am becoming in a way, i told everything to my mother and she tells me i am weak, cowardly and pathetic for truely considering it, maybe she is right, but she hated me my whole life anyways, so i dont really care, i dont care anymore for such labels, i just dont want to suffer anymore, i have put together a plan and took measures towards it, i am just missing a date and a few letters.
I think to myself that i am just waiting for one better day during which it wouldnt be unbearable to prepare everything i need to off myself and then im gone, just like that.
Suicide seemed always so far from me, even if I always thought of it in a way, I always faught against it, now, nothingness is inviting, i am broken by life, i imagine it like the memories i have of sleeping, simple nothingness, nothing to be afraid of, no pain, no memories to bear, no broken promises or shattered hope, no hate, no more fighting, nothing, the only hope i have left.

Needing advice desperately,1715976543.0,"My fiancée attempted suicide and I’m struggling not to now

Hello, Friday morning my fiancée attempted to end her life with pills. The family won’t tell me anything, and keep screaming it is all my fault.  We had a fight the night before but resolved it and ended the night saying we love each other. She then sent me a message at 4-5 saying she won’t be a burden and she loves me. I wake up usually at 5ish and asked if this was about self harm but when I didn’t get a message I assumed she was asleep. She’s sent messages like that before but this one seemed a bit different. I should have realized and drove to her house instead of work… I’ll never forgive myself for that. 

Since then her parents won’t tell me a word, I even had to call 20ish hospitals to find where she was. When I went there and waited the father screamed at me saying it’s all my fault and to leave. The mom also called me telling me she will kill me.

 My fiancée has tried this before a few years before meeting me as well and has a history of attempts. 

The only thing I know is she’s in the ICU (the hospital just told me that much) and no matter what I do the parents won’t let me see her. I honestly don’t know what to do.  I’ve never been suicidal but I can’t bear getting random photos (from the mom) of the woman I love with tubes coming out of her without any update. I don’t know if it’s normal for a suicide patient to be in the ER and then ICU for over 36 hours. Please if you have any information let me know.

Since it all happened I’ve started drinking, I haven’t eaten and I am thinking about giving everything up.

That no matter what I do, how healthy I eat, how much I exercise, how much I try to maintain my mental wellbeing it will never really make a difference. There’s a lot of sadness from a lot of different places. So many feelings of worthlessness and the fact that I don’t think I’ve really ever felt loved by anyone. Love is supposed to be peaceful and calming and reassuring and ive never really felt that. And maybe theres no other explanation for that other than I am unlovable. I am agitated and irritated. Haunted by things I cannot change; decisions I have made and things that I have said. And as I withered away, no one noticed. I don’t blame anyone, but it does add to my theory that no one really ever cared or loved me back. Everything seemed conditional or temporary. But this is to say that I am tired of running from the things that haunt me.  I am tired of feeling alone. I am tired of the pain that I will never escape. 
 
 
You treated me decent, but in the moments that mattered – the kind of moments that saying or doing the wrong thing can really un-do any acts of love or kindness – you hurt me. What you did or didn’t do sent a clear enough message about how you feel about me. You seemed to have an excuse or explanation for anything you said or did. I tried opening up to you and letting you know when I was suffering. And in turn, you would just make me feel bad for “choosing to focus on it” or “ruin my day by thinking about it”, which somehow sends the message that’s its my fault I feel this way. Maybe you didn’t know how to handle me or maybe you really meant it. I don’t know. I needed a break from it all. Maybe we could have just drove some place, or we could’ve gone to the ballet, or to the ocean, or whatever. Maybe you never suggested any of those things because you didn’t know I was suffering. Or maybe you did know but still chose to sit tight. I don’t know which is worse. This isn’t to say that things were sour all the time. They weren’t, and some of the happiest days of my life are with you. But the sad and bad parts of our life seem to drown those out. Like I said earlier, in the moments that really mattered, you were not there. I am so sorry for the things I said or did that hurt you. I know I am not innocent and this contributes to these feelings of emptiness and self-hatred. I don’t think you truly valued me. I think surface level you did and said that you did, but your actions and some words were so hurtful that I could never believe you really loved or valued me. I hope you are able to pick up the pieces again and continue your life. Take good care of my [Dog’s Name]. I’ll be looking for him wherever I end up.

"Hitting rockbottom again, a cycle of painful memories and hopelessness",1715975968.0,"I don't know why something like this would trigger my painful memories from 4 years back, but here it goes - today I found out that I am going to lose my job (been for 2.5 years) in 2 months. It's definitely my fault, coz the first year I was applauded for excellent performance. Then prev year I started hating the change in my role and everything slipped. 

But Today, this triggered something that happened 4years back - I lost my girlfriend to cancer in 2019 after she battled it for 7 months. I lost my job a month after her death, in exactly the same manner - due to poor performance. I was there for her trying to keep her happy and I would risk losing everything else a hundred times over if that meant to save her. But I lost her and I lost everything but I anticipated my job loss. There was so much guilt and regret that I prepared to end my life. But I didn't have the guts to follow through so instead resorted to self-harm. Went to therapy and got rid of the guilt but not the regret. And honestly I moved on after that, thanks partly to my therapist. 

I tried to have a life, get into a couple of serious relationships but those never worked out because I am pathetic. 

Today, after hearing my lay-off news, everything just hit again - starting with the detailed memory of the previous layoff followed immediately by the memories of her last 7 months. 

About to be 30Y, and I feel such a deep sense of hopelessness and a failed life. The self-hate has peaked so much today that suicidal thoughts did occur momentarily but I was able to resist it. However, there is a good chance that I will give up in the next few months. Life is just unfair.

I despise this time of year,1715974240.0,"Grad season. I’ve been out of high school for about five years now (on the 31st) and I’ve done essentially nothing with my life besides rot on my dad’s couch and internally hope for death. 

I was initially accepted to an art school before I graduated (child me foolishly fantasized about a career in animation), but I dropped out during orientation week because I knew in my gut that I was being scammed, wasn’t near talented enough, and that I was making a massive mistake and was going to be drowning in debt for no benefit later. So, I saved myself from that, but then I became a NEET.

I felt great shame and discomfort over this, and still do. I was briefly living back with my mom after dropping out, and one night she snapped at me, “you’re just a kid on my couch!”. I fled to my dad’s shortly after, and originally wasn’t planning to live here, just visit for a while to buy myself some time and maybe take a gap year or something, but I’ve been stalling and too afraid to return or do anything since, and of course Covid hit and fucked everything up more. I feel paralyzed. 

As I plan to finally move back in with my mom and try to fix my useless life, I once again pass the time of year where I feel bitterness and jealousy toward the successful people earning their degrees. Why can't that be me? Why do they have supportive and gentle parents and I don’t? Why can they navigate life, and I cannot? I feel myself being consumed by rage even though it’s not their fault, it’s mine. 

I have untreated ADHD, panic disorder and on/off depression (thankfully those are treated.. well, enough to get me out of bed), OCD, and god knows what else.

My husband is severely depressed and I don't know what to do,1715969218.0,"TW: self harm, suicidal ideation



My (22X) husband (25FtM) is severely depressed, and just seems to be getting worse. We both have bad ADHD, low needs autism, anxiety, and depression, and we both go to therapy weekly along with taking meds for ADHD. He just got new meds for the depression, but he hasn't taken them yet, since ""it would be weird to start them in the middle of the week."" He also has mild OCD.

He just got a new job at Safeway and managed to get his hours down to 5 hour shifts 4 days a week, but it's still really hard for him to get out the door. He's so stressed that he'll make a mistake and get fired. He doesn't think he'll last even six months working there before they fire him. He's had to call out or leave early a couple times due to the stress and just breaking down. He actually cut himself in the bathroom during one of his shifts. It's healing okay though. I'm so worried that he'll get fired, quit, or try to kill himself.

We're just starting out, and can't afford to lose the income. I'm just starting a job but barely getting 10 hours a week. I really don't want to lose him. I've never loved anyone else, and we're so similar to each other it's scary. I love him so much, and I'm terrified that he'll leave me because of the stress. I'm trying to support him. I'm trying to comfort him and tell him I love him even if he can't love himself. It's really hurting my mental health to see him like this and not know what might push him over the edge. I can't leave him. It would probably kill both of us. Him literally. He says I'm the only good thing he has, and he's the same for me.

He's been depressed since he was a child, on antidepressants since he was like 8, and in and out of mental hospitals until he was about 14. Even as a kid he would try to hurt himself and sometimes others. He says he's never been happy and wouldn't know what it was if it hit him with a brick. I don't know how to help him, and it's so hard to see him like this. He apologizes for every little thing he sees as an inconvenience for me even if he couldn't control it or it wasn't his fault. He only sees the negative and expects everything to turn out bad.

I would truly be lost without him, and I just want him to be happy. I don't know what to do to help him, support him, or make him feel better if that's even possible. I know he's close to ending it, but I don't know how close. He's just so scared and sad, and it's breaking my heart. I don't know what to ask for here, maybe I'm just ranting to let it out. It's just so hard to see him go through this. I can't let him see how much it's affecting me, because he'll just blame himself and feel even worse.

Graduate with your Bachelor’s, get a postgrad degree/grad scheme placement, go for further education or get a job, get a good salary by your mid-late 20s, be in a senior role by 30, get a mortgage, find “the one”, settle down and live your life financially stable with kids and/or pets. Yeah, that’s not going to ever fucking happen for me and the fact that there’s so much pressure to do this all in your 20s is fucking terrifying. 

What’s even worse is that I’m expected to navigate life as someone with a physical disability, multiple mental illnesses, along with being neurodivergent. I can barely leave my house because I deal with agoraphobia caused by years of immense trauma. I can’t live up to the standards set by society no matter how hard I try to fake it. I’ve masked my problems for years and it’s led me to being in this state. 

I’m expected to have it all and navigate life when I already have the cards stacked against me.

I’m sitting here ready to go ,1715967004.0,"I just need to get up off the couch, drive 5 minutes to the gun range, rent a gun and do it.  

I’m boxed into a very tight corner of my own making and I don’t see any other way out.  I have financially ruined my family and they don’t even know yet.   They will once I’m gone and read the note I left.   I’ve taken a few pills to numb my brain and help me push through the resistance.   The only thing giving me pause are my kids.  I know how devastated they are going to be.  I guess I still have a little bit of a heart left.   I just don’t see a way out where I live.   Sure, I could just sit down my wife and in laws and my family and lay it all out as to what I did.  But that is going to only result in everyone coming to the rescue of my wife and kids and I’ll end up kicked out, divorced and it’ll be like I’m dead anyways.   Even if I do die, my in laws and family will certainly swoop in and help them, they have the means.   

Everything I did, I told myself was to help my family get ahead.  In reality when it was really good it was never enough and when it went bad it was just chasing losses.  Now there is nothing left.  Credit cards are all maxed.  Almost no money in the bank.  Several bills unpaid.  And it’s all singularly my fault.  No one else put me up to this, no one told me to do it.   I was looking for a shortcut and honestly I found one at first but didn’t know when to just quit and walk away.   It was always going to just get even better I told myself.   Then came days I would lose $100k in 3 hours.  But that’s ok I’ll make it back on the next and then some.   No.  No you won’t.   

I feel the drugs kicking in and turning the noise down in my brain. No I’m feeling so calm I don’t think it’ll be an issue to go in and pull off my plan.   All the waivers are signed at the gun range.  Just have to pick out what gun I’d like to try and get to it.   

I wish there was another, better way.  But there isn’t.   They will all hate me for what I have done.  But I won’t be here to experience it.  There is no god, no after life.   Just black and then nothing.  Not even consciousness. Then I’ll be put into the ground to eventually turn into oil in a million years for some spaceman’s car.   I hope they just toss my body in a paupers grave and not so much as a marker to say I ever even existed.   I leave here proud of the woman I married and proud of the kids we made.  They are all special and will do amazing things.  With or without me.  ",spokenjeremy,,False,1cub4vi,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cub4vi/im_sitting_here_ready_to_go/

Boredom, rejection, fear, loneliness. My prime day-to-day emotions. Feels like my feet are stuck in concrete and there is a knife slowly approaching my throat, although I don't put in any effort to break myself free.

I want the loneliness to consume me, but I don't want to be taken over by it. I want it to take over and leave no trace of my ego behind.

i need out,1715964488.0,"(TW/CW: SA, CSA, abuse, past attempts)


i want to fucking die. i've tried to before, closest ive came was asphyxiating myself in a psych ward when i was 14. i had the most beautiful, ineffable NDE. other times i tried was taking 60-70+ NSAIs at 12 & forcing myself to keep them all down & not telling anyone for a year. hurt like hell. slitting my throat & needing at least 15 staples. taking 99 600mg gabapentin. trying to hang myself, & more. 

i don't feel safe in my relationship but i have nowhere else to go. my partner is cruel then kind, but it doesn't feel right. he literally raped me a few weeks ago. it took a while before i had the guts to confront him about it, but when i did he laughed in my face & was like ""oh you get raped by everyone you meet, sounds like *you're* the problem"".

not to mention, my biggest trauma is CSA from my dad when i was like a toddler, symptoms started before i was in daycare. i had blocked it out most of my life & my mom always made excuses for my dads creepy behavior, & later on his violence. 

my partner has also gotten violent with me, messed up my teeth, gave me a black eye, tackled me to the ground countless times, kneeled on my stomach while i was pregnant..

we have a 6mo daughter. i want to get her out of this situation but no social services have helped me, & they're scary to call, the other day i was on the phone with one & my partner burst in the door & i hung up immediately & had to lie saying i was on some mental health call (partially true). he called them back, cause he didn't believe me, & thank god the place is now called ""circle"" instead of ""women helping battered women""...

i feel like there's no way out. i have to kill myself. i feel hella guilty but the state will find a better place for my baby than with me. i love her dearly but im too unwell & unfit. she'd do better without having to witness my breakdowns & outbursts...",crypticryptidscrypt,,False,1cua3dv,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cua3dv/i_need_out/

I Think It's Time To Go...,1715959687.0,"This past year has been nothing but L's- frankly, it's been that way for the past 17 years. 

My mother was diagnosed with cancer when I was 6 years old. To create opportunities for me that she couldn't provide, she gave up custody of mend asked her sister's family to raise me in America. I ended up getting abused constantly (in fact, I would get rewarded with a movie night if I didn't cry during beatings). My father nearly killed me twice (once unintentional and once intentional), and the intentional time was for not even a warranted reaction (at least the unintentional one, however an overreaction, you could at least see where he was coming from). 

My father took out $35K+ worth of student loans in my name, even though I never needed it throughout college. Yesterday, I got laid off from my job effective one month. If I can't even hold a job, there's no way I'm going to get into law school or be a lawyer, or frankly even if I switched careers, do anything. As my mother said, ""I'm not good at anything."" 

Because my father believes in merit, he's considering forcing me to pay back the loans that he borrowed. My mother took out $20K of private loans in my name, and it's inevitable based on her business habits that she'll enter a period of struggle, which will impact me. 

I've blown up all of my friendships, mostly not due to my fault, albeit some were. I don't think I'm capable of human interaction. 

I have no friends who care about me, and I've been living with my brother who's a genius and can't relate to me as a person with failings and challenges because he's never failed in his life. When you don't even have the support of your family - in addition to not having no friends and having no capability to have meaningful connections - I think it's time to call it. 

I've tried different things, different ways. The only thing I will not try is therapy: my brother and sister both did therapy and honestly they came out worse. It was all because of our father and how he raised us that will be the root cause of it, so there's no point. 

I actually don't understand why in America, when we're so obsessed with individual freedom and rights, the one thing we don't have a right to is a right to end our own life. We stigmatize suicide so much. We have to make the best decision with the information we have at the time, and I'm convinced now that suicide is the only viable path forward. Does anyone have any thoughts for which method is most like just falling into a deep sleep and never waking up? 

As my father would say, ""if you're not going to do something well, don't do it at all."" Frankly, I haven't been living life well, despite attempts to course correct. So it's time to give up. In the end, I fell short. Choices have consequences, and it's time to accept the consequences for my incompetence.

Suicide,1715956747.0,"
In the shadows of this weary life, 
Where echoes of joy seldom play,
I tread a path of endless strife, 
A soul that's lost, a heart of clay.

Disconnected from the world's embrace, 
I drift alone, a ghost unseen,
No love, no light, no saving grace, 
A faded echo of what has been.

Unworthy of affection's touch, 
A broken spirit, hollow, cold,
The weight of sorrow proves too much, 
In this grey existence, weary, old.

Happiness, a foreign land,
Never glimpsed, nor ever known, 
In sadness' grasp I make my stand, 
A silent cry, a muted moan.

Tired of the ceaseless fight, 
Of living in this endless night, 
I seek a place where pain takes flight, 
And hope dissolves in endless light.

I'm going to lose my job,1715955815.0,"Hi. I won't be too specific for now, but a number of my friends at work have lost their jobs in the last few months.

This isn't abnormal but the reasons stated and talking to the ex employees directly didn't sound like it matched. It sounded very sudden and that's when my worries began.

I started a degree this year having fought so hard to get this job without it about 2 years ago. So I started feeling anxious when my lead/manager couldn't tell me which mistakes I need to fix to not be in the firing line. 

I have to look after my family and myself, but have no plan for when I get fired. I've talked to ""trusted"" people at the office about my mental health and all I got was a date regarding when they will get in touch with me about my employment.

No positive words stick for longer than a day, and even walks or sunsets are failing. I can't process failing myself like this and only realizing too late that my level dropped to mediocrity.

My friends have been trying to be supportive, but after someone close to me got fired, I lost it and haven't recovered since. None of them have been able to raise what I said directly, which makes it worse when I overthink.

I haven't been this far down the hole since 2019. I thought I was okay but I'm going to need help. Please try to help me make the end of the next week.

Another post,1715944836.0,"I use this space to think. Most of my problems, when infused with the right amount of anxiety, become reasons to end my life. I quit my job due to stress, along with general unhappiness with the position, and have been unemployed this past week. I’m 33yo, with a grad in Cybersecurity, previously a software support tech, and now an Uber driver. I plan to move into a families vacant condo for much less money, about $1000 less, Uber, and study for a cert. This will be happening in 2mo, the move is out of state. I tell you this, because there are so many problems that all lead back to ending my life, however, none else more at this point then how long I’ll have to be alone and not try to find someone. I’m ashamed of quitting, and terribly afraid of how difficult it can be to earn money this way. Driving Uber is not easy, and seeing, from time to time, beautiful available women, haunts me. I have the same impression at the gym. I cannot imagine telling a woman I’m dated what I’m going through and up against. This shame is stacked against how I’ve failed to meet anyone for the past few years, while I was employed and feeling okay about things. I’ve started to do some radical things with myself to compensate, some in sad ways. I force myself to eat close to 2lbs of vegetables a day. I’m not fat, and in relatively good shape, but I could stand to lose 30lbs. I also have started to exercise very hard, for multiple hours. I have this delusion that being in incredible good shape would be the answer to finding a catch of a woman. That if I get the fancy job after passing a certification I need, and I’m at 8% body fat, buy bunch of designer clothes, have a swank apartment, hire a professional photography to take photos for me, use those photos on a dating app, then and ONLY then, will I have a shot at finding the woman of my dreams. This plan will take me at least one year, if I can remain disciplined. But I hunger to be with someone so badly now. It’s been like this for such a long time, about 3-4 years, with a few exceptions for flings, but no real connection or relationship. It makes me so terribly sad, worse than what I went through quitting and has seemed to make my entire existence a project for a shot at being happy later on. But for now, I just can’t have that. IM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. And it makes me sick that I know I could figure out a way to defy this truth. The shame I have is so intense and my self-esteem has been crushed. To the extent that even if I found a way to meet someone, I couldn’t handle the immediate pity that woman would feel for me, and how unattractive that is. I’m literally so disgusted that I’ve let this happen and just find that it’s too far gone of a thing to try.

"I'm tired, scared, tomorrow I'm supposed to be thirty.",1715941861.0,"Hi. Tomorrow is my 30th birthday. 

I want to die.

I hear this sentence almost every day since more than a decade now. I've been in institutions dozens of times. I've been through several treatments, and my body has been ruined by SSRIs. I don't know if I'm still suffering from depression. I stopped hurting myself physically a few years ago. I don't know if things are better now. I feel like I have less suffering, but enjoy life less and less. I'm feel like I'm becoming bitter and disappointed in everything, in me, in others,but especially in me. I'm completely dysfunctional, I'm not getting the healthcare I need, I'm unable to go to appointments, I'm unable to think and be productive about anything, even though I have lots of projects. Everything I do feels like a way to procrastinate my suicide, and I generally never finish anything. The only way I manage to clear my head of all this is by sleep deprivation, which I do a lot. After 45 hours without sleep, I just stop thinking, and especially I stop feeling anything, and then I can be a bit more functional. But I do that so often that it's affecting my health. I get very very frequent ""brain zaps"", almost daily, where it's like I get an electric shock through my brain. A few days ago, after 60 hours of sleep deprivation, I stopped seeing colors for a few minutes. Everything was in shades of grey and a bit of purple. Sometimes it's also like all sounds get muted for a few seconds. It feels like someone else is playing with my senses, or what's left of them. I don't feel anything anymore, to a point where I frequently piss (or shit) myself because I don't even feel that it is happening. After 80/90 hours, I usually end up collapsing and sleeping, and when I wake up it's so horrible.

I feel numb, old and ruined. I've had diarrhea for more than a year now, and I don't really know why. I feel like my body is completely unable to feel any kind of pleasure, especially sexual pleasure, and I feel sleepy all the time, except when I stop sleeping for days. It's a powerful drug, but the comedown is hard.

I'm starting to have eczema, and it's growing on my body. At first it was a small zone in my back, and it's getting bigger and bigger. My genitals are literally atrophying from the combination of the absolute lack of sexual sensations and HRT (I'm a trans woman). I should be having regular stimulation to prevent that, but I'm complete unable to. My teeth are in ruins, from lack of brushing, from the stress that made me grind them out for years. I hate my face, I'm completely failing my transition, I hate how I look, and I hate how completely disconnected and isolated from everyone I feel.

I'm getting more and more isolated from my friends. I don't know if they are my friends anymore. They see hi if they see me, but nobody calls. Tomorrow I'll probably spend my 30th birthday alone, if I'm still alive by then.

This is not a new situation, and nothing particularly bad has happened to me recently. But the thoughts have been intense lately. I see myself dead, every bus, every car I see makes me see my dead and cold corpse lying on the pavement, every tree, every hook, every plastic bag, every knife makes me think of how I could use it to die. I'm scared of pain, and I suppose it protects me a bit, but I also love pain, I dream of it, I would want so bad for someone to punch me, to break me, to cut me, to kick me until I die. Usually when I get assaulted it's not even that bad, they grope me, slap me, it hurts for a few days, and the moment is stressful, but it's not intense enough to make me forget about how much I want to die. I was able to reach that kind of intensity years ago, when I was hitting myself and cutting me with the shards of glass embedded in my fists, but unfortunately, or fortunately, I stopped doing that.

I also don't want to hurt anyone. There are already 5 people in my family that committed suicide, I've lost my cousins, my aunts, my uncle, and as a trans girl I hear about sisters dying regularly. My boyfriend is already a widower, his previous girlfriend died a year before we met, losing me would be devastating for him. It scares me.

I said I want to die but I'm not sure it's true. Deep inside me I think I do want to live. There are things I want to do, things I want to feel, moments I want to live. But they all seem so far inaccessible, so far away, I feel tired, and I'm becoming really scared that an impulse is going to end it all.

I don't really know that to do. I don't trust doctors. I'm more scared of my life continuing as it is right now than of accidentally dying because of a suicidal impulse. SSRIs hurt me a lot, I stopped taking them since three years, and now it's becoming clear to me that I suffer from PSSD. Or it's the depression that is continuing ? I don't even know. I just know that I don't trust them, and that I don't want to see more months/years of my life wasted in a psychiatric institution, and more of my body ruined by their medications and everchanging treatments and diagnosis.

I'm scared because all of this has been going on for a while now. I don't know how to fix, or if I know, well I'm unable to. I know my peers won't be that surprised if I end up killing myself. They'll be sad for sure, but not really surprised.

I hope this won't be my last post. I don't know what to do. I wish I could say I was terrified, but not so much.",notanix1312,,False,1cu1wf3,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cu1wf3/im_tired_scared_tomorrow_im_supposed_to_be_thirty/

I'm on a burner account and I'm probably going to delete this account later. I was banned on my other account. A ban that I will take as to be fair I did kind of deserve it.

Essentially what happened is that someone posted a plan to end their own life. I won't go into detail because of their privacy and it just isn't my place but it was a chronic health condition that caused them a lot of agony. It was untreatable from my understanding. People were in support of their decision but I, not really thinking about my actions created a conflict in the comments section over it. 

I was being a stupid little shit, while I won't go into whether I think OP should do it not plain and simple I was being an asshole. I shouldn't have done what I did. I didn't mean to cause harm. I didn't want to hurt anybody involved. But of course I did. I should have kept my mouth shut, and I'm sorry. I apologies sincerely for what I did. I promise it wasn't my intention to hurt or troll anybody or anything of a malicious nature. I was just Benin stupid. And now I regret it. And I feel awful about it.

Out of options,1715944269.0,"I don’t know what to do and I’m afraid.

23F, homeless, no car, no food, no family, no friends, only 10 dollars in bank acc, most likely about to be fired. Staying in motel for a couple of days.

Hi, I don’t know if this the right place to post this. Usually I’d make a throwaway for personal stuff like this but I’m desperate. 
I left an abusive household earlier this year, February 12th. It was my parent’s place. I went to a psych ward for a month, stayed at a motel for awhile. Then stayed with my aunt til I could find a place to go. It was fine for the first few days til the arguments between her and her bf started. Often times it’d get violent between the two and I’d be locked out of the apartment until early mornings of the hour, next day they’re all lovey dovey again.

I’ve been surrounded by domestic abuse my whole life and have been, for the most part, isolated from the rest of the world; so this was normal to me. The problems started happening when they’d directly involve me in it. Trying to get me into their arguments by having me pick a side, choose who to defend, telling me to call the police only to backtrack a minute later telling me not to.
If I had a room it might’ve been ok, but I was in the living room so I’d be caught in the crossfire a lot; since I’d often wake to them arguing and throwing stuff around.

I reached my breaking point yesterday. Another argument, but this time he started going at me. Mind you I said nothing to him and continued not to. But he started hurling out insults, talked about my appearance, my mom, etc etc. I didn’t say anything before, during, or after this and just tried to keep quietly reassuring my aunt it’d be ok and just to ignore him. I wanted to lock him out, since it’s not his place, name isn’t on the lease, not paying rent.
But he took the keys, both to the car and apartment and refused to give them back unless she went back with him. He kept coming in every few minutes to yell at her then goes out to smoke, then back in again. I told her to call the police or I’d call but she kept on saying no, cause she didn’t want to deal with that.

I think at that point I realized this was just a repeat of my childhood. My father would assault and batter my mom, I’d try to defend and comfort her, I’d try to get her help/call the police or family, she’d completely refuse; she’d go back to him, act all in love again, then they’d both be against me. I left my house cause I couldn’t deal with it anymore so to have to jump from one domestic abuse situation to the next is all too much for me.
I especially decided to leave because he went through my stuff. My stuff was moved around when my aunt and I were outside, and it was left in different places. I haven’t been able to find my social security card since, so now I’d need to go through the whole process of getting a new one.

I have no money, no transportation, and no type of support system. Right out of high school I became a full time caregiver for my mother (severe MS, BPD, manic episodes, and depression. Unmedicated for all except MS) along with housekeeping, and helping raise/school my youngest brother (ADHD, also unmedicated).

During these years I wasn’t getting paid for this and I wasn’t working since no one else would be able to take care of my mother if I did; other siblings were children besides my older brother, but he has autism and schizophrenia and struggles keeping up with himself. So the responsibility fell to me.

We couldn’t get state benefits for my mom, dad made too much (200k/yr) so we didn’t qualify. He’s too much of a cheapskate to put some money to the side hire a nurse, or caregiver, let alone pay me. I know he has the money to afford these things but mainly chooses to spend it on lotto tickets, gambling/betting, trips to Vegas, alcohol, expensive shoes, random products advertised to him online, steaks, lobster, etc.
All while complaining that he has no money and we’re draining him. I dont ask for money from him.

He didn’t pay for my rides to the doctors, appointments, or medicine. I had to rely on my older brother or mom to sneak me some money for that. I didn’t have money for basic needs. I wore the same clothes I had in high school; half of which were borrowed from my older brother. Only had one pair of shoes which my aunt bought me, and had to borrow soap and other hygiene products from my brothers and mom since he wouldn’t buy me any. “Oh I forgot” “I don’t have any money on me, ask your brothers” and other excuses like that.

My therapist just keeps telling me to contact dhs, go to a shelter, or stay with a friend or coworker, family even.
DHS never picks up their phone and I have no transportation to get there. There are no available shelters in my area. The ones that are open require either a referral or that I be a domestic abuse victim.
I don’t have any friends (isolated since we moved in 2013) and I’m not close with any coworkers. I’ve only been working a couple months, and for the most part I’m left to work alone, besides customer interaction.

I’ve tried telling her this isn’t a possibility but she just says someone will say yes, “you’re so nice, so someone is bound to” or “if someone else was in your situation you’d help them, so why wouldn’t they?” I’m just at the end of my ropes here. I’m really just posting this just to rant ig. I don’t really have any options left. I’ve struggled with suicidal tendencies since I was 12 and I’ve come to accept life isn’t getting better. I don’t know. I just need some advice or support. Anything I’m so desperate.

I’ve decided that this week is probably going to be my last. My brothers are old enough to not need me around anymore and the rest of my family doesn’t give a damn about me; partially due to burnt bridges during my mom’s manic episodes when she’d harass them. They want nothing to do with us now.
I’m just completely over it now.

Feeling suicidal and rubbish,1715941786.0,"I have recently handed in my notice at work. I'm moving to a competitor. I have struggled with depression for over 15 years, and I always put myself in debt £30,000 - I feel spending money is a solution to cheer me up, which makes the debt worse.. in that debt I tried to set up a business, making custom gifts and such. But it hasn't kicked off and of course this has made it worse.

Anyway, at work started putting stuff onto an account, and recently paid it back. Now I know I did wrong by not telling my boss, but was not intentional of not paying for the items. Just struggled at the time and I had to borrow money to pay that back from my family. But when they approached me, about it. They said it is stealing and they will most likely prosecute. I understand 100% where there coming from, I abused their trust and abuse of power. So I deserve what I get. I said do what they need to do. 

I am one who puts others 1st, I gave money to people who were in trouble, but at least they are okay. Never asked for anything back. But I always seem to want to fix everyone's problems off 1st and I suffer. I think I'm making excuses for my crappy reasoning.

I feel I deserve everything I get. For being an untruthful, deceitful person. Never intended to do what I did. But I have, so no excuse. 

I don't want to leave my family behind, but I think it would be easier to kill myself so they don't have to suffer from my actions. 

I have started to self harm; which when I was at work, I had a pair of scissors in my pocket and quickly tried to use them before going back in. (Dumping rubbish) 

I haven't slept for 1 week and now I keep thinking, just do it and end it. I was driving home and thought I could slam my car into the wall, but I don't want people to deal with the clean up. I think I would like to jump off a cliff or go to a corner where it takes weeks to find me and hopefully no one does.

Why I shouldn't kill myself? Personal view..,1715940822.0,"I want to shoot ten bullets into the head of this depressed person that is me

I'm a failure looking for a reason to stick it out,1715938196.0,"# So sorry to waste your time...

This is gonna be a lot, and you, of course, are not force to read this. I was just looking for something, if anything, regarding an answer to a question I am going to have to face because of my own actions. I understand that if you do choose to read all of this and reply to me, you may wish to berate and insult me. By all means, do so, I deserve it. I don't mean to write a sob story so people will sympathize will me, I don't need people's attention, I'm not coping.

For a bit of context, I am and always have been a burden on myself and those around me. I've been nothing but lazy and useless my entire life. I was the kid that never did his homework, ever. I thought it was stupid and that was my justification to not do it. I was that kind of garbage. I hated when things imposed on my happiness and freedoms, and I resented things that did that to me, like homework. I have always been told that I am full of talent and that I'm so smart or whatever, but it has never translated in my studies. I have always gotten low marks in my courses, always because of homework. If there was a way to flunk out of high school, I would've flunked out a long, long time ago. I'm so pathetic, all I've ever cared about are the things that I enjoy and not the things that are important. 

So like the idiot I am, I chose to go to college knowing the kind of person that I am, telling myself I would change because college is serious and what not. Spoiler alert, I didn't. I'm a piece of garbage and all I've ever done is waste the time and resources of those around me. I'm so fortunate that my parents paid for my college, but they said they would kick me out if I failed and all. I believed in my talents, but not in my work ethic. Sure enough, coming out of my first semester in college, I failed two out of the 5 courses I took and that put me on academic probation. Why did I fail? Well, I failed because of my crappy work ethic. I could've passed these courses with high marks if I had done my homework given that my test scores were always high or solid. As you would expect, my parents wanted to kill me, I was mocked and laughed at by my siblings, and I really didn't have a support system, not that I deserved one. 

Miraculously, I was given a second chance to fix my predicament, and I honestly felt I was doing better. I was struggling to get my work in on time, but I was still making the effort to do it (Nothing to be proud of considering it wasn't on time). This semester, although spent in the comfort of caring friends who wanted nothing but the best for me, was extremely depressing and part of me wants to blame my shortcomings on that. Mentally, this semester was really rough for me and even though nobody knew it, I was going through a really, really hard time. The other part of me knows that blaming my mental health on my shortcomings is nothing but a cop out and I would just be making excuses for myself like I always do. Anyways, looking at my grades coming out of this semester, once again, I have failed two courses, one of which was inevitable, and the other, I am currently fighting for despite grades being posted. I want to really cling to the hope of the mark being changed even though my situation really won't change much, but if it is impossible, then I will give up right there.

  
As you can see given what I have provided above, it should be clear how much of an idiot I am. I have been nothing but a failure, a disgrace, a sloth, and a piece of trash. I have wasted the money of my parents, the energy of everyone who believed in me, and my own time. I should've known I would never amount to anything. If I want to keep living, I'll be homeless and left with only the few thousand I have saved from working my summer job as a lifeguard. I have been nothing but pathetic my entire life, and honestly writing this all out makes me tear up a bit. It kind of hurts that I want to cut my life short not because I hate my life, but because it feels that there is no other options left for me to progress forward. I have given myself nothing to use to go forward because I have been nothing but my own worst enemy. I am lazy and a waste of air. I truly wish to apologize to everyone whoever believed in me, I wish I could man up and just tell it to their faces, but I am too ashamed to even turn off my computer screen and see my reflection. The grades will come in soon, and my family will know, and that will be the end of me. Right now, I plan to run away from home soon and either try and find somewhere to go or just jump off a bridge, I guess (I haven't really thought it out, it's not something I really want to think about).

  
Some of you, who may be nice enough to reach out, may say that my best bet would be to negotiate with my family, or perhaps seek a job in trades, or maybe even consider community college. I can only refute those as my parents are not the negotiable type, even if some of you insist they will be. As for trades, it is something looked down upon by my family, by my friends, and it's rubbed off on me too and I have come to loathe the idea of it. Perhaps it will be my only option, but something I've never wanted for myself was to work day in and day out breaking my back in physical labor like that. As for community college, I would not be opposed to it despite friends and family looking down on it too, but even if that was the route I decided to go down, how would I do that? Once my parents see these pathetic grades, I will be kicked out and maybe even disowned right after I get beaten half to death. Some of you should now be realizing the piece of garbage that I am for saying that, and you have every right to take back any sympathy you may have had for me. I do not deserve any help, any support, and sympathy, or advice. Honestly, I'd rather the option of suicide be validated so I can just get on with it. I think it is finally time to put my pathetic life behind me and release the burden of knowing me off of so many people. All I have ever done is hold myself back and hold others back too. All I've ever done is wish I could be better but then never would I act on it. I wish a work ethic came naturally to me like everything else, because that's the one thing that has kept me from ever succeeding. But because I'm pathetic, I could barely bring myself to succeed at having a good work ethic for more than a week. I hate myself, I truly do. 

Despite how I feel about myself and my life, I do want to clarify that I don't hate my life. I am so grateful and thankful that I have met the people that I have and I am thankful I had parents who were willing to support me. Everyone around me is better than I am and I'm so happy I got to be around such amazing figures, I just wish I could've been like that and committed to that. I'm pathetic, I have no more excuses. But I do have the question that I propose to any who have read this far: Do I stick it out, or do I just end my life already? 

For all who read all of this, I appreciate you more than you will ever come to realize, even if you read it to laugh at me or so that you could have the knowledge of my story to berate me. You guys are everything, and I can only hope the best for you all. Please never end up like me, you're all surely so talented with bright futures ahead of you, I'd hate to see you be like me. Love you all!

Wanting to leave this life. ,1715936962.0,"I’m thinking of trying to take my life three weeks from now. I’m planning to go to the motel I was at when I was sixteen during a time when some really traumatic awful things happened. I know that’s really screwed up. It’s trauma I feel like I haven’t been able to overcome. I’m currently going through a really difficult time in my life which is reminding me of the horrible things that happened during that time. It feels like I’m trapped in the trauma and there is no way out. I battle with long Covid and I have been reinfected a few times now. I’ve been trying everything in my power to avoid reinfection but I haven’t been able to. Each reinfection has set me back a lot. It feels like it’s keeping me stuck underwater. Covid and Long Covid with what it’s done have been incredibly awful and scary at times. Sometimes it feels like something is attacking my whole body. I feel like it’s slowly taking my ability to live and have any hope away from me. I started to get better before but then I got infected again which set me back a lot and I’ve just recently been reinfected for another time. It’s bringing me back to when I was 16 in that awful traumatic situation because for a time I couldn’t escape the situation, I was trapped. I feel like I can’t escape this. I feel trapped. I keep having dreams about that time and feeling like I’m reliving it. I don’t know what to do anymore to stop this nightmare except take my life. All these years I only wanted to overcome my trauma and be able to live a good and fulfilling life. I wanted to make up for the years I felt like I lost to trauma. I got sober almost eight years ago and committed to not give up no matter what and do whatever it took to build a good life. I feel like it’s becoming impossible and I’ve failed. I’m planning on going to this motel taking benzos, opiates and alcohol and ending my life. I don’t think I can do it anymore and I’m losing any hope for a future.

I just feel like I need to be put down, put out of my misery but I need it to be an act of God or a freak accident or an unfortunate illness that I succumb to! I need a solution. 

I wish I could just stop caring and just do it 
OR
that something else does it for me 
OR
that I can figure out a way to ask for help without also being deeply ashamed and feeling like a burden or feeling like I’m being dramatic and feeling hopeless that talking about it won’t really change anything and I’ll always feel this way until I just end it all. 

It just sucks all around cause I don’t want to bring this shit up to my family and I also physically cannot tell a stranger/therapist and I don’t have the time to build a relationship with a therapist because I’m too tired of it all and I just want life to be over with already

need to die but i’m trying so hard.,1715930102.0,"(if you’re religious you won’t want to read this) I hate life. It is pointless. There are many beautiful enjoyable things in life, but the sacrifice is so much. And yes I know we make our own purpose in life, but I just can’t seem to find a reason to have any purpose because of how short and pointless everything is. Lots of people, the majority it seems, are motivated by the goal of doing enough to be remembered. Yet, humans are such a tiny part of the universe. No matter how hard we all try to avoid and ignore the fact that we have only been here a short amount of time, we will at some point no matter how hard we try all die out and nothing we did will be remembered (maybe not but that is so far from likely is is nearly inconceivable) But why is that such an important motivation to so many? We are so insignificant it’s hilarious, yet because of many religious beliefs people think they truly are amazing and special and have some magic person watching over their every move. I wish I could believe that. I believe there could be many things we don’t understand, but that’s the point is we don’t know anything. Jesus was most likely just some schizophrenic having religious delusions(not saying he was, it just coincides very well with what we know about him). And I’m happy for the people that are able to have that as a huge relief on their back and not have to think about not knowing anything. It just sucks how so many people find relief in things that I cannot. The only reason I have been keeping myself alive is to try and enjoy what little things there are and mainly so I don’t negatively impact the people in my life.

Idk why I’m here ,1715929676.0,For years I used to bitch and complain to social media that I wanted to die when in reality I just wanted all of the pain in my life to go away. Now years later I guess I’ve mostly adjusted to the pain. I don’t want to go to in depth but now I think I’ve reached the point of being better off yk dead. Mostly numb to the pain of life and it makes me feel even more useless. Who adjusts to having no one ? To not being a father. Who even sits here and allows their kids lives to continue on without them and I think the best thing that I could do is stay away at this point. Am I to get my shit together and somehow fuck it up again just to pop in and out of their life and fuck them up somehow. I guess I’m just saying that I think now I’m actually going to do it. I’ve not the supplies or the means to this exact moment. But I believe that I just made my decision and I guess I just needed somewhere to type it out. This post makes me sound like a POS but I’d like to say I feel like I’ve done everything within my power to be as good of a person as I’m capable of even down to the point of not doing this until I knew there was no one left who cared. Anyway I know you’ll all say nice things and tell me not to and carry on with your lives hoping it stopped me and who knows maybe someone will.

Called Suicide Hotline Like an Idiot,1715928925.0,"I went searching online for reviews/experiences of people calling, I wasn’t able to find much. I called, and boy do I regret it. I wouldn’t have began to spill my heart out if I had known better. Undergoing so much psychological warfare, I can’t even begin.

Two years ago I drove me and my sister from Atlanta to North Carolina to see my Father, his new wife and her children. My sister’s twin brother was supposed to come with us. He didn’t show up, wasn’t answering the phone, so we left after waiting a few hours for him. He called once we were on the road to say he had fell asleep (the Mother of his children told us he actually saw us calling and decided to ignore it). Once we arrived in NC, he called my Dad to tell him he was on his way with his kids. My brother ends up getting a flat tire in nowhere man’s land SC. My Father was cooking Thanksgiving dinner, his wife had been drinking, and I knew that meant I had to go help him. He was two hours away (mind you, I just finished a five hour journey). My sister came with me, which was helpful as I needed her to stay in the car with the children while I taught my brother how to change his tire. I was so upset do discover he had customized rims and after working for about 30mins I was not going to get that spare on. We were there for five hours. Had to leave the car, pack everyone in mine, and drive two hours back to my Father’s. When we got back, everyone had eaten and the tree was being put up. It completely broke my heart. I guess I’n an old soul because I would’ve made everyone wait until we got back. My mind as an elder would have been “They’re not eating, we’re not eating. We will all eat together today, no matter what, we’re a family.” 

The next day my Father drove my brother and his children to the car, whilst I drove my sister and I back to Atlanta. She picks a fight with me just as we enter SC and jumps out of my car while driving. She calls our Mother, our Mother calls our Father, who then calls me to say “Baby, I know I haven’t been the best Father but how I just heard your Mother speaking about you, I’m not comfortable with you going back into her home.” I then am told a friend is going to drive five hours to come and get my sister. I stay nearby a gas station until she is picked up, I wasn’t leaving my sister in a town she didn’t know in South Carolina. My Mother informs me I am not allowed back home. My Father believed the way I showed up for the family triggered my Mother and Sister.

Fast forward two years later. My Mother, Sister, and I are living together again in aims of internationally healing. My Sister drops my Mom off at the airport and calls me to vent as my Mom was so upset, she slammed the car door and refused to hug, kiss, and pray with my Sister (we always pray before flights). My sister gets T-Boned coming out of the Airport with me on the phone, I began praying immediately - shouting the protecting Blood of Jesus over her. I jump in my car and drive to the airport.

Fast forward the next day, my Mom made breakfast (she got off the plane before takeoff the night before) and my Mother puts alcohol in my drink (I have been sober for nearly two years). I am furious, as I believe she is mentally spiraling and tried to get me to relapse. My anger alone scared the living daylights out of my Mother and she tells my sister to call the police. They come, but my Mother had put on a nice pair of clothes, she did her hair, and walked out the door. I speak to them, tell them exactly what I believe is the root dysfunctional cause. They tell me this is indeed a Modern day poisoning but I am forced to leave and live in my car. Thanksgiving comes and I get a flat tire. Twenty minutes away and they couldn’t return the favor.

I am stuck in this part of the story. I had a really great job that I couldn’t keep up with because of the stress. My coworkers started treating me differently and it’s my fault. I let my boss and a selective few in on what was happening for two reasons: 1). To build community 2). Accountability. I hit pedal to the metal hard; gym, ionic foot detoxes, talk therapy. They were astonished to see how I responded to such calamity, but I have been in this ring with my family before and I wasn’t losing this round. What I didn’t expect was for those selective few co-workers to kick me down. I lost the round and the job after that. I couldn’t handle the triggers of being picked on and bullied, which they were aware I do not affiliate with people or environments as such. HR does an investigation and I come to work environment worse than the playground. Between battling them and my family, I broke down.

I’m living the life my enemies built for me. The Devil is real, he knows my name, and he’s aware of how many souls I have the capacity to save.

Please pray for me that this psychological warfare I am under does not win. We are not alone. We must fight back. Please let me hold  your hand through the darkest hour, as I invite you to hold mine.

I love you very much.

Each new day, I would revert back to my old self, forgetting the promises I made to myself. It seemed pointless–those who were unkind and “cool” were still adored by everyone else. But I began to realize that I wasn’t the same person, and my attempts at being mean and “cool” were not well-received.

Tonight, as summer break begins and I finally get a chance to rest, I want to strive to become a better version of myself. But the question that keeps nagging at me is, how do I make this change and stick to the promises I make to myself without falling back into old, toxic habits?

Does anyone have any advice or resources that could help me on this journey?",Lariixd5683,,False,1ctxgdi,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1ctxgdi/im_an_asshole/

Considering MAID,1715919241.0,"Well guess here's a good a place as any. I'm seriously considering MAID and have already filled out the form. I need a witness to co-sign for me but well, my parents certainly won't and I have no friends in town, and the ones I do have are very far away and wouldn't agree with my decision. I tried for a decade, the whole bit: medication, life style changes, an ESA, a solid psychologist, things did get better I'll admit but it's not enough. I'm still in the pit. And I just hit the decade milestone of this mental and physical hell. Just because I'm further from the bottom then I used to be doesn't really make a huge difference if I still can't fathom being out of it. I had three meltdowns this year already and have already self-harmed pretty badly. I'm very good at hitting the right places so that nobody can see any of the cuts, contusions or bruises. I refuse to be institutionalized, I'm only a danger to myself as I would never want to hurt anyone beyond the pain my death would logically cause some ppl and being drugged up in a facility would only solidify the prison my body already is. Once I'm dead though it's not like I'll have the capacity to feel guilt or know what others are going through, so knowing some people would be sad about my death is not a huge deterrent.I'm on the spectrum, late diagnosis but it certainly explains the severe bullying over my life and not understanding much of why so many people are complacent or apathetic of the world to the degree that change is rather improbable at any reasonable pace. I hate this place, there is good in the world but the time and effort it's going to take collectively to fix the myriad of issues on this planet, I just don't think it's going to happen in my lifetime.   
  
Personally my life is average, I'm working poor and I know that I could be happy with a small place to live and my dog, but my dog will die in a few years (he's old) and having a decent place to live is not something attainable realistically with my disability and class. I can't wait on a miracle and my parents can't help as they are poor too, I live with them. My dad's a textbook narcissist and my mum is an equally mentally ill enabler who takes her frustration with her regrets on life out on me. She said if she knew I would be born with my conditions, she wouldn't have had children. My body always has problems, and it will only continue to degrade with age as I've been informed by my GP and psych. I have several chronic issues that flare with stress so I'm in near constant pain and can't eat much. I'm sick but not sick enough for doctors to actually help me when there's ppl with cancer or other more debilitating diseases to manage. They don't care about my quality of life as long as I'm sucking air, which is par for the course with my experiences with the medical community. 

Why say all this? Well just wanted to give some background to understand my hopelessness, I'm not charming enough to get enough ppl together for collective change to actually improve my and the ppl around me's lives, my support system has been reduced to my psych (my dog and mum have decided they don't want my company anymore but well who can blame them, I'm so miserable!) and said psych has said the only solution to my mental health is to be kind to myself the last three sessions I’ve had with him. How can I be kind to this animal, this body I hate so much that I've been forced to take care of for so long. I can't maintain a level of health long enough to have a regular job or tolerate most conditions of 9-5's without severe mental and physical consequences due to the strain on my disabled ass. I'm skilled at art so I've been scraping by with freelancing on my own hours, tried so much to get regular contract or studio work but I've been rejected from over 367 jobs, starts to really feel like you're useless and unemployable after you get into the hundreds. Now freelancing has become impossible for me, I just,,I can't do it anymore. The one thing I still liked doing has lost its lustre and the pay is not worth the pain anymore. That combined with the crumbling of my support system and the work it's gonna take to rebuild anything, I'm just too tired. 

So, anyone wanna co-sign a disabled chronically depressed flesh bag cursed with consciousness and give them a peaceful gov-assisted death? Perhaps advice? My parents are away this upcoming week and I'm extremely tempted to go freeze to death in the mountains. I'm close and it would be a peaceful death comparatively.

Everything was great I worked 4 hours after school was trying to get my license and had A’s  in class I was working 16 hour days in total 7 days a week to make sure this chick had everything she wanted. She cheated. I went into a full depressive state until I just turned 18. I met a few girls here and there every single time they said they would be serious and exclusive they all cheated all 5 of them. I went to trade school to become a welder I had to live at the school with other people no biggy the staff were extremely racist to two guys I met in there and myself while we were just laying in our bunks the staff told us to go back to our hood like we weren’t respectful ass people I got kicked out for reporting it “causing drama” the other two got kicked out as well for no reason at all. This morning before I went to work I went through my girlfriend’s phone and found multiple back shot videos of her with someone that wears a ring.

My mom passed when i was 15 and i’m turning 23 this year. Life has felt so pointless since she left. I’ve been in the hospital multiple times for suicide attempts since then. 

I have friends though. I have a good job. I have a nice apartment. I see my sister and nephews multiple times a week. My mind is just so exhausting and i fantasize about being dead every day. 

I’ve tried so many different medications and have had so many therapists. When I’m doing good, I’m doing amazing, but when I’m doing bad it gets so so bad. 

I lost my best friend about 3 years ago (she didn’t die, we’re just not friends anymore) and i think about her every day. She has me blocked on everything and will probably never speak to me again. 

There’s also a guy i used to talk to but he refuses to speak to me bc a lot happened between us. He’s the best guy I’ve ever met and known. I don’t think I’ll ever meet another guy like him. 

And then there’s my ex… she abused me physically and mentally for 2 years but I can’t stop hate watching her social media. She got a new gf and constantly posts her, like things she would never post with me. I don’t know if I’m jealous, miss her, or just hurt that she’s treating her new gf better than she ever treated me. Or all 3. Why does she look like she’s living her best life while I’m at home crying all day and wishing I was dead? 

I’ve also gained like 30 pounds in the last 6 months…. I hate my body every day. I used to be so skinny and had a flat stomach and now I look huge and disgusting. I can’t even look in the mirror anymore. None of my clothes fit me anymore

Things to do before suicide?,1716399394.0,"20M.

I'm going to kill myself, I don't need to be talked out of it or any sort of help. No one can help me.

I'm currently a student on the other side of the world, and I plan to kill myself here (hopefully within
the next ~30 days).

Suicide method, still undecided. Probably by jumping from my balcony (15th floor) or another high place. I have no fear of heights, have bungee jumped 700ft, jumping won't be an issue.

I was wondering if anyone has suggestions for some thoughtful things I can do to minimise the impact of this on my family.

I plan to pack up all my things, and have the apartment clean and empty, so that no one needs to do that.  I will leave funds for the repatriation of my body back to my home country, and funeral.

Just wondering what else I can do. I don't want my family to be worrying about me being missing if I decide to commit somewhere other than my apartment. So I'm considering a scheduled text.

Anyway, any suggestions appreciated. Thanks.

Please don't tell me not to kill myself. That's not the point of this post. I'm more than aware of what I'm going to do. My lack of emotion should say enough. Just let me know some things I can do.

How do I actually reach out for help?,1716398132.0,"How do I actually reach out for help? Better yet, why would I reach out for help? I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for a long time, and I've even tried asking for help about it. Hotlines were totally useless. Nobody in my life seemed to actually care afterwards (did i reach out wrong?). But what are they going to do anyways? I don't have insurance for therapy, or any money really, so they can't really get me any help.

 I've been able to keep myself alive, even after a couple impulsive attempts that, in retrospect, had no real chance of doing anything. But I've found my thoughts wandering into creating an actual suicide plan that will definitely work. People say suicide is selfish, that I should reach out and ask my friends and family for help. But I think mindlessly reaching out like that is the truly selfish act. There is nothing they could actually do to help me. By reaching out I would be forcing upon them the reality that they weren't able to do enough to help me. I don't want anyone to think this was their fault because I reached out and they couldn't do anything about it. The way i see it, if I truly care about my loved ones I should dissappear as quietly as possible. But obviously everyone else thinks differently.

I had so much love when I was first born but I ruined it. My mom think I’m gonna start summer school online soon cause I missed half of 9th grade but I would actually rather die. 
   I’m gonna take a bunch of pills and fall asleep. If I wake up, I’ll do it again until it finally works. I don’t care where I end up after death even if it’s just nothing cause at least then I won’t feel anything anymore or be awake to feel it. I worry about my dog the most but I’m not her favorite person so she’ll be ok and get over it. I don’t plan on leaving a note cause i don’t want to give an explanation I just want people to get over it and know that there’s nothing they could’ve done. My mind is addicted to sadness and flourishes in suicidal thoughts and it will be like that forever. I already know ow my fate so I’d rather die young than die couch hopping in my 20s from something I should’ve done much earlier.

What should I do??,1716397188.0,"It's probably a really stupid question, I'll probably end up looking back on this and feeling dumber than ever for even asking.

My wife has struggled with her mental health her whole life, she suffers from multiple disorders and conditions that influence her mental health. It's a lot for her, I know it's a tough fight for her and I'm doing everything I can to help her work through this but there's been a lot going on in our lives and I feel like it's starting to be way too much for her, I'm sure I've messed up a few times too and that doesn't help her case at all but I'm doing my best. Earlier this morning before posting this she had a meltdown and started looking through the house, she wouldn't say what for but I have a gut feeling she was looking for something to hurt herself with because it's happened before.

I went to go intervene and I held her for a while until she calmed down, I saw some scratches on her arms from where she'd been scratching herself, I didn't think too much of it at the moment because she was at risk of doing much much worse, I waited for her to calm down and got her arms and everything cleaned up, she said she was hungry and I figured maybe it'd help her feel a little better atleast, went to get her something to eat and came back to another meltdown. She ended up breaking a mirror, it's not the first time it's happened but it isn't a big deal, she ended up messing up her hand pretty badly, I got her cleaned up again, I wrapped up both hands incase she hit something else, and covered up the rest of the mirrors so she could be more comfortable.

I got her to calm down and eat, she fell asleep shortly after, I went to go clean up the glass from the mirror now that I had a chance, when I was done I found her sitting on the side of the bed crying, she had a pocket knife in her hand, I'm assuming she hid it somewhere or I missed it because I'd taken and put everything up a few weeks ago since she'd been having a lot more difficulty handling her emotions even with help, I know its not easy, I tried everything I could to calm her down again, it wasn't working at all and she basically stated she wanted to hurt herself, I asked her to put it down or give it to me, she said no, and I ended up having to restrain her and take it from her because she wouldn't give up the knife and obviously I don't want her to do anything, I look back on that now and I could've probably been more subtle about it instead of full on restraining her but in the heat of the moment I wanted her to be safe and she was clearly not going to give it up. I feel bad for not taking a less extreme route but it was scary.

I feel bad for this too, I tried to comfort her to the best of my ability, this is probably really wrong, but I didn't know what else to do, feel free to criticize me for it or whatever, I know it's probably the last thing I should've done. I took one of her meds she takes to help her anxiety, she takes two different doses of it depending on the situation. She takes hydroxyzine, one is 10mg and the other is 25mg. Her doctor said she can take two 25mg for when her anxiety is causing her to panic as long as the first dose is proving to be unhelpful or if its an emergency, I forced her to take one 25mg tablet and waited a while, it didn't do much and she was making comments like *""I'm sorry"", ""Make it stop"", ""I don't want to keep doing this""*, just a lot.

She doesn't have anything to apologize for, I know she's just having a rough time and it's not her fault, but when she poses a threat to herself or anyone else I feel like I don't have a choice but to do whatever I can to prevent it, I waited a bit longer and she wasn't any more calm then than she was before I gave it to her, she started making suicidal comments so I gave her one more and left it at that, I don't know much about this medication and I don't want to push it any further than what I know I can do to try and keep her from hurting herself. I waited for a while and she's calmed down a lot more, I gave her some things to make her more comfortable and maybe help soothe her, like some soft blankets and some extra pillows and plushies since those tend to comfort her. She's watching TV at the moment of posting this, still on edge, I'm sitting with her to make sure she's okay, and I'm trying to help keep her comfortable until I can figure out what to do. I asked if she wants to talk about what happened, if she knows or has an idea on what pushed her to that point, she said she doesn't know and she just wants to relax right now so I'm not asking any further questions until she's ready to talk.


Before anyone tells me I should've taken her to the hospital to begin with, I haven't for a few reasons even if they do seem stupid


First, I'm aware she easily gets homesick and being away from home for any reason can worsen this an million times over, and I'm trying to prevent it from worsening especially now that she's making these comments about suicide and hurting herself. I'm trying to keep her comfortable so she could have less of a chance of doing anything.

Second, she has separation anxiety that can also make it worse, and chances are I might not be able to stay with her very long if she's admitted, and she could start to panic again, and again I'm scared she could try to hurt herself if she spirals like this again.

Third, this probably sounds like the stupidest thing ever, but she's currently undergoing chemotherapy and I'm not sure if she can still receive it if she's on a psychiatric hold. She's really strict with her treatments and she hates the idea of missing one for any reason, which also worries me.

*With the amount of stress it could put on her, I'm overall trying to see if there's another way to go about it, but if there's nothing else I will take her to the hospital.* 

Fourth, also probably sounds dumb, but it could just be something temporary and she just needs some time to relax, but again because of how much worse it could make things I'm trying to see if she can work this out safely before I jump to hospitalization


I feel like a horrible husband for not taking her to the hospital, or not handling things better, but I'm doing my best and that's all I can do. I'm trying to make it *less* of a stressful situation and more convenient for her, as long as she's safe and if she can work through it, I'll do whatever I can to help and try to avoid that extra stress. I repeat myself a lot I just can't say it enough I feel like. I love her to death and beyond that and I really want the best for her, I'm just a little lost right now and I know I'm not a good husband for her but I'm trying, I just need some help to figure out what's best. I'm worried that I can't trust her when she says she doesn't really feel suicidal, because she's said that before and ended up in the hospital due to an attempt the day after. I know that alone should be a big pointer to take her to the hospital anyways but I'm worried she could be mad at me too and stop talking about things when she needs to. I'm scared and I don't know what to do, I'm trying to play it cool for now and just be there for her. Does anyone have an idea what I should do?? Feel free to criticize me if I'm doing anything wrong, I know I probably am and I'd prefer to take that criticism and grow from it so I know what I can do to do better.

Feeling suicidal after breakup,1716394469.0,"So…  my (M34) girlfriend (F24) of 4 years broke up with me 2 months ago. We lived together for 3 of those years. Our relationship was a rollercoaster with lots of big fights. I was a huge asshole sometimes, and she wasn't any better. It was pretty toxic, but we also had so many good moments—traveling, hiking, fishing, you name it. I always thought we could make it work because I love her. I thought she loved me too.

Since the breakup, I've been thinking about suicide every day. Everything I do feels empty, like I'm just going through the physical motions. Things I used to enjoy brings me no joy. She hasn't fully moved out yet (it’s hard to find an affordable place in our city and she is on the lease), so her stuff is still in our apartment, and she drops our dog off a few mornings a week. We see each other almost daily, which makes it so much harder.

We moved to a new city for her to go to college about 8 months ago. I encouraged her to apply, since she seemed so unhappy with her job. She was depressed because of it. I helped her so much. Encouraged her. She really likes it here. She has made a lot of good friends. Change cities, make friends, break up with boyfriend who supported her when she was depressed. Pretty classic... 

I don't know anyone here. I'm also in college (better late than never, right?), taking two bachelor's degrees at the same time (one in a city 50 minutes away and one online). It’s tough, but I kept going for our future. Now, I don’t know how to keep going. I can’t see a future anymore.

Today something happened. She stopped by and left her phone on the table, and a message came through and the screen lit up. The background image was some guy in a navy uniform. Lol. Turns out she’s already met someone else. She met him after like a month, tops. I completely broke down. 

Now I’m 35, no kids (I thought we’d have kids), living in a city where I know no one. She’s with someone else. I can’t afford this apartment on my own, and I’m broke. I’m really stressed from school. 4 exams next week (Great timing!). I can’t concentrate on school work. My old friends live in a city 4 hours away (not like I could talk to them about this anyway). I feel like an empty shell. Nothing I do brings me joy. I feel pathetic for reacting like this. Not very manly, right? I feel bad because much of this was my fault. She has lot's of new friends, a new boyfriend and she says she will sell our (technically her) dog. Great. 

I honestly feel suicidal. I have guns. I don’t think I really want to kill myself, but I don’t know how to keep living either. All I think about is shooting myself, and it feels relaxing. I don't know what to do.

just wanted to share a method to avoid self harm that actually has worked for me,1716392804.0,"so i’m someone who struggled with these urges for 10 years and honestly nothing helps. waiting just makes the feeling get stronger, i can’t distract myself no matter what i do. my motive is mainly that it gives me a distraction from the pain im feeling inside. my therapist gave me a tip recently and it’s a LIFE SAVER. DO A WALL SIT. not a full blown workout, not anything that’s gonna actually injure you, but just a wall sit, or a plank. i promise you you’ll feel something. it burns, it gives you something to focus on, and you can do it as long as you need till the feeling passes.

i’ve also found health shots work too, like those disgusting tumeric and ginger shots. it shocks your system and gives you something else to think about, plus it’s healthy. this doesn’t always work for me bc the feeling will come back a lot, which is why i like the wall sits and planks, i can do them as often and for as long as i need.

i hope this helps someone else, if anyone wants to share anything that’s worked for them too they can :) we’re all in this together, and if you can’t stay clean for yourself (i know i certainly can’t) stay clean bc it’s summer. stay clean bc you wanna wear that cute sundress or you wanna wear swim trunks at the beach without worry. any reason to stay clean is a good reason. if you’re 1 day clean, i’m proud of you. if you’re 1 hour clean, i’m proud of you. if you’re 30 minutes clean i’m so fucking proud of you.",anxiousalbinorhino,,False,1cy3gou,6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cy3gou/just_wanted_to_share_a_method_to_avoid_self_harm/
Life on a Thread,1716392613.0,"I’m not certain if I have it in me to continue living life, my life has been looking like a byproduct of what someone who is suicidal and likelihood of survival was slim. I feel as though my life is the display of what someone who has a low expectancy of survival from suicide risk and survived looks like. It is chaotic and erratic.

Life’s not looking so good right now. I’m beginning to isolate and not have the energy/strength to carry out certain everyday activities.

I can’t cope with all this physical and emotional pain on a daily basis anymore, nor with the psychological disturbance. It’s maddening. So is all this heartache that I have experienced. So many people that meant the whole world to me had left without any closure. Just completely ghosted and abandoned. It leads me to believe there is something wrong with me and I am the problem, that I need to be eliminated. 

I have a lot of regrets and mistakes I’ve made from my life. The one that’s unclear to me is reaching out for help from others. It would almost always push people away. Maybe if I hadn’t reach out for help, these people would still be around today. That is why I am willing to risk my life and not reach out for help most times when I am feeling this way now. I do reach out for help sometimes, but it’s significantly less.

About suiciding...,1716392513.0,"Hi.

The current state of my life right now is probably on the lowest peak and it's so bad I genuinely want to suicide today (but maybe I won't just yet...)

If you're curious: I have very few friends (and I don't talk much with them), I'm struggling with school, my family is mad at me... Anyhow.

So the problem is not suicide, but rather what my family will feel. I'm the youngest of 3 (me: 15M, 31M, 25F) and I feel like even though my mom and sister are so mad at me they will at least feel something. They have caused me to cry hard many times when they were mad (usually after I've done something wrong and I start crying because I feel like shit for it - and they say I cry only to make them feel sad or whatever), but I just don't want them to feel too bad for it. I just want to leave and have them forget me or whatever.

Also, most of the time I don't fully want to suicide for some reason but I feel like it's the best way out. I'm not looking for advice though so keep your mouth shut.

I'll keep an eye on this post. Nothing else to say. And...

Should I kill myself?,1716391915.0,"
I’m 25 year old male, struggled off and on with addiction to alcohol and occasionally pornography. I have a wife and 2 kids, age 4 and 1. 

A couple years ago my wife’s step dad killed her 12 yo brother and her mom before killing himself. Without getting into details I feel like it’s mostly my fault and that I could’ve stopped it. I have gone through several bouts of depression where it seems like I don’t care about anything around me because I’m worthless and the recent one I relapsed and started drinking and watching pornography. I told my wife this after she suspected something was off, and how I’d been feeling and she (normally the very nicest person and never has a mean word to say) said I should fuck myself and that I’m the most selfish person she’s ever met. 

I have a $2 million life insurance policy that will still pay on the event of a suicide. I’m wondering if in this case maybe I should just do it and leave the inheritance to my family to find a worthwhile person to fill my void once they realize it’s better without the cancer that is me being around to ruin shit.

I just want to talk a bit about it cause really it’s heavy on me cause man I had enough ( BTW I’m from an European country so ) 

 I’v been harassed by every one from middle school until high school and then I joined the army because I wanted thought my life could get better and that I would be better as a man but no , was harassed for 5 years straight with no friends untill I left , despite being good in sport and trying to be a good soldier it wasn’t enought to earn anyone respect 

I don’t get along with my family also for a lot of reason , being beaten a lot when I was a kid and being mixed in all the grown up problem is mostly why I hate them 

And the girl now , I am ugly as fuck I look like an Arab Mr bean ( every one told me that since middle school and even in the army so I can’t deny it ) and I have deviated septum ( the cherry on top ) so obviously it’s a big no for most of them no matter how I act the way I look will always come out first 

Now the GF I had ( only 2 ) cheat on me so yeah nothing more to say 

What else , I can’t smile anymore and I’ve developed social anxiety to a point that I struggle breathing in the street among other human ( even small children …) 

I could go on and on but that would be pointless, I was managing to contain it until I recently started a school to become flight attendant, as a just left the army I thought I could be more sure of myself but no I can clearly see I don’t fit in and clearly I’m done 

I am too much of a coward to kill myself but I planing to join the Ukrainian legion to fight and why not die in the front since I have military experience at least it would better than laying dead on my bed

Boyfriend is struggling and I don't know what to do...,1716391275.0,"CW: SH, SUICIDE, DEEP DEPRESSION

The title is the basis of it all but, basically my(F23) boyfriend(25) is showing signs of suicide and I feel like I am scrambling to help.

He has a history of sh and of depression and has relapsed into it pretty hard. He's been saying things like 'I'm in so much pain', 'my heart hurts so bad', 'I don't want to be here', and 'I need it to go away I can't live like this every day'.

He has been sh himself again, although he hasn't directly told me, I accidently found his blade while looking for something else and he has fresh cuts in areas he has sh before.

In the past, before i met him, he had been to a hospital for an overnight stay and said it was awful. He's currently seeing a therapist (biweekly, I think). He had to stop taking meds about 1.5 months ago and hasn't been able to get back on it since. But from where I sit, it just seems like it's getting worse and worse each day. And I don't know what to do anymore.

Personally, I've fought through depression, sh, suicudal thoughts, and have been to a therapist in the past myself. But obviously, my experience is not close to or comparable to his.

I've tried to sit down and ask him if he wants to talk about it, but he just says no, and it stops there. I've asked if there's anything I can do, and he says he doesn't know, and again, it stops there. I'm there with him and want to help but just don't know how. I don't know what to do to assist in his recovery or to help him towards feeling even a little better. 

I'm sorry for the long post, and I wouldn't have come here if I didn't feel like I was at such a loss of what to do. Please, if anyone has any suggestions or helpful tips please please please send them. I'm terrified of losing him and not sure I can bear it myself.

But it's never enough. People have slowly been telling me they dont want me to reach out to them anymore. That I need to be responsible for myself and stop putting it on other people. 

Ive attempted twice this year. My most recent one, I didn't even bother telling anyone about. My husband knows, cuz he found me and called paramedics. My ex knows because he had to come take the kids, legally. And my neighbor knows because she was home when the ambulance took me away. 

But I dont talk about it with anyone. I don't tell anyone when the thoughts are there anymore. I'm tired of the blame, the shame, the guilt. I'm tired of being responsible for making everyone else feel better because they're afraid of me feeling so bad. I'm tired of no one understanding. I'm tired of being pushed away. I'm tired of people saying they'll be there and then blaming me and running away.

But I'm still questioning myself. Did these people know what I did? Could they relate? Were they younger or older? Do they still remember me? Was it just a normal day for them, filled with jokes, or was that call serious for them? Did they have to intubate? What was the procedure?

I've had these questions for years, but ignored them. But now I've been voluntarily working at the red cross and it all just came back. What if they transported me? What if I work with the people who basically saved my life?

I don't know, I doubt I ever will. Not even the address in my medical file gives me any clue. I doubt I can just go somewhere and ask but also: isn't it my own medical file? Don't I have the right to know?

Dont know what to do.,1716384991.0,"
I’m a 40 something year old married father of two. I’m completely broke and $40,000 in credit card debt. I have a job, own a house, but my credit cards are maxed out, all my money right now is going to my mortgage and the necessities. My wife makes pretty good money but it’s under the table and she is just scraping by as well. I feel like a complete failure because I cannot provide the life she deserves. I tried to get a HELOC to pay off these debts because I have a lot of equity in my home, but it wasn’t approved because of my debt to income ratio and the fact that taxes show my wife doesn’t make that much. That really messed me up because inreally thought that would be approved. Then I thought about filing for bankruptcy but that might put my wife in jeopardy with tax evasion. I even googled if I committed suicide would my family get my life insurance money, but they would be still stuck with my debts apparently. I just can’t go on like this. I love nothing more than my family but it might be better for them if I had an “accident” and died. It’s just terrible that my life outside of these finances is perfect. My sons are healthy, smart and handsome. My wife is beautiful and supportive, but I am such a failure and I feel like a don’t deserve them anymore. I don’t even know why I am posting this.

Matured in my depression,1716382525.0,"Recently I’ve been doing some growing up. Life comes at you fast. One day your a kid loving life and the next you’re faced with all of these problems that most of your peers probably arnt thinking of. Tbh I think having children is a bigger choice then what a lot of people think. The genetic game of a species is to reproduce as much as possible and hope that the best and brightest will survive thus furthering the species. It doesn’t care if some die it’s just throwing darts at a dart board. 
So when my parents had me, they based it off their feelings. My mom wanted my dad because he was funny and ignored that he was an abusive psychopath. And my dad wanted my mom because she probably seemed easy to manipulate. 
If there are any ladies here, don’t ever marry a dude who says he loves you so much and will give you the world yadda yadda. Don’t be stupid. He’s just saying anything to get with you, it’s manipulation. 
And I’m the result of that fucked up relationship. A neurotic depressed manipulative creep. Im abusive, mean, manipulative, controlling. The world has hurt me very much, it’s tested me and sometimes I think our society is saying “look, we’ll give you a path so you can live a normal life, but honestly it would probably just be better for the both of us if you just killed yoursef.” Well I’m coming close to doing that. I haven’t felt this way before, most of the time when I’m suicidal it’s a rage of anguish. But now it’s like a sense of acceptance. Like yeah life is more shitty than what I thought, it’s not fair, people are assholes and you’re a loser. There’s a way out and it’s on you to make that call, you have freedom all you have to do is jump. 

I’m pretty sure I’m going to kill myself.  At some point. I mean I have dreams of driving sleek sports cars in Miami and overall being a total G. But we’ll see, I have an appreciation for all the cool things you can do in life. But the day to day is such a grind.

At the Verge of losing it - Parents Depressed and ran away.,1716368659.0,"Hi Guys,

I have been having thoughts about ending this misery for a while now. My dad has been an alcoholic and into gambling for many years, he had taken several loans over the years, he sold our house and lost 19 lakhs we got from it. We have been living on rent and with the current situation in hand, the total loan amount sums up to 25+ lakhs, out of which I have something 6 lakhs of my debt caused by my father.

He is a heart patient and has 5 stents in him, no insurance, no emergency fund, no gold, no assets. I wanted to restart my life and help my father however with the days going every day, I am unable to meet the EMIs and have to deal with so many debt collection agents and people constantly reaching out to me for money. I was planning to save for my future marriage and a house but now that is all drained since I won't be able to recover from this anytime soon. On top of this, my father couldn't take it anymore and he and mom sort of ran away leaving me behind because they couldn't handle the pressure. I know where they are now, but they are too depressed right now. I am alone in this rented house with people coming daily to collect their money. I have spent endless days trying to find a part-time job or freelancing but nothing so far.

List of things I have on my mind right

25+ lakhs worth of debt

My parent's health condition

My savings and plans for my future

My education (I haven't completed my bachelor's, currently in 3rd sem. My father couldn't afford education after 10th and I have been paying my fees since then along with working on the side)

I plan on ending it but I’m having second thoughts.,1716367951.0,"Hello reader. Before I continue I should let you know that this will be long and will go over suicide and suicidal thoughts. 
I’m a 16 y/o sophomore African American male  that attends a small high school in Iowa. An important factor about my life is that I’ve dealt with suicidal thoughts and depression since 7th grade. I’ve always been viewed as strong or athletic for my age but also threatening and a danger. And with knowing that I’ve tried to be the most respectful person I can be. I don’t have a criminal history; I’m always respectful to peers and teachers, and I try to help people when needed . Being a biggish black guy in a 98% white school, it was bound for me to get some bullying; but add some social awkwardness  and I was a prime suspect.



 I moved back to Iowa from Oregon after a year which I guess made me forget how racist this town was. This year was the worst my mental health has been. I’ve had suicidal thoughts and depression in my past but I didn’t and still haven’t spoken to anyone about it. I knew how depression was more like an attention grabber and fashion statement than a mental condition. I was called a monkey, hard r, and more during my school year. I was cheated on and I quit the football team because of racism within my own team. All of these plus the issues at home I had to deal with took its toll on me.



 This also affected my attendance in my second semester of school which affected my grades. I am now failing all of my classes and don’t know what to do. I really do think this could’ve all been avoided if I had someone that could stand with me. Like during football when I quit because the white people on the team were saying racist stuff everyday; the 3 other black people on the team didn’t say anything. My own cousin on the team just told me that I should just come back. This feels like the only way out. But I keep on thinking about the only reason that I’m still breathing; my little brother. I don’t want him to grow in the same situation I was in alone. I feel selfish every time I think of kms because he’ll still be left alone. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve set the date to this Saturday. I’ve picked out my best clothes and plan to finish the rest of my notes before then. I know that I’m probably going to be making a mistake if I do go through with it but it feels like the right and only thing to do.

TL;DR: I’m tired, lost, depressed , and want to kms but don’t want to leave my brother.",ButBongo,,False,1cxvm0w,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cxvm0w/i_plan_on_ending_it_but_im_having_second_thoughts/

Roommate Situation ,1716367374.0,"My roommate attempted to commit suicide while I was at work today. I found them when I got home uninjured and extremely drunk, with the apartment practically torn apart (table and chairs flipped, broken glasses and dishes everywhere, and a suicide note in the debris). They didn't answer any of my questions about what happened and might not even remember given the degree of alcohol intoxication involved. Despite their protests that they didn't need medical help, I called a hotline for a police wellness check and the cops escorted him out for a psych evaluation at a hospital where he should be for a few days.

I've never seen any hints of something like this before. Anybody with any sort of experience with something like this, do you have advice on how to proceed? 

I'm also nervous for his return because I'm worried he'll be angry at me for my call resulting in him being taken to a hospital after he explicitly told me he didn't need medical help. Also kinda nervous he'll try again. What can I do to prepare for his return?",Pavlostani,,False,1cxvhkf,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cxvhkf/roommate_situation/
My Suicide Note,1716367108.0,"I wasn’t sure how to start this, or if it was even worth writing at all. I wanted the people who still cared about me to know why I chose to end my life, although I am sure no one would agree with my decision.   
  
I never had self-confidence. Growing up, kids (and adults) would always make fun of how short I was, even though it wasn’t something I could control.   
  
This sentiment has followed me throughout my life. Men would tell me they would date me if I was taller. Strangers would come up to me and question how old I was because of how short I was. Friends' families would comment about how their 9 year old child was taller than me. I started to think I was hideous, a monster. I avoided all mirrors and pictures because I felt disfigured.  My first “boyfriend” in Japan echoed the same hurtful statement. He treated me very poorly but because I had no self worth and thought this was the best I could get, I let him. I let him control what I wore, how I looked, where I went and how I spent my day. I let him tell me he would rather be with someone else while in bed with me. I let him pressure me into doing things I did not want to do because I did not want to lose him. I thought that if I just gave him everything he wanted, he would love me but it didn’t matter what I did, he didn’t. I ended up losing myself instead.  
  
After that experience, I vowed to not date again. I came to terms with the fact that I was simply unlovable – deformed, undesirable, unwanted.   
  
I accepted my fate, got a Job in Perth and lived my life. For the most part, I was content but I still longed to be hugged and loved by someone. I then met someone very kind and thoughtful. He accepted me despite how short I was and wanted to be with me. Our relationship was very peaceful but I felt like I didn’t love him, and he felt the same. When I chose to end our relationship, I did not realise it would shake my world so deeply and permanently.   
  
It was the first time I felt like killing myself. It wasn’t because I loved him so deeply, it was because I felt like no one would ever love me, heck my boyfriend of 2 years didnt. I felt broken, worthless, not good enough. I hated myself. I felt like I ruined everything. I felt empty.   


I hated that I had to rely on my friends very heavily at that time because I worried that with every vent, they would grow resentful of me and want to leave me.   
  
I felt stuck in my head, unable to function. I was in so much pain. My mind was killing me. I felt like I was a prisoner in my own body. I tied my sense of worth to that relationship, so without him, I felt like I had nothing to live for. I felt no joy in anything. People would tell me it was normal to feel that way – but I questioned whether it really was “normal” to browse the internet for hours on end to find a way to die so I wouldn’t be in the pain I was anymore.   
  
The hatred I felt for myself grew very deep. I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t strong enough to deal with what happened to me. People go through breakups all the time, people get made fun of all the time, people get sad all the time, why couldn’t I deal with it? Why wasn’t I strong enough? What was wrong with me? Surely, I am just a defected good. Surely, I don’t belong here.   
Surely, I wasn’t wired correctly.   
  
A few months later, I went on a dating site and found someone else. He was very handsome and affectionate. I couldn’t believe someone like him would want to be with me. I questioned his motives constantly and although he did things that upset me, I chose to ignore them because I wanted to be with him so I didn’t have to be alone with my thoughts anymore.   
  
And for awhile, it worked. I didn’t feel like I wanted to die anymore. I felt joy in things again. I picked up my old hobbies. I cooked. I hung out with my friends. I felt happy. I was happy. But then the relationship broke down and I ended it.   
  
Again, feelings of unworthiness and pain dawned on me again. I was familiar with these feelings when I ended my other relationship, but I realised I never dealt with them, I just found someone else to distract myself from feeling those negative feelings again.   
  
But alas, the same feelings came rushing back. Feeling like  I am not good enough, that no one would truly love me, that I was broken, deformed, a parasite. That everyone would be better off without me – after all, all I do is complain to anyone who would listen about my problems, not offering anything positive in return.   
  
Unlike last time, I did not want to go into another relationship and further repeat the cycle I was in. I did not want to hurt anyone else. I did not want to subject my friends to my emotions any longer. I decided enough was enough.   
  
The fact that I am seemingly unable to function without a partner, the fact that I absolutely detest myself, the fact that I truly believe people will be better off without me, is evidence enough that I should not be here.   
  
People say suicide is selfish, a permanent solution to a temporary problem and they may be right. If I stuck this out for longer, would I have stopped feeling this way? I am not sure. How much longer was I supposed to wait?   
  
How much longer do I go before realising the problem isn’t the world, it isn’t the men I dated, its me.   
  
I am the problem.

At first, I was relieved that I kept on failing. The attempts acted as a relief for me because I got addicted to the healing process after.

Few months ago, I attempted to jump off a bridge. It was supposed to be my death. Unfortunately, I couldn't go through it because I got pulled and I didn't had the courage to jump. My family and friends started assisting me and comforting me about how I survived it

The thing is, I don't feel like I survived it. If anything, it just prolongs the pain. Worse, my mental health is worsenning even more.

Instinct telling me i need to die,1716360566.0,"Ok so basically, in 2020 or 21 my mums boyfriend went into cardiac arrest in my arms while we were driving him to the hospital which he died from so it has left ptsd on me since then. Last year i had nonstop anxiety and panic attacks thinking i was going to die everyday.

But now this year it has turned into fearing im dying to wanting to die. My life is fine right now apart from 0 friends or therapy. But everyday my brain tells me i need to die like if its my only function or purpose? I dont want die deep deep down but my brain tells me that i HAVE to. I dont have to but it tells me i must no matter what. This constant overthinking and pressure my own mind tells me has made me lose everything these past months i have lost the will for anything. I dont know why my brain is telling me to commit suicide like its programmed or biological. But i fear for myself and the day the fight in me disappears. I have my mum to keep me safe but this weight on my poor broken heart is too much. Ive tried everything to distract my thoughts but the only thing on my mind 24/7 is the need to die. Like im forced to or else?. i really really dont want to and im really scared. I ended up admitting this to the police last week when i was having these thoughts in public and they found me. I dont know if i can hold out much longer for therapy because they are taking a god damn long time its like they are waiting for me to lose the battle my brain is telling me.

Two years ago I was in management. Now I struggle at a part time cooking job that I had to go back to. I do love where I work now, and it’s probably the best work environment I’ve ever been in don’t get me wrong.

‘My culture’ also makes this worse. Basically I have black parents. African Parents. They don’t give a shit about mental health.

In a few days, I’ll be meeting my boyfriend in person for the first time! The anticipation of finally seeing him face-to-face after over a year of online communication fills me with jubilation, but alongside this joy is a deep-seated, profound anxiety that I can’t seem to shake. :-(
When my boyfriend looks at me, will he still see the girl he fell in love with? The one from the carefully selected pictures… Or will he see what I see when I look in the mirror? It feels like no matter how much effort I put into controlling my eating and exercising, my body never reflects the image I have in my head. Every time I look at myself, all I see is what my parents see in me. I’m too fat, too unattractive. I know I’m already underweight, but it doesn’t feel nor look that way. I am terrified that my boyfriend will notice how wholly corrupt I am. What if he finds me repulsive? He can’t love someone who looks like me, someone who is so far from the ideal: I’m not good enough.
Nothing ever feels authentic. I look at myself and wish I could be someone else, wish I could be a man. I’d be a social pariah if anyone knew… It’s agonizing. All a girl is is merit and looks after all, right? lol
My beloved adores me for who he thinks I am. If he knew the real me, he wouldn’t still love me… wouldn’t still want to be with me. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m abhorrently feminine and can hardly even dream of passing as a man. It’s such a far-fetched dream that it makes me nauseous to ponder in excess.
The excitement I have for meeting my turtledove is overshadowed by apprehension and self-loathing. I don’t know how to reconcile all these parts of myself. I don’t know how to be the person I want to be, the person I need to be, all while holding on to the boy I love. He’s all I’ve got anymore… I’d be nothing without my silly.
I think the only solution from here is to call it quits… I’m a quitter. My sweet boy wouldn’t want me to give up, but I’m so weak and tired and lonely… It’s so hard. It’s so hard to consider that he has other things in his life, that I can’t just cry to him on the phone forever… I’d never fight him over this (nor even bring it up—there’s no argument to be had) as he hasn’t done any wrong.

People always say they are open to venting and even those same people are mentally ill and depressed myself.

People would pry information out of me, trying to get me to vent, and I’d do it, and then they’d get mad at me. They’d get mad at me for being too morbid or too dark.

It’s already bad that I can’t ever vent to my own mother, or really anyone in my family. I feel scared to say my real feelings to my therapist due to me not wanting to get admitted.

Help me get my shit together so it's together ,1716353885.0,"I (m, early twenties) have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a long ass time.

First time I consciously remember having suicidal thoughts was at around 12 years old, back then it was mostly just a thought experiment. Recently (weeks ago) it got really serious and I made a concrete plan of how to do it. I'm in a better headspace now and want to actively get my life back on track, I need help with this.

Why am I struggling with suicidal thoughts?

I got an infection in my ear canal in my late teens. After some visits to the doctor my parents didn't take me seriously anymore so I went to the doctors on my own. They obviously took my infection seriously unfortunately what they were doing didn't really make the infection go away it just moved. When invoices came (Universal healthcare, money is not the issue) my parents poked fun at me for going to doctor alone. At some point when the infection had moved deep into the Sphenoid Sinus (I know this now back then I just pointed at where I located the pain), my doctor didn't take me seriously anymore because he couldn't see any infection and titled me as healed. 

So at that point I'm a teenager with a medical problem without support of my doctor nor my parents, so I did what responsible teenagers do and just used weed to manage the pain. At the time I also got really socially awkward and the more time passed the less realistic it got to tell anyone what had happened to me. At some point (18?) I made a (stupid) promise to myself that I will never tell anyone.

A little more than two years ago it got really dark and I got to a breaking point where I made the decision to start fighting my demons in the gym. At first it worked great my health improved drastically I was basically pain free and after trying some drugs and learning to dance I even finally started to get girls. Problem being that with the new highs came lower lows, I didn't know it could go so low, dangerously low. 

I got scared of girls again, somewhat rightfully so I really couldn't handle the hurt at the time. I also skipped the gym for half a year, which is really really bad for me mentally, my health also got worse over this period. 

End of last year I reached a breaking point again where I again applied a strict prescription of gym. I have been going consistently until now, not really by choice I'm completely non functional without it. I'm in the best shape of my life right now, combined with a low body fat %, because I often skip meals. Recently people seem to find me hot hot, this is new to me, and gives me motivation to get my shit together. I'm getting random compliments from strangers, gay dudes are downright assaulting me and smoking hot girls are suddenly interested.

Other than that I've got nothing going for myself, failing college because I procrastinate. I thought I just don't find it interesting, so I put it on hold to work on something I find interesting (with support of my parents), turns out the chronic infection makes concentrating in general just difficult/ unenjoyable.

Tomorrow take the final step,1716352140.0,"For a long time I was trying to get away from that idea but it's impossible. As the years went by I gained more stability but the urge to commit suicide never went away and I don't think it will go away. Every day I fantasize about taking the final step and I don't think I will ever think otherwise, there is no way I can see life differently; maybe with self-deception until I believe it, but not even like that.

What repeats itself every day and all the things that have happened I feel like they permanently damaged my head and the only reason I cling to life is the mortification it causes me to think that if I commit suicide, the only person who I care too; However, it also saddens me in some way to know that she only continues to cling to life for me when she also wants to die and has less of a solution than I do.

Not seeing a solution makes me lose the only reason that made me want to be here; So, since I can't see his well-being now or in the future, I think that staying alive is just a waste of time. All this is irreparable and stability is of no use to me when the situation remains the same.

I tried before and failed, the next time I want it to be the definitive one (maybe tomorrow), I can't handle the guilt and I can't handle how unbearable life is for me. I feel like I'm in limbo between guilt and taking the final step. I just don't want to make the only person I care about suffer more than already does.

Why shouldn't I end it?,1716351522.0,"I'm 28 yo, I have no friends or SO. I have had 1 friend/situationship 3 years ago, and nothing else in the past 8 years. At that point I had a month long situationship. It was something that wouldn't make an impact on most people lives, just another failed relationship attempt. For me, it was the best month of my life. It was the only time I have ever felt peace in my life. We weren't a great match romantically, but friends wise it just was easy. They then got back with their ex, who hates me. We couldn't hang out anymore. And honestly I felt really guilty being friends knowing that it could cause issues in their relationship at any moment. So I stayed away to not hurt her life. Seems to have worked. They're engaged and she seems to be happy. 

Either way, today, I struggle to sleep, eat, or really do anything. I feel extremely bad for my animals bc they deserve so much more. More play time and attention that I can't provide. Nothing really feels good. Job is fine. Stressful bc I fall behind since I'm always tired and rely on Adderall to do anything productive. My house is a mess, I just can't keep up with it. Usually all of my productive hours hours to catching up with work.

I think I have forgotten how to specialize with people. I'm starting to get scared of having to interact with the world. I always feel like everyone is looking at me or notices me or something. Like I stick out it something. This makes going out feel like a lot. Plus I can't do small talk. Like literally don't understand it. Also don't understand flirting. Don't know how to or how to notice it.

I don't have any hobbies. I really don't have many interests in my life at all. I kinda feel like a life is happening and I'm just here. 

I don't expect to ever have friends. Not really sure how to, since I've barely had any in my life. They have all dumped me for reasons that were never told to me. Clearly I'm fucking something up. 

I can't do dating apps bc I can't take a picture of myself. Never have been able to. I've tried joining stuff but usually just quit/back out due to anxiety. Then I feel like a failure after and it all gets worse.

My therapist has tried so hard. I honestly feel bad for them. Like I can't even count how many different ways or different angles they have taken to tried to help me, but I always have an issue or just make it not work. I swear I have felt them feeling defeated multiple times. It's not obvious, could be in my head, but I definitely wouldn't blame them if it was the case. They are honestly the best thing that I have ever had in my life. But it almost feels pathetic since I have to pay for this person to be in my life. 

Also, this world honestly so fucked. Like idk how people can have any hope in a future. Everything thing is evil or corrupted by evil. We have to work till we die and barely be able to enjoy anything along the way. 

My main issue is my social life. Both romantic and platonic. Both absolutely nothing. I can't comprehend how either would change. Since I'm trans it adds another layer to it in this world. Can't really talk to people. I really have nothing to provide in a relationship. 

Idk why I haven't killed myself. I've gotten very close multiple times. Just hasn't happened yet. Idk if I'm scared or something? Can't explain it, just haven't done it. 

So I just don't see why not. I don't really have anyone looking out for me or anything. Like me family cares but I think they convince themselves that things are better for me. Or they just forget when I'm not around. Idk. 

I can't hear ""it will get better"" or ""there is a plan for you"" or any other bull shit line. I've felt like this for over a decade, I'm still waiting for things to get better since they have only gotten worse.

"If this can help, here are my thoughts",1716348056.0,"Life is shitty a lot of the time. You can put in so much work, ignore so much bullshit and still end up getting kicked down time and time again. Some people live easy, comfortable lives where they barely have to work or give anything of themselves away, while others are given the worst situations to try and survive through. No matter where you are and what cards you are dealt, life will give you challenges to manage and distractions to alter your path. Sometimes in order to continue, we must put down the societal rules, that we must be a certain way, do certain things, look so called ""attractive"". When in reality, what's the point of all of those things? Who really cares if you have a fancy car, or a really cool pair of shoes. Life overall, isn't about any of that, it's about what you make of it. Life will only get as good as you allow it to be. Those people I mentioned, who can be given everything on a silver platter, they might have the wealth and the luxury, but that doesn't mean that they are happy or fulfilled. They too might hate themselves and the lives they live. For those people who's lives consist mostly of surviving day to day and prioritizing their time and energy on basic needs, they can still lead happy lives. Life is what you make of it. Find the simple things that bring you joy. It doesn't have to be career related, or identity related, but simple things that light up your soul. I love the spring breeze expecially if I am in a field or on some kind of hill. I love watching dogs run after sticks, either at a park or by a river. I like sitting in public and watching people go about their days. I wonder about their stories and what brought them there, to this exact moment, where I get to have a peek into the world that is who they are. Life can be magical, but it can also be shitty. Life gives you what it gives you, but you have to decide what you are going with it.",Uniisawesome12,,False,1cxql12,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cxql12/if_this_can_help_here_are_my_thoughts/

I have a friend, my greatest friend who is a beautiful angel and literally one of the best people on this goddamn earth like i cant even begin to tell you how much of a great friend she is and how much she makes my life better. So..she's going through a tough time right now. she struggles with a lot of things in her life, and..has been suicidal for a while. I've tried my best to listen to her and be there for her, and I can tell she really does try. but you know how its like, those thoughts dont go away. recently, she seems to be in an especially bad place.

Two abusive relationships in a row.,1716346948.0,"I was married to a very abusive man. I suffered from vaginismus throughout the marriage in part due to religious beliefs and in part due to the abuse. We never had penetrative intercourse. We would try, but it never worked. After 4.5 years of marriage, he kept threatening to leave me because of it and other reasons. I got curious if my constant fear of him contributed to my inability to relax and let him penetrate me during intercourse. I had been a virgin up until that point. I ended up trying it with someone I was attracted to. He was a divorced single man. My period came that day, so we engaged in foreplay but he did not penetrate me. My husband immediately found out and ended the marriage the same day. We had no closure. I felt I had no one to turn to, and that man was the total opposite of my husband. He was incredibly nice, humble, calm, and funny. I started falling for him, partly because he was so different from my ex husband. I expressed my feelings to him. Initially, he told me that he didn't know if he felt the same and wanted to kiss me to figure out if he did. We did that and more. I continued wanting physical encounters. He agreed to them. We had one more physical encounter, and had trouble but came really close. I became interested in taking the relationship further. He told me he was in no shape to be in a relationship. I was heartbroken, but wanted to continue exploring the foreign world of sex with him, hoping he would be my big cure to vaginismus. So I asked him if he wanted to be friends with benefits, and he agreed. The whole time, he kept priming me to make sure I wouldn't get attached, which was understandable considering we agreed to a FWB situation. However, he kept insinuating that my pussy was one he intended on conquering, which made it sound like he was intent on taking my virginity. We did it one time after that, and he did. I was so happy that my vaginismus was finally cured, and wanted to keep exploring the sex world. He was the obvious go-to in my head. I'd try to meet up again and he'd be cold and distant and dodge the questions. I then started noticing inconsistencies in his stories, and figured out that he was probably married. I confronted him. He denied, giving a sob story that his parents are old and ill and he lives with them. He also said he can't do it with me anymore because he feels nothing for me and isn't cut out for relationships with anyone, but that he's happy to stay friends. He made no sense but I accepted the BS. He continued texting me even though I wanted to start distancing myself from him. A few months later, I accidentally discovered he was secretly vacationing in Turks & Caicos with an awful woman from work I didn't find to be a nice woman at all. I discovered it because I worked at the airline company their vacation was booked through, and saw that they booked this trip while he was still sleeping with me. I confronted him about his lie about not being able to be in a relationship with anyone, and it turned into a huge fight. I had taken a job offer across the country by this point and was leaving in 3 days. We ended up rebuilding a friendship that was an emotional support to both of us. I ended up moving back to my hometown, and discovered that he had been secretly married while sleeping with me and in a full-fledged relationship with this other woman, who had no idea that he was married. I confronted him about it and told him we can't be friends, and he begged me to stay friends and started treating me like royalty after that, being nice, caring and very sweet. Throughout the friendship I had repeatedly expressed how I felt this friendship was unhealthy for me, especially when he'd talk about his awful mistress and the royal treatment he'd give her when she treats others (including me) like garbage, and he'd beg me to stay friends with him despite me expressing how I didn't think it was good for me. About 8 months later, his mistress ended up finding out he was married, and he completely ghosted me after I said some hurtful things to him hinting telling he deserved it. He victimized himself in the whole situation, and discarded me from one minute to the next. I haven't wanted this man in my life for some time, but I still have intense feeling of trauma and pain from every stage of the relationship. I felt that he exploited my feelings to have sex with me, manipulated me into a friendship so that I don’t divulge his dirty little secret and he can keep living his pathetic little life, and then discarded me once his secret was out, after all the horrible things he’d done to me and others.

How do people make it through life without wanting to off themselves?,1716344605.0,"I'm 27 and am having an increasingly difficult time fighting these thoughts off. They have always been there in some shape or form since adolescence, but they are getting worse. 

I feel like I'm watching the prime years of my life go by now with nothing to show for it. I currently am in a dead end job that pays less than 40k a year for skilled work. No OT allowed so that is a hard 40k. I lost my second income at the beginning of the year which would have gotten me to about 47k/year. Not great but better than now. 

I've learned 4 distinct skills so far in life so that I would never be shoehorned into one career, but I have no clue what I'm doing with them all now. I throughly enjoyed one of them, but every job I've ever found that needs that skill expects you to be at their beck and call for your career. No such thing as a schedule in that field. I never found a use for one, and the other one is just OK feeling. I enjoy what I do now but it doesn't pay enough where I live to be independent. Looking around it seems the same story most places as well. 

To compound on those, I don't feel I have in person friends anymore. I have people I do chat with, but they are all spread far and wide now. I think I might have scared off those who are still close by. I had a very bad breakup from a significant LTR a few years back and haven't fully recovered. They said they understand and I want to believe them but I don't hear from them anymore. 

I Can't find a new relationship and don't know what to do about it now. Rejection hurts enough on its own. I haven't tried to initiate anything in about a year. No is in fact not the worst thing that someone can say. Having someone label you as a predator after politely asking them to a dinner date and giving them my number did a toll on that end of things that I haven't been able to shake. I don't want to hurt anyone and it really hurts when people assume that's my purpose. 

Finally, it just seems like life is aging out and watching people leave or die. Obviously I have no control over that, but when it feels like I'm now floating alone in a pool that used to have a medley of people (for lack of a better term), it sucks. 

I'm not at immediate risk of any harm but I can feel myself falling deeper, even with meds and trying to see the bright side of things. I have a 5th skill I'm now learning but half of me thinks there's no point to it because I still won't come out satisfied at the end.

If this is too long, TLDR is I don't get how people want to keep living and trying. Life seems like pain with only small moments of happiness and enjoyment. If only one or two things felt erronious at the moment I don't think I'd feel this way, but my entire life seems to be falling upside down with time.

The Universe Has Answered,1716343080.0,"21 F here and the most ironic thing happened to me today. So I've been struggling with depression and suicidal ideation since middle school but it drastically escalated after getting diagnosed with Bipolar 2 in high school. It's gotten worse every year and I've been in one of the worst slumps of my life the past few months.

I had a plan set up at the end of this month to finally end it all. I was planning to get drunk off of my ass and either jump infront of the train or the fastest car I could find. I was still a little uncertain, however, but the universe answered today. I went outside for the first time in a while and 5 minutes in, I got hit by a car 🙃 Completely unintentional, I just was spaced out and not paying enough attention. It wasn't going nearly fast enough to do much (unfortunately), I got a little shook up and fell back but that was it. However if that's not a sign to go through with it I have no idea what is 🤷‍♀️",Illustrious_Music228,,False,1cxp0wq,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cxp0wq/the_universe_has_answered/

Trying to improve my life feels impossible. I just want to rest,1716342616.0,"I’ve been in the worst depressive episode I’ve ever had for the past 8 or 9 months. Lost my job and all my friends months ago. Could barely get out of bed for months. I had a really shitty childhood. My parents were very neglectful and abusive. They hit me all the time because I couldn’t behave. My mom disowned me when I was 12 and then I had to move with my dad who was arguably worse. He made my teenage years absolute hell. The worst part is cps and mental health professionals were involved in my life and every single one of them fell for my parents manipulation. In fact some therapist made things much worse. I wasn’t even a bad kid. I never snuck out or yelled or hit them back. I wanted to be good. I started working at 16 and never had motivation to go to college until recently. I became so burnt out working dead end jobs so I thought trying to get an education at least would help me feel like I had more purpose. I had/have dreams of becoming an epidemiologist. But I just can’t afford anything. I got into the university i want to go to but I can’t afford to move there. I also can’t afford my current home. I have a month to get out. I’m trying so fucking hard to prove my abusers wrong but I think I’m going to prove them right. My step mom used to love telling me I was going to end up dead in a ditch. Maybe it won’t be in a ditch but I’m probably as young as she thought I’d be. I just wanted to be good. That’s all I’ve ever wanted. I wanted to be good for the world and help and inspire people but it’s too hard. I can’t handle the stress. My poor traumatized mind and body can’t do anything good for the world no matter how bad I want it or how hard I try. I can’t afford it. I can’t navigate how difficult this is. Stupid investors bought all the apartments in the college town and now everyone is just fucked. It’s all so fucked I just want to rest forever now. I want to sink into nothingness. I can’t even help myself I was foolish to ever dream of helping the world. I want to be and school and try to get a job on campus and really start taking better care of myself but it’s so hard.

Lately, I don't know which way to turn or what to even do anymore. I've been trapped in this void that is my own mind for months now, and no matter what I do I can't seem to pull myself out of it. I was going to therapy, and it was helping some, but then my insurance dropped it, so that went out the window, and ever since they dropped it, I've been struggling hard.

I (33F) made my dream come true and now there is no reason to stay alive.,1716338357.0,"I left my hometown 11 years ago, I grew up in a very conservative and boring town and my parents were super strict and protective. I neve made any friends, until I moved by myself to the capital city of my country and started to travel alone. I love traveling, I’m very adventurous and curious but my family never understood this, they are super conformists and they don’t like to leave the house. After a few years living alone, working and taking care of myself, I made my biggest dream come true, I moved to my dream country to study my masters, and had the chance to live in the city of my dreams: Rome. After graduation, I couldn’t find a job and I had no money left, so I had to come back to my hometown. 

I’ve been here for a year, unemployed because I can’t find a job in my country either, and during this time I’ve been diagnosed with severe depression and ADHD. I started therapy and psychiatric treatment and I planned to overdose on benzodiazepines last January, but I got a really nice job opportunity so I decided to give it a chance. I was in the final stages of the hiring process and told a friend about it. He applied and got the job because he has friends in that office. It was my only hope, I lost many opportunities before and after that experience, it wasn’t my fault the projects just failed, and now I have nothing. 

I don’t see myself living 40 years more, I don’t want to have children and no one ever loved me so I won’t get married. I don’t have any dream left, I made my greatest dream come true and lost it. There's nothing else I want to do and I’m also broke. I can’t move out of my hometown again, not without support. I stopped enjoying food and music, I can’t even watch a movie anymore. I’m so bored. I used to be so passionate about life and creative and happy… People used to compliment my glow and nice energy. 

I’m thinking about hanging myself, because I’m sure that if I ingest some pills or poison I’ll throw up, my stomach is very delicate. I’m just afraid that I won’t die and end up with permanent brain damage. 

I am a failure to my parents, they never recognized my successes, they are disappointed that I don’t want children. I was raised to be a wife and a mom and to live next to them my whole life, but I escaped that future. They support my brother, they say he’s the future of the family because he is an engineer and he wants a wife and children, so I don’t have any emotional or financial support.

Well, I’ll start with where I am: Divorced, over my ex, barely see my son, 42, small group of friends, dating a divorced mom. My job is easy but boring. Live alone. Can’t have pets. That sums it up.

Eh, I screwed up pretty bad. I admitted to my gf I snooped on her devices because I thought something was going on. I was wrong. Betrayal trauma is some real shit. She’s giving me one last chance. But it came at a price having to rebuild that trust. She’s the sweetest thing. It hurts knowing what I did. I was married 16 years to a cheater and it warped me. I lost myself. The woman I did this to…I want her to be my wife. 

My son is a good kid. So proud of him. My ex back in 2017 said she needed to leave for family reasons and we had major house repairs needed before we could sell. She left me there. Acting like that was normal. I missed over a year with my son. Contractor was backed up bad. I had my dog at least. And I was still able to take showers even if it was hose water. Lol you learn to take a hose shower in winter in under two minutes. In my down time I had nothing better to do than think about all the red flags my wife ever gave me and dig. Long story short I was shown a picture of her with another guy. Dude snuck his phone in our room.

The home got finished and sold. Moved. Tried fixing the marriage. Stupid mistake. Finally told her I wanted out and we both didn’t handle it like adults. She would joke and swipe men on apps while I was busy getting played by a married woman. How I fell. I’ll tell you folks right now…putting your integrity back together is easier said than done. 

I don’t know why I’m here to experience all of this pain if I’m not strong enough or getting tired. I’m so tired. Don’t get me wrong I’m scared to end it. Life can be awesome and I look at people who have a great career, friends, family, marriage and I’m happy for them. I look at fathers who get to play catch with their son or teach him things, and feel awesome for that guy.

I've hit a dead end,1716335945.0,"Today my husband left me indefinitely to stay at his friend's house. We have such a strong relationship but this last few months it has crumbled to nothing. We have a 3mo infant and we are both out of work and deeply struggling and we can't shoulder each others' stress anymore. This morning he talked vividly about killing himself with his handgun as we argued and I tried to breastfeed our crying son. He refused to go to the hospital. His friend came and got him and they both acted like I was insane for being in hysterics. I don't know if he's ever coming home.

After he left my doctor's office called me and confirmed I have precancerous cells on my cervix. If I have a confirmed diagnosis this will be my second round with cancer. I'm crushed. I had a feeling but I didn't want to be alone for this news. Death feels so imminent .

After I got that news I put my son in the car and left to go get milk. The car broke down a couple miles from home in serious heat. I have no friends or family I can rely on to help me. So I began to walk home with my bags and my screaming/crying/overheating baby. I vomited from the heat and started losing it. My husband refused to come help me and sent his mother instead. She picked me up and, meaning well, tried to speak with me and make sense of what's going on. She insisted my husband loves me. It feels like an empty sentiment. I truly don't understand anymore how he can. I let her take my son for a while because I don't feel like I can even take care of myself right now. 

This is the first time I've vented about our relationship issues outside of our home. I don't tell people when we argue, we agreed airing dirty laundry is disrespectful to our marriage. Well he's doing it now. So I guess I'm here doing this. Is this wrong? Am I insane? It doesn't even feel cathartic. I just want to put this in the world before I delete myself. I desperately wish to be heard and understood by somebody. Even a stranger. Please.

I feel so, so empty, and all I expect is emptiness. I have a horrible history of abuse from family and and past exes, my ability to trust is disintegrated, my self esteem is in the negatives. Every day I look at myself I see a sadder and sadder person. I look at the unbelievably stupid shit I go off about on the internet and I can see how unhinged I am. I don't know how to make or keep friends after what I've seen. I don't know how to look at my husband again. I don't even know why I'm posting here - I don't know how anyone can make me feel better. The only thing that makes me smile is my son but even now I look at him and sob because I feel like such a fucking failure. I know he would be better without me. I feel selfish for wanting to stay in this world just to see his beautiful face.

I didn’t realize how broken I am,1716335140.0,"The first time I held a knife to harm myself was when I was in gradeschool. I was 8 or 9 years old at that time. I was a top performer back then, but during that quarter, I ranked 10th in class from being 5th. I was so afraid to go home and tell my parents about it. After school, no one was home yet. I went to the kitchen, held the knife, stared at it for maybe an hour. I didn’t know what to do back then. I didn’t even know why I thought of that thing as something that could end my suffering. I hugged it and cried. I hated disappointing my parents. I can’t remember what happened next.

I just realized I was already broken by that age, and until now, I keep getting broken as time goes by. I still try to live, try to laugh, try to survive. I always believed that I would see rainbows after the rain.

Now, I’m in my 30s. I still have episodes from time to time. I keep myself busy. But lately, I’ve felt it. Being tired of everything. I’m really exhausted and tired. Last time was one of the worst episodes I’ve had in my entire life. After posting my message here, I stayed away from my phone for a month. I tried so hard to stay alive being alone. I sleep, eat, work, repeat. Like nothing really bad is going on in my head.

Last week, I opened my account and saw a few messages from people on this subreddit. I cried and cried and cried while reading those messages. These past months, I’ve neither been happy nor sad. But I do function like a robot. I still have insomnia, really bad, but you know, I tried living once more.

Now, I am still having these episodes of breaking down again. And looking back, I realized how broken I am as a person, as a human being. And I really feel sad about the idea that I have been depressed ever since I was a kid. I have lots of issues, anxiety.

I “fell inlove” with a guy i met online and he thinks we will meet this year but i will kms in july and idk what to do ,1716330814.0,"I really really like him and it hurts so badly because i know that we will never be together, but i told him that it’s possible that we will meet someday when he started that topic. i lied cuz i didn’t want him to think he’s wasting his time by talking to me and I enjoy talking to him so much he is the only one who makes me happy when im at rock bottom… i like him so much i have feelings for him but i know it’s impossible for me to meet him because of my own issues and the biggest reason is that im extremely insecure about my looks and im really shy, i would fuck up so badly and I can’t allow myself to go through another heartbreak and i just have to die asap because my life is truly hell and the only option i have is death.

I can’t take this pain anymore I can’t stop crying i want to meet him and hug him and be in his arms but its just impossible and every time we talk i feel only worse and i get strong pain in my chest cuz i don’t even know how im gonna tell him on the day that I’ll take my life. he has high hopes for me he thinks that im improving mentally but he doesn’t know how much im actually struggling and how close i am to death. 

I wanna keep talking to him till the day i die because he makes me so excited and happy, but i know deep down that the right thing to do is to distance myself now and make him lose interest slowly until he doesn’t care anymore and just forgets me.. so i could kms without shocking him and making him disappointed and sad but another part of me wants him so bad and i wanna use every second that i can speak with him, i can’t breathe I can’t believe i let myself catch feelings like that knowing that i have no chance and that my life is cut short. Please please wake me up from this nightmare I can’t handle this pain anymore. My chest hurts so fucking much i can’t take it anymore. I want to be with him so badly i want him but I can’t meet him. I want to be with my mom and my cats and dog i love then so much but i just can’t stay alive for the ones that i love and it hurts so badly.

"I feel completely indifferent about all aspects of life, including death.",1716330581.0,"I (m17) haven't done any sort of school work for years. I've refused to maintain any of my already few friendships, and I recently sabotaged one of them just for the hell of it. I willingly put myself in the situation that I'm in right now, and I have precisely 0 motivation to pull myself out of it. The notion of turning my life around and being the best that I can be in all aspects (mentally, academically, physically, emotionally, socially etc) honestly just seems so corny and lame to me. I actually have a much greater fondness for the idea of self-destruction; the idea of just living as carelessly as possible. Whether or not deciding to live like that results in my death is of no concern to me at all. The notion of that makes me happy and excited in a way that no positive/healthy train of thought ever could. Basically, my thoughts and actions regarding my wellbeing are the opposite of what they really should be, but I just couldn't care less. I guess you could say I'm here for a good time, not a long time. At risk of sounding like your typical existential teenager, I don't see what the point of sticking around is, anyway.

Don't even know anymore,1716330274.0,"I have absolutely no idea what to do. I have nobody to rely on. I don't know what to do. I am 19f. My life is a complete shit show. I was bullied not only emotionally but physically throughout my childhood, primarily due to being neurodivergent, though I didn't know that at the time, just thought I was ""weird"" and nobody liked me despite being a kind kid. I was obsesssed with early childhood education, reading books by Maria Montessori and writing teaching philosophy statements at the age of 8. I was paralyzed for about a year at the age of 11 and suffered severe medical trauma in the hospital as well. I felt my autonomy was stripped away from me and various professionals there, looking back, were abusive and negligent. There in the hospital I remember wanting to die for the first time. When I got out, the bullying just got worse because now I had the whole being-in-a-wheelchair-thing going against me too. I ended up doing stupid shit to impress my peers and try to make friends, which just meant that I was constantly getting into trouble as a younger teen, which didn't help my mental health. I tried to kill myself at 13. My mom slapped me in the face while I was bleeding from my wrists and told me I was going to ruin her reputation and that I couldn't go to the hospital. I really needed stitches, I still have very visible scars from that day. She sewed holes in some long sleeved shirts for me to put my thumbs through to hide my arms at school and told me not to tell anyone. Things were never the same between me and my parents. I began at 14 seeking validation from adult men online. It was stupid and reckless, but it helped in the moment. I was kidnapped a week before I was supposed to start high school by a 33 year old man. He drove me to a different state 500 miles away, raped me, and tried to strangle me to death before police came. They treated me like a suspect and handcuffed me and made me sit in a cold car for 3 hours in the middle of the night. There was an amber alert sent out all over. I was put in a psych ward for about a week and then began 9th grade at a new school as ""the girl from the amber alert"" to everyone around me. Everyone was talking about it and asking for specifics and making jokes about what happened to me. It also made me a target for older boys who thought it was evidence that I was easy to manipulate. One of them ended up being the reason I had to leave school a month later. I did online school with my now emotionally abusive parents for several months before starting at a new school. But then, covid shut everything down again, and it was all taken away from me. My mental health was terrible and my parents opted for an unhelpful tough love approach. I became very hypersexual due to my trauma, which ended in me being assaulted more times than one. My parents blamed me and began to resent me, their words not mine. I entered a long term relationship at 16 with a boy I truly loved, we will call him K. K got me pregnant and I wanted to keep it, but my parents forced me to get an abortion with illegal drugs. It was traumatizing and I spiraled. A mentor figure who was a family friend betrayed me horribly. K got me pregnant again. I was on birth control, though everyone believes it was intentional, it was not. My parents said I could either get an abortion or leave home, so I moved out at 17. I got my shit together. For a while, things were good. I got an associates degree incredibly quickly and began a successful career in early childhood education as I had always dreamed. I worked my way up to a lead teacher at 18 and loved it. K and I were so happy. He proposed. The kind of true love most people never get to experience. Most of my peers drifted away during my pregnancy. I didn't care, I had K, my unborn baby, and my job. Then, while in labor, I found out K was cheating on me the entire time. I forgave him and we tried again, though I was postpartum and heartbroken. I stayed home with my newborn son while he worked, or so I thought. Really, he got fired or never went to every job I thought he had. He would drive there and turn his data off so his location was set there all day. He would stage pictures and talk about work. Really he was cheating, doing drugs, and playing video games while I was at home with our baby. His anger issues got worse and he'd get violent but not to the extent that I couldn't justify it to myself. His whole family knew. The cycle of him being caught and apologizing profusely and then doing it again went on for a while before he said that he needed to get out of his house where his cheater DV father was impeding his progress in getting better. I love him. It made sense, his dad was clearly where the behavior stemmed from. I left my housing program to get him out and we all 3 lived in hotels for a few months. I had to sell my body to afford a place for us to live. I was working full time as a lead teacher it just wasn't enough. He still couldn't keep a job but he wasn't lying or cheating. I got us a nice apartment all on my own. Things were good for a while. His anger issues would flair up at times but not as bad, and no lying or infidelity. We had so many heart to hearts. We got married. I did great at my job. He started doordashing for income. Things were going well. Then 6 months into our marriage, about 9 months after we moved out/7 months after we got our apartment, he sprung on me that he wanted a divorce. That was about 7 months ago now. We have been living together and I have been hoping to rebuild. In his vows, he swore so sincerely and in such great heartfelt detail to do better and be better and stand by me. And then he just through it all away. He has been so mean lately. Sometimes things are okay and it's like everything is the same. But he thinks I don't clean enough even though I try and he says I don't support him emotionally even though I really feel like I do. I also pay for everything, I even bought him an 800 dollar PC a couple months ago. I got really sick a month ago. Like vomiting 10+ times a day. I thought I had a stomach bug and didn't have money to go to the doctor over something so trivial that would clear up on its own. I made too much for medicaid but still not a lot. After only 4 days of being gone and feeling like shit, my work fired me. After another week or so of feeling sick and getting so weak I thought I was dying, I went to the hospital. They said all the vomiting had made me very dehydrated and I was lacking in a lot of vitamins. They gave me medicine and an IV. Turns out I'm pregnant and have HG. I'm pretty far along. At first K was supportive but now he acts like I'm trying to ""trap"" him with a baby, which doesn't even make sense. We were having unprotected sex and the only birth control was that I am breastfeeding, which he knew, so it isn't that crazy of an outcome. He has been so cruel and angry, saying terrible things. He threatens to leave when he gets mad so I beg him to stay because he knows I'd be all alone and I love him a lot. He has said some terribly cruel things and it's like every tiny thing I do wrong makes me the villain. Yesterday he blew up on me and it was scary and terrible. Today, I found out the few friends I thought I had hate me. One of them sent me the most cruel message I have ever received completely unprompted. I have no family support, no friends, my husband hates me, and everyone I've ever cared about except my son (who is different because he's too young to understand and he loves everyone and he is also a responsibility) wants nothing to do with me unless they are using me. I am so suicidal. I know a lot of people are suicidal but I am genuinely at a point where I am close to doing something I can't take back. But I can't because of my kids, both the 1 year old and the unborn one. And as much as I know I should be grateful for that, it feels so unfair. I've been having to do things I don't want to for money again. I have another great teaching job lined up but I don't start for at least a month. I feel like I should go to a hospital but I live in a state with a very high child removal rate even in cases of just mental health. I am a great mom, even though my husband and ex friends do not seem to agree. I can't risk having my fitness as a parent called into question over an unrelated mental health issue, especially since K's family and lots of people in my life would love the chance to lie about me to cps, and since I'm not employed right now, it doesn't look great. I don't know what to do. I feel so alone. I'm so so hurt. It feels like everything is falling apart. Not that long ago, I was a lead teacher, a wife, I felt like a respected and respectable person. Now I just feel like my train wreck of a life full of trauma has taunted me with this perfect picket fence life that I worked so hard for just to rip it away from me and leave me a useless unemployed incubator that everyone hates and is only holding on for her kids sake. The only people who talk to me or ""care"" just want to fuck me. Even the people interested in a relationship with me and seem like ""good Christian men"" are still driven by lust even if they disguise it to themselves. I have never felt so hopeless.

"Not everyone deserves unlimited chances for everything, there is a limit to it all and that once you exceed that limit, you get what you asked for and its impossible to forgive yourself.",1716326655.0,"First of all, apologies in advance for the potentially lengthy post. I just have to get this off my chest, also interested to see what other people think.

  
For some context: I am a 17 year old male who has been living with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) my entire life, and have been depressed since I was 9-10, with my depression generally growing worse with each year, the past 6ish months specifically being one of my worst episodes of suicidal thoughts and depression in somewhere close to 3 years, and that time I had attempted to kill myself for the first time through asphyxiation.

I should add on too that despite having ASD for my entire life, I was actually diagnosed with it earlier this year, along with MDD too. (The story as to how I got my diagnosis is an entire other story that I will leave out here but would not mind sharing if anyone asks.)

  
I have been far from a decent person over the past decade or so, with my behaviour and actions being antisocial at best and plain stupid at worst, this includes but is not limited to; being inconsiderate and rude, consistent lying and deception, thievery and even being a bit physically abusive just to name a few. 

From the ages of 8-14. I was an absolute piece of shit, constantly being cold hearted to everyone around me and taking all the compassion that they would give me for granted, and whenever I would get called out for it, I would never take responsibility, trying to shift the blame to someone else. And I would lie over every little thing, every innocuous detail, whatever it was, I would lie about it.

And of course me being a kid at the time and begging enough, I was given multiple chances by friends and family alike. I was let back into my friend groups despite the shitty treatment I gave them, my family continued to take care of me and would not mistreat me (at least in my eyes) although I took all of that for granted, did not learn my lesson and instead just gave them the middle finger.

  
It got so bad to the point where after like 4 years of the cycle repeating, acting like this and being given, from what I can recall, 8 chances to change but not changing. I was pretty much ousted from my family and friends, going on to be treated like an outcast. Having multiple groups of friends in school at the time coming up to me and telling me that they did not want to be my friends anymore and my family going ahead and ignoring me. It was at that point where it all hit me, when I was around 13 years old.

I had already been pretty depressed up to that point, not only because of the backlash I had received from the way I conducted myself but for other reasons too such as unable to meet expectations that my parents and teachers would place on me (I am an Asian kid and come from an Asian household so I was always expected to be more than what I was capable of.) and so being outcasted and treated like a stranger, coupled on with everything else I was going through at the time, caused me to have my worst depressive episode ever. I finally understood that I was a worthless sack of shit, that I bothered and burdened everyone around me for so long, despite being given many chances to change. And for once in my life, I finally took responsibility, I had no one else but myself to blame, it was entirely my fault. 

I had become all alone by 14, shun by everyone around me and it was not like I could complain about everyone ignoring me and no longer wanting to do anything with me because I deserved it frankly for the way I treated people. The self hatred becoming too much and I just wanted to escape so I attempted to kill myself for the first time, ultimately failing though since trying to asphyxiate is insanely painful that my body naturally began struggling to survive.



Since then, I have not really recovered, more so just gotten used to it all, feeling invisible, dealing with the consequences of my actions, my suicidal and depressing thoughts, everything that now its just common occurrence to want to die, with the thoughts even being comforting and relieving at times.

I have tried to change over the past couple of years, even getting into a relationship that lasted for little over a year before we broke up and ended things on good terms. And although I can say that I am a better person that who I was a couple years ago, frankly I was way too late and still feel like the ultimate burden, just absolute dead weight that's for some reason being kept around, I was given the opportunity to change ages ago, multiple times, yet I blew it all away.



That is where it leaves me today, a hinderance who has stayed well past their welcome. A foul person who was unable to change and make it up to everyone in time, despite all the chances that I was given. My decision to not change and to continue with my shitty personality and behaviour causing a flurry of individual consequences, where when piled and stacked upon each other, creates this massive list of consequences that I cant ever make up for. Its as if there was this massive backlog that I just never attended to and now my unwillingness to attend to it is coming to bite me in the back, and honestly, I do not even know why I am still trying in life. I have been given somewhere around 10 chances to change for the better and turn my life around but failed each and every time, wasting away years of my life, harming everyone around me in the process. I can never forgive myself and it does not matter how much I do since the damage has already been done.

And yes, as I mentioned before, I was diagnosed as an autist earlier this year, which would have played a part to this all with varying levels of effect but I hate using that as an excuse, and one reason why I was afraid of receiving the diagnosis. I have lived pretty much my entire life up until this year unaware that I was autistic but even so, I want to take responsibility and not try to dismiss it all as just a part of being autistic.

I really want to kill myself, I in fact really should kill myself for the way I have lived my life up to this point. Its not just the antisocial-ness that eggs me on to kill myself, as I hinted at earlier 5 paragraphs above, there are a lot of other shit that goes on in my life asides from this, this is just one of the big, main reasons out of the multitude of reasons as to why I should kill myself that I wanted to talk about today. And it feels like the list of reasons why I should commit suicide grows in some way with each day that passes by.

  
Once again, apologies for the long post, it turned out to be way longer than what I had expected, but its something that I feel strongly about and wanted to talk about for a while since I really only allow myself to be depressed over things I have control over as I try not to focus on the external factors outside my control too much, and so I tend to be more caught up on and frustrated at things that could have been avoided but wasn't because of me such as this. Thank you for making it this far when you really did not need to, I am glad that I was able to get a chunk of my inner turmoil and conflict out after years of keeping it within. I will try my best to reply and answer any questions.

But last time i was hospitalized it was a really bad experience, i was 14 back then. I couldnt take anything but clothes with me, they had us on a super strict schedule, we'd get basically put in time out if we didnt follow it to the T, all we did was play puzzles and talk about how to stop being suicidal. All just to end up convincing everyone i didnt want to kill myself so i could finally get out and got no actual help in the end (other than being assigned a psychiatrist).

I dont know how different it will be for an adult to get hospitalized, im scared I'll go through the same thing of just trying to convince everyone im not suicidal so i can be let out.

I cant bring myself to do a single thing, i just want someone to help me at least a little bit but im not sure if anyone at the hospital will be able to do that and i really don't know of any other options. fyi: im from texas, ive gotten all my medical help here.

I hate my parents,1716324382.0,"Hi, this is my first post on here, so I have no idea what im doing.

So I'm 17 and an 11th grader in high school and currently failing some of my classes but im trying my best at this moment to get my grades up or even pass my finals at least and honestly, I don't think my parents are helping at all. 

Last night I was chilling on my phone and I was about to play a game with one of my friends (online) before my dad came into the living room and told me to give him my phone so he took it and sat it on the table and asked me about school and am I trying to pass school and doing my homework and I said yes, then he went silent for a few minutes until his wife came out of the bedroom and confronted me on some PE work saying why did I sit out on a few days, I said I wasn't feeling well and started to lash out on me saying when she has bad days, she still does her work blah blah but I was saying to myself we're not the same person you know?? you're a grown-ass adult im pretty sure you can handle whatever's going on with you but this is about me and I feel like they're treating me like some damn robot like I can have my bad days?? because, I'm the type of person when I'm stressed I completely shut down and I get very unmotivated to do anything at all, so that day when I was sitting out in PE, I don't remember a lot but im sure it had to do with my girlfriend and it completely crushed the rest of my day so I couldn't participate, and now they took away my phone kinda I think I still have it for work and for school but not when I'm home. I just hate that they think that taking my phone is gonna do anything, I might be wrong but they are taking my phone away because they're forcing me to make friends which makes me very uncomfortable because I do have friends at school and at work and I guess their problem is that I don't hang out with them, but my dad, he's annoying me at this point, telling me that he hates his wife and how much she bitches and blah blah I'm sick of it like, two reasons why he won't leave is because I guess she can't financially support herself, and because of me going to school here but I've been saying that I can go live with my aunt for my senior year and he can go somewhere else because I'm not living with him, and even tho sometimes I hate my stepmom, I feel bad for her and I wanna tell her that dad's cheating on her but I'll just wait for her to find out because he's cheating.

 All of this shit just gets to a point where I just want to end it all, I'm sick of school, sick of always disappointing people and I'm sick of them, I think at this point I would rather be homeless than keep living here, I'm having thoughts of overdosing because it seems like the easiest way to go out, I might do it tonight but I don't want to leave my girlfriend at all, I love her but I don't know what to do.

I'm all fucked up and I hate feeling like this sorry if this doesn't make sense.

I know, killing yourself over grades does sound far fetched, I know, but when it's amplified, and said that you'll be a failure if you have 2 unsatisfactory grades, then, you feel like everything overwhelms you, and you might feel like you're worthless and are on the edge. At least that's how I'm feeling right now. I've tried hanging myself with the string that is used to close blinds and that didn't work.

I feel so much guilt for not telling them, but I’m scared they’ll think of me less or criticize me, or worse get scared themselves.

enjoying my last 2 months ,1716322079.0,"im 20 F , about to be 21 in about 5 months (about to join the under 21 club) & since the age of 5 ive had ocd. It came in stages , starting when in preschool and calming down for a few weeks until it found something else to obsess over. it took everything away from me but my final straw was when i was 17 and about to do my a levels that the years of constant back and fourth , always having to live like it was life or death caused me to have a break down. 

because of that breakdown everything spiraled and i became practically bed ridden. I couldn't shower myself, i couldn't eat on my own , I couldn't do anything anymore and no amount of therapy or medication could fix it. Due to the stress , or well i assume it was because of the stress my cognitive ability hasnt been the same. My thoughts arent the same , everything has been fucking taken away from me.

After months of sleeping in my own piss because i was afraid of having my calves touch the toilet , having my mother feed me because i was too afriad to touch a fork and scrubbing the skin off my body i finally gave up and made a rather lazy attempt to od

Im grateful for my od though because it made me realize that i didnt want to live this way anymore and i started to expose myself to what i was afraid of.

fast foward a year and a half later. i am able to do things again, some would argue that im basically back to normal but that isnt the case.

it never disappeared, it never left , it took away my second chance and i dont have it in me to do this anymore.

my life is over , it'll always be over. 

no matter how hard i try it'll never work out for me, i wish i died the first time. 

ive made up my mind , i dont want to try anymore , im afraid even writing this because of the thoughts im having about all this. Im sick of it. Ive tried and im fucking done trying.

Suicide feels like the only reasonable option ,1716319995.0,"I was abused growing up, terrified to be in my own home.  Late thirties now and diagnosed with autism during the pandemic.

Now I know that’s not true.  But the awful flip side is that means I can’t change my problems because they come from autism and I will have that for life.

I just can’t picture how to go on knowing I have a disability that makes most people I meet hate me.  And I can’t change it.  I’ll have it for life.

Life's a mess in need of assistance ,1716317683.0,"I posted something like this a few hours ago but none of the text showed up. 

Life has become a trap for me in which there is no way out. Everything is a mess since moving to Glasgow, UK, two years ago and I've had three annus horibilis in a row each getting progressively worse. A fatalism has creeped in which I see no prospect for my future and in my darkest hours feels like I'm in the final moments of my life. By that I'm not necessarily referring to a sudden impulse to kill myself but a dreading that it'll happen in the next year. 

Speaking analogically I feel like I'm in a dump truck about to throw its load away into an abyss. Ive been struggling to get out and now I'm nearing the point of no return. One wrong move sends me into the abyss. 

I doubt I'm an immediate risk of suicide. However the safeguards I have in place are getting worn down. 

The problems started 3 years ago in which shortly after moving into my own apartment and doing some trauma therapy I experienced bullying and discrimination in an environment aimed at myself and others at work. I fought for my part before leaving to Glasgow a year later. 

Once in Glasgow, the trauma of what happened at work started haunting me and I was experiencing some symptoms of PTSD. I found another job in Glasgow but it was incredibly stressful. I have Autism and Dyspraxia diagnosed well also looking into ADHD. The job just put incredible stress and my family who were accommodating me needed money help. Eventually I fully burned myself out and quit because of active suicidal thoughts (this was about 10 months ago). 

While off sick from work, I struggled to do the emotional work to recover because of tension in the household amongst my family. We found a way to deal with the tension but I've not been able to put in the emotional work because I'm deemed to be too volatile though one family member has a history of being emotionally provocative. 

I have debts that are completely ignored. No friends as I struggle making friends. No relationships either. Family is the only support I have but that can get extremely tense. I'm living with my parents at 33. The jobs I can get stress me out so I can't function and I have limited prospects of getting the jobs I could do. 

My life is just a giant mess. When I see hope I feel like I can't trust myself mentally or physically anymore to push through. I struggle acting and have severe procrastination issues from fear of failure, success and perfectionism. I struggle with impulsivity and bad financing though I know how to budget.  

I'm at the point I just see suffering in my life, useless pain. No hope, no prospects and I feel like an abject failure in life as a human being. I've wanted to die for numerous years (around 14) and it's the most efficient option out of the mess I'm in. 

I've increasingly moved from third person views of idealising my suicide to first/third person. The thoughts have been increasingly intense. I'm in a pull and tug relationship with the pull towards suicide ever increasing. I've lost faith in myself. 

I'm reluctant getting help because I don't see myself as an emergency care though a part of me wants to have an emergency so I can get immediate help. Part of me doesn't think I warrant the help or a bad enough to justify having it. I'm used to living with suicidal thoughts my whole adult life so it's normal for me. 

Do I check myself in a hospital? Should I be getting help? (From my previous post the answer is clearly yes). What help do I need? I feel wrong misstep could send me spiralling into the abyss. 

Thank you for reading.

P.S. 

This is a note I wrote a month ago

Why live?

What is the point of life? All I see is misery and despair. All the beauty has vanished. All the good has vanished. All the love has vanished. I want nothing more to do with this world. The world is better without me here. I hog up resources and take. I'm a parasite deserving of death. There's nothing good about me. There can't be any good about me. I'm a sick evil demon.

My plan for ending it in the future ,1716316725.0,"Once both of my parents are gone, and all the financial affairs are in order, I’m going to leave everything to my older brother for him to give to his son and ex wife. I of course won’t tell him this and will wait until he finds out I left him everything, at which point soon after I’ll kill myself. 

This of course will take time. A long time, actually. My parents are both in their early 60s. So, optimistically, I’ve got about 20 years to go. 

I also got my vasectomy last Friday. That way I have no chance of becoming a father and bringing a child into this world, especially one that’s wired in the head like me. That would be immoral for me to do, intentionally or otherwise. I’ll just try my best to have as much sex as I can, and travel. So there might be some measure of happiness there. But they will all lead to the same conclusion. 

Lastly, I’m going to make sure I don’t get into any relationships. It wouldn’t be right to burden a girl with all of my problems and then leave this world with her alone and lost. So that’s why any sex I do have will have to be hookups of short term stuff.

"My online friend has attachment issues and no irl support system, How do I help him?",1716316329.0,"
He’s expressed suicidal feelings to me in light of his girlfriend going a day and a half without talking to him but there are certain things that lead him to believe that she’s ending things (they got in an argument before she got a new phone and blocked him but apparently they’ve blocked and unblocked each other very quickly whenever they have conflicts). 

He doesn’t have support from family (most his family are judgemental assholes) and in the past year he’s isolated himself from all friends. 

As for the girl both her parents died in the last year, she’s very mentally unstable but my friend wants to be there for her since he has a good idea of the support she needs.

Last night we texted for a while, he felt hysterical and stressed out beyond relief, I didn’t know how to comfort him other than just being present and listening.

I need to know how I can help him because I care about him a lot.

How do you admit yourself?,1716315419.0,"Im 17, and I have never actually tried to kill myself, but I’ve been having strong thoughts that I should lately. I need help, and everytime I try, I always fail to get it. I’m scared that if I don’t, one day or soon, I might actually purposely overdose. I had a plan for tonight, but all I want is help. Are strong suicidal thoughts a valid reason to seek out a mental hospital? I’ve tried to get therapists, nobody will accept me. I’m running out of options. I truly want to die, but part of me is scared. What do I do? These have been occurring thoughts for months, and I feel like i really am a danger to myself, especially after self harming again, although it’s not a continuous addiction for me. How do I go about getting immediate help? I go through short and long cycles, where I feel happy and okay for a short amount of time, but then I get triggered by god knows what, and I start to have terrible thoughts again.

Reasons for being suicidal,1716315947.0,"Firstly, why am I even writing this post? I am unsure myself. It may be a way of trying to get attention and feel validated, or it may be dipping a toe in the water, or putting muddled thoughts on paper in order to try to make sense of them, or see what insight and feedback others give me. 


Recently I have very strong suicidal thoughts. I've never had them this strong. I've been reading about various methods and found one which is, apparently, painless and quick. Those thoughts have become a fantasy. 


My mindset has also changed. I have started to think life is simply not worth living. Suicide seems like a rational, logical, effective solution to the problem of being alive, rather than an unfortunate but necessary action. 


I wanted to try and lay out why I seem to be feeling like this. Here is the list:


1. Perhaps most importantly, I feel suicidal thoughts are the most rational response to being a bad husband and father. I strongly believe my wife and daughter will be better off without me. I know my death will cause them pain, but once this subsides, they will eventually be happier.


When I am having a depressive low, usually with a migraine and inability to leave bed, I see the confusion and hurt on my 3 year old daughter's face. It is unbearable, but also feels like a rational reason to go. 


2. I have developed a dislike of people and feel they're rude, destructive, cruel. I consider myself kind, and cannot bare to be around others and society. I cannot stand that we accept a world where street children starve, or families are victims of war. I cannot ever make sense of it and I cannot bare to continue to have to accept it. 


3. Linked to the above, I am left wing. I see the world as divided into haves and have nots. I cannot stand that some have to starve whilst others live in opulence.


On a personal level, this means I see my every day existence working in professional services/ business consulting as a life of a slave. I literally work with the firm's Partner regularly. He takes home millions, which as a lefty, I do not see that should be his. He enslaves me, and the surplus of my labour goes to him. I wish to escape this life, but I am scared to do so as I think running my own business may fail and I'll live in destituton. Suicide feels like the only option to avoid slavery. 


4. I am overwhelmed by thoughts of the future for which I only conclude it is right that I die first. These include:


- The thought of being stuck in my job

- The thought that my health will deteriorate

- The idea I will be destitute and starve

- The fear of being a victim of war

- The fear of being a victim of violence


5. I have been seeing a therapist and taking antidepressants for several months. I have learnt a lot about why I may be depressed, but I do not see that knowing why translates to feeling any better. 


6. Finally, in a contradictory manner, I also fear the extent to which I have aged and I feel that time has sped up. I am 36, but the past 15 years have gone as quickly as 2-3 years did when I was 16-21. This really depresses me, making me feel I have wasted my life. 


Thank you for reading this.

Romanticizations are back,1716315789.0,"I can't remember the last time I was here and this is more of a vent post than anything. I'm doing much better than I was last year, I'd argue this is the highest point in my life where everything is put together but, I can't get the thoughts in the back of my mind to completely go away. I daydream about my death quite often again, I listen to music that I think would accompany a goodbye video or a compilation of pictures of me with friends and family. I think about their reactions, I find solace in the fact I could be gone and not have a worry in the world. I'm too afraid to anything and it's not like I'd want to leave anyway, but I still can't help but think about it. It breaks my heart because I would hurt so many people around me knowing I carry these thoughts around with me and never let it show. But why would I share this? I don't want anyone constantly worried, it's not like I'm on the edge 24/7. Does anyone else experience this?

Apathetic but here for my loved ones,1716315644.0,"I am typing this while on my way to therapy lol. Whenever mental health professional ask the ""are you suicidal"" question I always have trouble answering. I mean I've been wanting to end it all since I was about 12 years old (27 now) but it's not feasible to do since I have people that actually care about me. So I feel like I'm in an obligatory limbo. So I respond ""no, not right now"" or something similar but idk if that's right either. Because even though I don't give a shit about myself I care deeply for my younger brother and my wonderful bf and the few real friends i have. And I am painfully aware of how each of them dote on me so thinking about the specific ways to kms makes my chest hurt and start crying because the thought of making them sad hurts much more. But then this feeling of being stuck is here. I hate my life but I can't leave. My home life sucks and my mom is partially why I'm so fucked up. I have no intrinsic motivation but I'm an artist. I took up drawing at 12 because of how sad I was and now I can't even get myself to create anything. I feel like a failure and feels like nothing helps, been on so many different antidepressants and on an SNRI currently and still these feelings remain... I dont want to keep going like this but I feel like my brain is locked into survival mode and I can't do more than eat, use bathroom,  sleep, and repeat.

"Midnight Musings May 22, 2024",1716311496.0,"I. To everyone...

1. I have hurt and wronged, my sincerest apologies to you. I don't know why I am saying that here, I should be directly saying it to you. I guess I am fearful of confrontation-- a coward. Often times, I have a hard time sleeping. When it's all dark and quiet, that's when the conscience is glaring and deafening. This is my karma for everything I have done. Maybe someday I will be able to say this to all of you then maybe I will get a good long rest.

2. That hurt and wronged me, I have forgiven everything. I honestly do not remember that many bad experiences with people that would qualify except for one. I have had this bully back in kindergarten who always strangles me. It was really painful. It was very hard to breathe. I do not remember much back when I was young and for me to remember this, it means it really affected me in some way.

3. That showed my kindness in whatever way, I salute you. Thank you. I have no other words but for you to live long and happy lives.

II. Uncertainties

True, life is full of uncertainties and they are not necessarily going to be bad. I just have this hunch that every uncertainty in my way will most probably be disadvantageous to me. That is why I am in a constant state of overthinking. Even the most trivial of things overloads my brain. Did I put in petrol or diesel? Have I locked the doors after I left? Where are my keys? Will I ever be able to get out of my mundane 9-5 job and shift to a more fulfiling career? Have they forgiven me? What do they think about me? Did I step on some dog shit? Anything goes. When you are thinking about everything, chances are, you are not going to resolve those that matter. I want to shut it down, even for just one night.

III. A Chance at Romance

I have had my encounters with it and I am in the middle of one right now. My only question is that, why do I always mess it up. We are in a rough patch. I don't know how I can turn this around. She is great because we are not just lovers but we are also friends. What more can I ask for? It is hard, finding someone that can be both. I don't know if she thinks I am serious when we talk about each other being each other's bestfriend. To me, it is genuine. She's my bestfriend. I mean, I have had people in my life that had been with me for decades, I consider them friends but her companionship is something that transcends time. It does not matter. When I am with her, I am free, I am at peace. Why did it have to be like this?

IV. Scales and Triggers

Do you feel that? Yes, that thing crushing you that gets heavier as time goes by. No one sees it yet everyone feels it. It just a matter of 'how heavy?' and 'how durable?'. There are unlimited combinations of the hows but there are only 2 outcomes to this. Will the scale break or will it be able hold for another day? Sometimes, I think it is going to break, other times I think it can handle 10 times more weight. Right now, it is breaking. There is no single event that caused this. It is the culmination of years of disappointment and regrets. A spectacle where I finally...

V. Cross Over

I am not a big believer of the supernatural but isn't it freeing to be able to stand and watch from the sidelines? What would that be like? Watching the things unfold without active participation. I think I would love that.

Good night everyone.

Suicide and Pregnant Family Member,1716308571.0,"Hi Everyone.

I have come to the conclusion that I want to commit suicide. The only wrench in the plan is I have a close family member who is pregnant. The child is due in late June. Does anyone recommend an appropriate time to commit suicide as to not disrupt the health of the unborn child before or after birth?

I know my death would be disruptive to this family member but I have wanted to commit suicide for a while. I just want to make sure grief would t ruin the pregnancy or cause postpartum depression.

If anyone has any insight, I would appreciate it.

Thank you",TMickey321,,False,1cxbxd7,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cxbxd7/suicide_and_pregnant_family_member/

I don't even know what to do anymore,1716306939.0,"So I moved away from my parents at age 16 to focus on studies and track and field. It all was going fine until I started missing classes and lying to my parents

Not less than a month before I graduate my last year the school has removed my my allowance and I have been hiding shit from my parents ruining my relationship with them more and more (they pay for my food and for me to life here)

Just had a call with them and I have never heard my parents this angry and dissapointed before and the things they called me are just true but they really hurt

I know I'm not thinking logically right now because I'm so ashamed and destroyed because my parents will never trust me anymore and I just can't stand coming home this Friday looking them in their eyes

I just want to lay down in my bed and overdose on opiates but I'm so scared of the pain I will bring to my family who has always been supportive and tried to help me even though I never listen and continue to screw up everything 

I really don't know what to do anymore. If I don't get any grades then my life will be fucked up more than what it already is.

I have never in my whole life has suicidal thoughts but right now all I want to do just forget about all the sleepless nights I have given my family and the fear of graduating without grades

Just another rant,1716306314.0,"I hate existing 
I hate it. I hate being alive. I hate waking up in the morning just to do whatever bs for the day, go to bed, and do it all over again the next. I hate that all my life it just feels like all I am doing is just waiting for death. There is nothing I really want to do anymore. Games that I love to play now only gets opened and then closed repeatedly. Any games that are actually getting played just feels like I just going through the motions formed by habit over the years. The same thing is starting to happen to all the music I like too. I just end up skipping through half of my playlist.

Right now I am an archaeologist. However my wrists are both in pain due to what is likely carpal tunnel syndrome and my shoulders are also struggling to not hurt. I keep looking for other possible career options but all I see are ones I am not qualified for or ones that make less than what I am currently earning. I understand that I am lazy, but I still have a semblance of a work ethic. However, currently the cost of living and the housing market is just so high that I don’t see the point of even trying to survive. I know that my stepfather has worked his ass off his whole life but is still struggling to retire. In my case I doubt I ever will. In the case that healthcare takes a sudden turn to allow for us to work into our 80s or 90s that would feel even worse. Work for an entire lifetime with no real reward at the end.

Currently I am taking a ux design course, but quite honestly, within a week I was really to quit. Being in school gave me such overwhelming stress and anxiety that I tried to kill myself the first time around.

I know that all I am doing is just making an excuse for inaction and avoiding self improvement, but I just feel tired. I am just tired of waking up everyday, just barely surviving pathetically, still living with my parents. I know that all this is just worthless self pity. I know that I can get help. But I feel like suicide is the only real answer. Any time someone tells me about how life is worth living I just can’t believe them. 

The real reason I haven’t tried to commit suicide again is that the last time I tried to take my life I ended up surviving with no permanent damage. What if the next time I end up surviving with such a debilitating injury that I won’t even be able to try again. I know the best solution is probably to either slit my throat, or stab my self through the chest and either catch the heart or puncture a lung and drown in my blood. Of course both options sound extremely painful and I am a coward that avoids pain.

I had cut myself yesterday. I can't stop resenting myself. ,1716305762.0,"It was a culmination of a series of events and emotions that had been festering in my head for the last couple of years.   
I've been racked with feelings of shame, paranoia, depression, loneliness, and self-resentment for so long and today it all just exploded.   
  
It started yesterday at work,   
another situation of my inaction and inability to interact with others led me to make a fool of myself and roll over when someone was trying to antagonize me for something I knew I didn't do wrong. I told my sister about this incident as she was picking me up from work and I started punching the car glove box and bursting into tears. At the time I didn't know why. I figure now it was just a moment of frustration, having been in that spot before. Of coming home from work disillusioned, frustrated, and angry with myself.  
  
The next day, the day I cut myself, was spurred by something completely inconsequential.  
My sister had simply gone out to get some fast food with my other sister and brought some food home and at that moment, I lead myself to believe she had only brought some for her, my mom, and my sister and didn't get me anything. That was it. It was something so meaningless but at that moment, I got very irrationally angry, I don't know why. Typically whenever I'm in situations like this I just ruminate over, or just try my best to ignore problems like this. But I was just so angry for some reason, and I began getting into her face to ask her why she didn't get anything for me. I didn't even care that she didn't get me anything, I had just put it in my head that she was deliberately ignoring me. I felt like she was treating me like I had felt like everyone around me has been treating me, like a footnote. She and my mom got upset and told me that she had gotten food only for her and my sister (who was in the car with her) because they were out of the house and stopped to get some and my mom had already made dinner for me everyone. My mom only received a drink because my other sister didn't want hers. She didn't get me anything because she figured I already ate.   
  
After that, a wave of shame and anger washed over me. Shame I've felt for so long and Anger that was bolstered by that shame. I let myself feed into my own delusions and paranoia and made myself look like the same loser I've always been. I rushed into my room and I couldn't contain myself.  
  
That's when I did it.   
  
I didn't even think. I went into the kitchen and got a serrated blade and started going across the length of my arm.   
  
I kept going till I broke the skin and didn't stop even while I was bleeding.  
  
I didn't even know If I would've stopped had my sister not spotted me doing it.  
  
My sister saw me and screamed for my mother and other sister's attention and they began grabbing me and pulling me down with all their body weight to get me to stop.   
  
I pushed them aside and tried rushing to my room.   
I was stopped before I could reach it and got into a yelling match with my family over what I just did.  
One of my siblings was mad, the other was crying, and my mom was crying and even fainted.   
  
After things began to calm down, me and my mom began talking.  
All that I could think about when she was asking me what happened, why I did what I did what I did, was me looping back and coming to grips with what I had just done. The more we talked the more shame I felt. The more upset I felt knowing that I had just made things worse by hurting myself in front of my family. I was ashamed of myself, just as I've always been, but this time it felt even more harrowing. I know my family will forever remember what I had just done and my mother will struggle to sleep at night knowing what her son was willing to do to himself over the demons in his own mind.  
  
I don't even feel like waking up anymore now. I don't have anything too look forward to knowing things like this could happen to me again.

I Believe There's Nothing That Can Help Me,1716300817.0,"I still struggle with ending it, and that sucks. I've been actively suicidal for months now. And I've been able to inch closer to doing it, but I've never succeeded. Hopefully I will eventually. Hopefully somewhere in the coming couple of months.

I also struggle with wishing my life had been different. I think a lot about certain key points in my life. Points that, if they were different, my life would probably be better. Even okay, perhaps. But I also realize I can't change any of that.

I can't change what happened. And I can't change what will happen either.

After so many years of having depression on and off and actively seeking treatment, I've realized that (for me) that's kind of a hopeless endeavour.

I think at this point I basically know about and/or have tried everything.

When I ask for advice online, 99% of the time I know what the responses will be before they come in. I guess some part of me hopes every time that finally I'll get some advice that will help me, but most of me knows and is resigned to the fact that I won't get that. Just the same old things.

Some vague ""we're there for you"" or ""you have worth"" or a suicide hotline, or saying you should go to therapy, or something like that. There's nothing much new under the sun anymore these days.

But I don't relish saying that. In fact, I hate it. It makes me feel hopeless and it hurts. But it's true nonetheless... and I'm trying to accept that truth.

That I'm just someone who's beyond help. People like me exist, I guess. There are absolutely plenty of people with depression or anxiety or other stuff like that who get better for a variety of reasons. But none of the stuff that helps others seems to help me at all.

I guess the pain is just nestled too deep inside of me. At my core. It eats away at every other part of me until there's nothing left and there's nothing anyone can say or do to help me.

It does make me feel helpless, and powerless, and frustrated, and hopeless though...

Why am I even posting this? I don't know anymore. In some vain hope that this will be the day someone says something that will help me but... I also know they can't. Nobody can. There just isn't a solution.

I know I need to make peace with ending it. I know I need to make peace with the way my life turned out. I know I need to be able to let go of things so I can end the pain. But it's so damn hard...

I never wanted my life to be like this. That's the thought I keep getting back to. I never wanted my life to turn out like this. But it has, and I know what to do about it.

"People who've tried multiple times, what is a good reason not to try again",1716250279.0,"2 years ago was my first attempt and although things did get better for a time, now I feel like everything is just worse. Back then I think I was so scared of actually ending things, I didn't really tried something definitive but still, I found rest in knowing it could work and I'd finally find peace. 

Of course, I failed and fortunately, I was left with no sequels or scars but the shame and regret were there. As I said, my life kinda improved and I found love in a Wonderful person that made me genuinely happy. But like almost everything in my life, it didn't work out because once again, I was the problem. After some rough months I managed to pull through and actually was able to patch things up with her as friends, but ultimately, it wasn't until I met someone else that I was able to let her go. I was a relieving but bittersweet conclusion cause it made me realize that deep inside I will always feel empty unless someone loves me back.

Anyway, things were looking great with the second relationship and I really really felt more in love with her despite al the doubts and red flags. I believed that something better actually came for me. I was, yet again ""finally happy""... Until things obviously went wrong and the inevitable break up happened. She was always distant, never opening or getting too close to me, it was painfully obvious but I didn't want to accept the truth. In the end, she just drifted apart like things didn't matter at all to her. And I was of course left devastated and trried to patch things up several times but she only wanted me out of her life for good. Yesterday after several weeks of no contact, I called her and her new boyfriend answered, giving me confirmation that she never really loved me back, and that she was probably already seeing him while we were ""together"".

Today I'm only left with the realization that I will never be enough for someone, that something will always be wrong or that no one can love me back the way I love them. I will always be the second choice... Feeling empty and worthless, not being able to satiate the killing hunger for affection. I now know that even if things get better, they'll end up getting worse everytime.

I can't go on anymore. I'm still scared of trying and I hate myself for knowing that the people that do love me and i'm going to hurt, will never be enough. This time it will be for good, I won't fail.",rodrigogigo,,False,1cwukrs,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cwukrs/people_whove_tried_multiple_times_what_is_a_good/

Im a mistake, a nobody, a useless piece of nothing, I have no reason to be alive. And I have a bad problem with cutting myself because I’ve started to do it again.

Addicted to plucking my armpit hair - could this cause brain damage? Not sure how long I can do this ,1716299812.0,"For the past two years I’ve been addicted to plucking my underarm hair and spent about 20 minutes each evening doing it.

I’m really scared that this is due to me intensely plucking my armpit hair for so long and the awkward position of tilting my head and eyes towards my armpit which I’m afraid caused a lack of blood flow to my brain and potential brain damage.

The Sadness is On Me,1716299279.0,"As the child of middle-American white people, the kind of family that forgot who they were and where they came from once they got here, almost my entire life has been a search for identity. Not in the angsty teenage sense that found so many of us stoned in suburban basements trading minor, unoriginal insights as glorious revelations from barely dipping our toes in the real world. I've never been able to find much out about my paternal lineage, but the past decade or so I'd thrown myself hard into the Irish identity of my mother's family. They aren't overtly or openly Irish, but at least the lineage is apparent and traceable. At times, that identity has given perspective, purpose, and meaning, like the uncomfortable ""White Privilege"" political discourses at Thanksgiving. Y'know, fun shit like that.

Like a lot of people, I grew up in some fucked up things. I don't think it's of any particular use to itemize or describe those circumstances but I've known much of violence, violation, and a variance of heartbreak. These things are not unique to me. 

I've struggled relentlessly with self-worth for most of my life. Since my early childhood. I cannot say it's entirely bad, but I suppose the wonderful times (which have truly been wonderful; I've been afforded some experiences lots of people haven't in life) are still outweighed by the negative. The dark parts are markedly dark and abundant. In the midst of this self-discovery journey, I held out hope for a long time that I would make it back home. Back to see Ireland, the Small Sea...visit the East End of Glasgow to see where my family fled, before they made the trans-Atlantic journey to lose themselves in American identity. Venture to Northern Ireland to see the H-Block, where James Sands starved himself in protest against English occupation. Purpose and dignity in the harsh Atlantic seaboard, where it can be said that there's no sadness quite like a Celtic sadness. 

I think of this often when I think about the English word 'home' and the layers of meaning it conjures. How we tie it not just to a building, but to family. Warmth, comfort, safety and security. Those sentiments can all come sprawling forth from those four letters. In Irish Gaelic, there are probably four or five different words for this based on context, and I remember how difficult I found Irish at first because there is no possessive verb meaning 'to have'; things are either at, on, or with you. In English, the word 'sorry' comes from 'sorrow', or more specifically being full of sorrow on account of oneself. Colloquialism and the evolution of language brought us a more direct way to apologize in both menial day-to-day interaction and times we genuinely must feel awful for what we've done. English is like that, full of matter-of-fact efficiency.

To say ""I'm sorry"" in Irish now, you would say ""tá brón orm"", which I guess most literally translates to say ""sadness is on me"". To say you were sad at the moment, you would say ""tá mé brónach"", more literally ""I am sadness"". 

I think a lot about Ireland lately. You cannot run away from your problems entirely, no, but I do think you can change your environment. I think about history, of people repeatedly forced into economic exile for centuries, losing their language and constantly occupied by foreign rule. There's been a melancholy in how I exist that probably owes a great deal to this lineage but I've failed to see it, much less harness it. I wish I'd taken a more particular and driven interest in the language before it was too late, especially as I don't think there's a more accurate description of what I feel but for how the Irish say 'sorry'. 

The sadness is on me.

In Scottish Gaelic, the word 'cianalas' is one of nostalgia, of profound longing and homesickness...in Welsh, 'hiraeth'. In English, the sappy and sentimental of whom I find myself amongst often liken the word 'home' to people. We find a home in someone, in a person who purposefully made a space for us in the last place we expect to find it. There was a time when I had found this. I was too cocky, too smart for my own good, too sure I'd outgrown the fucked up that I'd come from. I thought I fell too far from it to let the wood rot of my family tree creep in.

I didn't just lose my home. There were no tragic circumstances. I acted poorly, disgracefully, selfishly and in bathed in a darkness inside me I never knew I was capable of. I didn't just lose my home, I set it aflame and burned it to nothing, kicking about in the ashes after and I've still got the nerve to live each day tinged with a deeper grief and sadness than I never knew existed. In this life, I am both the Irish and the English. 

The sadness is on me. 

It's no longer a profound sadness that longs for the fogged beauty of inland bog or rocky sea shore, or the beautiful person who rivaled such wonder. It's a sadness that aches, that has outpaced time to settle deep in my bones before father time could take my joints. It taunts me to look at what I've done, what I've become, in a dark home with dusty mirrors. Stalks me while I walk my dog. It tells me that everything in the world is a loaded gun in my hands and to use it on myself before hurt someone else again. It tells me that I still have potential and that I will waste it all. 

I have been a liar, a cheater, a disgrace. I have acted in direct defiance of everything I thought I believed and I never knew I was capable. I don't know of any other way to fix this.

Hi everyone,I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts alot recently,I always struggled with intense internalised  mood swings,low self esteem social anxiety,an inferiority complex,and a very vicious cycle of destructive thought patterns,I have these periods of high motivation and confidence,they're extremely short,and I have these longer periods of feeling worthless or completly numb,i'm bad at dealing with intense emotions,I know i need to process emotions in a healthy way,but I'm sensitive and mine get so intense they physically hurt,and my emotions are like an avalanche one emotion and memory leads to even worse ones,and they flactuate a lot like they're so feckle and umpredectable that I can never pinpoint a constant state I'm in,like one second I'm so hopeful and motivated and happy the next I want to kill myself everything sucks while lacremosa is playing in the background,I developed some addictions to avoid my feelings,not substance abuse issues,more like electronic devices and sexual stuff,I spend so much time scrolling doing nothing to drown the world,to the point I drowned my brain,I'm always sooo tired wether I sleep early or eat healthy or do sports whatever I do my head is always foggy I'm always tired and my motivation is null,I don't have any passions anything I try I stop after a while not because I'm incompetent,I just tire of it and lose all my motivation,my interests are as fickle as my emotions,they change so much my life goals everything,they change so fast soo much that I can never see a materialized path for myself,I see Daedalus's maze and I have no Ariadne to guide me through it,and because of that  just stop,I wake up in the morning and nothing no drive no goal no certainty and no reason to wake up(right no I'm majoring in engineering I like it now but I'm sure I will hate it again very soon),I want that fire passion drive,the irony is I have no clear goal but so terrified of dissapointing my parents family and literal strangers,I spend all my day procrastinating like I'm really lazy,life is just sooo boring,I live in a country where I feel stuck,it's a third world country with no opportunities and anything big you want to do is denied to you,I don't know how to love life,to wake up with a goal so clear you can touch it,a fire that makes you feel alive,i want real connection too,like i have friends good ones,but i just feel like i'm always a 3rd wheel a ghost that they forget the moment I'm out of their sight I want to be important to someone to believe I am,but my brain can't believe it I always feel like I'm a burden like everyone in any given room hates me for just being there,and it's very hard for me to keep relationships because I'm also not consistent,my constant insecurity and social anxiety make relationships and interactions so stressful for me like really really stressful,a voice in my head constantly talking to me,and I just prefer being alone it's more peaceful,and I get bored of people?I don't know meeting people ruins them,I like to live with the image the ideal I created of them in my head,and I'm inconsistent one second I want to cut someone out of my life and the next I like them and just as randomly hate them and find them repulsive,I know I'm a coward but I don't have any guidance we don't really do therapy in this country and everyone's too religious,so they just tell you pray and God will help you I tried I failed I'm an atheist now,also I'm pansexual so add that to the list,i just feel so detached like what's the point,the only times I feel alive is when i info dump on my mom or while reading a book even the latter is feckle and I can lose my intrest for weeks,I spend days numb not a single thought goes through my head,I always try to break cycles but they just happen before I even know it,I don't think I'm depressed I don't have the symptoms of depression other than anxiety and low self esteem it's just who I'm I think I do have childhood trauma because of the physical(he used to choke me and beat me so hard I couldn't breathe even spit in my face)and sometimes sexual abuse and assault my brother put me through(I'm 19m) btw,I did suspect bipolar or borderline personality disorder but no I don't have the symptoms,I truly think it's just a me problem,my personality or something I don't know as I said I don't really have a professional to ask,like is it the norm to almost attempt suicide at the slightest inconvenience,that at the slightest inconvenience you go into intense emotional distress like a madman and blame yourself for everything,and feel guilt and every emotion so I intensly you want to end your life to stop this intense unescapable pain, eternal nothing seem like a treath,I know about passive suicidal ideations,how it's healthy and helps us cope,so maybe it's my coping mechanism? although I don't know what's normal that's the problem I have no reference to see wether I'm normal have a problem or just a drama queen I don't know,maybe I'm just emotionally immature,and bottle my emotions too long, because my brother's abuse instilled in me this idea that expressing or standing up for myself will get me hurt because he was stronger than me so now I bottle my emotions and don't stand up for myself because I know that strength is everything and it's stupid to do so because I'm weaker and will just lose so I'm a ticking time bomb,so maybe I have the aftermath of Chernobyl or pompeii inside of me.

My ex got with someone after she said we should focus on ourselves ,1716287459.0,"I’ve marked nfsw work for potential triggering subjects so please be aware. I would hate to trigger anyone.


I’m not sure where to even begin or what is making me reach out. I just know I need to if I like it or not. Well anyways. Gosh it’s been a really long time since I’ve known my ex, we met right before Covid and then a year later we got back in contact and we hit things off, next thing you know we together for 3 years. (Long story short, I guess.) I love this woman with all my heart and still do. But it just pains me because we mutually broke up in February (shortly after our 3 years). To keep it simple I was struggling with my substance use and she was having a lot on her plate (moving out of her place, the break up. Etc.) once we both agreed it was insanely hard because that’s just the way love is and it can be beautiful, complicated and so messy at the same time 😓, we both started focusing on ourselves. For the most part as I hoped (we will get there) 
. During March and early April it was hard but I felt like we made alot of improvements. Life was alright for the most part on both sides. Sadly around April is when I noticed she started slowly acting slightly different. Like she was distant. We both mutually agreed to be apart. Yes, but even then we wanted to be there and just be friends and it was going well. But then she kind of just starts becoming either super distant or she’s super caring. So I’m confused and asking her if she still feels attached like I do in a sense and that maybe a break would be best to focus on ourselves. I thought it was the mature thing to do so I felt ok about it. We met up about a couple days later and had a good mature talk and cleared any problems or concerns quite well in my eyes. So just about a week later, (which would be right now) I see all of a sudden she post on her story (something she never does) and she has a new boyfriend and she’s already changed her bio and everything!?. I’m just utterly shocked but trying my best to not let my emotions flood over and make me do something irrational I ask, “can I talk to you about it for a quick second and ask what is going on? I’m just wanting to be civil after our talk and don’t wanna end on bad terms.” It takes her about 20 minutes but then she hits me with “I know we’ve talked about it but I just you’re too into me still we aren’t even in a relationship so it doesn’t even make it your buisness. I’ll be blocking you, I’m not trying to be rude but you have been immature this whole time.” I am just left utterly shocked because the talk we had was super clear and communicative about what we both wanted. Nowhere in the convo did she claim I was “too into her” she did say that we both felt that way but i don’t know how that warranted such a response ;(. I feel I tried my best to be mature about it all but the only thing I really wanted was straight forwarders which I thought I got. I feel like she’s really trying to prove herself wrong but I know both of us have our emotions all over the place. Atleast. I hope. But the whole thing has made me so depressed and I don’t trust myself anymore. I suffer with ptsd and when I am really trigged or sad I just don’t feel safe in my own body. I know I’ll probably be ok but idk what to do. I just can’t get the thought of self harm out of my head. I feel so alone while surrounded by my people 💔.

It's not about that. It's about how trivial and menial everything is. I'm not religious anymore and never will be again so it's been hard to come to terms with. That there's nothing preceding death - just oblivion and nothingness? Why do shit I don't care about? Why do ANYTHING? It all leads to the same finality. I despise this world, I despise these people who think that what they do means something. If you want to just have fun you're a deadbeat or a loser, but you're just making fun with what little time you have before the clock turns and you are a piece of calcium in a box of wood. Don't call me obstinate or stubborn because I have spent a long time thinking and it ALWAYS leads to the same conclusion. I don't know what I want to do. Try and live a normal life and grind out school or just give up? The first option takes too much time and effort for something that doesn't matter in the end. The second option I also lose. I feel like I'm crazy because I don't want to live in this perverse malignant piece of shit planet with no purpose. We're just fucking monkeys who were lucky enough to have thumbs and a beneficial brain to body ratio, yet we've created this elaborate and intricate idea that were important. Every time I feel like myself for just one moment I'm beat down and subdued into a feeling worse than ever. The worst part: this feeling is all unfathomable to people who have never felt it before. You have to go through it to understand. People try to care or worse pretend to care but they never really comprehend it. How it feels to have 1 life and its wasted.

Thinking about suicide started to calm me down a bit but it still generates some anxiety.

I know for a fact that it would shatter my mom, sister and grandma. I know they love me very much and often make sure i know that. I let them know i absolutely love and cherish them too. They are the best aspect of my life.

That is the only reason why thinking about killing myself makes me sad. I don't want to break their hearts and make them suffer, and leave them with an empty void that'd be left after me.

And so i persist while slowly rotting away. I feel like i'm in a trap.

my mom (while completely drunk) opened the window on 5th floor and told me to jump with her,1716274637.0,"Two days ago my mom came to visit me (23yr F) to go to a free museum day/night event in the city. We are both very close and were excited about it but we both have substance abuse issues and decided to take alcohol with us. Got drunk really fast and at about 6pm I was already exhausted, extremely depressed and annoyed. I called a taxi at first my mom didnt want to go but last second she changed her mind(she wasnt happy at all and wanted to stay out). We got back and I immediately fell asleep. I slept until about 9:30 pm and when I woke up she wasn't home, she got back soon after and was completely drunk. I was severely depressed and she kept pestering me about how I'm feeling and what she can do to make it better and it's my fault and I cant forgive myself for it but I lashed out and ranted about how I want to die every single day and nothing helps(countless therapy, meds, hospitalization etc.) and she's the only reason I'm still alive and suffering. 
After the stupid rant she got completely cold and told me ""Let's kill ourselves now together then"" and opened the window. I was shaking with fear and she sat right by the open window (I live on 5th floor so the fall would be fatal) she was dragging me to the window and yelling at me to do it with her. I started screaming and crying hysterically I managed to choke out that ""Its not always bad"" ran around the flat and jumped to the window to do it but she dragged me away, snapped out of it and started apologizing and repeating ""oh god what have I done Im too drunk Im so sorry what have I done"" she started crying and I didnt have any meds but could barely breathe from the adrenaline and trauma so I called the ambulance. They wanted to hospitalize me but I told them I just wanted to be sedated. They kept telling us to go to the hospital but my mom and I both declined and they injected me with sedatives and left along with police. My mom was absolutely devastated at that point and I was trying to help her, she was pleading me to give her something to knock her out so I gave her sleeping pills and took some myself and eventually she fell asleep while crying and repeating how sorry she was. Next morning I was shaking and angry at the world. We got into a fight cause I was screaming at her to take me to the pharmacy to get my benzodiazepines. After that I took a few and gave her one and the day went by fine. We had fun, saw nature, live butterflies and eventually she went home  (lives in a different city 1.5 hours away).

I immediately relapsed and spent hundreads on drugs and went on a bender. Im sober now(won't be in a few mins cause I want to escape reality) but the scene keeps coming back and I'm terrified and traumatized. I love her more than anything and it's true I have suicidal thoughts every day(diagnosed depression at 13years old, diagnosed BPD at 20) but they're not always as bad. We are both unstable and she is in her 60s and has been an alcoholic all my life. Keep in mind, she is hard-working and I dont have a job so she pays for my living and always took good care of me and works while sober.

I really don't know how to deal with this she's unstable as well and has had some extremely traumatic things happen to her but she always loved me, took great care of me as a single mother and she's my best friend in the world. I told her I forgive her and it's fine, she was drunk but I know both of us are traumatized. 

What do I do? I want to help her because I know she is suffering from regret but I'm also devastated and can't let it go. Should I talk about it,what do I say?

It’s consumed me. ,1716265368.0,"
I don’t have any plans to kill my self, just want to vent. 

As the title says, its consumed me. Suicide and this over powering darkness has truly consumed me, I feel that in a way, I have become it. My mind is obsessed with the thoughts of killing myself, it’s all that I think about now and I get closer and closer to accepting that this is my fate. I am religious and believe in God, and as time goes on, it becomes harder and harder for me to hold onto my religion. I am becoming weaker and growing more miserable. I am filled with so much misery and hatred towards myself, that I’ve only felt for my entire life. It’s so painful to live as someone that you despise, someone that makes you feel sick to your stomach to look in the mirror at. I am invisible and I don’t matter, I am someone who is always put second and someone who is without love. I am without affection and without care. I am someone that is never considered. I get hurt and I am to heal my wounds while the people who hurt me only gaslight me into apologizing to them instead. It makes me feel worthless. I feel as if I am someone that doesn’t matter. 
And part of me thinks of myself as a young girl. At that age I was so bright and creative, I was filled with so much light and care for those around me. But I’ve become someone different. I’ve become someone that doesn’t long to make her dreams come true because I don’t believe they ever will. I am being taken advantage of by my family, while I have tried so hard to create a great future for myself as I come from a poor family I realize that I will never accept poverty. My family take advantage of me. We have about $20k in rent and my older siblings don’t help. I have to spend all my money to dig us out of a hole that dirt keeeps falling into. My credit is ruined because of a poor cycle of generational poverty. It gets passed down and passed down. I was born to help my family survive while all the while this makes me want to die. 
I don’t know why my life has to be this way. I also have health issues. I just look at it. Health issues, poor, invisible. And I wonder why? Is it bad to compare to those who have better conditions in life? But it’s so hard to see others have it easy when sometimes you don’t have money to eat. 
Deep in my bones I want to die. I pity the child that I once was that was filled with dreams. I pity her because I don’t think she will achieve those dreams. 
I think that this has consumed me, I think that I won’t even reach 30. I even made my mom a legacy contact on my phone so she can have all of my pictures. I think that some people are not made to live. I think some people like myself may be weaker and can’t live. I don’t think I am suited for life.

I have 3 choices ,1716265165.0,"What you need to know:

I have a grad in cybersecurity. I recently quit my job as a software analyst due to a horrible manager. I’m downsizing my life and driving Uber. I study each morning for a certification I desperately need for the job I want. I’ve also been incredibly lonesome for the past 4 years and day dream about having a girlfriend way too often. I’m a 33yo straight male. 

My 3 options:

Pass the certification, get the job, and find a girlfriend.

Don’t pass the cert, try again, don’t pass, get another job.

Don’t pass the cert, shoot myself in my car, in some parking lot. 

I’m posting this because option 3 is becoming its own option again. What happens when I get the job and pay I want? This isn’t an ontological question of meaning and being. This is a question of practicality. Of whether it’s been worth it and if I’ll have my moment where I feel like it’s been worth it. 

Most of my hope surrounding this is to find a great partner, but even then, some of my friends with objectively perfect lives are going through a worse situation than myself. In their case, an extreme lack of romance and continual disrespect.

Option 3, to just end my life would be understood. Im getting to the point where I’m just indifferent and partial about my future. The hopes I have can be reasonably deflated and pushed below the surface of my mind. They don’t hold the same inspiring force which has translated to a life that I find to be mostly sad and a waste of time.

What I really need is to somehow genuinely appreciate my life and my future, and it’s so difficult for me to do so.

Drops into suicidal thoughts frequently ,1716263774.0,"Whenever I find myself thinking of something bad said about me, whether directly or (most especially) behind my back, or I think about things to much generally I get really sad and kinda want to die. If I’m left alone I tend to go that way. I either get myself stuck in fantasy scenarios in my head to distract myself, do something distracting (music, tv, video games, etc, though as of recent I’ve become so tired of all that), or think the worst things about myself. If the first two things falter I fall to option three. Being with people can usually distract me but depending on how awkward or poor that interaction went I tend to fall straight to three in an instant, I tend to also info dump my thoughts onto people (particularly more distant ones as to avoid larger issues in the group or annoying them), into a discord server with just me, or (unsurprisingly) onto Reddit. I think some friends found this account a ways back but I don’t feel they check it anymore (which feeds into some of my beliefs about my place in the group) and hopefully they don’t.

I feel like I was just born with a broken heart.,1716263202.0,"I feel like my furthest back memories of life have always just been sad. I remember in 2nd grade having this big realization that I wasn't like other people, I was different. And it made me SO sad. And that feeling never left. 

So much happened growing up, too much to go into. But I grew up with bad folks around. Good parents who loved me, but troubled family members and drug addicts ect. I just remember always feeling alone, isolated, different, sad, and lonely. 

BUT. when I turned 19 I made a decision that I was going to work hard to be happy. 

But now I'm mid 30's nearing 40. I'm still just.... so sad. Everything I touch falls apart, and I lose everyone I love. I feel like I am cursed. Everyone I love either dies, or forgets about me. I feel like I've always been so forgettable.

I've tried all the things, I have a therapist, I'm on meds. 

But nothing really helps with this deep loneliness. 

And as I get older, it just hurts more and more every time someone forgets about me. Or when people make me feel like a ghost. 

I'm on the autism spectrum and I try really hard to act whatever ""normal"" seems. But I feel like people always treat me like I'm stupid for acting ""happy"" or trying to hope for the best outcomes. Sometimes at work when we are discussing important things as a group, I'll say something, everyone will just look glance at me and continue talking over me. Never acknowledge me. This is not just at work. 

I was so happy when someone wanted to be my friend, we hit it off and things were so nice for a while. Until she found someone better. We hung out as a group, and they literally ignored me everywhere we went. And I am NOT joking or exaggerating here, but this is a good example of just HOW invisible I am. We drove past a car that was literally ON FIRE. It was up in flames and smoke was just billowing out into the sky. There were sirens coming down the street. I exclaimed ""HOLY CRAP THAT CAR'S ON FIRE!!"" and pointed. NOTHING. No reaction, they didn't even glance in my direction. 

When we went shopping, they did the same, they would sometimes look at me if I spoke, but never responded. I left at one point and decided to just do my own thing. It took them an hour to notice I was gone. And I really believe the only reason they even came to find me was because one of them wanted a ride back to their car. I did it, but they talked on the phone to the other the whole time and ignored me. Even then. 

My heart was just so broken, I had really thought I found a friend. Finally. But nope. I just stopped trying, I still text and care for them. But I know neither of them really care about me. 

I even tried the whole relationship thing, but that is just too hard for me. I'm not sure if it's the autism or the ace part of me, but really. I just want friendship. Relationship stuff was just so hard and complicated, and I couldn't offer what was needed to the other person.

It's just getting SO exhausting. I feel like every bit of my energy goes into TRYING so HARD to be happy. I really do make an effort. I really believe that most people are good, and I try to be kind and understanding to people. I always try to assume the best, and I try to put love and kindness out into the world any chance I have. I'm working on going into a job where I will be helping people, I just don't want to say what right now. But all that said, it's getting harder and harder everyday to keep pushing myself in this direction. I just feel so tired. 

I've been over spending and over eating. I feel so ashamed of myself, the amount of debt I'm in, I used to be so good with money. Everyone would come to me to borrow money. Now I'm in so much debt. 

I guess what really triggered my emotions right now is that... Once again I thought I found a new friend. We hit it off so WELL at first. I was maybe too excited, I guess I should learn my lesson. But we had so much fun talking about our silly interests, we had similar hobbies. I just can't express just HOW much fun I had, I hadn't been so happy in So so sooo very long. 

And then. They forgot about me too. I don't want to go into detail incase they see this and recognize themselves. I still care about them. I just miss them so much. But like everyone else, they forgot about me.

I wish I wasn't so forgettable. I just want friends. My heart feels so broken. 

It's not just that I want something from people. I want people to love. I feel like my heart is so full of love and it hurts. If it wasn't for my pet I don't know what I would do. I love her so much, I give her everything I have. 

I'm posting here. But I haven't tried to hurt myself in many, many years. It's just I'm having those daydreams again about how nice it would be to just not exist anymore. I just wish life didn't have to be so painful all of the time. I keep thinking eventually things will get better. But they never have. I wonder if it's even possible for things to ever be ok.

And yeah. I just feel so alone and unlovable. I feel so broken. I feel like if I died tomorrow, only my pet would notice or care. She's the only one who has really made me feel like I have any value. In fact, she's one of the only beings that has really made me feel like a human being. 

Anyways, I guess that's enough rambling. Sorry for all the typos, I'm just so exhausting right now and about to knock out for the night. I just really needed to get that off my chest first.

I have PTSD and anxiety. I take medication to help with the masking. But it doesn't fix the days where I wish my body would forget how breathe. I want to go quietly, so that my fiancée just sees me suffer from a medical condition instead of my own self hate. I dread leaving a scar like that on her by my passing, but when I think about the fact that my abusers (parents) would just say I was trying to get attention by hating myself... it makes me want to do it even more. Just so that I can be released from all of this anger and sadness.

Every. Single. Day. Is like Sisyphus and the hill. The days I have where I'm happy I expect the invetable moment where I realize my insignificance. No one talks to me. I don't work because I'm disabled. I'm a shitty housewife. I can barely remember to brush my teeth daily. Everyone I used to know thinks I'm the devils harlot and has taken my abusers side because I'm gay and with a trans woman.

I didn't have a childhood. I was beaten, ridiculed and expected to be a straight A virgin until I was 30. I'm considered an embarrassment to the people who thought I was ""godly"" as a child. I have no purpose but to consume basic needs until I whither away, and I just wish it would happen sooner.

Losing hope,1716262327.0,Life has just been obstacle after obstacle and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. Every time I try to push past it and keep moving forward I just get kicked back down even harder. I've been trying. so. hard. But I'm so tired. I don't know how much more of this I can take. I think it would just be easier to off myself at this point. ,gummybitz-exe,,False,1cwyhfx,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cwyhfx/losing_hope/
Why was I made this way,1716261807.0,"I don't know what I did to deserve being born as a woman. Literally everybody hates women and likes to see them fail, be embarassed, and get hurt. Being a man is so much better.

I wish my parents killed me as a baby, it would have been the rational thing to do. China has had a history of female infanticide for 2000 years and their society was not hindered by this. They recognized that men were more valuable than women and so they killed many of their female babies. They put us in piles of trash or drowned us or left us alone to starve. 

I cant live this half-life anymore, being half as strong as men, half as funny, half as good at leading, crying more and being more emotional and scared. Look it up, all of these are proven. Its worse than being dead to live this way, its an embarassment. 

Womens' hormones during their reproductive years even make them more likely to have depression and mood swings than men, while testosterone has an antidepressant effect and increases motivation and risktaking. Men are biologically more brave and adventurous. Living as a woman is full of pain, including every month just for existing.Because of this even simply existing in a womans' body is worse. 

Men are able to do much more interesting things because they are stronger. Puberty makes men stronger and gives women the ability to give birth. Given the chance, I would have chosen to become stronger. 

Men evolved to be hunters, protectors, and warriors in hunter-gatherer societies while women were gatherers and reared children. Men fought all the wars with other tribes and women were kidnapped from their villages after a war and taken as property because they were helpless to defend against their invaders. I would have preferred to be a hunter/warrior, of course, and be built that way. Men have the honour of being able to say their bodies are built for fighting.

People may say they like women but what they mean is they like women who do what they want and behave how they want. Men dominate in relationships and in bed, while women submit. I don't want to submit, but if I don't people say its unnatural and no one will want me. Maybe it is, considering what I wrote before. So I can never be in a relationship in this body in the way I want.

From the stone age to 1950 or so women were prevented from making scientific discoveries, leading,  and making contributions to society, and our society made many advances. So how can we say that women are valuable? How can we say that patriarchy is not justifiied? We have never even had a president thats a woman before in the U.S., or a female prime minister in Canada. No one wants to elect one.

The saddest thing is sometimes i catch myself accepting how many things I cant do, accepting a life where I am unfulfilled and limited this way, where I can't take risks and have adventures and enjoy what I want, (Most of the things I want to do have men in the vast majority of participants, including reddit) and it makes me sad. This is why I'm going to commit suicide. I can't live in this small, sad life and body anymore. I can't sit here and rot for 60 years.

Soon I will be diving headfirst onto the sidewalk from a high building. My weak woman's skull will shatter quickly and easily and my brains will spill out onto the concrete.

I'm waiting until my birthday in a couple months, and in the meantime I will try to do all the things that I enjoy and are on my bucket list. Even this proves hard however knowing I am stuck in this embarassing body in the meantime. I can't even go out at night to look at the stars in case I get raped or attacked. And its dangerous to do things alone as a woman. If I get attacked, people will blame me, wondering how I could be so stupid to have been out alone, been out in a new place, etc. So, maybe I should end it quicker.

My only hope of living how I want is if reincarnation exists, but even if it doesn't I still prefer being dead to being alive like this.

TL;DR, All of this is to say, I can't take the limited existance of being a woman anymore and I am going to move onto the next life soon.

but the difference is she suffered in silence, and i voice my stresses. i let people know, i ask for help. i help people. i’ve been alone all my life, pushing forward because i love helping people and i thought it would get easier, and i thought i would meet the right people who would help me too.

i left my abusive mom when i was 16 to try living with my absent father who ended up stealing over $3k from me while being more abusive than my mother. i was isolated from peers my age, yet i still managed to get into a top university where i just finished my 2nd year, and i support myself completely.

but i support myself completely. my monthly expenses are over $2,000 and my monthly income is around $1,400. can’t get a 2nd job because of school hours. aside from being unable to support myself financially anymore, i’m also tired of supporting myself mentally and emotionally. i go to therapy regularly, i’ve been on many different antidepressants in my life and im currently on one now as well, see a psychiatrist regularly. i am just tired, and im satisfied with what ive given to the world.

(30M) How to accept my downfall as a man from chad to sad,1716254049.0,"Hello guys, I thank you in advance if you have some minutes of your time to read my feedback and giving me some advices.

So basically, I'm on the verge of becoming mad to the point I may consider the worst.

Nerd, alone and ugly in the past, at 18yo, I realized that I didn't like this anymore and started taking care of myself. I invested almost 2 years of my life, so much energy, focus, dedication in my self improvement and finally got what I wanted, became a ""chad"". Good looks (7/10), good dressing code, good manners and worked hard on my social skill to the point were I was very comfortable interacting with people, even flirting with girls became very natural to the point I never almost got friendzone by a girl at that time. I was successful on every aspect of my life.

But I'm now a 30yo guy that is just leaving the worst 5 years of his life. I was a doctor student previously but paused it to focus on e-commerce during covid period. At the beginning, everything went well, money, happiness, confidence, I was really proud of myself.

But then things went south. My previous successful best friend that introduced me to ecommerce started to be scared that I could take over me in his fame (he was a known business influencer) and destroyed my reputation behind my back to prevent me to network with other people.

Then, I started to experience my competitors trying to pull bad s\* against my businesses to take me down until they succeeded, multiple times, so everyday was like living with anxiety of fear of what will come next.

Then I started to have other issues with my work directly, by having my advertising and businesses accounts blocked multiple time for no reason due to various bugs that triggered safety controls on their side. At some point, I couldn't even open a new gmail without it getting blocked 5 days later by the system thinking I'm a bot.

Everything that I touched since 3 years ago collapsed in the end, and I've not experience success since then. I put so much energy trying to think smart and fixing things step by step, but I cannot take this anymore. When you're at problem #321 and that every time you fix one, a new bs happens just a few days after, that's enough. Imagine 1825 days living in an infernal spiral that repeats itself again and again and again not matter what you do, you can't manage to get out of it. Lost so much money and self esteem that it feels unreal.

No matter what I do, I can't solve or initiate s\* anymore, nobody considers me, even if I ask politely for some help, nobody responds. It's a nightmare.

I'm now living in Malta (small island in the Mediterranean sea next to italy), alone, no friends and can confirm that the spiral continues.

Upon arriving, my flight was delayed, lost luggage, airbnb not available on my arrival. Then I choose another one, it's dirty as hell, ants. So I decided to rent another apartment for 6 months, couldn't find one until 1 month after. The place is good, but wasn't cleaned and ready for my coming in, the manager left me waiting 1 week to send a cleaner, there was like 50 items missing that he still haven't provided me with yet (almost 1 month renting). I've paid like 4k cash on my first day for rent + caution and I'm being treated like s\*....

And the worst for me, it seems like me complaining about my situation to the real estate agent that helped eme get this apartment was a problem for him, so he decided to talk shit behind my back to the network community that we are both member of here in Malta. Full circle again, people already hate me before even meeting me.

I'm a very kind person by nature, I'm always trying to help people if I can and being treated like shit like the previous example is just soul crushing.

As you can see, I got destroyed continuously by my own friends, my competitors and the world in general. Nothing that I do works, and this is utterly affecting my mental and physical. I've got a clinical stress disease that destroyed my skin and my scalp, I've now lost my hair and need to shave regularly (-3 points), I've anxiety crisis all the time and I'm acting so needy and too nice with people because of that.

I feel so alone and desperate that I started to use dating apps again as well. On my first day, I matched with a girl (6/10) on Bumble, she was very cute, classy, elegant. We started to text almost every day a few hours at time. I was feeling so relieved to experience a bit of success again, see that I had still some value as a man. But then, she showed me that she was very interested in meeting me and I was to afraid to ask her out. I'm afraid that because I'm bald she might not like me.

So I waited 2 weeks to ask her out, saying that I was busy, but the only thing I do everyday is waiting for the day to pass and hope that I won't wake up the next day.

Finally dated her, she knew about my baldness and didn't seemed to care. He arranged plans, met up and the evening went well. I planed a pool bar, but we ended up in a restaurant instead. Talked like 2-3 hours until the place closed, I was being a bit too nice because I was not very confident and scared that she might not like me, but still I think she liked it.

11PM, we go outside, I ask her if she wanted me to accompany her home or have a drink, she said no, but ask me if I wanted to grab a bottle of water and continue the discussion outside in front of the bay.

THAT WAS MY F\*\*\*\* CLUE. She indirectly said to me, I like you, but you still have to prove me that we can have a great sex life together, so please activate chad mode now. And guess what? I panicked, couldn't switch my mindset by fear to be too direct and be rejected, thus I lost her. My F\* balls dropped at the worse moment possible, she was there, giving me all the signals, giving me chances after chances after chances to prove her that I'm a sexual guy as well and nothing. Ended the date feeling like a f\* piece of crap and almost cried out to myself at home.

Next day we discussed by text and she told me she enjoyed my company, but she didn't felt chemistry (Logical because I kept talking about bs all night). She asked me if I wanted to stay friends, I said no because it would me feel like shit remembering that night everytime I see her. Maybe I could manage something for a second date, I'm sure I could have, but I was so hurting that I closed the deal directly.

So as you can see, it's a pretty big downfall and that experience with that girl is the last failure that I can accept on myself.

I'm highly having bad thoughts all the time, I just want this pain to stop, I cannot take negativity anymore and I'm considering the worst. I may have money, I'm 30 which is ok, but I can't take it anymore. I just can't.

What's the point if can't I do if I work on anything anymore by fear of failure, cannot meet people anymore, cannot make a girl interested in me sexually and emotionally anymore, even can accept to look me in the mirror anymore!!

A pathetic end to a lifelong struggle with OCD,1716253267.0,"Posted in r/OCD aswell

I’ve had OCD since I was maybe 6 years old, it mainly manifested itself in heavy intrusive thinking, extreme perfectionism, and BDD. I remained extremely functional and taught myself how to cope with the disorder. However, I’ve recently developed a new form of OCD. I have an extreme fear of not being able to sleep and the anxiety from that fear is keeping my heart racing and my mind wired. I start to sweat, roll around, and hit myself in the head as I panic trying to get some natural sleep. It’s almost paradoxical and I’ve developed relentless insomnia to the point where I’m no longer even myself. I don’t talk, my hairs falling out, I’ve got massive purple dark circles, I’m abusing substances, and my other mental health disorders are being violently amplified. I was very functional prior to this development and now I’m heavily considering taking my own life as it seems like the only next step out of this situation. I’ve tried sleeping pills and they aren’t sustainable. 

I don’t lightly toss around the idea of suicide and when it’s taken into consideration it’s done calmly and logically. OCD is a hellish disorder where you’re essentially not in control of your own mind despite all actual reason. If I’m at risk of developing an infinite amount of subtype disorders then there truly is no escape or proper way to cope with this type of life. 

It’s almost funny

I can’t do it anymore,1716253137.0,"I’ve been suicidal for the last few years but no one in my family knows. I’m in my 40s. I take care of my disabled mother alone with no help or break from my sister. I work 2 jobs - or I did until I lost my second freelancing job. I have a house that needs repairs I cannot afford. I have medical debt and student loans I cannot repay. I have a migraine disorder that leaves me in pain nearly every day and I am living with the dental fallout of 30 years of eating disorders. I need dental implants I cannot afford or failing that dentures I cannot afford. I I also have PTSD from years of abuse from my father which has rendered me incapable of forming lasting romantic relationships or even trusting men  at all. But, I have life insurance though, good life insurance that would help take care of my mother and repair my house that could then be sold for her upkeep in assistive living. I’m past the suicide clause in my life insurance, so I know my mom will get everything. 

I’m such a failure and just so f’ing tired of it all. My mom and sister will be better off. I know that they will grieve, but they’ll see that in the end it was the better choice. 

So I know - probably that this summer, I am going to end it. I even know how I’ll do it and I’ve written a note or two. I look forward to the peace.

I feel like I ruined my future,1716251856.0,"I'm studying software engineering. It's my 2nd year. I've always loved art since I was little so I thought it would be a good idea to study programming and combine my drawing skills with it by becoming a game dev or sth like that ( I was like 17-18 when this became my goal, I know it kinda sounds silly.)

I'm also living in Turkey so it's better to have a more steady job since economy is really bad. However when someone sees my art they say I'm wasting my talent or like I should have studied fine arts. I still have a lot of time to draw except when I have exams but when people tell me stuff like they it completely ruins my mood and I can't help but to think like I've ruined my life. 

I've thought about dropping out ( I dont hate software engineering, I like it but I've realized that I love drawing more in the past years) but this year and last year's university and dorm fee has already paid and idk how the future will be if I just drop out and become an hungry artist (since sadly it's a possibilty too especially in my country)

These are the reasons why I get suicidal. I've already suffered enough from losing my mother and many other traumatic shit so I don't have the energy left to deal with more stuff. Howeber everything makes me so paranoid and I can't stop overthinking

I’m not interested in the idea of this life . I figure it’s better if i just go now so i don’t have to live it out. The only problem is, if i kill myself my mom will have to suffer the result of it..But at the same time, it’s better for her even if i do go.

Tried yesterday and omfg,1716249890.0,"In hospital at I type this. I convinced myself to snort 2 m30s (have fentanyl in them) with no one around, knowing that snorting one had me waking up in an ambulance twice cuz I was discovered. I thought it would work. It feels like that quantum reality waking up or becoming conscious in another life when dying in the last at this point. I get worsened symptoms, but this is absolute worst.

I came to very bizarrely, discomfort. Barely could make plans to get up, pulled down vacuum, and IMMEDIATELY noticed my feet felt like both were cramped up insanely bad. Stumble around, get to my knees and crawl to fridge for drink. Barely cognitive at this point still. Make a bath, thinking cramps are still normal at this point. CNS rallies and mind starts to delusionally figure that what's happening is a good thing. Stand, still intense pain.

Try to lay down on couch. Time goes by, realize I'm still unable to sleep LIKE ALWAYS, problem in feet becomes unrelenting. After some googling, convinced I have caused nerve damage with m30s. Longest nerve, stretching down to feet, tends to go first, when a more natural process occurs. Still made the most sense. Still in pain and numbness or feet and ankles. Walking like I need crutches.

Is this what they mean when they say overdosing isn't reliable and you'll wish you were dead if it doesn't work? 

I already wished I were dead. If now I cant walk, too, on top of all this? Oh my fucking God. There is no fucking God.

Edit: should I tell them it was a suicide attempt? I've danced around it in the story, but never mentioned insufflation. When labs tested pos for fentanyl I acted surprised, but confessed taking what I thought was like hydrocodone. They're still doing tests and keeping me while I wait for room to open.

“Why don’t you seek out therapy” you might  be asking? I do and had an incredibly rough session where we argued nearly the entire hour. I must admit, though, that it was out of me very desperately wanting him to tell me I was a bad person for a laundry list of reasons that is long enough to be a post by itself and say that I may have a mental illness that is causing a lot of the problems I’m experiencing, but I didn’t get the answer I wanted. At the end, I asked if he had any clients who were in a similar situation and what treatment plans he had in mind because I felt very lost. He said I should think for our next session if I’m going to genuinely put in the work to change or see therapy as a quick fix for problems and that will determine where to go from there. And, honestly, I don’t think I can force myself to get better? I can’t consistently eat at least two meals a day or fully take care of my teeth (I’ve had gingivitis for years now, which is lovely) when asked to, so I feel aversive to even thinking of tackling my serious problems. It’s not that I don’t know why I do things, I just can’t commit to anything. I’m going to quit therapy during my next session because I’m giving up. Even if I don’t say that I’d quit, saying I don’t want to get better will most likely lead to my termination as a client because of him previously stating that therapy isn’t meant for quick solutions. I went to a college therapy program twice, then a private practice with a therapist, and now this counselor through a program for people with low income. I don’t have the energy to restart therapy again for a fifth time.

I’m here because I have no real support system. I have a girlfriend and one friend (who I don’t like but I also really need the company of someone else) that I have been the emotional support person for lately because of his friend dying. Even if he wasn’t grieving, he tends to say something like “well, that sucks” and changes the subject if I’m complaining about something so I don’t do that anymore. I cut my parents off years ago, and even if they weren’t as abusive as they were, they don’t understand mental health stuff and wouldn’t comfort me regardless of how badly I felt. My girlfriend asked if she could help in any way and I told her that she couldn’t.

Because how could she help if I can’t help myself either? I’ve been waiting around for my life to improve and it just hasn’t despite how much I tried. I want to give up at this point. The only thing preventing me from ending everything is that my mother is still listed as my Payable on Death person  from back when I was coerced to do so at 19 and that I have no access to methods that are guaranteed to work where I also can’t be revived in time by anybody. They say that your twenties suck, but my life is just plain dogshit at 23 and I genuinely can’t think of how it can get better from here in a way that makes me want to still be alive.",Thr0w4way_Acct,,False,1cwt3af,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cwt3af/it_just_keeps_getting_worse/

I'm losing the mental strength to keep myself from doing it. ,1716245926.0,"Suicide ideation is something I have been dealing with for over 20 years. I used to have the strength to talk myself down and rationalize not doing it, but I've been getting tired over the years. Having children made it significantly easier to avoid any close calls. Recently, I've been having a few really rough years due to an abusive marriage and a career in the military keeping me moving around and away from my family and friends. I've been pretty much isolated socially for years.

Divorce is finally looming on the horizon along with my getting out of the military. I feel like I should be celebrating, but I have an irrational fear that I won't be able to prevent myself from hurting myself once it happens. Being around my family and needing to provide for them has been a huge motivator to keep going. The military also removes people with suicidal ideation from duty and there is a strong stigma against it. 

If I lose those two motivators, I'm not sure I can keep myself in check in moments of weakness. Now that I'm getting out of the military, I'm willing to entertain pursuing psychiatric help to prevent myself from self harm, but I'm not sure that will be enough.

I had so much ambition and drive growing up then everything started going downwards. Dad got arrested when I was 9 and lost everything he had. Although he was falsely accused it hit the family hard and since then we haven't recovered all those losses. I tried to find ways and means to get my family out of the hard financial times but due to what happened everyone in the family is being too cautious. I bring up a business idea and they throw it out the window. I could feel that if nothing is done we'll end up suffering a worse faith but no one believe it. My dad got out of jail and everyone thought things will change for the better but it just got worse and worse. People fled with his hard earned money, even after finding him not guilty the government still took a lot of his properties and his businesses. I saw it all coming and warned everyone but none of them would listen and now we've hit rock bottom. I've tried so hard to stabilise the family but no one supports or even bring a suggestion to how to solve this issues. I'm just tired and I feel like giving up since no one cares.

To anyone who this relates to. Keep pushing forward. ,1716241983.0,"I'm a 27 year old male. All throughout my life I have been a social outcast, been told I won't amount to anything, had some crazy shit that has happened to me and it has effected my mental health. I've been pretty low before. But I'm not complaining because people go through crazier, worse things than what I have. The best part of it though is that some people come out the other side amazing humans. 

One thing and probably the most important lesson that I have learned in my 20's is that every struggle is an opportunity for growth. In order for us to become physically stronger we have to put our body through workouts. Our muscles tear and they become harder and bigger. The brain is a muscle. In order to gain mental strength we have to go through hard things. This includes any type of struggles you may have whether it be depression, substance abuse issues etc. 

Once you come out the other side whether you realize it or not, your brain is calloused. Every hard thing that you will ever go through is going to be easier. You are going to be set up for success and able to accomplish anything you put your mind to because when the hard parts show up they're going to be way easier that whatever it is you're dealing with or have dealt with. 

I was thinking about this today while working. In this day and age especially, mental strength is the best weapon you can equip yourself with.

I don't have anyone to talk to about my problems,1716239135.0,"I have been living with my parents for a year and a half. I was living in Chicago for a year and a half, but I had to move back in with my parents because I blew all my money on drugs and lost my job. I made more friends in Chicago than I ever have in my life and it was a life-changing experience. I have always had a really hard time making friends, but I found so many people I have so much in common with and had the best times of my life. I even fell in love and got to spend hours holding someone I love which I have never done. I have a lot of mental problems. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 6 months ago and I have been taking Lithium. It has helped manage a lot of the symptoms. I used to punch metal over and over until my hands bled, and when having an episode I would walk down the street screaming at no one. I would get so sad I would cut myself deeply and pour salt in the wound. I haven't cut myself in a very long time, about a year. I don't get angry and scream anymore and when I punch objects it's very minor and less forceful. When I spend time with people for too long, I shut down emotionally and become unreachable. All of these things have made it very hard for me to make and keep friends. Nobody I met in Chicago talks to me anymore, probably because I made a bunch of really negative story posts on instagram talking about how I want to die and have no reason to live. I feel like such an idiot for doing that, and I know it's made everyone want to keep a distance from me. In a fucked up way it's what I wanted; I feel like I want to self destruct hard. I used to smoke meth and I had quit until about 2 months ago when I relapsed. It feels so good for such a short time, but it's caused me a tremendous amount of pain and has run my life for the past 10 years. I have no friends in my hometown and my parents don't want to listen to my problems. Nevermind that my mom was on drugs while she was pregnant with me and my dad beat me until I turned 16 and emotionally abused me throughout my life. I seriously think about blowing my brains out every day. I've even been taking the steps to get a handgun license so I can make the decision whenever I'm ready. I want to make music more than anything, but I can't get shit done because I'm so fucked up all the time.

I wish talking to a therapist worked, but I've been through 5 this year and none have helped me. I don't know if advice can be offered. I know there's beauty in this world and it hurts even more having experienced it. I want to fall in love again and it kills me every single day. I feel like I have nothing in this world, blowing all my money on drugs. I feel that my existence is pointless.

I was pretty sure that would work for me. since February I had various opportunities to take it, but I was so afraid,I was afraid of taking it and instead of healing myself it'd do the opposite, driving crazy, bringing trouble to my parents, ended up in a hospital etc.

But in the deep I knew that everything would be fine if I take it and let it work inside of me,but my mind force me to stay at home every time and blame myself for not taking it later.

You know it’s over when thoughts of suicide have started to actually calm you down,1716236678.0,"I’ve thought about suicide for a long time now. Been suicidal for several years. I don’t know if there was a day in the last two years that I haven’t thought about suicide. The weird thing is, that when I first started getting badly suicidal, I was scared of it. I was afraid, I would hyperventilate thinking about it. I wanted to escape it. But over the time thoughts about suicide have started to actually calm me down, cause when Life is so bad it only makes sense. It’s the finale escape from all this suffering. I know now that I’m broken. I think my mind is lying to me when it tells me to hold onto hope and frankly so many people have died before me and will after me, so it’s not as scary as it seemed to be at first. 

When I fall asleep at night I think about killing myself, cause I’m starting to look forward to it. I wish life was different. I wish I never made the mistakes I made. I wish I could be happy and enjoy life, I wish life wasn’t so unfair but sadly I’m depressed, I made the mistakes I made, I can’t enjoy life and life is unfair and I also don’t think I can change my way of thinking. I think I’m broken, so suicide means freeing myself of this pain once and for all. 

I used to be so afraid of how my family would react to my death and I’m still scared that they will think I’m selfish for it but with time I really am starting to realise that it will be the best for them! I’m such a burden to them and I think they know that, even if they don’t want to admit it, but I am. So knowing I will relieve them of this burden that is me also makes me less scared and sad about suicide. 

So when it gets too unbearable (so almost always) thinking about suicide calms me down, sometimes I can even smile thinking about it, cause it will be the end of my mental pain.

"29M about to graduate college, feeling shattered and in despair",1716234849.0,"Hi good folks here, sorry for the long post ahead.

As the title suggests, I am graduating college either end of this year or the next (if it is the latter, I would be nearly 30 y.o.) Not to sugarcoat anything here, but here I am in my room at 3am writing this, occasionally breaking down because I realised how much I have failed at this age.

I was actually supposed to graduate at 28 one year ago, but my dad fell seriously ill right when I was supposed to start my graduating thesis, and he has been bedridden and in a sickened state ever since. I have been finding ways to help my dad, to the point of feeling he would leave me real soon. My mental health, which has already been significantly affected due to a multitude of issues (eg. psychiatric abuse, polydrugging and having to suffer debilitating side effects, childhood bullying, lgbt issues which led to my church excommunicating and even calling the police on me), had reached a state where the only way I thought I could be free from them was to die. But my parents need me, and I don't want to let my future self down, if ever I could get out of my complex trauma and OCD (I don't even want to think about my dad's health atp). I always tell myself to press on, and one day I can find a way out... It has been nine months and I am only beginning to ""thaw"" from my freeze state, which was caused by significant compounded trauma issues as aforementioned. But by now, my brain has been damaged and in a poor state.

Now the existential crisis is so crippling because I am already significantly behind others my age. I live in a country where males graduate a bit later (around 25/26), and females too (23/24), so I think that while it offsets the age gap compared to elsewhere in the world, I am still a whopping 4-6 years behind my peers, who are perhaps already working in their second jobs at this point. I am so appalled at my current state that I feel like dissociating each time I think about this. It doesn't help that the rat race is intense and prevalent across all demographics here... I am not convinced people have it worse than me.

What can I do? How do I start? I was supposed to do an internship before I graduate, but because of my depression/trauma/ocd/medication withdrawals, I had to put that as well as my thesis on hold. Now I can only prioritize my thesis and put career development in the back burner (for now), otherwise it would be too overwhelming for me. Essentially I am graduating without an internship. I can forget about getting married cuz no one in my country will want a ""failure"" like me. People say to take one small step at a time, and you would eventually get to where you want to be, but the odds are so stacked against me that I do not even dare to make the first move. Then again, I refuse to give up. I want my future self to thank me for persevering and not dying.

If anyone who can at least relate to falling behind, but managed to turn their lives around, please comment and shed me some hope. I need some fuel and guidance. At the very least, let me know I am not alone. This is enough to keep me going and know that I am not a hopeless cause. I may not be able to reply to every comment as I am quitting reddit real soon, but I will always be indebted to your concern and input as I take the leap to my next chapter in life.

No one survives a successful attempt. I'm not even angry anymore, I'm just thinking that if I'm gonna have to endure this cycle for my whole life, what's really the point?

I hate my body and life,1716233274.0,"I never saw myself as pretty, I remember hating my face and body since I was around 5 years old or so. My first memory of feeling insecure about my looks was when my mom was putting on moisturizer in the bathroom, I looked in the mirror and felt disgust at my chubby face and beady eyes. I told my mom ""I'm ugly"" and she just laughed and dismissed me by saying ""no you aren't"" and left. I just looked back in the mirror and told myself ""yes I am"" and went to go cry in my room.

Ever since then I had a habit of degrading myself for my appearance. As I grew up I developed more flaws and insecurities, I tried to stay away from people and out of the spotlight because I was so embarrassed by how I look.

It didn't help that adults were constantly making fun of me for being frail and skinny. I was extremely picky so I rarely ate, and if I did eat it wasn't much. I couldn't help it but I felt like it was my fault and that I was weak and pathetic for not being able to handle something as simple as *food.* So I ended up underweight and malnourished.

Once I started puberty everything just got worse. My entire life I was told I'd develop a mature, womanly body only to end up short, flat chested, petite, and curveless. I had my hopes up thinking I'd graduate high school looking like Jessica Rabbit but just a few days ago a woman confused me for a 10 year old.

The worst part? I have no one who understands me. Every single woman around me is busty, tall, curvy, and anything BUT petite. They always tell me I look like a model but those are just empty words. Models can't be short, and sure they're thin but no one really likes *thin.* And especially no one likes *flat.*

They always say ""at least you can wear cute clothes"" like what? Children's clothes? Why the hell would I wanna wear Jojo Siwa merch at 19 years old? At least they can wear lingerie and shit, the only underwear that fits me are fucking sports bras and kiddie underwear.

The biggest reason I hate my body is kinda embarrassing but whatever. I've always wanted to be a music artist, but as a woman the only way you can create music and be successful is if you're conveniently attractive, which I'm not.

I don't know a single modern female musician that looks like me. Not one. They're all tall, curvy, tan, have cute little noses, big eyes, full lips, gigantic breasts and butts, they have everything I don't have. The only way I can fulfill my dream is by plastic surgery and I don't have any money at all for that.

I'm not good at anything else except drawing and you can't draw for a living. All careers that include art are extremely underpaid and I'm trying to survive here.

Another reason I don't wanna be alive is my childhood, this is long enough so I won't go into full detail but my childhood was extremely underwhelming. I grew up socially isolated in a small, rural town in a state no one even acknowledges. We have little to nothing fun to do here and I always envied city kids because they grew up with so much more than me.

I wanna give up because I don't see any reason to be alive but I don't want my only friend to go through my loss, especially since they're almost as lonely as me. It hurts so much to feel this every second, everyday, but I can't get mental help at this time. I'm trying to fight the thoughts and feelings but I'm losing.

I feel so pathetic because the average suicidal person has a good reason to want to die, mine is just ""wahhhh I didn't get the life or body I wanted wahhhh 😭"" and I feel like such an ungrateful person.",popmybubblegum,,False,1cwo2lo,51,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cwo2lo/i_hate_my_body_and_life/

Does it really get better?,1716229357.0,"I just created this account. I turned 25 on April 30th and have been contemplating suicide for over 10 years. I live in a metro city in India.

I wanted to join the Indian Army after high school and passed the exam five times but was always rejected in the interviews. After taking a gap year to prepare for engineering college exams, I didn't score well and settled for an average college, which I eventually dropped out of to pursue a Bachelor's in Commerce. I graduated in January 2023 but struggled to find a job and failed four competitive exams. I lack concentration and have never been academically successful.

I have played sports like football and badminton since childhood but never made it onto any teams. Despite loving football, I never excelled in it. I come from a typical Indian family where children are beaten for mistakes. My parents beat me frequently until I turned 20, and my mother still does sometimes. I was bullied in school and had few friends until I was 15, when some friends stood up for me.

I've never been in a relationship despite having multiple crushes. I distance myself from friends and now have none who remember my birthday. I feel lonely and crave a relationship but have never had one.

I envy my brother a lot. He has always been better than me at everything. He was invited to play football, attend birthday parties, and adored by our relatives, while I wasn't. He beat me at every game we played and was popular, coming home with friendship bands while I had none. He even copied my idea in a drawing contest and won a prize, while I got nothing. He would point out my flaws and made me feel embarrassed.

A girl I liked only talked to me because she had a crush on him. He got into one of the best engineering colleges and now works as a Class 1 Officer for the Government of India. Meanwhile, I'm failing every exam and living with our parents. He has always received priority treatment from everyone. We don't talk anymore, and I don't blame him. Even if I achieve my career goals, I will still be in a lower position than him, which is demotivating.

At 25, I still live with my parents and am constantly yelled at for not having a job. I have never been emotionally close to my parents and have a strained relationship with my father, who belittles me. I found solace in going to the gym and running, but my parents made me stop, thinking it was a waste of time. Since then, I have felt at an all-time low, sleeping 12-14 hours. I feel empty and spend most of my time staring at my books, unable to concentrate.

My suicidal thoughts began at 15 when I considered jumping off my apartment building. After failing my final Indian Army interview, I wrote a note to my family but didn’t follow through. Another episode occurred when I was about to drop out of college and thought of hanging myself. I hated every moment of studying engineering and often cried at night. My mom saw me once, and I confessed my misery. After much convincing and beatings, my dad let me drop out, though I never mentioned my suicidal thoughts.

These thoughts have persisted over the last five years. I've come close to acting on them and have considered jumping in front of a train to ensure I wouldn't survive. I have notes saved in Google Drive for everyone close to me. If I decide to go through with it, I'll print them, send messages, and end it. Even if I achieve my career goals, I fear nothing will change. I'll still be alone, with only the gym as a highlight of my day. Rich and successful people like Chester Bennington, Avicii, Kurt Cobain, and Sushant Singh Rajput also committed suicide, so I doubt my situation will improve.

Please someone read this,1716229183.0,"Here's some background. I have a boyfriend of six months and we're moving in together soon. I moved to Vermont from Texas last year after a painful breakup. I struggle with suicidal ideation and impulsive decisions. Everything feels like a dream right now. My 21st birthday trip back to Texas didn't make things feel any more real. And my new job feels like a daily battle. I always try to find excuses to not go in, and sometimes I fake being sick so long that I actually become sick. I feel like I'm going insane. I just wish the plane crashed and I was the only one who died.

I'm overwhelmed with anxiety, constantly feeling like I'm on the verge of a panic attack. I find myself doing stuff like cleaning and organizing, desperately trying to regain control. I compulsively shop online, unable to save any money. My emotions are all over the place, with angry outbursts occurring randomly. The simplest things can make me want to cry, like someone petting their dog in a movie. I also experience moments of intense joy when something small goes right. My mind jumps from one thing to another, constantly shifting focus. One moment, I'm obsessively searching for affordable apartment listings for me and my boyfriend, and the next, I'm mindlessly playing games or binge watching shows for hours. Then I’m scrolling online and I can't help but dwell on the negativity and evil in the world. Then, I find myself researching gardening and homesteading, only to switch gears and look up workout routines while doing squats. And sometimes, I just lay in bed in the dark, completely zoned out. 

 My 13-year-old little sister is in the psych ward right now. They found a three page suicide note on her. She’s been doing Percocet and smoking weed and she’s just really headed downhill. I feel like I abandoned her I want to take her in and away from my toxic family that treats her like she’s a Demon spawn. But I feel like with everything I have going on mentally I might not be able to be there for her how she needs. But I feel like with all the beautiful nature in Vermont She will thrive because nature really does heal and I can also have her volunteer at a farm to get her out of her head a little bit. 

I feel overwhelmed by the sadness and hopelessness that consumes me. The thought of being forced to work until I am too old to enjoy life or even find solace in retirement is unbearable. It seems like everyone is trapped in this existence, and I am filled with a deep desire to end my own life because I am utterly exhausted with everything. The burden of bills and worrying about  getting money MONEY MONEY MONEY will always sicken me, and I am convinced that this world is nothing but a repulsive disgusting scam meant to suck the joy from everyone and everything. My struggle with my weight, constantly hovering over 300 pounds, feels like a life sentence ill never outlive, and I find myself going between starving myself and compulsively eating for days on end. The urge to end my life is so strong, but then I am reminded of my boyfriend, my mom, my sister, and even my dog who depends on me. Once again, I am trapped in this suffocating cycle, unable to escape due to the fear of judgment and concern for others emotions. I no longer wish to continue living. I cant bear it any longer, i just want to die and i don’t want anyone to notice once im gone. I just wish i never existed tbh. Why am i forced to live this horrific life?

And don't tell me to ""talk to a friend"" (all the crisis line ppl always say that (that or ""take a bath"")) because the only person I think I'd trust talking to is already going through serious health problems atm and I already said I don't want to be a burden anymore.

Please help me keep myself safe.,1716227176.0,"I am sorry for being vague about some things. Please just hear me out if you have the time and inclination.

I cannot even put my thoughts into words properly right now. I have a lot of work to do which I need to complete by a certain deadline. But instead of being productive, I am letting my suicidal thoughts paralyze me right now. I cannot think of anything else except for how I feel like I cannot go on anymore. And I cannot do anything else except freeze.

I have been suicidal for many years but I am still alive. I have sought professional help before and worked on myself to the point where I at least rationally know that I must live and that I should keep myself safe until these thoughts pass. I am currently in a physical location where I cannot harm myself and I am still trying my best to motivate myself to do things. But it is just so difficult. I want to break down and cry to someone about how suicidal I feel. I have been trying to be grateful for all that I have in life but I am not going to lie, I have been suffering for quite a long time due to various reasons and I am exhausted due to the fact that I have to ""fight"" all the time.

I know some very good people but I could not possibly think of telling them what I am going through given particular circumstances. Also, I cannot call the suicide hotline because I am in a place where I cannot compromise my status by revealing too much about my mental health, and I currently lack access to a therapist/psychiatrist.

I just need a sign that I am meant to keep on going. I just need to know that things are not as bad as I think they are and that things will not turn out to be as bad as I think they will. I want to know that I can turn my life around no matter how long it takes. I want to know that I can make it through tonight... tomorrow... day after tomorrow... and so on.

I know full well that I should live, but I fear that I will eventually voluntarily leave this world while I am feeling strong urges to do so. I want to let these thoughts pass, to do my work, to show up like a normal person tomorrow and to continue living my life... but my suicidal thoughts are just so intense at the moment.

Please help me keep myself safe. Please send a few kind words my way. I do not know what else to do. This is probably my last resort. I may not reply to you but I would be so grateful.

I betrayed a good friend and I can’t live with myself. ,1716224592.0,"Hi. My name is Abigail and I’m 21. I have struggled with anxiety and depression on and off for years. This year was supposed to be different, I finally found medication that worked for me. I thought things would get better. 

But no. I have lost a lot of friends this year. Some just drifted apart, which is fine, I know it happens. But I also lost a whole group of friends in Feb because they didn’t agree with one of my political opinions (which I only posted to my personal Instagram story, I never even talked about it otherwise). They were otherwise good friends, and I’m still grieving the loss. I turned 21 about 2 weeks ago, and my remaining friends didn’t show up to my bday dinner because they all had things going on. Only my best friend E stuck by me. 

Anyway, one thing I like to do is go online. I have a whole community of online friends. I have never met them in person, but they have helped me by giving me advice and just talking to me. I became really close with this one girl who’s around 26, and she was a really really good friend to me. Like she seriously cared, and I would never ever want to hurt her or take advantage of her kindness. I told her everything, and she told me a lot about herself; we both had our struggles with different things.  She was going on a road trip and told me she wanted to visit me and take me out to dinner for my bday. Today was the day she was supposed to visit me. 

The fact that this online friend wanted to go out of her way to see me, spend time with me, and spend money on me says a lot about her. I was so excited. 

But plans changed. This weekend, I went away to the beach with 2 friends: my best friend E, and a new friend B. I thought it would be so fun to invite this online friend to join us for dinner on Saturday night instead of Monday night like we planned. I was nervous bc I’d never met an online friend irl before, and I thought it would ease my nerves to have my friends around, and I thought it would be cool for this online friend to meet my friends. Everyone— my friends, my online friend— liked this idea. The new plan was: my online friend would drive 6 hours to see us, and she’d arrive in time to take us to get dinner and drinks. She had already booked the hotel. 

Then Saturday came. On Saturday morning, B announced that we were driving 40 minutes away to go see one of her boy toys. For context: I don’t really like B, but E invited her to this beach vacation. B is loud, hangs around with bad people, and we don’t have anything to connect over. E and B only connect because they both like to smoke, and when B is around, sometimes her personality will run off on E. B said we were going to spend the whole day with her boy toy, and I should ask my online friend to just meet us there. I said no, that’s wrong, I’m staying at the hotel and waiting for her because she’s already driving 6 hours to see me. B got upset at me and started yelling at me in the hallway of the hotel, saying I better call my online friend now and I’m coming with her and E. 

I didn’t want to make a scene. I crumble under pressure, and I have trouble standing my ground. So I ended up calling this online friend and, like B asked me to do, I asked her if she could meet up 40 minutes away from the hotel. Of course, this online friend got mad, said I was so rude, and said my (only) friends are bad. B heard and started arguing with her through the phone. It was a mess. But this online friend spent $200 at the hotel and it WAS rude to ask her to go another 40 minutes out of her way. Now I’m never seeing this online friend in person, and she doesn’t even want to be friends with me at all anymore. 

I deserve it. I betrayed her and exploited her kindness. And I can’t live with myself knowing I did that. Her voice keeps playing over and over in my head like a broken record. She sounded hurt and heartbroken. 

I don’t have this online friend to talk to anymore, but she was seriously a good friend when I felt my real life friends weren’t. I can’t bear to lose another friend. These past few months have already been shit. I want to kill myself so bad. 

And I was so selfish. My first mistake was inviting her to hang out with my friends in the first place. THIS GIRL DESERVED MY UNDIVIDED ATTENTION. And then I should have stood up for myself when B tried to tell me what to do. 

As for E, we had a talk because she is still my best friend. She was outside smoking when all this went down. She had no idea that B wanted to stay with her boy toy the whole day. E had every intent to drive us back in time to see my online friend. It was E’s car. 

I still feel like I can’t talk to E about how I feel because she’ll just say that my online friend is a bad person for not wanting to stay friends with me after this. BUT SHES AN AMAZING PERSIN. She’s just sensitive, like me. And I knew what I did was wrong. I already sent her many heartfelt apologies but she’s done with my bs. I wouldn’t want to be friends with myself either. I don’t think I can even live with myself. No wonder E was the only person who showed up at my bday!

I think I’m going to end it sometime this week. It sucks that I won’t get to see myself get older, but it’s what I have to do because I’m a horrible person with no hope. I lost so many friends and I think I’m the common denominator. I’m a little bit scared of dying because I know I belong in hell, but it’s for the best.

Feeling low ,1716222438.0,"As I cut myself, all the memories come back, overwhelming me with pain I can't handle anymore. Each cut brings out all the regret and moments I wish I could forget but can't stop thinking about. I've tried to find hope and hold on to it, but it always slips away.

I'm sorry for the pain this will cause, but the suffering inside me is too much to bear. My mind is full of sadness and despair, and I'm too tired to keep fighting. The scars on my body show the struggle I've been through, a struggle I've now lost.

To those I leave behind, please know this isn't your fault. You did everything you could, but I've been trapped in darkness for too long. This is the only way I can find peace and quiet the constant pain in my mind.

Forgive me for not being strong enough to overcome my struggles. I hope that after I'm gone, you can find comfort and remember the good times we shared, not just this final moment.

I am now a mother, the thought of leaving my child fills me with overwhelming guilt, I love them so much. The selfish side of me wishes for this constant struggle of internal turmoil and up and down emotions to end. Sure I have good days, good weeks, but are they worth the down days, the down weeks? 

If my attempt 9 years ago had worked I wouldn’t be a parent now and it would be done. I feel I need to stay alive now. On days like this all I can do is cry. I am trapped.

I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was 12. I have 2 serious attempts under my belt. 5 psych stays, rehab. I have over 5 years clean and sober but the mental health problems stayed. I won’t be ending my life today, but i wish I could.

I just can't take it anymore,1716214083.0,"Since my 16 yo (I'm 23 now) I've made a plan for my suicide at the age of 40. I was too optimistic to assume that I would like to live till 40. My mom thought about abortion, and my aunt advised her to do this as well, but as you may assume she didn't do that. I'm always asking why. 

I always was the smart child. Until uni, which I left in two years after not finishing the first academic year twice. I've worked in customer support, until I didn't understand that every time I face any difficulty, I scream at my screen where the chat was. 

After this, I move to one of the friends I've got at uni, and he helps me financially after I left my customer support job. Here starts a small piece of peaceful time for me. We've got married because we planned to move to another country, and it seemed to be easier if we would marry. Approximately half a year after this he tells me he loves me for the first time not being drunk. There were other times he told me that, but we either both were drunk then, or he was drunk. I didn't believe him, and I still don't believe, but tell him the same. 

Why didn't we leave the country? Because the next day we married I woke up from the calls asking if I'm okay. That's how I discovered that the war has begun. He can't leave the country, and I can't leave without him. Though everything was not so bad and he had a job with high salary at that time. 

We moved from place to place several times, until we found a good apartment in my hometown, but here come the problems. His health goes downhill every day, and he discovers he has atypical epilepsy seizures. Once his boss tells him his raise will be for less than 2% of his current salary, he quits it. We spend our credit cards limits and are in debt. I find one job which seems to be a scam, then quit it and find another one. He finds a job with much less responsibilities and salary, we've almost paid our debts to the people who helped us when we couldn't find a job. 

But here I find myself useless and helpless. I can't find anything that keeps me alive. Not enough money to keep studying singing I'm not even good at. Not enough money for gym I sometimes was not able to make myself visit. Not enough money for good food I choke on. Not enough money for doctors and medications that don't make anything better. I'm not good enough for any job that can pay me more. More than half of my salary goes for a rent. Not enough money for a garbage food either. 

If I'd start cooking or move to my grandma, I wouldn't live for more than a month. I always fail to complete my job requirements. Sometimes (like today) I cannot log in to do my job, because I am garbage. I cannot find a suitable and reliable method to end this that would make my husband and elderly think that it wasn't a suicide or that I went missing.

I said I wanted to be admitted at the hospital but the doctor said I wouldn’t want to be there becase the people there are sicker than me.

this weekend I had a very bad mood and had episodes which I can’t recall, my boyfriend told what I did (only to myself), but I think mostly self harm. even thought of cutting myself

been three days taking compulsively two clonazepams and two diazepams at the same time like twice a day. and a oxicodone later on the night. also having a lot of intrusive thoughts

I finished all three of my microneedling sessions and now im thinking about embracing the microneedled scars.,1716212698.0,"As the title says, I had finished all of my microneedling sessions and now im thinking about embracing the scar as a ""battle scar"" instead of trying to hide it.

I already talked to a dermantologist several months prior to getting the actual procedure done and I was told that im supposed to have atleast 3 to 6 microneedling sessions depending on the severity of the scar.

When I got in time for the session, I was told that 3 treatments was all I needed because the scar is not super deep. Its keloided some, but dermantologists have seen ALOT worse. Unfortounately the doctors have said that it most likely will not be completly removed and will still be visible but MUCH more tamed down.

Now that im 3 weeks post of my first treatment and heading closer to my second microneedling session, im now considering just embracing the scars as ""battle scars"" instead of trying to tame down its visibility.

On one hand, I can't embrace a scar as a ""battle scar"" and get microneedling procedures at the same time, and on the other hand if I had canceled my microneedling appointments mid treatment, then ill be left with a half microneedled sh scar.

Can someone embrace a scar and get microneedling treatment at the same time, or does that sound silly? Again, the dermangologist said that its probably NEVER going to completly go away, but it can be tamed down a bit.

Also I stopped wearing my jacket as much so thats a step in embracing my ""battle scar"".

I don't know why it started in the first place but I was a kid when it all began. As far as I can remember, I was 14 when I first did it. It was fun for me and felt like it was necessary. I used to hurt myself multiple times in a day until my teacher found out and informed my parents. They made me promise not to do it ever again and bought me a cream to treat my scars. As a 14 year old child, I managed to keep the promise for 3 years and then I did it again. But this time I did it even more unconsciously and in front of my mother. She didn't realise until she saw blood drops on the floor. I was emotionless and looked numb when my parents were screaming. I still have that scar and I sometimes look at it whenever I feel like doing it again. I then continued this 2 years later and those were getting deeper day by day. It was the only way I could cry and let it all out. I didn't know what was happening to me. I was convinced I was crazy. I then burnt my thigh. But in between all this, I used to bang my head and punch the wall and pull my hair and scream as well. I am someone who has a lot of patience and I rarely get angry or take out my anger on others because I would never want to hurt anyone. But I was most comfortable hurting myself and that made me say extreme negative things about myself to just feel those emotions.

Now I've become this completely emotionless numb person and. My mind and head is chaotic otherwise and I am always scared. Why do I still get thoughts of self harm?

I suck.,1716209295.0,"I have no reason to be suicidal. I have a partner, dog, good paying job, house, and a loving family. Not one thing traumatic about my upbringing. However, I am, and forever have been a truly unremarkable human being. I am quiet and reserved. I am lazy. I am not a good friend, nor am I a particularly good partner. I have no passion for anything. For all the opportunities I have been lucky to be presented with, I have let most of them slide for fear of stepping out of my comfort zone. 

I think for this reason I have literally no capacity to deal with anything even slightly negative that happens to me. All it takes is one bad day at work, or an argument with my partner and I spiral off into a pit of self loathing that will last weeks or months. Each time it seems to get worse. I drink and gamble which feeds the circle of self hatred. I’ve stacked on weight, but I am constantly exhausted and have no motivation to do anything about it. 

I provide no real benefit to the world for being in it. A real waste of a life that by almost any standard has been filled with privilege and opportunity. The only thing stopping me from killing myself is the guilt I feel about being depressed.

How do I let the loved ones in my life know…,1716209021.0,"I want to start this off with;
- my mind is made up, please do not try to convince me not to do it
- i am not looking for any sympathy just an answer

I would like to know how i should tell people that i will be gone soon, i am preparing letters for people who i do not want to tell in person, but the main person i want to tell my Girlfriend of 3 years.
If for whatever reason this information matters we have been together since Year 10 of highscool, and talking on and off a couple years before. I am also her first long term/serious relationship. 

There are two reasons to why i want to do this; 1. i dont want it to be as big of a shock for her, as she herself struggles with her mental health, 2. i feel like i owe it to her to warn her, she has tried her hardest to help me with other related struggles (she isnt fully aware about my history with suicide but she knows about my other struggles).

as an extra point is there a way to tell her so she will not feel as much guilt (i know it impossible for there to be none) with what will happen to me. Or is it better to just not tell her and keep her in the dark? 

Once again i am only looking for an answer, please DO NOT try to convince me to not follow through with my plan.

I'm older now and not wise at all. I want to change from my miserable life. I just cannot see how i can do it. I redid my resume and it is awful. I have no accomplishments or certificates or anything. I am thinking of going back to further my education however i am afraid of being a broke college student again.

I know something has to give. Lately I have been thinking of killing myself to relieve myself of this life. Maybe I am not cut out for it. I have no savings since I live paycheck to paycheck.

I am not married or have any kids or pets. I do not know what I want I know I do not want my life as it is now.

I am so tired of feeling dread due to my job. I hate it and myself so much. It feels like a noose around my neck. Even when i am not working the job eats at my mind and soul.

I wish AI would eat up all of the call center jobs. Those places are hell on the mind and soul. I wish I left 10 years ago. Now I am nothing but feelings of dread.

I have my work computer on waiting for work to start and there is a pain in the middle of my chest. I really want to take a knife and stab my chest to end the pain and my life.

Recently, my mental health is deteriorating. It has always been. From being happy to out of nowhere being depressed. I have completely isolated away from my friends. They have noticed how dissociative I've been. I am not my usual happy self anymore. My head hurts whenever I cry. I'm out of breath when I do so. I can't bring myself to get help. I've always relied on myself ever since. Nowhere to go despite having the best caring girlfriend. I've been wearing a mask whenever I am around her—laughing, joking around, just generally making her happy and feel loved. I love her. I genuinely do. Her family trusts me but the problem is, I don't. This is the worst down point. I can't bring myself up anymore or even distract myself. Finally got the guts to open up to a doctor which my friend referred to me and was diagnosed with Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure (PNES). Didn't get a comprehensive diagnosis because it was out of his scope of practice. I know how these work. Despite being in the medical field and encouraging others to get professional help and to open their minds about how being under meds can help you, I can't accept myself relying on medication. I deny all mental illnesses that I think I have (self-diagnosis). I attempted to OD years ago but refused at the last minute. Now, I am thinking of actually doing it. I have planned enough. I hate to say this, tell me how selfish I am, but I am planning to break up with my girlfriend rather than leave her out of the blue.

There is nothing that brings me true or lasting joy and I constantly fantasize about just doing it, just sticking that barrel in my gullet and popping my body like a party balloon or leaping off a tall guardrail and plunging to my immediate death.

I have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder which converge to make every waking second of every single day of my life the most mind-breaking and stressful experiences I can fathom, and the beauty of it all is that there is no recourse. No one will believe me when I say that the pain is this great so I just swallow my words and let my stomach vomit into my hands when I'm by myself. I guess this post came out of that bile.

What's the point? Can anyone here be the one golden ticket out of all the countless people I've ever encountered to actually either tell me the truth or at least something fucking MEANINGFUL? I swear to God it's like everyone is such a colossal fucking moron and I cannot stand it, I just absolutely cannot stand knowing that I am this internally perceptive and the stimuli that I have to perceive with such intensity, those being this wretched life and this planet's abysmal inhabitants, bring me such overwhelming fucking pain on such a constant basis that I would 9 out of 10 fucking times prefer the void of death to the continued onslaught of bullshit which, contrary to the popular practice of saying hollow pleasantries to the fucking suicidal in order not to placate them but your own shitty fucking selves entirely lacking in humanity or imagination, does not actually get better but instead only increases in difficulty and scope until one's inevitable demise.

I'm not going fucking crazy, I've already gone fucking crazy. How could you not in this kind of a fucking world? Really? All of us would otherwise normally agree on a regular Tuesday at the water cooler that, ""Yeah Bill, this world really is crazy. Bonkers stuff going on all the time, always has been."" ""Gee Tom, you're right. Crazy world we got out there!"" But yet when one of your fucking own truly know this and feel this and experience this to such a maddening degree, you must feel that you have no clue what you're talking about when you look glum at your feet trying to muster your paltry consolation.

Offing myself this September ,1716204804.0,"Tried hanging myself couple of week ago and the wire i used broke. Tried to take this as a sign to atleast try to change or find meaning to life. Well i did found one and desperately tried to focus myself into it. But its not enough.

Currently im taking my last subject in uni for the third time this semester and im afraid that im failing this one too. I made a deal with my parents that if i didnt pass this semester they'll kick me out or just kill myself. And they'd agreed to it.

I already chose the easy way out because i am not afraid to die anymore after multiple failed attempts. Most of the time my family is correct that im a personafied mistake. Every time my family has a problem it always include me like My grandparents dying because of me.

Its true that i am their greatest failure or the ""king of failing"" which reflects to my attempts of offing myself multiple times.  So this August or September ill try to live for the last time or atleast enjoy my last moments. I did enjoy a few memories I've made and i am happy for the few things ive done even tho there's still many thing ive wanted or dreamed of to do.

Thank you for anyone who read this up to this point. I really appreciate it.

I am terribly scared,1716204588.0,"I have been just diagnosed with clinical depression. I had tought that my occasional suicidal toughts were normal, and the feeling of dread were merely more frequent anxiety attacks. However, now that i understand what is happening, i fear that i might decide to end it all.

I have dreams, everyone has. I do not want to give up on them; however, i am doing nothing to achieve those. Not only that, but i reaalized that in a moment of weakness, i might bring myself to take my own life. I fear this. I GREATLY fear this.

Of course, it is possible i am feeling this because of a mere moment i had, but it truly think it is possible. I have never, ever been this close to the brink before. I don't know what to do.

After being diagnosed, everything made sense, but also got somehow worse. I didn't feel like brushing my teeth, like taking a bath, walking the dog, studying, go to to sleep, get up, watch a movie, play video games, draw, clean the house, spend time withy family or anything as such. After the diagnosis, not only i haven't felt like doing so, i simply did not. My room looks like a hoarder's house, and the stench of my cat's litterbox makes me want to puke. I managed to bring myself to cleaning everything yesterday, but it took a lot out of me. I don't know what will be of me from now on. The amount of money i spent in a local prep school will go to waste if i simply stop going to it, but i feel terrible whenever i think about it. I don't know what to do.

The worst part is that i can barely cry. For years i have had this problem. Maybe it is because of the emotional supression i exercised in my childhood, but even at my lowest points, even when i feel like so, i can't manage to cry. I've been trying to little to no avail. Oh well.

I just hope one day i may return to this post and see how far i have come. But for now, i need to struggle until then.

I’m (not) alright,1716203760.0,"Ok, for starters I don’t know how fucked I am? Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if you guys agreed with me. You know that point when you’re sending all your friends and family gifts? When you reach out to acquaintances you haven’t spoken to in years. Or your apologizing for things you did decades ago that really only you remember? I’ve spent all my money, I spent the last couple months hanging out and hugging my mom and dad more. My mother and I talked about how we’re both getting puppies next year and how we are going to raise them together. I even started texting my brother who I’ve never been close to. 

Thinking about suicide doesn’t even spook me anymore. Death is just a part of life, sure not every life last that long and some last awhile. There’s no rush of adrenaline or deep rooted instinctual fear when I imagine going through with it anymore. It’s like thinking about the weather, imagining a daydream, and it’s as important as the Games of Thrones series finale. I mean, I’m sure it will suck and overall be a very unpleasant experience, but hey no more surgeries, no more pain and IV into my heart, no more drowning in pharmaceutical. Maybe if there is an afterlife I’ll finally be able to eat… I haven’t eaten since 2014. Sorry I’m ranting

It’s just. I go to a therapist. I see a psychiatrist. I’m on four different antidepressants. I’m on anxiety meds. But I just, know that I’m in a very dangerous place. You know that feeling. The high before you step off the edge except the edge is me taking all my heart medication at once after my parent take their sleeping pills, so they don’t find me til the morning. It’s weird. It used to make my heart race and my hands shake when I thought about how easy it is. Now it’s… just, weird. 

It’s not something to be upset about. I won’t be sick anymore. Hell I almost died last year from sepsis and a heart attack, and it was like a switch went on in my brain that said “yep, that’s it. 12 years of intense suffering is good. I’m out” and I’ve actually felt lighter since then. Happier. I’ve started drawing again.

I've been wanting to get a therapist but they are too expensive and my dad doesnt want me to since he knows he's emotionally manipulated me and doesn't want to make my 9yo sister a foster child.

From a young age ive been deeply traumatized by my parents' divorce. They tore each other apart with assault, alcoholism, their own suicide attempts. I was 11. 

I've never wanted to grow an ego or be a liar, two things they hate about each other. Both of them are alive.

I dont talk to my mom anymore, talking to my dad is intimidating, he's a conspiracy theorist that forces his opinion onto his own children because he can't change anybody else's mind. They never taught me how to be strong, only to be scared. Scared of people leaving. I abandoned religion a long time ago, once I realized how fucked my life was already.

I've tried for so long to be comfortable living by myself. The hobbies I thought I was interested in, I realized that I just wanted to make my exfriends proud. I desire physical affection, not even from partners but from basically anyone. I want somebody to love me for who I am, someone to just hold me and say that they care.

I feel hopeless and selfish,1716193681.0,"I (37 m) have been dealing with depression on and off for the majority of life due to my upbringing and various factors with emotional abuse, sometimes physical.

I have been married for 10 years to my partner who I won’t name but it would appear the relationship in coming to an end of which we have 2 children (one from her previous partner) which is devastating and I have tried to improve the situation and taking  but does not appear to be working.

I’m also currently having issues at work which are partly self inflicted due to my autism  and may result in me losing my job which I understand is on me and I feel ashamed and useless because of it.

I feel hopeless that my life is is over and everything I’ve ever known that is good is going to go away, my partner, my children, my job everything and I feel selfish for what I want to do.

I’ve tried to get help for my issues, myself and partner have been to marriage counselling which seemed to work but we are probably in a worse situation where she feels not listened to and that I don’t talk enough and I have tried to fix this but I have come to the realisation I can’t anymore and she deserves somebody who can give her the emotion support I can’t.

I mainly feel guilty and selfish about taking my own life because my youngest (biological) son is 6 who is also autistic for the last few weeks he has been the only thing that stopped me acting on my suicidal thoughts but the last couple of days I’ve been prepping to end my life as I can’t bear the pressure and the emotional turmoil I’m experiencing. I know he won’t understand and it makes me feel even worse because of it.

I have been self harming for the last few weeks, I told my partner that I had been hurting myself due to the stress but she was very cold about it which just made me feel even more isolated.

I’m sorry for the rambling post, I’m currently waiting for my partner to leave the house so i can arrange things before I go. I just wish my brain worked normally and I could make the people around me happy and not feel like I’ve been battling everyday and being a burden to anybody who is in my life

im out of options ,1716192099.0,"I hope you can take a moment to read this because I really need someone to listen.

Hello who whoever could be reading this im a 16 year old boy who is having some issues. throughout my life, I've struggled with ADHD and learning issues. Despite my best efforts, my grades haven't been the best, and for the past 12 years, I've been battling thoughts of suicide. Every time I tried to talk about it, I felt brushed aside. For the past 12 years my friends are the only one who been able to keep me on my feet.

As the middle child and only boy in my family, I've always felt overlooked. Both of my parents grew up without their fathers, so my dad doesn't really know how to be a father, and my mom struggles to understand how to treat a boy. This has led to some deep-seated issues, including being treated unfairly compared to my sisters

Growing up, my parents would spend a lot of money on my sister's name-brand clothes and other items, but they never spent anything on things that would bring me joy. My sister has been abusive to the point of trying to harm me, and yet she faced no consequences. In contrast, I was severely punished, even beaten, for minor things. Not with normal items i been beated with golf clubs pans and other blunt force weapons i wish to not say

Recently, I asked my parents for a small increase in my allowance to cover educational expenses, like transportation and robotics equipment. My sister argued she should get a raise too, simply for social activities, and my parents sided with her, leaving me feeling more unsupported than ever.

For my birthdays, I never received anything I wanted. Instead, I was forced to celebrate in ways that suited my sister, including attending her favorite band's concert, and I was punished and physicaly attacked (slapped) for not appearing happy. Meanwhile, my sisters get cakes and gifts they desire.

Despite attending a prestigious high school and dedicating myself to robotics to make my parents proud, they never acknowledged my efforts or achievements. They never attended my tournaments or took an interest in my hobbies. They only seem to care about my sisters' special moments.

I’ve reached out for help and asked to see a therapist, but my family laughed it off. Just 2 weeks when i was sick with a fever (39 degree fever im not sure of the proper temp) i had to walk myself 20 minutes just to get to the hospital and they got mad rather then actually care for me cause i was not at home. The suicide hotline in my country doesn't speak English, and I feel completely out of options. I am exhausted from being ignored and pushed aside, doing chores while my sisters do nothing. All i ever asked was to be recognized and be accepted im sure thats not much to ask right? i never had a proper talk because they always forced me to lose never be able to talk freely about my situation. 

Ive sent out gifts planned gifts to the people who actually cared for me incase i do need to take this route planned gifts if i manage to find a way to push forward.

This is my final cry for help. I have a few options first I have a bottle of 99% isopropyl alcohol or i could go with the jumping i currently live pretty high up 47th floor and im sure the fall would be enough to go quickly. I’m at my breaking point. I don't want to do this, but I need someone to see me and understand what I'm going through. All i ever wanted was to feel welcomed, connect, recognized by my own family",BetterHelp3770,,False,1cwa7cl,4,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cwa7cl/im_out_of_options/
I failed a course and ruined my future,1716191450.0,"I am a college sophomore, and I took 22 credits in the Spring semester so that I could graduate a year early. All courses in my major are either offered in Fall or Spring, which makes it incredibly inflexible for students. I was already ahead with the degree program because I overworked myself these few years. I had to take 4 classes, along with their labs (separate courses), in order to take one senior year course. I took 3 of them in this semester and will take one in the summer. I unfortunately failed in one of the courses, but got an A in the lab. I am very poor, and because of being an international student I don't have any financial aid. I am autistic and my country doesn't offer higher education for us. The cost of one year of college is around 60k. I begged the professors three times but they just didn't care. I tried so much to pass all my courses, but I just am a big loser. I have very less hope that I will be given the senior year course this Fall, and so I might not be able to graduate next year. I really tried helping my parents out. I tried pursuing my dream of being a professor. But because I am a stupid person with no brains, I failed this 3 credit course and ruined all my hard work. I cannot do another summer course that could be an equivalent for this one because I truly cannot afford it. I also cannot be a part time student in my fourth year because there is cost for living as well on top of part time tuition which I cannot afford, and being a part time student will affect my visa status.

I don't think I need therapy or any kind of depression treatment. I don't think my depression is the main issue here as I wouldn't even be depressed if it wasn't for what is my life.

But when I reported it to the authorities they couldn't find enough evidence. Even though there were so many screenshots of him admitting it. But you know, he comes from money and his mom works at the courthouse, he probably payed his way out of it. I hate this world. It used to be so fuckin colorful and seemed so amazing. There were so many things I wanted to do, I wanted to travel the world. I want to go back to when happiness wasn't my only goal. To when happiness was just default, it was just *there*.  Everything is so expensive. Everywhere says they're hiring but when you apply you don't hear fuck all from anyone. I need to move out. I can't keep seeing my brothers face everyday. I've been cutting myself almost every day just to cope with it. My brother gets to live his happy little life being cottled by my adoptive mother like he's some fucking God sent. He put me through so much torture and yet he gets to live here with my parents rent free, Job free, free wifi, free meals. He gets fucking babied. I don't know why I still give a shit about my adoptive mother when all she does is drink booze and tell me that I fucking ruined my brothers life by ever reporting what he did to me. That he's the one who's suffering from it. Not me. Not the little 10 year old girl who was petrified, who could feel the pain as he went inside of me. Who tried to slit there wrists at 10 years old after being assaulted by my older brother. I 'd get threatened by my brother if I ever told anyone. He'd chase me around the house with a fire stoker and try to stab me with it. The one thing I cared about is gone and never coming back. She was my dog, my dog that I loved more than anything in this world, more than happiness. And now she's gone. It's been about a year since she passed and I miss her more and more every day. I just want to be happy. Why oh fucking why can I not be happy. I just want to die, let me die, let me fall asleep tonight and not wake up. There's nothing for me here, there's no way out of this, I give up. Death? Just take me already. I don't wanna be here. I was born into this world and Immediately discarded away.

I get it and I don't. And I'm so sick of losing to this weird rule. You can treat someone the best they've ever had. Go hundreds of miles and several hours out of your way.

"I'm 30 years old and I feel like my life has never even begun, and it probably never will.",1716187580.0,"I'm tired.

I thought I had finally gotten a job I was actually good at, and where I was accepted despite my very prominent autism, and that allowed me to live in a place i don't hate. But once again it's gone. My contract is not going to be renewed and I am going to be sent back to my home country since I'm on a work visa.

With the added insult that i won't be able to get another job in the uk ever, because of the idiotic new work visa rules.

Last time i was in my home country, before moving here, I was homeless for a year. It was awful. Honestly left me traumatized. This time my mum has a place where i can stay for a bit, but it's not much better. It's in the middle of nowhere (I can't drive, tried to learn, never been able to), completely isolated, and it's the tinyest place where i won't even have my own space.

I can't do it anymore. I fought so much to get here, endured so much, and I can't do it all over again. 

I don't even know where to go from here. With the uk being closed as a possibility, all that's left is european countries where i don't even speak the language. I doubt i'll ever be happy anywhere.

for 30 years it felt like poverty continously just... puts my life on hold. I keep moving from place to place but can never stay enough to form any meaningful connections, friendshilps... nothing.

I feel so worthless and alone.

I don't know what even is the point to keep struggling for this kind of life.

At my age i have no meaningful friendships. Never had a relationship. Never even been kissed. Because aside from my many other issues, figuring out how to survive one more month always takes priority.

I just want to kill myself before my visa runs out. The idea scares me, but I honestly don't think I have anything else to live for. I am scared of hanging, because i know i'll somehow fuck it up. I wish i could just find an accessible tall place to jump from, but most local bridges seem to have fences. I was reading about Beachy head, which is a bit far away, but maybe seems like a good option.

"My suicide largely revolves around the reactions of others, and I mainly feel euphoric from how it would hurt them.",1716183765.0,"I'm not sure why.

Every time I think about killing myself, I can only imagine the reactions of my friends and family and how they would be so deliciously hurt: them wishing they checked on me, wishing they saw the signs, wishing they loved me more. Living in grief because they failed to give any attention to how I was feeling. It makes me feel euphoric to imagine them finally caring about me, having to carry that shadow on their heart forever, finally being immortalized in someone's memory as something they miss.

But I also think about it from their perspective, with ever-consuming grief, looking for me where I usually would be and not finding me there, going to talk to me and thinking ""he's not here anymore. i forgot."", because I was such a significant point in their life that it feels like something is missing. And I think about how I've experienced that grief, and I don't want someone to experience that grief, and I don't want anyone to be hurt (but I really do at the same time, if that makes sense. is that weird?)

And then I think about how maybe they won't miss me at all, that I am just a fading memory, a gust of wind that leaves you thinking ""wow, what was that?"" and forgetting it even happened a few minutes later. Because I have never been something significant in anyone's life. I am a leech; I take and take and take until there is nothing left for them to give me, and then they leave with no second thoughts. No one notices when I'm gone, and no one has ever cared when I was gone. 

After I got caught out before my first attempt because I tried to say goodbye to my friends, no one ever checked on me. They forgot about it. I was forced to go to two therapy appointments due to being a minor, had many of my rights to things taken away, but this was forgotten about after a week or so and I never went to another therapy appointment. Only one person ever checked on me after, my best friend, and I know my risk still worries her. I feel bad about hurting her (but she's hurt me so much worse, though she doesn't know that), and I love her to the moon and back.

The only thing keeping me from going is a suicide pact with my best friend, who has attempted once as well as coming close to attempting again multiple times. Not the most healthy way of helping each other, by living for each other, but it's worked to keep us alive this long, and I don't really know why.

This is mostly just a shout into the void, I guess. No need for anyone to respond, but it'd be nice to know if anyone's experienced this confusing oscillation between excitement over hurting those close to me and the horror and sadness over hurting them.",Wide-Strike-3562,,False,1cw88qi,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cw88qi/my_suicide_largely_revolves_around_the_reactions/
I can’t do this,1716157920.0,"I can’t do this 

I (21 m) am 7 weeks post breakup and the pain is unbearable right now. I was dumped over text. We’ve been together since right before 11th grade (4.5 years) and she told me she felt compliant to me for 3.5 of them. I was controlling in some ways (so was she) but I also cared for her when nobody else did and We both were long distance for college and that was a strain but we also got so excited to see each other and I thought we had such fun every summer when I’d stay with her. 

The day of the start of the breakup was Easter. Two weeks before she had seemed distant but played it off as that she was stressed about school. That was the first time I’d ever questioned anything. Our goodbye was still drawn out with lots of hugs and a long goodbye. Felt nothing abnormal as I drove back. We talked normal on Easter about our plans for her spending a week in TN (fam moved there) and what we’d do in Maine. That night she sends me an insta video and I realize I’m out of the picture and lost it. That turns into  her admitting later after I gave it time to cool off she doesn’t have feelings, but then said we’d call tomorrow. We never did

Next day she slowly starts removing everything and when she finally texts it’s just quick “I don’t want a relationship anymore” and I spiraled after this.

3.5 weeks later after that I finally got her to talk (over text again) and we had what I thought was a productive conversation about what happened. We agreed to talk again in two weeks and added each other back on insta. We talked ab a lot of stuff but a big thing was her not feeling comfortable with my family. And I said it was a bit harsh to use that as an excuse but unfortunately, I agreed my family while loving to her and me was a bit much. Led me to want to stay at my college in NC for a whole month in June because I resented everyone and everything for making me the way I am. I’m also autistic so my brain is stuck on this life I thought I was gonna have with her. 

Ofc I text after  
two weeks and she says she never wants to speak to me again. And at first I went off for good and was okay. I went on a solo trip, I finally had another pics with friends to post there, and I even was happy to go home. I mailed the stuff back she didn’t want too and that felt so relieving. But idk what happened but this past week has destroyed me for no reason. I feel dead. I can’t get out of bed, I have no joy in anything, and the last couple days, I’ve started looking ups ways to end it all. I’ve realized that the pain I have is much worse than the pain of those who’d miss me. I’ve rlly started to actually consider how I would do it. 

I’ve been depressed my whole life, but this is something I’ve never gone deep into. I was happy a week ago after she shut me down. I was happy the two weeks in between our texts when I finally found reason to work on myself. I was actually somewhat content with just being friends for that time I was praying for that bc I just needed good friends. And I have some of them, but everyone is so sick of hearing about her. I have nobody to talk to. And my parents got pissed when I mentioned how I felt earlier on bc my uncle took his life. But I can’t do this. My autism caused me so much social pain growing up. That girl was my escape from it all for YEARS and now it’s gone. And I don’t feel the same around my family anymore. The only thing I can do is cry and long for her back. 

She would always say she loved me more all of these years and stuck by me through it all. But she made a friend in December and when I visited her they texted like crazy. And now she is visiting this female friend in June a 4.5 hour drive and she despises driving. I literally got replaced by a friend. She struggled socially like me but the second she met anyone to take the pain away, she leaves me and now is so happy because I was the one holding her back in life. It’s such delusion. When we briefly texted she said she cried bc she felt bad but who knows.

She has always had trouble facing things and speaking up, so this could be her way of not wanting to know my pain or get feelings for me again. I don’t even think she’s the one who texted the break up. 

So I’m done. I hate my future. I hate my major. And I don’t enjoy my life anymore. Doing the things I love brings me pain. Is rehab an option idek what there is for that but I’m done.

Gender Dysophoria,1716182250.0,"Hey, This might be my final post so I want to recite a poem

In a world of confusion and fear  
A 14 year old with no one near  
Struggling with a truth inside  
Gender dysphoria they cannot hide  
Assigned male at birth, but feeling lost  
Their true identity comes with a cost  
Searching for acceptance and understanding  
In a world that can be so demanding  
They long to be seen for who they are  
Not judged or ridiculed from afar  
Their journey is a difficult one  
But they will not rest until it's done  
With courage and strength they face each day  
Hoping for a world where they can be okay  
Their spirit shines bright, their heart so true  
A 14 year old with a gender anew  
So let's offer our support and love  
To this teen sent from above  
Their journey may be long and hard  
But we stand with them, our hearts unscarred.

"Me being a lying, failing student has ruined me",1716181435.0,"Around early 2022, just after i finished my 9th year during the pandemic, me and my mom were going to move in a few months and enrolling just to leave mid-school year didn't sound like the best plan so mom thought it would be best to enroll me in a fully-online curriculum for the meantime so im still getting educated. 

First 2 months were going great, I was doing my studies and helping pack our things, then suddenly i felt like i couldnt do school anymore (think its called burnout). I was always a top student and me randomly losing interest in studying broke me. 

Everytime i tried to open the website, I felt a sense of shame and disappointment, so I just closed the page and went on with my day, but this also made me feel like total shit. I was in this feedback loop where if i wasnt finishing my studies i felt like shit, but when im about to start i feel like shit. There were multiple days where I felt just ending it, but I kept telling myself that it'll fix itself out. 

Fast forward to when the website locks me out since the time window for completing it has passed, and my mom asks me if i did finish everything, I lied and told her everything was fine. She puts a lot of trust in me and doesn't check up if I was doing my work.

She then asks if I wanted to continue since it would be too late to enroll close to the end of the school year. I agreed, so I spent another few months lying through my teeth to her about my education. I cant seem to tell her as I dont want to break my mom's heart but at the same time I cant keep this lie up.

Now in the present I'm about 1.5months from enrolling in a physical school and she's been asking me for my non-existent report cards. A lie ive built up for 2 years is soon about to crumble and every other day I feel like it would be better to bring this guilt to my grave.

I just don't thinks she sees it. Yes there are bad eggs there but there are good ones too. 

I have always felt overwhelmed that she only relays this to me and when I asked if I can tell her family, she said it would be the ultimate betrayal and would stop being my friend if I were to cross that line. So for the last couple of years, I have kept silent about it until last night. I got a hold of 2 family members that I think truly care about her wellness. After not being able to take it anymore, I snapped. 

She lashed out at me and called me a lot ugly things but the words that stay with me the most is saying that she is going to do it sooner now and I have a part in that happening. I question if what I did was right thing for me to do and has been eating away at me all day.
Her family did thank me for reaching out and are relaying what they can to me about her since she wants nothing to do with me.

the reason i'm going to commit is because of how lonely i am. just under 2 months ago my most recent girlfriend broke up with me. we'll call her Jane. she broke up with me because she had been so busy with school, sports, looking at colleges, and trying to still have a social life. she was only my second girlfriend and we only dated for about 3 and 1/2 months but i felt a real, genuine connection to her. i know that connection is real because i felt closer to her than anybody else ever. i dated my first girlfriend for 8 months and i thought that she was going to be the one but i loved my most recent girlfriend far more than i did the first one. Jane was really the only friend that i had. at school the only people that i talked to were her friends. but now that she's gone ive just felt empty. i don't have any friends anymore. nothing is enjoyable. yesterday at work i saw a friend of one of Jane's friends and decided to text Jane's friend about it because i wanted to talk to somebody. But it seemed like Jane's friend hated me but only responded to be nice. that just reminded me how truly alone i am.
tonight for an hour straight i cried thinking about Jane. eventually the thought of suicide popped into my head. i decided that i was going to make a final attempt it everything was finally going to be over. immediately i just stopped crying and stopped hurting. i read that before someone commits suicide they become extremely calm and i think that is what happened.

I've given everything I have, trying to be part of something, but it never seems to be enough. My efforts go unnoticed, and my voice gets lost in the noise. I've hoped for change, for someone to see me and understand, but that hope has faded. The loneliness has grown too heavy to bear, and I can't keep pretending everything is okay when it's not.

Made first post and deleted; Brave enough to repost.,1716166027.0,"Long story warning.

I made a long post about getting a pet or ending things. I received a positive comment and had decided; a pet it was. I do very well when I have an animal companion. My previous PTSD support pet ( He was a bird so legally classified as a pet) recently passed. Bad news; just spoke to the property owner. No pets; no exceptions.


TL;DR I have PTSD and live alone in an isolated area. I prefer this and self regulate well on my own. I'm also a physically disabled adult who basically lives and works from home. In rare occasion to leave because my house is adapted to my disability. No friends and no support system. I don't have anything against friends. It's just the lifestyle; sparse social choices paired with being the ""annoying disabled person"" as I've been called means I don't find social situations much. I was happy with my lifestyle. There isn't some rule that says you have to have friends and be social. I'm nice to people in passing and just keep to myself. I was as happy as someone recovering from PTSD could be. I stay in touch with the world; I have internet (obviously) just at my own pace. 


An abusive parent just moved in against my will. Legally I can't have them move out; complicated situation I can't resolve. Nor can I leave because of aforementioned disability. 

Now, I struggle with daily suicidal ideation. I'm afraid of this person because they intensely trigger my PTSD. Treatment is unavailable here. I'm in a weird predicament. 

I don't know any other way to ask. How do I cope? 

I've dealt with similar symptoms in the past, when my trauma was fresh. This is worse. I'm struggling to eat. The common taking it one day at a time isn't working anymore. 

I've been threatened in other support groups in the past so I feel I have to say this. I don't have any concrete plans yet. But I do wake up everyday with the intense desire to end things. I'm tired and I'm scared. 

I don't want to be arrested and hauled off to a rubber room. I want to get better. I just don't know how. ",LeanoreLovecraft,,False,1cw32ls,5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cw32ls/made_first_post_and_deleted_brave_enough_to_repost/

Idk anymore ,1716165800.0,"I'm currently in court proceedings because social services took my family to court because I asked for mental health support after my son was born. 
This was in Feb BTW 
Lately my wife has been going on about divorce so at least one of us are with our son (social services think I'm going to kill my son because of my mental health) but she won't listen when I tell her it will mean I won't be allowed to be in both there lives 

So we get on to the problem of the day (19th of may) she's at her sister and had weed, she messaged me saying I need to go find some girls online and flirt with them because and I quote ""get a gd time"" from one of them (she's been messaging a handful of dudes that have openly admitted to just wanting to fuck her one being an ex that raped her that she's going out drinking with soon)
We go back and forth for hours and I eventually just ask 
""Are you giving me a free fuck pass because you feel guilty or because you want one in return"" and she said both 
We again ho back and forth but this time arguing and it ends on ""goodbye[wife's name] I think we need to talk about this properly when your not high, I think you should stay at your sisters tomorrow"" but then she goes off on me saying ""fuck you thennnnnn, just fuck off already if you want to leave so bad"" 

I don't know what I've done and how to fix it
I don't want a divorce, I want my family but do I still have a family anymore? If she feels guilty and wants a free fuck pass did she flirt too hard with someone and catch feelings? Does she even love me anymore 
I'm nothing without them and sadly that's not even being dramatic, everything in my life since I met my wife became centred around her, once my sone was born (this year jan) it was all about them 2, I've burnt so many bridges with family,friends I even quit work because she disliked my manager.

An argument for suicide,1716163494.0,"I cant feel pain if i dont exist. I would much rather have never been born but beggars cant be choosers so i might as well make do with the next best alternative. I have existed for 21 years, i have no prospects, no close confidants aside from the one person whose heart i broke and in turn broke mine, and no sense of direction or motivation. I made a choice i thought would protect her from pain and disappointment, and ended up causing so much pain and disappointment she could no longer bear the idea of being with me. She could no longer see a future for us. We had spent so long discussing possible futures, destinations, careers, even fucking pets, and in one moment i ruined that reality, or possibly rather revealed its unreality. If she couldnt accept me at my worst, most shameful state, did she deserve to see me at my most proud? If there is a God he, she, or whatever fucking pronouns they use are a cruel manipulator on a cosmic scale. 1.5 years may be a blip in the eyes of some master creator but im barely 2 decades old and this shit has been a massive fucking chunk of my life so far. I know theres other people, i know the key to happiness is working on myself, but why should i even fucking bother when all i want is to devote my life to her? Some find solace in religion, praising and worshipping whatever deity some guy thousands of years ago pulled out of their fucking ass and maybe that brings them peace. I wish it did for me. I wish i was able to keep believing that some guy in the sky created an entire race of sentient beings out of fucking dirt and then somehow had a son with one of these dirt gremlins for the sole purpose of this son dying ‘for the sake of our sins’. I wish so badly this made sense to me. Maybe then i could direct all my energy to that and find purpose in it. But i dont. And i cant. It just makes no sense to me. Id rather put my energy and soul into someone i can perceive, after all perception is the only confirmation of our reality. I cant see some sky daddy up in the clouds, but i can see her. I worshipped her, i praised her. If there was a God it took shape in her. They say he made us in his image but the only proof of that i can see is corrupt, selfish, and altogether destructive to itself and the world he supposedly created for it to foster. If we are the image of God then he is a vile, ugly, sadistic being. I remember learning in school about tragedies, and their main defining trait is that they revolve around the downfall of the protagonist due to a flaw of their own they were unable or unwilling to overcome. Humanity is a fucking tragedy. The only animal cursed with the knowledge that we are slowly decaying. What kind of existence is that? Im supposed to find purpose knowing im just a sack of atoms with an unknown expiry date? How do i live knowing everything and everyone around me will not only cease to exist at a certain point, but if our mess of a species manages to make it into any sort of distant future, most of us arent even likely to be remembered? I hate sentience, i hate existence, and i hate pain. I hate the way my heart aches when i see her. I cant seem to escape this prison of affection she has me in. i hate that i let myself be so vulnerable and then hurt her so badly she can no longer be vulnerable with me. I worked so fucking hard to earn her trust. It was a fucking grueling experience. And i would do it all again if given the chance. The looks of mistrust turning to a deep reliance, as i slowly peeled away the layers to her soul. She used to describe her trust as eggs she was putting in my basket, and the day she said i had all her eggs might have been the most loved i ever felt in my life. 2 weeks ago she told me i broke one of her eggs, and she had to take them back now to protect them. I dont think ive ever felt so much pain and remorse as i did in that moment. Not only for hurting the person i cared about most, but because i have to live with the fact that that unreality we had built together would stay that way, and it was all on me. I hurt her, and i hurt myself. I know theres probably someone out there with more shared interests, with more quippy one-liners, possibly someone im even more attracted to physically. But i just dont fucking care. What point is there in chasing that when it could all get fucked like this? I cant do this again. I wont do this again. Its too much. I think i might be done. One of these days i might finally get the fucking balls to do it. ive been so scared for so long. The afterlife, my family and friends, her. But fuck it. My parents see me as the problem child, and they wouldnt even be fucking wrong. My siblings barely know me and i barely know them. Visiting home is like a hotel where im constantly reminded of how much of a failure i am and all the ways everyone around me is better. And im genuinely not even jealous. I could care less about any of my cousin’s lifestyles, or my sisters much better academic performance and artistic skill, or my brother’s athletic prowess. I really am happy for them, they all deserve it and more given the work theyve put in. The only thing i give a shit about is the fact that i get treated less because of these things. I just want to be able to live my life without being put down for choices that im happy with. I just want genuine fucking support, and when i fail to not have it shoved in my fucking face as if i dont already feel like enough of a shit sack. I dont need a 6 figure salary i need a fucking support system. A small but significant part of me holds a deep resentment for my parents for actively choosing to bring me existence. When i get the fucking chance i might just have to take that existence into my own hands and strangle it away, but for now im too much of a fucking pussy to try. I dont even know how id do it. I want it short and painless, almost instant if possible. I dont want any chance of survival in the form of life support, so maybe looking into a dnr would be useful but i dont even know where to start with that. Ive heard of a trick with the car exhaust, but i dont own a car and i dont want anyone finding my dead body in their vehicle. I just want an easy death, life has been hard enough. I feel like im tipping over the edge

On the brink like never before ,1716158389.0,"These past few weeks have been emotional torment for me that's hard to even put into words. I just can't keep up with it any longer.

I'd like to think I was close to finally doing it two or three times already in the past two years, but right now I'm on the very edge. Closer than ever before. Doing hour long, active research on a plethora of different methods, only to come to the conclusion that there's no easily available, fool proof method that doesn't bear the potential risk of leaving you even worse off than before. Leaving me in even more desperation. Right now it's really effing tempting to just run straight into the nearest train or jumping off somewhere. Or if all else fails just grabbing a belt and trying my luck. Just taking that risk of ending up crippled or braindead. It's that unbearable.

I'm so insanely drained and tired, all the while this constant inferno of intense emotions blazes right beneath my skin. A viscous cocktail of anger, wrath, sorrow, loneliness, hopelessness and so much more, some of which I can't even describe myself at times.

I'm 29 and would consider myself a very attractive and charismatic young man with, even more importantly, a genuinely good heart and character. You'd think I should have no problems attracting potential partners and being in the prime of my life. But here I am, ever only having truly loved a single girl that I just can't get over. It's been 1.5 years and I'm still nowhere near capable of letting her go. Her very being I fell so endlessly in love with, forever etched into my soul. You could line up 100 of the worlds ""most beautiful"" women right in front of me and I'll escape into my thoughts and think about her instead. About how I loved everything about her with every fiber of my being. How she was the only thing apart from my early childhood, that's ever made me feel joy. The only person that ever made me feel loved. As if losing her wasn't enough, seeing her move on as if nothing ever happened between us, is what truly gives me the rest. All the things that were said between us. Words that are supposed to carry a lot of weight but ended up being nothing but thin air.

I guess most of you cherish every second of sleep you can get, and I'm no different. But I'm at a point where I even have recurring nightmares about her and how she moved on.

Waking up is already a burden. Coming to that realization, a few seconds after opening your eyes, that the suffering now keeps on going. And now I'm even tormented in my dreams...

Back then we were pretty sure she's got BPD. Now I'm wondering if perhaps I was the one afflicted with it all along. Or perhaps we both have it, and we're just on different sides of the spectrum. Whatever, doesn't matter now anyways...

I don't even know why I'm posting this. I do think it helped damping that emotional inferno at least a tiny bit, but I know it isn't going to last. It never does.

Thanks if you took the time and read through it.

I'm a nobody, I'm not good at anything, I put some effort in but it's never enough, everyone is smarter than me, I spend 9 hours in school, and all the time I'm home I'm either doing basic necessities or I'm studying yet I can't fucking get an easy question right, WHY WHY, FUCK.

 I am not sure for how many more months or years I can keep going on like this. Almost all nights I come very close to trying something stupid (I won't say it but you know what it is considering the subreddit we're in), if I lived in a big city with trains and skyscrapers and wasn't such a pussy as well I would have already done it ages ago, I hate myself so much God
                                                                                      
 People online tell me to get help, but the mental health professionals that work in my city's public healthcare center from what I've heard, I'm better off away from them, and my school's therapist the two times I told him such personal things to me like my past suicide attempts and my transness he basically told me ""That's rough buddy, feeling bad feels bad, doesn't it? Why don't you come to my clinic later for us to talk about it?"". THAT DOESNT FUCKING HELP ME, THAT'S MARKETING, IF I HAD MONEY TO GO TO A THERAPIST I WOULDNT NEED YOU FOR GOD'S SAKE.

I'm just about done with life,1716151608.0,"I'm 16 and I feel so alone. I'm trapped in the house 25/8. I'm homeschooled and have no job or friends, so even if I could, I have no reason to go outside. My parents are strict. They control 98% of my life. I'm the only girl and the oldest so all the responsibilities fall on me. I can't make mistakes. I'm supposed to be perfect.

I have to be responsible for my brother. Set a good example. Be a good role model but I don't have good role models. I don't look up to my parents. My parents are terrible role models. They hate each other and their life and they are not afraid to tell us. They always argue and most of the time it is physical. Things are constantly getting thrown and broken. They don't care how it affects us. They are always using me to vent about each other. I have to hear my parents say they want to kill themselves and they hate their life and want to leave.

My brothers copy their behavior and do the same things when they get angry. I babysit them as my ""job"" when my parents work and when I ask them to do something they don't want to do, they throw things, hit, punch, scratch, scream at me. Sometimes they scratch or bite so hard I bleed. Do I tell my parents? No. Why? Because I don't want to add more drama to the house. I don't want my brothers to get in trouble either. I don't want to get in trouble because ""I should have just left them alone"".

My brothers do absolutely nothing. They sit on their tablets all day long. You ask them to do something and it is almost always a no. My parents don't do anything about it. They are always complaining about how they don't help out around the house but they just let them sit of their tablets.

I didn't really have a childhood. I sat inside all day long. When I did have friends I couldn't do anything with them. I didn't have sleepovers, go to birthday parties, school dances. Nothing. I couldn't text or call because I didn't have a phone. I got my first phone when I was 15. Before that I had an app for like 10 year olds and my parents monitored that too. (I was 15 when I was allowed to have the app and a month or two later I got my phone. I also only have family members, no actual friends.) Now I have an actual phone and still am only allowed to have family members.

My 10-year-old brother is allowed to talk to his classmates on a game. He can text them. (we are all homeschooled and my parents do not know the kid or their parents.) (This was always the reason I was never allowed to do anything when I was in actual school.)

I can not express how jealous I am of my brother. I hate myself for it. But why does he get to talk to his friends but I can't? My brother is constantly getting in trouble for lying about things too. I do my best to be well behaved but I still cant talk to people without my parent's permission. I don't have any kind of social media. I asked for discord (because everyone in my class has discord and was using that to talk to each other) so I could add people from my class but I can't do that.

We don't talk about feelings in my family. My parents can't have a proper conversation with each other without screaming at each other. So what does that tell me. I keep everything inside. I have to deal with mom, dad, and my brothers drama. I don't have anyone to tell their problems to.

I cut myself to cope. I recently relapsed after not cutting for 2 months and it's been hard. My parents don't know I cut or that I'm suicidal. I sit in my room and cry then go down and act like everything's fine and put on a fake smile.

I am really starting to hate my parents, and my brothers. My brothers are only copying what they see but I try to explain to them not to copy mom and dad but they still do. I am the one always getting hit, kicked, bit, stractched, screamed at, called names. But I can't react. I can't hit them back. Call them names. They don't deserve it. But neither do I.

I keep telling myself, if I every become like my mom or dad I will actually kill myself. I would hate myself if I am the way my mom and dad are. I may already be like them. My mom always tells me I'm like my dad when I do something wrong. And my dad does the same. They don't realize how much that gets to me.

I try so hard to be grateful. I know people have it worse. But I don't deserve this.

I always think about how people may react if I died. Like would they actually be upset or just not care. Maybe they would be happy. I'd be out of the way. Stop annoying people.

I don't know how much longer I can hold on. I keep telling myself to hold on for my brothers but they don't care about me.  No one actually cares about me and I can tell. No matter how many times they say they do, they really don't. If they cared they would see that I'm struggling. They would see my scars.

I'm surprised i'm still here,1716151769.0,"I don't know if I should feel bad about what i'm feeling since I feel like others have really bad stuff going on too. but I need to get it off my chest. 

I (m22) don't wanna be here anymore. and I have that for a while now. where every fucking day, you just wanna die. life has always been very challenging since I was a kid. had a bunch of shit happen. one of them was the problems at home (i'm really sorry if this is gonna be a long post, might not). One problem I had was with my mother. always struggled getting love and affection from her whilst I always did my best. especially in the days where she was suicidal. 

so long story short, I missed a positive loving mother(figure). 

last summer I met someone who became that person for me. We met on a special day and our bond grew very quickly. I finally felt happy for once in my life. someone that said she wanted to adopt me. someone who I felt loved with, someone that spoke that I won't be alone anymore. and it all went to shits. it's a really long story, and a difficult one to explain. she's not in a good mental place either. but I don't get how you can say all these things, and that I don't have to worry about her leaving or etc etc. and that it doesn't add up to what's been said. I feel alone. I feel ignored. and these past months (this has been going on since okt) she was my mom ffs. I was her kid. how can you say all these things when in a blink of an eye it's all changed. that all of a sudden it's not like that anymore. it fucking kills me, and now i'm the idiot that has to change and accept it again. like always. losing the people you love the absolute most. then being told that you need to find happiness within yourself and love yourself more. I say bullshit! 

it's not about loving myself more. i'm the only person I have. tf you mean. the only person I had was ME!! it's not me that I hate. I hate life, I fucking hate it with a passion. whilst it can be so damn beautiful. but I don't wanna live this life. I don't wanna figure it out alone. I just wanted to be with the people I love. I feel left behind.  and every fucking day I wish that I die. I'm too fucking scared to do it myself, but fuck me do I wanna hang myself. I just can't do it. but pretty much everyday I hope someone could do it for me, drive by and shoot me, hit me with a truck or whatever. today it was lightning since it was storming and I was outside. just fucking get me if you like to bring me down all the time! finish the job. no I have to finish the dirty work. cuz that's how life is. keeps bringing you down over and over again, until you either can't take it anymore, or you'll live with it. yeah well fuck that, I don't wanna live with it. I hate it. 

people talk about how I should focus on school or something that makes me happy -\_-  
bro... I JUST WENT THROUGH 7 MONTHS OF PROPER FUCKING HELL! you think I give one single shit about school!? well I don't. because why tf would I. I care about the connections I have in life. AND THEY KEEP FUCKING ME@!!!@!@ and i'm angry. i'm sad. and I just wanna close my eyes and leave this world.

oh yeah, not to forget that I cannot talk about this with that woman. because she'll probably stop everything we still have. she's still in my life and she told me everything will be the same apart that I can't call her mom. well it's not. like I said, I feel like i'm being ignored. and that i'm becoming a stranger to her. just one of the people she knows. while at first I was a child to her. it hurts man. I can't tell her that I miss her. and I just have to wait. wait for her to msg me to hopefully meet again soon. but it's been 3 weeks again. 

Fuck people man. and the fucking struggle is that I love her. I can't say go fuck yourself and be on my way. I fucking love you! but this is hurting me and if I say that she'll be gone! 

Can I please just sleep and not wake up. please? can someone just please do it for me. i'm a bitch when it comes to that. But I genuinely don't wanna carry on anymore. not just because of this. just everything man, fucking everything. i'm hurt. and the people irl that are involved with this don't get it (which are a few and a lot has happened too). you just took my mom away and say I have to deal with it basically. cruel. that's what life is, it's fucking cruel. 

  
i'm sorry for this rant. probably written very confusingly. but I just don't wanna be here anymore. and it's such a struggle to be stuck like this every fucking day. to go on when you don't even fucking want to.

My life is over,1716156270.0," 

I was molested a few times and SA’d in 7th grade and I’ve been depressed ever since. And i ruined my life. I wasted my teenage years. I never went anywhere. All I did was stay home because I couldn’t bring myself to leave the house. My grades tanked and never recovered. I graduated but barely. I was always in the counselor’s office because I was so depressed and would frequently breakdown in class. It was so embarrassing. I’m still embarrassing.

College came and everything got worse. My grades sucked because I was too depressed to do anything. I got put on Academic Probation and, even though I tried everything I could, I know my grades won’t be enough and I’ll be dismissed. And that will be one my record forever.  Other schools won’t even accept me. There’s nothing I can do anymore. I used to be so smart when I was younger and get good grades and idk why I ended up like this. I’m a disappointment to all of my family and an embarrassment to my mom. 

I can’t do anything. I try and I can’t. It’s like nothing I do is worth it. I just feel so disgusted with myself all the time. Even when I speak my mind and try to make my life better it’s like im doing something wrong. In August one of my friends killed themselves, one of my other friends attempted, and then another attempted and succeeded in Mid April. It just feels like life has gotten so much worse since they died. I miss them so much. And it hurts everyday it hurts 

I got into a fight with my mom a few weeks back because I told her how I felt when she insults me and makes me feel like im a disappointment or how what she says hurts me , and she called me ungrateful and a bunch of other things. All I asked was for her to be nicer to me because after she got married to my step-father it’s like she doesn’t care about me anymore and acts like she would prefer if I wasn’t around. She’s gotten so much meaner. But I am a disappointment. I am and I will always be I know that.

I got into a fight with my friends over something ridiculous (me not wanting to play a game because I just didn’t feel like it) and they said some like genuinely hurtful things to me and it made me realize how they really felt about me. I haven’t spoken to them for like 3 days.

I’ve been planning on killing myself. I tried last April by overdosing on Abilify but it didn’t work (obviously). I don’t have any other options anymore. Things would be better if I died. I’m scared because im afraid of it hurting but it won’t really matter much . I’ll hang myself. It’s the only thing I can do anymore. There’s nothing out there for me and there never was 

I think this is all I can do for the people around me. There’s nothing else. I wish I could say sorry and fix everything I did wrong in the past but I can’t. I can’t do anything. All I can do is cut myself and pray things will get better but nothing ever does . It’s like none of my prayers get answered. When my mom and I fought she said it was because God was punishing me because I did something bad but I don’t know what I did. I just feel so sorry that God made me and i ended up like this. I’m sorry to my mom and to all my family members that i ended up being born and growing up to be a disappointment i wish i was better

A cry for help that’ll probably reach no one,1716152870.0,"Hey all, far and near

I’m a queer 22F who resides unemployed in Ohio, until the past few years, my life has been relatively decent for what I do and do not have. I used to work really hard and try to get what I want to the best of my abilities, although it’s difficult as hell, I try. 

I was on top of not only school, but work as well, I was so certain I’d be a great individual and grow up to do amazing things, to be rightfully in the shadow of my hardworking parents. To get the chance to get out of this shit hole of a state, make a name for myself, become successful, meet a wonderful woman, start a family, the typical American dream.

Everything was as peachy as it could be for someone like me, then I graduated from high school in 2020, everything went downhill so fucking fast. I lost my job, had to finish the rest of my courses online, really rough end to my senior year because of Covid 19.

Then later that same year, I started going to college, I was doing good until I met my ex. 

I was taking so many classes, I was going full time, so why would I take any less classes? It’s not like I was working.

To sum it up, she sucked up so much of my god damn time that I started to be academically dishonest, I went to community college to study computer science. 

Fast forward to spring 2023, I don’t know what the fuck I learned, my ex is still being a pain in my ass, my dad fucking dies, and I haven’t held a job since 2022 (worked retail as a cashier briefly).

Fast forward to today, I’ve been unemployed for well over 2 years now, I can’t get a job in my field, and as if it wasn’t enough, I meet a chick who is from the west coast who I love more than anything on the planet.

I want to restart, I want to be successful with dignity, make enough money to support her and myself, but she’s in an even worse situation than I am, we’re both fucked. Bonus points since she’s way older than I am.

I am fucked

I want to do cybersecurity to try to salvage the little bit that I do know and the knowledge I’ve acquired while getting my associate’s, but it all feels fucking impossible. And even if I do, it seems like IT is eating shit as an industry right now. Now everyone is saying to stay AWAY from IT the moment I graduate (fun!)

I do not feel hopeful, by the time I do anything I’ll be close to my fucking 30s making shit pay and being behind everyone else, and I’m sure my current interest will move on too since I will not be independent fast enough.

At this point, a bullet through my skull is better than whatever this is.

Life is completely uninteresting and there's no reason why I should be alive,1716152160.0,"I dislike the concept of life. Literally everything about it is absolutely boring and uninteresting, even the most minor things. I find it burdensome to need to eat multiple times a day, drink water, piss, poop, etc. I don't like how we just spawn into existence and have no control of who our parents are. If they're shitty people, well too bad. If they gave you some hereditary disease, well too bad. I don't like the system, and I don't like how everyone is just completely brainwashed by the system. I don't like how I just spawn into existence without my control, and now I'm forced to be in a rat race, having to compete just to get money to afford my existence. I don't like how everything in life revolves around money. I don't like people. I don't like how life is just a bunch of suffering, physically and mentally. And the thing is, there's no reward for any of this. Once it's over, we just go back into a non-existent state, just like before we were born.

I don't think life is very interesting at all. I don't think going to school, or spending 50 years of my life selling my soul for a corporation is very interesting. That alone is the majority of your life, for 99% of the population. I don't have any hobbies or passions, because nothing is interesting. I don't have any desire or interest in sex/relationships, because I'm aromantic/asexual. I don't find the selection of things life offers to be interesting at all, which is why I don't have any hobbies. Being a human is a very boring experience. We can't do cool things like animals, such as flying, running fast, or swinging on trees, etc. We're just boring humans that live and sleep in concrete boxes, and when use a metal box to go to our slave jobs, and then back into another concrete box for our slave jobs. Yeah...very fun..

So life is not only terrible because of all the suffering and randomness, but it's also completely boring and uninteresting. There's a whole universe out there. with things that you could never even imagine. Yet I am stuck in a life like this as a mere human being. I don't think there's anything wrong with me for saying these things. The thing is, everyone is just brought into this world randomly and we're all expected to just accept life for the way it is. It doesn't matter what cards we were dealt, what kind of suffering we've been through, or even if we just flat out aren't interested in human life. We're just told to live, but why? I already know people will be talking about how I have depression, but that really just proves my point. People are brainwashed to think with this black and white mentality Again, not everyone cares about this game called life. It's something I was forced into. It's not a game that I asked to play.

I guess I just kinda need to vent. On April 21, 2024 I attempted suicide. I failed at it, obviously. The first 2 weeks were great, I felt on top of the world and I felt grateful to have had a second chance, but I also felt remorseful that it didn’t work. I feel guilty for what I’ve done to my loved ones. They say it’s ok, and that they understand. I joke about what happened because I don’t want them to worry. I promised I’d ask for help if I felt that way again. I’m working towards counseling and have a case manager  But I feel even more guilty because the truth is, I want to try again. 

I don’t want to be here. I’ve spent my entire 22 years of life feeling lost, feeling like a burden. I feel unlovable. I feel like I’m on the outside looking in on my own life. I want to escape myself. I want out of my head. I’ve tried meds and counseling in the past and none of it seems to work. I wonder if maybe I like being miserable. Happiness feels foreign to me and when I am happy I feel like my reactions are faked or cringey. And what did I do to deserve to feel good anyways? I don’t know. Maybe venting will help 

I just know that I have a better plan for this time around. I’m not quite ready to let go yet. I. Want to see my little sister, my favorite cousins, and love on my girlfriend just a little more.  

It almost makes me happy because I can do all of this, I can completely fill my life with love for a few more weeks and not have to worry that I’ll be alive to see the happiness end. I can’t handle change if I’m honest. There is a comfort in it all. 
And I know this is selfish. I know it is. Bt I cannot accurately describe what it’s like in my head and body. The constant worry, the constant fear, the other voice in my head

I’ve been battling BPD and autism my whole life and I can’t do it anymore, I have a really good support network and mental health team but I know I will never recover. I’ve been suicidal since I was 11 and it’s only gotten worse. I’ve lost 3 friends to suicide in a year, 3 family members have died and I’ve been sectioned in hospital about 6 times over 3 years. I’m tired of this cycle. I no longer wish to recover because I have no purpose in life. I’m so tired",InterestingFocus7785,,False,1cvxakj,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cvxakj/third_time_lucky/
(Throwaway account) Considering to kms the day before my 18th birthday.,1716150626.0,"I have always been a shut-in. Very few to no friends, no romantic experiences, people at school take advantage of me, I'm overweight, have a weird personality, am probably autistic and my parents only love the idea of the ""perfect grades daughter (Spoiler: I'm a boy)"" they have of me. They forbid me to see my only irl friend because ""It his fault that i'm turning into a tomboy"". 

Anyway, this has little importance. I feel like I'm wasting my teenage years (""Oh wAntiNG tO kIlL yOUrseLf fOr tHat iS DumB"" Stfu let me finish.) by staying closed up in my room. On the 31st of July i'm turning 18, i won't be a teen anymore. and so i WILL have wasted my adolescence, and i know my birthday will be miserable. Here where i live, your 18th birthday is supposed to be ""the biggest party of your life"", but it won't be MY birthday, it will be MY PARENTS' birthday, because they missed theirs. They decided how i will dress, they decided who to invite (Literally, only THEIR friends and a few relatives), they decided the location, they decided EVERYTHING.

Btw this is not the reason for me wanting to die. I just wanted to explain why i chose to kill myself that specific day LMFAO

I probably won't tho, I'm too scared of pain lol",XxSinking_HeartxX,,False,1cvxl8y,3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cvxl8y/throwaway_account_considering_to_kms_the_day/

My partner died in January and I don’t want to be here either,1716150083.0,"Let me start by saying I’m not going to do anything, that choice got taken away from me as I’ll go into but if someone is actively about to do something they need their post reading more.


My partner killed himself in January, I had no idea it was going to happen. No one did, didn’t show any signs. No one even knew he was depressed. He was struggling with a cocaine addiction which I found out since he died was a LOT worse than I knew about but we had a plan to get him off it. I didn’t realise it had spiralled as much as it had, I can’t believe I didn’t. I find it hard to believe now.

We have a child, he was 8 months old at the time he’s now 13 months next week.

I’m fucking drowning. I’ve had to go back to work as he was the one who brought money in, there was no other family to help. It was just us 3, now it’s just me and our son. I love him so fucking much but I’m exhausted. Even when I’m at work I’m on edge because if anything happens to him at nursery I am the only one who can get him. I never get a break. Work is as close to a break as I get. He’s in that can’t turn your back for a second stage or he’s going to find the one dangerous thing in the room guaranteed. 

I already had post natal depression, grief for him ontop of his has wrecked me. All my energy goes into our son, there’s nothing left for me to look after myself.

They think I’ve skin cancer too, it’s completely treatable so I shouldn’t even be stressed but really cancer? Ontop of everything else? Even treatable I don’t fucking need this right now.

I don’t want to be here, the only time I feel happy is when our son does something then that happiness is crushed by ‘I’m here alone seeing this’. Honestly when it got out he died I think people were shocked it was him that died not me, especially by suicide. I’m the one with fucked mental health, scars all up her arms and legs, spent time in psych units etc. he was the happy, lively, extroverted, didn’t understand anxiety one. If it wasn’t for our son I’d be gone 100% but I can’t have him thinking both my parents killed themselves, what’s wrong with me when none of this is to do with him. He’s the one right thing in my world.

I‘m Stuck. I hate it here but there’s nowhere to go,1716148046.0,"Today I slept in and woke up to a voice message from my mother telling me to come downstairs and iron my clothes. This ruined my day before I even got up… like had she asked me to iron my clothes it would be something different, but I’m a mid 30yo woman who had to move back home after failing out of uni and being unemployed during the pandemic. Now I’m doing trade school and obviously have not enough to move out. 

So maybe I was a bit mopey while ironing my clothes, so whatever. It’s not like I had planned to clean up upstairs because my bedroom is a depression den and I hate it here and I was actually motivated to get some cleaning up done. But no, she had to ask what’s wrong and I told her it’s nothing but she kept bugging me until I said something and she blew up in my face about how if I had any control of my life she wouldn’t have to tell me how to live my life and how amazing other people‘s daughters are because they don’t leave a mess everywhere.


I‘m 36yo, barely getting my life back in control, I know I’m a loser, I have nothing. All my friends from uni are pregnant, having kids, starting families and I have nothing.

Why am I even trying to get my life back? What’s the point? I have no home, I am a guest in my childhood room and nothing I do is good enough and I still can’t control how I spend my time. Is it too much to ask for me to get to decide how I spend my weekends? 

All motivation I had has vanished once she threw all these sad facts at me and I’ve been in my bed watching YouTube trying to numb me feelings but now here I am crying and hating myself and my life. I’m too much of a coward to ever do something, but it’s fine. I have nothing and tomorrow I’ll go back to being the numb person who just obeys. So what if I never get to move out. At least I do have a roof above my head. Our cat hates me too, my friends all live their life. I am stuck here and will be miserable forever. That’s on me for being too depressed to finish uni and getting a proper job. Maybe I shouldn’t have quit therapy, but my parents kept bugging me about how long until I’m “normal” again and I couldn’t take it, and the therapist hinting that maybe I need to move out. With what resources?

Just one more year I tell myself. But what I don’t get a job after that one year? What if all my trade school efforts are for nothing?",FailedDaughter_,,False,1cvwlz9,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cvwlz9/im_stuck_i_hate_it_here_but_theres_nowhere_to_go/
