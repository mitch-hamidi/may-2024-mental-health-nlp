I‘m Stuck. I hate it here but there’s nowhere to go,1716148046.0,"Today I slept in and woke up to a voice message from my mother telling me to come downstairs and iron my clothes. This ruined my day before I even got up… like had she asked me to iron my clothes it would be something different, but I’m a mid 30yo woman who had to move back home after failing out of uni and being unemployed during the pandemic. Now I’m doing trade school and obviously have not enough to move out. 

So maybe I was a bit mopey while ironing my clothes, so whatever. It’s not like I had planned to clean up upstairs because my bedroom is a depression den and I hate it here and I was actually motivated to get some cleaning up done. But no, she had to ask what’s wrong and I told her it’s nothing but she kept bugging me until I said something and she blew up in my face about how if I had any control of my life she wouldn’t have to tell me how to live my life and how amazing other people‘s daughters are because they don’t leave a mess everywhere.


I‘m 36yo, barely getting my life back in control, I know I’m a loser, I have nothing. All my friends from uni are pregnant, having kids, starting families and I have nothing.

Why am I even trying to get my life back? What’s the point? I have no home, I am a guest in my childhood room and nothing I do is good enough and I still can’t control how I spend my time. Is it too much to ask for me to get to decide how I spend my weekends? 

All motivation I had has vanished once she threw all these sad facts at me and I’ve been in my bed watching YouTube trying to numb me feelings but now here I am crying and hating myself and my life. I’m too much of a coward to ever do something, but it’s fine. I have nothing and tomorrow I’ll go back to being the numb person who just obeys. So what if I never get to move out. At least I do have a roof above my head. Our cat hates me too, my friends all live their life. I am stuck here and will be miserable forever. That’s on me for being too depressed to finish uni and getting a proper job. Maybe I shouldn’t have quit therapy, but my parents kept bugging me about how long until I’m “normal” again and I couldn’t take it, and the therapist hinting that maybe I need to move out. With what resources?

Just one more year I tell myself. But what I don’t get a job after that one year? What if all my trade school efforts are for nothing?",FailedDaughter_,,False,1cvwlz9,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cvwlz9/im_stuck_i_hate_it_here_but_theres_nowhere_to_go/

Nothing brings me joy, and no one wants to be around someone who is so consistently in pain. Every friend I make eventually tells me my depression is too much and they leave. I've worked non stop to find solutions but therapy meds, exercise, trying new hobbies.. none of it helps or strikes joy. I genuinely only feel happy when I talk to people, but nobody talks to me.

What I want to say but never will. ,1716146854.0,"I am a 22 year old woman who will be entering her senior year of film school. I have been thinking of hurting myself for a very long time. I’ve just always been too afraid. My life has been full of pain, and I’ve done my best to try and overcome it, but it’s just too much. 

My childhood was full of abuse and neglect, which has given me BPD, anxiety, depression, and horrible abandonment issues. I have autism and ADHD, so I’m just a crazy emotional mess with horrible social skills and odd triggers that have to do with the textures of things that touch my skin and food. I’m kinda childish and really high energy when I’m in a good mood (or trying to act like I am), and it typically either makes people smile or annoys them. 

I have skills. I’m a great singer- had lots of training. I was a professional photographer for a while before I started film school, now I’m studying cinematography.  I’m great at it. I’m really good at drawing and writing. My greatest love in this life is music, but my family discouraged me from pursuing it, so I settled on filmmaking since I still enjoy it. I regret not learning how to read music at a young age so I could major in music. I practice by ear. 

I have a couple close friends. I’m not close with my family, but we are on good terms right now. My mom and I had a horrible and abusive relationship, which she has since apologized for and is trying to make up for by helping support me through college. I’m really grateful to her for that because without her, I would be homeless and living in my car. Everyone that really knows me tells me they love me. They all say I’m funny and I’m a sweetheart and they enjoy being around me. I try to be there for the people I love and validate them and just be good to them, especially if they’re good to me, but nothing I do seems to get people to truly care about me. It feels like they all just use me because they know I’ll do anything I can to keep people in my life. They take advantage of my kindness and keep me around for their amusement, kinda like a dog. But when I try to talk to them about how I’m feeling, how I wish one of them could just understand me and how I feel, how I wish I received the same emotional support that I give to others instead of only financial support or support regarding material things, it falls on deaf ears. I know they’re trying. I’m grateful to everyone who has helped me in any way thus far. But I have emotional needs too, and I don’t want to have to pay someone to care. I want the people I love to care. 

I’ve tried therapy for years. I’ve been in and out of mental facilities. I’ve had psychiatric help. I played along, answered their questions, followed the advice. Nothing works. At the end of the day, all I’ve ever wanted in this life is to be truly loved the way I love others- completely and unconditionally. It’s not about what they do for me. I love them all for who they are, and I would do anything for these people. So why don’t they feel the same about me? Why am I not good enough?

 No matter what I do, no matter what I say, no matter how hard I try, I’m never good enough. And no therapy will fix that. I’m just “too much” for people. I’m the person who fades into the background and is only kept around so long as it’s convenient. I’ve lost a lot of friends because I followed my therapists advice and stopped giving myself to people who only wanted to take from me. 

I did everything right. I got help, I took it seriously and did what I was supposed to do. I treat people the way I want to be treated, I communicate my needs, I respect people’s space and boundaries, I validate them, I do my best to be good and to follow all the advice that the mental health professionals have given me over the years. I spent time focusing on myself and bettering myself. But life remains the same. Nothing is fulfilling because I’m still sitting here with a massive hole in my heart. 

Objectively, I know I’m a good person and I don’t deserve to die. I know I provide at least a little bit of value. I love making others happy. I love when others’ interactions with me are positive. I like being like. I just don’t understand why I’m never enough for someone to care, to appreciate me, to listen to me and take me seriously? Forgive me if this sounds dramatic. I’ve been told my entire life that I’m just dramatic and my problems aren’t that bad. 

Why am I not important to anyone? And why should I stick around if I’m just damaged goods and truly don’t matter? 

I’ve heard “keep going” for so long. But why? Why do you want me alive just to treat me like I don’t matter? I feel so alone. 

I’m planning on just quietly disappearing. I’m taking one last trip to the beach with my mom, she’ll be the last one I see. Taking lots of pictures for memories. I wrote her a handwritten thank you letter for Mother’s Day to show her how much I appreciate her help so she’ll have my handwriting. I left one of my favorite jackets in her car so she has my scent, along with my favorite perfume. I’ll drink myself to death and die quietly in my bed. Nobody ever checks on me, so there’s no chance I’ll be interrupted and for once, that’s the way I want it. I’m sure nobody will even find me until my body starts to stink. I just needed to get this off my chest. These are my pure, unfiltered thoughts. I can’t tell anyone in my life these things. 



Thank you all for listening. Goodbye. ",martyrbabyyt,,False,1cvw5zk,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cvw5zk/what_i_want_to_say_but_never_will/

29 just counting the days despite having worked for years to repair my life,1716142549.0,"Wrote up another last note im planning to leave soon.
Like many others I suffered through traumatic things, endured swxual and physical abuse that somehow I still blame myself for (despite logically knowing I shouldnt), maybe in a twisted effort to give myself power. All I ever tried chasing was genuine connection with people but as I unfortunately couldn't properly socialise in my formative years I was always far away from what I saw as normal or ideal. Rapes  harassment and other shit followed, only relationship i had was abusive and violent. 
Somehow managed ar least to get a career going and im just struggling around trying to fix myself and my life. It's always been extremely difficult to make friends or date normal people (seems hardly anyone likes me enough to date me) just burdened by loneliness. I've worked so hard to have a stable life, build routines, take care of myself and i do see changes, even people speak so much more differently about me and see me differently  but none of it warms my heart.
 Seems I can't run away from that classic past of dysfunctional family, negligent father, affected mother, childhood depression bla bla. Worked so hard even going to therapy for so long, all I do is just count the days until that day. I just feel extremely tired I don't even have wishes or visions of my future, I know I can't fulfill my dreams and passions, I know I'll have to stay alone for a long time or even forever.

My mother has developing Alzheimer’s and my father is showing signs of it starting.

I do the cleaning etc in the house while my father spends most of his time in the garden shed smoking and drinking.
He has also started to snipe at my mother when he thinks I can’t hear.
My mother has also started to leave the house late at night and each time it happened she said she was waiting for a lift to go home.
Now the front door is locked but she has her own keys and so I have to wait and listen when I am in bed just to make sure she doesn’t try it again .


I got into a screaming match with my father on Tuesday night , both of us screaming obscenities at each other, the following morning he demanded I leave the house.

I left and spent the entire day walking around the coastal countryside in my town.
later that night I drank a large bottle of vodka while sitting in the nearby woods.

I drank the bottle and then slit my wrists in 4 places. I ended up falling unconscious and didn’t even notice the lashing rain.

When I awoke I realised what I did and went looking for help. 
A complete stranger helped me get to hospital where they were amazed I was still standing.

I was released from hospital yesterday and have booked myself into a hotel.
My parents don’t want me back and only my older brother came to see me.

Not like I’ve been told my entire life to go to the ER when I’m suicidal and that the ward is there to help me. Stupid me for expecting the healthcare system to actually help me or thinking that I’m deserving of compassion or mental stability. 

I’ve been met with nothing but hostility and contempt begging for help while I had my entire life ripped away from me.

While I lost friends and family and everything I owned because no one believed I was actually trying to get help.

While I was stripped of every ounce of dignity and humanity begging for someone to take me seriously. 

Stupid me for thinking that the healthcare system was actually there to help me.

I can’t really write my own prescriptions or I would be. I kinda need a doctor for that.

Can’t really help myself there when every single doctor I talked to told me to go fuck myself.

The closest I can come to “taking control” is self medicating with booze, alcohol, and hard drugs. 

They refuse to listen to me, take me seriously, or medicate me properly, then treat me like worse than Hitler for resorting to self medicating in times of desperation, despite them making it clear that they have no intentions of helping me and that I’m not worth lifting a finger for.

I gave them dozens of chances to help me, and every time I got told to go fuck myself, so they don’t get to chastise me for my actions in times of crisis and despair.

My mental and physical health are both spiralling out of control, and I can’t find a doctor to believe a single thing that comes out of my mouth.

I’m done humiliating myself. I’m done expecting anyone to care. Cause they made it clear they dont.

So all I’m left with is self medicating and praying that my next hit is the one that makes me OD and drop dead.

I don't know what to do anymore.,1716139920.0,"It's hard for me to start this post, but I think first I should mention what motivated me to share this in the first place.

Next week I will turn 24 years old, and I still haven't achieved anything worth mentioning in my life. 
I hardly finished high school, I couldn't make progress in any degree to get a title, I have been dealing with depression since 2018, I never had any true friends in real life, some people betrayed me in traumatic ways, my family don't believe in any of my projects (my father even mocked me to feel better about his purposless life), I can't stand official institutions when it comes to education and learning (because they make me get burned out very easily). 
Also I have ASD (officially diagnosed Autistic Spectrum Disorder) and that made me suffer in many different ways. I have always been an outcast who suffered psychological bullying (and physical to some extent). I have never really understood society and that's probably the main reason why I never had a girlfriend (I didn't even have sex or kissed a girl in my whole life). And all this makes me extremely bitter, it is the origin of my sexual frustration.

Furthermore I have always had poor health. The past 9 months or so have been awful. I suffered a bunch of infections, fatigue from antibiotics, finger injuries (I'm studying piano), food poisoning, insomnia, long lasting shoulder injury, back pain, acid reflux, panic attacks from cannabis and fluoxetine use, etc. I could even talk about my experience with psychologists and psichiatrisys. How I had 5 different useless psychologists (one of them blaming me for sexual harassement I suffered) and how over the years all the psychiatrist I had prescribed a total of 7 fucking different antidepressants, alongside benzos, olanzapine and lamotrigine. 

Idk, it's such a massive pile of shit. I could have written way more, like my alcohol problems, but this is already too long.

I have had serious suicidal thoughts since around 2021. Each year it gets harder to control myself and avoid selfdestructive thoughts and actions (I avoid high places or getting close to the metro for example). I have taken drug overdoses a few times already and it's uncertain what day it will be fatal.

Right now I'm studying the piano degree, but I'm so extremely burned out from it that it is starting to make me hate music. And music is my life.

I used to want to be a scientist or mathematician, but I got so burned out I couldn't bear hear anything about it for 4 years, I hated it. But anyways I'm not good enough for it.

My dream would be to be a composer and create profound pieces of music that expand our human experience. I want to revive the world of classical music and inspire others. Also I would like to make ALL my content public, I hate to give a price to my content or make it unaccessible to people who might enjoy it.
But well, all of us need money to live, so I guess I'm fucked. I can't earn a living from being a composer.

I know this post is a pitiful autistic rant, but I simply needed to shout at the void and rant about most of the thoughts that haunt me every single day.

Oh, and by the way, I did try to have a better mindset and work hard during months. I applied stoic values to my life, worked out, stayed disciplined, I saw the positive in everything that happened to me, I had humour, etc.
But I just can't do it, I feel fucking empty and nothing seems to work in the end.

Now I'm just thinking about if it is worth to keep trying. And if not just plan my last months of life before I end it all.

My friends think this i mean, i dont think this. or at least im 50/50.

Loneliness is an inherent part of the human condition,1716128868.0,"Most people will encounter the feeling of loneliness and probably even hopelessness once in their life.

This has already huge implications. The essence of what I want to say is that we try to connect with others and share our authentic selves, but society has too many taboo topics, which (depending on how long you live/ what experiences you made) will make it or already makes it impossible to properly connect with others.

Of course there will still be interactions. But it will be shallow and will leave you realising that you can't get it from other people.

I'm tired of having to think that I have depression, which means that there is something wrong with the way I think. I'm not the problem, it's that society ultimately makes us depressed. Rampant consumerism, the mistreatment of the ""weak"" (the poor, LGBT+ people, the mentally ill, racism, misogyny, patriarchy, the list is endless). Even when individuals would deny any discrimination, our systems do. If you can't take care of yourself, how are you going to do taxes and make a living? Even when you get money from the state, is simply isn't the same as someone who is lucky enough to work a well-paying job. Society rewards people all the more who are useful and I see that as inherently evil.

Utopia would be a place without Social Darwinism of this form. But this is a fantasy. Utopia is defined as a place that's not real. Giving up on utopia, a characteristic that is associated with depression, is ultimately the best thing to do. Humanity has destroyed itself the most when it tried to achieve unrealistic ideals.

To come back to loneliness. It is a symptom. A symptom of a sick society. It's a reflection of how wrong our society is and always was. Technology and medicine, which make us live longer, all this just makes us realise how insane the idea of ""just being happy"" is.

I reject happiness as a concept. Happiness is a static state. There were never revolutions by people that are happy. Nothing changes when people that are happy. Happiness is functionally speaking a state of conformism. No one should ever strive to be happy. I see it as morally wrong.

This is the end of my silent revolution that this post attempts to symbolise. A revolution which leads to nowhere and ends up suffocating before it leads somewhere. This revolution is a reflection of human existence as a whole.

I can't wake up, I can't even consistently brush my teeth. Every time I open up my Uni textbooks I just want to die. I feel empty all the time, nothing brings me happiness. Whenever I do feel happy, it's only for a moment then I feel a deep solemness followed by apathy. I don't see the point in continuing because no amount of money or any job would make me happy. I can't care for myself so I still live at home, but my existence does nothing but cause arguments.

I'm pretty sure I fell into a romance scam too and was groomed, I've been waiting for my girlfriend (online) to turn 18 so we can video chat and meet up, but she said no. We've been online dating for 6 years, since I was 14.  I don't know what to do because I don't want anybody else, I hate the idea of ""moving on"". I don't even care if she's a 60yo man, I'd rather that than ""move on"". I don't even know if the person I'm talking to and have confided in during all the abuse I've suffered is a catfish... What even is the point anymore? 

I don't want anything. There's nothing out there for me. It's not even a case of I can't get what I want, I just don't want it. Money, fame, power... I could have it all. I'm studying a good degree, I'm very charismatic, I'm a good director/leader... But I don't care which pisses me off even more. 

Why? Just why? I have everything. I have the power to do everything but my stupid brain won't let me be happy about anything. Nothing. The only thing that brings a smile to my face is the possibility of dying and seeing this mundane existence cease to exist. 

The only thing I want right now is to find out if I was being catfished. If anything was real, it probably wouldn't change much... I don't even know how to find out.

I don't know anymore,1716128048.0,"(This might be confusing or have a lot of rambling, and I'm sorry it's hard to understand or has very poor grammar.)

I really just don't wanna live anymore, I've been suicidal since around the ages of 7-8 (truthfully could've been younger since I remember the first time I cut myself I was around 7) And like I've tried everything at this point to be happier but nothing has worked. (I'm 15 now) every time I go into like some sort of episode? You could say I like feel like each one gets worse and worse. Like it went from just like me feeling suicidal and stuff to me like self-harming and acting out ig. I  just can't take it anymore it feels like nobody ever listens to me, I've told my parents, friends, and basically anybody I can about it but it feels like none of them care. I could go on and on about it but gosh it's so much it gives me a headache. Every single friend I feel like I've annoyed at this point, they all seem upset or annoyed with me. I can't tell if they actually are or if it's just me overthinking and going insane basically. Half of my friends have turned on me in some sort of way in the past 4 months, and all the new friends I've made have also turned on me. I don't get it I really don't, I try so hard to please everybody, especially my own friends. I try so hard to be a good friend but they all end up leaving me for somebody else dude. I try so hard to be a good person in general but all I ever got from it was being bullied and stepped all over by everybody. I don't get it I really dont man, everyone ik says I should be nice but when I am, I still fuck up and somebody still gets upset at me but when I'm rude or something they're still upset. I don't know what they want from me dude, I've tried so hard for everything, I genuinely can't take it anymore, I feel like I'm gonna snap or break or smth. I don't wanna treat ppl badly but everybody has atp pushed me to my edge. I try so hard and for what? For nothing. I've been nice all my life and got nothing out of it, I don't get what's the point of being nice anymore when I don't get anything good out of it. Ppl only treat me worse and worse. But every single person who has been an asshole to me gets treated so nicely and everybody likes them. But God forbid I lie fucking ONCE and than you have someone calling me a two-faced bitch and than I lose a friend over it. Why dude why, so many of them are worse than me but nobody cares about what they've done to me but if I ever say smth rude to them I have like 1 or 2 ppl upset at me over it. I hate them all so much.

Truthfully I could go on and on about it and stuff but yk 

Everything has led me back to square 1 which is wanting to kill myself. These past 2 months have made me probably the most suicidal I've been in a long time, if ever honestly. As everyday passes I wanna just take a knife to my throat and end it all since everybody would probably be better on without me. I make no difference for them so why should I even be alive? What's the point of being Alive if I probably make nobody happy. I'm just a stupid waste of space.

A mournful dance as night begins to die
I stand alone beneath a tired, weary sky
Ready for death, but not for goodbye

Life is so fragile - unraveled and torn
Moments of joy quickly covered by forlorn
The end approaches - joyful, ghostly sigh
Ready for death, but not for goodbye

Echoes of laughter haunt an empty hall
Heavy whispers in the darkness call
In every heartbeat, memories come and lie
Ready for death, but not for goodbye

Eyes growing heavy, my days are black as night
Embracing the void, surrendering the fight
And in this stillness, my broken soul cries
Ready for death, but not for goodbye

Darkness deepens and hope frays
Dreams once bright now a ghostly gray
With every step a past I must defy
Ready for death, but not for goodbye

In silence where sorrows whispers blend
I face the darkness, my reluctant friend
Though weary heart longs for the final sigh

I wish I didn't have friends so I could kill myself,1716127410.0,"I'm just so tired of living for the well-being of other people instead of my own. It's my life, I wish I could decide whether or not to keep going based on my feelings and not based on the guilt I would feel at hurting my loved ones. I'm not happy, my life is trending downward in every respect. I don't even think I'll be able to keep these friendships long-term anyway because I'll become too much of a failure and bring everyone down around me, but in the meantime, these people care about me and I don't want to fuck up their life. I know what it's like to lose a friend (not to suicide though) and it's devastating, the grief shattered me for years. I don't want them to experience that. Sometimes I want to sabotage my friendships solely so they can end and I can be free to kill myself without guilt, but I know the process of sabotaging my relationships would also be hurtful to them. 

I'm stuck in this depression-fueled arrested development anyway, watching as everyone gets their life together, finds love, starts their careers, and moves away while I'm just totally stuck in place. I guess it's mostly my fault for not ever really opening up to them, but I don't even feel truly known or seen or understood by my friends. I feel like I'm just playing the character of a good friend for them, and I've done too good a job. I'm loyal, dependable, down to go anywhere, help defuse conflicts, always able to offer them a helping hand or emotional support. I don't want to take that away from them because it can feel so good to have someone always in your corner. I feel like I fucked things up so badly now that killing myself will hurt too many people, but I just don't feel like a real person. 

I genuinely don't want to continue on with my life. I'm terrified of dying in an accident, or becoming sick, but I want this existence to end. I don't see a future for myself where I am happy. I feel like an observer in the world, I watch and I try to play the part of a good human being but I don't feel happy. I don't enjoy things, I haven't in such a long time. I hate myself so deeply I don't think I will ever be able to have a good life for myself. I can help others feel good about their lives but I don't think I will ever truly be happy with my own. I guess now I'm just waiting for my lack of ambition and drive in life to catch up to me, for me to go broke, and have everyone finally, finally leave so I can get it over with. I stopped dating people, I haven't dated anyone in almost five years and it's been lonely but it's been pretty easy to cut that aspect out of my life. My relationship with my immediate family isn't great, so I honestly wouldn't feel too guilty about what my suicide would mean to them, even though that is probably callous to say. I just wish the friendships were easier to cut out. I really do love my friends though and that's the problem, I can't hurt them like that.

When she broke up with me it was in a very demeaning and hurtful way. She downloaded hinge and showed me the guys she was talking to and the ones she wanted to fuck. There had been a lot of emotional and physical abuse directed toward me in the relationship, but I still thought she was the one. Despite all the bad things, she was the best partner I ever had. 

Additionally, she filed for a restraining order against me with baseless allegations that most likely will ruin my career.

I (f30) am unsure how to protect my boyfriend (m39) from my mental health issues. ,1716126125.0,"*trigger warning self harm* Ive been with my current partner for 2 years. We both fell really hard and fast for each other, and our relationship progressed quickly. I moved in with him after 5 months, and from the beginning, we had an internal knowing that we wanted to spend our lives together. 

After we moved in together, however, we went through an extremely rough period. We started fighting all of the time, and for about 9 months I was on edge because I was terrified to do or say the wrong thing. During this time, it seemed like I would offend him or upset him on a daily basis, and our fights would escalate to screaming matches that often involved me sleeping on the floor of our bathroom crying my eyes out. He’d often demand apologies for things I felt were small, and get really upset if I ever tried to explain behaviors or things that I did. I got in the habit of apologizing for EVERYTHING & blaming myself a lot & the apologies never seemed good enough for him. 

At the same time, I had a very traumatic upbringing with unstable parents, and don’t have a relationship with them as an adult. I was also in an abusive relationship a few years ago, and still have nightmares about my ex. My therapist says I have symptoms in line with cptsd. I have lots of friends, but getting close to others is extremely hard and scary for me. I’ve also had regular ups and downs in my mental health. 

During the rough period with my partner, I developed suicidal tendencies and started self-harming. I bounce between anger and guilt continually when I do something that hurts or upsets him, and I am terrified to talk about things that bother me because I’m afraid of arguments. My boyfriend also says that I have a distorted view on arguments, and experience our disagreements as a lot worse than they actually are. Things have improved immensely between us, but I’m still afraid to talk to him, the suicidal thoughts have ended but self harming persists.. I  am actively working on this with my therapist and life coach. I’m also looking into joining a DBT group. 

Fast forward to now and our arguments don’t get NEARLY as bad as they used to, but I’m still having self harm issues regularly because I get so scared to have tough conversations or when I upset him. At this point, we are able to recognize and stop when things escalate, but for some reason I still go between guilt and anger very quickly and end up hurting myself. I’ve broken my hand twice from hitting the wall, and I’ve bruised my face several times. He’s seen it happen and is very disturbed by it (rightfully so), but I can’t seem to stop. It’s like something snaps inside of me & I hurt myself.

I’m watching this take a serious toll on my partner, and I don’t know what to do about it. Part of me feels like I’m ruining his life and he would be better without me, and I live in constant guilt over it. Another part of me is hopeful things will get better, but at what cost to him and the relationship? I’m scared he will stop loving me, or that I’ll have these issues forever, or that I’m inherently broken. 

Can anyone relate or give some kind of advice on how to cope with this & proceed? 

TL;DR I developed self-harm issues after a rough time period with my boyfriend with lots of intense arguing. Our arguments have improved and gotten better, but the self-harm issues persist and deeply hurt my boyfriend. I don’t know what to do & would like advice on how to proceed.

How do I know how serious suicidal thoughts are?,1716116627.0,"I've been having suicidal thoughts since I was like 12. A lot of it is mostly just 'I don't deserve to live' kind of stuff, but I've also had pretty vivid dreams of people telling me I should kms and being happy when I attempted and didn't survive.

I have attempted twice, but I'd try neither methods again since they were so slow and (obviously) didn't work. So I don't think these thoughts are anything to worry about too much.

However, a lot of the time when I think about committing suicide, I think about doing it with a gun. It'd be extremely hard for me to get one here (UK), but if I did get my hands on one- which is possible- I'd definitely shoot myself with it. That's not even a maybe. I definitely would.

I want to get into hunting, but that would probably be dangerous for me because like I said, I'd shoot myself. Maybe not right away, but I eventually would. It's quick, and that's what I want. I want to just leave this world as quick as possible, and not have to deal with all this anymore, and for everyone else to stop having to put up with me.

But how serious is this? I mean, it's unlikely I'll get a gun anytime soon, and all other methods are out of the window*. If I tell a therapist about this, will I just be told to suck it up cause others have it worse than me?

I wish I could talk to a professional about this without getting the police called on me (happened last time, it was terrifying).

*I did recently get a whittling kit, and was heavily considering stabbing myself, but I thought about how hard it'd be (I don't want my family to see my dead body, so I'd have to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night with a knife without getting caught, only for there to be a pretty high chance it'll be unsuccessful) and ended up not going through with it.",oh-no-ok,,False,1cvlr1c,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cvlr1c/how_do_i_know_how_serious_suicidal_thoughts_are/

All comes falling down ,1716114571.0,"My partner and I are being forced to move out by August 1st. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we have very little time to find a new place. In the worst case scenario, my partner has a place to stay with family, but I currently have no options lined up. I had been working in a gig capacity due to some health issues, and this event has forced me to go into overdrive after being unemployed for about a 6 year gap.

While I don't want to dwell on the details, this situation has left me feeling desperate. Public transportation is limited in my area, and without a car (which I can't afford to insure), my options are further restricted.

My current plan is to aggressively apply for remote work positions. Ideally, the job would allow me to make enough to afford rent in NY within the next 90 days. However, I recognize this might be a challenge.

There's a potential safety net – a friend who recently moved to Texas is trying to sell his house in the San Antonio area. He might allow me to stay there temporarily while the house sells. The appeal is the walkable environment and decent public transportation. But there's a big fear: if I relocate, will I ever make it back to NY?

My partner can stay with family, so at least there's that.

Right now, I'm overwhelmed with fear and uncertainty. Every passing day feels like the pressure is building

All of this, and my partner told me she wants a separation so we can work on ourselves

I'm just so fucking tired of life.,1716107105.0,"I wanted to post something regarding my mental health so I made an anonymous account. I am a 15 year old male and honestly there really isn't anything that wrong with my life. Of course I every now and then get yelled at by my parents because I did something wrong, I have trouble dealing with homework, blah blah etc. The typical teenager stuff.

But I occasionally have these moments where I feel so fucking depressed and want to kill myself, not that I would ever do it because I'm genuinely afraid of what will happen after that so don't worry about that for now. I've had small moments of suicidal feelings throughout my teenage years but it's gotten worse as I go through highschool. My life definitely is not as hard as others and I don't do much difficult things in general, but I am so tired of homework, assignments, 4 hours of shitty tutoring every week, some may say I'm blessed, confused on what I'm complaining about since their life is so much worse. Maybe I am. However I'm just genuinely so incompetent in regards to putting in effort, so much procrastination for literally everything, even the things I find joy in. Because of this I get yelled at by my parents because I ""don't put enough effort in"", and when I get a good mark on something they do praise me, but they also go ""you could do better"".

I'm sure they think it doesn't matter that much and that I'm overreacting but it just genuinely makes me so angry because I actually fucking tried on it, only for them to give a small compliment. To be clear I love my parents and I'm sure they love me too. They aren't bad parents either it's just that the way they do it doesn't really mix well with me.

Their wishes for me is to get good grades and reports in highschool, get into a good university and get a good job. It makes sense and I'm not against that, it's just the process of getting there, and the fact that I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do with my life. There's nothing specific I want as a job and the very thought of me slaving away at some average company is something I absolutely don't want. I wish my family was rich or I could redo my life so I had a better chance of becoming something I and my parents would be proud of.

It's bad to do but I also don't want to say anything to anyone, besides maybe my cousin and her friend since they can relate. I probably should get therapy but that's literally saying ""my mental health is kinda shit"" which I don't want to do.

"Well, I’m back. ",1716102524.0,"Yep. I posted here a few months ago ready to die, then had a leave of absence from my job, and started doing a bit better. Now, I have since signed a lease, lost my job, moved out of my mother’s house and started college. Just failed my first college quiz last night and I’ve been having a hard time mentally anyways so that was the last fucking thing I needed. The 4th anniversary of my best friend’s death is on Wednesday and I’m going to visit her grave for the first time. Someone is driving me because they’re worried about my mental state afterwards… but little do they know my mental state right now is bad enough 🤡 I’m a failure at everything, including college. I took out loans to take these fucking classes and now I’m going to fail out of them and have some more debt and no degree to show for it. I hate my difficult, physically strenuous low paying career, and now I see no way out of it. I’ve been taking my meds like I’m supposed to (last time I wasn’t) and yet I’m still here. Things never truly get better, they just get a little less shitty. I’m so fucking tired of life constantly shitting on me when I think things are looking up a bit. I just can’t succeed at anything. Nothing ever goes right. I can’t ask for help because the only person who gives a shit about me truly is my boyfriend and he doesn’t know how to help me or what to say. So why the fuck should I ask for help lol I’ll get sent to the hospital AGAIN and nothing will change. Then I’ll go home and be back in the same position. Idk why I try and honestly I think I’m done trying. Last time everyone here said the Benadryl wasn’t going to work so now I just have to find a better way. Last time I overdosed I ended up on a breathing machine for 8 days, so maybe I’ll just take double what I took then. Can’t bring me back from this amount I hope since they barely brought me back from that. Anyways I don’t even know why I’m posting here I just had to get it out I guess. It’s 3:05am and I’m lonely and tired but I can’t sleep. All I can think about is how I’m such a failure and I’m going to be stuck and in debt for my whole life. Moving out of my mother’s house was nice but now I have to deal with the fact that I have no job, and I’m just picking up shifts through a healthcare agency. So more stress on me if I have to worry about paying my rent. And I can’t get a full time job right now because of school so I have to wait until I actually fail out of this program to get another job that I’ll hate just as much as the last few. I’m so fucking done I wish I would just die in my sleep so I wouldn’t have to figure out a way to handle it myself ",Styro-Throwaway5,,False,1cvigxe,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cvigxe/well_im_back/

I feel trapped into being alive,1716101884.0,"I feel trapped into being alive. I feel so completely tired, overwhelmed and saturated. All I do is cry and feel completely unmotivated, I have no appetite, no interest, I can’t focus or sleep and all I want is to disappear. 

I love my friends but whenever we all hang out I truly feel like my presence wouldn’t be missed so what’s the point. And whenever I try to express just how low I’m hitting, I’m not taken seriously. 

I’m also terrified of “being too much” and burdening and hurting my friends with something that isn’t their responsibility. 

My parents are of no help whatsoever with this because either they don’t take me seriously, they don’t talk about it, they minimise it or they end up spinning the conversation back unto them and their issues. 

I have a little brother that for reasons, I will have to take care of when my parents are older and/or have passed away. My sense of love and responsibility for him is the only thing keeping me here but lately it’s getting harder and harder to hold on. 

I feel trapped into being alive and this last month has been so challenging. I go with a psychologist every week and a psychiatrist and I’m medicated but I still don’t feel better. 

I’m also so completely tired of always falling back into these feelings. My meds start working, things are looking up and then something happens and I fall right back into this feeling of overwhelming tiredness, sadness and desperation. I no longer want to feel like this or feel at all.

May 26 is also my ex fiance/baby father's (had miscarriage, worsened PMDD) birthday. mine is June 1st. i should be 26, so bittersweet. i was got kicked out at 16 into my first program but also my workers put me in a residential program because everyone knew i was serious i was determined to not make it past 16. i feel almost exclusively all i've been thru more trauma, abuse, now me deteriorating health which could be improved if i just had somewhere safe to go. i have a state aided housing funding but can't even focus on finding help too often while she berates me and drains my energy and sends me into states of psychosis/passing out from denying me food or making my ED flare. 

i kept ending up in the ER and even went to an inpatient for a few days (not helpful, most are horrible and i speak from experience since i was 11 of being a ""revolving patient""). i keep ""disappearing"" they've nearly filed missing persons when i leave to entertain the thoughts even when people keep telling me to. i keep praying, fighting, trying to cope but i can't. all i want is to not deal with unending pain and abuse. i want more than anything to grieve safely but just for people to be PRESENT. people know, my psych knows i'll do the heavy lifting i just need people there. hearing no one's voice on end for weeks except the words from my mother, stonewalling, occasional interactions with a new friend, my mins is so overwhelmed it's hallucinating. including folks who care(d) for me in an effort to not feel alone and feel someone's there for me. having your brain hallucinate/the usual flashbacks but woven in with hearing ""i'm proud of you"" ""i love you"" ""i'm here with you"" knowing it's not real but it's just trying to keep you alive throughout the ordeal and dissociation. i know that's a lot, but i have no support or anyone to tell or be present with me i'm afraid. i'm trying not to join my mentor and all the people i love. but i'm exhausted. being dumped on, drained, isolated, and scared all the time is too much. i wake up in agony and fear if i can even sleep. i'm so lonely, tired, angry, and hurt. i can't find a reason to go on. all i wanted to do was maybe have a decent job, be loved, have true friends/maybe a relationship, be a mother, and heal & help others. but i can't see myself even surviving until tomorrow. each second is a struggle. i haven't relapsed in binge drinking, purging, or anything but self harm which mine is already severe and has scars. i was gonna get a tattoo started to cover them. 

i had plans, dreams, aspirations, but i can't see a way out of this and can't exist feeling so alone and hated. i don't even want to truly die after doing so so many times my whole including recently. but i feel there's no way out and keep being told to and that the world would be better without and forget about me. my PMDD and autoimmune is kicking my ass. sick of hearing how resilient i am, platitudes, empty promises or words while all i fucking want/need is someone to be here with me. i don't even wanna necessarily talk. i want joy, pleasure, softness, protection, company. i just need to be witnessed/received. i do it for so many people. hearing how i've saved people, been the only one there, a ""wonderful, loving force"" but then knowing most if i guess not all will use me then dip. that i'm perceived as a catalyst. valued for what i do, not who i am. that no one is interested in knowing, just the using and transaction. but also missing the people who made me feel safe, heard, and alive so much. wanting to reach out. but there is goodness in peopl. i just don't know what to say, if everyone truly hates me, where to find many people. i keep reminding myself people can't help if they don't know. but it's wild, everyone knows. i feel like a dying animal, isolating and preparing to pass as to not stress others or soften the blow i've had some amazing support. complete strangers showing me love and compassion. even my abusers in some capacity. but i'm too tired to scream. my nonverbal issues have been at an all time high. God. i just don't wanna go out like this. at all. i don't know who or how to scream for help. i can't fight alone anymore. i want to rest. one of the attorneys i work with, a new friend, and my HS staff being the only ones currently to make space and time and advocate/support/show up for me. seeing the fear in my eyes, the way they know i can disappear and what i've done to myself and has been done to me. there's truly 2-3 people i wanna see but i don't think they'd wanna. i miss my mentor, my other departed ones, my child i would've had, friends old and new, someone i prayed for/developed a crush on who was a literal angel, and my ex in a way. i would do anything to just see one of them one more time. i can't do this anymore. i can't even sort out or know who to call on or how i can keep going. i'm managing too much by myself while essentially on my death bed/deteriorating. any advice especially about reaching to folksor words of encouragement would mean the world.

"May 19th, 2024, 12:56",1716096478.0,"My birthday, hooray, May 19th. Wow another half year, gone within an instant, fucking appalling. How time can move faster than I can exist is unbelievable, whatever, fuck it, i'm useless. I live vicariously throughout the trenches of Reddit's brain rot and isolate  myself within the walls of my rusted cell, only escaping restraint when I feel like existing. My life is a fucking joke, I'm barely pubescent and my life feels like it's already done, I don't know how much longer I can take. Barely beginning my life and already have a criminal record, pathetic, a disappointment is how you could describe my life. I'm a fucking loser, I just get the short end of the stick every time, every single time in my life, i genuinely can't describe a moment in my life where i didn't. If you're wondering, the charges were for threats against my school, yeah, I'm not the victim, I'm a fucking piece of shit, but I'll still play it. These manipulative, self-centered, downright malicious and utterly foul robots known as the ""Feds"" really fucked my life over, they arrested me, threw me in a cell for a day, made me sign some bullshit forum ""don't be around guns"", ""don't go to school"" yeah yeah, fuck you bums. Yeah I made the threats sure, but then they say shit like ""express your feelings!"" ""talk about your thoughts!"" except what they don't say is that when you do we'll handcuff you, throw you in a police cruiser and refrain you from going to school, so any chance of you ever having a meaningful education or occupation will be utterly erased, so that's great, I'll just be the part-time janitor of a condom factory. That's ridiculous. The teachers at my school always target me, once I got sent to the office and had to work in that miserable cesspool for that day for eating the rest of my chocolate bar I had at lunch on the way outside, unfucking believable, or when I got sent to the office for ""getting in a fight"" some fucking alien headed kid twice my size tried to fight me because I ""was kicking rocks at him"" (I wasn't, the worms in his brain were probably just eating faster that usual). And so I attempted to defuse the situation by asking him what the fuck he wanted to fight for and then eventually walked away. I went to the office because the kid's brother said he would jump me and the office looked me dead in the face and said ""yeah, but you were on the wrong side of the yard"" (this was during covid and there were sides of the yard we had to stay on and yes, i was on the wrong side but that had nothing to do with him antagonizing me and wanting to fight me). Put yourself in my shoes here, some kid you don't know wants to fight you and then his brother says he'll jump you, so you go to the teachers for help and they pretty much just say, sorry lil bro, not today. So, the teachers hate me, the students hate me and everyone expects you to go to school everyday, be on your best accord and not lash out... Do you not think that affects me mentally?

So what’s my next step? 


My dad has been pressuring me to go to the hospital… oh yeah but I got that job I start on Monday, that won’t even begin to help me cover rent this month. So if I go to the actual resources put in to help me, that’s just gonna fuck my life up more? 


Okay then I’ll go talk to someone else, but who? 


I have nobody. My brother lives with me and would rather see me starve in my room than actually help and listen. My friends all left me because one of them was abusive to me, is dating another one of them, and they just bought up every word she said about me and turned their backs on me. So who could I call?

To my relatives reading this I want you to know that the reasons I'm doing this have nothing to do with any of you or anyone in particular, I am very greatful for all the support I've received over the years, I'm just tired of existing, I'm tired of living, no matter what I do ever since the day I was born there's always some shit going on, whenever I think I'm going to have peace a new random shit happens, it's been like this ever since the day I was born and I've come to realize that it'll stay like this forever until I finally pass away in PEACE.

I've already been living for more than 30 years, it's enough, I'm tired I'm just done, I did everything I wanted, I have no regrets(not even the bad decisions), I apologize deeply for any pain/suffering or unexpected consequences my absence might cause but I do not wish to participate in this ""thing"" anymore. Thanks to all my family for all the support, I realliy appreciated it when I was alive, I love you all and please know that I went away happy that all of you always supported me through everything.

There is not amount of money, success, companionship or advice that can save me from the pain of existing, there is nowhere to run, there is not a brighter future and things will NOT get better ever, the only way things will get better is when it finally ends, thank you all

Ohh and I almost forgot, for all my relatives who read this, you might be wondering why none ever found out I was thinking about this, well there were ""hints"", but I never showed signs of ""depression"" because I was not depressed, people idealize in their head the image of someone who's going to do this as someone who's extremely sad and depressed and what some people don't realize is that some of us are just tired of everything, it's not that we're depressed or sad. My suffering doesn't come from sadness it's just the everyday struggle that I'm tired of.

I went to the bridge today,1716095240.0,"I always have visions and thoughts of falling or flying through the air. It’s the feeling of freedom. But I never want to go splat.

I’ve had passive ideation for a few months now. And today I was so exhausted of this feeling of long-lasting underlying sadness that doesn’t go away. I was so happy in the morning. And in the afternoon I went for a walk, went to the cafe, went book shopping, went to a restaurant. I enjoyed it. But on the walk home in the park the feeling came back, the feeling that always keeps coming back, the feeling that won’t leave no matter what I do, the dull melancholy and exhaustion. 

I sat down at a bench facing the river. I thought it would calm me down or bring me a sense of peace like before. I just felt like crying instead. Whenever I get a chance to breathe, to think, to be, I just feel like crying. I’m so tired, so exhausted of it.

I stood at the bridge crossing the river. I had no plans of jumping at all really. I just wanted to feel that control, the feeling of being able to stare down death, to look down at the water, to know that my choices matter. I can still make choices. I have agency.

But the bridge is not high enough. I don’t feel fear looking down. I know I won’t die if I jump. I don’t get the satisfaction from looking down the barrel. It’s not enough. I’m disappointed. And there’s too many people around. I can’t even cry or lean too hard on the railing because it would make a show. Too much attention.

I don’t know what drove me to go to the bridge. It’s not like I was planning to jump. But something about being able to stare down death brings me comfort, for the railing to be the only thing separating you from life and death. It’s a calming feeling, to feel so close to death but without crossing the line. I fear death. But I need reprieve.

I’m worried that my passive suicidal ideation is developing into something more active. I still don’t plan or have concrete plans. But the fact that I went to the bridge, considered its height, the potential outcomes of jumping, it worries me.

I’m scared for myself. But it’s exciting knowing there’s something out there that can calm me again. But I know it’s dangerous. It’s so sickening.",Mental_Good_8832,,False,1cvglw2,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cvglw2/i_went_to_the_bridge_today/

Over it ,1716089021.0,"The hard part of healing isn’t the trauma it the realization that you wasted your whole life just existing in survival mode. It’s the part where you where you no longer need to be alone to cope but you have already pushed everyone away because you thought you were saving them. Because everyone would be better off.  Even though being in social settings is hard and new being alone is harder. Trying to reconnect but people are wary of you. Building and creating a life feels intimidating and impossible but anything worth having is worth fighting for.
Right?……..
I’ve been in therapy since I was 12. Messed up childhood. I did emdr 2x fought like hell especially last 5years. Coming home to an empty house with no one to blame but myself. Hate it took me so long despite my best efforts. While trauma doesn’t rule my life anymore but. All that work and I’m still alone. All that work just to hear she gets better for a little while and than she’s not(“don’t trust her”) I guess they are right though.
I’m not just going through a hard time a want to end it. It’s been my whole F-ing life.
If I do something it’s not going to work. Just be thrown in crazy jail. Which doesn’t help and I have phobia of. I don’t have unrealistic expectations that life going to be great but I’m over it.

I'm an asshole.,1716087197.0,"First, for context; I was raised in a household where I would get either physically or mentally beaten if I did something wrong. For example, if I were to talk back to my mother she would mentally hurt me, which is why I have a low ego and constant suicidal thoughts. Now I'm an even worse person who gets mad every time someone comes into my room.

My mom believes that I am an asshole and I do too. I also get mad when anyone touches me without permission, causing me to flinch back and make them either worried or upset. I have lashed out at my own mother for touching me multiple times without permission and she tends to insult me when I do so.

I do have feelings, I'm not some emotionless person who doesn't care about anyone at all, (Not that people who hide their emotions are all like that) but I like to keep my bad emotions hidden since I used to get bullied for being the ***crybaby***. My bad emotions are saved until I'm at home and reading, that's when I let all my bad emotions out. Nobody cares about how I'm doing (if I'm feeling bad), and I enjoy that lack of attention; which is why I like keeping my emotions hidden.

I found a quote that perfectly describes how I am in public: *Chin up, Princess, or the crown slips.* I'm not sure where it comes from, or who said it, but in my mind I'm always saying to myself ***Don't show your emotions.*** I hate myself for this, but I feel I should find a way to get over it.

Anyways, enough backstory, I just accidentally hurt my dog because I was mad, but gave her some treats right after because I felt bad. I feel like an asshole because I feel like I mentally hurt everyone around me. I don't deserve anyone who's nice to me because I just put on a mask so I can keep friends. I'm the definition of a faker and I don't get why I'm still alive if I just hurt everyone around me. I take everyone for granted and if they get mad at me my mask just slips off. The only negative emotion I show in public is anger and even when I do show my anger I just get backlash anyways so I always try to apologise either the next day or in the next 2 hours. Sorry to anyone who's actually taking time out of their day to read this, I know it's long. I've been forgotten by my father, who left when I was born; He doesn't even have partial custody and he forgot that I exist, leading him to forget my birthday last year. I'm basically the opposite of a narcissist, (for anyone reading this who doesn't know what a narcissist is: it's someone who has too high of an ego) meaning I hate everything about me, from my mind to my body to my personality to my life. I have thoughts of death every day and I know most people want long happy lives, but I don't.

I kind of just feel the want to get on a private jet as the pilot and purposely crash the plane.

I do self harm, but not cutting, I'll get into that later. I already have the tools to hurt myself. I sometimes pick at my body while finding everything that people hate about me, even if they don't say it. I honestly am a brat, and my mom is so helpful at cheering me up. Lies. She is awesome at making me feel better about myself. Lies. My dad is always there for me. Lies. My life is absolutely awesome. More lies. I honestly hate everything about me, like I already said. I feel like everyone I love is so happy and has a great life, other than this one friend of mine who is going through the same thing as me. We both seemed to have started getting suicidal thoughts for the same  reasons. Our grandparents hate us (In my case grandparent) and they treat us like dog shit and as if we're not human. We also started having these thoughts at the beginning of our fourth grade year (In which we were in the same class.) The only two things keeping me alive right now is that I'm a fucking pussy who can't act on her thoughts, and that I have things to research that I wish I had. A recent example was a study of skin cancer. I enjoy starving myself, which is one of the only types of self harm I do; The other type of self harm consists of picking at my skin with any objects that will pinch, basically I would use a crab's claw if I got that desperate to feel pain. Pain brings me joy for some reason. I'm not talented, I'm only skilled. I have nothing special to keep me going and I'm a financial burden on my already struggling mother. Sometimes I just think of killing myself but then I think about why my mom would think. All of her friends either forget about her, abandon her, or die.

I can't talk to my mom about anything, because she's not reliable with emotions. What I can rely on her to do is feed my want for my life to end quickly.

I've also tried suffocating myself as if the self harm wasn't enough, (which it wasn't) and I've tried drowning myself multiple times. I'm just really tired of this sickening excuse for my life, if nothing brings me joy anymore. I'm not even that old, I'm not going to say my age but I'm not old. I honestly need to get my life together and suck all of my life's problems up; maybe from then on I can actually be happy. I have mental issues, which don't make this any better. I have frequent panic and anxiety attacks, (usually one after another) and I think keeping the mask of happiness isn't going to help me. If anyone else has been through this stomach twisting state of mind or anything remotely similar, please help me.

If this counts as anything, the two things that bring me a little bit of joy are designing my room and painting, which I don't even do often.",Former_Band2213,,False,1cveajn,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cveajn/im_an_asshole/

I feel tricked after being told it'll get better,1716083350.0,"I took pills 2 years ago, haphazard. I just got drowsy from it. Over time, I considered it more seriously. Made plans, scenarios, ruminated how to minimize the pain I'll cause. I was talked out of it by my sister. She told me things will get better. I did put effort in figuring what's worth living for. I planned cosplays, I tried to budget so I can have simple things to enjoy, I tried to be happy with what little I'm able to afford. If it's not obvious yet, I'm hella poor. I still live with my parents but not in a unemployed way, I help their small business because my mom spent her entire initial retirement money on it, and dad was hardly formally employed to receive support at his old age. Thing is I literally get 10%, rest goes to my fam. I can only afford treating myself to a hoodie once a month, I go to cheap coffee shops. Nothing big. My sister lives with us too, and ever since I asked her what she contributes (I never probe, I respect secrets, but the crashing debt was getting to me), and she said ""none"", I felt so off, I felt so worthless. She's a freelancer but she affords big industry printers that she never uses. She's always on out of town vacations, she stopped working full time so she can enroll in a culinary school to change her environment, she has full support coming from the family business I work in, which she doesn't contribute to. It feels so unfair realizing that she gets to only spend on her enjoyment. While I'm the one taking breadcrumbs after paying electricity bills, I'm the one worrying where to get money. I even suspect my mental condition is so severe because my face bloats from stress. This isn't all just finance related, my therapist diagnosed me with OCD, depression, and PTSD, and I'm still not fully accepting, and I had to stop therapy sessions after 2 years because I can't afford it anymore. But I'm ocd, I can't tell the dumbness I've gotten myself into because of my ocd. Before having this job, I used to sleep everyday for nearly two years after graduating college, I was yelled at everyday by my dad for it, he threw a chair at me, threatened me. I can't describe my life it's been all so painful. My parents are disciplinarians, I was belted, we were homeschooled as kids. I remember the environment being so severely tense as a child. But now I'm going on tangents. I just thought my sister was someone I can rely on, but now I feel neglected in every way. I'm in my late 20s and I've been trying so hard but I just feel lied to when people tell me it gets better. It's empty promises to get me going for no reason. I feel deeply manipulated after being convinced to delete notes on suicide, after tearing pages of my plans. It feels like I'm only living on for others' feelings. I'm guilty because my parents believe in hell after suicide. I don't believe in religious shit anymore, but I just can't leave them with the thought that their daughter is burning there. But lately I've been swinging between guilt and resentment. I resent how I've always felt responsible for other's feelings. I hate how easily guilt tripped I am. If I were to be selfish one day, and only consider my feelings, I would commit suicide. Because it's for me to stop this repetitive cycle of despair. I postpone and for what reason. I shouldn't be here anymore. Why am I even still here. I don't want to live another moment only to wonder what's the point. I try but I can't make life worth living for me. I'm resentful of my sister for not helping me, but I feel guilty for being resentful. it just feels so unfair and I want to stop feeling so worthless.

I have disappointed my parents and ruined my relationships with my siblings and I’m so tired of pretending I’m doing okay. I’ve fucked up anything good going for me. I don’t love the things I used to and the only thing that makes me feel happy is substances but when they wear off I have to go back to the dehabilitating emptiness I always feel. It takes all my energy to do the bare minimum to get by. I’m tired of waking up. I’m tired of breathing. I’m tired of all of this but I’m too much of a wuss to actually kill myself. I try to and then I chicken out and i just wake up the next day and pretend everything’s fine. I cry everyday and my body aches from it.

Parasitic,1716082128.0,"I'm nothing but a filthy parasite draining on my parents financially and emotionally. I've been unable to get a job for almost 4 years now. 

I have a few limitations but most people agree they are reasonable (I don't have to sleep somewhere that isn't home 3 nights a week to be able to get to work.
 I'm not standing for 8 hours in pain doing NOTHING, I'll stand 8 hours in pain if there's work to do.
I'm not lying to people to make them sign onto a 12 year financial commitment.)

I'm willing to do anything else. But Mc Donald's won't give me an interview. The rare 1 a season interview I do get ghosts me. Most applications just get ignored.
Meanwhile I'm here, using electricity my parents pay for. Eating their food. Asking them to cover my health expenses. My depression means I can't even fucking CLEAN UP for them. I'm an emotional toil. My dad feels like I stole his daughter from him (I'm trans) 
People keep suggesting welfare but that's just stealing MORE money from other people.

I'm worthless, I clearly can't even mop floors. I can't do data entry (had a temp position bit was let go after 7 workings days, only able to work 2 of them due to their system. Apparently I wasn't keeping up. A problem they never told me so I couldn't improve- as I had been, under advice of my peers, more focused on taking notes than the speed.)
I can't do anything. I've been in job employment programs but that doesn't help. Infact one of them, a film one I took, actually screwed me over unintentionally as I HAD a job, but took a break because film and media was my desired feild. And now as a result I can't get much other help. Turned away from a barista training program because I had received help. Yes where I live it's expected you take a course to be a coffee
 barista. It's 500$

I can't drive. I keep failing my tests putting my family out 200$ each time.
Everything costs money. And no matter what I do I cant make it.

So now I'm here, once again planning on just killing myself. So I can no longer waste space. Money. Resources. Oxygen. The world would be better, healthier, without a useless parasite like me hogging up food, water, and everything else. I can't even volunteer because I can't afford the buss fare to go there.
It's just... so pointless. I have no more will to do anything. My last attempt was hours into a resume and cv. My own design and people gave good feedback, but I've not got even an interview for that position I desperately wanted. So clearly I'm not good enough and can't do that either. I'm useless, stupid and I think I should just make it better for everyone if I die already.",parasite1O1,,False,1cvcphx,4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cvcphx/parasitic/

I've been suicidal for most my life, probably since around 12. My wife finally broke down and told me she wants to kill herself. She has always been the one to make me feel better and the reason i dont kill myself. The past 2 weeks we've both just been shells of people, barley talking to each other. We both just want to die. Neither of us see the point in trying any more.

My dad, who's 60 with Parkinsons, just picked up a second job to help. So hes working 7 days a week in a hospital because I'm a failure. I give pretty much all of my paycheck to him and work 3 jobs myself. Anytime I make more money, everything just gets more expensive. My wife is currently unemployed because her mental health has plummeted. I've always struggled making friends and now I have none. Only my wife. We can't afford therapy, and I've only heard horror stories of going to the ER. I don't know what other options there are.

I have a full helium tank, rubber tube attachment, and some thick trash bags to wrap around my head. I feel ready to go. I almost want my wife to do it with me.

Just know that my life isn't gonna end well at this rate. Not to sound like I'm blaming others, but it definitely doesn't help that the town I'm in is considered in the top 5 worst cities for dating in the USA. And I can definitely understand why.

All the good ones are pretty much already taken here. And yes I go out to places to try to meet people. But again, I look around and it's very very very slim pickings, if any, around my age.

Then she asked me why didn’t I tell her what was happening and why I didn’t do anything to stop it, and then she blamed it on my dad saying he had to do something to them first for them to do something to me. How can you not understand that they did it on their own account? And then she said I’m going to the up promiscuous like my older sister because she was molested also. One of my brothers apologized for raping me blaming it on hormones and how I was the “only girl in the house “ and I hope you can forgive me I know that you might not accept it but I’m sorry. And my other brother said nothing. And then my mother started blaming my dad for it again saying she failed all her children as a parent and how she failed me and that I should have came and told her what was happening.

I'm tired of living,1716079710.0,"In elementary school, I always was a very feminine boy, others kids didn't quite like it and bullied me for that to the point one day the girls locked me up in a bathroom for a whole day. I had to change school after that and I moved out.
I finished elementary school at another place where I became the person who would do the homework for everyone, still I thought this was what friendship was meant to be at the time and I didn't question it
Then came middle school. I got lots of health problems during the first year and needed to get a massive surgery (which was also a first timer given the case) done on me. My poor health led to another wave of bullying. One year later during a trip, I got raped by a classmate, someone came to get me out of the situation but when I finally got to tell the teachers they didn't believe neither of us. Following that, I got death threats during the rest of middle school from the rapist. My relationship with teachers also deteriorated from that point. The third year a case of thief got linked to me for whatever reason and I got a criminal case without even having a chance to defend myself. In the last year I discovered something was wrong with me, this was the first moment I experienced gender dysphoria but couldn't put a name on it at the time.
In highschool, I tried getting some friends, first year went relatively well except for me fighting with a lot of people. During the second year I started questioning my gender and also got into a relationship with a girl. During the following two years she invalidated every feelings I had and also repeatedly beat me up and used me for sexual favors. After highschool I left her and she then tried to convince me to kill myself, which I almost did.
Approximately at the same time, I lost all my friends because some got told by her thy I abused her, etc.. and some hide something from me : during a party we had, some people wanted to abuse me while I was asleep because I drank too much (I was out to those people), only one person stood up against it but no one told me directly what had happened. Then the year after that I tried coming out to my parents to which they replied they'd prefer me dead. I dropped out of the school I was at the moment as a result and broke down. The next year I went into uni, thinking it would be easier and because I needed to have objectives to not break. The first year I learned I got another health problem this time affecting my heart making me unable to do sports or any activity and shortening my remaining lifespan to about 10 year if left untreated.
 I am now at the end of the second year of uni, nothing has gotten better, everything went wrong in my life, I never addressed all the trauma I went through and I don't even have emotions anymore. 
I've thought about ending myself many times but never had the courage to actually do it, I always let knife slip right before piercing my throat.

My mother is 81.  She won't be around much longer.

Without my mother and wife I'll be homeless thanks to disability payments not covering living expenses.  

I'll have to give up my cats because I can't afford to take care of them.  

I live in New York City.  FFS it can't be hard to die here.  There's some sort of death trap every few feet.  But I can't break through my fear of dying to actually do anything about it.  

I'd just take a pill if I could.  But I'm afraid of pain, afraid of the nothingness of death, afraid I'll fuck it up and live a much worse life.  

The only method I think I could go through with is toxic gas, which runs the risk of poisoning others as well, since I live in an apartment.  No woods to go take a tent out into.  Hanging seems like a possibility but the only time I've managed to get the sliding knot right, I panicked and broke free.

"My cat died in January. When my dog dies, I'm going with him",1716076042.0,"I am sorry if this post is not appropiate here but I have no idea where to turn for help. Or just a listening ear.

I have been suicidal since I was 12. I have no idea why it started but I think I've been struggling with depression ever since. I had a few near attempts, the one I remember clearly is when I was standing with 10 of my father's blood pressure pills in my hands.
 I was 15 when I had the guts for the first time to tell my parents. I was told to exercise more and it was left at that.

Since then suicidal thoughts come and go in waves but never really leave. I know how and where I can do it when I need to. I'm disgusted with myself. The only reason I'm not dead yet are my pets. We have many, but I have two ""soul pets"", if you know what I mean. I love all of them but that one cat and dog are my best and only friends. 

I lost my cat in January to poisoning and I've never been worse in my whole life. I still see her from the corner of my eyes and the images of her having seizures still haunts me. When I see the vet clinic I break down. When our other dog has seizures (he has epilepsy and is checked on by a vet regularly), I break down. I see a cat that resembles her, I break down.

 After she was put to sleep I could barely get out of bed for two weeks. I didn't take care of myself and had to play stupid games on my phone all the time, otherwise I started sobbing. Now I'm either empty or just want to end it all. 

My dog is still alive, but he's old. Maybe this is his last year. Maybe he has two or three left. When he's gone, my last reason to stay alive will be gone with him. I am going to go with him if I even last that long. I'm fucked up and don't think that can be helped.

human family sucks,1716074500.0,"we are so poorly evolved. i envy the creatures of wild nature that do not trouble themselves with adapting an inessentially complicated way of life. i envy the pack animals that assign roles for their community and commit to them. i envy the lone wolves that need not be taught how to make friends, do their taxes, or get a job — they have simplicity and its instinctual instruction emerges from within. humans are helpless, codependent, breakable, foolish, destructive. we leave our children behind, and they’d die. and they do. we make the wrong move, and a youth is traumatized for life. is there no potential mutation to protect us? from the world and from ourselves?

this all links back to today. i asked my mother if she could help me with something. she said yes. i further asked when she could help me, as it was something important and required for my job. she refused to give an estimate of when, just mumbled “i don’t know” “maybe soon” “….” i mentioned again, i kind of needed to know a precise date so i can make plans. she ignored me and looked at her phone for a while. i patiently asked again, she got angry, started yelling, saying i blame her for everything. i never said such a thing. i remind her that i’m not attacking her, i just needed confirmation. she says to leave her alone, and that she doesn’t feel like it anymore. i mention how this isn’t healthy and yelling isn’t necessary, how it makes me sad that i’ve been unable to practice proper conflict resolution in my life due to never learning it at home, and that it’s best to talk out the problem that isn’t as big as it seems. she says “my head hurts, i need to lie down.” she goes down to take a nap, and i bring her our cat, and it’s like all is forgotten in smiles.

is she bipolar? crazy rollercoaster of a post i know. i never interact with anybody like i do my mother. i like to hope it’s made me able to avoid these types of situations by knowing what isn’t stable behavior. it’s like i’m walking on eggshells and the prospect of asking for any favor sets her off. but yeah, looks like i’m not unlearning the “sleep away the pain” lifestyle anytime soon. that’s all she does. if anything makes her question herself and her behavior too hard, she would rather be unconscious. what a pitiful existence to lead. i work on my self improvement daily, promised myself i would never be so miserable. when i was little, she would sleep all day unless she was at work, and avoid talking to me. she doesn’t remember any of this of course. she claims to have taught me a lot. i mostly remember a lot of confusion and neglect and silence. sometimes i wonder if she’ll develop dementia or something else when she gets old, since her childhood and failed choices bother her so much. i think of this tweet i saw the other day, that said we aren’t here to parent our parents. that we cannot change their ways or help them be better when they don’t want to be. but it is so hard to resist when you’re watching an adult have an inner 5 year old’s tantrum. if i could afford to distance myself from their implosion i would. it’s a shame that humans are even allowed to procreate when they haven’t healed themselves beforehand. if only that was the order of nature. thoughtlessly passing along flawed dangerous dna has ruined us all.

but the moral of the story is: i hate how much you have to rely on other humans. how much you are at the mercy of your parents. how you are expected to accomplish everything by yourself but are given no tools or paths to doing so. how my mother secretly doesn’t want her children to ever be capable of moving out of her home - she wants slaves to gain help from instead. how during the brief summer when i lived with other relatives, she said i abandoned her, when it’s her husband who doesn’t pay the bills. i fear i’ll never be able to support myself, and i hate how i barely even want to, because i don’t even want to be here in the first place.

The first thoughts of dying was when i was a teen. Being emotionally drained from everything made me eventually start imagining me killing myself in various ways. It made me happy to imagine my body just broken and dead. The only reason why i didn't do anything is due to the belief that i will be trapped in a hell circle of life. However, my imagination wasn't enough and therefore i moved to watching peoples deaths on cameras as well as gory images from crime scenes, which would somehow comfort my thoughts. So much so that i once spend 3+ hours watching footages of dying people, which remained in my brain for months as well as gave me nightmares and hallucinations. Now I'm almost 20, out of high school, jobless and probably the most depressed i have been ever. Being a transman on hrt as well as on anti depressants, due to my nervous system and emotions, is a nice combo to make me want to end it all. I still watch gore and live death footage to distract myself and i kind of realised that this is not something people just casually do in their time of need.

I want to end myself,1716070912.0,"TW SA

My dad is a rapist. And I feel so much anger that I want to end my life.

He raped young secretaries at work (they were 17). He abused me till I was 8. Last year I heard he was sexually harassing other young children of the age of 14. He is not a hidden pedofile. Everyone knows. No one does anything. He is an ex businessman narcassist rapist. He has status.

I reported him in 2023. The was not enough direct evidence. Notes in a diary when I was 8 weren’t enough. They did arrest him, but he denied. His words: if you don’t know my daughter, you would believe her. A true confession if you ask me. Since ‘the daughter he knows’ would be a manipulative child that lies. No one thinks that. I’m the kindest shy quiet and honest person ever. He said: she thinks she is too important. She wants attention. She fucks things over. Always was a terrible child.‘We’ as a family have a lot of trouble with her. The ‘we’ does not even exist. My parents split up 25 years ago, they don’t even talk to eachother.

I wish my dad’s actions were as dumb as his words. But no. He assaulted so many women. He abused my body. I don’t have a clean phase In my life. No remembering of myself pre trauma because I was so young.

I want to end myself because I can’t take it anymore. I drank gin while tapering snri. I had withdrawal symptoms but I drank. And now I’m here in pain. I feel so alone. I am powerless since the day I was born. 

I wish I could post his fucking picture here",Repulsive-Tear-8157,,False,1cv8xza,13,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cv8xza/i_want_to_end_myself/
How did I get here.,1716070707.0,".

I’m 33F. Married. No kids. Teacher for 14 years. 

I had a horrible childhood filled with abuse and neglect. I did what everyone told me and was the first of my family to graduate college and get a job, thinking that was the key to having a better life than the people I grew up with. I became a teacher because it it wasn’t for the teachers I had growing up, I would have never made it through. 

I struggled HARD with what I now know what endometriosis and adenomyosis and fibroids and anything else that can go wrong in that area from the age of 9 until I had a hysterectomy at 31. All of my free time in my 20s was spent curled in with a heating pad, sitting in a tub of scalding hot water to ease the pain, or recovering from one of 12 surgeries to curb the pain and secure my fertility. 

The hysterectomy happened about 6 months after getting married. The husband was supportive at the time, but everything changed after that. Things got so bad I ended up attempting suicide a few months later. At the hospital after the attempt, my husband told me how dumb I was for choosing the wrong medication to end my life. I mean, he wasn’t wrong. 

Now, it’s a few years after that. I’ve been in counseling and on meds. Things are not much better. My working environment is miserable, mostly because of horribly mean and petty adults-not kids. At the same time, being around kids who are also abused and neglected and knowing I’ll never be a mom… not ideal. My husband detests me in so many ways. It makes him visibly angry when I get sick or have to take a day off work. He hates that as a teacher I get off most holidays and refuses to do anything around the house when I’m off. Like, purposefully leaves messes for me to clean. He is not in favor of adoption due to the cost. I honestly feel like he hates me and feels trapped. I’ve offered him an out, but he won’t take it. I think he’s afraid I’ll attempt again and that he will feel responsible. 

I do not have a support system of any kind. No family at all. My only friends are still friends with me because I think they are afraid if they let go, I’ll attempt again.

I honestly feel like I should have never had the hysterectomy, gotten pregnant, and let the pregnancy kill me. Everyone would have been so much kinder to me I think and I wouldn’t be so stuck where I am now. All along the way, I thought I was making the best decisions at the time. I just wanted to know what life would be like without searing pain everyday. That’s all. I thought life would be so much better and that I could accomplish so much more. I can’t believe how wrong I was. I can’t believe I am where I am and there doesn’t feel like a way out. Literally just damaged goods, waiting to expire.

even now that things are good with him, the depression and suicidal thoughts and allat arent getting any better, theyre actually getting worse. ive been having really extreme mood swings more often and more intensely, without him i cant even get out of bed or move around, ive barely done any of my schoolwork thats all due by july, and i still very much hate myself!

i pinky promised him i wouldnt leave him, that means no killing myself. i love him so much and i take pinky promises really seriously but i dont know why i did that, i hate it and i want to end everything but i know that im the only thing keeping him here, i guess that why i promised. but frick man :(

i dont know how long i can last, i dont have any sort of future im so incredibly stupid and lazy and i always self sabotage, how am i supposed to get a job or go to college one day? im 14 and ive already tried to kill myself multiple times, hows it gonna feel to be 18 one day??? 

i just dont know what to do. i dont know if i want advice or if i just want to write this down or something but i dont think any advice will help this time. 

im on medication, citalopram, that ive been on for a few months now since my last hospitalization and ive been begging my mum not to make me take it. i know she cant MAKE me but me refusing dtressed her out and i dont want to hurt her anymore i just cant take it. the feeling of taking them just disgusts me and reminds me of my attempt, they make me scared that its gonna control me and then im reminded everytime im happy that its not just me, i have stupid medication in me. 

i just dont know what to do. i cant avoid school forever, i dont think i have any sort of future, im genuinely just hopeless. i really wish he fell in love with someone else who was more stable, not me, hes the sweetest boy in the world and he doesnt deserve to have to always deal with me.

last night i got sad because we didnt have one of the ingredients to make a shirley temple at 1 in the morning and started crying, i got all dry and sad and i almost ruined his night. why the hell am i like this.

ive been asking my parents and doctors to test me for adhd, austism and bpd but they wont. i hate it. autism because of my anxiety, bpd because im 14 even though i know that they technically can test me, and adhd for whatever reason, they just wont. i want to kill them all. i dont understand why they cant just get me some tests and let me know whats wrong with me. 

my dad too, i want to kill him. i hate him. he ruins everything. awhile ago he (52?) got mad at my brother (19) and my mom (42?) was scared so i went out and he took off his hoodie and started going towards my brother aggressively so i got inbetween them and started SCREAMING at my dad that if he touches my brother ill kill him. now, like everytime, weve just been acting like nothing ever happened. why cant he aknowledge it and kill himself or something, i hate him. he refuses to stop drinking even when its ruining all of us and then he blames me for being young and ""selfish"" and ""ruining all of their lives"" i hste him 

i got a little emotional writing this so my bad, idek if anyones reading this but if you are have a great day and remember to eat (youre perfect, i pinky promise) and remember to drink some water and dont drink or smoke too much please and remind someone that you love them and just take care of yourself! bye bye, sorry!!

Sick of this life.,1716065184.0,"Since I was 5 I wanted to end this shit life. I was raped before I was 5. Taken from my family. Used as a pawn on family court. Told my entire life I was why my parents had to divorce. Because I was placed in a group home. I spent my entire k-5 locked in a small room. Do to undiagnosed depression and anxiety! 

Back in the 80’s no one gave a fuck about mental health especially in children. Always told just deal with it. Everyone lives suck, we can compare notes if you’d like. I’ve made federal judges cry.  

My entire life has been one fuck up after another. I got used by friends,family, bosses, courts. 

Life was manageable. Meet my now x wife started a a little family. We just finished college. I was working in the automotive industry. Not making much but a start. Do that work for some shitty people. And start to get to the point I’m ready to start my own. 

Well just a few months later I got hurt on the job. Had a life changing back injury. And lost everything over night even my tools. Which got stolen while I was recovering. 40,000.00 of my life savings y gone.  

Few years later I find a note how my wife isn’t happy anymore and wants a co worker. I leave and get begged back. We were apart 9 months and we talked about trying for or family. We did for another 13 years till a new little one came.  

This was my mental health breakdown. I raised my kids. When I worked I took care of them daily. My wife worked nights and slept till just before work. Feed the kids drop them off at daycare. And I didn’t want this life again. Was finally facing the fact I couldn’t work just before him I got my Ssdi. Before work comp is a joke! 

I started pissing blood the day he was born. I tried to talk to her. And she just went to the same old just deal with it any time I had an issue. That was here response anytime I had a struggle with the children at night I’m at work deal with it. I tried for so long. Till I started saying I was done feeling this way. Just for her to put of the time on me. My pains never matched her.

I’d rub her back while my screamed in pain. While my leg trembled in pain. But that’s what you do. And I’d get everyone has pain if I brought mine up. 

Well three later little one is now three and she starts coming home and going straight to her phone. And everything from dinner to how was work was a fight. 
I caught her cheating. She came home from work with an overnight bag in her truck. Said what’s that none of my business. Like yes it is! Well I’m leaving you. My suicidal tendencies started kicking in. And I tried that night with my dad in my truck. Telling me how life mattered not more then mine mf. We have history especially childhood abuse. Like I guess we both die today. 

She told me she was done with him, for her to leave that Friday. Dropping my kids off at her mother’s.  She lied about everything. Kicked me out well tried. Then took my two youngest kids three hours away and had my 15 year old daughter lie about where they moved. They both said only a 45 minute drive not three hours. 

Now a year and half later still playing her games. She uses I have a girlfriend against me. I’m still married to her I’m low income. And been fighting you want this divorce me. Since that’s been what she wanted since the day I found out, she has left my son to go chase men in other states with his teenage sister. He’s none verbal. 

I’m so over fighting for my family. 43 years and I’m tired of never having life go good. Tired of my kids being used by women. I been here before with my oldest son’s mother. She used everything I begged her not to do against me. And I’m so ready. I wake up every day from nightmares. Haven’t slept a full night in 14 years. I’m mentally exhausted.

I don't want to live my life anymore. I've tried fighting as long as I could but I feel like I'm ready to give up. I want to kill myself but I'm too scared to try. What is wrong with me? From the outside, it looks like I've got it all. A job, a caring family, friends. I'm ungrateful. I'm stupid. I'm a horrible person. I fail at everything. I am the reason my life is where it is for better or for worse. I've never been closer to killing myself. I guess the reason I'm posting this is just to get it off my chest.

If so, then it's just another indication of how fucked up I am. 

I am just a waste of space. A pit people throw effort into only to realize it's bottomless. I don't think the way my mind works is compatible with this world.

I came to the Netherlands to work and change my life, the company put me in an accommodation with 250 people from different cultures, and on my birthday after months alone and without friends and family, I bought this Xbox S, to play something and use my free time, the internet was to slow and was taking to a long time to download my warframe, I play this game from 2016 until now.
12 hours to download, so I bought wine just relaxed, and waited, I was there outside sitting in one of the trees taking some sum and drinking alone, I never drink too much, and this guy came and started to talk, my English is shit but was ok, he asked me some wine and I give, after some minutes I started to feel like in the clouds my body was not working good, I tried to get up but no strong in the leg and arms, I was feeling like I can't move and in jail inside myself, he took me to the woods and rape me I was feeling nothing, I couldn't do anything, I have no idea how long time this take, I just wanted to this stop, and I have some blackout, was dark when I was able to move and I finally got strong to move and I came to the room, I was in shame and guilty of myself, I was confused I sleep in the floor for 2 days and after that, I go to the police, they asked proves, video or photos, (wtf??) nobody helps me, I tried to work as nothing had happened and every time I looked to people I feel like they know that and I was feeling dirty, I started to use drugs to go work and try to get better alone, nobody will help me, I get that, here I'm a nobody, so in some moment I was not able to work (1 month later ) I put sick and I never come back to work, I made everything to run from that place, I find a room In other city and I just move in that same day, here, I found some silence and loniless, until this Bulgarian old guy started to bother me with small things, I cant wash my clothes always because he complain with the owner saying is too much, I can not cook because if I forgot just 1 seed of rice fall he complain saying I leave all kitchen dirty, I can not even pass in front his door he complain about noises.

I know this is hard on him and I can't even imagine what he is going through but one thing I do have experience with is death and being left behind and I can't do it again. 
The issue is, he knows me, knows what I've been through and has come to the correct conclusion that once he's gone I'll follow and he is adamant that he doesn't want that for me and that even though it will be hard I'll be able to carry on and be happy again so for him I want to be able to promise that I will go on.

I am on ssi and ssd getting 158 on the first and 805 on the 3rd. the ssd is after both my parents passed they put me on my dads disability drawing off what he earned working but I was originally on ssi to begin with.

I get about 963 a month total to live on. Right now I am in major debt with credit cards since covid broke out. I had to use them to live on. 

I moved in with my aunt who is living in apartments based on income but they are not section 8 but they accept section 8. When i moved in, i was told by the manager i didn't need to put my income since i was a cotenant. that was 10 yrs ago. come to find out. i had to put my income now i am being sued by the housing authority for 10k, i owe two more years. my aunt and i pay 220 a month to them. they don't care what happened they just want their money. 

i owe one credit card company 4.5k, another 1.8k another 600 and another 700. when i applied for them, it was 3 plus years ago. i put that i made around 700k a year when i applied to them but i was on ssdi at the time making around 11k a year. i went on the websites 3 months ago fixed the right info.

I live in a small town where nothing is available for the next 20 plus miles and have no transport. my aunt won't take me anywhere. her son who si in his late 30's lives with us and works. my aunt is on disability. I get food stamps right now worth a 130 a month which goes to my aunt even though its for me. i pay her 450 a month rent incl internet lights and 130 in food. if i don't give her the food stamps then i have to pay her another 130 a month i can't afford since all my stuff is going to her and credit cards. i legit have nothing left each month right now with having to buy myself instant mashed potatoes, oatmeal top ramen soup, noodles and spaghetti sauce. i live on that through the month. 

when she buys food with the food stamps it feeds her son, me and her. but it is only enough to last a week, then for the next 3 weeks i am starving barely eating because i can't afford much when i do buy stuff that i can put in my bedroom to eat on.

past week now, there has been no food, her son has been taking his mom and him out to eat all week not bringing anything home for me. im so hungry. the nearest food bank is 4 miles away one way, but i have no way to get there my aunt won't take me they don't deliver and when i tried getting medicaid transport to take me they said they don't schedule rides except to and from the dr's.  

I have no other family, I have no friends. I have no vehicle. been trying to get a minivan so I could live in it. I am sometimes bed ridden due to my bad joints/back/knees/feet/right leg nerve damage. I also struggle from morbid obesity I am around 500 lbs and funny thing is, with how little i eat. i should be losing weight but its the complete opposite. 

I will be 47 yrs old when I am out of debt with the credit card companies, I tried filing bankruptcy no one will touch me being under 10k in debt with the credit card companies. i contacted legal aid, the attorney who called me back said he can't help me because its under 10k. but told me how to file but chances of me filing and getting it are slim to none esp without legal help he said.

im thinking of ending my life next month when my aunt and her son leave for a week. I just can't keep living like this. if i had a minivan I could stay in it, do door dash for extra money, I could get around trying to find an aparment based on income. I bene accepted a few times to low income places but had no way to get there and now with all the debt I wouldn't be able to afford having my own place with the credit card debt.

if i stop paying the cards, and the debt collectors come after me,  they could take me to court and if they do, they could show the judge i said i made 700k a year and i didn't make that much and was on disability at the time and making only 11k a year. i found out while looking into bankruptcy that it is fraud and i could face prison time.

i just don't know what to do anymore. i really don't know what to do anymore other than ending things next month to get out of this situation i put myself in with my aunt, debt, etc. I just can't do it anymore esp without a vehicle. esp since I am bed ridden half of the day here and there due to my bad joints and weight that i have carried around for 30 yrs destroying my joints and causing nerve damage to my right leg. I can't just get up and go on the streets and live on the streets not with how badly im in pain every day esp just walking to the corner store. just a simple walk to the corner store and back and i am bed rested for an entire day barely able to move.

Confused,1716059722.0,"Hi everyone, I'm 24f and I have ADD (no full testing has been done though). I've been having these waves of overwhelming depression. At the end of last year, around November/December time, I got really bad. Since then, I've had one week or two weeks where I felt okay. During the bad times, my skin hurts. Not to the touch but like a burning/stinging sensation all over my body. Also, I'll go through waves of daily headaches where the sensation is also a burning instead of throbs. Thoughts are fully consuming and debilitating and many times I curl up unmoving because it feels like if I do they get worse. I'll just sit there, heart racing and the it feels like I need to do it. I panic with the ideas and the intense impulse and need to do it because what if the feelings do pass? But the more the waves come and with how long they last I'm starting to lose faith on the idea. The waves start out of nowhere and things don't have to be going wrong for them to start. Back in around 2019 is when I realized how controlling the thoughts are. I developed panic disorder and was prescribed lorazepam. The first time I took one my body wanted to take the whole bottle so bad the my arm was trembling cause I physically was fighting with myself. Luckily, I was able to call someone to take the bottle away. My panic attacks would last minimum 4-5 hours and happen also at random.

In the past few weeks and during this current wave a lot has happened. My home flooded about a year ago and we lost almost everything. This was my childhood home and my only sense of stability. We couldn't afford repairs and my grandmother sold it about two weeks ago. I went down to help with packing (I'm off in college rn) I could barely handle being there but I couldn't bring myself to leave. Also, a few weeks ago my uncle passed away. I haven't processed this at all. One of the things I was trying to figure out was how to reach out to them because a lot of my family keeps dying and I didn't want to lose anybody else with regrets. Years ago when my great grandmother and great great grandmother passed away, my uncles couldn't cope and went back to drugs heavily. Holidays became broken up with intoxicated holiday wishes. It was hard speaking to them when all the heartache on my end, but it's too late now. I know that I haven't dealt with death properly. I few weeks ago my lizard passed and when I went to pick him up it felt like I'd been electrocuted, my hands hurting the most. I wasn't able to remove him myself and had two wait a couple of weeks til my boyfriend visited. During this time I didn't go to the half of my room the enclosure is on (except for a few more attempts to try and get him and I had to do an online proctored exam at my desk.) I got him cremated and when the delivered his ashes is when my mom called to say my uncle passed.

The only person I really have a strong support structure is my boyfriend. With ADD, object permanence applies to people as well. We're long distance and it feels like he's not even real. It's hard to explain and I'm sure to understand if you don't deal with it. I've been reeling with this. Past bad times  (saying he hates me and the things he said/they way he has looked at me while drunk) has been consuming.

The only other thing I have is my cat. I can't keep him where I'm staying though so he's on the other side of the country with my boyfriend. He had medical issues about a year ago and I told them to go ahead with the operation. There's slim chance I would've continued without him. I wasn't able to make payments with the credit card company (CareCredit) so now they're taking me to court.

TW: SA and Domestic Violence 

My therapists brought up my past SA instances and asked me to go into detail them. My body feels so used and dirty. There was a domestic violence issue across the street a few weeks ago. While I witnessed it and debated calling the police (I did), I realized I do have trauma with how intensely I felt the fear.  

Sorry it's a lot, I want to just keep going but it would be rambly. With the severity of the depression waves and everything that's  been going on, I've been content with with the thoughts. Things have been a lot constantly in the past but the cycles never end. It's been really hard to complete school. I started in 2018 and I finished my Associates this recent spring. I really just don't have anything. Nothing I enjoy doing now and no thought for when I'm done with my bachelor's. I keep pushing, but as of right now I think it's only to stick around for other people.

I'm so done with it all,1716059540.0,"For the last 2 years I've been good, attended mental hospital once and have been in therapy since then plus on ADHD meds bc I have diagnosed ADHD plus NPD. My whole life sucks. Bad grades, horrible gpa, divorced parents and only one of them genuinely cares and supports me. Fully independent person, I've distanced so many ppl from my personal life that way they don't and can't know. I'm done with it all, at least my friends sometimes care about me. I'm always the one to get mad first and when I do get mad I can never calm down for days afterwards. I do so many sports to distract my mind from mental health issues. I just want to end it all soon. All my teachers hate me and same goes for all my school coaches. I only have about one week left of school at the current moment and none of my friends want to do anything with me for the last day of school. They all hate me because of a recent incident where I got in a fight and messed up the other guy (he deserved to be put in his place, he was beating up a freshman girl). Now I've been framed for the incident and everyone shames and looks down on me. Finals are coming up and I can't study because I have to write apology letters and texts and emails to various people to apologize for my recent failures. The one girl I have liked for a long time I was going to ask her out on the last day of school but none of those friends want to see me anymore. I try to be nice but everyyime I try to be nice I end up being the ""too harsh"" person in the end. ""Money can buy happiness"" my ass, I have plenty of money and it just makes me sick to the stomach to use or see any of it. I'm depressed and sad because of money. I have donated so much to other people and given back to churches and charities but it never makes me feel happy in return. I haven't smiled out of pure happiness in over 3 years and am cold and either too loud or too quiet. I'm extremely narcissistic and always want control of everything I can't have control over. I just want 5 more years to try and prove that life is worth my time that I have already wasted. Just have to make it to 20, then I'll make my decision. But for now I want to end it before my time is up. To the average person my life would seem amazing and so enjoyable but deep down it sucks and I just want to disappear off the face of the planet for good. The only thing keeping me alive is the fear that my father might follow in my footsteps because he's been hit pretty hard due to work and so many other things. My mom doesn't care about my own goals or thoughts and is never trying to be supportive or on my side of things. My brother is the only person I've trusted and he just sees another happy person instead of a cold, narcissistic, depressed kid who wants to die. I constantly think about just ending it all tomorrow but I know that if I do end it all, everything will fall apart even more and nothing will get better for anyone. My late girlfriend killed herself because she didn't see good in humans and didn't want to be a part of the world. Same goes for me now.

nobody loves me or even cares about me outside of my family.

Intrusive suicidal thoughts ,1716058976.0,"Hello. When I was 16, I had a suicide attempt. It wasn't spontaneous, I planned it very carefully for several months. Then there was quite a difficult period, but I managed to look into the future and just tried to live. During these two years, I focused on my studies because I want to study at university for free, so I need to get very good exam results. From September to March, I was very motivated and focused on my goals. And then suddenly it changed. 

From March, I have lacked energy. It's hard for me to force myself to do something, and I don't see the point in my efforts and life in general. Since then, I have had a lot of suicidal thoughts, and I didn't even notice when I started making a suicide plan. I recently received my mock exam results, and they are quite good, but when I got them, I felt upset because it doesn't really matter since I'm going to commit suicide anyway. 

I feel that I am not the one who decides whether I will live or die. These thoughts are very intrusive, I cannot resist them, and it seems that the only way to stop them is just to act on them. I go to a therapist, but I'm afraid to tell her about it because I don't want to end up in the hospital (she already warned me about it). Why is this happening? And what should I do?

Feel like this is the end...,1716057813.0,"Feel like i'm done with life almost

Cant take it anymore.

I've started living alone with the help of my dad so I can live away from my stepmother who verbally abused me. Don't have a mom since she also abused and manipulated me as a child. Feeling like i'm losing contact with my dad and brother since I feel so disconnected from day to day, like i'm trying like survivaly meet them 1 or 2 days a week, but can't rely on them cause they still can't comprehend me (and sometimes my dad is speechless or can give me anything sadly). I have diagnosed from a physchiatrist that I have an emotionally inestable personality disorder. Last monday when to my therapist from the same center and ended up being so frustrating since I wasn't able to speak that I want to kill myself again, but can't go hospitalized again since Its expensive + if I don't study I won't be able to have the economic finanzes given by studing. Unable to sleep properly, already on meds but feel like they take no effect in these moments of crisis. Lost all contact with my group, feel disconnected.

Excluded due to a rape situation that I had in the past too due to the abuser accusing me of doing it to him while myself was already with suicidal tendencies, very low selfsteem and on meds that night, unable to say no due to the strongness that my meds felt and was scared since I was blank while he touched me, justifing himself cause he was drunk. Everybody believed him and I had to changed carrera cause the things they told about me almost made me literraly kill myself by getting hitover by a car and varios self cuts with even non cutting made tools (like some piece of plastic and non sharpened scissors). Batltling a lawsuit against him since 2 years but the university counsil still takes too long, and also says that my case was ""out of the limit"" due to being moments after 2 years, which the rules from that part says that they can't take cases if evidence that happened is over the 2 year limit. Still battling for it but is tiring.

Don't know if I will be financilly stable since my body is not capable of doing this anymore. It is not guarantted yet if I will be able to get more financial support for my studies since dad only compromised to pay me an student room if I maintin studing (and need to so I can earn money after I graduated, I want to but now I feel worthless). Felt like a waste of money and sure my abusive pasts will agree. Also my stepmother told me several times that I am someone fucked in the head, and at other moments that people fucked in the head should kill themselfes or be killed. I want to report her to authorities but she still living (and still married) with my dad who Idk how he feels about this anymore. There are even hospital records from my pasts psychologist that she told me that I'm fucked in the head. Feel like i'm financially abused in someway due to that if I report her, my dad would feel like to cut of my 1 of 2 only financial support that I have, since I ""escaped"" from my old house due to her abuse. I've even been hospitalized 2 times last year due to problems with her by base.

Also trying to appeal financial support for months, since I'm scared I'll end up homeless with no money to support my university carrer anymore. I don't want to come back to that old household i'm very scared of her that I tremble and I'm speechlees if I see her again. Want to avoid her at any cost.

Also ended up with no friends since my household problems ended up affecting me with my group, ending up relying on them too much that now they are gone. I almost see or talk with just 1 but the distance is there for me. Like I just want to be burried and get a funeral since I don't want to be a waste anymore. Want but can't sleep cause if I sleep I sleep like 15 hours, which scares me. Going to the medic takes like 2 weeks if I don't get hospitalized, and I don't want to and can't afford it. Last time I got hospitalized I was sacred for life when I heard the shouts of pain from one of the patients who had dementia and made me really scared, remind me of my own screams too.

Idk, I'm even poor and dont 3vent have motivation to kill myself properly. I just cut myself my upper legs and thats all I can do since i'm scared that if they discover in my residency i'm suicidal, they'll exclude me like all the people in my life that I met told them, since even i'm being told from other people that i'm being manipulative when i'ts just me who is on the border of life and death. Even dreams are more lively than real life.

I feel even worthless that the only joy that I have is seeing art of my favorite character who is also dead but is alive to me. Sometimes i would like to be with him by his side. Even tried it with character.ai at one point but lost motivation too.

I can't help myself anymore. And idk why my therapist said that i'm not like this and always telling me that I have all this things ahead, when my complete present is a boiling water that burns and eats my braing like i feel like i'll be like a vegetable by getting eated and eated mentally i can handle it anymore.

Well turns out she was interested and after a 2nd day of catching up and being together we kissed. I returned back home, and my wife's OCD his new levels of controlling me. I ended up breaking and saying I didn't love her and I wanted a divorce. I just wanted out. I wanted to be free. I felt so trapped and suffocated and I also ended up telling her about the kiss.

I moved out of the dorms a month ago to live at my grandmas until me and my gf could find a place of our own and so I could find a job. My city is scarce for opportunities and I applied everywhere around here I could and to some places a couple hours away. I heard back from none of them except one who basically told me they didn't like my portfolio. So I figured I'd settle for an entry level job like retail until I can find a job with my degree.

Heres the issue. I'm extemely picky about jobs. I won't do any fast food, I won't do register/cashier work, I won't do heavy labor and a lot of lifting, and I won't take below $14 hourly with raises to come. Throughout college I just focused on school and didnt work. So I was very frugral with my savings but I don't have much left and need a job soon because my grandma is selling her house and planning to move states this summer. I need to get out and have my own place by August likely, maybe sooner.

You were my beacon, the one who gave me a reason to smile when I thought I had none left. You held me when I felt like I was falling apart, and your strength gave me hope when I had none. But the burden has become too great for me to bear. I can't go on anymore 
I want you to know that this is not your fault. You did everything you could to save me, to heal me. Your love was the only good thing in my messed up world . I'm  eternally grateful I met you  
Please remember me not as someone who gave up, but as someone who tried so hard to stay. Remember the moments of laughter we shared, the dreams we built together, and the love that was so real and pure. Keep those memories close to your heart and with that goodbye.

I can’t go on anymore,1716048757.0,"I’m tired and the noise won’t stop. 

I (25M) have been dealing with a lot that life has handed me. It’s too hard for me to handle and I just can’t take it anymore. 

In April 2023 I received a phone call that my niece who was only a few months old had suddenly passed away. A few hours later I got a phone call that my older sister, the mother of my niece, had passed away. It crumbled me. But I tried to keep it together. Life had already been a bit tough considering our father had passed away in 2014 and a few months after that our house burned down so we had to restart. But I was trying to stay healthy and happy while I grieved and kept going in life. 

A few months later in September 2023 I received a phone call that my stepfather lost his fight with lung cancer and he passed. He was like a father to me. When I didn’t have a dad to show me how to be a man he stepped up. Took care of me and helped raise me in my teenage years. Losing him hurt. It was like losing my dad all over again. 

December of 2023 came and I was waiting for the year to be over. To start fresh. Keep on going and pick up where I left off on my goals in life. But life had other plans and I received a call that my other older sister was in the hospital and dieing. I flew across the country to be with her. I watched her die on New Year’s Eve night. Another sister gone. Another family member gone. I’ve lost so much and it was so hard but my partner and soul mate was with me to help take care of me. She tended to me and helped me when I struggled. 

2024 came and I was still going on strong in life. I was trying to save money for a wedding and to propose to my gf of 4 years. She had been with me through it all. I stayed strong most of the time. I was able to find happiness and light in such dark times. I would break down every now and again. Sometimes by myself and sometimes I would seek my significant other for help. I didn’t want to be a sad depressed person all day everyday. In April of 2024 my gf who had helped me day in and day out for 4 years said we needed to talk. She said she felt I didn’t care about her, I didn’t want to spend time with her, and that she was tired of feeling not cared for. She packed up her things and left. In a matter of seconds I finally lost it all. Disappeared. 

Essentially I just can’t take it anymore. I’m trying a therapist but it isn’t helping much and I don’t want to be put on medication. I wake up every morning, panic frantically, look around at my empty room, and get nauseous from the panic that I vomit. I can’t help it. Every morning. My mind doesn’t stop. It’s like an old train that keeps running. Metal grinding against metal. I think of everything. Every situation. Every outcome. The past. The future. The present. It doesn’t stop going. It’s a loud noise and I’m so exhausted. I’m tired emotionally, physically, and mentally. I want to break down and cry as she holds me. The noise won’t go away and I want it to stop. I want to end it. I can’t do this anymore. Everything is dieing around me. Everything I touch dies except myself and it’s not fair.

I know others will be hurt by my actions, but I really don’t care anymore. It’s not enough of a reason to live. Living for other people will only break your heart. 

I have nothing left to live for. My career is in the toilet. My “friends” are all fake or they’ve left. I have always had really bad runs with romantic relationships, I choose toxic people, and I’m toxic too. I know it’s because being chronically depressed and suicidal doesn’t make it easy on anyone. I wish I could make it stop, but I can’t. I am just so unhappy. 

I cried for hours yesterday. Literally nearly just 8 hours. I went to sleep and woke up, thinking it would might clear my head, but I still feel the exact same. I am set on my decision. 

I’m a failure, and I can’t live while that is true. There’s nothing I can do to change it either. I’ve been trying for years, but I am what I am. I can’t keep going anymore. I wrote a note and all, but I just thought I would document this something else here too. I just never want to wake up. I’m done.

I can’t live without my cat ,1716047569.0,"My cat went missing a few days ago. I can’t remember exactly how many days because a family member was briefly in the hospital, and my life has been chaotic ever since. Maybe I would have noticed he was missing sooner if things had been different.

He was the most loyal cat. In the nine years I’ve had him since adopting him as a kitten, he had never been missing for more than a day. I live in a rural area, so he always had the choice to go outdoors and indoors as he pleased. During the day, he’d usually hang around outside by the barn or wherever his people were, and he’d always come inside at night for dinner and stay inside until morning. If I didn’t see him at the door right away, he would meow or scratch on the wall until I let him in.

He was a very healthy cat for his age, and I wasn’t expecting to lose him anytime soon. I miss him so much it’s soul crushing and unbearable. And it’s all my fault. By the time I realized he was missing and started searching, calling, and putting out food for him, it had already been longer than he had ever been missing before. Without him, I feel like I’ve been living the same day over and over again for the past week. All I think about is killing myself it’s the only thing that consumes my mind.

I’m going to be 33 and I wouldn’t say there was anything major that acted like a catalyst tipping me over the edge. Everything has just slowly chipped away at myself enough to where I do not believe anything will change or more importantly I don’t believe I can change. I don’t have any interest in what the rest of my life would be. I don’t understand what is wrong with me. I never had real friends growing up like everyone else did. I don’t know how to talk to people. I went through college alone. It’s been a decade since then and I still don’t know how to talk to people or have friends. I don’t have any self esteem. I don’t enjoy anything anymore. I don’t have anything of interest to distract me from being a total loser. I always wanted to get married and have kids as far back as middle school, but I would be a fool to still continue to think that will happen. I can’t even have a friend. The only thing that kept a glimmer of hope was that I don’t think I’m unattractive and I’m in somewhat good shape. But socially I’m hideous. I don’t use Facebook or anything and the times that I considered it, I remind myself that I wouldn’t have any friends to add or pictures to show so people would think something must be wrong with me and I would be embarrassing myself. I know that even my parents think I’m a loser and say it without actually saying it. I think I would have killed myself already if they weren’t alive. Other than knowing it would probably devastate them, I can’t come up with any reason to not kill myself. I don’t matter in the sense that I don’t have a wife, children, or even a pet that relies on me. I’m easily replaceable at work. I don’t have any friends to even know if I disappeared. Honestly, no one would know for weeks. The first to know would be my apartment complex after they would eventually enter my apartment for not paying my rent. I feel so humiliated and alone and sad and weak and worthless and defective and don’t understand what was and is wrong with me. I fooled myself into thinking everything would work out growing up because I was a good, nice person that no one disliked. At the same time though I didn’t let anyone really get to know me beyond being a good, nice person. At the time, I couldn’t see how harmful that would be, but after years and years, the harm added up and destroyed my self esteem beyond repair.

abortion - no heartbeat - no confirmation scan. Depressed ,1716043672.0,"My girlfriend went to an abortion clinic with our first conceived child (that hurt)

When she was there, they measured her pregnancy and told her she was measuring 6 weeks and there was no fetal heartbeat.

My girlfriend was in pain - but instead of going to the doctors and checking on why she was having pain.. she went to an abortion clinic instead. NO.. not planned parenthood.. an abortion clinic. You can look them up. Here in the UK. Look up BPAS for example.

I never wanted her to get an abortion... she tries to justify it by the fact the embryo had no heartbeat and she was in pain but I asked her to get the pain checked out at the doctors and instead she just went to an abortion clinic.

I have researched extensively and find out that 6 weeks is when the heart starts to become detectable and sometimes its just not quite detectable at 6 weeks and that doesn't mean it was a miscarriage.

Its been 10 years.. I have no child.. I have broken up with the love of my life - why? Because to confirm miscarriage you need to have two scans.... because it shows that the baby has not grown a week later and is still lacking a heartbeat that is definite and that is the absolute standard for diagnosing miscarriage if they embryo is below 7mm in size.

I believe children should be protected in the womb.. especially my child... I cant help but resent my ex for this.. Im now 10 years older with no child and Im just so depressed.

Every time I think about her I miss her but I also think... you are the mother of my deceased child and I cant be sure your actions are the reason ill never get to meet my child.. How do I actually mve on in life.

I dont agree with abortion. Can any body tell me if im over reacting. Again.. NOT PLANNED parenthood.. didnt want her to get an abortion ... she told me she did it because the sonographer told her no heartbeat... but in a lot of cases at 6 weeks it just isnt detectable and the baby is fine.. so now I have to wonder for the rest of my life if it just wasnt too early.. I really am struggling.

Please help.. ( please no pro abortion rhetoric either... children should be protected in the womb.) .

I am curious if anyone else is planning to do somthing simular? I also assume the scary part will be the feeling of the tracks, rumbling as the train gets closer and closer with the bright lights flashing from the front of the train, at this point I’d hope the alcohol would bring me enough courage to stay in place, I am still yet to find the courage to do so.

I don't think I will ever find anything that will make the trauma I have gone through ""worth it"" enough to keep living. My therapist and I talk about this a lot. They ask me if it has to be one thing that makes everything worth it, or if it could be a lot of small things. It doesn't matter, because there is nothing. I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what could make living worth it for me.

I can't even begin to imagine what could make it worth it. There are things that I want to do before I die, random little things, but none of them matter so much to me that I absolutely have to do them before I die. I could kill myself without having done any of them and be fine with it.

My therapist talks to me about trying to be more present in the positive moments of my life so I can learn that there is more to it than just negative experiences. I don't care. Truthfully, I don't want to do that. I don't want to keep looking for reasons to live. I have looked, I have been looking, for a long time. I haven't found anything.

I was dating a girl in March till may, before her I was depressed and didn’t see the point of living, I didn’t see a future for myself, I thought no one would want me for me, cause I have boring personality. And I was hoping she would leave cause I was like it is too good to be true, to have something so good in my life, but eventually I started to trust something good was happening for me, how silly of me!

She broke up with me because she felt no spark, no excitement and felt that something was missing. Before she became my girlfriend she treated me so well, did so many thoughtful things for me. Made feel special and luckiest girl in the world. 

She was my first relationship and my first everything with a woman, just not my first date with a woman. I’m bi.

I never felt the things I have felt with her with anyone, I looked so much into our future, what our life could look like and ofcourse had worries about coming out.

It’s going to be 2 weeks on Sunday. And I have kept myself deliberately busy on weekends, I’m going for drink with a friend today. 

Anyway I have been depressed before her, and I don’t think that’s something ever going to change, I asked her multiple times if it’s really the spark thing but I wonder if she found me really boring.
She did reassure me that it is nothing I did, never been treated better etc. 

I feel fucking alone in life. Even my friends make me feel lonely and unlovable. It was birthday in March and I didn’t get any gifts from them, the only gift they gave me was a lazy, pay for my dinner when we hung out, while I gave them gifts. I was looking forward to the gifts. All my friends are pretty much surface level at the moment and friends have just drifted apart as we are all doing different things. I didn’t even get wished by my brother and I wished him for his birthday 

Even my own family,my parents are emotionally distant, nothing I do makes them happy. They praise other people’s kids.  Never once have I heard from them I am so proud of you, you did so well in your degree, you are such a good kid. Never. I do so many nice things for them like I brought a plane ticket for my dad and mum, I paid some money to get a phone for my mum. Just thank you is all I get. I never feel appreciated. 

When I talk about my struggles with life, to my mum I am made to feel like a burden. When im sad my mum says it stress her out, but never actually tries to help me out or ask me to talk about it.

I can things like I wish I was actually hit by bus. I would have been accidentally hit by a bus few weeks ago, it’s a miracle that I didn’t and I still wonder how I didn’t get hit. Cause it was SO close. I basically didn’t know the bus would be come on the road I was crossing on, it was near my work, I never been in that area before.

I even said stuff like one of these days I’ll jump in front of traffic, I don’t get any reaction from her. My father is the same emotionally distant. I feel like they had kids because of society. I am making a promise to myself to never bring my own child into this world. But sometimes I think about how much love I could give to my own kid, and really listen to them. Do the opposite of my parents. 

I went to work party and I never felt so lonely, loneliness never seems to leave me no matter where I am in life, I have felt this loneliness all my life. I never fit In anywhere. Nobody seemed interested to want to know me. And even coworkers I sit next to, they were never like stick with us for the party. To credit, my one coworker I sit next to did check up on me, she was like are you ok? Having fun etc. I would have stayed next to her but I literally had nothing to say, I didn’t want to stick around her the whole party since the whole point is to meet people, and also didn’t want to make her feel uncomfortable. It was so sweet of her to check up on me! She even said to text her when I get home. Like atleast one person cares about me tiny bit.

I have always struggled to find things to talk about, and it doesn’t help that I have memory problems. I tried adhd meds, didn’t help. I got them privately and I’m not paying a fortune for something that doesn’t work.

I do work for a weed company, I have heard stories about how much it helps patients deal with life. I still haven’t tried weed yet! But I guess my life was doomed from the start, I imagine if I supported during my childhood when I was struggling, I wouldn’t have half the problems I had. 

I’ll stick around for few years, travel for a bit and then end it all someday. I can imagine living the exact same life till I’m 80. Someday the loneliness will be so strong that it will push me over the edge.

I don’t why I am a people repellent. I wish I knew what it was about me that makes people to keep a distant and uninterested in me. All my jobs I have felt lonely and yes I know you are there to fucking work. 

But I just struggle socially. I don’t know how people find things to talk about and I really did try to talk to people. There weee few people from my home country and one would think it would be so easy to bond over but they had no interest in wanting to know me.

I was happy when I had a gf, things weren’t perfect like most relationships. but I would have wanted to be with her and work on things. But you can’t make someone to choose you. And I definitely wouldn’t want her to settle for me when she isn’t happy. She said we could remain fiends after the break up but I’m scared to message her and find out that she never meant it . I feel like most people offer to remain friends so it will soften the blow. I had secondary school friends say let’s keep in touch but never do.

I ran into my secondary school friend this week and she was like oh we should hang out, I wanted to message you etc. and me being me I texted her let’s hang out on Sunday and no response. Fml.

finally feeling good,1716025872.0,"this reddit account is basically my diary and i can write longer posts than on my twitter so, even if this isn’t exactly the right subreddit, for once im making a slightly more positive post. 

Ive never been the outgoing, cool, walk-into-a-room-and-everyone-says-hi kinda girl. Never been someone whose name is mentioned in the rooms they aren’t in. I’ve always been so anxious and kept to myself so much i could probably be clinically considered selectively mute. 

In a class at the end my senior year, a girl i had sat next to all year and had been going to school with for 7 years (and i briefly sat with at lunch in 6th grade), asked me what my name was. A girl came up to me in a class once after a presentation and told me she “didn’t know i could speak that loud”. My supervisor came up to me after 3 months of employment and said “i don’t think i’ve ever heard you say a word”. In a meeting where we had to write strengths and weaknesses of our peers, every single one of them wrote i needed to speak up more. 

People don’t realize the kind of struggle it is. It’s not that i’m quiet for fun! I’m quiet because I am thinking about everything all of the time. It’s just how my brain works. I need to collect all of the information. I need to process all of the information. I need to analyze every second of every day and if there’s nothing new then i’m thinking about every thing that has ever happened to me. And i think that’s how i ended up how i am. 

I’ve struggled with depression since i can remember. I was a happy enough kid, but some sort of darkness consumed me. I was a chronic over-thinker (and still am). I’ve been suicidal for years. It comes in waves, but there’s a constant voice somewhere in there telling me there’s no other way out of this. To me, the worst part is that there is no single traumatic event i can link any of this to. It’s all just some sort of genetic mishap or some crossed wire. That part consumes me; no one to blame, nothing that could have been done different, no other way this could have turned out. 

I turned 19 this past year. From 14 onward, i told myself i wouldn’t make it to adulthood. Then i made it to adulthood, and it turned to “i won’t make it to graduation”. Then i made it to graduation. And now it’s been another year. Every tomorrow has been a question of today. 

Something changed recently. Once again, no single event to tie it to. Maybe it was getting hit in the head by a basketball by some kid at work, or swinging at the park with my childhood best friend, a pot of kraft mac and cheese made with a little extra love.

I started talking!

I started speaking up about things that i notice, and people actually appreciated it. i learned how to make small talk. (kinda). it was really had pushing through the extremely thick walls i had built. but i think it’s paying off!

Now i can think past tomorrow. I’ve been working towards a career, figuring out what’s going to work for me and what i can work towards. I’ve been doing interviews, and the people around me are truly supporting me in ways i never imagined. 

I look at the past and pick it apart bit by bit and it feels like nothing has changed. But i stood back and took a good long look at the whole picture. And everything is different. I hope it keeps changing. ",throwaway183746289,,False,1cutsic,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cutsic/finally_feeling_good/

Finally Honest With My Therapist,1715975708.0,"Hi.

I have cerebral palsy, which carries chronic pain along with it. I also have ptsd and epilepsy.
I constantly go through depressive episodes due to this, but when it comes to actually talking about the thoughts I get, I tend to downplay and choose my words very carefully, not because I think he'd break confidentially, but because I didn't want to admit how bad it really was (over the past two years, this therapist has become one of the only people I feel I can trust fully).

Anyways, during a severe bout of pain, I had a heavy amount of death/Sui thoughts. When this happens, I tend to email my therapist, but again articulate it in a way to shift it away from outwardly admitting these ""thought of death"" are passively (and at times, actively) suicidal. However, this time, while still intentionally vague,  I made it clear that I know I need to talk about this, and worded it in a way where he may or may understand .

Spoiler: He understood. Fully. Fast forward to our session and I had a particularly rare good couple days. I started to talk about that, and he let me, but then he steered me back to my email.

We had a long, brutal talk. Inpatient commitment was talked about, but not in a way in which he felt I was in immediate danger. The way he worded it, he hates having to involuntarily commit people and would rather people be able to say, ""I don't feel safe,"" and choose to get help themselves before it reaches that point.

That conversation helped me breathe better as now I'm more open to talking about this. I've heard horror stories of therapists jumping to committing people, so I'm glad I have a good one. He is almost certain I'd be angry with him if he involuntarily committed me, but knowing him, I would have to be so close to attempting (or accidentally going to far with SH) that he'd have no choice, and by that time, I'd probably be so tired that I wouldn't fight it. 

As far as voluntary commitment — has anyone ever done that? What's it like and did it help?",thatmentallyillchic,,False,1cuema0,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cuema0/finally_honest_with_my_therapist/

My therapist told my parents that my wounds are surface wounds and that I’m not actively suicidal until I start planning to do something.

This evening, I looked up where the arteries are in your wrists. I even looked up how to avoid tendons and how to ensure that you bleed out. I’ve never looked up anything like that before. I’ve never felt so compelled to.

I just. My life is so busy and, honestly, I work really hard. But what do I get? Nothing. The adults I admire want me to be involved in everything, and they won’t accept my boundaries. What’s the point of setting boundaries if they’re crossed anyway? What’s the point of all the work I’ve done if clearly no one cares enough to even say thank you.

I’m going to get my first C ever this year. That’s because I worked and I worked and what happened? 

Nothing. 

It doesn’t matter where I go. It doesn’t matter who I talk to or who tells me I matter. I don’t. I clearly don’t. My best friends don’t want to talk to me, even though they say they do. I don’t believe them.

Miserable Life,1716020199.0,"Life has become tedious and unbearable.  I have a hard time seeing what the point is anymore.  I’m tired of going through the motions and repeating the same routine EVERY single day.  Work. Sleep. Eat. Poop. Repeat.  I simply don’t enjoy anything anymore.  My faith is shaky.  I’m tired of the spiritual battle.  My demons are winning.  The world is so fucked up.  I wish an asteroid would hit us and destroy earth.  Humanity needs a reset.  The degree of evil in the world is abhorrent.  The hate we have towards one another makes me sick.  I also know too much about how the world works and how evil the people who control things are.  We are living in a matrix where they control the way we live our lives.  Death seems to be the only escape.  My fear is that we are also destined to come back into this miserable world.  There are vampires who feed off of our fear, anxiety, and despair.  They get high off adrenochrome from the blood of tortured children.  The start and fund wars. They poison our food, our water, our air.  They distract us with their media, sports, and celebrities.  I used to have hope that there would be a revolution and we could change things but I feel hopeless that these demons will remain in power.  I feel powerless to improve my life.  I also feel that I have wasted my gifts and many opportunities I’ve had to do something with my life.  But I am an absolute failure.  I have failed to live up to my potential.  The only thing that is stopping me is my little boy.  I know it would wreck his life and he would never get over it.  Neither would my wife but I feel they would be better off without me.  I don’t want to be a burden anymore.  My life has had no significance.  I didn’t make the world a better place.  Like everyone, my life has just been about surviving.  Working and paying bills.  I also have a lot of medical bills from being in the psyche ward because I was depressed and suicidal.  I don’t want to go back.  We spent all that money for nothing.   What a waste. I was starting to feel somewhat normal and could function again.  As each day passes the reality hits me that I have nothing to look forward to.  Death is my constant thought and I just want my suffering to end.  I wake up and I ask God to kill me and put me out of my miserable existence.  If you read this, thank you.  I needed to get that off.  I don’t know how much longer I’ll be around. I have a rope and plan on hanging myself since my wife forced me to sell my gun.  That would have been so much easier.

One step closer,1716019924.0,"I got a step closer in my plans. I don't have a specific date or exact conditions for executing but I know where I want myself to be when it happens. I also have my red lines (no jumping in front of a train for example...; mainly because I don't want to put anyone through getting to recognize the body in that condition). Unfortunately some situations out of my control are pushing me closer and I would prefer to have more control over when but time may be running out... So I got a gun license. One step closer. Trying different guns now to see what I am going to buy. Weird, as I am not that much into guns, that I want to choose the most suitable one for me. I might still go shoot the the range once in a while so I might as well get something that I like and fits me. I feel like having a gun is not going to necessarily take me closer to the end but help me go on, as I will know that I have an easy way out, if shit gets to be too much.

As mentioned though things are not good in a way that it is not easy to fix. I am now not happy about everything moving faster and not having control. Anyway, I have accepted my condition a long time ago. I rationalized it, so I am able to take some, even a lot, of the emotional aspect out of it (not always, sometimes I feel really sad and sorry for myself; it does suck; I had a very good life and opportunity but lost it all, especially my love, what really matters in the end). The worst thing is to need to make such an important decision and planning and not being able to talk about it with anyone. So I put it here. I created a new user as my previous one could be traced to my real identity if you were a bit smart. This one should be pretty hard to link to me

I even tried to get some mental health support but: 1) I am not really into the ""talking"" therapy. I rationalize everything. I am a firm believer that a shitty life is not worth enduring. So the ""be positive"" talk doesn't work for me; 2) taking additional medication is counterproductive; as of now, as I also have some physical objectives and training/competition accomplishments that I want to achieve, and medication messes with my fitness (I am almost there on those ones :) ); 3) if I say too much, doctors can advice the authorities against gun ownership or even riding a motorcycle, so it is either lying, which makes the therapy non-effective, or just not going at all

So, again, writing it here as a sort of journaling exercise but hoping to ""talk it out"" a little because it is becoming hard to keep all this inside, especially now that I am starting to write drafts of the letters I want to leave and make some financial arrangements (for the little shit that I have left)",fbi-surveillance-bot,,False,1cusg7v,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cusg7v/one_step_closer/

I’m 15 and I hate myself and my past,1716014188.0,"When I was 13 (around the start of 8th grade) I  liked this girl ,(at the time 13, who I’ll call “EX”), and asked her out about 2 weeks into knowing her  (I knew her a little previously) and I guess we started dating. About a week or two later she started being more sexual. She sent me videos talking about sexual things she’d want to do to me and I didn’t know whether to be uncomfortable or aroused. I decided to do the same back to her but a lot more straightforward and I’d just suggest stuff. The point of this isn’t about her but instead about this new girl(15, who I’ll call GF) I’m 15 now (end of 9th) and I really like GF who likes me back too. We’ve been talking for 9 months and we both confessed we liked each other around February this year. We aren’t technically dating since she needs permission from her mom but I told her that when we do, she’d be my first girlfriend. I feel guilty about saying that since I guess I technically dated EX. And that has me thinking a lot of how much of a bad person I was since I also told her that (when we kissed) that was my first kiss. And I felt more guilty thinking of all the stuff I did with EX. I’ll spare you the time by saying we got sexual (no sex), hugged, kissed, and way more stuff that I told GF I’ve never done. I’ve made GF think like I’m an innocent person. My relationship with EX was kinda public (my mom didn’t know) but I still felt a little embarrassed with her in school for a reason I don’t know. I also decided that one night to start telling people that she sexual assaulted me (after we broke up) for some reason. I assume I felt like she did but I don’t remember. I also also decided it would be funny to “make a joke” that I would only go to bed if she sent me a nude, kinda like the “when pigs can fly” phrase basically meaning she’d never do that. She did do that and I felt extremely bad. I let all of that go and was fine until I met GF. I now fear that 2 years later all of that will come back to bite me and ruin my relationship with GF who I care so much about. I also feel disgusting for lying to GF about her being my first girlfriend, kiss, among other things. I feel like a shitty human being as I have for a while. Worst thing is that EX was a mutual friend to a lot of people I fear that she has proof of me doing all of that stuff and is going to expose, which would ruin me and GF’s relationship. Me not saying all of that isn’t technically hurting our relationship since most of that I felt wasn’t out of love but I’m 100% sure I’m feeding into my own delusional thoughts. I keep trying to justify it by saying reasons for all that stuff such as saying that because I dated EX in middle school that it’s not a real relationship. I genuinely hate myself and I’m trying so hard to move on even with the guilt. If I tell her it would ruin our relationship and then I’d have nobody. I completely deserve this and I want to kill myself. But I at least want to try to change before I do so.

I feel like nobody understands,1716013872.0,"I'm feeling really bad again and I feel like nobody understands my pain, especially people offline.

I'm a trans girl (aged 23) and I've had dysphoria for as long as I can remember.

From being a very young child, I've had dysphoria. I always wanted to be a girl and that pain ate up my childhood. I feel like I've been in mental pain all my life.

When I became a teenager, I hated how my body was changing, and I wanted to kill myself. I was so envious of how other girls just got to grow breasts naturally and didn't have to deal with the hell of thick body hair and voice dropping.

And periods. I know they're not easy but they're kind of a form of sisterhood so I've always felt left out from not getting one.

Also having a period means you might be able to have a baby. I have wanted to be a Mum for as long as I can remember. I have felt baby fever since puberty. I'm feeling it right now. Knowing that I can never grow a baby with a man just cuts me up. Especially since people don't understand why a trans woman might want to get pregnant.

And having to deal with this awful body and the thing in-between my legs. I want to get it removed but I'm scared that the surgery will go wrong and I won't have a functioning vagina.

I'm trying to make the best of my shitty life but I wish I had an out of some kind. A school friend took his own life recently and I wish that I had the courage to do the same. I know that it would ruin my family's life but at least the pain would be over.

Is it possible to make it truly look like an accident and does that make it less selfish?,1716011159.0,"I'm a 21-year-old female and I have a lot of mental health issues (depression, anxiety, BPD, OCD, the works). I've wanted to off myself since I was 13 but have always felt like it would be selfish to do to my parents and my sister. For context, my greatest dream in life is to be a mom, and for many reasons I've ruined that chance for myself and also wouldn't trust myself to raise children who could potentially end up just like me. So IMO, there's no reason to stay because I don't want anything else from life than having a family (which I know I can't) and I'm in constant physical and mental pain from sadness and regret from my life choices. I have zero motivation to be here anymore and nothing to look forward to. I can't remember the last time I felt actually happy and it's kind of getting old lol. However, I have a boyfriend of 3 years, a best friend of 9 years, and a family who loves me a lot. I know I would destroy them if I left to escape my own suffering -- like just because I'm f\*cked up doesn't mean they should have to end up f\*cked up too. But I also don't think it's fair that I should have to live with myself for another several decades just to protect them. I've thought about ways I could go to hurt them less (I know that would be difficult but I thought it might be believable if I got into an inherently dangerous hobby ahead of time and had an ""accident"" doing that) but it would still obviously cause them pain regardless.

I have loved this person since the moment I laid eyes on him and always felt like we were meant for each other. We dated throughout high school but I broke up with him before senior year ended. It really was never bad between us… it’s just things happened that was emotionally too hard for us at that age to handle. We kept in touch for awhile but after a year or so we stopped talking. Once I was healed I realized I had messed up but he had moved hours away. I packed my car up and decided I was going to go win him back. I went gassed up and about to get his address when I checked Facebook…. “New relationship status”. My heart shattered. I went home and bawled myself to sleep and cried for at least a month or so… right then and there I promised myself no matter what point in my life I am at if he ever is single again, I will go after him and give it my all.. all of my relationships since him have been me just going through the motions and in some ways losing myself. Not caring who I am with to the point I started being abused. I was in a really low point in my life to the point I didn’t want this life anymore. But I couldn’t do that to him. I’ve stayed here for him, I love him, I want him. While being hit, thrown down, sexually assaulted, yelled at, etc…  I would lay there crying, my thoughts would rush to him and just thinking of him is what kept me here on this earth.. kept me mentally going. One day I was creeping on his mom’s facebook and realized he was now single… in that moment I jumped with joy. I broke up with my current hell of a relationship. I kicked his ass out of my house. I waited a bit and then reached out to him… we have been in contact ever since and to my knowledge it was bliss… he even came and saw me this past weekend and stayed with me. I have loved this person for half of my life. 12 whole years. To me he is the love of my life. I don’t think I will ever love anyone like this ever again. I don’t want to. Tonight he tells me that he doesn’t feel the same way, he hasn’t felt the same way since we started talking a couple months ago… he wanted to wait until we saw each other in person to say anything.

I am 34 and been struggling for the last 10 years? probably more. I have noticed as I get older the dark thoughts go longer, more intense and the urge to just call it a day is overwhelming at times. I haven't slept properly in months and just have nightmares that don't settle.

Since the start of 2024 I made an effort to get better, a real effort. I started therapy and would consider my relationship with my therapist as good, we have a good understanding of one another but even going through the process I just don't feel like I have made progress, if anything I feel worse. I became more aware of how things **should** be rather than just functioning on my messed up thought process. I made an effort to rethink my reactions but it hasn't worked, I just feel more down and out of the game.

I workout, I eat healthy, I work for myself, I try maintain a network of friends and try do all the right things that people tell you to do but it's all meaningless, it just feels like motions you go through to try experience what ever this thing called life is. Through therapy and psychology I learned life is pain, deep emotional pain and I just can't keep it up, it really hurts everyday.

Nothing new.,1716007242.0," It's been around a year since I made my last account for this place, but nothing's changed. Sure, I'm less lonely, sure, I sort of have some ambition but none of that has any value really. I'm still just existing, not even trying. Like, I know the only way I'll probably die is by taking my own life, maybe not now, but in the near future. I'm just not cut out for this whole 'be a productive member of society' thing. I'm lazy, I'm incompetent, I can't help anyone. I love my friends so so much but I can't do anything to show that. Like, I manage to be less than useless, funny, right?

Worst part is it's all my fault. I have the potential to be better, I'm the only one stopping myself from changing. It's not like I'm genetically predisposed to eternal stagnation. But alas, why bother? I'm in highschool, I have a whole future right? But man I'm really starting to think there's gonna be nothing valuable there. Like, it won't be bad but it'll just be boring. Completely meaningless to me. what's the point really? I could make 6 figures and adopt a cat or become a musician but that wouldn't make me happy. I don't want any of that, I don't even know what I want in the first place. If my life is just being alive for the sake of it rather than actually living then why bother? I'm so tired. And I'm a bad person too, like objectively speaking. I try my best but I'm so caught up in my own issues right now that I'm basically incapable of helping anyone. I feel selfish, really.

who will water my plants when i'm gone?,1716006898.0,"i feel as though i must tell my story. i also want someone to listen to me; anonymously. i could go to my friends but i do not like being a bother. i am in the process of distancing myself so they don't notice when i'm gone. i plan to end it all by june. post-graduation. 

i've never had ambitions. even as a child i knew i was going to die by my hand. my childhood was troubled based on the things i can remember. i would purposely endanger myself because of things at home, which resulted in multiple hospital visits and led me down the road of unusual forms of self harm... along with its ""trendy"" forms (much to my dismay). in the 4th grade i didn't attend school much. i was either hospitalized or at home coping through video games and literature. after those visits my mother would always make sure to berate me for being so fucked. i only attended 33 days of that school year. to this day i do not know how i was let forward a year. 

by middle school i was sexually harassed by my peers because of my (at the time) sexuality. ""i can make you straight"" followed by groping was something i dealt with constantly. i switched schools and one of them had the gall to say sorry AFTER i switched and was let off scott-fucking-free. the school i switched to was fine, but that summer i was groomed for 5 months and i've still never recovered. i'll never forget that he would make me shower on call with him... and i'm still scared of showering to this day. i'm almost an adult and i haven't gotten over something that happened when i was TWELVE. utterly pathetic.

the rest has been a blur to me. its all been shadowed by my groomer and his memory. i always think i should've stayed longer, but i would've most likely ended up dead in a few weeks time. funny because we've started talking again. i KNOW its wrong and i KNOW it has such detrimental effects on my mental and physical health... but no one loves me like he does. he has a job and an actual adult girlfriend and goes to college and it fucks me up. he's so much more put together than me plus i'm making him cheat on his girlfriend just to feel the love that no one around me has given me in so long. i want to spend my last days as a minor with him.

I need help. I’m not kms but I wish I could. ,1716006891.0,"Never posted here, the last 2 months of my life have been hell. My girlfriend that I loved more than anything in the world dumped me at random and I had to see her everyday at college. Im 18 and she’s 25, she took financial advantage of me and never really cared about me often telling me I was a bad person and constantly invalidating me because of my age. While it’s better for me that she’s gone it still hurts so fucking much. No matter what I do I cannot get over her and the thought of her fucking other people makes me sick.

On top of that I have extreme depression and suicidal thoughts that pair with this to make it horrible. I haven’t smiled in weeks and my friends are getting sick and tired of me being a sad sack of shit all the time. They don’t understand how much pain I’m in and still hangout with my ex all the time in favor of me. I have begun becoming overwhelmed and shutting myself down in social settings to avoid spreading and infecting my friends and others with my negativity. I lost all passion and motivation in my life and nothing gives me pleasure anymore. I am only alive because I’m too afraid to kill myself and my parents would be broken and I don’t want to do that to them. I’m only alive for other people, I have given up on myself, I won’t find another girl like her and I feel like I can’t trust anybody. I constantly see visions of me hanging and shooting myself in the head and the thoughts are getting way too much to deal with. I get panic attacks when I drive because it takes all my power to not swerve into a tree (I would never hurt anyone else just myself) I began self harming by cutting legs with my car keys because I deserve to suffer. People like me are a waste of time. I fucking hate myself and I wish I would just never wake up again. I’m pathetic, I gave all my power and confidence to someone who never loved me and as a man I feel like I have failed. I lost the only person who truly understood me and now I’m left with nothing. I’m a shell of the happy confident person I once was and I no longer have the motivation to gain it back. If this is what is bringing me to the brink of suicide, then god knows how much I’ll crumble once I graduate and make into the real world. If a failed relationship after 3 months and some suicidal thoughts is all it takes to make me give up, then I do truly deserve to die. Death is the only thing that can free me, I want nothing else than for the pain to end and I feel like suicide is my only option. The world has nothing else to offer me because I won’t accept it. I wish everyone I know could forget about me so I can die and end this waste of a life.

I’m happily tired,1716006331.0,"I’ll be honest in saying that my mental health is probably the best it’s been in years. But then I remember that my darkest days really weren’t that long ago. The things that turned my life around was 1. Literally having to drive to a mandatory lecture while 100% still legally intoxicated after a failed attempt. (Please don’t drink and drive, even if you want to end it. Don’t bring others down with you) 2. Realizing I’m transgender (I’m not here for a debate)

But in those darkest of days, I made a plan. Start to finish. Every little detail is written out. And my method is still stashed away, along with the rest of my “departure luggage” as I call it. I made peace with the fact that I’ll probably be dead by the age of 30, most likely from my own hands. In some strange sense, it’s calming to know I have everything ready for when that decision is made, whenever that is.

Somedays too, even if I’m not feeling down, I just wanna do it. Get it over with. I’m tired of waiting for “the big day”. And to be honest, I’m still tired of life, the same way I was not too long ago, especially as a trans person as of late. I’m not here to hurt people or brainwash them. I just wanna be me. Yet everyone tells me I’m better off dead. Maybe I am. I planned everything anyways so maybe this has been my sign all along I’ve just been ignoring. I’m tired of being political fodder, I’m tired of be a low class working slave to billionaires, I’m tired of waiting for the day that the next war is announced, I’m tired of waiting for the next catastrophic weather event.

I feel like I have no one. Everyone who was close to me has said mean things to other people about me and I feel like no one is on my side or close to me anymore.

For context, im a senior in highschool and about to start college, I’m hoping that once I get away from some of these people, life may get better. 

I have Maladaptive Daydreaming, a severe addiction to daydreaming, where I have a beautiful fantasy world. It’s been vivid in my mind that if I were to die I could live in that world, which scares me by that part alone.

I don’t remember the last time I hung out with someone. And it’s not for lack of trying. I tried to be friends with my coworkers, but they didn’t want to hangout with me or be around me. Then I started school and I tried to be friends with my classmates and it was all fine at first and then they stopped talking to me out of nowhere. I sit alone in class, I don’t think half my classmates even know my name. Now, someone I considered a friend came back home from abroad for 6 weeks. I made plans with him and he basically ghosted me. I knew nothing until 10pm that night, when one of his other friends texted me and said he’s “not feeling it tonight”. He’s hanging out with other people, and explicitly not inviting me. And no it’s not paranoia, he actually said “no, you can’t come.” Hes been having parties every weekend since he got here and excluding me. I joined a sports team (that I suck at) and instead of making friends I’m just getting bullied and left out. Again.

I don’t have a single person I would consider my friend and I’m getting so fucking lonely. I keep asking myself what the point of being alive is anymore when literally no one wants to be around me. I’m 20 and it’s a Friday night and i want to do something other than sit at home crying, but I have literally no one I can call. So instead, I’m posting on Reddit. I can’t even tell someone I want to die because I have no one. I’m finding it really hard to see a point in continuing my life. I hate this constant feeling of anxiety I have.

Just dreading life,1716000111.0,"I don't feel happy much anymore. It feels like I've been existing for existence's sake and I seriously don't matter in the slightest. I know happiness, I felt it fairly recently but not much since, if I have it's be fleeting. I was hoping school ending, an upcoming vacation, better relationships with my friends as of recent, etc would've helped but no, almost the opposite. I don't feel like there's a point rn to my life, every action is useless, I used to confide in running (which I believe I'm pretty good at) and my times get better, I get happy when I do good, but then it's nothing. I wanna help others, make something out of myself, but there's so many people who do that better than me, like I'm no one's ""person"" anymore if that makes any sense.

  
I just want something to make me truly happy but everything recently has been so boring, so monotonous, I hate it all, people seem to pity me more than like me, allowing me to try and fail to impress whilst the talk to people they care about.

Unfortunately i failed a course and was put on academic probation, meaning if fail the reintroductory course next semester so I can retake the failed course, i am kicked out of the program. The teacher who failed me never liked me either and she will most likely be the one grading me again.

I haven't worked in over a year. I was supposed to start a job as a PSW on may 10th, but they rescinded the offer because of the failed course despite me telling them during the interview. I got the offer a week later. That job was my life line. I was going to use it to get the skills experience for school and pay off my debt. My four cards are maxed out. Im 1040$ in overdraft with a daily 5$ fee compounding. My bills are bouncing. I got audited and owe a couple thousand in taxes. 

I have one friend from middle school that is another life line of mine, but she lives 10 hours away, and her life is taking off. I will be left behind i already feel the changes. Im gay and been single pretty much my whole life with the occasional few months fling.

I take the reintroductory course in October, and I've decided to take many, many short videos to leave my mom between now and october  so she can watch them and and see me everyday if i decide to leave.. 

My mom and little sister are the only reason im still here. Ive never been stable enough to move out of my parents' house. I am in the basement currently crying my eyes out once again.

They would never recover, but I dont see myself getting out of this one. My program saved me the first time. I cried when i received the offer because i didnt even think i would get in.

My life could get significantly worse by october. Theres always something in my way preventing me from excelling and just having a normal life I desire so much.

I want a fresh start.,1715994665.0,"TW: Alcoholism and Self Harm

I’m 32 M, fresh out of a 5 year abusive relationship, which followed a 7 year abusive relationship.

My family have no respect for me, they talk over my sentences like they don’t give a shit what I have to say. My opinion isn’t worth anything to them, and this has had a lasting impact that makes me feel like my opinion isn’t worth anything to anyone.

I have a career I hate, which I begrudgingly obtained a degree in the subject area for, which took me 8 years studying part time and I “achieved” the lowest possible grade.

I was diagnosed with ADHD and Autism 2 years ago after discovering my parents were advised I may have these conditions when I was 5 years old, but didn’t pursue it because that’s “just nonsense”.

I finally know what I want to do; I want to go and study a MA in Philosophy but my existing degree is not in Philosophy, nor even the arts, so I would have to study a new Bachelor’s to get it - but I can’t afford to do that, and I can’t get another student loan (UK) because I have a degree already. So that’s great.

On top of everything, after the previously mentioned 7 year relationship, I drove myself into £30,000 of debt, which I am desperately trying to get myself out of and still will be for a while. Especially now my most recent partner has left.

The last year of my life with my girlfriend of 5 years have been a nightmare of me hiding more financial stress from her, and using alcohol to deal with the weight of it myself. I’m trying to quit drinking, but as I’m sure some of you will know, it’s easier said than done.

I’m at my wits end and there isn’t many people that can help me, or will even ask me how my day is going. The people I surround myself with just use me, and I’m losing patience. It feels like everyone seems to get what they want and what they deserve, while I’m stuck.

I hadn’t self harmed in a long time, but most recently I’ve cut more times than all other self harm I’ve ever done. Not to end things, but to feel something.

At this rate I feel beyond help, even taking my own life wouldn’t help because I can’t, because I need to make sure my parents are happy and I know I couldn’t do it because of how unhappy they would be. My dog would be sad too.

Probably not gonna but idk,1715987811.0,"A little over a week ago I got a message on insta from some account that just said hi. We started talking, they asked for my snap, sent a photo of themselves and asked me to send one too. It eventually led to them asking if I've ever sent nudes before and I told them I hadn't. So they sent one first, I sent another, and this went on for a couple of photos. Pretty much right afterwards they sent me my following list and the photos of myself that I took and threatened me for money. I unadded and blocked them immediately.

Now brings me on to the second part of the problem. I have a girlfriend. We are both 20 and have been dating for almost 2 years. It took me about 5 days but I eventually told her. Not over the fear of them sending it out but the feelings of disgust and regret I have been feeling this past week. Anyway, I told her, we talked, cried, she said she forgave me but I just don't understand how she can forgive me? If I put myself in her shoes It would take an EXTREME amount energy and trust for me to be able to forgive and love them.

Now brings me to the final part. I feel like trash and I know I should. I can't even imagine wtf my girlfriend is going through right now. She has always had self esteem problems, and most of her exes have cheated on her in the past. What is so different about me that she would want to stay and actually work things out with me? I feel horrible for what I've done and it's been bringing out my suicidal thoughts again. I know I don't want to, but at the same time idfk. Honestly the only thing stopping me is my family and the extra trauma that my girlfriend would be going through if I went through with it.

My attempt failed again,1715984135.0,"Long post ahead, I'm sorry. 

A few days ago, I posted that I should kms or I won't get another chance. A little bit to what happened, I had to leave my apartment cause I really can't afford it, being unemployed and a failure who can't find a job. I thought I should kms in the apartment but felt bad because my landlady is a really kind person and I don't want to cause her trouble. I decided that I'll just be a hobo and loiter. 

The movers came and I had prepared my things to be sent to my boyfriend including my phone. I also left my note with my things and scheduled an email should he miss my note. Said my goodbyes to my kind landlady and loiter around the city. 

It's incredibly hot so I had to let the day pass in a park. Feeling tired I decided to take nap that night and thought I'll just commit after a quick rest. Soon after, I got my first hobo treatment, getting doused by a firetruck. I thought I had to do it then but I really got anxious of the people and cars passing by. I don't want to be sent to a hospital when someone saw me bleeding, I can't afford that. I decided to walk and look for a secluded place to commit but it's really hard to find one in the city even in the dead of the night. 

I walk the entire night until the next day letting my feet take me wherever. There are people and dogs everywhere, I really don't like going out and I really thought I would find a place where I won't get people's attention. My feet are sore from all the walking and I started limping. I decided to go to the county side then. I was hesitant to do this because I ran away to the country side before with the same goal in mind and my boyfriend found me somehow. And he found me again, I didn't even notice him until he hugged me. 

I'm disappointed with myself and I really don't know how to feel. I just want to die and not be a burden. We're poor and I don't want them to waste their money on me. I don't believe I'll ever be normal again. I also believe that they'll have a better life without me. My mom is really religious and had people pray for me. I stopped believing in God and I don't know if this is some divine intervention. I feel like shit. I feel like a fraud and an asshole. I still want to die.

Suicidal development,1715983509.0,"Im getting more and more tired of living, i am not even trying anymore, some days I dont even eat. As long as I can think, my life was hell, more or less severe abuse in my childhood i mostly cant even remember anymore, severe depression during school and severe mental illness during my adolescent years.
4 years ago i dropped out of college, because i could not bear it anymore to function under such extreme suffering, but it only became worse after it, i went to a few psychiatries, but not only did it not get better, they couldnt even tell me, what even was wrong with me, year after year, things just became worse, i have always faught, always even loved life in a way, but year after year it only became worse and i grew weaker and weaker, two years ago i was in a toxic, i would even say involuntary relationship in which i was more or less raped and which resulted in me losing most of my friends, because the girl i was with drew all of my friends on her side, even contacted my family, the last year i spend mostly in bed imagining me killing myself and in the last few months i have found peace with letting go of hope, because trying anything except lying in bed just results for me in unbearable pain, i see it day after day, the things i have once cherished and that seemed to be beautiful to me, grow more and more distant, almost out of sight, all people i once loved are not part of my life anymore, my best friend most likely died of an overdose, the girl i loved left me, because she herself had difficulties with her psyche and tried killing herself two times during our relationship, i lost my apartment over a year ago, because the youth welfare office wouldnt cover me anymore due to my age, after that, i was homeless a few months. After that, I went back to my parents with whom i broke off contact before that. And now i just lie in bed everyday and it gets worse and worse by the day, I am suicidal as long as i can remember, but suicide changes its colour more and more, as I have seen my dreams die one after another during the years, even the most basic things like hygiene are slipping away from me by now, a few months ago, it started, i became more and more suicial and at first i was frightened and even admitted myself to a closed psychiatric ward, but it changed, now I see it as a realistic solution to my problems, the doctor there even told me that i rejected any responsibility for my own well being, which i didnt think back then i thought i just felt too bad and was even thrown out of the clinic, because i could barely speak a word or put together a sentence and in every therapy i just started crying uncontrollably or i was shaking. Maybe she is right, but i just dont care enough anymore, i am ashamed, yes, but even that will end. My body also hurts more and more, every movement is painful, not only extremely stressful. I realised, that as more sure i am getting of killing myself, the better i am becoming in a way, i told everything to my mother and she tells me i am weak, cowardly and pathetic for truely considering it, maybe she is right, but she hated me my whole life anyways, so i dont really care, i dont care anymore for such labels, i just dont want to suffer anymore, i have put together a plan and took measures towards it, i am just missing a date and a few letters.
I think to myself that i am just waiting for one better day during which it wouldnt be unbearable to prepare everything i need to off myself and then im gone, just like that.
Suicide seemed always so far from me, even if I always thought of it in a way, I always faught against it, now, nothingness is inviting, i am broken by life, i imagine it like the memories i have of sleeping, simple nothingness, nothing to be afraid of, no pain, no memories to bear, no broken promises or shattered hope, no hate, no more fighting, nothing, the only hope i have left.

Needing advice desperately,1715976543.0,"My fiancée attempted suicide and I’m struggling not to now

Hello, Friday morning my fiancée attempted to end her life with pills. The family won’t tell me anything, and keep screaming it is all my fault.  We had a fight the night before but resolved it and ended the night saying we love each other. She then sent me a message at 4-5 saying she won’t be a burden and she loves me. I wake up usually at 5ish and asked if this was about self harm but when I didn’t get a message I assumed she was asleep. She’s sent messages like that before but this one seemed a bit different. I should have realized and drove to her house instead of work… I’ll never forgive myself for that. 

Since then her parents won’t tell me a word, I even had to call 20ish hospitals to find where she was. When I went there and waited the father screamed at me saying it’s all my fault and to leave. The mom also called me telling me she will kill me.

 My fiancée has tried this before a few years before meeting me as well and has a history of attempts. 

The only thing I know is she’s in the ICU (the hospital just told me that much) and no matter what I do the parents won’t let me see her. I honestly don’t know what to do.  I’ve never been suicidal but I can’t bear getting random photos (from the mom) of the woman I love with tubes coming out of her without any update. I don’t know if it’s normal for a suicide patient to be in the ER and then ICU for over 36 hours. Please if you have any information let me know.

Since it all happened I’ve started drinking, I haven’t eaten and I am thinking about giving everything up.

Losing the last will,1715979506.0,"I've been struggling with these ideas ever since I was so darn young.

The child that went to mom and dad at 13, asking for therapy because she was depressed l, only to hear ""you have everything you need, why should you be depressed"". The child that wouldn't eat, the child that that overexersized.

Now 28, therapy didn't work. Was put into a group setting that got ruined by 1 girl that triggered my ptsd, tried talking to friends but having lost their sister to suicide made them unsave to talk to, just in case you trigger their grief and don't want them to suffer. Talking to your significant other didn't do much either. 

My partner wants to listen, tries to in the moment, but after forgets. 

I have a plan, I've put it everywhere. I've deleted all things that were precious to me. I try to fix everything I can before it happens. You can find it literally anywhere I've been, but nothing.

What I plan to leave my Husband. I’m 26F,1715979360.0,"
I’ve tried to run for a long time – to look for the good in things and practice gratitude. And usually I was able to find something to make me wanna stay. But lately, I cant. Im suffering. I am tired of trying to out run the pain. I am falling behind and realizing that I’ll always be trying to run from it. That no matter what I do, how healthy I eat, how much I exercise, how much I try to maintain my mental wellbeing it will never really make a difference. There’s a lot of sadness from a lot of different places. So many feelings of worthlessness and the fact that I don’t think I’ve really ever felt loved by anyone. Love is supposed to be peaceful and calming and reassuring and ive never really felt that. And maybe theres no other explanation for that other than I am unlovable. I am agitated and irritated. Haunted by things I cannot change; decisions I have made and things that I have said. And as I withered away, no one noticed. I don’t blame anyone, but it does add to my theory that no one really ever cared or loved me back. Everything seemed conditional or temporary. But this is to say that I am tired of running from the things that haunt me.  I am tired of feeling alone. I am tired of the pain that I will never escape. 
 
 
You treated me decent, but in the moments that mattered – the kind of moments that saying or doing the wrong thing can really un-do any acts of love or kindness – you hurt me. What you did or didn’t do sent a clear enough message about how you feel about me. You seemed to have an excuse or explanation for anything you said or did. I tried opening up to you and letting you know when I was suffering. And in turn, you would just make me feel bad for “choosing to focus on it” or “ruin my day by thinking about it”, which somehow sends the message that’s its my fault I feel this way. Maybe you didn’t know how to handle me or maybe you really meant it. I don’t know. I needed a break from it all. Maybe we could have just drove some place, or we could’ve gone to the ballet, or to the ocean, or whatever. Maybe you never suggested any of those things because you didn’t know I was suffering. Or maybe you did know but still chose to sit tight. I don’t know which is worse. This isn’t to say that things were sour all the time. They weren’t, and some of the happiest days of my life are with you. But the sad and bad parts of our life seem to drown those out. Like I said earlier, in the moments that really mattered, you were not there. I am so sorry for the things I said or did that hurt you. I know I am not innocent and this contributes to these feelings of emptiness and self-hatred. I don’t think you truly valued me. I think surface level you did and said that you did, but your actions and some words were so hurtful that I could never believe you really loved or valued me. I hope you are able to pick up the pieces again and continue your life. Take good care of my [Dog’s Name]. I’ll be looking for him wherever I end up.

"Hitting rockbottom again, a cycle of painful memories and hopelessness",1715975968.0,"I don't know why something like this would trigger my painful memories from 4 years back, but here it goes - today I found out that I am going to lose my job (been for 2.5 years) in 2 months. It's definitely my fault, coz the first year I was applauded for excellent performance. Then prev year I started hating the change in my role and everything slipped. 

But Today, this triggered something that happened 4years back - I lost my girlfriend to cancer in 2019 after she battled it for 7 months. I lost my job a month after her death, in exactly the same manner - due to poor performance. I was there for her trying to keep her happy and I would risk losing everything else a hundred times over if that meant to save her. But I lost her and I lost everything but I anticipated my job loss. There was so much guilt and regret that I prepared to end my life. But I didn't have the guts to follow through so instead resorted to self-harm. Went to therapy and got rid of the guilt but not the regret. And honestly I moved on after that, thanks partly to my therapist. 

I tried to have a life, get into a couple of serious relationships but those never worked out because I am pathetic. 

Today, after hearing my lay-off news, everything just hit again - starting with the detailed memory of the previous layoff followed immediately by the memories of her last 7 months. 

About to be 30Y, and I feel such a deep sense of hopelessness and a failed life. The self-hate has peaked so much today that suicidal thoughts did occur momentarily but I was able to resist it. However, there is a good chance that I will give up in the next few months. Life is just unfair.

Looking back on the last 10 years, I've realised how it has all been for nothing. Every endeavour has yielded no reward , except being an exercise in futility.

I think I’m going to go. ,1715974445.0,"I self admitted to hospital on Sunday and Wednesday. Both times resulted in fuck all help. If I go a third time I’ll be sectioned (UK - 7-28 day remand in MH custody). 

I’m going to sound like a prick but I’m successful, tall, good looking (enough ig) and charismatic. I’ve been to the gym nearly every single day for  5-6 weeks. Walking 20k steps easily and quit drugs and nicotine. Alas, every day I get transported back to my own personal hell. 

My father hurt me so fucking bad as a child, so fucking bad. Beat me like he wanted to break my face. That never leaves you. I’ve got a great job but I’m in a very expensive city so I’ve financially struggled and now with 11 days until I get paid, I have exactly zero. 10k on CC and zero left. Literally nothing. Couldn’t even get the train to work. Found out my uncle in law has what looks to be terminal cancer. I just don’t know why but it impacted me. 

6 months ago I gave my statement to police, totalled 15 pages of abuse and violence, all of my 4 older siblings declined to give written statements confirming what they saw. Police couldn’t do a thing. It really fucking hurts. They all moved on and I just can’t. 

I’ve blocked them all now and I just wrote out some letters, I’ll probably burn the ones that would make them feel bad. 

Is it weird to say that I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to live like this. I tried both self medicating and doing the healthy option. Quit drugs and never felt better physically, but that one constant pain remains.

I despise this time of year,1715974240.0,"Grad season. I’ve been out of high school for about five years now (on the 31st) and I’ve done essentially nothing with my life besides rot on my dad’s couch and internally hope for death. 

I was initially accepted to an art school before I graduated (child me foolishly fantasized about a career in animation), but I dropped out during orientation week because I knew in my gut that I was being scammed, wasn’t near talented enough, and that I was making a massive mistake and was going to be drowning in debt for no benefit later. So, I saved myself from that, but then I became a NEET.

I felt great shame and discomfort over this, and still do. I was briefly living back with my mom after dropping out, and one night she snapped at me, “you’re just a kid on my couch!”. I fled to my dad’s shortly after, and originally wasn’t planning to live here, just visit for a while to buy myself some time and maybe take a gap year or something, but I’ve been stalling and too afraid to return or do anything since, and of course Covid hit and fucked everything up more. I feel paralyzed. 

As I plan to finally move back in with my mom and try to fix my useless life, I once again pass the time of year where I feel bitterness and jealousy toward the successful people earning their degrees. Why can't that be me? Why do they have supportive and gentle parents and I don’t? Why can they navigate life, and I cannot? I feel myself being consumed by rage even though it’s not their fault, it’s mine. 

I have untreated ADHD, panic disorder and on/off depression (thankfully those are treated.. well, enough to get me out of bed), OCD, and god knows what else. I feel like an alien trying to understand how everybody else does it and just “gets” it. I’m a worthless loser who deserves to die.

My husband is severely depressed and I don't know what to do,1715969218.0,"TW: self harm, suicidal ideation



My (22X) husband (25FtM) is severely depressed, and just seems to be getting worse. We both have bad ADHD, low needs autism, anxiety, and depression, and we both go to therapy weekly along with taking meds for ADHD. He just got new meds for the depression, but he hasn't taken them yet, since ""it would be weird to start them in the middle of the week."" He also has mild OCD.

He just got a new job at Safeway and managed to get his hours down to 5 hour shifts 4 days a week, but it's still really hard for him to get out the door. He's so stressed that he'll make a mistake and get fired. He doesn't think he'll last even six months working there before they fire him. He's had to call out or leave early a couple times due to the stress and just breaking down. He actually cut himself in the bathroom during one of his shifts. It's healing okay though. I'm so worried that he'll get fired, quit, or try to kill himself.

We're just starting out, and can't afford to lose the income. I'm just starting a job but barely getting 10 hours a week. I really don't want to lose him. I've never loved anyone else, and we're so similar to each other it's scary. I love him so much, and I'm terrified that he'll leave me because of the stress. I'm trying to support him. I'm trying to comfort him and tell him I love him even if he can't love himself. It's really hurting my mental health to see him like this and not know what might push him over the edge. I can't leave him. It would probably kill both of us. Him literally. He says I'm the only good thing he has, and he's the same for me.

He's been depressed since he was a child, on antidepressants since he was like 8, and in and out of mental hospitals until he was about 14. Even as a kid he would try to hurt himself and sometimes others. He says he's never been happy and wouldn't know what it was if it hit him with a brick. I don't know how to help him, and it's so hard to see him like this. He apologizes for every little thing he sees as an inconvenience for me even if he couldn't control it or it wasn't his fault. He only sees the negative and expects everything to turn out bad.

I would truly be lost without him, and I just want him to be happy. I don't know what to do to help him, support him, or make him feel better if that's even possible.

Being a young adult is hell and I seriously don’t want to do this anymore ,1715967425.0,"I’m 21 and already feel like a fucking failure in life. I’m on track to failing my degree and I’m behind all of my friends/peers who graduated last year. 

I live in the UK where you’re expected to have it all by a certain age. Graduate with your Bachelor’s, get a postgrad degree/grad scheme placement, go for further education or get a job, get a good salary by your mid-late 20s, be in a senior role by 30, get a mortgage, find “the one”, settle down and live your life financially stable with kids and/or pets. Yeah, that’s not going to ever fucking happen for me and the fact that there’s so much pressure to do this all in your 20s is fucking terrifying. 

What’s even worse is that I’m expected to navigate life as someone with a physical disability, multiple mental illnesses, along with being neurodivergent. I can barely leave my house because I deal with agoraphobia caused by years of immense trauma. I can’t live up to the standards set by society no matter how hard I try to fake it. I’ve masked my problems for years and it’s led me to being in this state. 

I’m expected to have it all and navigate life when I already have the cards stacked against me. I even isolate myself from my friends because they’re off in the workforce or doing their Master’s degrees, while I’ve been struggling to complete my Bachelor’s due to life being such a shitshow that my degree has not been a priority. A lot of my university cohort plan to become lawyers (I study a Humanities subject, not law), with a few I know personally getting training contracts to work at top law firms where they’ll be getting 6-figure salaries by their mid-20s.

why?,1715967286.0,"
we will all die someday. does it really make a difference if its by suicide or by old age? yeah you can make some cool stuff and meet nice people in that time, but in the end we all die. its pointless, and worthless actually. financial struggles, mental illnesses, relationship issues and all of those will be gone once i die. why should I even try living knowing that one day im going to die? the things keeping me alive are actually activities to help me pass time before I eventually die. i find no point in living, why should i continue living a pointless experience that will result in me achieving a short and temmporary sense of worth just for then to turn into a big lump of nothingness? 
why should i continue living knowing that my existence is only summarized in a constant loop of ups and downs that will make me arrive to the same nothingness in the end? everything is meaningless. it has always been. why make children knowing that they will have to go through struggles? i shall ask my parents that, but at what cost? it will again, be worthless. i can talk about my problems, i can go try to be normal like my mother always said i was, i can pretend to enjoy the time she gave me affection that i didnt crave anymore after years of her barely being in my life, i can go and confess my meaningless and worthless feelings to the single person that gave me a tiny sense of worth before i tried committing first, or i should kill myself already, it will be the the end , but even after writing my feelings here, it still makes no sense. its most likely meaningless anyways. i dont know why i am even writing this.

I’m sitting here ready to go ,1715967004.0,"I just need to get up off the couch, drive 5 minutes to the gun range, rent a gun and do it.  

I’m boxed into a very tight corner of my own making and I don’t see any other way out.  I have financially ruined my family and they don’t even know yet.   They will once I’m gone and read the note I left.   I’ve taken a few pills to numb my brain and help me push through the resistance.   The only thing giving me pause are my kids.  I know how devastated they are going to be.  I guess I still have a little bit of a heart left.   I just don’t see a way out where I live.   Sure, I could just sit down my wife and in laws and my family and lay it all out as to what I did.  But that is going to only result in everyone coming to the rescue of my wife and kids and I’ll end up kicked out, divorced and it’ll be like I’m dead anyways.   Even if I do die, my in laws and family will certainly swoop in and help them, they have the means.   

Everything I did, I told myself was to help my family get ahead.  In reality when it was really good it was never enough and when it went bad it was just chasing losses.  Now there is nothing left.  Credit cards are all maxed.  Almost no money in the bank.  Several bills unpaid.  And it’s all singularly my fault.  No one else put me up to this, no one told me to do it.   I was looking for a shortcut and honestly I found one at first but didn’t know when to just quit and walk away.   It was always going to just get even better I told myself.   Then came days I would lose $100k in 3 hours.  But that’s ok I’ll make it back on the next and then some.   No.  No you won’t.

I wish there was another, better way.  But there isn’t.   They will all hate me for what I have done.  But I won’t be here to experience it.  There is no god, no after life.   Just black and then nothing.  Not even consciousness. Then I’ll be put into the ground to eventually turn into oil in a million years for some spaceman’s car.   I hope they just toss my body in a paupers grave and not so much as a marker to say I ever even existed.   I leave here proud of the woman I married and proud of the kids we made.

i don't feel safe in my relationship but i have nowhere else to go. my partner is cruel then kind, but it doesn't feel right. he literally raped me a few weeks ago. it took a while before i had the guts to confront him about it, but when i did he laughed in my face & was like ""oh you get raped by everyone you meet, sounds like *you're* the problem"".

not to mention, my biggest trauma is CSA from my dad when i was like a toddler, symptoms started before i was in daycare. i had blocked it out most of my life & my mom always made excuses for my dads creepy behavior, & later on his violence.

I Think It's Time To Go...,1715959687.0,"This past year has been nothing but L's- frankly, it's been that way for the past 17 years. 

My mother was diagnosed with cancer when I was 6 years old. To create opportunities for me that she couldn't provide, she gave up custody of mend asked her sister's family to raise me in America. I ended up getting abused constantly (in fact, I would get rewarded with a movie night if I didn't cry during beatings). My father nearly killed me twice (once unintentional and once intentional), and the intentional time was for not even a warranted reaction (at least the unintentional one, however an overreaction, you could at least see where he was coming from). 

My father took out $35K+ worth of student loans in my name, even though I never needed it throughout college. Yesterday, I got laid off from my job effective one month. If I can't even hold a job, there's no way I'm going to get into law school or be a lawyer, or frankly even if I switched careers, do anything. As my mother said, ""I'm not good at anything."" 

Because my father believes in merit, he's considering forcing me to pay back the loans that he borrowed. My mother took out $20K of private loans in my name, and it's inevitable based on her business habits that she'll enter a period of struggle, which will impact me. 

I've blown up all of my friendships, mostly not due to my fault, albeit some were. I don't think I'm capable of human interaction. 

I have no friends who care about me, and I've been living with my brother who's a genius and can't relate to me as a person with failings and challenges because he's never failed in his life. When you don't even have the support of your family - in addition to not having no friends and having no capability to have meaningful connections - I think it's time to call it. 

I've tried different things, different ways. The only thing I will not try is therapy: my brother and sister both did therapy and honestly they came out worse. It was all because of our father and how he raised us that will be the root cause of it, so there's no point. 

I actually don't understand why in America, when we're so obsessed with individual freedom and rights, the one thing we don't have a right to is a right to end our own life. We stigmatize suicide so much. We have to make the best decision with the information we have at the time, and I'm convinced now that suicide is the only viable path forward. Does anyone have any thoughts for which method is most like just falling into a deep sleep and never waking up? 

As my father would say, ""if you're not going to do something well, don't do it at all."" Frankly, I haven't been living life well, despite attempts to course correct. So it's time to give up. In the end, I fell short. Choices have consequences, and it's time to accept the consequences for my incompetence.

Suicide,1715956747.0,"
In the shadows of this weary life, 
Where echoes of joy seldom play,
I tread a path of endless strife, 
A soul that's lost, a heart of clay.

Disconnected from the world's embrace, 
I drift alone, a ghost unseen,
No love, no light, no saving grace, 
A faded echo of what has been.

Unworthy of affection's touch, 
A broken spirit, hollow, cold,
The weight of sorrow proves too much, 
In this grey existence, weary, old.

Happiness, a foreign land,
Never glimpsed, nor ever known, 
In sadness' grasp I make my stand, 
A silent cry, a muted moan.

Tired of the ceaseless fight, 
Of living in this endless night, 
I seek a place where pain takes flight, 
And hope dissolves in endless light.

This isn't abnormal but the reasons stated and talking to the ex employees directly didn't sound like it matched. It sounded very sudden and that's when my worries began.

I started a degree this year having fought so hard to get this job without it about 2 years ago. So I started feeling anxious when my lead/manager couldn't tell me which mistakes I need to fix to not be in the firing line. 

I have to look after my family and myself, but have no plan for when I get fired. I've talked to ""trusted"" people at the office about my mental health and all I got was a date regarding when they will get in touch with me about my employment.

No positive words stick for longer than a day, and even walks or sunsets are failing. I can't process failing myself like this and only realizing too late that my level dropped to mediocrity.

My friends have been trying to be supportive, but after someone close to me got fired, I lost it and haven't recovered since. None of them have been able to raise what I said directly, which makes it worse when I overthink.

Another post,1715944836.0,"I use this space to think. Most of my problems, when infused with the right amount of anxiety, become reasons to end my life. I quit my job due to stress, along with general unhappiness with the position, and have been unemployed this past week. I’m 33yo, with a grad in Cybersecurity, previously a software support tech, and now an Uber driver. I plan to move into a families vacant condo for much less money, about $1000 less, Uber, and study for a cert. This will be happening in 2mo, the move is out of state. I tell you this, because there are so many problems that all lead back to ending my life, however, none else more at this point then how long I’ll have to be alone and not try to find someone. I’m ashamed of quitting, and terribly afraid of how difficult it can be to earn money this way. Driving Uber is not easy, and seeing, from time to time, beautiful available women, haunts me. I have the same impression at the gym. I cannot imagine telling a woman I’m dated what I’m going through and up against. This shame is stacked against how I’ve failed to meet anyone for the past few years, while I was employed and feeling okay about things. I’ve started to do some radical things with myself to compensate, some in sad ways. I force myself to eat close to 2lbs of vegetables a day. I’m not fat, and in relatively good shape, but I could stand to lose 30lbs. I also have started to exercise very hard, for multiple hours. I have this delusion that being in incredible good shape would be the answer to finding a catch of a woman. That if I get the fancy job after passing a certification I need, and I’m at 8% body fat, buy bunch of designer clothes, have a swank apartment, hire a professional photography to take photos for me, use those photos on a dating app, then and ONLY then, will I have a shot at finding the woman of my dreams. This plan will take me at least one year, if I can remain disciplined. But I hunger to be with someone so badly now. It’s been like this for such a long time, about 3-4 years, with a few exceptions for flings, but no real connection or relationship. It makes me so terribly sad, worse than what I went through quitting and has seemed to make my entire existence a project for a shot at being happy later on. But for now, I just can’t have that. IM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. And it makes me sick that I know I could figure out a way to defy this truth. The shame I have is so intense and my self-esteem has been crushed. To the extent that even if I found a way to meet someone, I couldn’t handle the immediate pity that woman would feel for me, and how unattractive that is. I’m literally so disgusted that I’ve let this happen and just find that it’s too far gone of a thing to try.

"I'm tired, scared, tomorrow I'm supposed to be thirty.",1715941861.0,"Hi. Tomorrow is my 30th birthday. 

I want to die.

I hear this sentence almost every day since more than a decade now. I've been in institutions dozens of times. I've been through several treatments, and my body has been ruined by SSRIs. I don't know if I'm still suffering from depression. I stopped hurting myself physically a few years ago. I don't know if things are better now. I feel like I have less suffering, but enjoy life less and less. I'm feel like I'm becoming bitter and disappointed in everything, in me, in others,but especially in me. I'm completely dysfunctional, I'm not getting the healthcare I need, I'm unable to go to appointments, I'm unable to think and be productive about anything, even though I have lots of projects. Everything I do feels like a way to procrastinate my suicide, and I generally never finish anything. The only way I manage to clear my head of all this is by sleep deprivation, which I do a lot. After 45 hours without sleep, I just stop thinking, and especially I stop feeling anything, and then I can be a bit more functional. But I do that so often that it's affecting my health. I get very very frequent ""brain zaps"", almost daily, where it's like I get an electric shock through my brain. A few days ago, after 60 hours of sleep deprivation, I stopped seeing colors for a few minutes. Everything was in shades of grey and a bit of purple. Sometimes it's also like all sounds get muted for a few seconds. It feels like someone else is playing with my senses, or what's left of them. I don't feel anything anymore, to a point where I frequently piss (or shit) myself because I don't even feel that it is happening. After 80/90 hours, I usually end up collapsing and sleeping, and when I wake up it's so horrible.

I feel numb, old and ruined. I've had diarrhea for more than a year now, and I don't really know why. I feel like my body is completely unable to feel any kind of pleasure, especially sexual pleasure, and I feel sleepy all the time, except when I stop sleeping for days. It's a powerful drug, but the comedown is hard.

I'm starting to have eczema, and it's growing on my body. At first it was a small zone in my back, and it's getting bigger and bigger. My genitals are literally atrophying from the combination of the absolute lack of sexual sensations and HRT (I'm a trans woman). I should be having regular stimulation to prevent that, but I'm complete unable to. My teeth are in ruins, from lack of brushing, from the stress that made me grind them out for years. I hate my face, I'm completely failing my transition, I hate how I look, and I hate how completely disconnected and isolated from everyone I feel.

I'm getting more and more isolated from my friends. I don't know if they are my friends anymore. They see hi if they see me, but nobody calls. Tomorrow I'll probably spend my 30th birthday alone, if I'm still alive by then.

This is not a new situation, and nothing particularly bad has happened to me recently. But the thoughts have been intense lately. I see myself dead, every bus, every car I see makes me see my dead and cold corpse lying on the pavement, every tree, every hook, every plastic bag, every knife makes me think of how I could use it to die. I'm scared of pain, and I suppose it protects me a bit, but I also love pain, I dream of it, I would want so bad for someone to punch me, to break me, to cut me, to kick me until I die. Usually when I get assaulted it's not even that bad, they grope me, slap me, it hurts for a few days, and the moment is stressful, but it's not intense enough to make me forget about how much I want to die. I was able to reach that kind of intensity years ago, when I was hitting myself and cutting me with the shards of glass embedded in my fists, but unfortunately, or fortunately, I stopped doing that.

I also don't want to hurt anyone. There are already 5 people in my family that committed suicide, I've lost my cousins, my aunts, my uncle, and as a trans girl I hear about sisters dying regularly. My boyfriend is already a widower, his previous girlfriend died a year before we met, losing me would be devastating for him. It scares me.

I said I want to die but I'm not sure it's true. Deep inside me I think I do want to live. There are things I want to do, things I want to feel, moments I want to live. But they all seem so far inaccessible, so far away, I feel tired, and I'm becoming really scared that an impulse is going to end it all.

I don't really know that to do. I don't trust doctors. I'm more scared of my life continuing as it is right now than of accidentally dying because of a suicidal impulse. SSRIs hurt me a lot, I stopped taking them since three years, and now it's becoming clear to me that I suffer from PSSD. Or it's the depression that is continuing ? I don't even know. I just know that I don't trust them, and that I don't want to see more months/years of my life wasted in a psychiatric institution, and more of my body ruined by their medications and everchanging treatments and diagnosis.

I'm scared because all of this has been going on for a while now. I don't know how to fix, or if I know, well I'm unable to. I know my peers won't be that surprised if I end up killing myself. They'll be sad for sure, but not really surprised.

I hope this won't be my last post. I don't know what to do. I wish I could say I was terrified, but not so much.",notanix1312,,False,1cu1wf3,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cu1wf3/im_tired_scared_tomorrow_im_supposed_to_be_thirty/

I'm on a burner account and I'm probably going to delete this account later. I was banned on my other account. A ban that I will take as to be fair I did kind of deserve it.

Essentially what happened is that someone posted a plan to end their own life. I won't go into detail because of their privacy and it just isn't my place but it was a chronic health condition that caused them a lot of agony. It was untreatable from my understanding.

Hi, I don’t know if this the right place to post this. Usually I’d make a throwaway for personal stuff like this but I’m desperate. 
I left an abusive household earlier this year, February 12th. It was my parent’s place. I went to a psych ward for a month, stayed at a motel for awhile. Then stayed with my aunt til I could find a place to go. It was fine for the first few days til the arguments between her and her bf started. Often times it’d get violent between the two and I’d be locked out of the apartment until early mornings of the hour, next day they’re all lovey dovey again.

I’ve been surrounded by domestic abuse my whole life and have been, for the most part, isolated from the rest of the world; so this was normal to me. The problems started happening when they’d directly involve me in it. Trying to get me into their arguments by having me pick a side, choose who to defend, telling me to call the police only to backtrack a minute later telling me not to.
If I had a room it might’ve been ok, but I was in the living room so I’d be caught in the crossfire a lot; since I’d often wake to them arguing and throwing stuff around.

I reached my breaking point yesterday. Another argument, but this time he started going at me. Mind you I said nothing to him and continued not to. But he started hurling out insults, talked about my appearance, my mom, etc etc. I didn’t say anything before, during, or after this and just tried to keep quietly reassuring my aunt it’d be ok and just to ignore him. I wanted to lock him out, since it’s not his place, name isn’t on the lease, not paying rent.
But he took the keys, both to the car and apartment and refused to give them back unless she went back with him. He kept coming in every few minutes to yell at her then goes out to smoke, then back in again. I told her to call the police or I’d call but she kept on saying no, cause she didn’t want to deal with that.

I think at that point I realized this was just a repeat of my childhood. My father would assault and batter my mom, I’d try to defend and comfort her, I’d try to get her help/call the police or family, she’d completely refuse; she’d go back to him, act all in love again, then they’d both be against me. I left my house cause I couldn’t deal with it anymore so to have to jump from one domestic abuse situation to the next is all too much for me.
I especially decided to leave because he went through my stuff. My stuff was moved around when my aunt and I were outside, and it was left in different places. I haven’t been able to find my social security card since, so now I’d need to go through the whole process of getting a new one.

I have no money, no transportation, and no type of support system. Right out of high school I became a full time caregiver for my mother (severe MS, BPD, manic episodes, and depression. Unmedicated for all except MS) along with housekeeping, and helping raise/school my youngest brother (ADHD, also unmedicated).

During these years I wasn’t getting paid for this and I wasn’t working since no one else would be able to take care of my mother if I did; other siblings were children besides my older brother, but he has autism and schizophrenia and struggles keeping up with himself. So the responsibility fell to me.

We couldn’t get state benefits for my mom, dad made too much (200k/yr) so we didn’t qualify. He’s too much of a cheapskate to put some money to the side hire a nurse, or caregiver, let alone pay me. I know he has the money to afford these things but mainly chooses to spend it on lotto tickets, gambling/betting, trips to Vegas, alcohol, expensive shoes, random products advertised to him online, steaks, lobster, etc.
All while complaining that he has no money and we’re draining him. I dont ask for money from him.

He didn’t pay for my rides to the doctors, appointments, or medicine. I had to rely on my older brother or mom to sneak me some money for that. I didn’t have money for basic needs. I wore the same clothes I had in high school; half of which were borrowed from my older brother. Only had one pair of shoes which my aunt bought me, and had to borrow soap and other hygiene products from my brothers and mom since he wouldn’t buy me any. “Oh I forgot” “I don’t have any money on me, ask your brothers” and other excuses like that.

My therapist just keeps telling me to contact dhs, go to a shelter, or stay with a friend or coworker, family even.
DHS never picks up their phone and I have no transportation to get there. There are no available shelters in my area. The ones that are open require either a referral or that I be a domestic abuse victim.
I don’t have any friends (isolated since we moved in 2013) and I’m not close with any coworkers. I’ve only been working a couple months, and for the most part I’m left to work alone, besides customer interaction.

I’ve tried telling her this isn’t a possibility but she just says someone will say yes, “you’re so nice, so someone is bound to” or “if someone else was in your situation you’d help them, so why wouldn’t they?” I’m just at the end of my ropes here. I’m really just posting this just to rant ig. I don’t really have any options left. I’ve struggled with suicidal tendencies since I was 12 and I’ve come to accept life isn’t getting better. I don’t know. I just need some advice or support. Anything I’m so desperate.

I’ve decided that this week is probably going to be my last. My brothers are old enough to not need me around anymore and the rest of my family doesn’t give a damn about me; partially due to burnt bridges during my mom’s manic episodes when she’d harass them. They want nothing to do with us now.
I’m just completely over it now.

Feeling suicidal and rubbish,1715941786.0,"I have recently handed in my notice at work. I'm moving to a competitor. I have struggled with depression for over 15 years, and I always put myself in debt £30,000 - I feel spending money is a solution to cheer me up, which makes the debt worse.. in that debt I tried to set up a business, making custom gifts and such. But it hasn't kicked off and of course this has made it worse.

Anyway, at work started putting stuff onto an account, and recently paid it back. Now I know I did wrong by not telling my boss, but was not intentional of not paying for the items. Just struggled at the time and I had to borrow money to pay that back from my family. But when they approached me, about it. They said it is stealing and they will most likely prosecute. I understand 100% where there coming from, I abused their trust and abuse of power. So I deserve what I get. I said do what they need to do. 

I am one who puts others 1st, I gave money to people who were in trouble, but at least they are okay. Never asked for anything back. But I always seem to want to fix everyone's problems off 1st and I suffer. I think I'm making excuses for my crappy reasoning.

I feel I deserve everything I get. For being an untruthful, deceitful person. Never intended to do what I did. But I have, so no excuse. 

I don't want to leave my family behind, but I think it would be easier to kill myself so they don't have to suffer from my actions. 

I have started to self harm; which when I was at work, I had a pair of scissors in my pocket and quickly tried to use them before going back in. (Dumping rubbish)

I'm a failure looking for a reason to stick it out,1715938196.0,"# So sorry to waste your time...

This is gonna be a lot, and you, of course, are not force to read this. I was just looking for something, if anything, regarding an answer to a question I am going to have to face because of my own actions. I understand that if you do choose to read all of this and reply to me, you may wish to berate and insult me. By all means, do so, I deserve it. I don't mean to write a sob story so people will sympathize will me, I don't need people's attention, I'm not coping.

For a bit of context, I am and always have been a burden on myself and those around me. I've been nothing but lazy and useless my entire life. I was the kid that never did his homework, ever. I thought it was stupid and that was my justification to not do it. I was that kind of garbage. I hated when things imposed on my happiness and freedoms, and I resented things that did that to me, like homework. I have always been told that I am full of talent and that I'm so smart or whatever, but it has never translated in my studies. I have always gotten low marks in my courses, always because of homework. If there was a way to flunk out of high school, I would've flunked out a long, long time ago. I'm so pathetic, all I've ever cared about are the things that I enjoy and not the things that are important. 

So like the idiot I am, I chose to go to college knowing the kind of person that I am, telling myself I would change because college is serious and what not. Spoiler alert, I didn't. I'm a piece of garbage and all I've ever done is waste the time and resources of those around me. I'm so fortunate that my parents paid for my college, but they said they would kick me out if I failed and all. I believed in my talents, but not in my work ethic. Sure enough, coming out of my first semester in college, I failed two out of the 5 courses I took and that put me on academic probation. Why did I fail? Well, I failed because of my crappy work ethic. I could've passed these courses with high marks if I had done my homework given that my test scores were always high or solid. As you would expect, my parents wanted to kill me, I was mocked and laughed at by my siblings, and I really didn't have a support system, not that I deserved one. 

Miraculously, I was given a second chance to fix my predicament, and I honestly felt I was doing better. I was struggling to get my work in on time, but I was still making the effort to do it (Nothing to be proud of considering it wasn't on time). This semester, although spent in the comfort of caring friends who wanted nothing but the best for me, was extremely depressing and part of me wants to blame my shortcomings on that. Mentally, this semester was really rough for me and even though nobody knew it, I was going through a really, really hard time. The other part of me knows that blaming my mental health on my shortcomings is nothing but a cop out and I would just be making excuses for myself like I always do. Anyways, looking at my grades coming out of this semester, once again, I have failed two courses, one of which was inevitable, and the other, I am currently fighting for despite grades being posted. I want to really cling to the hope of the mark being changed even though my situation really won't change much, but if it is impossible, then I will give up right there.

  
As you can see given what I have provided above, it should be clear how much of an idiot I am. I have been nothing but a failure, a disgrace, a sloth, and a piece of trash. I have wasted the money of my parents, the energy of everyone who believed in me, and my own time. I should've known I would never amount to anything. If I want to keep living, I'll be homeless and left with only the few thousand I have saved from working my summer job as a lifeguard. I have been nothing but pathetic my entire life, and honestly writing this all out makes me tear up a bit. It kind of hurts that I want to cut my life short not because I hate my life, but because it feels that there is no other options left for me to progress forward. I have given myself nothing to use to go forward because I have been nothing but my own worst enemy. I am lazy and a waste of air. I truly wish to apologize to everyone whoever believed in me, I wish I could man up and just tell it to their faces, but I am too ashamed to even turn off my computer screen and see my reflection. The grades will come in soon, and my family will know, and that will be the end of me. Right now, I plan to run away from home soon and either try and find somewhere to go or just jump off a bridge, I guess (I haven't really thought it out, it's not something I really want to think about).

  
Some of you, who may be nice enough to reach out, may say that my best bet would be to negotiate with my family, or perhaps seek a job in trades, or maybe even consider community college. I can only refute those as my parents are not the negotiable type, even if some of you insist they will be. As for trades, it is something looked down upon by my family, by my friends, and it's rubbed off on me too and I have come to loathe the idea of it. Perhaps it will be my only option, but something I've never wanted for myself was to work day in and day out breaking my back in physical labor like that. As for community college, I would not be opposed to it despite friends and family looking down on it too, but even if that was the route I decided to go down, how would I do that? Once my parents see these pathetic grades, I will be kicked out and maybe even disowned right after I get beaten half to death. Some of you should now be realizing the piece of garbage that I am for saying that, and you have every right to take back any sympathy you may have had for me. I do not deserve any help, any support, and sympathy, or advice. Honestly, I'd rather the option of suicide be validated so I can just get on with it. I think it is finally time to put my pathetic life behind me and release the burden of knowing me off of so many people. All I have ever done is hold myself back and hold others back too. All I've ever done is wish I could be better but then never would I act on it. I wish a work ethic came naturally to me like everything else, because that's the one thing that has kept me from ever succeeding. But because I'm pathetic, I could barely bring myself to succeed at having a good work ethic for more than a week. I hate myself, I truly do. 

Despite how I feel about myself and my life, I do want to clarify that I don't hate my life. I am so grateful and thankful that I have met the people that I have and I am thankful I had parents who were willing to support me. Everyone around me is better than I am and I'm so happy I got to be around such amazing figures, I just wish I could've been like that and committed to that. I'm pathetic, I have no more excuses. But I do have the question that I propose to any who have read this far: Do I stick it out, or do I just end my life already? 

For all who read all of this, I appreciate you more than you will ever come to realize, even if you read it to laugh at me or so that you could have the knowledge of my story to berate me. You guys are everything, and I can only hope the best for you all. Please never end up like me, you're all surely so talented with bright futures ahead of you, I'd hate to see you be like me.

"Poor, no resume due to abuse.",1715934146.0,"Got abused in childhood now I have nothing.

No money til the end of the month with barely any food.

No resume because I'm legally not allowed to work after I had to quit school too early.

People told me I'm smart and capable yet where were they when I was a child.

Legit sitting in my apartment trying to get music to distract me from suicidal ideation.

Only one person cares about me and I'll see them again in like a month.

Got nothing to do until then but stick to abusive people because I have no job or autonomy.

And just. No hotlines. I don't wanna go back to the ward. They don't help me there either.

I'll just stay a hermit, get old and die alone.

And this is about ideation, not a crisis.

So. Yeah.

Guess. Thank you for anyone who ever hit me.

Insulted me. Yelled at me. Deemed me crazy.

Thank you to my mother who lied in court to get me to lose.

Thank you to the therapist who told me to kill myself.

The other therapist who yelled and insulting me making me almost cry.

Thank you to the police officer who called me a whore and refused to help me and then ""had no idea what I was talking about"" when I confronted him about it next to his colleague.

Thank you to all the peer abuse I faced because I dumped someone at prom.  (Make of that what you will, I will provide context if anyone wonders.) Which apparently doesn't even matter anymore. Did it ever matter or was that just a convenient excuse to get to me due to my gender identity?

Thank you for calling me slurs.

Thank you for all the teachers who never did anything despite knowing what was going on.

Until it got worse and worse.

Yes. I hurt people in that span of time. I did. Guess I means I deserve years of abuse. I deserve getting called stupid and crazy for holding a bad presentation, or having a bad grade, or being late too class. Guess I deserve to get told to kill myself at my absolute worst state of mind because it was only ever my choice and not the product of molestation, grooming and abuse.

Rant I guess about shame and guilt of it all,1715930502.0,"I hate myself soooo much and there’s also so much I want to say about it and I just don’t know how. I’m at a point now where I feel relief when I think about dying. I’m not as scared of what’s “on the other side” as I used to be. What scares me now is that my death/funeral would burden and embarrass the people I care about. I am too embarrassed to commit Suuuuuu like I can’t even not care. 

The thought of my family having to tell anyone who asks that “oh, she…killed herself” makes me cringe so bad. And I try to think like I’ll be dead, I won’t care but I’m embarrassed on their behalf. I don’t want that for them. I don’t want them to deal with the fact that someone they loved committed. I don’t want them to have unanswered questions or feel any guilt and even if I wrote an amazing note and explained everything, I’m not kidding myself, I know that’s not enough.

But I do want to die, like so badly, I’m so miserable, I just don’t want to go that way because of the shame it’d bring. I just feel like I need to be put down, put out of my misery but I need it to be an act of God or a freak accident or an unfortunate illness that I succumb to! I need a solution. 

I wish I could just stop caring and just do it 
OR
that something else does it for me 
OR
that I can figure out a way to ask for help without also being deeply ashamed and feeling like a burden or feeling like I’m being dramatic and feeling hopeless that talking about it won’t really change anything and I’ll always feel this way until I just end it all. 

It just sucks all around cause I don’t want to bring this shit up to my family and I also physically cannot tell a stranger/therapist and I don’t have the time to build a relationship with a therapist because I’m too tired of it all and I just want life to be over with already

need to die but i’m trying so hard.,1715930102.0,"(if you’re religious you won’t want to read this) I hate life. It is pointless. There are many beautiful enjoyable things in life, but the sacrifice is so much. And yes I know we make our own purpose in life, but I just can’t seem to find a reason to have any purpose because of how short and pointless everything is. Lots of people, the majority it seems, are motivated by the goal of doing enough to be remembered. Yet, humans are such a tiny part of the universe. No matter how hard we all try to avoid and ignore the fact that we have only been here a short amount of time, we will at some point no matter how hard we try all die out and nothing we did will be remembered (maybe not but that is so far from likely is is nearly inconceivable) But why is that such an important motivation to so many? We are so insignificant it’s hilarious, yet because of many religious beliefs people think they truly are amazing and special and have some magic person watching over their every move. I wish I could believe that. I believe there could be many things we don’t understand, but that’s the point is we don’t know anything. Jesus was most likely just some schizophrenic having religious delusions(not saying he was, it just coincides very well with what we know about him). And I’m happy for the people that are able to have that as a huge relief on their back and not have to think about not knowing anything. It just sucks how so many people find relief in things that I cannot.

Idk why I’m here ,1715929676.0,For years I used to bitch and complain to social media that I wanted to die when in reality I just wanted all of the pain in my life to go away. Now years later I guess I’ve mostly adjusted to the pain. I don’t want to go to in depth but now I think I’ve reached the point of being better off yk dead. Mostly numb to the pain of life and it makes me feel even more useless. Who adjusts to having no one ? To not being a father. Who even sits here and allows their kids lives to continue on without them and I think the best thing that I could do is stay away at this point.

Called Suicide Hotline Like an Idiot,1715928925.0,"I went searching online for reviews/experiences of people calling, I wasn’t able to find much. I called, and boy do I regret it. I wouldn’t have began to spill my heart out if I had known better. Undergoing so much psychological warfare, I can’t even begin.

Two years ago I drove me and my sister from Atlanta to North Carolina to see my Father, his new wife and her children. My sister’s twin brother was supposed to come with us. He didn’t show up, wasn’t answering the phone, so we left after waiting a few hours for him. He called once we were on the road to say he had fell asleep (the Mother of his children told us he actually saw us calling and decided to ignore it). Once we arrived in NC, he called my Dad to tell him he was on his way with his kids. My brother ends up getting a flat tire in nowhere man’s land SC. My Father was cooking Thanksgiving dinner, his wife had been drinking, and I knew that meant I had to go help him. He was two hours away (mind you, I just finished a five hour journey). My sister came with me, which was helpful as I needed her to stay in the car with the children while I taught my brother how to change his tire. I was so upset do discover he had customized rims and after working for about 30mins I was not going to get that spare on. We were there for five hours. Had to leave the car, pack everyone in mine, and drive two hours back to my Father’s. When we got back, everyone had eaten and the tree was being put up. It completely broke my heart. I guess I’n an old soul because I would’ve made everyone wait until we got back. My mind as an elder would have been “They’re not eating, we’re not eating. We will all eat together today, no matter what, we’re a family.” 

The next day my Father drove my brother and his children to the car, whilst I drove my sister and I back to Atlanta. She picks a fight with me just as we enter SC and jumps out of my car while driving. She calls our Mother, our Mother calls our Father, who then calls me to say “Baby, I know I haven’t been the best Father but how I just heard your Mother speaking about you, I’m not comfortable with you going back into her home.” I then am told a friend is going to drive five hours to come and get my sister. I stay nearby a gas station until she is picked up, I wasn’t leaving my sister in a town she didn’t know in South Carolina. My Mother informs me I am not allowed back home. My Father believed the way I showed up for the family triggered my Mother and Sister.

Fast forward two years later. My Mother, Sister, and I are living together again in aims of internationally healing. My Sister drops my Mom off at the airport and calls me to vent as my Mom was so upset, she slammed the car door and refused to hug, kiss, and pray with my Sister (we always pray before flights). My sister gets T-Boned coming out of the Airport with me on the phone, I began praying immediately - shouting the protecting Blood of Jesus over her. I jump in my car and drive to the airport.

Fast forward the next day, my Mom made breakfast (she got off the plane before takeoff the night before) and my Mother puts alcohol in my drink (I have been sober for nearly two years). I am furious, as I believe she is mentally spiraling and tried to get me to relapse. My anger alone scared the living daylights out of my Mother and she tells my sister to call the police. They come, but my Mother had put on a nice pair of clothes, she did her hair, and walked out the door. I speak to them, tell them exactly what I believe is the root dysfunctional cause. They tell me this is indeed a Modern day poisoning but I am forced to leave and live in my car. Thanksgiving comes and I get a flat tire. Twenty minutes away and they couldn’t return the favor.

I am stuck in this part of the story. I had a really great job that I couldn’t keep up with because of the stress. My coworkers started treating me differently and it’s my fault. I let my boss and a selective few in on what was happening for two reasons: 1). To build community 2). Accountability. I hit pedal to the metal hard; gym, ionic foot detoxes, talk therapy. They were astonished to see how I responded to such calamity, but I have been in this ring with my family before and I wasn’t losing this round. What I didn’t expect was for those selective few co-workers to kick me down. I lost the round and the job after that. I couldn’t handle the triggers of being picked on and bullied, which they were aware I do not affiliate with people or environments as such. HR does an investigation and I come to work environment worse than the playground. Between battling them and my family, I broke down.

I’m living the life my enemies built for me. The Devil is real, he knows my name, and he’s aware of how many souls I have the capacity to save.

Please pray for me that this psychological warfare I am under does not win. We are not alone. We must fight back. Please let me hold  your hand through the darkest hour, as I invite you to hold mine.

I love you very much.

My last night.,1715924359.0,"I just want someone to hear me. Hear my crys before it all goes black. My mom's boyfriend recently beat the shit out of me.

As long as it's not them.  This last time he almost killed me, atleast I think. It's all blurry. I was being choked. It was horrible I hated it, I was so scared and confused. So many negative emotions, the worst feeling, like someone crushing you with hot metal. But I was slightly happy.  Happy that it'd be over soon. But it wasn't. He released me before i passed out from lack of oxygen. Those breaths were like heaven. These last few days I've been thinking, life would be so much better. Without life. Without living, dying. Id never have to go home again. I've decided I'm going to overdose on anything I can find in the boys bathroom after school. Ill drink bleach if it comes down to it, though Windex might be tastier. Then when someone finds my body I'll be held. For the last time. That's one part I wish I could be alive for. Somone hugging me, holding me. I haven't.

Goodbye,1715923940.0,"Hello. My name is Evelyn. Tomorrow at 2 p.m., I'm going to commit suicide by train. As much as I hate to do it that way, it's my only option. I'm only 16, so I can't buy a gun or anything.

I've always wanted to die. I'm happy that soon I'll finally be able to be free. I no longer wish to suffer, and I don't want the people around me to suffer because of me. I've always been a burden my whole life. My parents hated me, and I've never felt like I've had real friends. I know I'm never going to get better. I'm never going to be loved or cared about. I never saw myself having a good future.

It's a long story, but so much has happened in the past week. All of it's my fault.

I wish I could just be in my mom's arms. I know that makes me sound like a baby. I just wish she loved me, though.

UPDATE: This is an update for anyone who's worried or stumbles on this in the future.
Things got better and worse. I'm being sent to a really shitty place, and they aren't allowing me to do school properly. So basically, I'm going to fail everything.

I'm an asshole,1715922923.0,"This academic year has been the most challenging yet, and I’ve come to realize that I’ve morphed into a version of myself that doesn’t feel authentic. The countless sleepless nights and bouts of depression have taken a toll on me, leading me to become someone I’m not proud of. I think my upbringing, surrounded by negativity, led me to believe that being “cool” meant being toxic.

That’s exactly what I became this year–a person I’m not proud of. I kept telling myself that I would change, that I would surround myself with better people, but it was all in vain. Each new day, I would revert back to my old self, forgetting the promises I made to myself. It seemed pointless–those who were unkind and “cool” were still adored by everyone else. But I began to realize that I wasn’t the same person, and my attempts at being mean and “cool” were not well-received.

Tonight, as summer break begins and I finally get a chance to rest, I want to strive to become a better version of myself. But the question that keeps nagging at me is, how do I make this change and stick to the promises I make to myself without falling back into old, toxic habits?

Considering MAID,1715919241.0,"Well guess here's a good a place as any. I'm seriously considering MAID and have already filled out the form. I need a witness to co-sign for me but well, my parents certainly won't and I have no friends in town, and the ones I do have are very far away and wouldn't agree with my decision. I tried for a decade, the whole bit: medication, life style changes, an ESA, a solid psychologist, things did get better I'll admit but it's not enough. I'm still in the pit. And I just hit the decade milestone of this mental and physical hell. Just because I'm further from the bottom then I used to be doesn't really make a huge difference if I still can't fathom being out of it. I had three meltdowns this year already and have already self-harmed pretty badly. I'm very good at hitting the right places so that nobody can see any of the cuts, contusions or bruises. I refuse to be institutionalized, I'm only a danger to myself as I would never want to hurt anyone beyond the pain my death would logically cause some ppl and being drugged up in a facility would only solidify the prison my body already is. Once I'm dead though it's not like I'll have the capacity to feel guilt or know what others are going through, so knowing some people would be sad about my death is not a huge deterrent.I'm on the spectrum, late diagnosis but it certainly explains the severe bullying over my life and not understanding much of why so many people are complacent or apathetic of the world to the degree that change is rather improbable at any reasonable pace. I hate this place, there is good in the world but the time and effort it's going to take collectively to fix the myriad of issues on this planet, I just don't think it's going to happen in my lifetime.   
  
Personally my life is average, I'm working poor and I know that I could be happy with a small place to live and my dog, but my dog will die in a few years (he's old) and having a decent place to live is not something attainable realistically with my disability and class. I can't wait on a miracle and my parents can't help as they are poor too, I live with them. My dad's a textbook narcissist and my mum is an equally mentally ill enabler who takes her frustration with her regrets on life out on me. She said if she knew I would be born with my conditions, she wouldn't have had children. My body always has problems, and it will only continue to degrade with age as I've been informed by my GP and psych. I have several chronic issues that flare with stress so I'm in near constant pain and can't eat much. I'm sick but not sick enough for doctors to actually help me when there's ppl with cancer or other more debilitating diseases to manage. They don't care about my quality of life as long as I'm sucking air, which is par for the course with my experiences with the medical community. 

Why say all this? Well just wanted to give some background to understand my hopelessness, I'm not charming enough to get enough ppl together for collective change to actually improve my and the ppl around me's lives, my support system has been reduced to my psych (my dog and mum have decided they don't want my company anymore but well who can blame them, I'm so miserable!) and said psych has said the only solution to my mental health is to be kind to myself the last three sessions I’ve had with him. How can I be kind to this animal, this body I hate so much that I've been forced to take care of for so long. I can't maintain a level of health long enough to have a regular job or tolerate most conditions of 9-5's without severe mental and physical consequences due to the strain on my disabled ass. I'm skilled at art so I've been scraping by with freelancing on my own hours, tried so much to get regular contract or studio work but I've been rejected from over 367 jobs, starts to really feel like you're useless and unemployable after you get into the hundreds. Now freelancing has become impossible for me, I just,,I can't do it anymore. The one thing I still liked doing has lost its lustre and the pay is not worth the pain anymore. That combined with the crumbling of my support system and the work it's gonna take to rebuild anything, I'm just too tired. 

So, anyone wanna co-sign a disabled chronically depressed flesh bag cursed with consciousness and give them a peaceful gov-assisted death? Perhaps advice? My parents are away this upcoming week and I'm extremely tempted to go freeze to death in the mountains. I'm close and it would be a peaceful death comparatively.

My friends going to kill themselves,1715917891.0,"My friend 19 M is planning to kill themselves on their holiday next week. They came forward and told me 18F this today because they didn't want me to just have them disappearing suddenly. They had been planning it for a couple of months. 

They have bpd and bipolar and they have been struggling all their life with it and other trauma from their childhood. They are on meds and in therapy but they just feel like it isn't working or helping them and they are just done with it all.

I don't know if I should let someone know that they are planning to or just let them. Because I know how unhappy they are and it feels selfish to try and make them stay when they don't want to.
