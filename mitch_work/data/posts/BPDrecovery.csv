Keep picking and I'll bleed,1716117821.0,"If someone else has a right not to be yelled at or talked to disrespectfully or not listened to, then so do I. 

Why am I not allowed the same in return? Just bc I'm this person with one of the most evil,  manipulative illnesses doesn't mean I'm less than human. Other people are just as bad but don't have an official diagnosis attached. 

It's been beaten into my head since 2013 to remove myself from situations where I'll want to SI/SA until i, them or we both can speak without making it worse. I've started and it's made nothing better. 

If them going at me, not listening keeps going,  yes I'll be reactionary, but wait,  ""there's the bpd crazy girl."" Forget everything that got me there. Keep picking and I'll bleed.

I'm destined to be alone.

How do you accept that your ex is never coming back,1715950067.0,"We had a really bad breakup because of my BPD. He wanted to be friends because he genuinely cared for me but I was so angry and in so much pain that he broke up with me. I ruined the chance of being friends.

Its been 5 months now and Ive been better. I started DBT program two months ago and actually learned the tools like wise mind, pros/cons, self-soothing, TIPP and etc. I was disappointed that I didn’t know any of these tools while in the relationship. 

I tried reaching out to him hoping we can be friends but he’s so cold and rude to me. He told me that he has a new gf now and she treats him 100x better than I ever did

I decided not to message him anymore but i miss him so fucking much and im in constant loop of replaying every argument we had where it couldve been easily solved with the dbt skills.

Rumination & Nostalgia,1715940173.0,"I get caught up too often in rumination over the past. What I’ve lost, how I hurt others, how I was hurt, how I failed to cherish true love and a great partner, how life and work seemed ‘better’ in the past. 

This can lead to thoughts that I will never again have the love/life/happiness like  I remember; and a hopeless attitude towards the future (which is repeatedly leading to very destructive thinking). 

I know the best mindset is presence- not dwelling on past or hoping/dreading future. I practice my DBT skills but as you may know those require significant effort that’s way harder in times of distress or depression  

I try to counteract the nostalgia rumination with listing the ‘cons’ of the past- but that’s also exhausting and recently had triggered spirals towards life was/is/will be shit. I meditate daily but I’m finding I’m increasingly less patient with myself in that. 

I’d love thoughts and strategies on how you have (or would) manage similar. 

I’d like to feel better and be more present. ",IraJohnson,,False,1cu1hsa,20,1,https://i.redd.it/4lq8n2d4ny0d1.jpeg
I'm 7 years into recovery and crashing again,1715939922.0,"I'm starting to wonder what the point of recovery is  because being lucid and participating in the world (vaguely in order to make some money from my house) is as hard in a different way to being totally out of it mentally.

My best friends have abandoned me during the hardest time of my life ,1715877306.0,"I thought I’d share over here, perhaps at least one person will be able to relate? It’s been an incredibly hard few months for me. I am newly diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. And have had major depression disorder and anxiety since a very young age. I just got out of rehab for a weed addiction a few weeks ago (very successfully - I am not on any substances anymore and don’t plan on it again). Since being out, I’ve found it incredibly hard to adjust back into my home environment. Everything was so safe and I was so protected in the clinic. They even decreased my meds because I was doing so well. 

Fast forward to coming out and back into my home environment and I’ve never been in a worse place in my life. On top of this, two weeks ago, I found out my friend took his life. When I found this out, I tried to call my one friend, but she ignored my phone call because she was too busy smoking, knowing that I needed the support because I was alone, and one of my conditions were for my friends to please not smoke in front of me. So she didn’t pick up and chose to smoke with my other friend instead of them asking if I maybe wanted to come over for some company to grieve with them. Then, I had asked my very best friend if she would be around for company and support after my friend’s memorial. She said no, it’s too much for her. I will admit that I started lashing out on both of them after those two occasions, which I’m not proud of, but because my friend had just died and no one wanted to be around. At some point I pulled back. 

They haven’t spoken to me for two weeks, and don’t plan to. My best friend said “she just wants her old friend back”. Which makes me feel hurt because I’m still here. I am her friend. The same friend I’ve been for years. I’m just not the perfect version of myself that she wants me to be right now. I can’t have people in my life conditionally based on my circumstances. I would do anything for my friends. Especially if they were at their lowest points. I am in such a bad state that my mom is on watch for me in case she has to take me to the hospital to be under observation if I am a danger to myself. And my friends? No where to be seen. Not only have I lost my friend who took his life, but now I’ve lost two of my best friends after the fact as well. And I am alone in my grief. I just feel completely helpless. I’ve had to delete social media because they’re posting petty things to their stories. I’m finding it hard to accept that these friendships may have run their course. Because they’ve been in my life for years. But I just think it’s such a nasty thing to do, especially considering my best friend is a psychology major, who was so supportive of my diagnosis and one of the only people I opened up to about it. And is in her mid 30s, so it’s not like I can even chalk it up to an age thing. Which is such shocking and juvenile behaviour for someone in her position.

I wish there was a manual for dating with BPD - how do I know?,1715576544.0,"I have been dating someone for three months and it’s by far the healthiest, calmest, and peaceful relationship of my life. I’ll save the gushy long winded reasons and just get to it. I have never dated someone whose actions far exceed their words. They don’t promise. They don’t over compensate with flowery language. They just are. And the way they are fills me with feelings of safety and lovingness and support and kindness. It’s truly beautiful. I feel seen and understood and cared for. 

So what does my BPD do with this? CRAVE so badly to hear the reassurance with words. I want grand oral expressions of reassurance and compliments and doting. I’m a romantic and I’m loud and passionate. He’s stoic but hilarious. Very even keeled and has a very peaceful energy to him. This man lowers my energy in a way that is soothing and peaceful.

"Question about "" abuse history "" & bpd.. trigger warning. ",1715041145.0,"Hello, just letting people know who click on this post that it's related to potential SA as a child. 


Does anybody else have a really unstable childhood history, where you were physically not with either bio parents early on, but not in foster care? 

I'm now 30, F, and I was diagnosed in my early 20s with BPD, although I likely had it much earlier, as I was displaying symptoms at 12. I would say I am recovered, and I've also gained an ADHD diagnosis. I suspect ASD as well. 

Anyways, there's hope for us BPDers, as my life is pretty ' normal ' and above all, safe and stable now. I had addiction issues prior to the ADHD diagnosis, but I've found the correct med combo and with treated ADHD I feel ALOT better. Just wanted to say that.

Of course, now that I have firmly moved on from having skill breakdown moments and crisis, I do a lot of inner reflecting. My childhood as stated was extremely unstable, and I did not live with either of my bio parents, instead I was taken care of by a family friend for a large amount of my younger years along with my sibling. I was not in foster care.

 Prior to this arrangement, a family member worked in the local Social worker department and was walking down the hallway to their office one day when they saw me, a toddler, in a case workers arms. After questioning my family member was told my name was "" Baby X "" and that I had been abandoned at a baby sitters for a few months. 

I have no memory of this, of course. And this is just one of the many whack stories that occured before mine and my siblings placement with the family friend. Now that I'm able to reflect, I have been working on inner child work and ofc, have started thinking about the implications of being abandoned at a stranger's place. 

I have severe intimacy issues, and some of that is related to trauma that occured in my early teenage relationships, but at this point I'm sort of doubtful that was the only factor in my inability to be intimate. I don't like being touched, and I'm engaged in an eight year long relationship. So, like, me and my fiance make it work. We have a healthy relationship and I've come so far, and I do try to tolerate hugs and light kisses because he doesn't have the same background that I do,  at all. 

It's normal for people who love eachother to be affectionate and I do really try, but we've had sex once in six years. And now it's both of us feeling anxiety about it. In the beginning of our relationship we had a okay ish sex life, but I was really mentally ill and likely forcing myself and masking my discomfort as well as drinking/abusing substances to tolerate being touched.

 I will say my spouse has never been abusive, this was very much deep internal denial that I wasn't aware of in early adulthood. He respects me SO MUCH in fact that he doesn't try to initiate anymore because he knows contact plays danger music for me, especially if it's unexpected. ( I flinch, duck away, squirm ). 

I of course am getting tired of myself, and the fear, and this fuels my suspicions that there may have been some kind of trauma before I had memories, and  nobody can really say what happened to me. Part of my recovery is estrangement from several family members, off and on, and they aren't emotionally available for this conversation. 

I know it was a long read, but I was just wondering if anybody who has memories of very early trauma like this, maybe had a similar romantic trajectory? 

 I'm just wondering if and when I'll recover from this, because it stinks, and it makes me sad. I don't know if I'm ace, traumatized, or if there's an overlap of life long symptoms and SA abuse, sorry if this was upsetting to read!

Have you tried going NC with a parent? Would doing so be considered a form of splitting? ,1713892166.0,"Update: I phoned the parent and expressed my need to take a break and reduce our interactions, explaining that I couldn't pretend to be on good terms as they wished. They were taken aback and questioned why. I explained to them that I was grappling with the trauma from my upbringing in their house. They responded by asking if it was so awful, how come they and my brother are doing fine? They also suggested that others have it much worse. I interrupted them, stating that their remarks were incredibly invalidating. In a final attempt to dissuade me, they questioned how I could manage alone in an entirely different city and how they could ensure my safety. At this point, their concerns no longer register as genuine worry for me, but rather as a means to maintain their comfort and absolve themselves of guilt for their role in my struggles. I'm triggered but relieved I made this decision.



My situation isn't straightforward, mainly because my remaining parent isn't entirely negative. For context, a therapist once told me that this parent exhibits some unhealthy behaviour (a lot of guilt-tripping, emotional abuse and control), which I agree with. I've been living in a different city for about a year and have stopped visiting them. We occasionally text, but I increasingly feel they're trying to smother me with their attempts to mend our relationship. They seem to listen and acknowledge my feelings, but the conversation typically ends with them wanting us to be on good terms. While I understand their desire, it feels like they're glossing over the real trauma and the decisions that have led me to my current situation.

However, since moving out, I've become better at recognizing how they've wronged me and at setting boundaries. I'm wondering if going NC would be too severe? I'm eager to continue growing, but I feel held back by their expectations and the emotional weight they place on me. I'm not ready to give what they want without first processing my trauma. Is NC a form of splitting in this case?

When is it time to breakup?,1713528971.0,I have been in my only serious relationship with my boyfriend for the past year and a half. We fell in love after being friends for a while and had the best time together for a whole year. We started long distance in september and the time difference between us is 6-7 hours me being on the bitter end of the later time. It was going smoothly the first 3 months cuz I was looking for jobs and I had no issues staying up till 4-5 am just to talk to him. As soon as I got a job it is 12 hour shifts yet I make the most time possible to call him and communicate. I went back after those 3 months to see him for a month and things went smoothly mostly until he started lacking on making time to see me or call me. There was a snow storm and he knew i was out with no car bussing for 4 hours and he didn’t bother to ask to pick me up even though he was off work early. Now I went back to long distance and since then the calls and texts were far in between it started to bring out the worst in me. I lash out on him and get angry especially when i have bad days because he is not there for me and I always told him how communicating consistently for me is everything. I still feel attached to him because he always apologizes and promises to change his ways but it just gets worse like who can go a whole week without calling their significant one. There is just 0 valid reason for that. I tell him i am miserable in the relationship hoping he would fix it but again that doesn’t amount to anything. I almost died on a flight because of bad thunderstorms and I got traumatized badly then i tell him all he says “well I am glad you are doing good now” I don’t know how long I should be sticking by him if that’s the way he acts. He only asks to call as if he needs my permission when i get pissed at him but never just out of his own will. I am tired and emotionally drained. My BPD is off the charts now and I cry at every little thing. I want to end it but in my head i think nobody else is gonna love me because I am full of flaws.

How do you get know if you’re projecting or not? I asked chatGPT. The response made me realize that I might. What now?,1713518997.0,"Here’s the response I got: 

Projecting involves attributing one's own thoughts, feelings, or traits onto another person. Here are some signs that may indicate you're projecting:

1. **Overly Critical of Others**: If you find yourself frequently criticizing or judging others for traits or behaviors that you dislike in yourself, it could be a sign of projection.

2. **Strong Emotional Reaction**: Feeling intense emotions, such as anger or resentment, towards someone else for reasons that seem disproportionate to their actions may indicate projection.

3. **Denial or Rationalization**: Ignoring or denying your own feelings or behaviors while focusing on those of others, or rationalizing your actions by attributing them to someone else's behavior, can be signs of projection.

4. **Repeated Patterns**: If you notice recurring patterns in your relationships or interactions where you consistently attribute certain traits or motives to others, it may be worth examining whether you're projecting.

5. **Lack of Self-Awareness**: Difficulty recognizing or acknowledging your own emotions, desires, or flaws, while readily identifying them in others, can indicate projection.

To address projection, it can be helpful to practice self-reflection, increase self-awareness, and explore the underlying reasons for projecting onto others. Therapy or counseling can also be beneficial in gaining insight into these patterns and learning healthier ways of relating to oneself and others.",NightStar_69,,False,1c7sm45,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1c7sm45/how_do_you_get_know_if_youre_projecting_or_not_i/

I’ve been going to therapy since January and I’ve started EMDR along with setting boundaries for myself.

I am trying to avoid a mental breakdown. It has taken me a really long time to recognize the signs of that happening within myself. My thoughts are overwhelming me as of late and sometimes I just need to talk to someone. Most of the time I let it build because honestly nobody really understands Bpd. I also don’t want to bother anyone with my feelings because it doesn’t really matter, I don’t really matter. The only person who would listen and understand and be there for me was my best friend of 16 years. A few years ago she passed away and since then I haven’t talked to anyone about how I’m feeling or how my thoughts are eating me alive everyday. 
I have a boyfriend, who I do love but he is extremely emotional unavailable and gets frustrated or just thinks I’m trying to argue anytime I try to talk about how I feel or what’s bothering me. So I’ve been holding everything in. it’s getting to the point where I can’t breathe sometimes. 
Idk I guess I wish he would listen, and I wish he would share his emotions with me too. Communication is really important to me, and I guess I feel like he doesn’t try to communicate how he feels or even care when I try to. 
I have no friends and I never really have besides my friend who passed away. She was my fp.

i believe i’m so worthless that i’m close to getting kicked out of my therapy. average people don’t get kicked out of therapy 

i’ve already been kicked out of an ocd support group before because it was a video call online group and they thought I was a troll, but really it was just a misunderstanding, and I honestly maybe wasn’t very far from being kicked out of inpatient in a hospital because I wasn’t adjusting my hygiene habits in line with the rules of the program (they were just overly-strict about it)

Am I evil ?,1712787254.0,"22 F. Diagnosed at 17. 

I act out. Irrationally. Violently when I’m super angry. I’ve threatened people. Said such foul horrendous things to people. Used their insecurities and fears and personal history against them. Gaslight them. Said mean things to make them cry and feel small. 

It’s gotten way less since I stopped drinking; and mostly seems to be triggered by romantic interpersonal relationships. I was emotionally, verbally & physically abusive to my last two exes. 

I was angry at a guy I was recently involved with and was kinda holding it in acting like everything is okay. Then he came over and he tried to take my vape and I told him give it back and he didn’t and I tried to get it from him and I think he thought we were play fighting but I was  kinda irritated and when he wouldn’t let it go I bit him. So hard and it scared me how instinctive it was to hurt him. 


But recently I acted out and I’m scared that I’m just inherently bad, or evil. 
I showed up at someone’s house cause I was angry that they’d said something about me behind my back . I didn’t do anything physical but I sent horrible messages. But my friend who tried to stop me ended up getting into a fight with one of the girls there and I know that the altercation wouldn’t have happened if I didn’t act irrationally and go there.  And now my friend is in trouble with our institution. 

I don’t know why I’m like this. Sometimes I’m just mean/attitude to people, and it’s like I’m the moment I know I’m giving an attitude and I don’t know why! Like I’ll make small little comments that are mean. I hate that I’m like this. I wish I could be nice naturally and I didn’t have to try. I wish I wasn’t evil 

I’m in therapy but I’m scared. Cause even with my first ex I was in therapy and thought I’d change but I didn’t in my next relationship I was the same. 

& now recently having acted out in a friendship situation I’m scared.

I’m scared I’m just evil and gonna keep hurting people. What if I don’t really have BPD, or CPTSD and I’m just actually a shitty person 

The shame and guilt eats me and it makes me anxious thinking about the ways I’ve probably made people feel. 
Then I just start feeling like maybe it’d all be better if I wasn’t here. 

Idk I don’t know what this is but I feel like I’m a shame to the BPD community.
Cause how can I know what this feels like and act that way towards others . 

And in the moment it’s like I know it’s wrong but I can’t help it and that makes me feel sick and depraved. 

I heard narcissistic personality and BPD are similar. What if I’m just a narcissist? 

My mum once told me that I was a manipulative spiteful and ungrateful child; and maybe that wasn’t traumatic. What if she was just actually saying the truth. 

I’m scared I’m gonna hurt everyone.

Doing really well for a bit, was stable(f21). Then I got thrown for a loop having to transfer to a dif science class in order to graduate on time and now have to play catch up, keep up with my other class, and manage a full time job with a five day school week for the first time in five years. I split on my dad last night, this isn’t uncommon since he also behind closed doors has told my mom believes he also has borderline. We are one in the same lmao, but he’s one of the most caring and sweetest people I’ve ever known during his good moments, so it hurts especially when the smoke clears in my head after a split. It was especially bad, I told him he doesn’t understand anything about me or my fears. (I’m queer, and a survivor of dv, stalking & planned assault), and most regrettably I told him that he wouldn’t care or understand until I was dead and to not pretend to care after. I feel sick and a lump in my throat at that. 
Today, my plans with my best friend to study for an exam in my science class tomorrow got thrown out the window cause of stuff out of her control. But because of the bpd and autism, I caught a bit of an attitude with her. I split momentarily, but did not take it out like I did with my dad. But she knows me well enough that she could tell something was wrong. 
I’ve called my dad, and we talked for a good hour and plan to talk more. He accepted my apology and understands, as I said he’s in the same boat, but it doesn’t excuse it. He’s on a trip right now and I want nothing more than to help him. 
I texted my friend , she’s asleep, and I apologized and told her she did nothing wrong and I was probably going to be quiet for a couple days.

What coping strategies worked for you?,1712724801.0,"Hey all, this is my first time posting on reddit so I hope I'm doing this right. Also, just a quick warning for mention of suicide and ED's.

I was around 15/16 when I was first diagnosed with BPD and transferred to a specialist. I've been coping alright since (I am now 18), and l'd thought I improved quite a lot, however as of late l've noticed that l've fallen back into old habits and rather detrimental thought patterns. I've been especially disregulated the past few months, undoubtably provoked by a relapse in my disordered eating. Right now, my emotions have plateaued, and I'm able to think critically about my situation with a clear mind, so I'll use that as an opportunity to reach out and make some progress.

I'm operating under the assumption that my restrictive food intake has been the stressor triggering my states of emotional disfunction, however my ED is a seperate problem that runs so deep that it would be very difficult to just 'stop’. Because I'm not able to remove the trigger, I'm looking for ways to manage the resultant emotional tailspin.

Yesterday was definitely one of the worst yet - my head was clouded with blatantly untrue thoughts about my family and relationships which pushed me further down the pit of self isolation. Despite being in an objectively good place in life, l'd convinced myself there was no future for me and I had nothing to live for. That was probably the closest l'd been to actually going through with my plans to end my life since my last attempt in early 2023. A few hours pass, I listen to some music, and I feel fantastic. Super productive, I'm on top of the world and nobody can stop me. It's exhausting being stuck in this cycle of utter despair and what I can only describe as borderline narcissism. It feels like my brain is split in two, and I just can't seem to get that horrible part of me ur control. It's a constant battle between critical thinking and utter delusion. 

My friends, family and therapists are fantastic, but as bystanders they can only do so much. I have EMDR booked for the end of the year, but in the interim I need to lock in and really commit to my personal development. My question is, does anyone have any coping mechanisms/ self-help that genuinely worked for them? I don't care how niche or odd it may be, I just want some advice that isn't ""read a book"" or ""go on a walk"" - not that these aren't valid control strategies, it's just difficult to convince your mind to go on a walk when you're consumed by hopelessness.

I want to get better. I cannot keep living like this, it's hurting the people I love and corrupting my mind. So, please let me know what helped you. Anything is appreciated.

is there hope to recover?,1712584938.0,"hi all,
unfortunately I’ve found myself in a whirlwind of bpdlovedones posts, trying to listen to podcasts about bpd (drs are saying the cruel, stereotype type things about bpd), and im wondering if anyone’s actually recovered? How? How did your relationships change? am I stuck in this forever?


I (23f) have been diagnosed for 3 years, and reflecting, recognize how and where my bpd has come up, where it’s been prevelant and caused issues in relationships.


Here’s the thing. I’m currently with a new(ish) (5 months) partner (23m), and it seems like it is a safe place. He knows about my bpd, he tries to understand, he sets boundaries, he asks questions, he knows im in therapy yaddayaddayadda.


Normally, I have pretty quiet bpd, I don’t lash out (I did when I was a teen), I bite my tongue when I split, I realize when im devaluing someone and don’t make rash decisions I know I’ll regret. However it obviously still comes out sometimes. It looks like it not seeing the other side, taking accountability, seeing im wrong, stuff along that nature.


But, when I do come around and realize maybe I was wrong, I feel so much shame and saying “im sorry here’s why I was wrong” feels… vulnerable?? I don’t know what my issue is haha. I’m not sure how to describe the feeling of 


Nonetheless, I have been trying to slowly recover, I have started a new intensive therapy program, im trying. But I feel like im messing my bf up along the way. I know every relationship has shit to hurdle over in the beginning but I feel like it’s more aggressive for me because there’s a name to the reason for some issues (bpd).

I hate being self-aware,1712510423.0,"As the title says, I hate being self-aware. I don’t know exactly when or why it happened, but it’s like I came into consciousness a second time. Realizing that I’d actually been a horrible person to the people that I loved and loved me. 

It’s been 4 1/2 years now, and every moment of it has been misery. The guilt, the shame, the realization that I have this horrible thing that I never even asked for. That I never experience GENUINE happiness. That no one will love me as much as I love them. There will always be an uneven dynamic in my relationships. That people can read up on BPD all they want, but unless they have it, they won’t understand. 

Every single day is a battle. Within myself. I am conscious of how my disorder affects me; my thoughts, my emotions, my reactions, my physical body. I am my own fascinatingly sad science observation. 

I have to decipher and process what I’m feeling and why, all. the. time. 

I am exhausted, I am sad, I am angry, I am empty. It always feels so hopeless and helpless. The work is so hard. It feels like one step forward, 10 steps back. I just wish I wasn’t like this.

The mood swings, the guilt, the shame, the rage, the physical pain, the emotional pain that feels worse than death, the mania, the absolute apathy, the knowledge that I can manipulate anyone to get what I want and be incredibly selfish, knowing that I did that in the past is just horrendous. 

I do feel bad for my partner. We’ve had rough patches in the past where he’d sought out other attention because I guess I was too emotional. He has become everything I wanted and needed in the beginning. We were apart for around 7 months? I don’t know. We came back together, he moved, and he’s not sure of the future.

And I get it! I simply would not want to put up with me and my own self-torture. 

The fact being that relationships make the bpd worse is horrible because I don’t want to be alone, I want to be loved, I want to love someone, I want to feel safe and wanted. 

I’m even having to go low contact with my mom because she’s incredibly narcissistic and it’s exacerbating the already rough situation I’m in. Getting out of the military after 10 years, moving to a place I hate because of them, working a job that takes up all of my time and I hate, leaving all of my friends behind, trying to accept the fact that my entire adult life as I knew it is over, my partner having to leave (he’s also military), and being unsure of us. 

I can’t deal with it all. And the fact that I have to minimize contact with my family because of how they choose to treat me is even harder because I really am *alone* in this. 

I just hate it. I would love to go back to being ignorant and delusional, unaware of any of this. 

And on here, in another subreddit, I see people talking about their pwBPD like we’re all just some sort of selfish, horrible monsters. It honestly makes me never want to attempt to get close to anyone and confide in them about this because there is such contempt held toward us by people everywhere, thanks to the internet.

Sashbear training saved my relationship with my loved one (teenage daughter with BPD),1712404893.0,"I have a loved one with emotional dysregulation and Sashbear (Canada) provides DBT training  (free of cost and self referral) to family members, partners, people who have a loved one with BPD.

Their webpage ([Sashbear.org](https://Sashbear.org)) states ""Empowering family members and communities with life transforming skills and hope, through workshops and evidence-based programs at no charge"" 

Their 12 week (2.5 hours/week plus homework) program teaches emotional regulation and problem solving skills so that family members can get off the emotional roller coaster that often takes over daily life.  

I completed the course 2 years ago.  After the first meeting I had hope, real genuine hope. After the second meeting, I realized, that I was going to have to change my personality and it was not going to happen overnight.  

For the first time, I am able to respond to my daughter's outbursts with a genuine calm state of mind and I am able to help her manage her emotional dysregulation rather than making the situation worse. Instead of focusing on her dysregulated behavior in the moment, I focus on understanding why the behavior happened in the first place. Our relationship or overall family connections has improved such that we say ""Love you"" multiple times a day and that especially helps to defuse blow-ups. 

In the past year, there was an emotional dysregulation event that resulted in my daughter saying ""I hate you!"" with an intensity that was unmatched to previous versions. I felt like I was struck with a load of bricks. Rather than responding immediately, I left the supper table and excused myself for 3-5 minutes. After a few deep breaths, I came back to the table, sat down and told my loved ""You said that you hate me, but I love you. I told it too you yesterday, I am telling you now and I will tell you again tomorrow. I know that you love me because you said it yesterday and the day before that. I understand that you are frustrated with XYZ but you are in a dysregulated state of mind and when you are there you are going to say things that you do not intend to say. It's okay, we will talk about this later when you are calmed the fuck down. okay?""

After I said this, there was a fearful expression on my daughters face as she realized what happened. Her hateful words were not true and she had no power over my emotions. She has not said it since, although she tells me to F-off a couple of times a week (when dysregulated), but I ignore it.

My daughter's upcoming BPD life challenges are not going to disappear, however at least I can support her in a meaningful way and protect my own mental health.

For those with BPD in Canada, please recommend Sashbear to your loved ones so they can help you to manage your BPD in a loving and supportive manner that protects and enhances their own mental health. 

The Sashbear training modules are the same or a slightly modified version of DBT training skills. This can be very helpful for those doing DBT training for the first time,  as other family members can also put the DBT skill set into practice. The more you practice, the more it sticks.

Sashbear also has an expert series of youtube videos covering many different topics.

"Giving up hope= peace? (TW: suicidal ideation, overlong post)",1712388846.0,"I’m currently in Pokhara, Nepal on a work trip (teaching and performing theater) and stuck in he hotel with a rough sinus infection.  I found this in a bookstore here and those four questions made me think about living with BPD. 

Context about me: diagnosed in 1993, many years of many medications with intermittent success. Moved overseas and built a new life and business in 2007, married the love of my life and enjoyed a decade of life but was unmindful of my emotional volatility and how it impacted others. After moving to yet another country to grow the business in 2019, the pandemic led to bankruptcy and my wife leaving me and beginning a clear plan to end it all. Fortunately I was introduced to DBT and IT WORKS WHEN I DO THE WORK… but when things get extremely difficult it can be overwhelming to do the work. 

I’ve lost most of my close friends due either to distance or them being overwhelmed by me being ‘too much.’  I have been living alone now in the second country for a while, and over-working to fill the emptiness (and to try to pay debts and build some sort of financial stability). My DBT therapist declared I’d mastered the skills and was changing his business model, so that relationship ended two months ago. I wished him well and lied that I don’t fantasize about suicide any longer. I enjoyed the healthiest living relationship of my life for 6 months; yet we began knowing it would end when she relocated to the other side of the world. Although I was a much better partner to her- even so, at the end, she shared that I left her very little emotional space because I took up most of it. Now I’m in a third country for another week; much less developed than I’ve encountered, and managing this sudden illness alone. 

I used to think happiness was found in relationships. Yet, my emotional BPD mind (and to a large extent my personal experience) reminds me that everyone will leave my life at some point. Obviously with BPD Abandonment issues, this is a challenging thought to embrace. 

I’ve known all emotions are transitory and impermanent and that DBT isn’t a method to happiness but a way to manage and tolerate our pain and behaviors. 

I crave connection; I want to talk to someone who loves me and wishes to understand me. Yet when I’ve had these people I always eventually burn them out. 

I take things very literally. When my ex wife insisted we would remain close friends I believed her and of course that didn’t happen.  When my ex said she wanted to remain close and always talk, of course that did not happen. It’s hard for me to parse that someone can say something they don’t mean, or that later will be untrue.

Now I’m sick in a strange land.  And I crave conversation and validation and affirmation and love.  There are those that would say they’re there for me but history has shown most aren’t interested in my drama. Even my best friend is dismissive and too busy to talk. 

Then I find this book. 

I now theorize that interpersonal connections inevitably bring pain and suffering to one or both. No interpersonal relationships will last. The idea of joy and love and affirmation from others is illusory.  And ‘hope’ is the most destructive and hurtful concept. 

I’ve built a double career based on interpersonal connections - both in theater and corporate consulting. I’m more consistently unhappy than I was pre COVID. I’ve invested so much, and I’m still struggling so hard…. I’m debating retiring from the theater side (although I have a strong international reputation) and focusing on consulting and training and money.   This is something I’d prefer to talk through with a loved one… but my best mate said I’m ‘just spiraling’ and a person I’ve begun dating told me to ‘calm down.’

I don’t expect others to make concessions for me. And although my diagnosis isn’t my fault; it’s my responsibility to manage how I impact others. 

Maybe it’s time for radical acceptance- give up hope and understand life for me will be continued pain.

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ,1712379043.0,"Does anyone else consistently feel like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?

Genuinely it’s this horrible phenomena I’ve experienced for almost my entire life. It feels like there are 2 different people inside of me.

I’m Dr. Jekyll in the ways that I’m calm, I can be social, I have dreams, I enjoy having friends, I care about my health, etc.

My issue lies in that I feel like I’m constantly keeping Mr. Hyde at bay. 

Mr. Hyde is not me. I don’t know who he is or where he comes from. Every now and again his horrible urge takes over me. It’s the worst thing ever. The worst part is I FEEL like I’m still in control but somehow the Mr. Hyde part of me takes over without me realizing and “he” wreaks absolute havoc on my life. I’m mean. I’m absolutely vicious. I say rude things to people I love. I treat the people I love with disrespect. I turn into someone who is not fun to be around. I become a person that I do not want to be around. 

The worst part is when I finally calm down and come to my senses I’m left with Mr. Hyde’s mess. I feel like I’m constantly looking back at my actions and doing damage control. 

I don’t want to do damage control anymore. I just want to stay in control. 

How do I prevent something I don’t know is happening until it’s already happened?

BPD & ADHD,1712258208.0,"Hi guys :)

I (27f) was diagnosed with ADHD when I was around 9. My parents didn't really believe in therapy so they kinda forgot about it, never did anything with it, and haven't told me about this diagnosis until a few years back. I've been diagnosed with BPD for 10 years. I mentioned the ADHD thing to my psychiatrist but never really focused on those symptoms as I've always been more preoccupied with the BPD symptoms.

Now, I know that ADHD could be mistaken for BPD and the other way around, but I definitely have BPD, so let's not get into that.

**I wanna ask those of you who have been diagnosed with ADHD/ADD if you're taking** (or were in the past) **any medication for it? How did it work with the medication prescribed for BPD** (yes, I know BPD can't be treated with medication alone, but again - let's not go there)**? Did it make your life easier on the BPD side of things too? And in general, did it make your life easier?**

I'm tired of having to work/study twice as hard as people around me to achieve the same results. Among other things. But this is my main issue atm.

If that makes any difference, I take Effexor (venlafaxine) and trazodone.

"More tears, healing sucks.",1712045000.0,"They come in waves, I've stopped drinking again so I believe I'm transitioning into another step of grief. The flash backs of insults and splits are so vivid. (Ex PwNPD) we were the poster children of a toxic relationship. Addictions obsessions longing burning codependent proud angry broken resentful yet completely enamored, utterly in love, and desperate for that fairy tale of a happy ending. 

I have another session coming up soon... I don't think anymore medication will help this go around. Btw they're all non addictive and really has helped! Recommend if you're really taking your recovery seriously. Time heals. I hope it doesn't take too long because this shit sucks. I read it can take years to get over an ex. How ever long before the heart break subsides I know I'll be happy single or in a relationship. I'll be happy with me, in myself. I'm really thankful that's the mindset I have about all this.

I don't think we can recover where there's past hurt. We need to be alone, for me at least. It's hard to heal in the same place where your heart was hurt. Not possible. 
(However all the love and respect to those of you with supportive partners. I envy you in the highest regards to have that team like relationship. Many blessing to you and your respective families.)

I will say it's lonely as fuck, there isn't anything more my friends or family can say, they're sweet and empathetic. Coping the healthy way is so difficult, it's raw and ugly. Not filling the ""void"" combing through past traumas and letting those feelings flow and wash off of me, seems never ending, but it's better than being broken better than trying to cover them with a fresh coat of paint. Better than being a victim, better to fix than to cover up the ugly. Renovations take time, there will be setbacks, but the plans are in motion and the project will get finished, eventually. ❤️‍🩹

how to work on attachment,1711942056.0,"Hi. I (20F) just got broken up with by my ex (22M) last night and have been NC. It's a very long story, but he ended things because of my behavior in the past few months being toxic and harmful. He said he loved me, he didn't want to do it, was ugly crying with me, but it was done anyway. Over the course of our nearly 8 month relationship, major life events happened, I lost sight, and he ended up becoming my Favorite Person unintentionally. 

I have been in bouts of crying, but I have been talking with many people and have a rocky plan for the foreseeable future. First, I have CBT and DBT in the next two days, and then on Wednesday I'm going to the doctor to switch my medication (cymbalta) to something else that will target mood swings. I am going to join a grief support group to manage the grief I felt these past couple months. I've written out the toxic attachments I developed and boundaries that we had at the beginning that fell away. 

I'm going to stay NC until Friday, wherein I'll reevaluate everything, but I don't know how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? I don't have these issues with anyone else in my life, only my romantic partner(s), and until the shit of life hit the fan, I was navigating my attachment very well. 

He is truly the love of my life, and we had so many things planned together. Everything was mapped out, and I was so secure with him. I believe when things went down that I used him too much for emotional reliance and we became a tad codependent. We are both anxious attachment, I think, and I have BPD whereas he does not. I do still love him, though, and I want to firstly work on my own issues for a while, but I do want to be with him again, if he'd try us out again.

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for me on how to work on the attachment issues without being in a relationship? Or just any advice in general? 

edit: broke no contact. found out he and his sister are leaving town for a while, so I left him a voice-mail last night telling him to stay safe and that I miss him. said I love you. texted his sister a similar sentiment. the lack of response really feels like I just tore my own insides out, but I suppose that's the decision that's been made. I dont want to lose him, and I feel I already have

edit 2: talked to my dr. the medication I was on for my arthritis gave me psychosis, and my rheumatologist didn't check my mental history before prescribing them. I stopped those, started taking prozac instead of cymbalta, and started 3 omega-3 fish oils, 1 vitamin b1, and 2 magnesium glycinate. i had a phone call w his sister a few days ago and she said he isn't ready to talk yet but it was fairly amicable. sending a text tmrw for his birthday but haven't reached out. going to the psychiatrist in a few weeks to get mood stabilizers. ive done a lot of journaling, therapy, and talking and distracting. I know I can thrive without him and I don't NEED him to survive, but I do love him and he enhances my life. I want us to work out, but I'm not going to spam or go crazy w the contact.

1am wake up thoughts,1711762158.0,"F 25. Just woke up and I have been uncontrollably crying. I was diagnosed with BPD around a year ago and have been in therapy since. Various shitty things in life have happened to me, but my first trauma came from my dad (shock!) when he abandoned myself (8 at the time) my older sister and mum for a 21 year old woman. This absolutely broke my mum, she was severely depressed and from this age until I was 15/16 I was always scared she might end her life. My sister became rebellious due to trauma, but I went the other way and hid everything else going on in my life to try and protect my mum from feeling guilty as I don’t blame her at all and she did her best. The issue is that this trauma response of hiding things that I’m going through has made further issues with things that have happened to me e.g. I didn’t tell anyone when I was being bullied at school because I didn’t want them to worry, I didn’t tell them I was self harming at 13 etc and it was never noticed, being groomed online, covered up that my partner was abusing me for 5 years. My mum says to me that she thinks I have BPD due to my abusive relationship. I wish I could tell her everything else but I worry she would blame herself, when the person I blame is my dad for leaving us and not giving a shit, to then have another child and he is a good dad to him. Why did I never get that ? Since then I have had a strained relationship with my dad. We currently speak only about once a month though. When I was in my abusive relationship (ages 18 to 23) my dad cut me off unless I ended it and this also created a lot of trauma for me. I’m now in a situation where I feel that maybe I should say something to them. Or just my dad. Or I don’t know. I don’t want to keep carrying this pain alone. I just want my dad to be sorry and take responsibility for the trauma he gave me. Not sure if even attempting to see if he will do this will just give me more issues.

My spouses feel I mention my bpd too much,1711664525.0,"I spoke with my boyfriend last night that I live with and he mentioned that two of our spouses said I mention my bpd too much.

I try to explain things using things but I always apologize for anything I've done typically I'll say something like ""hey, I'm really sorry I will do my best to improve this in the future. I think that because of my bpd it caused this issue to spiral."" Just an example of something simple I am just doing my best to recognize any triggers or what caused these issues because I'm trying to identify causes and get better about how I react to everything I've only been diagnosed since 2021.

I have been doing my best at recovering and letting go of the trauma I still have from the past and every day I feel I am definitely improving especially since actually getting that diagnosis along with my diagnosis for OCD and PTSD.

They also judged that I don't sit near the partner I live with much but I feel like it makes sense to try and give my other friends and partners attention on the weekly occasions we are around them since I'm with my main partner every other day of the week that we don't see friends/partners.

And the last thing they said is that I apparently make too many mean or self depreciating jokes. My spouse only recently brought to my attention that it bothered him when I made jokes that involved him and I immediately mostly stopped sometimes I forget but it's definitely gone down at least 90-95% and I'm working to make that 100% however my self depreciating jokes don't seem like an issue to me because I'm always just playing around and it's nothing super cruel just mostly stuff like ""if I'm trash then you're obligated to take me out.""

It seems like the only nice things he had to tell me were that they think I'm creative and generous and that I dealt with a money issue pretty well instead of blowing up I sat myself down and calmed myself then had an important discussion.

How to help my spouse with BPD?,1711536460.0,"TLDR at the bottom :) 


Hi everyone! I (M24) have been with my partner with BPD (enby 24) for 5 years, married for 2. Neither of us knew they had BPD at the start of the relationship; only about 6 months ago dots started to connect for them and they told me they think they meet the criteria for Quiet-type BPD. A diagnosis isn't likely at this stage as we live in the UK and the waiting lists are... intense for NHS mental health treatments.

At the moment I think things are a bit fresh, my partner has said that they've just come to terms with the fact they have BPD and aren't ready to look at formal treatment options yet but we've been working on a few strategies, for example we have an analogy we call ""the mountain"" where there are three basic levels on a 1-100 scale (the hyena pit at 1-10, a stable camp at 45-55, and the peak where the air is thin at 90-100). We try to check in about where on the mountain they are before we have a potentially triggering conversation and I'm trying to be more conscious of how/when I say things. They also have listened to Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents and Recovering from Emotionally Immature Parents, both by Lindsay Gibson, which has helped quite a bit prior to learning about what symptoms have been from BPD. 

My question is: how can I set boundaries or offer support and understanding without unintentionally discouraging improvement/healing or enabling? I've felt a few times that there's a fine line between offering accommodation and allowing unhealthy habits to form, but as someone who doesn't have a lot of experience with BPD/BPD recovery I'm not sure where that line is. If any of you have advice on what things I can do/suggest that would be fair and healthy, I'd be very appreciative! Ask any questions in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them!!

I thought our MO was moving on quickly?,1711465494.0,"Maybe my ex was wrong. He told me so much about what would be my life if we separated and none of that has happened. It's going on three months and I'm still grieving a relationship that only had potential. I still dream about him, I dream about arguments, I'm still living with the emotional abuse. On the outside I am fine. Subconsciously I am not. I still feel tied to them. Not ready to move on and I can see through any man that is trying to get close. He really left a sour taste in my mouth, as he was someone who I loved dearly and resented equally. Men are simple, they want sex and praise. But they're supposed to earn that.

I was trying to earn him, pursue him, prove to him I was worthy, the man's role, he was in his feminine energy and I was the masculine energy. On top of that, I was also the women so I did all the womanly duties and gave the sex, the love affection tried to maintain appearances to the point of exhaustion, then told I was fake when in reality I was tired. I was glue in the relationship. I was also the contractor. He had it so easy he could do nothing and watch me struggle and ask for me and I would try my best and fail. I wish he could have appreciated those actions for what they were appreciate me for who I am during my healthy moments. In the end he tore me down into nothing. Anything positive thing I did was wrong and my wrong was wrong, he truly hated me in the end and embarrassed me humiliated me violated me and weaponized an insecurity I was battling with for three months. 

But we're supposed to move on quickly so why do I still cry randomly, why does my hurt heart, he loved me, but he didn't give a shit about me either. ",,,False,1boa47k,6,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1boa47k/i_thought_our_mo_was_moving_on_quickly/

3 year update,1711419710.0,"hey. i lasted posted in this thread 3 years ago now asking for advice again… 

Since then it’s been a lot of ups and downs. I was actually super in-denial of my diagnosis due to the way it you made things worse for me when seeking help through the nhs lol. So i went private and then ghosted my therapist lol. 

Anyways, I’m here now and only starting to accept my diagnosis. I need to, to ultimately get better. I’m in a relationship but it’s hard bc of my bpd (and absolute fear of men) but i’ve been with him for 3 years, he is super understanding, patient and caring. I often feel as if I am the toxic one - i think I am to a degree. 

Anyway the point of this post: I am asking for advice again. What do I do now. I am ready to fight my way through the system again for proper support. I can’t really afford to go private. So any recommendations on how to navigate the system ? Or tips . I just feel like i’m suppressing everything inside now because of my relationship, friendships and work. it’s making me go more into a dissociative state & hallucinations are coming up more frequently.

Feeling pretty confused/lost,1711195126.0,"Hey everyone!

I’m trying to get some insight for my situation- I feel like romantic relationships ending or big fights really do a number on me in a way that brings my symptoms of BPD to light unlike any other anymore. Here’s some context for my current situation and maybe if you have any insight and or advice/thoughts, you can share? 

I’ve been dating a guy for a year. I think it’s pretty clear that we are just such different people in some ways, especially in the beginning. To add to this, we come from different cultures (I’m from the states and he’s from France). He’s in therapy, and I would be if it were more accessible to me at this time. We both work really hard to empathize with each other and be incredibly open. He’s the best partner I’ve ever had except for a few minor details. In the first few months of our relationship, I saw that he had Tinder on his phone (I wasn’t snooping, it was there on the screen when he was showing me something). I tried to be super calm about it and I broke up with him and left immediately. We stayed in contact for the following months but I was pretty set on being over it (something new for me at the time). Eventually, he won me over again and I was willing to come back because I had seen that he wasn’t messaging anyone and that he really was just swiping for validation as he claimed. It took about 3-4 months to recover from that. Fast forward to this past Valentine’s Day. Everything has been amazing, we’ve been great, I had trusted him. In a very similar way to seeing Tinder, I saw that he had many messages from women in his DM’s. He let me look at them, and the only ones he had messaged were only fans models where he paid for content - no emotional or sexual conversation exchanged. This was something i at first thought I could deal with even though it had been an explicit boundary that had been crossed. I’m generally a pretty open person about these things but things but this issue here had been that he lied to me again. 

I’ve been noticing a lot of “i love you, go away” from myself and my reaction. I’m fine and then I’m enraged - because the situation and my feelings are so nuanced. I don’t want to teach someone that this is how they can treat me even if it is a fairly evident act of self sabotage on his part. I don’t feel his actions have anything to do with me and yet I’m so, so infuriated. I want to leave but I want to stay. I want to be close and I want him to show me he’s really sorry. I know my best course of action is probably to leave and hold my ground but I think other bpd people, regardless of recovery might know how this feels. I don’t want to be emotionally violent and draining and yet this situation makes me feel so triggered.

"Lonely, clingy, emotionally promiscuous, hopeless case",1711153169.0,"TW: domestic violence

Not sure why I am writing this. I am 21. And I am losing hope. My borderline patterns started at 12. And they keep getting worse and more complicated with time. Never been in proper therapy. I was not compliant. Never found a good therapist. Was just heavily medicated with antipsychotics. But my patterns? Worse and worse with time. Dad died at 18. No financial stability and abuse at home of all kinds. Writing this post outside of my family house where my brother broke my nose. 

Just following with a convenient psychiatrist for the time. But no real change. Just staying afloat. CBT doesn’t work.

I am lonely. I do not fit in. People mostly bullied me for being autistic. In teen years and adulthood, I was sometimes repulsive. I lost my elementary school friends. I traveled and didn’t contact them for a decade. I don’t make real friends . I just act like a clown and mask. Or trauma dump.

Was stuck in a toxic FP situation for 3 years. Took my emotions and energy and complicated things. Much older person (3 times my age) and was pretty much groomed at 18. Finally left him . I was clingy desperate for a toxic person.

But I am always emotionally promiscuous anyway. Any guy shows the slightest bit of attention, I run into his arms regardless of red flags.

Epileptic and chronically ill. Health not stable.

Realizing I am the problem...,1710911412.0,"This is so difficult. But something just came over me today... I was scrolling TikTok and a lady posted about a video regarding to attachment. That to imagine it is a huge rock, a rock you need to face and let go of. Examine were it came from and why it is there. Etc.

I knew all this stuff before... But this time...something just clicked in my brain! 
Suddenly I felt so calm! I have been panicking the last few days because my partner hasn't been speaking to me because he feels down. And I realized just now, that this is not just his fault .. alot is mine .. I mean.. A LOT. 


It feels like I just decided to take a pair different reality lensed glasses off for the first time in a long time. And I'm confused how I even saw things like I was seeing them.. it's scary to even think about! 


But he has previously told me that he needs space sometimes and doesn't want to talk. So he assumed I will know that next time he stops talking to me for a day or two. But what do I do?!? I blow up his phone like crazy! I panic all day and night! I feel like I can't breath!! And what does this make him do? It makes him ignore me EVEN MORE! Because he is already overwhelmed, and by me doing this, it over spills his emotions completely. Then when he is frustrated at me I wonder ""why is he being so rude and horrible!"" It's because he is so emotionally tired .. and I just overflowed his emotional cup and made it far worse. And instead of apologizing.. I saw it as him being so horrible to me and that he was seeking revenge by not talking to me...and the more he ignores me.. the more unstable I become! And the reason is not even to do with our relationship! The reason is from my childhood... It's not even because I am terrified if I don't hear back from him for awhile... It's because I'm scared of being unprotected, vulnerable, alone, and abandoned as a child with no one to stop the other people hurting me.  So here I am clinging for bare dear life thinking ""how could this evil man make me feel so bad that I want to unalive myself"" when in actuality, I am the only one creating all this... (Okay he has some doing too. Like he should tell me when he needs space. Not just assume. But I feel he has a hard time doing that. And probably because he knows I will blow up on him or constantly call him). I feel like I'm seeing things so clearly now . I never saw it like this before and now I do. It's so weird. And what is more strange, is something just only now snapped in my brain. After almost two years with my fiance and countless therapists ... I understood what they were saying, but only just now does everything appear so clear to me! And it's strange...but all that panic I had, is now going away... How crazy is that?

Proud of myself ,1710809150.0,"
Had some issues today that kicked me off into a spiral.

However I did a deep dive on the emotion and found why I over reacted. I had a mental breakdown 4 years ago that I’ve been trying to process since, today I witness a group of people not exactly prepared for something and it was embarrassing, I didn’t recognize it triggered me to the time of my breakdown and how I clearly wasn’t prepared and messed up on a project, causing massive embarrassment to me. Got out of there when I recognized the change in emotion as I didn’t want a full meltdown, super proud again that I recognized that even.

Sorry this is scattered brained.

BPD and moving past your mistakes.,1710784467.0,"Guilt is something i’ve been struggling with very much as of late.

As a result of my actions and sometimes inaction, I have directly and indirectly caused a lot of pain to a lot of people. I have made great strides to make sure that at least most of those mistakes will not happen again.

And yet the guilt stays. It sneaks up and stabs me when I least expect it. The guilt is my biggest obstacle in recovery at this moment. I know I am not the same person who caused that hurt, but it was still me who did it. I wish I could undo it. I’m trying to forgive myself, as I know I won’t make them again.     

I know simply apologising won’t undo it. It’s why I’m trying so hard, and will continue to as long as i’m alive. But what right do I have to be happy if those people deserved better than my mistreatment of them? 

I feel if I ever came face to face again with an ex-partner or friend, I would break down in tears over how I hurt them. I know that’s probably a good sign. A sign i’m not that person anymore.

Is anyone else also in 12 step recovery?,1710768890.0,"I could use some advice. My BPD is getting in the way of working my program: I've become far too emotionally attached to my sponsor and he's realized that and is taking a step back, which I understand and can appreciate. I know I need to reach out to other people and build a greater support network, and BPD tells me that I only want one unhealthily close relationship. I know I can't recover from either condition that way. I'm also having trouble with continuous sobriety, I always get to a point where I feel empty and alone and trapped and like I'll feel that way forever unless I relapse and I just today realized that that's my BPD coming up so I need to focus on BPD recovery as well.

I'm a lesbian with bpd. Has anyone experienced anything like this?,1710362814.0,"So I have recently been diagnosed with bpd and there are some things I am struggling with regarding my sexuality and how I've got here and I know it sounds completely far fetched but I just need to know if theres anyone out there with a similar experience. I have recently discovered that I am a lesbian but I had only been with men before my girlfriend (who was also just diagnosed with bpd today) and she's really struggling to see how I could possibly be gay which I understand but I just know that I am on the feelings and looking back through my life.

When I was 13/14 my mum went into my school because I was being called an 'anorexic lesbian'. I was very skinny hence anorexic and I liked to hold my female  friends hands. I also used to look at my female friends bodies when they were changing (I know this isn't OK but I just didn't think anything of it). 

When I was 16 I went to my mum and I told her that I thought I was gay because of a specific girl in my school because I really fancied her and wanted to be with her but she told me that 'I wasn't gay but if I was it would be OK' and that 'everyone has those thoughts and feelings about women'. I feel like in that moment she normalised having feelings for women and made it seem like that's what heterosexual women felt. In that moment I felt really disappointed that I wouldn't be able to be with women. 

My mum also used to turn off TV programmes with two women in a relationship in then them and I always really wanted to watch them and have remembered the scenes that I saw from them so clearly throughout my life. 

I then fell down a horrible hole of chasing validation through sex with men because I thought that that would get me love. I created a character that I thought men would want because I wanted to be loved so badly and I thought they wanted sex so I became a 'sweet, cool girl who just wanted sex'. Even though I actually was never attracted to men in anyway. 

Everytime I had sex with men I dissociated to my school hallway and pushed my feelings away. My counsellor said that I was trying to escape to somewhere safer but unfortunately my school experience wasn't positive and therefore I was self sabotaging and punishing myself. I always felt anxious and wrong with men but I ignored my feelings and kept striving to be the perfect character.

I found myself looking at my female friends and their bodies and imagining myself being with them. But it was always like I couldn't be. I knew that I was never attracted to men and I have been attracted to women but because I 'wasn't gay' I managed to get to pansexuality because I knew I wasn't attracted to men but I didn't look far enough to know that actually I was attracted to women and therefore gay.

When I was younger a girl kissed me in a club but I was drunk and she got lipstick all over my mouth and at this point in my life I feel like i was just so far into the character that I was so fixated on being the perfect woman for men so that I would be loved because it was my only option because i 'wasn't gay' because of what was said when I was 16.

I have found myself fantasing about women throughout my life but it was like I wasn't able to be with them and men were my only option for love and I wanted to be loved so badly. 

When I went to my psychiatrist to get my diagnosis he said that because my mum was my primary care giver her telling me that I wasn't gay was a massive part in my life and that I wanted to please her and therefore became characters so that I could be loved and used sex as a currency to achieve this because I thought it's what men wanted.

I will also say that both of my parents are suspected narcissists and my step mum is suspected bpd also. 

When I met my girlfriend everything was different, I thought that she was the most beautiful thing that I had ever seen and everything with her feels so natural and right. And when we had sex for the first time I looked at her and said 'oh my goodness I'm not thinking about anything else.' because that was so new to me, I was actually there and thinking about her and her body and touching her and not just trying to escape in my head. 

When I actually think about what I want I know that it's women and that I'm a lesbian but I'm just so confused how this could be my life and how I could have done these things when I know they're wrong for me. I just need some answers and want to know if there's anyone who has any? 

Basically I just want to know if anyone has had a similar experience as me? Because when I look at my life I know that the feelings with my girlfriend are so different than anything I've ever felt before. And when I look back I can see that I have fancied women but that I pushed all my emotions and feelings away to create this character because I wanted to be loved so badly.

I’m doing really well but I’m scared ,1710335537.0,"
I worked my ass of in DBT 2 years ago. My DBT therapist told me that in EIGHT YEARS of doing the program she had never seen anyone bring in a full diary card since week one. Because I was very young they couldn’t actually diagnose me with BPD but my therapist went through the criteria with me and I met 9/9 to the extreme. 

Before finding out about BPD I felt like I was just crazy I knew there was something more than just anxiety and depression and when I finally found out what BPD was it legitimately saved my life. 

I finally had a word to describe what I was going through I knew it wasn’t just me I found communities that helped me and told me I’m not a horrible monster because of my BPD.

I’m scared that if my symptoms go into remission and I no longer meet the criteria for BPD then that means that all the fighting and begging to figure out what was wrong was for nothing. I’m scared I’ll be dismissed as just a “moody teenager” in future years. But I’m not going to let that stop me from recovering.

"BPD in relationships; Not your fault, still your responsibility.",1710331437.0,"About a month ago, my partner and long-time best friend cut things off with me after a huge episode of mine, which caused one for her as a result. We both have BPD, which is something we discussed extensively before we began to date.           
In the moment, of course, I was inconsolable. I genuinely thought she was my person.     

Yet, on reflection, I realise it was not entirely my fault for once. I was aware that I had screwed up big-time, yet, that episode was one of the less destructive ones i’ve had. Entirely self-destructive, and even then, that was only after i was told some very hurtful things and overheard even more I shouldn’t have, from these people, which actively made it worse.        
It was the first realisation that these people were actively causing triggers for me, and I felt I was walking on eggshells, pretending to be someone I’m not just so I could say I have friends.   

I still tried to make things right, of course. I wasn’t given the time of day by any one of that friend group however. Yet I was actively trying to be better. I was going to therapy, and I was improving. My partner had never been to and refused to despite my pleas. Neither had any of the our other friends present for this.

I guess what I’m trying to say is, don’t stop trying. Our relationship failed due to a lack of communication, powered by an episode I was having which made me unable to talk, and by my partner who refused to communicate afterwards when I was willing. We both had choices, and we both chose wrong.

We were both at fault, and I have accepted my responsibility in its failings. That acceptance has made it easier to move on, and also to take steps to ensure it never happens again. In that month since I have identified things that send me on spirals, and have actually been using the tools I learned in therapy.

Even though I still care for these people, and wish them well, I no longer want them a part of my life. They were unhealthy for me to be around.

Now that I’m in a much more stable state, I’m considering putting myself out into the world again. Maybe I’m ready, maybe I’m not. I want to live anyway, and I know I will never be the person I was one month ago. And in another month, I won’t be the person I was today.

Perhaps it's the lack of chaos, the lack of not needing to prove myself, the knowledge that I was the good in relationship, I was also the bad, perhaps he was catalyst into me becoming whole. Showing me how who I was but also showing me who I wasn't?

So, they hold all the power. “I desire more connection with you,” or “I would appreciate more check-ins throughout the day,” are not boundaries, but requests. So they set all the boundaries and I constantly seek attention and make requests. It feels awful. What does a boundary from a BPD sufferer look/sound like? How can boundaries help me get my relationship needs met when I want no boundaries? And just to add, I don’t know if it’s a BPD thing, but so much “therapy speak” makes absolutely no sense to me.

Don’t go near most BPD forums if you’re looking for advice on what to do.       
9/10 times the people there will just say “They’re at fault, if they really cared they’d reach out”, or “If they really love you they won’t care and should move on”. Among much worse advice more often than now.

Then, forums for other mental illness, or different forums like that one subreddit that shall not be named, will likely shame you for the reactions you have yet to be able to control yet. Is judgement really gonna make things better? No it won’t, understanding one another is the only way forward, in this and everywhere in life.

Extended Period of Severe Depressive Symptoms,1710121932.0,"I don’t want to get into too many details- but to give you the jest of it, I am a 24 yr old female who has been diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, and Addiction. I have fought these for a very long time. The past few months, I’ve had a lot of things go wrong in my life. Career wise, financially, physically, and obviously,  mentally. I pride myself in being clean- so much so that several partners have said something about how many times/how long I spend on my self care. However, I have never been in such a depressive episode. I have not brushed my teeth in literal WEEKS. I barely shower- I don’t brush my hair. I do not leave the house unless I absolutely have to, and with pushing all of my friends away, that’s not often. I have recently gotten back on my psych meds, and I feel they are finally getting me back to myself again. BUT- I have no idea where to start to feel clean and healthy again.

Trigger warning •Abuse • Baby loss • trauma ,1710006796.0,"I’m sorry for the long post but I’m genuinely so lost and looking for some advice. Just a little back ground of myself before I go into depth of the current problems. So I got pregnant at 15 had my kid at 16. Then got pregnant again at 17 only during the 2nd pregnancy it wasn’t like the first at all. My ex partner (both kids dad) assaulted me ways nobody should ever be treated which ended up in me giving birth to a stillborn baby at 17 weeks pregnant cause by his actions. This was in April 2016. I’ve still not healed. I’m not sure if I ever will at this point. The build up to April every year eats away at me like there’s no tomorrow. 

Which brings me to today. My First born is now 9 and like most 9 year olds they start answering back ect ect but when they are being really cheeky ext I see my ex partners face in there’s and it fkin terrifies me. I need to keep reminding myself that my kid didn’t play a part in the trauma that he has caused me but it’s so hard to not see his evil eyes like the day I lost my son. I managed to get her to school today not crying (proud of myself lol) then got home I was having a bad day due to other small inconveniences that had happened. I couldn’t find my earphones in my room i instantly went into panic because i already knew that the only way to calm down was to get my earphones and go a walk. Because I couldn’t find my earphones I then misplaced my phone which lead to more panic. All I wanted to do was escape listen to music and get fresh air. I then instantly felt trapped in my bedroom like I couldn’t find anything everything was going wrong (my bedroom is very small you need to walk like a crab to get round the room) I have no fucking idea what happened but I felt like it was April 2016 all over again stuck in my ex partners kitchen begging him to stop hurting me and I literally felt so paralysed I didn’t know what to do to escape it. (This has NEVER happened before) I grabbed my hair pulling it which released the pressure to my head. I then found other earphones and I finally managed to escape the bedroom. I’ve never felt to scared and trapped in my full life. 

I also got news today that my partners sister is pregnant and is due the exact same day I would have been due with my stillborn. I really really struggled to hold that together when being told

Guilt ,1709921602.0,"Hi you guys. I just found out one of my partner’s ex best friend dropped him and I can’t help but feel guilty. I even couldn’t sleep last night and am writing this as soon as I woke up. My partner and person A used to be best friends but as soon as we started dating he stopped hanging out with them. I feel I may have done something to cause it. I have never told my bf to not hang out with his friends (including person A) but once I did ask him genuinely if his friends treat him like that (roasting excessively) and really thought about it and said yes but that night specifically they went too far. We were at a party and I could tell his friends “roast” were upsetting and making him uncomfortable so I told him to communicate those feelings with them. He did and his ex best friend immediately said that I was putting words in my partners mouth and since then they weren’t talking much. In a span of a year, I learned that he ignores the friend group’s calls bc according to my partner, they drain him. His ex best friend ended up texting him after a long time saying she never knew he would disappear after getting in a relationship after how much she defended him and how she would never drop him (personally I think she was guilt tripping). My partner again didn’t give a solid reason for his disappearance but wished her the best and moved on. 


But I absolutely cannot stop feeling guilty. A part of me wants to over analyze this situation and say I manipulated him to dropping his friends. But a part of me thinks I just helped him realize how his friends really were. I also feel as if this is a situation where they invalidated his feelings and made it about themselves since person A did not let my partner explain his feelings about the roasting and he just doubled down and apologized. This ex best friend would even sub tweet my partner(while they followed each other) saying “imagine being happy after pushing away great friends all bc of insecure”

how to find joy again in the things you used to enjoy,1709792685.0,"hello, I was wondering if anyone had advice for some stuff. TW from here forward for DV stuff and mental issues.

I’m 21, I make art and used to do extremely well in school/college. Over the last 3 years I had to deal with the end of an even longer lasting domestically abusive relationship that ended in stalking at my school.I quit school and my campus job because of it, and lost a lot of relationships close to me as I spiraled hard from everything. I went in and out of psychosis till I got a diagnosis of BPD with Panic attacks in my 20s and got medicated/on and off therapy. I am working toward getting into DBT. 

Because of everything, I’ve found it difficult if not impossible to do anything that will make me happy, or feel confident or proud of myself. I can’t make art anymore, I cant do do my school work. It’s not that I don’t want to succeed, or that I don’t miss it; I physically can’t bring myself to. It feels like I’m going to fail before I start, or like I don’t deserve to do things that make me happy or “waste time”. 

Right now, especially more than ever I need advice on overcoming this. My ex and I broke up ; he has unmedicated and untreated BPD. He split on me, and even if he’s taken it back and acknowledged himself he can’t undo the hurt; I feel like a complete shell of a person. I need to be able to create art again. It used to be my outlet and I crave for it to be again, I’d just like advice for how to get over this immense shame, guilt, fear, and anxiety at actually doing it.

I was ghosted. Will she come back? My plans for the future:,1709364300.0,"> idk how Reddit posts work but I’ve seen those TikToks with the subway surfers in the background lol. I’ll try to format it that way.

> Hey guys. A while back, I (21) met this girl (21) who we’ll call Lana. She is a wonderful person, and I have nothing but love for her. Please don’t be disrespectful towards her in the comments. Anyways, I went through the same cycle that seems to be a common trend with people who are in relationships with people who have BPD. First, she became very fond of me. I was her “favorite person”. I saw her enthusiasm and after a while, asked if she’d like to pursue something romantic with me.
> She was very hesitant, and it took a lot of courage for her to open up and tell me about her BPD. She said that it would be best if we just stayed as friends, and that I should find a “normal” girl who would be better for me. She was confident that her BPD would scare me away. She didn’t want to hurt me. At the time, I didn’t know what BPD was, and Lana described it as though I was about to get myself in some real trouble with her. I was adamant, and I declared that I wouldn’t give up just because of that. The biggest reason she was so attached to me in the first place was because of my resolve. Resolve which would prove to be a double edged sword. Although, Lana told me she found it endearing.
> That night, she made me do some research on BPD. She told me to look into it and to tell her how I felt afterwards. That’s exactly what I did. I got the general idea of it and realized how hard her situation was. Regardless, I contacted her again, telling her that I’d never give up. I promised her that I would stay by her side despite her BPD… this was before I realized how extreme the ghosting could be.
> Lana allowed me to pursue her, and our connection had gotten so much stronger. We would play games every night, she’d watch my twitch stream 8 hours a day, even playing the vods when I wasn’t live. We’d fall asleep on call every night. She opened up and told me about her life, her family, her hobbies, etc… we talked about our ideal future, even naming our imaginary kids. It would have been one son, and four daughters. I wanted them to have her eyes, but she preferred mine. I was so in love with this girl. Genuinely the most wonderful, most beautiful woman I’ve ever met. I saved up some money that next month. I had about 2000 dollars to take her to BlizzCon and pay for all our dinners, and for shopping. We’re both huge fans of Overwatch, and her favorite kpop group was also performing there. It was as if the stars had aligned for us. However, when I contacted her about these plans, she didn’t respond for about a month and a half.
> I was losing my mind. My emotions were spiraling out of control. At first I wondered what happened, pretty soon I became worried. I was scared something had happened to her, or maybe she hated me. I didn’t know what to think, and that fueled my anxiety even more. BlizzCon had passed, but none of that mattered anymore. Eventually I was enraged. She made me promise that I wouldn’t give up on her, yet here she was completely ignoring me when I was putting in all this effort. Regardless, I re-centered myself and continued loving her.
> Pretty soon, Lana came back. She told me she was sorry for ghosting and I forgave her. Things went back to normal for a while. I wanted to be as understanding and supportive as possible. We continued talking regularly. She made me a Spotify playlist which I still listen to. I made her a playlist in return, consisting of mostly SZA and Tory Lanez. We started playing horror games together. It was the cutest thing ever. She was fond of these games, but I get scared very easily, so she loved having the opportunity to comfort me after a good scare. We continued getting closer and closer, then one day she disappeared again after a series of extremely late and dry texts.
> It has been about 3 months since then, and I continued writing her messages every now and then. Recently, a huge problem in my family blew up, and we lost our house. I’m living with my cousin in the meantime, but all the stress is getting to me. My family is on bad terms with one another. I just wanted to see Lana. I tried contacting her again, and she blocked me on everything. I just wanted to do all the things we said we’d do, I wanted a break from all of this. However, despite me always staying by her side and supporting her, she wasn’t there for me when I needed her.
> My best guess is that I couldn’t live up to her idealized image of me, and she started to resent me. Maybe she thought I’d end up leaving her, so she decided to cut me off first. I suppose it’s painful for her to confront her emotions, so she chooses to run instead. Like I said, it’s been about 3 months so I’m not sure she’ll ever return. It’s been painful, and I’ve been torturing myself by holding on, only letting my emotions out at the gym where I would torture my body instead. I made her a promise that I wouldn’t leave her side due to her BPD, I fulfilled that promise. Instead, she left me because of her own internal struggles.

>What do I plan to do moving forward?
- I am going to stop waiting for her. I will move on and stop torturing myself. I will be open to other options.
- I am going to continue focusing on my physique at the gym
- I am going to focus on my career

> I will do all of this, and be a better man for if Lana ever returns, or if another girl catches my attention. I tried to vilify her, but all I could imagine is how precious she is. She’s my dream girl, I don’t blame her for this situation. However, if she does come back, I will express my condition that the only way I will take her back is if she will be more open with me moving forward. I will only take her back if she agrees to confront any problems between us head on, instead of running from them. I will promise that if I see the same patterns as before, I will cut my losses and leave immediately, and I won’t ever look back. If she agrees to these conditions, I will continue loving her with everything I have. In the meantime, I’ll assume that she will never come back and continue living my life the best way I know how. I’ve got a house to work for.

Anyone else realize once you’re healing that the people you surround yourself with suck? ,1709239734.0,"Does anyone else realize that the people the surrounded themselves with kind of suck? As I’m healing, I realize that I’ve surrounded myself with people who don’t really listen, cut me off, don’t engage in activities that make me happy, or really meet me in the middle in general. I think it really steams from feeling unlovable and accepting any attention I got, even if I was the person holding up mostly all of the weight and responsibilities of a friendship. I realize I’m into chess, and hiking. My best friend would not play chess with me, nor even attempt to learn even though I said it would be fun to play together I’ve brought it up several times. Her boyfriend brought it up once, and she brought a chess table and learned how to play with him. It is things like that, that make me feel invisible or merely replaceable. I do things with this said friend that I know she likes, even if it’s not my favorite thing. 

Once I’ve seen it, it’s so hard to unsee. I’m so bad at making friends and letting people go but I’m surrounded by people who think I’m less than even if they don’t think it directly.

It’s getting really bad again,1709225573.0,"
I’ve always had problems with friendships ever since I was back in school and I can’t keep friends in my life at all unless I keep them constantly at an arms length. I also find it really hard to apologise to people when I know I’m wrong, I cannot tell them I’m sorry unless I stop splitting. Something happened recently where my friend told me I was being mean to her and I get I was being mean. I was very overstimulated and annoyed (I’m also diagnosed ADHD) at everyone so I think I started taking it out on her and then she went on to tell me that I’m never there for her and that I need serious help with my friendships because I hurt her and etc because I wouldn’t apologise to her when she told me that she was hurt, I just kept on trying to defend myself and not take accountability for what I did. And I love her a lot she’s a good friend of mine but I don’t think she understands what my issue is but I also don’t think it would make sense to use that as an excuse. She also lives in the same area as I do so it’s kinda hard to avoid her, I just blocked her from social media because I don’t think I want to be friends with her at this current moment especially when I am annoyed and I don’t like being around her. I don’t know what to do. My other friend is also mad at me because of this situation and it really sucks because she wasn’t involved in the first place but the friend I had a problem with went and told her about it and then I went on a tangent saying that they are sitting around and talking shit about me and they all hate me and don’t wanna be friends with me. So now I’m alone again and I feel like I’m in high school  because of all my self destructive tendencies. I also can’t go to dbt because it’s hard getting that kind of therapy without paying a fortune of money. I just feel so alone and I don’t know what to do. Also I’m currently seeing someone I really like and I had to ask for space from them because I don’t wanna take it out on them and I really want things to go well between the both of us.

Finding myself again,1708988892.0,"Hello I don’t know what or how to say this but I’m going to try.

In 2021 I grew the most unhealthy attachment to my “favourite person”. I felt like I was pushed into his arms though from everyone around me. To be fair they were all calling our relationship out and I saw it as a way to “rebel” against everyone. I got stuck In this vicious cycle where he used my BPD to his advantage. Anyway come to August 2022 and my baby sister had just been born, I finally found my escape out of this hole that was slowly killing me. I went back to my mother’s house that night to get myself ready to be an older sister to then be assaulted and broken up with 2 hours after the best thing had happened to me. We ended everything through the courts and since then he’s sneakily came back into my life without showing it. He’ll unblock me and “accidentally” send me things, his friends will watch my social media accounts, his mum will show up to my local shopping centre and death stare me and my new partner. All of that aside in August I started my cycle of self destruction and hate for life, I later made new friends who showed me positive things to do and better ways to think and it stuck with me. I started to heal and grow and it was going great all the way until July 2023 when I lost my bestfriend, he was planned to come and have a holiday so we could catch up. Just a week before he was set to come he got into an accident. I found out through multiple people texting me to ask me if it was true, that moment that I opened my phone a huge part of me stopped living that day, I’ve been trapped in that exact moment. My mental health started to decline, rapidly. I started to take everything out of my family and my partner, at one point my partner had left. I started my recovery again and I felt I was doing great until again another slip in my journey and I started working a depressing job at a cafe where I’m under valued and verbally abused for things I know I’m doing right. I started to feel attacked by everyone, my family, my partner and now my bosses. I took the pain of what my boss gave me and took it out on my partner to then take that anger and pass it on to my mum. I feel like I’m the problem 110% of the times, I’m aware of the mistakes I make but at the end of the day I know what I need to be doing and the behaviours I need to work on I just don’t have motivation to do it, I don’t know who to ask to seek help or advice for this. I don’t know how to see things in a positive light, I’m sad about everything and my sadness turns into “anger” and “attacks” towards everyone even when I’m just trying to communicate my emotions, I admit once I start talking and I get spoken over then I start to split and that’s when I do start to attack and fight.

He is genuinely such a sweet and genuine person and I’m scared of hurting him or letting my emotions get in the way so much that it’s unrecoverable. Keep in mind nothing has happned like that so far, just really worried about it.  Taking this step is big in our relationship and in my life. Does anybody have advice for living with BPD and trying to live with a partner? I’m particularly bad with the abandonment issues & reactions of self harm /suicidal threats when I feel abandoned. I’m also super clingy & he is my only friend. I am at least aware of these things and doing my best to genuinely make a change, but I don’t know how I will react to stuff when we live together.

One of those world ending kind of nights,1708897335.0,"Hi friends. Last night I went out drinking with friends and a friend who I’d had a recent falling out with came unexpectedly. This led me to drinking excessively and ultimately texting her that “I just wanted one fucking good night but you couldn’t give me that. I’ll catch you in my suicide note if I don’t catch you later”

I was drunk and in pain - I’m not excusing it just contextualizing. She read the texts but didn’t respond or call me. Next thing I know 3 armed police officers are knocking on my door at 2am, my neighbors staring as I let them in. They were luckily nice and understanding and didn’t involuntarily institutionalize me. 

Now from what I can tell most if not all of my friend group knows. I texted each of them to ask for privacy but I don’t feel like I can ever look them in the eyes or stay in this city (luckily was planning on moving later in the year).

I’m not even sure what I’m asking for. I’ve had something similar happen before and I know I’m resilient and in a better place (I know it’s still not the best place lol). But I don’t feel comfortable talking to any of my friends and although my mom and I are really close, I don’t want to burden and scare her more than I already have in the past. Any and all advice and thoughts would be greatly appreciated. This feels like a huge “relapse” for the immense progress I’ve made and I can’t help but feel that these past 3 years just went down the drain in an instant.

In a relationship without making them my FP,1708700543.0,"I hope these kinds of blog posts are acceptable here!

I've been in a casual relationship (we both have a lot going on in our lives, and it's too early for a big commitment) for a little while now. Usually, I develop FP feelings for anyone I'm interested in romantically from our first convo. But this person isn't my FP.

That isn't to say I haven't felt FP feelings encroaching. But when I feel these things, I step away, and remind myself all the things I've learned. To not get totally entangled with someone. Of how every relationship before this has just been me seeking the same fear/love skinner box. I come back with a clear head.

I used to think the only way to love was intense, chaotic, and painful, or it wasn't ""passionate"" enough. But we communicate openly about everything, there's no yelling, there's no ressntment. I used to get mad when an FP would even mention having other friends. Now, I get so happy for them when they mention having plans to hang out with their friends without me on days off.

I'm so proud of myself for all the growing I've done, and for, every single time, communicating maturely instead of splitting.

My ex is my FP,1708558283.0,"Hi guys! Thanks if you have time to read this. I got diagnosed couple days ago, so all this is very New. 

We were couple 13 years, we broke up 3 years ago and we have 8y old son together. We started our relationship when we were 16y old so he has been my everything always. My behavior in relationship was very harmful, cheating, leaving him and calling him names. 3y ago he decided he was done for good and wasn't patience anymore. I totally understand that. One year after BU i met someone new Who was my FP about 4months. Things ended and it was the first time i felt pretty good by my own, i didn't have FP. Last summer we had sex multiple times with my ex and it started again. He said to me that this was only sex, he doesnt want relationship anymore. Well september he met another woman. And then my begging and bleeding started. It has been now 6months, i can't sleep, i can't eat because i'm so obsessed. This whole thing is killing me. He has said to me that i need to focus now to myself, get better and maybe in the future we can see if we have fresh start again. But i can't leave him alone. It feels like my world is ending every day. I have so strong anxiety and fear of abandonment. He hasn't even abandon me, he wants to be my friend and be in my life and ofcourse we have a kid together. But how to cope with this? I want to wait him when his relationship is over but it's not guaranteed that it will end and how long it takes. They have long distance relationship so it complicates their stuff. I have lost myself with this Journey and i need to find myself again and really get better before he can't even see me as a potential partner.

Everyone with BPD should watch this video.,1708424922.0,"Flashback to when I was 17(f21current), I was falsely diagnosed and medicated for bipolar. I knew something was “off” still, I didn’t have bipolar, but it was definitely worse then depression/regular anxiety. I researched, I needed to know. This was one of the videos I found then, and I remember breaking down and crying the whole time. I’ve never felt so seen.

But my friends especially the end. Because I am an artist who worked in childcare. It was so personal. I can not emphasize enough you MUST watch up till end for one specific line. The message is so important, this was made with folks with bpd in mind and their loved ones to see this.
I got diagnosed with BPD at 20, and it was such a positive, life altering diagnosis. I just needed to share this video with as many folks as I could. Take care of yourselves 🖤

I had a Psychologist assess me, and after a comprehensive analysis, I was catagorized as having an avoidant personality with multiple BPD markers.

I've had depression for years, and I put it down to unresolved childhood trauma, but I didn't make the connection between emotional dysregulation and my depression.

I've been in a psychiatric hospital programme for the past few weeks, and I've been finding the process really overwhelming.

It was suggested I take on DBT and Schema therapy. After also realising how many holistic aspects I need to integrate into my life from what has been covered in the programme, I'm now completely emotionally burnt out.

I'm lying here feeling like a heavy bag of cement, a metal band around my head and an empty hole in my chest. I feel like there's so much I need to do.

how to deal with rsd related to bpd?,1708309690.0,"hi, i've been in self guided recovery since 2020. i got into a relationship last year and it has gone very well so far, but i'm starting to notice some of my symptoms are still here. therapy hasn't been an accessible option for me because of how expensive it is.

we are long distance. this isn't an issue. but she lives with her abusive parents and her sense of physical affection is messed up and she doesn't know how comfortable she will be with physical affection when we eventually meet up. it makes me really upset, i know i will follow her boundaries and she is very willing to cooperate with me and meet me half way because physical affection is so important to me. but i cant help but be upset. 

people in the past have rejected my affection towards them because they just hated me but kept me around anyway for years, them rejecting my affection was simply because they didnt like me. i internalized it and now my brain thinks thats the case with everyone.

i know realistically this isnt the case with her. i know she loves me, but i still have so many insecurities and doubts. most of the time, my bpd isnt an issue and i have no doubt she loves me. but when my bpd flares up, i feel like i live in a delusion and that she doesnt actually like me that much. its almost always caused by us talking about having to slowly build up her comfort with me.

i think the most insane part is that i know i'm going to have to have this process too. last time i was physically affectionate with someone i got so sick that i thought i was going to throw up. i know it's going to be a joint process but for some reason it just doesnt register??

is there any sort of coping mechanisms or self help therapies or even books i can read to help with this?? i feel like its the biggest issue in my relationship right now and it feels like it should be really easily solved.

Struggling/rant tw: suicidal ideation,1708260448.0,"Hi Redditors, 
I have no one to talk to so this is my last resort. I have no family other than my younger brother and I'm currently living in the living room of his friends mothers house with him in one of the rooms. I'm homeless, and also have no friends to speak of. I never have any energy or will to go out because I have social anxiety, I have lost all my hope. I am so exhausted from my life, Ive tried everything to be everything I'm not and want to be but you can't pretend forever, the mask slips off eventually. The housing market in Australia is dog shit, I can't as I 26 yr old woman get some where to live and it seems to be the same problem for 100s if not 1000s of homeless women under 30 in Australia. It makes me sick that no one can have a bloody roof over their heads!
I'm struggling every day with thoughts of ending my life and I can't talk to my brother about it as our mother commited suicide a bit ago.
I have a therapist but nothing helps anymore. I'm at such a low point in my life I feel like I've been in this deep pit my whole life and I've been scratching and clawing to get out but every effort no matter how big ends in failure and depression.
Nobody values me as a person, no one cares, and I don't expect them to anymore. I am so beaten down I gave everything I am to people and I get pushed down, ignored and constantly mocked and devalued. I cringe at the sight of my name, I want to fucking move far far away from anyone and just fucking live and be me, change my name, my look, be someone else. Im scared to put up boundaries so people walk all over me and leave me to pick up the pieces and I know I'm not the only one this has happened to but somehow that makes me feel worse.I feel like a corpse walking, numb 90% of the time. I can't feel anything. I'm bored with myself and my life and where it's going, I don't WANT TO BE HERE, maybe one day I may slip up. I feel like I'm not alive anymore.I feel this pain in my chest everyday and I know it's the emotional pain but other than that I feel literally nothing, I can't even feel anything when I hug Tyson, just this persisting pain in my chest that physically is causing me distress, it feels like a lite panic attack that has persisted from when I left. Just this horrible pulsing pain all over my chest, the feeling of needing to cry but nothing comes out. I think I'm out of feelings and instead my body is taking the hits because emotionally I'm numb.I feel like a piece of drift wood floating in a turbulent, fast running stream, never having a set destination or set path. I go where the stream sends me, seems it has landed me smack bang right where I used to be. That does not feel good, not redeeming. The stream ahead is so foggy I can't see through.

I feel like a ghost wandering through halls full of people, I feel small, insignificant, unwanted and discarded. Somehow through the waves of people, there is one who sees me and he seems to not be bothered by the constant motion, he's mostly happy and bubbly. And I sit back and I wish I was my dog.

Why am I even alive? Just to purely suffer.

Last friday I was at my psychiatrist appointment. A week before it I had a really bad episode and almost unalived myself because of it. Therefore my psychiatrist decided to raise my medication. Before that, I was on 300 mg lamotrigine, 250 mg venlaflaxine with prolonged release and 100 mg of normal venlaflaxine, 75 mg trazodone and occasionally if things got bad I had 10 mg oxazepam. 

But last friday I got raised trazodone to 150 mg and was told to start taking oxazepam daily. The thing is, I am scared of taking oxazepam daily because it really drains my energy and I am currently at uni. Meaning I wouldn't probably be able to study as well as I do now.

The therapist likened BPD to being a reptile that cannot produce their own warmth and need outside sources to feel less empty. They proposed that it is a possibility I will never get rid of the empty feeling or really feel true self-love, but rather eventually curate healthy outside sources (not from FP) that can “spark embers within.” This outlook is both incredibly depressing and refreshing at the same time.

My therapist was spooked by me,1708065236.0,"So this therapist is fairly new with me, about a couple of months. We haven’t really got into anything too deep because I started getting sick from stress and there’s been too much going on so it’s been mostly venting. 
She recently asked me to consider BPD, just as maybe, because of some things from my past. At first I was taken aback but I remained open minded. She told me not to look it up until we can go over it together because I’m a huge nerd and I will obsess over something until I learn everything about it. 

Well of course a few days later I looked it up! And I was definitely shaken after learning more about it, in like a “wow how could I not have known all this about myself before” kind of way. So maybe a couple days later the dysphoria wore off and I began to accept it as a possibility. What’s another diagnosis, anyway? 

Fast forward to today, like I said we still haven’t got into anything too deep yet. I was telling her about how my mbti has changed three times over my adulthood I’m 35f. (I went from INTJ to INFP to now INFJ) And as I was explaining all this she started sinking in her chair and started looking at me like in a quiet terror kind of way. Like she was looking at a serial killer. I stoped my train of thought and asked her point blank “why are you looking at me that way?” And she straightened out and said she was just listening. And we continued the session as usual. 

But as I was driving away after I was feeling really unsettled to have caused that reaction. Then I was thinking about maybe I was being manipulative by telling her that, and part of me wanted to know her reaction. But I had been thinking about going over that for weeks and kind of wanted to nerd out about why my mbti changed so much. And I just came home feeling really tense and unsettled about the whole thing. So here I am, I guess. Thoughts? 

Sometimes I just feel like I have a huge blind spot. Like I can see so many angles on things but I just don’t get how people perceive me sometimes. And that seriously bothers me. Like I don’t realize how much I affect people or something.

My worst breakup occurred close to 2.5 years ago and it made me reevaluate everything I knew about love so I took a 1.5 year break from romantic relationships and went to CODA meetings, attended therapy weekly (CBT), and graduated from university and got my first big girl job as a school librarian.

Can anyone relate? Any advice? [TW: SH],1707532780.0,"I had a really hard day today.

My bf tried to talk to me about his feelings today. And Idky but I just wasn’t having it. Looking back now he was trying so hard to just be calm and be honest. And I realize now for whatever reason I immediately fell into defense mode. I refused to hear him. And idek how or why anymore. But I convinced myself that my bf didn’t love me or respect me and I went for a walk to clear my head. I got back from my walk and my bf was sleeping on the couch. And that made me mad? Like how dare he be sleeping peacefully while I’m going through so much emotional turmoil. I used that as further proof that he doesn’t love me. And I immediately thought fuck this guy. And I took his car without asking. I was only gone for maybe max twenty minutes. But still I ignored all his calls when he called me to know where I was. And I came home to find out that because I took the car he missed an important work thing. 

It took a while for me to calm down and see things clearly again. But my bf and I talked. And it suddenly hit me. How much terrible shit I did all based off feeling and thoughts that weren’t even based off reality. And then I started thinking about how terrible of a person I am. I mean, who does shit like this? To someone they say they love? It’s actually psychotic. And yet I felt justified to an obnoxious degree the whole time. 

Because of how shitty I started to feel, and how much physical pain I started to feel finally processing that I’m indeed the asshole, I burned myself with my cigarette. 3x too. Almost like I felt I needed to punish myself. And I did it without even thinking that much about it. The pain barely hurt at the time. And it calmed me down. I was on the verge of a panic attack and that stopped it. 

It’s been a few hours since that happened. And now I’m looking at the burns on my arm and I’m so disgusted with myself. I haven’t done that (SH) since I was a kid. I’m a grown ass woman now. And I feel really ashamed for being so dramatic. Like I don’t even feel bad anymore. I feel perfectly okay and calm and my bf and I talked and everything’s okay. But like I did that to myself?!

Another job just not working out,1707304564.0,"I had an argument with someone at work on Friday and it caused me to have anxiety all weekend. My mood has just been all over the place and I think it’s from stopping hormonal birth control and having PMS symptoms again. The argument led to a team lead having a reaction and calling me annoying. She did apologize and we are good. The overall situation that led to the initial argument still remains, though.

Today at a team huddle my manager addressed everyone by saying we are going full steam ahead with changes to the job, and that “outbursts” won’t be tolerated. She said if you aren’t on board with the vision for the place to evaluate if you are happy here and to leave. Thankfully this huddle was right at the end of the day. 

Of course I take this personally considering I don’t think anyone else has had what would be considered an outburst. Im also taking this to mean they will continue to ignore my concern that led to my starting an argument in the first place, because I felt I was being ignored on something I consider a safety issue. 

I’ve been at this position a year. I guess I’m just disappointed in my role in everything. I don’t like the way I reacted and I’ve definitely had my moments. My black and white thinking gets me into trouble. People, especially men, tend not to understand my emotional responses. I wish I could detach. 

On the other hand, I’m actually trusting my gut now. I am acting this way because I am unhappy — so my manager is right. And I should probably move on from this job instead of trying to control everything in it to my liking. This was probably the unfortunate wake up call that needed to happen.

Now I can go back to school and do something bigger with my life. Then I don’t have to take out my unhappiness on everyone else around me. Or at least work a job where my opinion is respected and I’m not called annoying.

Perceived vs real betrayal/abandonment - advice for me and my SO please 🙏 (tweet for reference),1707169567.0,"TLDR; with reference to this Tweet that I showed my bf, he asked when I am triggered and experience this, how can he deal it in the best way possible to avoid as much conflict possible? I honestly don't know the answer to this so would appreciate some advice please.

More context: I (29F) showed my boyfriend (33M) of 4 years this Tweet as it applies to me and I try to educate him about my trauma and how it affects me and how my brain operates so he can understand me better. We are trying to work through and improve our relationship which is heavily affected by my BPD and mental health issues. Sometimes he will do or say things that trigger me to feel/think he is betraying or abandoning me and my brain fully convinces me that this is the case (and I never know if it is real or imagined), I guess subconsciously to protect myself from getting hurt which inevitably does the opposite and leads us to break into massive blowout fights, which ruin all of our progress up to that point, even when things have been going super well for a while and then before I know it we're suddenly on the brink of splitting up and he starts questioning if there is any hope for our future at all. All because of my fucking triggers, disassociations, neurosis when my mind perceives the threat of betrayal or abandonment.

He always claims he is not doing what I think he is and I have no way of knowing if he is telling the truth or lying. For me trust doesn't even matter at this point because after experiencing so many REAL betrayals and abandonments from people close to me who I never would have ever expected to do so, my brain is so hypervigilant and on alert to suspect anyone could do that to me, it doesn't matter who they are anymore. Nobody is safe, no one can be trusted. Whenever I let my guard down and allow myself to trust and be vulnerable, people take advantage of it and then stab me in the back. The pain that occurs inside of me is gut wrenching and makes me withdraw and feel suspicious of people even more.

I am nothing like the person I used to be. I used to be a social butterfly and musician, I could not go a week without seeing friends, going to gigs and performing and ocializing, but since I've been so ill and debilitated the past few years as well as other factors, I've become an empty shell of who I used to be, severely isolated and living a hermit lifestyle. I have not seen any friends in 4 months, back in active addiction, anxiety, depression, BPD at its worst. This is my rock bottom.

I have a plethora of personal and family crises going on constantly piling up (the list just never ends, my whole adult life has been in survival mode), causing me so much inner turmoil, pain, grief, distress, depression, anxiety. I have become disabled by my multiple incurable chronic illnesses, my social life has become non existent, I fucking dread waking upon every next day miserably existing and nightmares at night. It's unbearable to be awake and be not awake. There's no escape, no peace, no way out. My illnesses have stolen my life away and everything I ever enjoyed and loved doing. I have lost all purpose in life, my sense of identity, motivation and any hope of ever being happy. I'm constantly overwhelmed, started self harming for the first time in my life, relapsed on drugs a few months ago (landed me up in the ER one night in Dec) and I'm admitting myself into a mental health clinic for 3 weeks on Thursday before I finish my degree online (there is no way I can study like this so it has to be before). 

I am in therapy, medicated (although I need to adjust/change my meds), but we just had our end of year summer holidays and my psychologist was away for a month, my psychiatrist has become absolutely useless and unreliable and has ignored me since mid December and other times last year when I needed his help (actual abandonment). I've been seeing my psychiatrist since 2020 and he has let me down so badly and become impossible to get hold of, I genuinely don't think this man has any interest in helping me anymore and may have to find another one, starting new after 4 years will be so fucking exhausting.",tabasco_kat,,False,1ajskqw,5,0,https://i.redd.it/lyqzryvl7ugc1.jpeg
Dealing with anxiety better,1707159215.0,"Let me just say I had sort of a breakthrough the past few days when it comes to dealing with my relationship anxiety better.

My BPD is rullll bad right now because my parents died and the grief makes everything worse. My most frustrating symptoms for my partner is how I behave after fights or episodes. I get incredibly desperate for reassurance and I will cry for hours begging for it. He will say things over and over but once I’m in that state I like can’t hear it or it doesn’t help much.

He will start to get frustrated that I don’t hear his reassurance and once I can feel that frustration I will spiral worse and worse. Begging him not to leave me, not to go to bed, keeping him awake before a long work day, crying and crying miserably - and his frustration gets worse and worse.

It’s a bad cycle. 

He always begs me to just “let things go” and “move on” and things will get better from letting go and moving on. But I get so overcome and paralyzed with fear. How the fuck am I supposed to “let go” when it feels like the world is ending? I need to hear everything is going to be ok and that he won’t leave me. I can’t move on and let go and pretend everything is normal when I’m completely flooded with fear.

Well! Here’s the thing that I realized: I’m in DBT and am learning about “turning away” and being willing to turn away. And it hasn’t really made sense to me yet. Because when I’m in that fear mode, it feels like the most important thing in the world. It feels like I’m being stabbed over and over and I will do anything to make it stop. And reassurance makes it stop. 

But really asking for reassurance makes everything worse if I’m not in the right headspace to receive it. 

So it just helps me to think about it like this: when I’m in panic/fear/anxiety mode, it’s like I’m being stabbed repeatedly over and over. Can I handle a logical and calming conversation while I’m being stabbed repeatedly? Can I hear someone calmly give me reassurance while being stabbed over and over? HELL NO! I’m gonna be screaming for it to stop! I can’t hear others if I’m busy being stabbed. 

Step 1.) stop the stabbing. 
- the brain deals with fear by putting all thinking through the amygdala. The amygdala creates stress hormones and creates fight or flight responses. My response to any situation while I’m feeling fear will either be to cry uncontrollably and repeatedly yell until the scary thing stops hurting me, or it will be to shut down the scary thing and run away from it - create distance from it. Neither of those things will make my relationship better. My response fear cannot be trusted. I must bring those frontal lobes back online to be able to respond like myself. 

2.) turning away from the fear and going about your daily activities feels like lying. It feels like you’re ignoring something really important. But you’re not! The fear is there, and putting it through the proper channels will HELP ME handle it without making it worse. I’m going to take control of the situation and turn my frontal lobe back on to deal with it asap. I need to process this situation with the part of my brain that I trust. The more I use my frontal lobe, the more I notice that the fear starts to dissipate. Things relax, they become less urgent, I realize that everything will be ok if i take some time, I can handle this well. 

It feels like a lie. But THIS is how you stop the stabbing. Your amygdala is stabbing you non stop telling you everything is terrible, it causes terrible pain so you can get away from the thing that is causing the fear. So TURN THE AMYGDALA OFF. You do this by distracting yourself, by going about your day, by doing things that activate your frontal lobes, playing an instrument, reading a book, playing a game, whatever. It’s not ignoring the problem or the fear, it is just rerouting it through a brain center that won’t stab you.

3.) your brain wants to stab you. It’s how it protected you in the past. If I create pain, then I will get myself to be able to stop or get away from the stimulus. That doesn’t work anymore. We have to continually reroute to the frontal lobe. Everytime you feel that fear, turn away and activate the frontal lobe. This is how the stabbing stops.

I don’t know if this made sense - but it really made sense to me. I can’t expect myself to respond functionally if I’m literally being stabbed to death. The amygdala stabs me to protect me - but I need to stop the stabbing. I need to reroute thoughts to the part of my brain that doesn’t attempt to hurt me. By turning my attention away from the fear, and towards something that gets my frontal lobe up and running, then my thoughts will go through that part of my brain, and the stabbing will slowly decrease allowing me to be functional again.

Don’t know if this will help anyone other than me haha - but it kind of takes the “FIX IT NOW” feeling off my partner and puts it onto my amygdala. FIX IT NOW by turning away as that reroutes the fear into the functional brain center. FIX IT NOW by stopping the stabbing. Am I reacting and causing problems while being stabbed to death? Theres no reason to be mad at myself about that. Stop the stabbing!",Astrnougat,,False,1ajo9hz,6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1ajo9hz/dealing_with_anxiety_better/

Advice: Dealing with Physical Symptoms of Emotional distress,1706691450.0,"Hello, as the title suggests I am looking for some advice on how to deal with the physical symptoms of emotional distress. 


Maybe 2 weeks ago the low had hit - crying all the time,  having to fight my body so I can get dressed and go to work, struggling with getting house work done, showering, brushing teeth etc. 


Now recently, I had to face great emotional distress and hurt, and on top of that it has triggered everything that happens within an episode physically - I can't eat, I sleep only few hours per day, cannot stop moving, find myself purposefully almost dehydrating myself (where I feel thirsty but just don't act on it for hours etc), feel sick to my stomach and have issues with having an upset stomach, etc. 


The issue is living alone, having a full time job and not really having much of a support system. I tried getting on w my DBT workbooks, everything I have learned in therapy over the years etc, but I also know that until I can address the physical part and start taking care of myself on a ""being made of flesh"" level, the emotional distress will linger.

How do you confront someone on something that annoys you without sounding like you're victim blaming?,1706678755.0,"Long story short, I have a long list of triggers for things that will make me upset and/or angry. Some of those things I do my complete best to avoid or control, but some of them are unavoidable and I really can't stop myself from getting angry if it happens. One of those things is someone else waking me up. Due to my childhood trauma of living in a chaotic home, I wake up VERY easily. The slightest noise or vibration will jolt me awake. Because of this, it's really hard for me to fall and stay asleep. That also means my quality of sleep usually isn't great, and I need all of the sleep I can get without being awakened. I can shrug it off if it's accidental, but if someone deliberately wakes me up before my alarm goes off, I get angry and snappish. And here's where my problem lies.

My partner purposefully woke me up from a nap 5 minutes before my timer went off. I know that doesn't sound like that big of a deal, but 5 minutes can mean the difference between being refreshed and being groggy to me. I ended up getting grumpy and snapping at them-- and while I didn't *say* anything mean, my tone was definitely mean. I know I fucked up, and no matter how upset I am, it's not right to snap at people. I took accountability and apologized. But they said this is a recurring issue, and I don't know how to address it. 

The problem is, I''m never *not* going to be pissed off if someone wakes me up, and as much as I can *try* not to react in a mean way, I may not always be able to do it perfectly or gently. The feeling of irritation is just as much physical as it is emotional. And if I'm honest, I'd rather not be woken by any human ever. I'd rather rely on my alarms since an alarm isn't a living thing that could be harmed by my anger. (Obviously there are exceptions for emergencies and important matters but this usually is not that. Also, before anyone asks: yes, I do always set alarms every time I go to sleep.) I don't think that's an unfair boundary to have. However, I really don't know how to say ""Please stop waking me up so I don't get pissy with you"" without sounding like I'm shifting the blame onto them, since no matter how mad I am, it's still wrong to be mean about it. Does anyone know how I can discuss that with them?

EDIT: Also I know at a first glance this doesn't seem like a BPD thing, but to me, I have no clue how to set boundaries normally. One of the reasons I let it go on for this long is because of my inability to tell people no.

EDIT 2: Since I didn't specify as well, I'm fresh out of an abusive living situation with my father, where he was consistently verbally and psychologically abusive to me and I just took it because I believed I deserved it for still living with him as an adult. I did get the hell out of there, but I'm still getting used to my new home and don't always feel safe. So yes, I'm a bit touchy still. I'm hoping this will improve with enough time away from that situation.",pricklyfoxes,,False,1afa8sc,3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1afa8sc/how_do_you_confront_someone_on_something_that/

Rebuilding trust after cycles of betrayals and trauma,1706614027.0,"[TW: SI, SH]

I have been screwing up in my relationship, largely due to my struggles with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and bipolar disorder (BP2) 

Not excusing myself but they have led to behaviours like lying to avoid conflict (BPD), meltdowns with suicidal attempts and self-harm (BPD) and dealing with hypersexuality (BP2 hypomania), which have deeply hurt my partner and eroded trust.

After the most recent episode, she expressed that she can't trust me anymore. This is tough because I earnestly want to change. I am currently in therapy and have been making progress but still falter from time to time.

Anyone been in a similar situation? How did you navigate the process of rebuilding trust in your relationship, after repeated dishonesty and hypersexuality? Any tangible steps to show my commitment to change?

I am seeking help via my therapist to get access to a sex therapist and taking new meds from my psydoc to manage my anxiety.

hitting rock-bottom,1706439573.0,"I've finally come to terms with my borderline personality disorder, along with other personality disorders that overlap with my borderline (npd, hpd, aspd). And because of that, I'm dealing with severe cognitive dissonance right now from having to accept the fact that I have a personality disorder. I just feel so disconnected from people most of the time. If they don't give me that intensity, or if they don't give me the admiration, attention, and affection l crave, I devalue them. This makes romantic relationships very very painful and unsuccessful. I often dream of material things such as fame, fortune, and success, because I feel as unless I achieve those things in life, nobody will ever love me, because that's how my parents raised me. 

""Mama said: fulfill the prophecy. Be something great: go make a legacy. Manifest destiny, back in the days, we wanted everythingzzz we wanted everything. Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated. All tied up, no more love, and I'd hate to see you waiting""
-Panic! At the Disco.

Because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would because of the awful childhood emotional neglect that I went through being raised by a cluster be mother, I am even scared to pursue my romantic or sexual feelings towards women, even though I'm bisexual, and would prefer to date a girl. I just can't. The attachment feels too intense and I feel too codependent, and it's just too strong of a feeling for me to handle. 

 I am ashamed of the fact that I'm so freaking selfish, and that I have this idea of a perfect partner in my head and it's all almost as if I just want somebody who is willing to just drop everything and be at my aid it's almost as if I just want somebody to serve me. It's very narcissistic and then when they don't give me the attention that I feel as if I deserve, and when I feel abandoned, I act out against them. I just want someone to unconditionally love me. But unconditional love does not exist. It is just a concept. Everybody wants something. Even the spiritual people who claim they unconditionally love people. They're doing it for themselves. They're doing it for that spiritual high for that connection with a higher power. I never experienced true parental love growing up, ny parents were narciissists too. So I don't believe in it. I almost want a partner to chase me and prove to me that this kind of love exists. I want them to be obsessed with me the way that I obsess over the object of my affection--The ""FP"" that I am idealizing at the moment. That is my definition of love, and its flawed.

I have tried DBT, and it actually makes me worse. I hate how DBT is oversold to people with BPD ---almost everybody that I have spoken to who had BPD who tried it said that it did not work for them. It's just a marketing gimic. 

I want to get better, but I feel hopeless and scared.  I know that I probably need to find a provider who specializes in cluster B. But even though it seems as if those people only seem to interpret us through what they read in books, and there's a lot of misinformation out there on cluster B's 

I also need to work with a therapist who could handle BPD and NPD and ASPD. Usually when I tell a therapist, I've been diagnosed with those things, they run. It's like ""oh, your borderline have you tried DBT?""

""Oh, wait, you're also a narcissist and sociopath? Well, then you're incurable. I'm sorry, but I can't help you at least if you were just a borderline you could try DBT""

 I feel as DBT works for some borderline because they're just borderline. I feel as if it's probably my NPD that makes me not react well to DBT.. People with MPD cannot handle that level of introspection. It literally makes my head explode. 

They don't recommend DBT for NPD. For NPD, you really just need serious talk therapy. Think about it narcissist get talking about themselves it's the most therapeutic thing, the world for somebody with NPD lol.

Either way, I just really need someone to talk to you because I feel very distressed tonight and I've been in a serious BPD episode for the past few weeks and I'm just now coming out of it!! despite by resistance to DBT I still am open to treatment and may even be open to going to a DBT group however, I just don't really know if I would be in a skills based group I feel as if I would be better off in some kind of therapy group, where you could just talk about your feelings and develop support.",Actual_Pepper8815,,False,1ad08qo,1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1ad08qo/hitting_rockbottom/

Should I quit preschool teaching if I’m frequently crying at work?,1706235469.0,"I have been a preschool teaching assistant for 8 months. I don’t have a CDA or early childhood education, but I am essentially doing the job of a main teacher with hands on learning and watching more seasoned teachers. I love being a preschool teacher, I find it so rewarding to build positive relationships with the kids, and positive guidance is one of my strong suits. The problem is that I get over stimulated and have anxiety attacks frequently (average about twice a month since I started the job without any experience 8 months ago.) I also struggle with comorbid mental health conditions and I did not attend a regular school (homeschooled) which both make it more difficult for me. I have cried at work from anxiety attacks, a few times in front of the kids, and in front of management, other staff and the director. And I have been asked by management if this job may not be right for me, which I take as a subtle invitation to quit. And I am starting to wonder if I’m trying to fool everyone into thinking I’m qualified to do something I am not. 

As of currently, I am not written up for anything by my boss. And I have excelled in my 6 month review (that just happened because it was late) and was told that I am overachieving in positive guidance and accountability. On that front, my job seems to be secure. However I am well aware that I do not have any education and that I am mentally unwell, which could result in poorly managing the classroom even after gaining more experience and education, if I am not able to self regulate my emotions. I also know that my center only focuses on positive guidance and there are no consequences for behaviors, even with a 3 year old hurting other children 10 times in a day requiring incident reports. Kids are not excluded from care or separated from the kids they are attacking. We teachers (mostly assistants) are expected to manage the classroom and prevent incident reports without ever physically restraining the hitting child. And oftentimes, after trying every redirection and emotional connection, the child is still out of control—at which point we call for management who is only available half of the time. And if they are not, we still are not allowed to restrain the child. In situations like these I will have a  panic attack and start crying, and I have had many meetings with management about it (looking at video to see if we can learn something, talking about what my focus should be like connecting emotionally with the aggressive child to help them calm down etc.) I have had meetings with management that lasted over an hour talking about the job and trying to stop crying the entire time, and then having to leave work still crying once I’ve hit that ten. And while following policies management has had meetings with these parents but not much help. 

I am much better at the job since I started and somewhat better at stress management, but I still fell apart crying twice this month. The reason I am pushing through is because I LOVE being a preschool teacher, I love the kids and I want to pour my heart out to them. I just have way too much social anxiety around other staff, management and the parents, and anxiety working with troublesome kids. This job to me is pushing through and getting out of my shell and trying to grow past so much trauma I have experienced resulting in my mental health. On a good day, I feel I could be amazing as a preschool teacher, and if I were to quit it would mean figuring out what my life purpose is because I thought this was it. Am I struggling because of the policies at my center? Am I struggling because I’m still pretty new at this? Or should I just accept that I cannot handle the stress and find another path?",Active_Morning_370,,False,1ab78dm,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1ab78dm/should_i_quit_preschool_teaching_if_im_frequently/
What is the most effective way to help my partner when her feelings of rejection overwhelm her?,1706213599.0,"I (34f) have been with my partner (33f) for 15 years. She was diagnosed with BPD late last year after months of pretty intense self-sabotage. One of her core struggles is intense feelings of social rejection and not being liked. She's working through self-help stuff as best she can right now and is on a waiting list for DBT. 

I want to support her as best I can but I'm really struggling with what to do when her feelings of rejection sensitivity get really bad. Before, it felt like I could talk to her and reality test her thoughts and she'd be able to listen and calm down. But lately, social rejection seems to send her spiralling and every day feels like a potential crisis. She has a strained relationship with her best friend rn due to her own actions and is taking it really hard. She sees rejection in every small social slight, and when actual rejection happens (like being left out of people's plans or a group chat she's not in) she's so heartbroken. It's gotten so bad that nothing I say can break through the idea that everyone hates her and is actively avoiding her. I just don't know what to do to help her in those moments, and she doesn't know what she needs in those moments either.

I'm now realizing that I can't reality test those thoughts for her, that she needs to do this herself. But I love her and it breaks my heart to see her like that and hear her say how obvious it is that everyone hates her. When she's regulated, she can think through it and has been trying so hard to work on feelings of rejection but when rejection happens, she can only operate from that really wounded place and becomes inconsolable. Tonight I left when she started her spiral, reassuring her that I love her and hope she feels better soon but I don't know whether that has helped or hurt. 

We've struggled with codependency in the past and have worked to overcome it so I'm just mindful of my own boundaries too. It's so tiring and upsetting to hear her say these things, and she becomes so prickly towards me when I try to comfort her. We are having a lot of relationship upheaval right now too, so I'm not the most stable from an emotional perspective. I just want to help her as best I can, while projecting my own mental health as well and would massively appreciate some advice.

I thought that maybe others with BPD might know what has helped them manage rejection feelings, and what kinds of things helps from a loved one in moments like these? Should I be trying to help her reality test? Should I leave the room or stay with her?

DBT IOP vs DBT once a week with therapist and once with group,1705417875.0,"Hi everyone, I was recently dropped by my second therapist (it was absolutely heartbreaking- and still is.) both therapist I’ve had terminated me saying I need DBT. I haven’t been able to afford DBT, but now I’m doing everything I can to complete it. In my city it’s similar prices to go through an IOP or a therapists comprehensive program (once a week individual and once group- so two days of DBT a week.)

The comprehensive is a six month program that is generally recommended to complete twice and IOPs are much quicker 2-4 months but a lot more time.

I really struggle with constant SI and frequent self harm. I can barely afford groceries (I’m a freelance artist and always make rent, but usually with not a lot of money after.) because of my freelance work the comprehensive would be easier, but I could swing an IOP since I make my own schedule.

I was wondering if anyone has the experience/ opinion to share if they believe one option is better than the other. The comprehensive is the most affordable if I do it six months, but doing it for a whole year is actually more expensive than the two IOPs I’m in touch with, so I’m having a hard time making a decision.

Forever right there… 

I haven’t completely forgiven myself yet, for all of the damages and self inflicted trauma wounds that I suffered, it’s best to lay down and let the feelings and emotions pass by then to cope with maladaptive behaviours that did exist once before…its so easy for me to just cope with sex And drugs or trying to control and blame shift on to others, when it’s not anyone else’s responsibility or issue with how I’m doing emotionally…it’s mine I own this, happiness is supposed to come from within, I find it very difficult to be in control of my happiness when I have this stupid fucking mental illness, mixed with depression and autism as well as adhd. 

I want the best outcome for my life but this is the worst mental illness mixed with autism too and the self harming traits that are found on the spectrum…I’m impressed I’ve lived…I'm sorry for those I have hurt either by hurting myself trying to end my pain, and making everyone walk away or walk on eggshells around me.

I feel like a disgusting human though blaming everyone else around me because in my reality I didn’t see myself as having any problems with anything, I know I struggled a bit in school…and in life chalked this up as a learning disability…it’s much more than that… 
I’m learning how to actually love myself how I am…i have mindfulness now to think about my next steps I ask myself this question every time I go to do something new, am I doing this out of self love or not so much, am I really taking care of myself and my actions, and my time, am I taking care of others around me, am I to aware of their needs above my own…are they even a good person, with the heathy way I want to live.

I find it very difficult to stand up for myself as well, especially now since my life has completely collapsed around me…I’m mentally unstable and always will be, with delusional thinking patterns and maladaptive daydreams which honestly make my life more manageable…as well as the dissociative episodes too. I hate fighting with myself day after day it’s exhausting to say the least almost always feel like I’m in crisis. Underneath is a feeling of rage and anger, disappointment and dissatisfaction that would make anyone feel uncomfortable. 

I am and will aim to align myself with what my heart and values are… and what I can to to achieve a healthy lifestyle and learn how to live and trust myself too especially when I’m overwhelmed or doomed with stress. 
I have come along ways with how I view reality, and how my thinking patterns have changed it’s going to be a life long struggle…and others may misunderstood  me and I myself misunderstand me I’ll always be weird and different. 

The reality of my mental health 

Trying really hard not to have a special/ favourite person, I’m not emotionally prepared for another one, I’ve done the most devastating damage with the fp/sp in my opinion, it’s done me nothing but more harm and them too, yes the devastation of not knowing who I am or how to act or how to express myself or my opinions, being misunderstood and mistreated, and manipulated and suffering. I’m not ready to start up a new relationship life again, I’m not willing to open up for just anyone anymore, I’ve done more damage than good ,he’s gotta have knowledge on what my Life looks like for me and knowledge or an understanding of what I am dealing with, before he gets serious… In ways I cannot see myself in another relationship, I have to many narcissistic traits that I have learned from being used. Im not proud to admit or address any of this, I have major co dependency traits and people pleasing too, I’m in constant battle with this, and don’t know how to say no. Im just trying to cope and make it through life no one said it’d be easy. I am focusing on the negatives right now yes, I am labeling myself. I don’t wish to hurt my partner or anyone for that matter…not even myself when I was experiencing no suicidal self injuries. I don’t understand how to have a healthy relationship with someone and have boundaries that are not smashed to pieces, by my partner, not able to assert my own boundaries. Just learned to trust myself. 



 I feel obligated to justify myself to others because I’ve misunderstood myself and others have misunderstood myself for far too long and the same is going to be for the rest of my life.

How To Avoid Splitting,1704931382.0,"So basically this is what I've figured out as I go along on my healing journey. 

One of the reasons why we split is not only because it's a learned behavior but because we don't understand social cues. There are a variety of other reasons such as we don't understand what our needs are, we don't know how to manage expectations, what's normal and what's not. We don't know what our triggers are

This is what causes the absolutes. So in order to avoid splitting I would suggest:

1. Figuring out what causes you to split(mine is sleep deprivation, coffee, a trigger, yelling)

2. Learning social cues
3. Learning communication skills
4. Always ask for intent or clarification 
5. Ask lots of questions
6. Learn about your triggers
7. Tell other people how to treat you
8. Becoming boundaried 
9. Learning emotional regulation or self soothing
10. Ask what intent there is when unsure
11. Learn what your body feels like when your body is about to split

however, what i dont like, & i guess this can b generalized/for anything too, that every single comment if someone is looking for advice, is negative. i truly understand why ppl reply to OPs that way, but they are giving a reply based off their experience. not every person w bpd has severe symptoms, not every person w bpd is the same, which means, its hard to say how any situation will go for the person involving themselves w a pwbpd (i hope thats not confusing). i wish ppl had more hope & werent so discouraging. i really do get it, but at the same time it wont always b the same & thats just what kinda of bums me out.

i love him so much  and find him so attractive sexually and in another ways. but my trauma won’t allow for more than 1- MAYBE 3…  fun bedroom events a month.

To our supporters woBPD: Thank you.,1704495596.0,"If someone you love has BPD & you have taken the time to understand & be patient, thank you. I was diagnosed just under 6 years ago & expected everyone to jump ship at the mention of a personality disorder, & can personally say that without my support system, I would not have made it this long. You make all (& I mean ALL) of the difference.

This diagnosis is scary, & the stereotypes make it much scarier for those looking in. We all know that this is not a cookie-cutter disorder, yet are considered unhinged & dangerous to an extent. People either believe we've got no marbles, we're perpertual babies, or we're constantly on the verge of homicide. It's shitty.

But you guys stuck around. Held us until our bodies relaxed during psychosomatic outbursts, understanding that things can fluctuate & change for us drastically at the drop of a hat - never making us feel bad for saying ""no"" or not being able to handle a situation (or even get out of bed that day), being the ones we feel comfortable to go to when anyone else would dub us as ""crazy"", reminding us that we have no reason to apologize & that if the tables were turned we'd approach them with nothing but love, thus we deserve the same. Without that, I would have given up.

Sorry for the word vomit, my best friend just made me cry (by being so supportive, if ya can't tell), & I'm just still amazed that everyone still loves me & is still so patient & understanding. So, I wanted to thank the whole lot of ya who are doing the same for their loved ones.

You guys are so very important, so vital for us & recieving this unconditional love that we, at times, don't believe we deserve, is truly priceless.

coping with a breakup (advice appreciated!),1704379669.0,"i’ve never really written a post like this before or asked for help from people i don’t know, so idk quite how to do this but i hope this comes across coherently 🫶

(all names changed for privacy & safety reasons)

my name is olivia, i’m a 21 year old and i’ve been diagnosed for two years (exhibited symptoms since i was a child). i met my best friend and current ex-partner, chris (M, 22), at the end of 2021. he has never known a life without comfort, love or safety, and our relationship together was the first “real” relationship he had (one that developed into a real, genuine connection). i was open about my diagnosis & other mental health conditions and honestly, for the majority of our relationship, there was absolutely not a single issue between us.

last year was a year that tested us both immensely as individuals and as a couple, and at the very end of the year he moved 3 hours away for family reasons (i will not be going into them on here). to say i was crushed was an understatement. throughout our entire relationship, chris has been the most amazingly supportive, loving, and kind person i have genuinely ever met. his patience is immeasurable and he is truly the absolute love of my life.

however. in november of last year, i had to move out of home due to my own personal family reasons (but i will say that it was due to one of my trauma-givers), and i have moved into an environment where i am able and encouraged to look after myself, and as such i am feeling all of the emotions i have suppressed through the last long while of yearly trauma. despite it only being two months since my initial move, it has been extremely nurturing for my growth and i have come leaps and bounds.

when chris confessed to me tonight that he was not able to provide me the support to keep up with my symptoms, i felt nothing but gratitude. no anger, resentment, or hurt. for the first time in a relationship, i was shown the kind, yet honest, truth as opposed to trying to convince me it’s my fault, or i’m a monster, or that i’m toxic. there was nothing but love and patience the entire time we spoke.

i guess i’m just really, really stuck. i am ready to grow, and give myself the love and care i have given to others all my life, but i can’t help but hope (or feel, if you’d be so kind as to validate my delulu /lh) that when i am ready, and when he is ready, our paths lead us to the same field.

he is still my best friend, and our connection is simply too strong to sever any friendship we both want, so i know that i’ll still have him in my life. but how do i find a way to move on without my boyfriend for now? i have never had a relationship end amicably, so that’s one issue but i have never met anyone like him. i can’t see myself moving on, not ever.",AdCute2301,,False,18yeux1,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18yeux1/coping_with_a_breakup_advice_appreciated/
Dealing with abandonment,1704370858.0,"Hi everyone. I was diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago and have been doing DBT up until last spring, as my progress felt sufficient to both my therapist and me (and I could no longer afford seeing her if ""just for comfort""). I'm 26. I'd say even though I'm definitely borderline, therapy helpf a great deal and I'm mostly functioning. I'm in a stable long-term relationship, I've got solid friendships and life projects I'm excited about. I still struggle with feelings of emptiness and dissociative/paranoid episodes but I manage pretty well actually. Like, I don't let it ruin my life like it used to. It's a lot of work but I'm happy I got there.

That being said, I'm at a loss to deal with recent events in my life. Both my sibling and a very close friend have chosen to remove me from their lives in the span of a week (although they made their decision separately, no link there). Neither of them has taken time or care to explain why. Neither of them let me have a conversation about it. They both just messaged me that they didn't want to see me or hear from me anymore. 

My other close friends and my partner all think I haven't done anything to warrant such drastic decisions. Nothing traumatic or shocking happened, and in the case of my friend, nothing in our friendship seemed to indicate that was coming. My friend even reassured me and had a laugh at my paranoid tendencies a couple days before cutting me off. I can only speculate about why it happened. I can't even ""work on myself"" and turn this into a lesson. My partner and friends think this is unfair and tough. I think so too, but I so desperately want there to be ""something to do"" about it that I'd rather it be justified, so that I could apologize or ""do better"". I don't particularly find it comforting to think I did nothing wrong. If anything, it makes me feel helpless.
How am I supposed to deal with this? I know rationally that there's nothing I can do–they don't want me to contact them, I don't want to make things worse by trying to make people take sides or even asking help from our parents regarding my sibling. We had separate Christmas dinners and it was really awful, on top of this I was supposed to have a friend's Christmas dinner to make it feel a bit better but the aforementioned close friend therefore un-invited me. My dad's birthday is coming up and I have no idea how it's going to play out. I feel rejected and abandoned and I can't even rationalize those feelings away because I am objectively rejected and abandoned.

I have no idea how to cope besides waiting it off. It's infuriating and paralyzing. I don't know what to do, it makes me want to regress to my former less functioning BPD self. I know I can't and I won't but I feel so disempowered by having to act ""rationally"" and ""sanely"". I just have to accept the situation I guess but I can't find anything online to help, as most results are about *feelings* or *fears* of abandonment, not the actual thing. If anyone has any clue or resource on this I would appreciate it greatly.

I've run my relationship to the ground,1704330585.0,"this post might be a bit all over the place so tyia to anyone that reads it. and I will preface by saying this is worded as a venting post, but i am open to advice/criticism because I want to accept accountability here and hopefully fix things but please, please be gentle with wording as I'm super sensitive and don't want to spiral more.

my 6 month relationship just ended a few weeks ago. he ended it. however at the same time he ended things, I was already spiralling and very mentally unstable and suicidal. so he has kept in contact with me and tried to support me as much as he can. he even was willing to give me another chance, but I have been so unstable that I haven't been able to do what I told him I would do- truly we should be waiting a bit until I'm more stable before he gives me another chance (and we both acknowledged this a few nights ago). I learned shortly before I met him that I had BPD, and I thought that I recognized all my symptoms- well I was wrong. our whole relationship he has told me that he was unsure if we would work. and I always thought he meant that he wasn't sure he wanted me. since the very first time he said it, it's never left my head and caused my bpd to spiral even more with the thoughts of not being loved and why am I with him if he doesn't want me? ever since then it's only gotten worse, with me picking out every single behavior he does as proof he doesn't want/respect/love me. the fact that his love language didn't match mine made me feel like he didn't love me, and I'd try to share it with him, but I was sharing it over every little behavior. we were having ""conversations"" or ""tiffs"" weekly. it has been exhausting for both of us. I'm constantly splitting. I love him so much for who he is, but every time he does something that I view as proof he doesn't like me, I split, and I see it as completely black. I feel no love for him because I feel like he doesn't have it for me. I get so upset at him. every single time, I think ""this isn't going to work, we can't be together because if this is how he treats me then how can we be together long term? why should I be with someone that doesn't want me?"". I genuinely thought he was the reason we weren't thriving and I wasn't feeling loved.

the past few weeks, ive been looking more into BPD and resonating with SO much of it. almost every single thing. it explains almost all of my behaviors. I didn't realize what I was doing was splitting, and seeing it as black and white. when he does the tiniest thing, I literally can't feel the whole of the relationship and I focus solely on that one thing. 5 minutes after we fight, I'm totally in love with him again and fine, and then I get upset because he doesn't bounce back the same. well duh, of course he's not going to. he's a normal person that was just yelled at for his normal human actions. he's confused and hurt and probably wondering why I love him one second and hate him the next? I'm wondering the same thing. I always thought we just weren't compatible. but I'm realizing more that I'm the reason we're not doing well. I'm so fucking sensitive. I read last night the quote about how people with BPD are like burn victims, and I was like holy shit that's what it feels like.

I pre-imagine what I think his reactions or actions will be, and when it's not that, I get upset. why am I not able to let him be a fucking human being? why do I need him to act exactly how I expect him to act? and why do I have expectations in the first place? 

I don't want to lose him. he is the first person I've ever truly loved, not someone I've been infatuated with as my FP. I don't feel like I need him to survive, which is another first, I WANT him. I love and value our time together. when I'm not making him feel like a terrible fucking human being, things go so well. I want to stop treating him like this, but it's not intentional. im not intentionally degrading him. it's a deeply rooted feeling that he doesn't love me, and I bring it to his attention when he does things that remind me of it. he's never treated me bad. there is only one specific instance where I can remember him treating me ""poorly"", but in reality he was just so fucking done and defeated and didn't know what to say or do and just wanted to go to sleep. but from that specific night, my mental health and our relationship has just completely declined. he tried to break up with me the next day. we've had so many instances of almost breaking up. I was thinking it was because he didn't want me. but in reality it was because he couldn't handle me always pulling out the worst in him and ragging on him.

is there any hope of saving this? after everything we've been through, he's literally still here. he has stayed this whole time. even after we broke up, were still hanging out and texting every day. he clearly has love for me. he clearly cares. but why can't I see it? why can I only focus on the things he does ""wrong""? last week he brought me flowers and an activity book for us to do together, and then this weekend I got upset with him twice over literally nothing but in the moment it felt like everything. when it happens, the feelings are so intense and I there's nothing I can do to pull myself out of it. 


and on the flip side, I'm the most understanding and caring person to him. he has a lot of his own issues he's deal with himself, and I've supported him through all of it. I tell him frequently how much I care for him and I try to help with his grief and his mental health and try to tell him to give himself grace. how can I say that in one breath and then in the next be mad at him every other day for literally nothing? his mental health has deteriorated from this as well just from me flip flopping on him so frequently and calling him out on everything. 


how do I fix my thought process? any sane person would've blocked me a long time ago. he said last night that he sees I'm trying based on how much research I'm doing and me apologizing and taking the accountability, and I'm looking into therapists that specialize in PTSD or BPD, and other treatments. but I don't want to lose him. even though he deserves to not be in this rollercoaster anymore. he deserves to be loved, and I want to be the one to love him. he's willing to give me a chance, and I so badly don't want to fuck it up again. it's hard to say officially because of everything weve been through, but part of me feels like he could be the one. I have never been able to picture a future with someone before. I've never wanted kids with someone before. I've never wanted a life with someone. until I met him. about 3/4 months into dating, I felt like this might be it. I want him.

Need funds to complete my education.,1704324596.0,"Hello to one and all here who goes through this post. I honestly have no idea where else to post this. The thing is i joined my med school in 2014 forced by my parents despite their poor financial conditions. And to this date, I havent finished my med school yet part of the reason is the constant financial issues from my parents side for which even now there is no clear cut solution and add to that my mental health issues are getting worse and worse thanks to the fact the I am unable to move on in my life, it's like for the past 10 years time has just stopped for me, my batch mates, they cleared their med school now they even on the verge on finishing with their specialization. 
Through this post I want to ask you guys for help because my life is completely f ucke d up. I am 29 and soon I will be 30 and I honestly don't want to continue like this. For all these years I hoped that my parents will figure shit financially because the mer school I was enrolled has a hefty amount money as fees. 
As of now I am planning move out of my college hostel, because sooner or later they will themselves throw me out due to non-payment of hostel fees which was supposed to be paid in July 2023. And my certificates are with college for which I need about $4100 or £ 4400. Getting the certificates is not my current issue. 
The thing with which I need help the most is to get out my college hostel and find an accommodation outside. I ahve already enrolled in a diploma course for content marketing which costs a total of $64 or £59, out of which I managed to pay $136 or £124. But I still need to pay for the remaining 5 months which is about $99 or £91 . And the due date for 2nd Installment is 6th January 2024.

So in short if I sum the following are my current financial requirements: 

Rent + brokerage+ deposit: $1955 or £1781
need a laptop to find freelance work: $481 or £440
Fee for diploma course: $99 or £91
My bsc anthropology 1st year fee: $74.5 or £68.2
Application fee: $3.6 or £3.3
Backup for utility expense till I mangage to stand on my feet: $289 or £274
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total: $2902.1 or £2657.5

Since this a BPD support group, I am not sure if I am allowed to post it here. But if there is any problem with me posting it here, I will be more than welcome to take it down.

I have attacehed with this post a copy of how much hostel fee I need to pay, the coat of accommodation for the place I chose, my diploma course which is due on 6th January, the application form fee IGNOU, as well the three year feea for my Bsc Online distance learning course. The amounts mentioned in all the copies are in INR,,so in my post above a gave a rough estimate as to how much it will coat me in USD or Euro. 


Here is my PayPal link, if anyone who goes through this post and wishes to help because it matters a lot to me. It's like my only or maybe last chance of making my life worth living after continuously struggling with suicidal ideations, self harm amd with no one to even support not even my parents. The only help I had to survive all these is only my therapist ans she has also moved far away from where I live, so one constant support through the years is also gone and now it's all upto me to give myself a decent life or maybe give up on this life like I have done for the few years.

There’s no such thing as being behind in life or being behind in society…the only things along those lines that are real are social constructs, societal bias and comformity, generational trauma, closed-mindedness, desperation for validation from other people, the illusion of superiority in the form of unnecessary, unwanted, and unasked for judgement, the fear the government specifically designs to control the people to get more money and power, peer pressure, and unhealthy perfectionism. Don’t be a sheep, allow yourself to be a unique, beautifully imperfect human…life has no set schedule or manual, so stop comparing yourself to others. Don’t be afraid to be different or go against the societal/social norm. Learn to be okay with being controversial, and unlearn society’s unrealistic standards. You’re uniquely you. It’s not your job to keep everyone else happy. However it is your job to keep your peace and to do what’s best for your life, your plans, and your mental health…even if it upsets people. You’re worth it. Stop caring about what other people think of you and other people’s opinions…they’re just that, opinions. It’s time to stop fearing other people, they’re only human, just like you, with their own flaws and challenges and personal hells to go through. If something doesn’t affect you, just shut up about it and don’t butt into other people’s business. It’s not your life, it’s theirs, and you’re not them. And to incorrectly assume you know exactly what someone might be going through or what it’ll take to cut them into one of society’s boring, sheep, conformist cookies, is just so wrong and sad and pathetic on so many levels. Again, you’re not them, you’re not in their mind, you’re not in their situation, so shut up about things you know nothing about, doesn’t matter if they’re friends or family. It’ll just make things worse if you judge and assume. And things you say literally have the ability to stick with people and rewire their brains and change their brain chemistry, so don’t be the reason people start thinking that they’re not enough or even the reason they start considering unaliving themself. Be the opposite. Perfection doesn’t and will never exist, no matter what society says. Fuck society and their unrealistic, engineered standards. Don’t add to society’s toxicity, half of them don’t deserve the time of day. Your imperfections are beautiful. Additonally, always try to spread love, positivity, understanding, unconditional support, and empathy wherever and whenever you can, you never know what someone else might be going through and you could even be the person to restore their faith in humanity 💖

I’m proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself too, even for the baby steps. Some progress is better than no progress at all, ignore the haters and don’t let them put you back to square one…and don’t let them make you even think that you’re back at square one when they’re not you and don’t have your mind or your experiences, it’s not their life, and they have no right to judge your progress, especially when I know half of your progress most people are too blind to see…I see your progress, and you’re doing absolutely amazing 😊

The sup stack that saved my ship! Read if you have hope(:,1704053956.0,"Update:sadly after day 27, something stopped working. I can only guess it's the nac. She still takes everything, but that overwhelming level of anxiety/pit has come back to her and she just now had another self isolating eps. Tbh I don't know if we'll recover from this or not. Idk if it'll stop working for every person but To all who I gave hope, I'm sorry 😞. I thot I found a solution to at least enjoy my time together with her but it seems it was likely short lived. If we get out of this postively somehow long term, I'll update.

This exact stack: bought from vitamin shoppe.

Solgar omega 3 950mg

Vitaminshoppe brand L theanine 100mg

Vitaminshoppe Nac 600mg

has pretty much saved my relationship and now I'm happily married.

For us, it has made her no longer explosive/randomly angry or self isolating anymore. It's legit 99% a normal relationship now . There's only been some small things were we communicated within under an hour each time like a normal understanding convo with one another. Sometimes even in 5 mins we good after small thing. That B4 trying this supplement stack, normaly wouldve made her give up on us and self isolate for days and or she'd get mad about it, if i was able to get her to try to tell me wat she was feeling. We are super happy to say we haven't had a meltdown in 27 days! B4 it was literally everry 2-3 days. We are still meltdown free since Dec 19 (x and we are both super happy to be with each other ❤️💗. !!! ((: She's felt so much happier, she's told me and I've noticed it. it's been easier to talk to one another too. We've committed to a future together and are starting a semi life in the same home soon cx. This stack is a ship saver!! It really balanced out her intense feels to practically nothing!. She does still have small sad type moments here and there from things that remind her of childhood trauma alittle or things that she gets mad at herself internally abit for forgetting. But when they do happen and I notice she's looking down a little, I ask her about it in a supportive way, and she opens up and within about 10 mins and we are past it and up again. That's it(:. it's very occasional too. Like once a week. Very manageable, easy to recover, communicating is easier and is much more possible now.

This is wat she takes and when:

1pm everyday, she takes the stack, 2 of each listed.

10pm she takes her lamotrigine and 1 vitaminne shop brand magnesium glycinate 400mg tablet form

No idea if she still needs her lamo subscription med but didn't want to chance us melting down again. So still on it. Might maybe try it without later in the future, now that the stack and magnesium seems to help alot. For now tho we are super happy together (:. Anyone else that sees this, it takes the edge off very noticably! Try it. 😁. Do you and or your special person a huge favor and start the stack ASAP, you won't regret it. Worth every penny.

Also she's not in DBT. We do our best for each other and love care n support one another. We are incredibly happy with this stack and mag. CX 💞 hoping this will help others who have SOs that want to give up in a loop and or themselves and struggling to find help. Not a cure, but really dam close!

I chose to be I choose to be codependent.,1703997537.0,"

Ok this is going to be a long story on why I made this choice and how me and my husband of 2 and a half years are making it work. 
I'm multiple diagnosed with ASD, BPD, Bipolar type 1, Schizoaffective Bipolar type, OCD, ODD, ADHD, CPTSD and a lot of other mental health issues as well as some medical ones but those are the main reasons.

Before I met my husband I was extremely unstable constant splitting, at one point I od'd on my blood pressure meds, I have a nasty scar on my thigh from a bad relationship[self inflicted] I was an absolute mess. Let's add onto this I had recently had a therapist that was constantly instilling into my head that I was a burden by saying what are you going to do when your parents die. My parents had also been known to bring me to look at group homes without telling me before hand the first time this happened I had a full meltdown in front of the woman who ran it and she said if I did that in front of the other girls they would beat me up.

After the relationship that resulted in both the scar and the od I finally decided enough was enough and took matters into my own hands because I knew where my life was headed. It was on a dead end path to a group home. So I started looking for someone. Now here's how I found someone that changed my life completely. I chose the bdsm subreddits. I already knew I was a little with a codependent personality so I actively looked for a daddy-dom. Someone who knew how to take a caretaker role and help when I got out of control and acted like a child. That's how I found my husband.  He knew from day one about my illnesses, and also knew quite a bit about psychology so he has been extremely understanding from day one and we hit it right off. Within 2 weeks of connecting online I moved in with him we married 6 months later. Since meeting him I have gone into remission I'm also semi-indepentant in small.. or well for me big ways... for the first time in my life I can truly be left alone in the house for long periods of time. I haven't had a split in 3 years and most of my insecurities have faded and when they do show their ugly little demon heads he immediately squashes them and builds me back up. I've also been able to go off almost all my medications and im now on only one. And weve also been talking about having children of our own. For me personally, it's the best decision I ever could have made.

EDIT: Just be careful. A lot of people online are looking for an abuse victim and know nothing about aftercare. At first we were all about the sex but we quickly moved on and grew as a couple. It became about the future and how we didn't know what we wanted to do but we knew we wanted to do it together. He keeps me sane and I keep him happy. Even now he is telling me to be careful what I say to you all. He is and subsequently our relationship is  unique. I asked him what he would say to you about looking for someone online and he said, ""Don't tell them what you want outside of general things. Tell them you want rough sex but don't tell them you want aftercare. Let them tell you that they want to care for you after. Let them say thing about themselves without knowing that you like it. Then if what they say without knowing matches what you want, be safe and go for it. If you say you like getting ice cream after a doctor visit then they say I always get ice cream after the doctors, he is probably lying.",Diligent-Sense-5689,,False,18uzhr1,3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18uzhr1/i_chose_to_be_i_choose_to_be_codependent/
"I need help to understand, please help.",1703987661.0,"Okay, so this is going to be a long one. And I will throw in a TL;DR for those of you who want the spark notes, the full details are below. 

TL;DR: I (23M) have BDP, my partner (24F) and I have had a very hard year. Tomorrow is our anniversary. My BPD diagnosis is very recent, and it makes a lot of sense as to why I am the way I am. I hate that I have the tendencies to lie and distrust in the relationship and keep myself so guarded and try to grab control so badly when I feel I have none. I need help to understand where I’m going wrong and suggestions if possible on what I can do to better myself and to recognize when I’m splitting to stop dropping the ball in this relationship. I love this woman to death and I hate the way I am but it feels like I can’t help it. 

Okay, for those of you who want more of the picture, here you go, buckle up, because this is going to be very lengthy. 

I (23M) met my girlfriend (24F) last year in October on bumble. I haven’t had any relationship that has lasted or ended on good terms with the exception of a couple years ago (2019-2020) I was set to be married to a woman, joined the military, but shortly after boot camp and all that, she told me I changed too much and called it off. (Pretty much the longest standing relationship I had that was positive for me that was not abusive or a trauma bond, but I’ll spare your time and annoyance) I digress. We ended up chatting each other up, bonding and playing video games together and got into a relationship on New Year’s Day. Things for the first few months were stellar, but I kept secrets and lied to her about things in regards to myself because I hated who I really was ( I know it’s shitty and I hate myself for it). As time went on, I found that I only ever wanted to talk to her, be around her and do things with her because she helped me feel happier than I was. She noticed things were off and just not right. Caught me in my lies and called me out for it (rightfully so.) instead of owning up to any of them, I doubled down on them and I got defensive. I felt as though I was being attacked and threatened. The problem is this caused a lot bigger of fights and I felt like I did when I was a kid, and the way my dad yelled at me to get me to listen, I found myself doing the same to her and making her cry. I hated myself for it, but I just felt like I wasn’t getting heard at all. Like I was actively being ignored or blown off. Her attitudes about everything (justifiably) felt off, she seemed to be acting different toward me ( yes I know it was probably my anxiety and other issues picking up on things that weren’t there.) and she began talking to people I wasn’t comfortable with. And her response to the situation was “well, you need to deal with it. You need to trust me and it’s clear you don’t.” The problem is I do trust her, but I don’t trust the people she started talking to. I know she is okay and not going to do anything but I can’t seem to put the feeling off that someone will dupe her or steal her away or do some shifty things that will devastate me. This has caused a lot of issues between us because I can’t shake the feeling and she’s getting upset because she feels suffocated by me. (This has since changed because her stance is “I don’t really care anymore. If you can’t figure it out then you need to find someone who will put up with you doing this because I can easily find someone who won’t.”) so i have pretty much decided to just keep it to myself. Which truthfully messes with my head but it gives her the piece of mind so i will take that loss and try to turn it into a win somehow. 

Over time, i began therapy and she began telling me, “hey, I want you to answer yes or no to a couple things. Don’t explain, just yes or no.” And essentially asked me the questions that fall onto the MSI-BPD, and I answered 9/10 yes. She said to ask my therapist about her opinion on BPD, and when I did, she ended up telling me “actually, that’s something I have been wanting to bring up, I was looking at the notes from our previous appointments, and i would say you have anxiety issues, depression, BPD, and PTSD.” And this led into a whole rabbit hole.  I’ve kinda gotten to the point of noticing sometimes when I’m going to start having issues that are very abnormal and I chalk up to BPD and being over dramatic. Personally, I took the diagnosis really hard. Because growing up, I was a massive Star Wars nerd ( I still am) and always idolized Obi-Wan. I felt terrible watching Anakin go through what he did and the more I watched it growing up, the more I realized, I felt bad for Anakin (it’s assumed he has BPD, if you haven’t looked into it, please do, it’s actually very interesting to watch his journey through that lens.) I related to just wanting to be in control of my life and not have an obligation to what is supposed to be. I hated watching those around me that I love suffer and most of those times, I am the one to cause it. And getting the diagnosis to me, to me it meant I can never be like Obi-wan, always at peace with the lack of control. But it meant that I’ll always be like Anakin. And it broke me. I hate that I’m like this and have absolutely 0 control and that I feel destined to lose and fail at everything I do. 

Please, please give me advice, anything helps. I need help so I don’t lose this woman, she means the world to me and I hate that I keep failing her this much.",MHRB010123,,False,18uw9p9,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18uw9p9/i_need_help_to_understand_please_help/

I recently started with a new therapist with a mental health treatment system. My responses during our intake session tagged me as a potential candidate for TMS.

I haven't seen much about TMS for BPD and was hoping to hear from folks who have BPD and tried TMS.

People are so awful and mean,1703867082.0,"Yesterday I was at r/BPD and I saw a post about a teenage girl around 16 telling how she had a major self harming problem for 3 years and to fill the void of neglect she had started to go as far as cutting herself in front of her mother to feel seen. 

When that happened, the girl’s parent just cursed her out, took a blanket and covered herself to go to sleep while her daughter was cutting her own leg a few feet away. Apparently previously her mom had displayed no sympathy towards her for even needing stitches for self harm or care towards any of her self harm.  

Now this girl was asking “what should she do” in terms of making her mother care for her. Nearly the top comments were all filled with people bashing her for being “manipulative and an abusive teenager” and that her mother is probably sick of her guilt tripping antics that’s why she didn’t care whether she cuts herself or not. Saying that she was entitled etc. “It’s your fault for bringing this misery upon yourself.”

I felt so heartbroken because a child going as far as cutting in front of parent isn’t a “manipulative cunning technique.” This isn’t a situation where your abusive narcissistic ex cuts themselves in front of you to make you to stay.

I cancelled new years eve plans and I'm spending it alone while my gf is still going away,1703850538.0,"I always hated new years eve, I always spent it alone because I had no friends or on the few occasions I did I cancelled last minute, idk why. I have been with my gf for 2 years and I have spent the last 2 new years eve with her and her friends, and we were supposed to be spending this one as well toghether. 
As soon as New Year's eve was mentioned, I told her that I was really hoping to not go away and celebrate it in our city, but her friends (which I spent also a lot of one on one time with) said that they were thinking about going to the lake house, which is quite far away to get to by train. I mumbled and truly didn't want to go and I asked my gf if we could even hint at staying in genoa, She said it was already all decided and so I didn't even get to express the fact that it was going to be difficult for me be there. So I just followed along the plans, which ultimately became too much for the same exact reason that I told her in the beginning: I have wayyy too many exams and I am stressed because it implies going away for many days rather than spending just one night. So I told her I couldn't go anymore and we initially left it all there, she truly apologised and asked if she could try to talk her friends into doing it here, but ultimalty I said it was already too late, she should have thought of that way earlier, as we had been talking about new years eve for more than a month. I wasn't too angry at first, I was much rather disappointed that she still wanted to go even though I do understand that it is probably her last New years eve with her friends since they are all graduating med school and going different pathways, still I felt like the main priority for her was to spend it with her friends rather than me when presented with the need to spend it with one or the other. This really upset me as I feel like I have been hurt twice - first of all by her not saying anything to her friends when I mentioned it would have been a problem for me still I passively agreed because as soon as I feel someone shutting me down, I am not going to ask again ( I truly don't think she did it maliciously she never asks her friends for anything even if she needs something and I do believe she didn't want to cause any problems), and by her going even though I have decided I can't anymore and I blame it on her since she didn't say anything, that might not have changed the original plan, but could have least let me be honest about my struggle rather than swiping it down the rug. We have been fighting a lot, I am so mad, I am trying not to insult her anymore since the last year it was a fucking mess as she was studying abroad, and this discussion reminded her so much of all the discussions we had while she was away( she wanted do to something i made her feel guilty for not making me enough of a priority and it ended up being a nightmare for her, since she cut off contact with all her friends to try and salvage our relationship, and even though i regret it so much, this doesnt seem to help me change or act better, the only thing that's changed is that i dont verbally abuse her anymore calling all sort of disgusting names.
I don't know what to do or how to cope these days. I feel as I always do this thing where when we have a sort of big plan which involves going on holiday/moving from our city, I tend to not want to go, as a sort of provocation? To test her to see if she would chouse me? Obviously she always fails because people cannot be tested on these things, still my rational brain and emotional brain seem to be 2 separate entities and there is no mediation that lasts long enough for us to stay peaceful. She is now saying she isn't gonna go if we don't find a way to even discuss this in person because she won't go if going away means starting the new year angry and resentful. I think I try to emotionally manipulate her, and I don't know how to change this or how to even come to terms with the fact that I do this that makes my love feel not authentic, wondering even if, and borderlines in general have the capacity to love another person without wanting to bring that person down to your sadness whenever something happens that doesn't go my way. It makes me feel rotten to core, and yet again, I seem to all relate it to myself.

I learned this the hard way and set clear boundaries since then. It is very hard for me with my  mental health diagnosis . 

Yesterday we had a phone session and my therapist had plans to go away for the holiday's. Last night i was writing my notes/list for my future therapy apts.

I had no intention of feeling this way and i had no idea i even sent that email to her. I woke up to emails, text and missed calls from my therapist.  I called her immediately as i woke up and  i said im okay and I kept apologizing.  She was going away on her trip today so she hung up quickly after i said i was okay and it was not meant for her. I feel so bad and i know that my therapist will probably have a huge talk with me when we meet in the new year.

will have my phone available for true emergencies only so that I can have my own self-care to be a great therapist for my clients when I return. ""

The second being chemicals, LSD, THC, MDMA, psilocybin, ketamine, and DMT. These are the chemicals that have helped me the most in a therapeutic setting. I do not rely on any chemicals, I merely use these said chemicals listed above as of means to understand my subconscious more so that I bring my subconscious to the conscious understanding and therefore come to terms with it. In regards of doing so, I have managed to follow

The third step being that I was honest with myself. I was being truthful to my reality and making sure that my spirit was aligned with my reality. If I was not in the flow state, then I was in pain.

The fourth being exercise, endorphin production ability.

The fifth being diet, eating the right things that benefit me in my fullest capacity. So far, a keto to low carb vegan diet has benefitted me the most. Although eating the occasional junk food from time to time is allowed as well in dire situations.

"A remarkable experience I had on LSD when dealing with Borderline Personality Disorder, the most psychologically painful mental disorder known to humans.",1703053053.0,"that I was able to for the first time access a side of me, a part of me that has been trapped away for a long time. I subconsciously blocked the pain from my conscious awareness, and in doing that I was consciously blocking the subconscious. And in that process I was self-medicating with external things that have given me relief from the subconscious when my conscious was not so conscious of it in that frame of life. I was for a very long time stuck in a cell of metaphorical instances. Multiple cells. And in each cell was trapped parts of me, parts of my subconscious, that have prevented me from being the ultimate version of myself. And in doing that, blocking off my subconscious, I have in a way locked up bits and parts of me that have been trapped in the cell all along. And in doing that, I have made a prison out of my own mind. And that prisons name was called Borderline Personality.

Participating in the prison I was given full access of the cells, and with that being said, I was given access to parts of me that have been locked up for so long. And in locking myself up, I have prevented my being, my spirit, my soul, from being true to the principal of reality. My reality exists because I made it exist. The knowledge in my brain is what allows me to speak my frequency. The frequency is love. This frequency has allowed the cells to be unlocked, open, and to then be free from my pain.

If you take a moment to appreciate religion for once you would realize that the main principle of it is to show a frequency of something. Depending on what you believe in, you would realize that everything you know about the said religion is to make you believe in a higher power, whatever that is to your perception of higher power. Whether it being metaphysical or not, you are essentially putting yourself up to a frequency, a state of consciousness that just flows from you. Allowing your spirit to flow through the energetic vibrations which is known as the \*flow\* state, as discovered by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a psychologist.

My pain has its consequences. Just as much as yours does too. If I do not acknowledge the pain ever in my life then I will resort to drugs, I will resort to violence, I will resort to things that are past my spirit, bypassing the structural components of my reality and living a life that goes against my spirit, all because I was avoiding the pain, in my case, it was not being my true self. My true self is what mattered the most, and in the process of living reality I had become conscious of blocking the subconscious. And in doing so, I wasn't loving myself. What is there not to love? I am just like everyone else, human.

I do not know who you are, maybe you are a great human, the best that you can be, or maybe you are someone who is not great, not doing the best they can be, and instead, you are distracted from your own pain that you cannot face at this very present moment, and that is totally fine, because right now you are too focused on other things, and for good reason. But just know that you are love too.

"Triggered, Black Mood",1702750865.0,"I need to vent. I've been working so hard to feel better. It feels like maybe I'm getting worse.

At a  visit with my kids, the ex was an asshole. He's having me take them Xmas Eve, which I should be happy about, but he was rude in front of the kids about it, saying he wanted to be left alone that night. In the past, we had me stay on their couch that night, which worked for me because it showed the kids we're still family and it saved me from hosting in a cramped one bedroom apartment.

They are 22 and 16, plus there's my elsest's girlfriend who has been staying with them for a few months. I have no idea how I will entertain them. I want this to be a fun and cheerful experience but my mood is triggered and dark.

All I can think about is all the inconvenience and discomfort of hosting. The couches are not comfortable. The kitchen is tiny, I only have seating for two. The TV is in the bedroom, I guess I could move it to the living room for now. It's just one night but I am full of fear and avoidance. How can I reframe this to actually look forward to it.

Triggered by being minimized,1702677852.0,"I just realized today that my biggest trigger is being minimized/invalidated. When somebody pushes these buttons I get incredibly angry and I sometimes can’t control myself. This can lead to me latching on to a problem/situation with a person and not be able to let go. 

I realized this because I was having to interact with someone at work who kept saying things to me that made me feel minimized. It also felt like he was not acknowledging his mistakes or the work I had done to fix said mistakes. I blew up at him because I felt like he was not listening to me and minimizing what I was saying. For example, I was upset that he was contacting me/expecting me to fix his mistakes on my days off so I told him that that was inappropriate to do. His reaction was “I understand that you don’t like being contacted on your days off” this felt minimizing to me because it made it seem like I was the one asking for special treatment when in reality he was expecting me to do work without compensation. In my mind it doesn’t matter what I think, my coworker having that expectation is inappropriate full stop. 

I got in a little bit of trouble with one of our bosses for doing that and had to have a sit down conversation where I was told that I should have handled it better and used a nicer tone of voice. I tried using a nicer tone of voice and tried to talked to about five other people before I blew up at this guy and nobody was listening or fixing the problems. The manager did reassure me that my anger was reasonable and the complaints I brought forth were fair. 

It’s just embarrassing to be told that your’e too much by people who push you bit and bit past your anger point. I don’t like exploding but I don’t know how else to be heard. 

I guess my questions are:
- Now that I know being minimized/not listened to/invaladated is a trigger, how do I go about managing it while also not being a complete push over? 

- How do I let things go? I feel like a dog in attack mode who is latched onto a bite and can’t unhook my jaw but everyone is just treating this like it’s an easy simple choice.  

- Has anyone else struggled with this? I know that my family spent a lot of time invalidating me and they still continue to do it so I think I might get triggered worse in the future.",310a101,,False,18jbkt0,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/18jbkt0/triggered_by_being_minimized/

Cutting people off after healing,1702519424.0,"Last year my partner and I broke up for many, many reasons, most of which stemmed from my untreated (at the time) BPD and his avoidant behavior and overall hyper independent nature. A classic combo. Our breakup broke me in many ways, but 2023 ended up being the best year of my life because I started going therapy every week, taking medication, learning how to be alone, and forming positive relationships in my life. I still struggle deeply with my BPD, but I've gotten better at identifying my emotions as they arise. This does not mean I have completely changed my behaviors or emotions themselves.

About a month ago, my ex and I reconnected. For some reasons, a relationship isn't feasible for us however the love and friendship is still there. He is still a solitary person and has his own mental health struggles that he hasn't really addressed. He hinted at us being in an ""open relationship,"" since when we are together now, we are loving and affectionate and to him I am the first person he wants to see. But because of our time constraints we both know that we can't fully devote ourselves to each other.

Very quickly into our reconnection, I've noticed that many of my old thought patterns, triggers, and behaviors have arisen. It honestly scares me; I've been really good this year when dating other people to mitigate toxic patterns and I've overall worked really hard to be different. At this point I don't know if it's just him who causes me this pain (because of our history, our love, and his avoidant tendencies) or if I am simply not healed. It is probably both. But he wants us to remain in each other's lives and honestly I do too. But there is a chasm of distance between us and it breaks me. And feeling shitty all the time has taken such a toll on me, because after our falling out last year I vowed to never feel this way again.

I feel sad at the idea of cutting him out completely but I honestly don't know how to feel okay with him in my life or if it is even worth it. I feel so conflicted and I wish I didn't feel anything.

"Not sure if it's just how I love, or if this is a bad relationship",1702179333.0,"I just need a place to talk.

I (22F) feel things so deeply, and although my partner (of >4 years) is very sweet and supportive when I have mood swings or meltdowns in front of him, I can never tell him (30M) about the private hell I go through when we are apart. I am in a much better place now than I was 3 years ago. But recently living sober from weed has forced me to be with my huge emotions again. It's very difficult to write this, knowing I will not numb myself with THC afterwards.

I get incredibly insecure when he doesn't respond to my texts. I am incredibly hurt when he leaves me hanging even for a little bit. For example, even when he told me he was too busy to hang out, I wrote long long texts at 3 AM pleading to spend an evening with him. And although I felt it was very sincere and genuine emotions I was portraying, I felt hideously embarrassed and deleted before he woke up. But now again, he is late on the video call he promised over the weekend. I have already cried multiple times today about this. In some ways, I wish I hadn't deleted the texts, so he could see how viciously I am feeling about this, maybe he would be more understanding of it all. But also it just isn't fair for me to beg and plead while he is asleep when I think I know how he will respond when he wakes up. 

The worst part of this is, the moments of heightened insecure attachment leave me feeling so rejected and so desperate, often in the hours or moments leading up to us hanging out. But when I see him, he is expecting to see a happy bubbly version of me, and I instinctively snap into a frantic idealization instead, and happily forget the hours or sometimes days of agony leading up to it.

It is made much worse by some notable trauma he inflicted on me earlier in our relationship. We have had positive and healing conversations about it, but I cannot help but be aware that I am in a trauma bond at this point. I don't think he 'leaves me hanging' any more than a normal relationship, I don't think he does it to hurt me. But there are other highly questionable dynamics in our relationship where I do feel he plays on my emotions to elicit a certain response from me. On the other hand, maybe this is just what love will always be like for me with Bpd. 

I'm already embarrassed to have typed this. I don't know if these huge feelings are because it's a part of my sober BPD brain, or if I am just very deep in a toxic relationship with someone I have feelings for.

Early stages of No Contact with parent...please help,1702106314.0,"Hi friends 😊

I have recently decided to go no contact with my mother. 

Slight context: she threatened to evict me from her house (partner and I were renting, she lived elsewhere) 3 weeks after a major abdominal surgery, because I didn't help her weed the garden. We have since moved to a new rental, and haven't heard from her since.

How do you navigate going no contact with a parent, when you still want to stay in touch with other family? 

My mother lives with my younger sister and grandmother. My sister is 16 and we have a great relationship, we talk everyday. My grandmother doesn't drive, doesn't own a cellphone, and relies on my mother for everything. 

My grandmother is extremely upset because I am not going to her birthday this year (due to mother being there too). Grandmother is terrified of death, and really loves big family events as she thinks each one is her last (😭😭). I offered to take her out to lunch, but as she is Coeliac, she gets really anxious eating at restaurants/cafes. 

She recently asked if I was coming to Christmas at mother's/grandmother's house, but I didnt even know about it, so I said I wasn't. This is where grandma started crying, and I felt like an absolute pile of shit for upsetting her.

Projection victims,1702060440.0,"Anyone else been a victim of others' projections because they have been traumatized by someone with BPD and so they only see you through the lens of the disorder instead of truly seeing you as a human being first? I feel like when people know you have the disorder their projections are inescapable. It's like all of a sudden you have no empathy but it's okay when others don't have empathy for you. They constantly assume your behavior is rooted in harm when sometimes you just need to feel your emotions and it's not personal. Or you are going through a lot and need space and time. Or your boundaries have been crossed too hard, you need to assert yourself, you are traumatized, you are struggling mentally, and you need to remove yourself from the situation.

My mother had a savior complex and constantly believed that I was the one who needed saving, that I was the crazy one, that I really needed her love, care, and protection. She made me believe that no one would ever see me the way that she saw me, that no one would ever understand me in the same way, that no one would ever make me feel safe or loved the way she did. She wanted to be the only one to make me happy. That it was okay when she didn't respect my boundaries or my needs (physically and emotionally), violated my privacy, got angry and yelled at me, but I would listen when she would tell me no. She was constantly paranoid that I was lying to her or displaying a facade or mask. She would infantilize me, idealize me when I'm happy, and devalue me when I'm not. A lot of insults and hurtful words would be thrown at me. She enjoyed having and asserting power and control over me and was very possessive and distrustful. Turning loved ones against me. Silencing me, inspiring fear and shame in me. Sometimes we are just human beings and we are reacting to the stress, trauma, projections, and confusion that we are being put through.

I'm really sorry that I didn't end things how you wanted, but I made a hard and fast rule and you intentionally broke it. I made it clear that that would make me feel unsafe. I listened to your boundary when you made it explicit, even after I was going insane convincing myself that everything was in my head. I still loved you, but I couldn't continue. I was also betrayed. I was also stonewalled. I was also smeared. I was also stalked. I was also criticized. I was also gaslighted. I was also projected onto. I was also traumatized. I was also love bombed.

BPD and ADHD,1701692144.0,"Hey!

I have ADHD and BPD, and ive been in treatment for a year (schema group and individual therapy). Its been real hard and slow work, but it has been very beneficial. 

However since ive been put on the appropriate ADHD meds (dexamphetamine) that actually work for me and dont make me feel horrible, ive been making progress wayyy faster than before. I can think clearer, i dont dissasociate as badly so i can actually work through emotions better. Im more present in the group, and its easier to connect.

Overall its a whole new world for me. I had never experienced actually being calm in my head, without also feeling numb (used to be on ritalin, which had very negative side effects in my case). And it feels like i can finally profit from all the hard work id been doing in therapy.

I found myself having zero desire to date or have sex after my previous ex and the same exact thing with my recent ex. Am I just an anomaly or something or do others relate? It's like I'm so distraught over the breakup that all I can find myself doing is trying to hangout with friends to move on and that feels good enough for me.

Hurt my best friend need advice,1701158024.0,"TLDR: pwBPD Hurt my best friend need advice on how to make things right from a person without BPD

Maybe this is unwelcome since I have BPD but I’m so profoundly aware of it and my symptoms, I’m in Therapy, I take medication, I’m trying with all my might to be normal and it’s working for the most part. I’m in a happy relationship, I’ve had my outbursts (never mean or aggressive, they look more like seeking reassurance and sobbing out of nowhere), but I have strategies to temper them 


HOWEVER. 
My best friend of 11 years and I had a falling out last weekend and idk what to do. I was at her engagement party when my boyfriend called me. He found texts in my iPad (ironically, with her) of me complaining in the past about things he did that hurt me (when he would ignore me or little things like that, things I didn’t want to bother him with. I know better now). He found texts of me saying I think a guy friend of ours is hot, even though my bf is the love of my life. He found texts of me ruminating to my best friend about my bf’s ex and how I went through his iPad back in April and deleted all pics of her in a fit of sadness. Anyway, the call was very intense and I thought he was breaking up with me so I left her party to talk things through with him. After an hour, I felt bad for leaving and came back. I told her what happened and gave her a hug and tried to dance (we were at the club). But I was constantly about to cry so I didn’t wanna cause a scene and left. The next few days were shit, convincing my bf to not take a break over what he saw, fixing things with him. I gave her space and she was so kind, saying she loves me and hopes I’m ok, I told her the same. Then after I resolve things with my boyfriend, she texts me saying she’s so hurt, she’d never do this to me, etc etc. I text her back a little angry and impulsively, saying it’s not like I asked for this to happen. I then calmed down and said bottom line - I’m sorry for even answering his call  at your party. The next week i was in jersey for Thanksgiving with my boyfriend and his family. I told her I’d see her when I’m back and call when she had time. I suppose I should’ve just called myself but truthfully she can be very pointed and I’m extremely sensitive and HATE confrontation, and hoped my texts were enough. It’s now over a week later, I haven’t found the space to call her and apologize. I also posted on IG an hour ago of a November photo dump and didn’t include pics from her party. I deleted the post because I felt bad but that’s not before I notice she commented saying “glad I made the cut” in a petty way. 

I sent a text apologizing to her saying I’m tired and I didn’t mean to exclude her. She told me she expected an apology phone call from me a long time ago and she’s shocked and sad and hurt and she thinks I don’t care about her. I’m exhausted and it scares me that I have thoughts of so coldly just throwing her away because the effort involved in confronting and apologizing to her (not even sure how at this point) is so draining and I’d rather just not deal with it. It also scares me that a reaction I have to potentially losing her is what my boyfriend would think and my family and other few friends. I will discuss these toxic thoughts in therapy.  But if I ever want to get better I have to face my fear of her and of confrontation and just call and apologize. I feel like a horrible person and tbh I probably am. I’m posting here because as someone who doesn’t have BPD but deals with someone who does, if you were in this situation and hurt like she is, what kind of apology would make things right ?

I caused the worst fight of our relationship and I don’t know why or what to do now.,1701129127.0,"I had a horrible meltdown/BPD episode last night and I treated my also-BPD partner of 3+ years who I live with so horribly for no good reason right as we were trying to go to bed. I pushed him so far past his breaking point that he broke down horribly too and I ruined what had earlier been a really great night out with friends. 

I hate feeling so out of control of myself and especially hate being unable to explain away my poor behavior in any meaningful way. I’m so embarrassed and ashamed of my behavior and I feel like my world is ending. I don’t even have a good excuse for why I pushed it so far. It doesn’t even feel like me doing my actions, but it obviously was. 

I know that I’ve been very overwhelmed lately with financial concerns and I’ve felt the meltdown building in the background. I tried to preempt it by taking the meds that typically manage it but that wasn’t enough. I’ve also tried asking for space/time alone at home to recenter since that usually helps too, but that wasn’t able to happen. I am also on my period which makes my sensitivity and reactivity to much worse. I know these all sound like excuses, but I’m just trying to not feel like an innately horrible person. I understand what causes my overreactions and I don’t want to think it’s all my fault, but I also don’t want to shift blame. I can’t escape the fact that the consequences apply to me alone when I’m the one having the overreaction. I know my actions are my choices and I have to own up to the hurt I cause regardless of the reason behind it.

I’ve apologized profusely since I realized in the middle of last night how fucked up I was being, but obviously that doesn’t change or fix the hurt I caused immediately, which sucks. We’re not at odds necessarily now and he’s accepted my apologies and told me I don’t need to keep apologizing, but it’s still tense and I know I’ve hurt him deeply. We are trying to make things work and get through this fight, but I feel like I’ve just ruined everything and like it’ll never get better. I know that’s just a feeling and that I’ll be okay in the long run, but it’s a really hard day today.

How to stay strong?,1700928843.0,"Background, im 33F, got diagnosed at the beginning of this year. spent all year in bed and self destructing.

ive been living with my inlaws for 17yrs and struggling. my family has never supported me financialy and its always been hard for mentally.

So long story short, my brother had a baby, my mum got divorced, she promised to help me with a downpayment for a home (ive been saving up for over 10years), and then at the beginning of this year she just gave all the money to my brother, that he needs it more than me

so i completely freaked out and that eventualy got me in front of doctors and got the diagnosis because i just breakdown when i have to explain my bio.

so yeah by october i realised that i cant rely on anyone and have to help myself. so i got a job as an accountant working from home (i thought not seeing ppl wud be better for my mental health (i can cry and nobody will see), but its been a blessing and a curse. yes now im feeing more productive, so busy with work i dont have time to ruminate and spiral). but the curse is im even more AWARE now that i dont have a decent place to live, im constantly apologising for my presence, the job has a lot of face meetings and im always trying to find a place to work in the house where i wont be distrupted, im mainly in my room but its hard when my partner is there too. his parents disturb me and make noise when im in face meetings, and im constantly apologising to everyone

&#x200B;

we dont have enough for the downpayment, my family says they are ""working on it"" and ""have pacience"". I hate living here, its the main thing that fuels my bpd as i dont feel in control or safe here and its a constant pressure.

&#x200B;

ok so now for the point of this post. the rational plan is to continue to work here, like this, for 1 year. in order to ask the bank for a loan for what we need i need to have a permanent contract, and that takes a year, during this year try to save up more and then get the loan and then go and be happy. so up to there, nice right?

&#x200B;

So im overwhelmed, and feeling like i know what i have to do, just how can i be strong enough to keep going. most days my mind tells me to just end it, im not strong enough. other times to just run away. and other times it tells me im doing great and to be proud of myself and keep fighting for what i deserve.

I have been told by my psychiatrist that I had ""borderline tendency"" but didn't meet the disorder criteria yet. I suffered a lot of trauma and pain in early childhood and young adulthood: abandonment, constantly changing caregivers, abusive NPD father, domestic violence, abortion, emotionally abusive and controlling husband, went through hospitalization because of a stupid overdose, went to casinos, spent money recklessly out of revenge for husband's treatment, guilt, more guilt, more self discovery, more fear, and more desperation. 

I now am the mother of a baby boy and I really don't want my disorder to get in the way of me taking care of him or being his mother. I'm certain I have a lot of love to offer him and I am seeking all the help I can get... But regulating emotions is really difficult for me and my husband uses my mental breakdowns to threaten me that he would take the kid away, and that I'm an unfit and irresponsible mother.

TW: self-harm/suicide mentioned
the last 2 weeks (?) ive felt a lot of improvement in this area. week 1 (? im not too sure on the time frame so im saying 2 weeks) when i got upset i thought abt hurting myself, but i was able to remind/tell myself that i do not deserve that or need to do that, & the thought went away. going into week 2, i havent had a single thought of hurting myself or suicide (week 1 i didnt have any thoughts of suicide either). self-harm has been smtg i struggled w. i used to do it a couple nights in a row, then for a period of time id stop, but it would recycle. i havent actually hurt myself in about a month (i havent cut in a while, but when i got angry i did punch myself in the legs). 

im very proud of myself & i hope to continue to achieve new things, but, if there are any set backs, i will get thru it & get back up. 

i just wanted to share how i am doing/where i am at, & also remind you all that if you arent at the place youd like to b at that you can get there. it will take time, but that time is so important. ive felt very motivated recently, & i hope all of you can soon or in the future. one day at a time.

Need advice,1700292343.0,"Mother in law is BPD and I’d love advice

My wife is my mother in laws FP. She’s been the biggest support for her mother throughout her whole life. I knew they were close when we started dating so I made sure to build a relationship with her mother and father. 

We had a great relationship until I asked for their blessing to marry her. They gave it in joy but the only thing her mom said was “my biggest fear is you’ll take my daughter from me”

No worries I thought, I had 0 intention of doing that. In fact, I moved across the state to be closer to them for when we did get married.

Then out of nowhere her mom started making up negative things I did. I tried talking to her about it in an empathetic way and she’s hug me and say thank you so much for validating my feelings and I’m glad you get it. 

But then she’d keep doing it. And then she started trying to get my financee to defend her from these imaginary situations by telling her she needed to make me apologize. I was baffled because every time I’ve interacted with her mother it’s been ocerwhelmingly positive. My fiancée was starting to get depressed because she felt torn between the two of us so she told her mom that now that she’s getting married she wanted her mom to talk to me if she had a problem. Additionally she said that once she was married she wouldn’t talk on the phone for 4 hours a day but that she still wanted to be close, but just take some distance.

This led her mom to threaten to kick her out of the family if she didn’t leave me. My wife refused and then after talking with a therapist and trying to set boundaries with her mom decided she needed to detach for a period of time. 

After about 60 days of detachment she wrote a letter to her mom explaining how much she loves her but how much her mothers actions hurt her but that she wants to have a relationship with her and have her in our lives.
She asked only that her mother respect that she not be put in the middle between her mom and me and that her mother speaks with me. (After she wrote a letter so did I trying to reconcile but she has not responded to anything I’ve sent) 

Her mom replied by refusing to acknowledge any of the hurt that she caused and then trying to put my wife in the middle by asking her to help her mom
Write a response to me. 

My wife kindly restated her boundary and then said that she wants her at our wedding but that she needs to respect her boundaries. 

Her mom guilted her dad (who previously she wouldn’t let talk to me or my wife)  into telling her that he didn’t have any reasons but that he felt her mom was right and that they wouldn’t attend the wedding ever and that he wouldn’t walk her down the aisle. When she asked why he started crying and said “I don’t know but your mother feels it’s the right thing”

We got married and to this day she has tried everything from lying to all our friends, trying to claim we’re going to hell, trying to leverage money (we’re both successful and don’t need her money), endless guilt trips, and many threats to get us to cave. 

She still refuses to respond to any text I’ve sent. She missed her daughters wedding. She’s broken her daughters heart. 


I’m sorry for the long post but I am having a hard
Time understanding how she can say she loves her daughter and do these things.  
I’m also confused about how to move forward. It feels like all we can do is keep the boundary with love, but if she wasn’t willing to simply talk with me to support her daughter at her wedding, then I am worried she’ll continue causing her worst fear —losing her daughter—possibly for the rest of her life.

Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Sorry this is my first post and I’m sorry but holy crap I need to get this off my chest
And trigger warning: S/H and sewerslide mentioned

I’m not sure where to start. I (23F) have dated this guy we shall call Renegade (25M)
He and I met around 3 years ago. We were both single parents and freshly out of a horrible marriage and engagement. When we first dated things were awkward. His ex wife still lived with him and she hated my guts. Used her limited knowledge of my past against me (her go to ammo was the fact I had my daughter under surveillance for accused child neglect by DSS (side note that shit got thrown out the window and I got her back once the investigation was over and the accusations against me were deemed as false) and she would even go as low as the issues with my mental health despite the fact she had “self diagnosed” herself with the same disabilities that I have) 
Freaky right?
Anyway ex wife threatened to take Ren’s daughter away if I wasn’t immediately thrown out of the picture so I was stuck in a game of “how can I get rid of my new girlfriend without getting rid of her?” Until the game got too old to play for ren and he ditched me. 
After not hearing from ren in almost 2 years he reached out to me. Told me he finally moved out of his ex wife’s house and had split custody. For a few weeks I was hesitant on being involved with him again. I even mentioned the fact I can’t trust him because of the abandonment and the drama. But spoiler alert I eventually had no choice but to move in with him and restart our relationship. 
Weeks go by and things are decent. He helped me get back onto my feet financially however the issues still remained and even got worse with my mental health. I was constantly facing relapse after relapse with my self mutilation. He verbally expressed how disgusted and sad he was to see my scars and hated the fact that I was still addicted to the pain. Therapy and medications can only do so much sometimes. 
This was the start of the big downfall. 
Months go by and I’m finally trying to open up. If I could talk about my depression and suicidal thoughts maybe it would lessen to urge to cut?
Only downside is he hated hearing it. He would constantly bring up his dead grandfather and the trauma he had been given due to his death as a way to get me to stop talking. 
It seemed fair. 
And then when I got the memo to literally just shut up about my problems it created a psychological warfare. 
He would say or do something that would hurt me, I would shut down and not talk, and then he would go on a tangent about his problems with my problems. Even go as far as to set up timers for how long I would lay in bed crying and not saying a word to him and even use it against me. And when he realized that the verbal patronize on my issues wasn’t going much of anywhere because I can’t change overnight, he would go back to square one. 
The concept of “I don’t like how your body looks” 
And then cutting began all over again. And he would get angry. So angry as to yell at me, threaten to throw me into a psych ward and cut off all ties to me again. 
It didn’t stop. 
I couldn’t stop. 
I am a young broken hearted person that didn’t want others to fix me. I just want to stop being angry all the damn time. 
He wanted someone to fix; someone who had a happiness to control. 
Yes I did do and say things that were equally hurtful to him. He had insecurities too and I openly used some of them against him whenever I had the chance to walk away from his rant sessions of using my insecurities against me. Cat and mouse. Eye for an eye. A Mental western gun battle. 
And one day I had enough. Enough fights. Enough patronizing. Enough begging. Enough screaming and crying. Enough of asking him to show that he cares the way I want him to care. 
I was too angry to be civil so I went to war. 
I told him the way he talks to me when I’m already down is enough to make me want to die. I told him if he didn’t want to care (because he said it during a fight when it came to my emotions and why I was annoyed with him saying “I don’t care”) then I wasn’t going to ask him to try anymore. I was done for the last time. 
When I got home from work hours after that fight, my last moments with him were just a matter of time. 
I was drowning in guilt and sadness and anger. And I wanted to say I was sorry. 
I can’t remember much of that night. All I remember is him yelling at me for locking the bathroom door and saying I’m just a parasite. 
But sometime after the fight I had decided to take my life through OD. One second I’m sitting on the floor reading my text messages and the next I’m puking on a toilet and trying to allow my body to drift to sleep. The worst part of this was that both of our children were eating dinner. You read that right. I tried to take my life in front of our two 2 year olds. 
Some hours pass and I wake up on the couch. I can’t speak. Breathing is hard. I can’t move. All I feel is nausea and pain in my head. 
Ren wasn’t pleased with my condition and he knew. Eventually he put 2 and 2 together and realized that I was dying right in front of him like I promised I would do earlier that day. 
That was back in early august this year. 
Well I’m not going into the gory details of what happened afterwards other than I got help. Didn’t have a choice but I got it. 
I moved out of Rens house and into my manager’s house- let’s call her Aurora. 
Aurora and I have known and worked with each other for years and she always kept her door open for me. I’ve been with her for 4 months now. Our relationship truly is good and we only ever had 1 serious fight. We did agree on the decision to take things slow given the fact we are both scared and insecure and batshit crazy. 
Anyway onto the “where we are now” for this useless post:
My mental health is still in the trash where it always has been for the past 16 years. And that’s okay. 
My issue is that with time- grief never goes away. So everytime I think of ren or mentally see his face I want to cry and kind of punch it. I wish I could say I’ve moved on and that I’m no longer hurt or sad or angry but 
Well
Grief is difficult. A part of me still loves ren enough to have him tucked away in a tiny corner of my life, another part of me wants him to disappear off the face of the earth, and even a bigger part of me just wishes that attempt didn’t fail just so I wouldn’t have to be dealing with this. 
So as your TLDR: I dated a shallow guy with a kink of verbal humiliation and attempted to take my life in front of him after I saw how much of a bad person I am and months later, grief is weird and never goes away.",Unanimousbeetle,,False,17xwwu1,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/17xwwu1/rantbssadstuff/

Actual opinions are of course okay like “I did not like this thing.” I want to feel completely accepted and safe to express all of me and my likes.

3. I do not feel valued or prioritized if my partner is openly ogling at other women in front of my face and in public.

6. I value effort and consistency. 

7. I do not appreciate when a partner says that I “make them feel like shit” just because I expressed that something they said hurt me, because it makes me feel as if it’s my fault for being effected in the first place. 

8. I will not perform emotional labor. I expect my partner to emotionally regulate themselves to an extent, just like how they expect me to.

Long Term FP While Having BPD Part 2,1700185832.0,"The phone calls continued, until one day we had school and they stopped. We kept in touch here and there, but it wasn’t the same. 

In December of ‘09, I moved to Chicago. Close, but not close enough. And at the time I was seriously drowningly  deeply in love with my now ex husband. On the day I went up to see my fp again, I was so ashamed of what had become of me I could barely speak. Ashamed at the life he fought for me to have that I lived so dangerously, ashamed that I had fallen in love with someone else, ashamed that this person wasn’t even half the man he is. Later, I found my now ex husband cheating on me (the first of wayyy too many) and I couldn’t stand to be there anymore. Like my darkness shouldn’t be touching him. I lashed out, and left to go sleep with someone easy I knew I could break. My fp knew it too, and I will never, as long as I live, forget the look he gave me when I left his house that night.

I want to scream while I type this. What a COMPLETE fucking moron I was. And a manipulative bitch to boot… but like I said. I couldn’t be with him. And that guilt made lashing out at others so much easier. 

We saw each other many many times since then, and there’s more that I could out here, but I won’t. There are some memories I hold to myself, so that no one else can touch them or taint them. Let’s just say we’ve always been friends, even if we weren’t talking. 

So here’s where we are now: at 30 years old he still lives where we grew up, and I live in Texas (don’t come for me I was dragged). I have two kids, am a single mom with 2 jobs, and I’d like to think I live a reasonably quiet life. I know the harm my BPD can do, and I try relatively hard to keep it in check. He doesn’t have any kids, but has a girlfriend that he’s been with for almost a year. She seems like a nice girl, and I wonder what attributes he admires about her.

Me? I’m a creepy fucking borderline who can’t drink because she’s hopelessly addicted, and has a continued obsession that even my long time therapist says is just part of who I am. I realized LONG ago that I chose my now ex husband because of similar attributes they both had. 

So here’s my truth, my life as I know it. And it’s not like we talk every day so keep that in mind:

I will always be hopelessly, addictively, loyally in love with my fp. I could never judge him, blame him, or find fault. Anything he would ask I would do. Bury a body, rob a bank, sell my soul, I’d do it in a heartbeat. I love him for all of the good parts in him, even the ones he doesn’t want others to see. And I love him for all the bad parts. I’ll take all of him for who he is, even if our tastes can be polar opposites at times. 

And yet- we’re not together. And Iv accepted now the fact that it won’t ever happen. And I’m okay with that. Okay with it because on some level I acknowledge that while I could be whatever he needed me to be, he couldn’t do that for me. I have trauma, and I live in it every day. And it’s not fair to drag him into that. I could say, well sure that would be his choice, but then what? Make him miserable until it ends badly? I would be fine with that, I could live, but would he?? 

I want, nothing more than anything in this world for him to be happy. I don’t care how that looks. Like literally could care less. I don’t even care if it would make him happy to never speak to me again. I would do it, and I would do it with a smile on my face.

Sure, there is the horribly selfish part of me that thinks I could be with him, give him everything he wants, and not look back. Indulge ourselves in what we know has always been there and won’t leave. Let go our cares for all the wrongs and rights in the world. Fuck I could scream about how badly I want to be able to be there for him. Love him endlessly so that he never wants again. But the selflessness I feel towards him will always trump everything, and it stops me in my tracks.

He knows I have a BPD, and yet I wonder if he’s really ever connected the dots all the way. Of course he knows on some level, but he’ll never know the whole reality. My reality. 

My hope is to those who have current fp, especially the short term ones, know that there aren’t many options for us. But this is where I choose to lay my heart down. Comfortably waiting so that I can dream and all that’s there is him.",jenniferstormcb,,False,17x3w6l,5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/17x3w6l/long_term_fp_while_having_bpd_part_2/
Long Term FP While Having BPD Part 1,1700185802.0,"
I don’t respond to posts very often, and I never post, so this is a first for me.
I want to share my experience being a long term sufferer of BPD, while having a long term fp, and how as an adult who understands the illness, feels every day. 
I welcome your comments, but in truth I write this for myself, and to help others to know that they aren’t alone. So here it goes: 

Iv known my fp since I was 11 years old, us now being 30. Truthfully, we dated for whatever constitutes as dating at eleven years old, for roughly 8 months. There was no real break up, and this being my first relationship, was not old enough to understand how I felt. BPD didn’t help. I didn’t feel heartbroken or sad, nor did I think to the future in regards to us. 

Summer break ended, and suddenly he was there, and I can honestly say that this is when hyper fixation set in. But in truth, we were also friends. Talking to him wasn’t easy, but I followed him like a lost puppy, and the air was almost intoxicating to be around. I never left his side, but we never acted on things. We were kids dating other people, and respected that fact about each other. 

But then we kissed, for like, a mere 10 seconds. I was in bliss for a whole day, until the next day, when I saw how terribly upset he was. My BPD broke me. I disassociated with the person who was selfish, was over joyed, and turned into a person unlike any person Iv ever been to anyone else. Selfless. I apologized, and our friendship went back to normal. 

In January of ‘08, I was brutally raped by my boyfriend and his brother at the time. I can say that my friendship with my fp took a toll then, as I recoiled into myself. My family life was taking a toll on me too, but that’s a completely different subject. On a shitty, cold, snowy day, we happened to meet by chance while he was on his bike, and we talked for no more than 15 minutes. He made me feel more alive than I had in months, and I vowed to get better for him, even in secret.  

To give a small bit of context here, I fully acknowledge the obsession at this point. I used to watch him, every.fucking.place.he.went. I knew his locker I knew his code, I knew what my ringtone was and I would call on purpose at the library so that I could hear it from feet away. We went to dances together and I got to pretend for a few hours. I about tore girls to shreds should they so much as look in his direction, and they found me crazy enough to believe it.

And then I fucking moved. Not a few towns or hours away. Not even states away. I moved across the fucking country, and I was utterly and completely alone. So so so alone I couldn’t stand it. Dealing with an eating disorder that was making my hair fucking fall out, abusive parents bent on hitting me, a traumatic rape that drove me to alcohol among other things. I cannot and will not attempt to convey the feeling that dominated feelings at that time in my life. All I can say is that I was slowly dying, and my resolve to stay alive was going with it. 

And then… out of nowhere… he was calling me. Waiting until 11pm in the Midwest to call me at 9pm in California when long distance was free. He convinced me, pleaded with me, not to do it. He’s the only one Iv ever told about my rape up to that point, aside from my parents who to this day think it’s a lie. Instead of being cruel he was vengeful. Instead of laughing at my pain he empathized. He cared about me. And at the time, he was the only one who did. No one forced him to call, he wanted to. And even now it makes me cry. That moment, that phone call, forever changed the trajectory of my life. To this day it created a bond that no one, not even himself, can break.",jenniferstormcb,,False,17x3vs4,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/17x3vs4/long_term_fp_while_having_bpd_part_1/

Goodbye ritual?,1699968994.0,"I’ve been seeing this guy for the last few months that I’ve become completely enamored with. though, it’s taken over my life and all of my emotions. this would be a very common thing here so you get it

But for the first time i actually had things going for me.

I’ve finally moved out of my abusive household, i’m studying at university (it’s interfering with this significantly), i’ve been discovering myself, i’m making friends, i’m getting help.

For once i want to take care of myself and i don’t want it to be ruined with an obsession for some guy who does not care for or about me the same way

He cut it off romantically and sexually after I cried about feeling used. The last time I really spoke to him he was treating me pretty poorly, and he’s been ghosting me ever since. It’s very likely that this relationship is as good as dead

I’ve heard of people using rituals to mark the end of a favorite person relationship, and I think that would be really helpful for me right now. Though I’m not sure what to do. Does anyone here have any suggestions or experience for this specifically? 

(Also, I want to say that I don’t want any assumptions of judgements passed here. Posting about this in the past in relation to bpd has previously been a very enforcing, negative part of my previous FP relationship. Or made me feel like I’m not allowed to have standards for the way I’m treated. 
One of my main symptoms is carefully curating myself to be someone who is desirable and manageable, which includes thinking intensely about how I’m being perceived by my person. I don’t want or need someone to try to offer his perspective)

Advice Wanted - Space after arguments not matching up,1699964357.0,"Hi! I (22f) have known about my bpd for several years and am in therapy regarding it, however I was wondering if anyone had advice on a specific issue.

When my partner and I get into an argument, they often need more time and space after it than I do. This often leads to me seeking reassurance and company too early, and we tend to start another fight.

I know that the answer is to be mindful and be aware of their need for space, but how do you handle the feeling of abandonment that tends to come with it? I find I feel abandoned because it means that I don't get to spend the limited time we both have with them (we live together but we both work full time and have other commitments) and then I worry that they won't come back.

Are there techniques you use to cope with thoughts like these? Or ways to self-reassure?

to anyone this may help,1699643082.0,"hey there! i (f18) was just diagnosed w bpd this past june. up until then i was mostly aware that likely i had bpd, & had got it confirmed by a psychiatrist. 

bpd is very hard to deal w, & its very hard to understand. whether youre the one suffering from bpd, or you know a pwbpd. bpd is very complex & is misunderstood. theres many resources online to learn abt bpd, but some cites have misinformation. bpd is a spectrum. you may feel invalid of your diagnosis because you feel that yours isnt as severe as someone elses. thats normal! the truth is your diagnosis is still valid, regardless of your severity. 

recovery/remission is possible. for anyone who is in remission, or is working their way to that point, its a key point to know that even not meeting the criteria, you still need to actively b helping yourself. for someone who takes medication for depression, once they feel “cured” they may stop the medication & leave it at that. likely, symptoms will return because they relied on that but didnt help themself any other way. thats what i mean by its essential to continue to use those skills you learn even after reaching remission. 

i think a good first step is to inform yourself more on what bpd, & understand what symptoms you specifically struggle w. understanding those symptoms & how they look, will help you come up w ways (also how you & a therapist) to cope w those emotions & learn to work w them adaptively. it is a hard thing to do, im only now starting to really take into consideration how important it is to do so (& in general help yourself), but it is possible. our bpd wants us to feel that we cant b different, that we wont ever get better, but it isnt true. 

a really important thing to note abt recovery though is that you need to want to get better. in relation to that, its also important to not rely on someone else to fix us. we, & professionals, are the only people who can get us to remission. as well as its going to take time. give yourself that time & try to b patient w yourself. 

deep down, we are people who mean well, we just unfortunately dont know how to appropriately react & act in certain situations/w certain people.

dr daniel fox is a dr w a phD who specializes in personality disorders. he has a youtube channel w videos/playlists specifically for bpd (but also npd, aspd, & asd (anti social disorder, unsure if asd is proper abbreviation) so basically all cluster b). 
he also has a “the borderline personality disorder workbook” (its available on amazon, & on kindle, google books, etc). its workbook but also a informative book that helps us learn more abt what bpd is, the symptoms, triggers, skills, & more. 

its also important to seek therapy.

Most confusing relationship experience,1699638638.0,"Over the last year i have been through the strangest back and forth with a focussed person and it has been a real test for me. The person in question has a bunch of their own issues (of course) and not enough experience in life or in relationships to know how to handle their own feelings. The main issue is that they don’t know how they feel about me and their feelings are constantly fluctuating and constantly under their scrutiny. We were friends and then they wanted more and then they weren’t sure if they wanted a relationship, now they don’t even know if they liked me at all in the first place or if they just liked the attention i gave them. They genuinely do not know and i am splitting on them badly. I really wish i didn’t have focussed people and i feel like this experience has taught me not to befriend or date focussed people. Some individuals feed on the attention we give them and bask in the glow of our affections. And i care about them so deeply that i keep flipping between complete demonisation and wanting to practically be their therapist. I know that this whole thing is on them for not addressing their issues earlier and for starting things with me before they understood how they felt, but i cant help feel that if it wasnt for my bpd behaviours maybe things would be different. They arent a bad person. Just very confused and confusing and the whole thing is such a blur of hurt and uncertainty in my mind that i dont know what is even real anymore.

Stepping away from going regularly on the bpd subreddits.,1699449952.0,"Ever since I got diagnosed I got attached to the label and used it as it as an identity. Because of that I’m super sensitive to stigma and the rude things people have said to me on Reddit because of my post history and the diagnosis. It’s really hurt but over the days I’ve decided to just go ahead and try to re-evaluate my thinking. I go on these bpd related forums way too much. It’s not healthy for me and I know I’ve been using it as a way to have an identity.

I would rather move on with my life instead of constantly reminding myself of a dumb diagnosis I happen to have.

Getting ghosted whilst having BPD?,1699232894.0,"I have BPD and it honestly drives me INSANE. I'm normally very good at trying to manage my emotions but this onet thing keepts throwing me off. This has happened twice to me now on a night out. I guess I'm trying to remember the context of alcohol being involved, and maybe it was more of a ""casual"" vibe. But how do you understand that when the person if giving you attention all night and then just ghosts in the morning? Is it as unpredictable as my brain is telling me? Am I unconsciously setting myself up for rejection? Please do let me know. Here are some examples for context because sometimes I get logic confused with emotions and cannot always tell the difference. 

  
The first time, I was at a club, he kept coming up to me, he'd get me drinks, he'd be all hugging me and following me out for cigarettes. He invited me back to his place despite me seeing that there was not going to be anything intimate involved and we ended up talking for ages. He got me an uber home later on and got my number telling me he'd message me in the morning. Morning comes no message. It gets to early evening and I realise I might have left my ring at his place, so I message him and ask him if he is well and if he'd seen the ring. No response. This was about a month ago and I posted some snaps on my snapchat this weekend and guess who was the first one to see it? Like what is this behaviour???

  
Another time was last night, I was at a house party. I met this guy and he was telling me about himself and again following me the whole night, being extra touchy, getting to know me. He invited me and my friend to a house party that he was having in a few weeks. He kissed me on the cheek a couple times (maybe he was trying to go for the lips idk). But I did let him know that I was interested and I'd like to see him again, he again got my number and said that he'd message me for coffee. Its the next day and not one message. And I feel like he's gonna do the same thing as the above. Like I don't get it, it really both confuses me and upsets me as someone with BPD. Is this an experience that you share? 

  
Its so triggering to have someone so intense interest and then just ghost despite you thinking everything was going well.

I don't know what's up with my brain,1698695924.0,"Hi, I have been diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, Anxiety & Depression for several years. BPD is the newest one. 

I have no idea how to explain this, but I have a negative voice in my head (it's my voice) and I cannot distinguish between 'her' and my genuine thoughts. 

For example; 
I will frequently look at my kids, my parents, my boyfriend and it will say ""I don't love them/you"" 
I just had a baby a year ago and whenever he fusses the voice in my head says ""I hate you"" 
(It happens most frequently with my boyfriend &  kids)
It also disagrees with stupid shit like I'd think ""I'm going to have some water cause it's good for me"" and it will reply with ""no it's not"" lol 

She always tries to convince me of bad things, like for so long until I started showing the voice in my head consistently said I wasn't pregnant. 
She also said once I was showing that I would lose the baby. 
She also confidently told me before all this that I couldn't get pregnant. 

She is definitive and confident. And I am neither of those things...but yet, IT'S ME.

Like honestly, what the fuck. 

It makes me feel like a terrible person and it confuses the hell out of me, because it is MY VOICE saying all these terrible things. 

Do I really not love my children?
Do I really not love my boyfriend? 
Do I really hate my parents? 
I really don't think so, but damn is she good at scaring me and convincing me. 
Maybe water is bad for you lol 🥴

What the hell is going on in my brain?? 

I have no idea if this is a BPD thing or just a me thing.

Have you ever instantly snapped out of an episode?,1698693934.0,"i dont know how to describe it, i have been in multiple episodes where i am just so emotional. i would be anxious and upset, crying and starting to be erratic. personally, my episodes are mostly caused by my fear of abandonment, and from my experience, its hard for me to snap out of it even after receiving reassurance. i would still feel anxious, upset and although i have received what i was seeking for, i always needed time to calm myself down.

but then there were a few instances where i just snapped out of my episodes. for example, when im calling my partner and i keep calling out for them and i receive no response, my abandonment issues kick in and ill start getting anxious, thinking if they hate me etc. i would feel upset just as i would feel in an episode. then i would realised that i was muted the whole time, or that my partner was not with his phone at that moment so they did not hear me calling for them, and my anxiety would all go away in an instant, as if nothing happened.

People are not reciprocating for a reason,1698674933.0,"I think a lot of people with BPD may have this problem. I crave intimacy and want someone who will take care of me. This involves a lot of overstepping of boundaries and constantly initiating with others. I keep extending myself and giving others the love and care that I desire. But then I get upset when others do not reciprocate and make them feel guilty because they aren't meeting my needs. But it is not the job of others to take care of me just because I need it/want them to. If others aren't reciprocating it's for a reason. I am expecting constant love and affection but this is not how relationships should work. I would say I'm better off allowing others to dictate the dynamic of the relationship, because I am not capable of doing this in a healthy way. The best thing for me to do is to meet my own needs and stop expecting this from others. I need to start recognizing how much others are pouring into me.

Struggling with some things in regard to DBT treatment.,1698636329.0,"Hi guys. Thanks for your time. I'm living in the UK, and have had CBT and counselling. I found that neither of those were helpful. DBT is, but my only option to self administer. I've already noticed that distress is much easier to tolerate, I'm more mindful, etc. It's nice.

However - there are certain things I'm struggling with, and dont know what skills to apply to combat. These are two things.

The first of which is the awareness of futility, and fear of the future. I am painfully aware of the fact that tomorrow, my entire family could die, or I could face brutal abuse, and no amount of therapy skills could help me. Frankly, the world can be a horrible and cruel place, and it makes any amount of self improvement feel almost counterintuitive, and as though as the smart solution is to...Off yourself. I won't, I'm just aware of this thought pattern, and I think it impacts my commitment to the treatment.

The second is my struggle in identifying which of my interpersonal needs are valid, and which may be unfair. For example - my boyfriend and I had a fight last night because I felt as though he never listens to me (I was showing him YouTube videos, and he rolled over and groaned). Objectively very rude - but what degree of response is warranted? Or the time I got upset with him over something I completely made up in my head, and was quite unpleasant about? In the moment - how do you distinguish, find, and calmly communicate your own fair needs as a person from mental illness symptoms when they often feel identical?",recovet,,False,17jkbv2,5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/17jkbv2/struggling_with_some_things_in_regard_to_dbt/

Goodbye my love,1698538668.0,"
I’m trying to make peace with the realisation I’ll never see you again
We had everything once
And then we just kept hurting each other
Was it our unhealed wounds that did that
Or were we just not enough
I struggle with that thought
That you didn’t love me enough
Or perhaps at all
Even now after all we went through
The range of emotions
It still guts me that it ended
If I look back that jagged knife tears through again
As fresh as the first time
So I look ahead 
Pretend and forget and try to drown out the numbing ache that still throbs in my heart my throat my stomach
I tell myself you never loved me to justify the never seeing you again
But that thing that we felt that we knew made us special
It still exists and I don’t believe it’ll ever truly go away
Is having loved and lost really better than never having loved at all? I don’t think so. Memory is pain quite beyond anything else
And to carry these words I’ll never get to speak and these emotions never to be expressed
And remember a time where that existed
Is far too tragic and painful to bear
I must move forward and I must heal

I struggle with extreme splitting where I do things that generally go against my moral compass. I never split on my son but I do get irritable easy when stuff is stressful. When I get angry its almost like I become the monster I used to hide from as a kid and the thought of that when I come down from the anger turns into instant remorse, pain, and regret.

Post of appreciation,1698367863.0,"I want to preface this by providing some background context and saying that I do not personally have BPD. it was my ex that did - which prompted me to do more research into it and learn about the experiences of people with BPD. While I've long moved on from my previous relationship, the huge care and concern I have for this community is still there.

I just wanted to quickly say that reading all your experiences on here is extremely powerful, inspiring, and infectious. Whether one has BPD or not. To hear stories about people building tools, in order to understand and deal with their emotions, traumas or undesired behaviours. To seek growth through the ups and downs, instead of taking the easy way out of accepting defeat and sulking in sorrow. To see people helping each other on here by providing advice, guidance, encouragement, and validation, is uplifting and it is such a great display of humanity.

When I first heard about the condition and tried to do my own research in order to support my ex, all I heard about the diagnosis, and prognosis, was cast in a negative light. It was almost impossible to find hope among those subredits, communities, or forums. I often felt hopeless and defeated. This community is THAT very much needed hope.

"I had to cut off a friend for what believe is very valid and quite necessary but ugh I feel awful and i think he will absolutely hate me (which so be it, it was to protect my mental health). Also long post because I’m summarizing at least 5 hours of a call",1698173256.0,"I’m using a throwaway because I just don’t wanna mix this personal issue with my account. 


I have a (barely) 25yo friend who is a beautiful person but has much growing and healing to do. I’m (barely) 35 myself. We’re both Leo’s so the birthdays were recent thus “barely”, particularly in your early 20s  I think that matters. This friend is very strong willed and loudly opinionated, a quality I love in a person. I knew at 24/25 he needed to grow into that quality because as of now, it comes across incredibly aggressive…which he justifies with it being *passion* not hostility. There’s no difference in tone to the naked ear and I used context to discern his intented tone. I was similar at that age so I brushed it off, until the last few days.

For context, I have well treated, well managed and stable for the moment BPD. 10 years of incredibly hard work and disturbing memories recovered. Rehashing trauma. Learning proper tools to get what I need from others since all I knew worked previously was lying and manipulating. I had a traumatic af childhood, and I’m not sure the details of them are relevant. But my first memory at 2 years old was of my dad trying to kill my mom by running her over. He made sure to put me in the truck with him and I saw it first hand. My brother jumped and pushed her out of the way, thank god. But that being my first memory kinda shows where it started and intensified from. 

As a result I have been working my ass off at healing and learning to regulate my emotions, both in rationality and in the extreme nature of my feelings. Learning what sensations are which feelings. Learning to not be manipulated; I learned that skill by being emotionally manipulated and told who I was and how I am to behave (ie, being shamed for being an excited toddler getting loud). I grew up only knowing that manipulating and lying is the only way to survive and it’s all I had to work with anyway. **The take away here is I had to unlearn this, relearn, and then earn trust through accountability and honesty.**

This friend met me after a decade of growth: I understand why he may think my triggers are not of concern to him. But all I really ever asked of him was to not question my honesty and convince me the truth is just me being delulu, and to never tell me that I need to learn to be accountable as honesty and accountability have been the center of my growth and successful management. Unfortunately, just like BPD, these triggers will likely be for at minimum a long time and more likely, forever.

I asked if he could please avoid the triggers or phrase the issue more delicately. His response: **your triggers are not my problem**. Fair, but for context if he said what he said when I was in a slightly less solid place it could have caused legitimate harm because untreated I was dangerous. My defense system in overdrive causes black out rages where I’ve really hurt people.

Ultimately I can’t be around someone who can’t respect this small ask. I am w terrified of what I’m capable of and I need my friends help with the very few things that could bring me back. The entire way he handled that disagreement was inappropriate, selfish, and unhealthy. I found much hypocrisy in his words and his lack of respect for my mental health and regard for safety of those around me was ultimately the lynch pin. I just can’t  risk it. I am doing well. I really wish I had received a more mature understanding response. 

I just feel sad. He means a ton to me and introduced me to something resembling faith, something very new to me. I’m forever grateful, will forever love him, and let him know my door is open after a few years have started to allow him to develop to the man I know he will.

No one to talk about this with until therapy. Getting I out now while feelings are fresh. Also? I’m not being extra about this right? If not for the “your triggers don’t matter to me”, I would still feel safe enough to keep trying.

Is it the BPD or is it me?,1698099120.0,"I (F/23) have been with boyfriend (M/30) for three years on and off. You can probably understand why I have been on and off because of the insecurities and outbursts on my behalf. 

Over the past couple of months I have cut out alcohol and anything that has been bad for me. I only vape instead of smoking. I have also been assertive with my mental health. Prioritizing it, staying off social media, meditating, journaling etc. The outbursts have come protect stopped, when I feel jealous I can cope better now and don’t blow up my partners phone. 

My behavior have improved over the last couple of months and I’ve been proud of myself. If an argument occurs I’ve been able to walk away, reflect, apologize and actually act “normal”. 

This was until last night. My boyfriend had a FWB before me, they’ve been friends years. But a few months before me, he had slept with her. He had told me she was in love with him and she had beat him up before as well as forcing herself on him. Now, she isn’t the best looking and she’s a bit bigger which isn’t my boyfriends type so I’m not sure if he’s embarrassed about their relationship and lies about some of this, who knows. 

Anyway, my boyfriend has absolutely NO issue blocking me in the past, but to say this girl has beat him up and forced herself on him I think that’s a pretty good reason to not speak to someone who knows. When my dog passed away, he came home drunk and had been out with her (she posted it on Facebook, I was never aloud to post pictures of us though) He told me when he broke up with me before they lay in bed cuddling naked. Again, not sure if he was lying and they slept together but who knows. I There has also been occasions where we have went out (had our own place) and when we’ve argued he’s slept at hers. I genuinely have moved past all of it but it’s still relevant they have a history to say the least. 

I won’t lie, in the past this has caused uproar from my behalf which I’m in two minds about. On one hand I shouldn’t of yelled and screamed and cried about it but also what’s the correct response when you’re in love with someone who has lied about seeing someone they’ve slept with? I’ve done everything. Crying, arguing, screaming, ultimatum. Doesn’t work. He just says he won’t ever stop speaking to her and they were friends before they had sex. 

Three fucking years I’ve endured this with BPD, calls from her, receipts with her name on in his car. Having to meet her early in our relationship and not knowing they slept together feeling like stupid. Yes I know I’m stupid I know everyone is going to say leave him that’s why I’m on here hopefully people with BPD with know how when you have a favorite person how hard it is to let go. 

Last night she texted him at night, I saw it (didn’t see message) went downstairs put the TV on low and tried to sleep. He came down following me asking what was wrong after a while I gave in and said what do you think? He said did you see her text me I said yeah, I don’t want to argue we can talk about it another time, he made me come upstairs I didn’t argue or say a word I was proud of myself I said after work call me for a talk. I did it all right the whole I love you and care about you, but I feel hurt because you’re still in contact with someone you’ve slept with and I wouldn’t do that to you I don’t speak to people I have etc. He basically just broke up with me again saying he needs to think! HE NEEDS TO THINK he turned it around on me saying I’m jealous and crazy. Am I ? I for the first time feel like I have my shit together and I’m sane?

Am I crazy or did I use my skills/boundaries properly?,1697085744.0,"(Originally posted in r/BPD but since I'm in recovery for awhile with my BPD I thought posting here would be better)

Update as of 10/13:

//My husband and I ended up looking through other messages between social medias we used together to come to terms with their behavior and again, find more patterns because I'm still trying to fight against their gaslighting. What we found was years worth of posts switching between talking absolute ill of our friend group and idolizing me, dragging and making very long hateful posts anytime one of us ended up in a relationship, the amount of hate and jealousy filled posts related to me was so nauseating that I've been sick for the past 15 hours. There's a lot more but I don't think it's quite on topic for this thread.

I feel much more confident and happy with myself that I was able to control my emotions regarding this situation and know I really did make the right decision. Thank you everyone for the support as well 🧡//

Long story short I had to end a friendship recently due to my boundaries not being respected and asking for mutual respect/support in specific areas of my life.

 I've brought them up for over a year until it got to a point where I needed to take time away to think about my future relationship with this person as their actions were not only harming me mentally but settling into my relationship with my husband and kids (my husband is aware of my diagnosis and is very patient with me. However, I did split more regularly during the times after interacting with this person which initially made us realize maybe I needed to reevaluate the friendship.) I've been going to therapy for my BPD for 6 years, know my subtypes, know my triggers, know when I need to step away and use wise mind. I have multiple workbooks that he and I do together in between the times I don't have therapy to keep up with my recovery as I very much want to work on myself and have for years.

Here is where I feel like I'm crazy: after bringing up that we needed time away from each other and go our separate lives and stating why, I am hearing from others that they're telling people that I abused them. That I sent hateful messages and that I was clearly devaluing them because they've been researching BPD for a little. I was very confused. Had my MIL, FIL and other family look at the messages. They said what I said wasn't hateful. I even showed my therapist and she said no and that I shouldn't be made to feel guilty for putting my kids first regardless of my diagnosis or not.

Am I crazy? Did my black and white thinking kick in? Or did I truly do the right thing and trusted myself? So many people use my diagnosis against me and many times I have to spend DAYS making decisions so I can make sure I'm not reacting out of pure emotion. However, this is my family and they ARE more important to me than anything else. I know after this I don't want them around me or my family ever again anyways, especially for what lies they're spreading. 

Being a mom with BPD is hard but I will always put them first. Their safety and security is most important to me. So why do I still feel bad for ending this friendship?

To update as of today as well with talking with my therapist; she mentioned that my friend is probably a covert narcissist and that it is common for them to shift blame, lie, and fake memory issues to avoid accountability. And since I have BPD that my friend probably dipped and played into that against me, especially since i was never originally diagnosed with it during the start of our friendship.",WanderingFoxWitch,,False,175yhrw,5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/175yhrw/am_i_crazy_or_did_i_use_my_skillsboundaries/

So first a bit about us. You can skip to the question if you want.

My wife with BPD and i are together since 2008. We were at the tim 16 and 19 and did go through alm rough times together.
She got diagnosed at first with depression during our relationship and at the age of 18 with BPD and ADD. We did go to different therapist over the years. Some more usefull than others. She had for around one year a really creative one, who brought some ideas for her sleeping problems, but dropped out of the profession due pregnancy. She has now a therapist specialized on DBT. And she did some hughe improvements.


Question;

Now that she made hughe improvements in the last half of this year, but still struggles a lot with nightmares, where she falls back in her childhood, mixed with her current life.
We're now hoping to find something, that might her help with this. It really bothers her, since she feels like every progress she made, isn't there. In addition, she's not well rested.
Anyone had similar problems? If so, what helped you?

He is handsome, not gonna lie, but I’m in a higher league (my feeling and his words) but he keeps doing the same thing for a couple of years now - saying to me that he is so handsome, well-built, has so nice hair and this kind of stuff that makes me think higher of himself and less of myself. He sometimes told me things lime your teeth is yellow, you look better in dry hair than in wet hair (what the hell?) and generally things that made me feel worse after. I have confronted him about this straight away and also some time after and O got the explanation that he was stupid and that he regrets it but I still feel miserable sometimes thinking that he’s capable of saying things like that. I know that his words are not very painful, he’s not a bad guy, but I’ve experienced men before who only complimented me and never said this kind of things to me, so whenever I experience that I feel extremely sad.

How has BPD affected your creativity?,1696729517.0,"In a sense, BPD can be very good for creativity/creative endeavors. After all, it isn’t uncommon for pwBPD to have frequent episodes of mania in which they are stuck with profound ideas and inspiration that propels them into action, nearly effortlessly and totally intuitively. But there is another characteristic of BPD that renders this manic sort of creativity less useful.

Have you ever heard of pwBPD being called controlling, manipulative or even abusive in the way they behave towards others? If you have, i’d like to assure you that although there is a hint of truth within those words, there is just as much if not more stigma and misinterpretations built into those assumptions of the disorder. Whatever the fact, it’s true that pwBPD do on occasion try to control other’s perceptions of them. There are many reasons for why this is the case, be it emotional fragility, fear of abandonment, and so forth. It’s often a mix. And it is that same manipulative tendency that extinguishes any sort of creative potential that a person suffering with BPD might have been able to realize. And manipulation isn’t the only one.

There are countless other frankly shit aspects of the disorder that makes it impossible for the borderline to fully self-actualize. Sure, some have been able to achieve great things and produced beautiful pieces of art and science but not at a cost. Whether it be to themselves, their close relationships or something else entirely. You will never make healthy progress by ignoring the borderline side of yourself.

So I confronted them I said it didn't really feel like they were listening to what I was going through, and their response to me was I'm sorry you felt that way that is when I went absolutely ballistic and started going off on them. I was like no offense but I feel that is not a real apology and their response to me was as your instructor I don't feel comfortable having this discussion it pushes a boundary that I do not want to go over. I then told them I understand but I can't be around you so I would like to have the lectures pre recorded. We then had a discussion where they basically told me they felt abused by me. I told them that I felt like they were disregarding my feelings. They told me that they almost decided to kick me out of their class but they remembered that they had made a promise to me they wouldn't do that to me because I had told them about an experience with a different professor that I had had and they didn't want to do the same thing to me.

TW loss of beloved =^. .^=,1696453076.0,"I am so heartbroken for my sweet and tough little boy, you could tell he was always doing his best.  He had to earn my trust back after he thought I was his girlfriend and did a lot of inappropriate elimination, but we eventually got there, after a fashion.  He's been a big factor in my anger management, he did not deserve to be screamed at for being underfoot when he is just being engaging and inquisitive.  It's not his fault one of his humans has issues.  ETA: I took my anger management much more seriously when I saw it making me angry at a pet and part of my family, I was not yelling at my cat often, and put in work to reduce that to never.

Lately I've been making a point of picking him up more, and holding him for longer.  For the first time in a long time, last night I held him sleeping on me, swaddled in a little tie dyed towel.  Then his brother came along and slept next to him, even resting his head on his brother's side.  It was super sweet, and I was looking forward to seeing if they would both sit on me again today.   I was planning on walking around while holding him and doing everything else one-handed, to inject a little bonus quality time into his day.  His claws have been getting long and I was going to clip them later this week.  

I've been caring for a family of senior and elderly cats for several years now.  We lost his mother last year, which truly shattered my heart but I knew it was coming and our bond and even its loss has been the source of so much healing.  She made the pain of processing the pit of grief deep in my soul worth it; the memories set off the torrent of eternal grief like water from a fire hydrant, but at least I got to experience those memories and the joy they still held, still hold.  I dissociated a tonne all my life, the pain of particular memories is the s. h. I would use to cause the pain to trigger it.  So I've learnt to give those memories an emotional hug, that's how I think of it, and taking a step back while I keep checking in on myself.  The loss of their mother really hit the brothers hard; in hindsight, it's a little surprising how well they've done.

There are big things to be grateful for: up to the end he was aware of where he was at (home), while eating a freshly opened can of cat food.  Nothing external hurt or scared him, my bf spent time with him before letting him outside as he'd been asking me to do also for most of last night.  I even did let him out in case it was him wanting to pee on the grass or something, I was happy to accommodate him. <3 I kept checking on him until he came back to the door.  I cared how he felt and what he wanted to do.  I am so sad I didn't get just a little more time to do nothing but hold him, he enjoyed it so much.  The first thing I did when I got out of bed this morning was check if he'd wandered somewhere treacherous in the driveway in his quest for sunbeams.  He wasn't, so I continued with toothbrushing and tidying, started a coffee and went to the door to bring him in for some good holding, and found the time for that had past.

This is really hitting me hard, I have already upped my self care and I think this is a good time to access therapy services again, this is defo a crisis with a couple things piggybacked on each other.  I wish I could have done more for him than I did.",ferrule_cat,,False,16zyfis,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/16zyfis/tw_loss_of_beloved/

I'm terrified my partner is cheating,1696423146.0,"I've been diagnosed with BPD 4 years ago. It helped me tremendously, It meant i wasn't crazy and the things I've always felt were legitimate and had an explanation. From there I started treatment with medication and therapy and DBT skills and my life got more balanced. 

So now I've been in a serious relationship for 3 years. We got married and had a baby and I'm currently pregnant. We both work from home and he is a very present father and husband, he is always with us. He is not secretive with his phone and gives me no reason to think he is cheating. 

However my BPD brain thinks something is happening. I downloaded an app yesterday for school (telegram) and saw he had an account and was last seen online last month. I freaked out and accused him of using it for cheating and he got extremely mad I and began to react saying he was making his bed and that this was the beginning of the end. I calmed down a bit and asked him to explain why he had downloaded it but he got defensive and said he doesn't need to justify himself. I began spiring, that hadn't happened to me in a while, this is the first relationship I have that I didn't cheat and we built a family so I feel super vulnerable. 

I'm not sure where I'm going with this but maybe someone has some insight or tips on how to handle this, my first instinct was always to ""cheat back"" once I've felt threatened.",SilverGirl-,,False,16zm5er,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/16zm5er/im_terrified_my_partner_is_cheating/

Some help here.,1696407970.0,"

Can anybody help me. I am all alone. I am 31 yo Indian man.I feel stagnant in life. I have never been in a relationship and never will be. 
I have a family that has mental health issues. I got them from age 16. I know no one cares for this too but atleast some might gaze through.
I have no talent. I lived my life fighting what was diagnosed OCD and anxiety in the beginning and now after 15 years passing through psychotic diagnoses, has reached dependent traits hyper vigilant and now I conclude based on years long suffering and self redirections, and recent counseling that involved a psychometric test as a form of bpd known as quiet bpd. Now, before seeing my worthlessness right away for a relationship, I am not harmful like the other bpd types( even though they suffer much more and get no help from society), mine is not evident and hence took so long to find. 
Now, I have no purpose in life no self image, dependent, people pleasing( I hate myself for that, because world is so selfish when I look it through my bpd glasses.)I worked in different domains in a job I got and now I am a jack of all.
I hate myself.
I don't want this life. But I am not suicidal. I just want to walk away. Just avoid the trauma altogether. You know what on top of all this I took an snri a few years ago along with the high dose ssri(prescribed) without asking anyone or consulting, because I felt ( rn I am sure nobody will read it but there is a very small hope a little light, a fantasy rather. It's very painful to recollect it in a way that conveys my situation here).
So I took that snri because I felt so down and afraid of myself and my future as I stayed alone in the apartment and thought atleast I overcome that fear, because somehow I had to complete the integrated mtech that was the only way forward for me. I did all the work I could and somehow got out with some experience and the degree sponsored by the company.
In the end, here is the funny part, the snri complicated my condition. I have this frozen feeling with no emotions. I was in a constant fight or fright mode and it even affected my health. I started feeling zero hope in life. All I could do was sit on a bed and being I don't know just felt empty all the time. Actually I stopped feeling anything, let alone fear. No docs could help. Because I don't know how to relax. I am processing that stressed state in some other way
that I can't let go. I just start to panic when I feel stressed. I tried many relaxation techniques like emdr and eft and all that. I am now using CBD daily and it is helping my psychotic mind as well as slowly I am able to process the stuck energy.

My partner was following other women on tiktok,1696407216.0,"Edit: 
I asked him for the password after two women came forward saying they were in a relationship with him. I found no evidence of that though. But I asked him for his password because of those women coming forward. So it was a different reason why I asked. Not because of the followers on tiktok. The women on tiktok didn't have many followers. It was like he knew them personally or something to be following them. His TikTok is ""handsome*insert name*"" and all his followers are women. He doesn't mention me at all on there. Hopefully that clears some things up. In saying that, it doesn't justify asking for his password at the end of the day or invading his privacy. I realize that now after reading the comments. However I receive mixed advice depending were I post. On a women's group I was told it's justified. Here I'm told it's not. I think it best I just ask my therapist and not ask online for relationship advice 

I asked for his TikTok password so I can always log into his account. I also have his Facebook account. He has never cheated on me but he used to chat up a lot of women before we became a item. On his TikTok I found multiple women he followed back after the requested to follow him but not messaged. I got mad and he said ""are you serious?!?"" He said I can get rid of them then since I'm on his profile anyway. So I did. These women were posting sexual suggestive content that had added him. I'm hurt. I even posted a video on his TikTok asking that any girls reach out to me if he has been talking to them. But no one came forward. I asked on Facebook too, but no one came forward either.  (After the previous two women I mentioned above, no one came forward. Since I found no evidence with the previous two women, I saw it as not cheating. This however is a separate occasion) He always invalidates me when I tell him his done something wrong or gets upset at me but once he calms down, he normally apologizes.

My partner accused me of stealing his emotions (cross-post),1695830255.0,"My partner (m38) is also extremely mentally ill. He's erratic, mercurial and has bouts of explosive anger. It's typically not towards me specifically but he screams and stammers in this high pitch voice and when I (m30) get upset or freaked out and say anything, he tells me that I'm stealing his thunder and that I keep him from expressing his emotions because I make everything about me. He even suggested that he could prove it by manipulating me by faking emotions to see if I copy him. It's gotten worse since he learned that pwBPD have the potential for elevated emotional mirroring.

This is not my intention. I try to stay quiet and keep a cool head but sometimes I cannot keep from saying something or being physically affected (i.e. crying or having an angry expression) He is currently in the middle of an ongoing breakdown and as a result, literally anything that upsets me is considered paltry. He constantly asks me, ""what are you so sad about?"" As though I don't have a personality disorder, cPTSD, GAD, depression and a myriad of other fucked up shit from both genetics and a shitload of trauma. Our relationship is toxic but hey, unstable relationships are part of the game, I guess.

I have no job because my brain is fucking fried and he's under an absurd amount of pressure to work a job he hates and so I try to minimize what I can because he has so much responsibility. If he puts me down or accuses me of only caring about myself, like he often does, and I begin telling him that he is obviously better off without a burden like me, I get the routine, ""ope, here we going. Swinging the pendulum."" Or again, accusing me of trying to make everything about myself. He also gets angry if I don't say anything to him and will start asking, ""are you not talking to me?"" I have extremely bad days too and I can't express them without him claiming that I'm one upping him. I'm so exhausted.

I can't leave him because I have literally nothing. No money, no car, no family to rely on. My family essentially cut ties because I'm trans. (Today he also guilted me about not getting along with the rest of my estranged, bigoted family because both of his parents have passed away, whereas my mom is still alive and I have 4 siblings) I'm also fairly certain that if I leave, he might cease to exist. That's not even an exaggeration. I can't have him committed because he'd lose his job and everything he has. I can't commit myself because I'd be seen as attention-seeking.

As the child of an alcoholic, I guess it's no surprise that my partner of eight years would end up being one too. He's been sober for 9 months and constantly reminds me that it wasn't his choice. (He had become increasingly emotionally abusive over a period of a couple years and I was trying to make plans to leave him.) I'm not sure two people with these levels of mental illness can be together without destroying each other. I can't fall apart because he's falling apart. I can't feel joy because he can't feel joy. I can't be upset because he is upset.

There's nothing left. I want to not be in existence anymore so so often but I'm trying. I'm in therapy and on medication that doesn't fucking help, I've done workbooks, done things affirm important parts of my life, I've set and achieved goals and in the end, everything in my life is a fucking wreck and so much of it feels like it's my fault. Maybe I really am an emotional vacuum.

I'm trying hard to keep it together. I'm trying hard to be the strong one. I am exhausted every day of my life, physically and mentally and it all just gets worse. Everyone leaves. My family, my friends, my other partners and my partner has emotionally checked out of our relationship. Every circumstance is fucked, the climate, the government, my family, my past, my relationships, my brain and even my pets. I don't know who I am from day to day. Apparently I am a selfish, attention seeking, spotlight thief.

Even now, I've made this whole post about myself, my needs and my emotions. I hate myself so much. I don't want this life or this body or mind. I hate me.

I know no one will read all of this and that it's filled with a thousand different directions of problems. I just needed to spill my guts somewhere where I can't hurt anyone else.

But instead he read my messages and saw the amount of pain I was in and ignored it. He then told me it's my fault for now saying all these things  (me repeating what he did to me) and not doing as I was told when he said to calm down and stop crying. He believes it is my fault. Multiple times when I have cried in the past he has not acted like this. Infact he has never acted like this before, well alittle, but never to this extent. but lately he has been. And I am now considering leaving him. For good. I don't think I can forgive him. I can't even look at him the same anymore. And he feels no remorse whatsoever.

I am scared of sex,1695386250.0,"When I was around the ages of 13 to around 14-15 ish I went through a lot of traumatic sexual experiences. I was never raped but molested in places like a hair salon and hospital. In both cases, I thought I would be raped. Had an experience when I technically consented but cried as my boyfriend took off my bra when I was 13, was pinned down by one of my friends, had one of my friends try to manipulate me into having sex with him, and had an awful experience with a former senior at my school who was 8 years older than me and a complete pedophile when I was 15.

I had a boyfriend until recently. I told him I would begin thinking about how I feel about penetrative sex around 6 months into our relationship from the very beginning. I told him that if I ever said yes, he to wait 2 weeks( initially said 1 month but shortened as he seemed unhappy). We later had sex less than 3 days after I tried to kill myself (around 3 months in). It hurt,  I didn't really want to try again but he got a little pushy so I did and faked as many moans as I could as usual. The second time around a week later I was just thinking about when will this end. The third time I said no despite him being pushy. I broke up with him soon after saying I had shit to work out.

I feel hurt and betrayed by him as well as myself. All my experiences when I was younger my dad said it doesn't matter and my only takeaway is to be safer. My mom said it's just a touch like any other place in the body. My parents would say molested is an ugly word. I have a regular sex drive but I can never feel comfortable with anyone, I can never finish if another person is involved even on text. It feels scary.

I think I'm scared of sex but also that I'm overreacting. I have had more negative experiences with any kind of physical intimacy that was after the age of 18 and not as bad so I have not mentioned that. I'm just being overdramatic I guess, but I honestly feel all my relationships are wrecked the moment things get physical.

I 18yo female have been diagnosed with bpd, critical anxiety disorder, and critical depression, since I was 13/14 years old. It’s been a long rocky road and still a long ways to go. The more that I age i learn more about my conditions and just how hard everyday if my life is going to be. These last two years have been the hardest I’d think, I disassociate to the point of panic attacks as I feel nothing around me is real, I’m afraid I am going crazy, and that I will be landed in a mental hospital, it is truely terrifying waking up every day, I dread waking up, not because I don’t want to live, but because I feel like I can’t even have a normal day no matter what I do. Yes I have good and bad days, but more bad than good. Substance abuse has definitely taken a toll on my psyche and it has only made things worse but I can’t seem to stop because it’s the only time I can feel comfortable with the symptoms I have. I have tried everything to cope with my symptoms and still I feel like I’m on the verge of a breakdown every single day. It’s so exhausting, just trying this out is giving me intense anxiety as I think about the future and how scary the way I’m feeling is. Does anyone experience the same thing? Am I going crazy?

A Word of Hope For Those In Middle Age Still Struggling With Their BDP,1695334482.0,"I woke up this morning to a post asking the relatively older members of the community (late 30s to early 40s) if they still struggle with the emotional roller coaster that is BPD. The OP asked if anyone else in that age group was still struggling with wild shifts in mood despite being told that their symptoms are supposed to stabilize in middle age. I’m glad to say that the OP found kindred spirits and I hope that was enough to comfort them with the notion that they are not failing at recovery.
As the day went on, I stumbled upon some interesting information that I think would be more helpful. I am currently listening to the audiobook “How to Be Sad” by Helen Russell (which I think many of us should, it’s a wonderful book, but I digress). She talks about the importance of letting ourselves feel our emotions lest they get pent up and rare their ugly heads later on in life. 
In her research and consulting of numerous professionals for the book, she found that statistics show that humans and monkeys are more likely to display symptoms of depression and emotional distress in their middle age, hence the term “mid life crisis.” Most of the experts she consulted mentioned that as you approach old age, the symptoms begin to lift as the stresses of middle age begin to subside. 
I found it rather helpful so I thought of sharing it with the OP. Thing is, I can’t for the life of me find the post. Im in three BPD related communities so I’ve decided to share this as a post in all of them in hopes it’ll make its way to the right person. 

While I can’t relate to the situation because I’m a little young (25, F), having the notion that there’s a reason this is happening and I’m not failing at my recovery is helpful. I hope that OP and the several kindred spirits in their comment section can also feel the same way with this info. 
Peace and love to all of you. 

TL;DR: If you’re older and struggling with your symptoms even though you were told this would slow down as you get older, you aren’t broken. There’s a scientific evidence that middle aged people are more prone to depression and emotional distress due to the stresses that come with it. Keep doing your best, the science also shows that it slows down once you get closer to old age.",TheUndrachiever,,False,16ot532,6,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/16ot532/a_word_of_hope_for_those_in_middle_age_still/

I (24F) have been with my husband (29M) for almost 6 years now, married for 2. I moved out of my parents house at age 18 into an apartment with him so i could escape my family life. Things developed and we ended up getting engaged and I cried for a whole week after, in fear of commitment. Ended up moving forward with the wedding but the whole vibe changed with him after that. He seems colder and doesn't ever want to do anything with me besides his own hobbies. It feels like I'm a burden and he acts like it's a chore to spend time with me. Short tempered and defensive.

Fast forward to currently I have been breaking down about 1-2x a week (including S.I). MANY friends and family members have been begging me to leave him but I haven't because I've convinced myself I have convinced them that he's toxic. It feels like it's all ramping up as I increasingly feel less happy and he seems absolutely miserable. I finally have a steady job and community outside of just him so I am in a position to move out but I can't tell if it's the right thing to do.

I spent the entire day today letting myself sit in the feelings. I processed through them. Truth is the cancellation really hurt and I got scared and paranoid that he was getting bored of me and so I avoided him the entire day so that I could gather my thoughts and feelings and express my thoughts to him in a productive and mature way. I didn’t want to give him the silent treatment. I didn’t want to be passive aggressive because I know better so when he asked what was wrong, I told him I needed time to gather my thoughts. Slowly but surely the conversation started. I admitted why I felt so upset however I made it clear that I wasn’t mad at him. I confessed that I need consistency and that I need to know when plans change instead of being left in the dark.  He apologized and we had a mature and adult conversation. 

And I’m proud of myself for that. That I didn’t lash out and give the silent treatment like I used to do to boyfriends when I was a teenager developing bpd. Instead, as a 22 year old I communicated my needs and feelings without attacking him or villanizing him.

Stuck at moving forward. (Venting/just going through it),1694953776.0,"So I'm really deep into my recovery and have recently become fully self-aware. I have know about the BPD for a year now and have made great strides in being a better person, but something eluded me. I was really unaware of just how toxic I can be in personal/intimate relationships, and damn I have ripped out some hearts. This has been something that really blindsided me, because, in theory, I try to be very reliable, trusting and  great partner. This is where my problem begans.

Once I began working on this part of myself, I rediscovered, yes rediscovered, that I am in a very toxic relationship. I discovered it about 8 years ago but didn't understand what I was dealing with, so I slipped right back into the trap. But... after spending over 11 years of our life together, having 2 kids and build the so called ""American Dream"", I have discovered I am married to a narcissist. She fed off me for all those years and I graciously gave her everything she could dream of, until I couldnt give anymore. It crippled me and led me to an unusual inpatient situation. I began getting better and stronger. 

I've always knew my wife suffered from co-morbidity, and we have been through a lot together. Even before we started building a life together, we were already extremely trauma bonded by professional situations outside of our control. So I have constructed a very well designed plan (I also have extreme OCD) with the help of my therapist, to actually help her and get her to change. 

Yes I know, ""you can't change a Narcissist."" But here's the catch, and if you don't believe do some research, but PwBPD have a very unique ability. Just like all the other women I have destroyed in my past relationships, 
I also have the ability to destroy narcissists, and that's just what I did. 

I have broken down her defenses and ripped her of her armor. Now as I stand above her, sword ready to strike, I hesitate. I see the small, broken and scared soul, that I have been manipulated to love, but it's still love. As I recollect on her past, and see how she got to now, and I know what her future can be. So I wait, patiently, ready to strike. As I gaze into her subconscious eyes, she knows it's time.  Either she'll be completely destroyed or she needs to began to grow stronger. As she starts unraveling our relationship, she began to see why I have labeled us ""The Demon and The Succubus,"" to which she replies to ""That sounds fun."" 

I know this is a ""patiences"" situation, but it tense and stressful. I know the outcome. Either we have to rebuild our relationship anew and aware, or we must completely destroy each other. I am prepared for both.",QuestionEven8267,,False,16kzgdh,3,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/16kzgdh/stuck_at_moving_forward_ventingjust_going_through/
2 Years on the Lonely Road,1694937686.0,"2 Years ago my girlfriend of 5 years packed her stuff and left in an Afternoon.

I did therapy and it helped me focus on myself  move countries get a fantastic job and I just bought a house.

But socially I've become completely destroyed. I moved into a tourisic Island as famly had an empty house there and I could save the monet for the house.

I met  during this time countless women through the apps. But all of them I completely self sabotage.

On the friends department I jump ftom fp to fp until they can't stand my clinginess anymore.

Days before my ex left me we where talking and I specifically  told her ""I know you'll leave me like everyone else does"" she gave me a kiss to my forehead and the rest you know.

This Summer I met a woman in a dinner with friends and imediately fell for her. Days later I couldn't get her out of my head. Looked fot her in numerous places just to give her my   number to no luck.

I ended up creating an instagram account to reach her (had deleted all social media when my ex left) and honestly it made me feel like an absolute crap when I saw her profile. She seemed like this uber woman with a giant than life life. 

Still I reached to talk with her and gave her my number. She imediately accepted to go fot a coffee. You guys have no idea the amount of self sabotaging I did with her. I woild be erratic im the messages extremely anxious as my blood pressure went up to a constant 17.

Needless to say it all came to an end when after ahe cancelled some plans I went on to declare my love for her ( we never had anything and had met only 4 times face to fsce) needless to say she still was nice enough to reply gently and kind and I doubled down with a giant message about keeping friendship.

What bothers me the most is knowing this is not me. I'm almost 40 and am behaving like I'm 17... I've had girlfriends, friends with benefits, unstable relationships but the fact I completely blew it like I'm imexperienced really makes a dent...

Just recently met this other woman through Tinder great chemistry and I was able to completely overwhelm her in 4 days. 

There where other cases from the apps I could mentiom as well.

So for now I'm done. I will embrace the deepeste recess of my loneliness just like I did when my ex left. 

Look deeply in myself and seek help from a therapist.

I'm also deeply looking into Stoicism and  mindfulness to keep my head at bay.

We got super close after her divorce even had something sexual for a time after. She would call and text me all the time, call me venting about life and I’d just listen. This went on for almost a year, we became extremely close spent most weekends together and she would always either ask to hangout, or be down to do something. Recently over the last month things have changed. In June she found out that her ex husband had moved on and found a new girlfriend. She called me crying and wanting to hurt herself. I talked her out of it and went over cuddled her until she fell asleep and then I left. Since then she has started changing, she seems annoyed to be around me, if I ask what’s wrong she flips out, she’s kicked me out of her house twice for trying to hold her while she’s upset.

I asked why she kept it a secret she said she didn’t want to lose me. She then admitted that two weeks after seeing the exs new girlfriend she started talking to a guy she met on a site. They in just a month they are talking all day, have been on 8 dates, FaceTime at least three times a week, and they are going on weekend away trips. She’s rescheduling her kids and other friends to make sure she can squeeze him in, all while complaining she has not time for anything. I told her therapy is something to look into.

What is wise mind in DBT?,1694598361.0,"Have you ever snapped at someone and surprised yourself with how harsh you sounded?

You may have thought, *whoa… where did that come from?!*

You were probably acting from what’s called “Emotion Mind” in DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy). DBT is a therapy methodology developed by Marsha Linehan which helps people feel more in control of their thoughts, feelings, and relationships.

When in emotion mind, people react based on their mood, without taking logic into account.

**You May Be in Emotion Mind If:**

* You’re reacting quickly, without thinking things through
* You’re acting on urges without taking into account your long-term goals
* You’re behaving impulsively and aren’t considering potential consequences of your actions
* You want to hurt who hurt you, even if you’re not typically a vengeful person
* You’re not considering anyone else’s feelings or additional context of the situation

On the other end of the spectrum is Reasonable Mind, which is rational, logical and steady.

You might be thinking, *okay, reasonable and rational, that sounds good! Being in Reasonable Mind all the time must be the goal, right?*

Actually, no! Being in Reasonable Mind all the time isn’t ideal, either. 

**You May Be in Reasonable Mind If:**

* You feel cut off from, or “numb” to your emotions
* You minimize or shrug off your feelings
* You rationalize your own or others’ behavior, even behavior that is unacceptable
* You are avoiding or in denial about something that is happening
* You are completely focused on a task

When we’re in Reasonable Mind, we’re cut off from our emotions. It’s important to be aware of and feel our emotions. First, because it’s an essential part of the human experience. More importantly, emotions contain very important information we need to understand our needs and boundaries.

Here’s an example of why awareness of emotions is important. Let’s say you feel angry and irritable every time you see your friend. Reasonable mind might say you’re being irrational and dismiss the feelings. But chances are there’s a good reason why you’re feeling angry at them, especially since it keeps happening.

Maybe they’re putting you down a lot, or not listening to what you’re saying. Or maybe you feel jealous of them. Finding the answer to why you’re angry is important to figuring out how to resolve your anger, whether you do so on your own or with the other person.

There are a number of potential reasons why people have difficulty being in Wise Mind. Maybe they haven’t had many people in their life model what it looks like to be in Wise Mind. Maybe staying in Reasonable Mind has protected them from extreme traumatic reactions. Maybe acting from Emotion Mind has gotten their needs met, for better or worse.

When you’re able to acknowledge your feelings without acting impulsively on them, you’re in Wise Mind.

**You May Be in Wise Mind If:**

* You’re taking both your emotions and logic into account
* You can name and feel your emotions
* You’re considering different ways to proceed before acting
* You can see the situation from multiple perspectives
* It feels like *you* are in control, not your mood

If you’re rarely in Wise Mind, don’t worry! You can increase your Wise Mind skills with practice.

**Ways to Cultivate Wise Mind Skills**

* Pause throughout the day and ask yourself which state of mind you are in.
* If you are in Emotion Mind, label which emotions you’re feeling.
* Using coping skills before acting on your feelings (for instance, journal, go on a walk, or take a hot shower).
* If you want to engage in a behavior that’s impulsive or mood-based (for example, emotional eating, texting your ex, substance abuse, etc.)
   * Delay the behavior by 1 hour
   * Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or peer before engaging in the behavior
   * Consider the negative consequences of the behavior
   * Replace the behavior with something less harmful (for example, drawing on your arms with a Sharpie instead of self-harming)
* Participate in a DBT program in your area. It can help you develop not only Wise Mind skills, but also, a wide variety of other skills related to Mindfulness, Emotion Regulation, Distress Tolerance, and Interpersonal Relationships.
* Practice yoga, Tai-Chi, or other physical activities that help you get in touch with your body. These can also help you develop more awareness of yourself and your emotions.
* Talk to a therapist! A therapist can help you stay accountable as you work towards strengthening your Wise Mind.

I have sex repulsion that’s been spreading even to being repulsed by romantic relationships after a traumatic breakup,1694539245.0,"I was/am deeply in love with my first love. We’ve been broken up for almost a year now. I idealized them so much and they felt like a god to me at times. I’m demisexual so they were the first person I felt comfortably sexual with (all online, we never met in person thankfully) and I really felt like I gave myself to them and I would tell them that. They had a porn addiction and would cheat on me online and hide it from me, which led to huge suicidal breakdowns. I felt really violated and degraded from it but I couldn’t leave them. I have bad jealousy and passiveness issues to begin with and this fueled them, causing intrusive thoughts (I have a lot of pure ocd symptoms) and worsened my sex repulsion so much. They broke up with me but wanted to stay in contact as friends but they led me on that we’d get back together again (not on purpose). Months later I find out they are in their first in person relationship with someone and was hiding it from me bc they were scared of how I’d react bc of my bpd. I blocked them on everything after this. I now have this repulsion/phobia of romantic relationships. It makes me not want to see/talk to people in relationships. It’s just so triggering and causes jealousy and intrusive thoughts of my ex with their current partner. I feel so ashamed and pathetic from this. I feel scared and uncomfortable with people who have sex. I can’t even talk to my current DBT therapist about this partly bc she’s married. I’ve told her about my sex repulsion a bit. I don’t know how to fix this but I hate it and want to think normally. I’m on Prozac and am slowly increasing to 80mg which is the dosage for OCD. I want to try EMDR when I graduate DBT.

vent tw,1694424213.0,"


hi i don’t want to trigger anyone so that’s why i put the nsfw im just gonna put the disclaimer here in the beginning with a tw for SA, suicide, drugs, self harm, death, ED, gun violence, and abuse. pls don’t continue reading if you know these are triggers for you <3 

i genuinely don’t know what to write about or how to start. it’s almost 2 in the morning, I have work tomorrow and I’m feeling so empty. the empty nothingness that always stays but also simultaneously comes and goes ? it’s hitting really hard right now. it always comes back and it always kills me but i welcome it. i hate it yet want it to stay because it’s comforting. i don’t know life without it. i feel everything to the deepest depths of where any emotion can go and then even further still. but then at times all emotion stops and i feel nothing. most days lately i’ve been feeling nothing, i’m distracting myself with work, with tv, with my phone just waiting for the time to pass. i need to distract myself so i don’t get sucked into the empty and end it. 

a little context i’m almost 20, i’m chronically suicidal, also have PTSD, anorexia, MDD, and anxiety. i’m a trans guy, i’m an addict. i have been sober for a while now in terms of hard drugs but relapsed more recently with weed (multiple times) due to the nature of my addiction as well as grief and bpd self destruction / impulse. i lost a friend i met in the psych ward a few months ago now and that has sent me spiraling ever since. we can call her J.

going further back before J died, a little bit over a year ago i had lost another friend who overdosed on fentanyl (we can call them A) this was one of the drugs i was abusing during the pits of my addiction. this came as a chain of deaths for me. 

two weeks before A passed, there was actually another kid i had known since elementary school who overdosed and died the same way as A. and before these most recent three, incredibly heavy deaths there was also freshmen year when two kids -I did not know- passed away in my community from being shot to death at school, a school many of my friends went to. anyway, i have not been well dealing with grief. 

it’s scary, i’m constantly paranoid because death has evidently been getting closer and closer for years and i’m terrified that next it’s going to be one of my best friends or fps.  grief has been making my bpd symptoms so much worse in so many ways and i can’t even really begin to describe how painful it has all been. it’s harder because i’m genuinely trying to recover for once in my life. i have not had a suicide attempt in two years, i have finally stopped using, i have made huge progress in relapses with my ed and sh, i am not being hospitalized or sent to residential repeatedly, i’m in a relationship with someone healthy and good for me who isn’t abusive, stuff like that. it’s driving me absolutely insane. i CRAVE chaos and instability more than anything else. i need it or i can’t function. i have to cope with all of this death sober and not reverting to old behaviors. i have to at least try or i don’t think i will survive. either i die or i end up in a hospital again. genuinely, these are my options. 

i guess i’m just venting because i haven’t allowed myself to do so in a while. grief has made me isolate myself more than i ever imagined possible. i don’t feel safe to really talk about all of this anywhere. i have shut down and compartmentalized death so i don’t feel it all the time and it’s almost like i have turned it off so well so that way I can work and “function” that i sometimes don’t feel it at all even when i want to. more context i guess i graduated highschool and ever since then i have been working nonstop saving up to escape my abusive parents. i’m not going to college yet because it’s too overwhelming to think about but im not making enough money to leave so im just trapped. im trapped in all the shit and i can’t get out and i never can. the all or nothing mentality is usually something i can recognize and cope with but it is becoming so fucking bad i don’t even know what is real or what isn’t. i’m unsure if i can ever get out of here unsure if i can live or if my partner stopped loving me because of a certain tone. i believe i am inherently worthless and made for others to use and take advantage of, then discard.

i am used to being used lol. used to being r ped used to being gaslit and lied to and manipulated for others overall benefit. i did not think i would make it this long, i had been planning my death for most of my life. being past 18 is surreal to me. and it hurts even more because all of these deaths? they were just kids. J was a few months shy of 17. A was 17. Before them, 17, 15, 14. children. my first attempt was at 14 and i don’t understand why it wasn’t me. survivors guilt is terrible but when you have “quiet” bpd (most of the time anyway) and you’ve already internalized the belief that everything is inherently your fault it makes it a million times worse. 

i want to kill myself every day, i think about it every fucking day. i want to be with J. I miss her. I want to go back to the fucking hospital. I miss the psych ward so much sometimes it hurts. Not because it’s a nice place to be but because that’s where I could escape my house.

i have adult responsibilities now, i have a job, i have a license, i have goals i want to reach, but it’s all been stunted somehow because i have never been able to truly live my life without planning when it would end. i’m tired of being this way, and feeling this way. and i know i will feel it forever. or maybe that’s just the b&w thinking but i know regardless that this is a lifelong battle. 

i want things to get better, i want to survive. i want my friends to survive. i want to live and i want my friends to live. i don’t see the point in living if i have no one left by the end of my life. i don’t see the point in living if it’s me who makes it and not these kids that had their lives cut short and taken from them. it should have been me and i deal with this belief and overwhelming guilt every day. i miss them every day. i have been a terrible boyfriend to the love of my life. i have pushed him away and said nasty things to him, i’ve let the rage take over and i have viewed him as absolutely nothing at times in order to protect myself. this is not something i can just simply blame on bpd, i’m trying to actively take accountability and acknowledge these things and work towards recovery. but it’s fucking hard, especially with all the grief. it just feels like my recovery has been meaningless up to this point and absolutely nothing matters anymore bec we are all going to die and i’ll probably give up one day and impulsively decide to go and join them. part of me lashes out because i want to protect him from myself. i want him to leave and abandon me like everyone else does so he doesn’t get hurt. i hurt him so i don’t have to hurt him when i die.

I feel like my fp has ruined everything for me.,1694308335.0,"I’m autistic as well as having bpd, so not only am I emotionally dependent, but extremely naive. I assume that people have pure intentions and make mistakes, just like me. This is taken advantage of. A lot. Especially by my Favorite Person.

Whenever they (my fp) decide they don’t want me anymore, they become an emotionally abusive asshole, and I don’t understand it. How could someone I adored so much do that to me? It’s soul crushing. I’m so tired of remembering what they did to me over and over, and just crying. 

It hurts so much. I’m tired. I think somehow it’s my trauma repeating itself, since it’s always been being disposed of and abused when I’m not perfect anymore

It’s ruined my life, honestly. My self image, my healing, my relationships. I’m so tired.

I wish that I was strong enough to be able to let this person go. Even if I can’t really do that; to get to the point where I know I would not let this person back even if I could. I don’t think I can. Through everything I’ve been resilient to, it’s the one thing I can’t seem to do. 

It feels like no matter what happens, deep down I still belong to this person. I don’t feel real unless I’m being loved.

I don’t react anymore. I have issues with the way bpd criteria is written, but I don’t meet it anymore. But no matter what, this is the one thing that won’t go away. How am I supposed to heal from that?

Edit: I feel like I went off track with what I actually wanted to say. The way my fp was mistreated me had really stunted my healing, as well as ruining relationships for me to make that worse. I left an online support group since people were annoyed that I talked about my FP too much. I had to cut off 2 of my closest friends recently since one of them still wanted contact with him.

I’ve been in CBT with some DBT features for like a year and a half and I made huge strides! But now I moved, and am starting DBT group and a one on one CBT therapist in my new city in two weeks.

I haven’t started the new therapies yet - but my friend who is a psychologist sent me a packet of DBT worksheets for my time off therapy and holy WOW - they are effective.

Personally, they take a long ass time for me to fill out, and I only feel like they work for me because a.) I already have experience with doing logs like this and with cognitive distortions and schemas through my time in CBT, and b.) I already have worked on emotional awareness a lot for several years with several therapists.

But like - this morning my partner said something innocuous of course which scared the shit out of me and immediately felt anxious and scared and angry and confused and I wanted to ask him all these questions and interrogate him and do all my impulsive behaviors…

But then I filled out “check the facts” and wow. It just wild. It took probably an hour for me to really work through it, but I can see SO clearly exactly the route my mind took, and why, and I feel empathetic with myself, and I feel like I understand my partner, and I feel safe and happy and understood and I took no actions that I regret and just…wow.

something I’ve noticed with pwbpd/ the bpd community,1693695061.0,"I’ve got the most invalidation from other people with bpd. 

Things I’ve been told on bpd subreddits (tw ableism against us):

 - “No one wants to hear about your mental illness”

 - “You hurt yourself for attention and pity”

 - “Saying [my abuser] caused your self harm is proof that you’re unstable”

 - “You should ignore pwbpd while they’re in extreme distress and not listen to their pleads for help”

 - equating basic symptoms of bpd to abuse and bad behavior 

 - when I said my ex (partner at the time) would ignore me in distress or make me feel worse/ like a burden every time, they told me that i should accept that and reinforced that I was a burden

Definitely not everything, and this was all from one online space that is specifically **for us** too. Honestly, being labeled with bpd has been absolutely awful for my mental health. I got a trauma disorder from being made to feel like a burden for existing and then got made to feel like a burden for existing with the disorder. The stigma just reinforces our insecurities

As well as this, recently I had to remove two of my closest friends from my life, who both which have bpd. My “friend” was validating my trauma from my emotionally abusive FP, and was telling me to let go, because it was “sad” that she had to cut contact with my abuser

I have a theory that people with bpd are constantly told by others, society as a whole and even therapy that our emotions are irrational. They are the problems that need to be fixed. So when we are victims, and we are many times over more likely to be victims due to the way bpd functions, we are always the problem. I hope that makes sense

Has anyone ever taken the DES assessment while receiving therapy?,1693350906.0,"Recently, I’ve experienced a severe mental breakdown - to cut a long story short, the experience resulted in several hospitalisations and taking time off work for 2 and a half month to the present date.   

The aftermath of this was me receiving a care coordinator and psychologist, who have decided that given my recent experiences, they want to do an ‘extended assessment’ to clarify my diagnosis. I have been diagnosed with BPD for close to 3 years now and when initially diagnosed, I did not have to take the DES assessment.  

DES stands for Dissociative Experiences Scale, which is essentially a test of 28 questions relating to dissociative tendencies that you rate between 0-100% based on the regularity of your experience with the posed scenario.   

This is not anything I have ever been asked to do before, and I am unsure if this is a typical part of a BPD diagnosis. I have made peace with my diagnosis and being presented with the DES has sky rocketed my anxiety that it might not have been right all along.   

The last thing I want to do is send myself down the rabbit hole by googling to try and find any form of clarity on this, and I would be immensely grateful if anyone could shed any input on this or if they have any experience (personal or not) with the DES assessment.

turning 25 really made me realize how narcissistic my parents are,1693340841.0,"a little background for context: My whole life was spent in survival mode as I was systematically denied opportunities to grow into a healthy, happy, functional person. As the youngest in my family, for the longest time, I was told I was sick and to blame for my family's dysfunction. time after time my parents have proven to want me off their payroll and never showed genuine compassion, empathy, or support in any other way except financially. They would say cruel, horrible, hurtful things to bring me down but say they want the best for me and pull a woe-is-me card saying they have done everything they can to help. I softened and repeated to them that all I ever wanted was a cheerleader but instead, they'd continuously drag and slander me telling me I'd never get far in life and the world is a cruel place. the truth is they are the cruelest thing I have encountered in my lifetime. No matter what I did, even after 15+ years of therapy  I found my identity, improved myself, learned how to not react like them, communicated in a healthy manner, and am very confident and can defend myself properly.  it was never enough to change how they treated me. At 17 they sent me to a residential therapy center and I was in a position in which I couldn't decline or avoid it, which actually ended up saving me and changing my life forever. They were supposed to be a part of the journey but even experts couldn't convince them of their wrongdoings and who I really was, not who they interpreted me to be. They refused to listen to my therapists and tried to convince them of things they simply knew weren't true. (I lived there and interacted with them on a daily basis for a year). Eventually, it got to the point where my parents were constantly contacting my therapists, writing a literal \*book\* worth of an email, trying to tell them what to tell me or what I was doing. They wouldn't respect a professional's boundaries, how were they ever going to respect mine? hindsight is 20/20 as they spent my tuition to go to my dream college and pursue my dream job on this place. Grand total of $120,000+, to not listen to anything that was truly causing conflict. This problem persisted with all different therapists for years, looking back, they basically had me hop to different therapists throughout the years when thought they were wrong and couldn't sway them. When I was a kid I distinctly remember an incident where a therapist had restated something my mother had said to me recently, and i asked her if my mom told you to say that to which she replied, you're a smart cookie. They were convinced i would never take off and told me id never succeed yet resented me for being the reason I couldnt.

&#x200B;

Now, 25 (F), I live on my own and I have my dream job and found my dream apartment. I admit I had a late takeoff but everyone is on their own timeline, progress not perfection. They had helped me along the way financially but were consistent in their past behavior. I'm currently in the process of a move and things that shouldn't be arguments become arguments because they think I'm arguing when I'm cool as a cucumber. I did everything myself and orchestrated the move. I made plans and shared them and how we needed to get things done. they'd constantly interrogate me as if I hadn't recited the plan 10 times in a way that made me feel that they think I'm truly incapable. yet, they pushed me off when I reached out to get things done and would get so mad when id point it out respectfully and they'd blow me off while going off on me repeating the same horrible things. I know they are helping me financially but expressing my frustrations led to me being told I'm never going to have a relationship or friends and this is why people hate me and leave. to which I replied, like who? then they claim I gaslight them as they continue to try to tell me I'm this horrible person who lives to make them miserable. They go back and forth constantly from wanting to help to being punishing mean-spirited people and I'm just tired. I want to enjoy my life and I see now that even achieving what they thought I'd never do but claimed they wanted for me still isn't enough to earn their respect. I've done so much mourning over them never being the parents i needed through the years and now I just think my only option is to surrender to that. Its just really sad. I have so much anger and resentment from it, especially when I was the one told in my childhood that they had to walk on eggshells. But now I see, it was me that had to tip-toe and hold my breath. I don't want to be angry anymore, but god, do they fill me with rage. 

I don't know what I'm really looking for...  I want to preserve my identity and my recovery without their words living in my head. So maybe connection, advice, or a community. I just want to be happy and feel proud, my life has never been better and I feel like they have sucked the joy right out of my achievements. every. single. time.",KirbyInTheClouds,,False,164tdo4,6,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/164tdo4/turning_25_really_made_me_realize_how/
How can I get over my bf telling people about my BPD,1693328365.0,"In the beginning of our relationship I found out my bf had been talking to his friend about my mental friend and that he had admitted that I have BPD. I barely knew his friend at that point. I then also found out he had talked to his parents about my diagnosis without my consent. I’m terrified of people knowing this part of me, I barely even tell my friends, so having strangers get this as their first impression of me without even getting to know me was incrediably painful. 

This honestly made me lose so much trust in him. It’s almost been a year and I still can’t let it go. Just knowing that the friend knows this about me pushed me away from him and I refused to get to know him, and now he doesn’t like me and I have a feeling it’s partly because he has this idea that I’m crazy because of my BPD.

Distortions that Keep BPD in Place (my DBT workbook answers),1693197309.0," *The worksheets I answered are available on*[ ***Dr. Fox's website.*** ](https://drdfox.com/worksheets/)

Chapter 16: DISTORTIONS THAT KEEP BPD IN PLACE 

*distortion: twisting or changing*

**My BPD lens causes me** to see myself as someone with not much to offer, so I have to show off what I know and think of ways to be useful to someone, so that they'll keep me around. I feel like no one really wants me around just for the company, and I’d have to be doing something. ""useful"" or ""fun"", with them. I don't like myself, so when life makes it hard to maintain relationships and people let me go, I blame myself for being uninteresting, or I blame them for hurting me, and ascribe bad motives to them.

When I think of \[\], I think that can't survive without her because I can't make a living on my own. My BPD lens causes me to see and think that I have to put up with her abuse, and get satisfaction in continuing to take advantage of her financially by dwelling on her abuse.

When I think of times that \[they\] abuse me, my BPD causes me to see and think that I deserve this life because I can’t achieve any better. 

**If, based on my BPD lens, I see or believe** that people are hurting and abusing me on purpose,

**Then** I feel justified in hating them and/ or taking advantage of them in some ways, or turn this anger inward and hate myself for bringing this treatment upon myself.

**The benefit of doing this** is that I get to have someone to blame for life being hard, and I don’t have to acknowledge the fact that sometimes there are no answers for the things that people do or things that happen. Also, if I hate myself for something that’s vague and seems unchangeable like “being weird” then I can focus on that instead of working to change the things that I can change; i.e., if I am doomed, I can stop trying. 

**If I'm using my authentic view,** I feel peaceful and safe. My mind pictures images of nature, trees swaying in the wind and white clouds in an endless blue sky. I feel so happy. I'm enough. I feel loved by myself. 

**If I do this,**  I feel that I reach a starting point to go forward into the future without the sorrows of the past dragging me down. I have more than enough love to share.",,,False,163c9cp,8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/163c9cp/distortions_that_keep_bpd_in_place_my_dbt/

A question about bpd and favorite person,1693022295.0,"I have a question about favorite persons, more specifically my therapist

So I have not been medically diagnosed with BPD but I have GAD, OCD, autism, and depression and all of which have made things very hard. 

Recently I’ve been struggling with some very complex emotions and mental struggle including obsessive thoughts about my therapist. How every it feels slightly different to ocd. I get these thoughts where I over analyze and find a problem with the things she does (wears, behaviors, etc.) it has caused me to feel like a horrible person. And no matter how much cognitive reframing I do it won’t stop. My brain won’t listen to any logic or rationale. I end up checking her Facebook and pretty much every other thing online of her multiple times a day. I feel as if I NEED to know more about her. Sometimes I just have this feeling like somethings off and I relate it to her. And over all it makes me feel like a creep and a horrible person. Especially since she is basically the sweetest person I know, and has helped me so much, and always been there for me

I though originally this may have been more tied to my OCD, but after doing some research I think I may need to ask my psychiatrist about bpd. I thought I would come to this sub and maybe seek some help. Does this sound like what a favorite person is like.

During my time off, I read the book This is Not the End. It’s a bunch of BPD essays; some I related to, some I didn’t. Most of the people in the book were diagnosed in their teens, 20s and a few in their 30s.  I don’t think anyone was diagnosed in their 40s. I know this diagnosis is gaining traction (right?) and I want to understand it better before it gets the TikTok treatment. Are there others here who were diagnosed in their 40s?

How to train yourself to not be afraid of being alone or needing someone,1692635938.0,"Idk how to do it.

My anxiety is through the roof just thinking about being alone.

I’ve had a hard time surviving by myself. I am a gentle and soft person by nature. I’m not very confrontational. I avoid conflict because it’s stressful.

I have also struggled with holding jobs for a long time and have some work related trauma too.

I’m in an abusive and neglectful situationship with a misogynistic red pill sort of guy who hasn’t been honest from the beginning of our relationship.

He’s very disrespectful and disregards me and stonewalls me all the time. It’s not a relationship where we can have respectful communication because he just wants to be right all the time.

BPD or not, this guy clearly isn’t okay either and has his own dysfunction.

TL;DR I understand that my relationship is shit and I need to get out cuz it’s bad for me, even with BPD but how do I become strong enough to do that?

I’m terrified of being alone. There’s many layers to that fear, the main one being financial.

This economy is hard as hell. I wonder how many others are trapped in bad relationships because of financial reasons.

Like many of you, I also don’t have reliable family members or a supportive community to help me if this relationship goes bust.

I have BPD and CPSTD etc BECAUSE of my parents.

Siblings can’t even help themselves.

I feel TRAPPED. I don’t want to want anyone. I don’t want to NEED anyone.

I just want to make enough money and live an extremely simplistic life and if I DO find a partner I’d like someone with integrity and a desire to be a good partner.

So i started counting things - objects, trees, tiles on the floor - literally anything. I started noticing patterns in the world and stores and suddenly... colors got brighter. My mind got quiet. Sounds got louder. Everything got clearer.  
I understand counting is a tool for distraction (DBT ACCEPTS accronym) but Imo its an absolutely incredible grounding / mindfulness tool. I felt alive. I still feel alive. I feel like a little boy again - everything around me is fucking amazing. I'm amazed by everything right now. I haven't felt like this since I was high on marijuana.  
This works so well for me - I can focus on evolving myself in the present moment; nurturing my inner child and emotionally developing. How can I do that if I'm not present? I just need to keep counting. If I'm present, I'll hurt people less because I'll focus on what I'm doing and saying. I'll be able to be a better person. I'm really excited right now.

Work/school accommodations,1692167957.0,"I met with my supervisor at work today, and they gave me some notes of things to work on. Most of it comes down to extreme levels of dissociation (appearing disengaged, forgetting things, and taking more breaks than I probably should). I’m grateful to work in an awesome office environment that’s very trauma informed, so I know they mean it when they ask me if there’s any accommodations we can make to help me function better in my role. 

So this is my question. What accommodations have you found helpful at work or school? I also go back to school in about a month, so it’s been on my mind but I’m mostly drawing a blank.",Wilted-Dazies,,False,15shv3b,7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15shv3b/workschool_accommodations/
dissociation,1692145224.0,"This ones such a difficult symptom to explain of BPD but it is one that I think might impact me the most, and actually largely contribute to my other symptoms.I do not feel like a real person. I do not feel like other people are real. It feels like I am constantly the main character of a movie, but not in a narcissistic way. More like... I'm just witnessing my life play out like a film. Whatever happens in it. I monologue my life to myself, what I have said and will say, CONSTANTLY. I think my senses are dulled, if not completely gone sometimes. There's times where I barely taste or notice the food I'm eating, or what I'm hearing, because I'm too stuck in my own mind.For a lot of people with disassociation disorders, they have phases of it. They can still ground to reality quite easily, or at least manage it, to my knowledge. (I may be wrong.)But for me... it is my norm. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; though severity may vary. At my most severe, I will make extremely stupid and impulsive decisions. I've even told people I don't believe they are real. I've told MINORS that. It's fucked up, I've probably traumatized them for a very long time.But I'm not saying this because I'm out of hope. I know there is hope - and it is mindfulness and grounding techniques.DBT has been tremendously helpful for this. Somehow staring at an object for 5 minutes, or moving my eyes back and forth rapidly, grounds me. Telling myself ""in this moment, I have everything I need"" grounds me. But usually... it only lasts a few seconds, or a few minutes.

However the other night I made a breakthrough. I had a five to ten minute period where I was just AWARE. Everything around me was amazing. The dust on my air conditioner, the detail on one of my moms outside decorations, the taste of my cherry and apple sauce... Holy shit. I can still imagine the taste, almost. It was absolutely insane. It was a lot like my favorite scene in my favorite movie, It's such a beautiful day, which can be seen here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4fOaTXeqCw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4fOaTXeqCw)

But getting there... That was hard. I feel this strange feeling as I try to approach it. It's almost like... fear. This deep, deep fear. I think I might be horrified to live in the moment. The present is actually scary. If I'm in it too long, I start thinking about how I'll die someday, because suddenly I'm attached to my life like it's a parental figure, and I don't want to lose it. Before I can tell myself ""you have to make the most of it now! It'll be okay."" I've lost it and I'm disassociating again.

This disassociation has impacted my life in extreme ways. My memory is extremely fragmented. I barely remember anything because I wasn't fucking THERE. I was GONE. In my own head, spiraling. I say stupid shit. I do stupid shit. I hurt people then I'm not even able to remember it.

I think if I was able to associate constantly, my BPD symptoms would lessen. It'd be easier to think about what I was going to say, and take action.

Weed helped. A lot. But then the paranoia kicked in... I quit. The friends who'd come to know me as my best self (the high self) eventually, a year later, learned about the real me. The broken inner child with BPD.

I know I have to keep practicing. Someday, in a year or two, it'll be easier. I'll LIVE and EXPERIENCE life. But god, it's kinda horrifying and hard. But I spent hours doing it today, fighting my brain to focus on the moment, breathing, listening, paying attention to the little details like the drops of water rolling down the window, focusing on what my uncle was saying, counting the amount of wood planks in a gazebo. And I'll never give up. I want to get better. I have a lot of other areas to work on, too, but this is a big factor.

Feeling healthier,1692141475.0,I had a hard (9month) relationship and breakup about 10 months ago and it made me realize that I had BPD and that I needed to fix it cause i was suffering and it wasn’t the first time I had felt this way. Past relationships weren’t as bad but I was definitely having BPD symptoms throughout my life. This relationship was just a lot more emotional and deep. Recently we have gotten back in touch and some feelings of anxiety and stress still arise but NOTHING compared to what I had before. I’m able to accept their hesitation ever after we’ve discussed possibly giving things a second chance. Where before I was clinging onto them because I couldn’t handle them being away or not wanting me. I don’t even get (totally) upset when they don’t text me back for hours. I’m just feeling very proud of this growth and wanted to share that it’s possible to be in control of these emotions. Everyday is different and some days are harder than others but it is possible.

BPDlovedones…helpful or harmful. Idk who cares,1692082128.0,"I was inquiring information the past couple of days over personal experiences with borderline personality disorder from patients and loved ones. My research specialization is in neuropsychopharmacology, and I hopefully contribute to the development of genetic or pharmaceutical therapies that can target behavior and personality. I have BPD myself and studying it is the one way I could control it after growing up in trauma and chaos. I have a very loving bf who, despite everything, has never loved or supported me like anyone else has. He has his own issues and we get to figure things out about each other and learn how to communicate better every day. I am starting to realize that I need to talk to myself like I’m talking to a child sometimes. I tell him the same thing when he approaches me with problems. It’s all a learning process and it continuously changes every day. It is never boring however that’s for sure. I posted something in the BPlovedones seeking familial advice and got banned. I did not read the rules, because I don’t really know how to reddit works and it said, I violated the number one role of not being a BPD patient because of BPD abused users. So I’m sitting here reflecting on the psychology behind that. Everyone is allowed to have their own designated personal space away from their abusers. And certain mental illnesses, like alcoholism, hoarding, schizophrenia, and BPD can take extreme tolls on the people that care about the patients. But denying information access when it comes to public health, awareness, and advocacy, seems stigma fueling. To demonize everyone who has BPD, is definitely some thing that would trigger people with BPD, not help build the gap between those suffering and their loved ones. Which seems a little counter intuitive. Would you not want those hurting their family members to see forms of other loved ones sharing their experiences to hopefully gain some insight and change their behaviors? As someone with BPD, and talking to the people I care about, changing behaviors, regardless of mental illness is extremely difficult. My studies are in neurosciences and usually center around glutamate and consciousness. Personality disorders are extremely complex because they are personality based. It is hard to pinpoint exactly where in the brain, and what targets are appropriate for pharmaceutical intervention, because there are so many factors to consider. is changing personality almost like changing the conscious and subconscious? All consciousness is is our current decisions being made in response to memories and past interactions. Every interaction I have with people, I try to sit and reflect on. I think about my experiences, and I think about their experiences. I have had to teach myself and learn how to not take everything so personally. I feel like I’m trapped in the mind of a five year old as well trapped in the mind of 1000 year old person. I feel like I’ve lived 1000 lives and sometimes I’m not sure what’s real, what’s a delusion, and what is fact. This is why I love neuroscience and medicinal chemistry. It gives me explanations for why I am experiencing an emotion, why I am reacting to it, and to just remind myself that it’s not that big of a deal. I don’t want to make excuses for people who cannot take accountability of their actions however. I used to do that and thinking about it makes me ashamed. My mother has BPD and is closing in on 50. I have only repaired my relationship with her this year out of pity after cutting her off just as other people did. I understand how she does not see how her actions affect people, and that’s why the mental illness makes relationships difficult. She seems to think that she raised me perfectly fine even though sometimes I didn’t have food and we were homeless at one point and she constantly screamed in my face and hit me. She never hugged me. She never told me she loved me. I never felt like she was my mother. I don’t have a father. I don’t have siblings. I don’t have aunts and uncles. I grew up extremely lonely and the thing I struggle with the most as an adult is abandonment. I think I fear the way I felt as a child. I have had the thought “it will never get better” for as long as I can remember. And now I look around at the life I have created. With the person who I think is the love of my life, my wonderful friends and support systems, my education in pharmaceuticals and neuroscience, my ability to travel to different countries, and ability to have my own things. And yet there’s still a sense of chaos in my life and nothing can ever be stable. Am I doomed to live this way forever? All I want to do is fix this. And I don’t even know what “this” is. I fully support psychoactive compound therapy. From my readings of academic literature, and personal experiences, I think building neuroplasticity through psychoactive treatment is a key component to mental health rehabilitation. You obviously can’t just give people psychedelics and say go crazy—it needs to be monitored, and patients need directed therapy while they are experiencing altered states of consciousness. Becoming extremely emotional, and vulnerable has caused me so much grief, but has allowed me to discover so much about life and help me build extremely close personal relationships with people so I can learn more and give back to the field of neuropsychopharmacology.",pthevslayer,,False,15rku5z,14,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15rku5z/bpdlovedoneshelpful_or_harmful_idk_who_cares/

My BPD definitely plays a factor, sure; but I think partly it's because I haven't forgiven myself for the friendgroups before that one.  
Something clicked in me while I was doing DBT the other day. Something I'd heard over and over, but suddenly resonated with me.  
The past is in the past. I have to move on.  
The people I've hurt are away from me now. Free from the shackles of black and white thinking; building their own lives. I'm incredibly happy for them. I like to think that if I did ruin their lives like they said, that together, they'll come together stronger through that pain, and make lifelong bonds. I honestly think that is kind of beautiful.  
And me? Well, if I want to prevent hurting people like that again, I have to move on.  
I called myself a monster long before they called me one. It was a self fulfilling prophecy, really.  
I've accepted what I've done. I've acted in bad ways; there's no need to insult myself for it anymore. And now?

Do you guys feel genuine happiness - alone?,1691468264.0,"Looking for some positive stories here.  
I'm not feeling much of anything lately. Very empty, or pain. Practicing making peace with it. It's gotten a LOT easier to radically accept anything that comes my way- except that I should forgive myself, and deserve happiness. The guilt is too fresh to believe that.  
However I started that today too- told myself I forgive myself for 90 minutes straight today, until I had a headache. Had a really intense emotion hit me, and I was actually able to calm myself down! That's great! Progress. I can't wait to learn mindfulness techniques. Embracing my flaws has been helping, and it has been easier to accept I come off to others as a bad person.   
But I still don't know how I can feel happiness like I did again. I don't feel like I even deserve it. God, I don't know if this is just me, but when I have a friend group or lover- i go in 5000%. I FEEL 5000%. The emotion, the euphoria - I've done marijuana, and I thought that feeling was drug induced. It wasn't. The marijuana didn't make me that happy. The love I felt for others did.  
But ultimately, it's toxic, and always crashes down - and I end up hurting others badly.  
I want to hear some success stories about people finding genuine happiness - by themselves. Happiness that makes you feel not so lonely. That fills the void. Happiness that makes you feel that maybe you don't NEED an fp, or a friend group to fix you. That you just need... yourself.  
Because y'know, I'm a bad guy, and I think bad guys even can feel happiness sometimes. Maybe they can even become decent people, somewhere in the middle. That's all I can hope for.

Need advice for healthy connection cutting,1691442761.0,"I've come a LONG way with my BPD.   I've had a healthy relationship with a group of people for two years and ongoing now!  And now you're wondering what the titles for.

&#x200B;

Before I went to therapy, I found a group of people who helped support me after I had a falling out with an abusive friendgroup.  

They were incredibly healing for me, for a time.  I have done nothing to hurt them, and the majority of conflicts were things we talked over.

&#x200B;

I say majority, for a reason.  Because they...started to become cold at one point, started to revoke a lot of comfort they offered me, and stopped wanting to tell me about themselves.  I've recently discovered they've destroyed some things we've made together when I wasn't looking, to. 

And i've found out they treated one of my current healthy friends like absolute shit, and talking to them, i've discovered these people aren't nearly as healthy as they claim to be. 

&#x200B;

I do not think they're healthy for me, and the best option would just...be to cut them out. 

&#x200B;

But I have my pains.

They've changed my life, they bought me birthday presents, they've helped me more times than I can count, and there's still a lot of things I love, and like about them.  And cutting is so....painful.  I'm crying even thinking about it. 

The easiest thing for me to do is to ghost them, but the guilt of it would haunt me forever.   I think the best way to do this would be to thank them for everything, apologize I couldn't make everything up back, but tell them, ultimately...

It's just not healthy for me anymore.  And I want to focus on my health and recovery, I want to tell them to focus on theirs to (one of the them suffers from extreme anxiety with abandonment issues).

It's painful, I don't even know how to BEGIN processing how to...recover from that, all over again, or even begin to work up my courage.

The only thing that comes in my mind is trying to kill myself but obviously that doesn’t make a difference in the path of changing. I dont know what to do anymore, i dont see my psychologist because of money issues.

A lesson in splitting and honoring your needs,1691170421.0,"Hey guys so I learned a big lesson this week on BPD and on speaking my own boundaries.

Long story short my parents died about 5 months ago and it sent me into the worst regression of my symptoms I have ever had.

I’ve spent the past five months clinging to my bf like a leech and having crisis after crisis over tiny things like him seeing friends or turning over in bed wrong (he’s rejecting me in his sleep?!? Spoiler: he wasn’t. He was sleeping)

Long story short - things have gotten better slowly over the past few months. I’ve gone from being constantly terrified to being mostly regulated. However - he had a few big trips coming up at the end of the summer that were giant triggers for me.

I spent the past month preparing for his trip with my therapist and it was going pretty smoothly! I wasn’t jealous, I was even able to relax and have fun on my own. Was having lots of bad thoughts come up but was dealing with them well without needing any outside help, and he was staying in more contact than usual knowing that this was a big challenge for me.

While on his trip he brought up that he wanted to do some psychedelics on the last night of his trip and I got triggered SO hard upon even hearing about it. (Parents were terrible addicts who abused me under the influence). 

What ended up happening is I kind of felt guilted to let him do it even though I was extremely uncomfortable with it. I felt really guilty from being so clingy the past few months and from having a major meltdown/splitting episode when he was at a party in early July. I felt like I HAD to agree otherwise I was terrible and controlling. He also mentioned he had abstained multiple times over the past several months because I was in such a state of arousal, he knew it wouldn’t go over well. This just added to my guilt and shame.

He ended up doing it and guess what happened? I had a meltdown and split the hardest I ever have.

And now that we are through it I realized that it just shouldn’t have happened. 

Because even though I cried and cried about it and talked to him and my therapist about it, I was still extremely uncomfortable the day of. But we pushed through and it went really fucking badly.

And the thing is: I’m not against drug use. I know that my normal self had handled it fine in the past, but right now I’m extra sensitive. But instead of honoring my needs, and just telling him: hey, I’m not ready for this right now, I can’t handle it well right now - I instead felt the episode coming on and cried and cried and felt terrified but let him do it anyway. What happened next makes sense: the emotions built up and exploded on him after a few hours.

And I think the lesson here is: I should have just said ‘no’. 

But instead of noticing my symptoms and how triggered I was - I let the shame of my past actions and the fear of abandonment control me (he won’t love me if I say no). 

But looking back - I deserve someone who will understand that I’m not ready. And at the end of they day, I’m the only person who can know my own boundaries. Tbh - if I had just said straight up: “I’m not ready for this right now, I’m not stopping you forever, I just need some time”, I think he would have been really understanding and accommodating.

If he had just waited, and I spent a few weeks talking to my therapist and him about it - he probably would have been able to go back to doing his usual usage without a giant problem. But instead he was impatient, and I was shaming myself for my feelings - and it led to something really bad.

I think we can let the shame of our BPD control us. Thinking: ‘I should be better than this. I should be able to control this.’

But what if instead we view it through the lens of self love and acceptance of our BPD? 

“This is really difficult for me, and knowing how I am and how I react to triggers, I’ll probably have an episode if this continues.”

I think maybe working together with your partner, realizing that you’re a work in progress, and giving yourself TIME to learn how to cope healthily before exposure is the way to go if you can swing it. It’s ok to need time to adjust and to take time to heal and prepare for big triggers. Don’t shame yourself and jump in, because you’ll both end up feeling worse than if you had just waited. Speaking your boundaries will protect your relationship!

If you’re building a house together, and you really want to put up a roof, you need to build the walls first, instead of just throwing up a roof without proper support. Because then you’re left with the mess and expense of a broken roof to deal with, instead of just doing it right the first time.",Astrnougat,,False,15i6e7x,8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15i6e7x/a_lesson_in_splitting_and_honoring_your_needs/
Going through a breakup,1691158407.0,"I spent a LOT of time focusing on myself afyer getting out of an abusive relationship a few years back. I spent time alone finding hobbies and working on so many of my own issues as well as coping with what happened during that relationship. I ended up getting clean from self harm and I even went back and graduated high school and started working again. I was so proud of myself and thought I could handle a relationship again finally. 

I may have been wrong.

We moved really slow at first, we took our time with dates and spending the night. We didn't want to force anything and I didn't want to get addicted so fast. Things went really well until around the 3 month mark I had a bad week, I was crying a lot and upset and for the first time, I brought up how when I feel like a mess I want to selfharm. I thought he would be able ro handle it since after a while of dating I told him about BPD and he read up on it and even highlighted and annotated a book about it, just to study and better handle what could happen. But he did not handle the stress well when I break down did come, he tried to leave but ended up wanting to stay, and I felt good about his choice at first since I did not beg or freak out when he brought it up, I tried to just talk about our issues. However trying to leave 3 months in really set something off in me, immediately I sowed seeds of abandonment and left me paranoid. 

As time went on I still had breakdowns over something dumb every few months, but when he'd bring up something to me that upset him or hurt him, I'd always take the steps to start changing, and more often than not I'd stop the bad behavior he pointed out. I was lucky of he pointed it out though, he had a fear of confrontation and as he told me ""I didn't make it easy for him."" I know it should be easier for me to see what I'm doing wrong but sometimes it was hard, I told him he'd need to spell it out for me, and there's times I'd get really defensive and mad when he did. I'd always apologize afyer the fact and tell him I overreacted and that he's in the right to feel that way. I ALWAYS made sure to tell him his feelings were valid and good and I tried my best to take accountability, even of he had to point out my wrongdoings. 

Though I'd have these bad times, I will say I didn't insult him, I never uses shoes like or SH as a threat and I'd take accountability for myself feeling like that, when he was upset with me I'd even be sure to avoid talking about those feelings so he wouldn't associate them with his own emotions towards me. 

But eventually he tried to leave again, showing me no warnings and coming home and breaking the news to me a year into the relationship. I yet again, just sat there and tried to talk about it and we worked though things... only for him to do it again the next day and decide to stay AGAIN. At that point I was horrified. Always scared he's going to go and not knowing when it would happen. He wouldn't talk to me about any issues he had when they came up. He would give me the chance to talk about anything or seek any help cuz he wouldn't even let me know when he felt I was doing something wrong. I shouldn't have been so blind to it and I know that, but I thought I was trying. I tried so hard on the things he wanted fixed. I tried.

He stayed after that though. Flash forward 3 more months, I have the worst week I've had in our relationship, I was very aware of my wrong doings and told him everytime, but it didn't change how I was feeling. We were on a time crunch to get my me drivers license, I have college starting up in 2 weeks, and he's supposed to leave town for the first time for a week. This is all happening at the same time and I was horrified. I even broke down crying during my behind the wheel test and things hadn't been feeling too real for a few weeks, I didn't feel ready for any of it and because of it I felt like a failure. On top of that I felt I needed to be afraid of him leaving, like I NEEDED that fear. I knew he was stressed too because of how I felt and I knew I wasn't handling stuff well. Eventually I broke down, I was sobbing and yelling about how I wanted to die, I told him it's cuz I felt like a failure, because if I couldn't handle getting my license how am I supposed to handle school. This break down soon flipped into me yelling at him that he's going to leave. I KNEW my breakdowns were too much and I felt like he was going to go again for it, it felt inevitable.

The next day happens and all the bad feelings built up, and for the first time in 2 years I relapsed on self harm. When I got home that night i told him, and I told him I stopped because it wasn't worth it to myself to fall back into that behavior. I also told him that I was scared to tell him because I thought he'd leave if I got that weak and hurt myself. I was right, he left. He told me after he saw the mark on my leg he gave up on me. I know it's selfish to expect him to stay after that, but I really wish he did. I didn't want him to fix me, just to be there for me and talk about ways to get over this stress

After everything he came by to talk to me and told me all these things i had no clue he felt during our relationship. Things that I felt, if they were talked about, really could have been worked on and fixed, but he told me ""it's just not worth it"". He didn't want to stick around and work on anything. If he had mentioned couples therapy I would have done it in a heartbeat, if he had just needed space I would have done it in a moment, no guilt involved. 

He mentioned feeling like I didn't want him to see his siblings alone BUT HE NEVER TRIED. HE NEVER BROUGHT IT UP ONCE. I even asked him ""why haven't you seen you siblings in a whileyou should make plans soon."" But he decided that meant nothing. I tell him ""hey you should play the piano or do *insert hobby here* today, and I'll just play a video game"" but he decided I wanted him glued to me at all times. And undeniably there WERE times like that. I wanted him in the same room as me a lot, I wanted to he near him, but he never once told me that wasn't okay. He always entertained it, I didn't know. If he wasn't happy I wish he would have at least told me. Inwish he would have at least given me a chance. 

He also said i shouldn't ever ""subject"" someone to my thoughts of SH. I feel so destroyed. This was supposed to be my first healthy relationship and I did mess up, I did breathe down his neck too much but if he had at least talked to me I feel like i could have tried. I just want someone to communicate with me and give me a fighting chance.",tiddifukr69,,False,15i17q7,3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/15i17q7/going_through_a_breakup/
I read BPDlovedones. It helps me a lot.,1691115574.0,"I know about the stigma around this forum with BPD folks, but for me it's really important that I keep reading it.  
I think it's really easy to villainize the community - after all, we are prone to black and white thinking. However, in my case, I am an abuser.  
My last friend group told me I ruined their lives. I believe them. I do think they will recover and were overreacting a *tad,* but that shows just how badly I hurt them. One of them even hacked and deleted one of my old accounts! I must've been really bad to them, even if that specific action was unjust.  
I have had that same song and dance play for about... well, I've lost count of the years. You know why?  
Because I'm never accountable for my behavior.  
I am a victim. Or, was. My dad treated me like shit when i was an infant. I was bullied for seven and a half years.  
Now I create victims. I manipulate, abuse, lie, treat love as a game, and overall do not act like a good person- all to achieve affection and love to fill the void. The worst thing is- it works.  
But like I've said in a previous post. Underneath it all - I am a good person.  
But the thing I need to do is realize I am the abuser now in a cycle of abuse, and the people I hurt? Now that they're victims, they'll become abusers too. And it will continue on and on and on, and I have played my hand in that. There's no escaping it.  
BPDlovedones illustrates this best. It is a forum full of victims, trying to feel better, slowly becoming like us. They get mad. They get angry. They hate us, berate us, insult us.  
And the best thing we can do- is accept it. I accept this is the way I am.  
Yeah, it's not pretty. But it's a part of my personality- I embrace it. That doesn't mean I'll intentionally try to hurt people now, but yeah, people percieve me as a monster. Nothing I can do about it.  
I've been practicing a lot of DBT distress tolerance skills the past few days. And after practicing breathing, listening to the sounds around me, counting things I can see everytime I feel pain- I realized something.  
This immense pain I have won't kill me.  
Life goes on.  
I'm still fucking alive. I'm still surrounded by nature, a family, a world flourishing every day with life. I am, quite frankly, very lucky.  
I can live with this pain. Even if it is lifelong, even if it continues forever, I can live with it.  
So I can look at BPDlovedones, which feels like a knife through the heart, and accept what it is giving me - a change of perspective. I am so self absorbed. Even this post is self absorbed. That's how it has to be.   
I will continue reading it. I will stop talking about myself in relationships so much. It's not about me, it's about them - it's only about me when they **ask, or make it clear that they care.**  
I don't know if I'll ever feel like a normal person.  
The art I'm working on, which is how I feel others percieve me, surely won't help that.  
But fuck, I'll at least learn to accept myself.

Can't avoid it anymore: I'm lonely.,1691026415.0,"I was a discord addict. In my opinion, WORST thing for someone with BPD. The instant gratification of being able to send a message to like, 20 different people is horrible. I had to delete it. I am **never** going back.  
Now I have a couple friends I see now and then, and I'm pursuing my own endeavors.  
In all senses, I'm in a healthier place. I don't have friends anymore who I talk with 8-12 hours a day., 7 days a week, 365 days a year. I hurt them so badly. They'll never forgive me. But if I pursue less insanely intense relationships, and set more boundaries, and don't overshare, lie, or manipulate, etc etc, that won't happen again.  
I need a lot of alone time. A lot of reflection. Life is slower. I'm forced to sit with myself.  
It's so fucking hard. I'm bored. I want something, someone, to keep me entertained. I'm tired. I don't like myself yet. I wish I wasn't the problem. But I am; always have been. That's okay. This is how it has to be.  
But god, I hope I can have fufilling relationships someday. I hope, someday, I can communicate with someone - who isn't my family- in a healthy manner.  
I guess I already do, with the two friends I have. We don't talk all day, every day, and somedays our conversations are just how was your day.  
But still. The void in myself wants more. It will always want more.  
I don't know if that void ever gets filled in people with BPD because this illness isn't curable. I might always have to resist the urge to expect someone else to save me.  
But they won't. Nobody will. I'm my own hero.  
I can do this. I know i can. I won't stop telling myself positive things. I have to.  
But fuck. I'm lonely. I guess I have to sit with it. Accept it.

I am enough as I am,1690825594.0,"Recently I found out my fiancé had a habit of looking up slutty girls on Facebook.

He even screenshotted a girls IG handle with the intention of looking up her account later. She was an Asian bimbo with gigantic fake titties and a typical plastic surgery face.

This hurt me deeply. I’ve been struggling with PCOS and gained weight and struggle with acne. They’re also super skinny.

I’m also a girl and I know they wouldn’t look like how they do without surgery. Something I can’t afford and he can’t afford either if he wants a woman who looks like that.

Having BPD, of course my insecurities sky rocketed.

It doesn’t help that previously he told me he’s not attracted to me, that he’ll cheat on me if I don’t give him what he wants, how he’s bored of me, tired of me etc.

Finding this out was an extra stab to the heart and my self esteem.

I’d have to spend a fortune to look like those girls and probably reverse time by 10 years.

But idk. A small part of me feels better knowing that these girls only look like that because they augmented their bodies so heavily.

If I chopped up my nose and shaved my chin I’d probably look like that too.

I’m trying to appreciate my god given body. I’m very curvy with F cups. I’m also Asian. I have pale skin and shiny brown hair.

There is a lot to love and appreciate about me.

If he can’t see it, that’s his problem.

I can’t do anything about it if he’s not attracted to me. I can’t stop him from looking at them, cheating on me or him jerking off to them.

Is this despair or facing the facts?,1690374823.0,"What do I want?  

--to be loved  

--to be comfortable and be comforted  

--to have no unmet needs  

--to have no unfulfilled desires  

These goals are obviously unattainable, and I know that I crave them because i never had them as a child and then learned to reject (or at least distrust) them whenever they were offered.

Last night I wrote a few goals for myself, and whereas it's a depressing list, I don't feel it's an unreasonable one at my age (61) and in my situation (living entirely on public assistance but without social security or savings). I also feel completely unable to improve my situation and have so far been able to logically reject any suggestions of how I can change things

Here's the list. The first two are good, although very high goals for myself. The rest are pretty horrible, regardless of whether or not they're reasonable.  

Respond, don't react  

Keep yourself and your environment clean (I never clean my room, but I do pick up garbage in the street sometimes)  

Accept that your desires will not be met  

Recognize that your loneliness will not be lessened  

Accept that you are a slave to dissatisfaction and that satisfaction is out of reach  

Accept that your world will shrink and your life worsen  

Abandon hope -- it is a dangerous illusion   

Reduce your needs, including any physical ones  

Expect pain  

Reject encouragement: it is almost certain to be cozening intended to spark hope

Any suggestions? I can't think of any DBT skills to use, except ""check the facts"" and that's beyond my current level of insight.

Dating app advice,1690318511.0,"I recently came across a guy on a dating app whom I went on a couple dates with in 2015. (I'm very good with remembering faces!) At that time in my life, I was incredibly dysregulated and undiagnosed/untreated, and was using sex and substances as coping/connection.

Out of curiosity, I looked back at our texts. Apparently, we sexted A LOT and, also apparently, had sex once or twice. (I have very poor recall of this time.) We ended things after he stopped responding and I got prickly and confronted him. He apologized and told me I was ""amazing and beautiful,"" and that I deserve honesty. He said he gotten sick, and during that time he realized that he wants a relationship, which at the time I said I did not want. I got mad and texted something snide, and he did not respond. I totally get it. Again, dysregulation. 

Now in 2023, I am looking for a relationship. I'm medicated, in therapy, and actively working on getting my life together.  I remember liking him, and would be interested in seeing him again. 

Part of my BPD means that I get SO excited about someone, and then do Too Much.

Thinking about him dating anyone makes me sick to my stomach, but he's literally GAY (im she/they questioning but definitely closer to female than anything) and we're just really close friends. I don't want to kiss him or anything romantic or sexual and that's how I know it's 100 percent just really intense platonic love, but I want to be as close as possible to him all of the time. He just makes me feel safe like not many people have before. Thankfully his love language is also physical touch so he likes cuddling and that kind of stuff too. It's so hard to deal with the intensity of my attachment. If he started dating anyone it'd literally break me. I would have less of his attention and I'm so scared of losing him. He used to be asexual aromantic so I felt like I had him all to myself with no risk of a romantic partner sweeping him away, as controlling as that sounds. I hate these controlling tendencies.

How to manage my partner going on a trip?,1690212189.0,"As the title says, my partner is going on a trip at the end of the week and I’m starting to freak out.

He is in a competitive sport and once a year he goes to this week long event where they play their sport throughout the day and then hang out and party at night.

When he does this with his friends and people I know I can remain somewhat calm.

But he is going to this event without his friends. He is going to see old friends from all over the country and make new friends. I don’t know any of these people and I am freaked the fuck out.

He is going to spend all day every day with people I don’t know. He is going to stay up late every single night for a week with people I don’t know. I don’t know what he is going to be doing all day and I’m already terrified.

Just not knowing what he is doing and who he is with is scaring the shit out of me.

Logically - I trust him and believe that he will stay faithful and im not worried about anything.

Subconsciously I am just downright terrified. It feels like the end of the relationship - all I can see it threats and things to worry about. 

I need some advice to handle this. I am terrified of how scared and terrified I will be and im really scared I am going to split and freak out on him. I’m really scared that I’ll struggle with this and make his trip miserable. 

I need advice. How do you handle trips? I was better with trips before my parents died this spring - but since my parents died I have had a much harder time with my BPD.

Toxic shame vs. healthy guilt,1689780120.0,"I want to share a concept that I recently learned that has been a game changer for me.

A lot of us with BPD were raised by emotionally immature parents. So when we messed up or did bad things like all kids do - we were punished of course, but mostly in our families - we were SHAMED. We were told that we were BAD KIDS for doing the bad thing. Or perhaps your parent withdrew affection when you were bad, or stayed angry and never talked to you about the incident - and since kids lack the mental ability to depersonalize - you of course would blame yourself. 

“My mom stopped hugging me because I’m bad”.

My mom ignored me because I did something wrong.

This is the natural way for young children to think. It is shame-based personalization. “I must be responsible for everything that happens to me”. But if kids grow up in healthy households, that thinking is replaced with guilt-based thinking. This takes the personalization out of the equation.

I messed up, but that doesn’t mean I’m a bad person. 

My mom stopped hugging me, but that doesn’t mean she stopped loving me, she’s just angry because I did something bad. 

This is the toxic-shame vs. healthy guilt dynamic. 

People with BPD often experience shame-based thinking when we do something “bad”. We think we don’t deserve love anymore, that we should be kicked out of the relationship, that the other person must have stopped loving us, because we are now a “bad person who does bad things”.

Where as healthy people might say: “I am a good person, who went through a hard time and did a bad thing. I feel guilt for that thing, and that guilt is good!”

Do you see the difference?

I think the biggest thing I keep being reminded of by my therapist and my partner is exactly that: you’re a person who struggles with things, and who is going through a hard time. You make mistakes, and it’s good that you feel guilty for them, because you won’t make those mistakes again, or you will work to change them.

In this line of thinking, the core of my identity is not attached to my behaviors. I can still be a good person even if I make mistakes.

I find that we apply the same personalized-based thinking to others when we split too. We lose the ability to attribute a behavior to a situation, and we attribute a behavior to a person’s whole self. “They did a bad thing, are they a bad person?”

Obviously a lot of morality gets called into question with this. There are a lot of people in the world who think themselves as good people who do very hurtful and harmful things. 

But just apply this to the guilt and shame you feel about your own actions and I find that this can disarm a lot of the shame and “unloveable” feelings that crop up inside. The next time you feel that you are completely unloveable for something you did, ask yourself, are you a bad person? Or do you just feel guilty?

If you feel guilty, that’s a really solvable problem. You’re a loveable person who fucked up and who want to do better. Or should you be ashamed of your whole self and you don’t deserve good things because you’re so terrible?

When your partner messes up are they a whole terrible person and have always been? Or did they just make a mistake and an apology and a promise to work on it would make everything better?",Astrnougat,,False,153y0ds,36,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/153y0ds/toxic_shame_vs_healthy_guilt/

Ex pwBPD Reflection,1689443070.0,"My ex pwBPD [43f] told me,

>I love you but I’m not in love with you. Because the person you met before was not me. Because in the moment I was completely out of it and the person you met was a crazy f****** b**** who was 20 something. Like I can remember everything we were saying. People switch (split?), I switched (split?) myself. When I don’t want to feel pain or whatever I run away and I start doing stupid shit. And that’s the reason I’m hiding and it’s coming out this other person. The therapist said it happened because of everything you went through in your life. 
My therapist told me, “Do you know that what are you doing right is not correct, it’s not you? That you’re just toxic right now and damaging that person.” And I think it’s the best, it’s much better because when she starts working on when I was abused, and it’s going to be very soon, believe me I don’t wanna go through that pain. I don’t want to be with nobody. I don’t wanna have a boyfriend that’s the problem you don’t understand. I don’t want a boyfriend. I don’t want a man touch me. I don’t want anything. I don’t want to future with a man. want to be alone. 
Because when I met you, I was escaping from my ex-boyfriend. and I was just escaping. that’s the reason you met the person. it wasn’t me because I was lost. I’m still lost but in the moment I was completely out of control without the correct medication. 

Some questions I have,

1. Is this common for a BPD episode or a manic episode?

2. Do borderlines ever want to reconcile with their healthy/supportive ex partners after going through medication, intensive DBT and CBT? Even if this is a matter of years into recovery? We are friends now, and my ex borderline is extremely sorry and feeling beyond guilty for hurting me. She cares about me **immensely** and is still extremely sweet to me. She does not want a relationship but does not want one in general. The mention of wanting to be with nobody, not wanting a husband, and a future alone sounds like borderline black-and-white thinking. 

Also she mentioned in the past while we were still together and her BPD was triggered,

>I am not able to have a relationship with you or nobody else because It **never** going to work 
out because of my condition.

It sounds like very dichotomous thinking that you’d
see with BPD.

This woman felt **destroyed** when she knew she hurt me and broke down crying to tell me she was sorry for pushing me away, that she just wants the best for me.

Broke up with me two days after my birthday and we came back from holiday and met his grandparents. I still can’t believe it’s truely over.

I Need Guidiance,1688757937.0,"I've been on antidepressants and medicated for major depressive disorder & panic disorder since I was 13. When I was 16 I attempted to overdose (impulsively & unplanned) & was inpatient at a mental hospital for 7 days. The following year, I met someone who I thought would help me grow, I saw a future with him. He was 22 and I 16, we started dating. He turned 23 in spring & I 17 that summer. We were together until I was 19. He was a narcissist, an addict, he gaslit me & verbally/mentally abused me. I stayed single for a while and just kind of explored & lived life. At this point I had not recognized the behavioral patterns of BPD. In 2020, I met a girl who brought so much light into my life. She'd been through so much, we went though so much together. I've never had such a supportive, loving & affirming partner. This past year was very rough on us. I crashed in late September, unable to function. I couldn't get out of bed, couldn't work, could hardly take care of myself - leaving all the responsibility on her. We lost our house, our cars, our animals - everything. We moved in with my parents at the end of February following the eviction. I had been in trauma therapy for PTSD related to childhood trauma, sexually assault + more family related trauma growing up. My family pressed I discuss with my therapist the idea of bipolar (none of us knew what BPD was at this time). My therapist was indignant about the suggestion & disregarded it altogether. I continued therapy for a bit longer before deciding to seek alternative resources after having an extreme mental breakdown in April. Throughout this low point I'd been struggling with extreme mood swings, triggered by unknown causes. I've had no control over my emotions & I've said & done harmful things to myself, my family & my ex partner involved. I've struggled with such overbearing emotions, the thought of suicide seems like the only escape. I saw a psychiatrist and was put on a medication to assist with the impulsive behaviors. I'm on the path to finding a good therapist as the psychiatrist believed I have BPD. 
As good as my partner has been to me I've made point throughout the relationship that when I hit these lows and say terrible things, she didn't deserve to be treated that way & deserved better. I've done & said terrible things to her & she insisted on being with me and wanting to help me & take care of me while also disregarding her own needs. There were times I felt suffocated, overwhelmed by her. At this point I expressed that I can't be in a relationship because I'm hardly a functional person, let alone partner. Due to the circumstances, I've not been in the position to distance myself from her & she's always been forceful when I've asked for any kind of space. Our relationship had deteriorated so much because of all of these factors. When we've argued there comes a point before I know I'm going to lose control of my emotions, I just want space & need the argument/conversation to pause/end so I can think properly and try to come back with a clear mind to resolve the problem. This is space I never really recieved and today that placed the final nail in the coffin of our relationship during an argument. After warning her several times & trying to end the argument, she continued & I finally lost my cool. I threw an empty phone case at her & tried to calm down after. But she continued & I forcefully smacked hands, holding her glasses & broke them before my brother interfered and held onto me to stop me & try to calm me down. I'm not proud of this, nor any of the other things I've done leading up to the argument & previous ones we've had. I'm at a bit of a loss with emotional management, I don't really know how to get through this. I've been through a breakup before, but not in such a low position in life. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm lost, I feel week, broken & angry at myself, at the world. I'm 23 and I feel like I have nothing going for myself, I've lost nearly everything & have no bearings.

"A degree of gratitude and will to live. TW: drug use, SI",1688615161.0,"I took LSD roughly 13 hours ago. Here are some reflections on the day. I wrote much of this during the experience and have stitched it together to some degree. I think you will find my thoughts and feelings of interest; I hope that you will experience some pleasure, gratitude and pride in these words and the developments they appear to represent.

I am shedding immense numbers of tears of gratitude today: I was able to wait out the pain. It took sixty years, but it's happening. I'm winning in the struggle against mental illness.

You have no idea how beautiful this feels - both in the moment, and as a prospect for having a life worth living - for which my non-attachment and tranquility grow on most days.

If I believed in the supernatural, I'd say that psychedelics are a gift from god. We are truly lucky as human beings to be neurologically capable of experiencing entheogens.

Nonetheless, part of me is content with viewing it essentially as physical therapy - my brain is rewiring itself in more beneficial ways.

I can only ascribe my apparent beginnings at recovery as having a cumulative effect. I'd say that it's miraculous that our minds and our nervous systems can process entheogens and religious enthusiasm, which many seem to mislabel as ecstasy. Religious enthusiasm is exactly the opposite of ecstasy - the feeling comes from outside, not inside. The etymology says it all: en- vs ecs- (which is only because of the vagaries of English spelling). Whether it comes from a deity or anything else doesn't matter. The only thing that matters are the experience and the fact that it springs from outside ourselves. 

How can I be so pragmatically spiritual while being so deeply atheistic? Reading William James with Dr Shafer helped (he was the Professor of Religion and chaplain at Bard): the only thing that matters is the result. If it helped, it counts. End of story. It doesn't need to be any more complicated than that, so why get into assessing or assigning any value or passing any judgement on ethical motive? At sunset, the relief matters, and that's enough.

I'm overwhelmed by gratitude today.

Today has been a fabulous and I suspect, potentially especially therapeutic stop on my current path. I think it's fair to say that over the course of the last four months, I have started living in a better way than I ever have before, or could have dreamed. Today seems to promise particularly positive effects on a deeply emotional level - more openly emotional than I have experienced during my experiences this spring and summer. 

It is fair to say that at least 80% of the time I am living in a better way than I ever have, or could have dreamed. Even on otherwise unremarkable days, I sometimes find myself on the verge of tears of gratitude. 

I have no real idea to whom or what I owe my gratitude, but it's probably not narcissistic to say that I owe some gratitude to myself, if for no other reason than the fact that I have made it this far. It would also be unfair not to express my debt to Albert Hofmann, in his current avatar, a dose of LSD. 

Actually, a living blue volcano seems more apt: there's a lot of powerful change happening beneath the surface. It's roiling so that it may relieve a lifetime on the brink of explosion and extinction.

That's an admittedly heavy-handed way to put it, but I find it both experientially accurate and rhetorically satisfying.

The more I let myself enjoy being alive, the more gratitude I feel. Not just because of the relief, but the simple fact that it's fine to have some fun in life.

One notable and exciting aspect of today's experience is revealed in the amount I have cried: perhaps I am crying so much because the tears have, metaphorically speaking, been dammed up for so long. Indeed, I might say that the accompanying gratitude and relief reflect decades of deferred hope and joy.

CAVEAT EMPTOR: Psychedelics are not for everyone, and I have been taking LSD on a twice-monthly basis. I have a very large amount of experience taking psychedelics - I have done so on a regular basis for a bit more than 40 years. Do not proceed down this road without close and candid discussion with a psychiatrist and psychotherapist. To do otherwise is asking for trouble, possibly more trouble than you can imagine.

**One other note: I am taking relatively large doses of LSD when I do so.

Sorry for this long rant, trying to make sense of my broken life and needed to share with others who might be more understanding about what I’m going through, with my mental illness.

How do you find yourself again after being so lost? Grasping for hope, I want to change my life. Tired of living this low life. My boyfriend and I broke up 9 months ago, he was my FP. I did a lot to damage our relationship and engaged in a lot of self sabotaging. He’s at fault too, for things in the relationship. We broke up I slept with someone and got pregnant. Sadly I’ve been dealing with a lot of guilt and shame about the situation. I want so badly to reconnect and reconcile our broken relationship. I’ve been in an incredibly lonely and depressed state. I miss the good parts of our relationship and certainly do not want to go back to the dysfunctional state our relationship ended up being. Throughout the relationship I self medicated and numbed my feelings with weed and alcohol, I let it cloud everything. With being pregnant I’ve become sober, and I’m trying to deal and correct my behaviors. I’ve been seeing the psychiatrist to get a proper diagnosis and a treatment plan, seeking out therapy. I heavily rely on others to make me feel whole, or I just isolate until it’s absolutely crippling. I’m 7 months pregnant now and I’m confused by everything, baby daddy isn’t involved and is toxic and probably just as unstable as I am….but I’m doing all things to prepare for the twins. I don’t know if I’m grasping for straws with my ex to fill the void I’m feeling. I’ve done a lot of splitting towards him and caused a lot of unnecessary turmoi. I’m bipolar 2, suffer from CPTSD and BPD. I also am already a single mother to a 12 year old who is extremely fond of my ex. His father isn’t involved in his life and the closest thing he has had to a fatherly figure is my ex. We both miss him greatly. What is your honest take/opinion on my situation, is there hope for us? Or should I just pick up the broken pieces, let go and move forward? My ex has been incredibly patient with me and my Illness but I stayed stuck in denial that I needed help. But being clear headed I see more clearly. Since finding out I was pregnant my ex has expressed that he wants to be there and father my twins, but I’m afraid I’m too late. He moved across the state to be with another woman but at the same time I know I’d he felt it was worth it he would drop everything to be with me….. we both have mad love for each other but so afraid that things can’t and won’t get better, but also hope that things can change and growth will come, despite our setbacks.",Old-Meet-1322,,False,14q68cv,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/14q68cv/relationship_dilemma/

NSFW/MTW I know I’m abusive,1688021858.0,"Hey, I am diagnosed BPD, ADHD, MDD, PD, and have suspected OCD. I am abusive. All types of abuse abuser. I’ve told the doctors but I don’t feel taken seriously. I literally told one I slapped my then partner and he said I’m okay. Yeah sure but my ex wasn’t. It’s not acceptable. I’m a tiny female and I think its apart of why I’m not taken seriously. The physical abuse component didn’t start until I got on the IUD but one doctor (who took me somewhat seriously) told me it was probably always there. N I have since learned about the stage of abuse before physical abuse, where there’s throwing and breaking things. I’ve always done that even as a child. Anyways I am abusive and I know it but I don’t know how to fix it. I want to change. 

Here’s what I’ve tried 

DBT: Group therapy session ended badly as another group member upset me and I responded with verbal abuse and stopped therapy. Tried with a group a few years later but just couldn’t focus on the zoom meetings, wasn’t beneficial for me.

Mindfulness: I can’t sit still to focus and do it. I go nuts trying. Can’t stand it. I hate mindfulness so much. It’s the worst.

Meds: I unfortunately respond poorly to meds and abuse the ones that do work when I have a panic attack & the affect isn’t fast enough. N the ones that I don’t have that problem with I can’t take consistently even with reminders bc I’m terrible about being consistent. Not sure if there’s ADHD tricks to combat that? 😫 I’d take them everyday if I could get over this hurdle.

Gym: This actually helps A LOT but unfortunately I’m still having intense fits of rage and I fear hurting someone again. I am technically adding to my strength even if this helps me release anxiety & stress. 

Religion: This also helps A LOT however again I’m still having intense episodes. Yes they’re fewer and further than before but they’re still dangerous.

Things I want to try but can’t afford atm:

Diet change: I’ve heard it can actually help, and I’d love to try but eating healthy costs so much! I’m probably going about it wrong.

1v1 Therapy: I think it’d help but I can’t afford it, I have access through my medical but it’s been a fight n I honestly stopped trying and need to try again. I have gotten it before but kept being told “you’re so self aware” vs what I could do to change my behaviors.

I really want to change. I don’t want to be verbally and emotionally abusive anymore.  I don’t want to hit myself or others when I’m upset. I’m extremely manipulative and I’m terrified of what I’m capable of when my rage occurs. It’s instant and difficult to control. There have been situations where I chose not to control it, and I’ll own up to that. However at times it is truly uncontrollable. Regardless I really want to change. I’m not sure what else to try, maybe work books? Idk. I’ve been diagnosed with BPD roughly 3 years now and still suffer greatly despite treatment. Someone close to me thinks I might be misdiagnosed and actually have Intermittent Explosive Disorder but I have no idea. I fit almost all 9 BPD criteria.",No-Gur5520,,False,14lxsj2,10,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/14lxsj2/nsfwmtw_i_know_im_abusive/
book for my partner?,1688011252.0,"I am hoping to buy my partner a book so they can understand BPD more. I have asked them to research it on their own and just send me what they find so i can let them know if its accurate or just stigmatizing BS. I think they may just be intimidated by how much bias and misinformation is out there and they have asked me about books. 

What (if any) books exist as a resource for partners of people with BPD that explains what BPD is, how to support us, and how they can hold their own boundaries in this sort of dynamic?

Maybe such a book doesnt exist but I would be happy with any of those 3 things.

EDIT: Anyone who responds to this assuming that im not putting in any work needs to fuck off. I've already sent them all sorts of stuff. I am in therapy. I have a workbook. I journal. None of my symptoms are severe they way they were even as recently as two years ago. I put in hard work every single day to manage this disorder that was given to me through being abused (reminder, none of us fucking asked to be like this). My partner fails to express external interest in my BPD. IMO if someone knowingly signs up to date someone with BPD they are signing up to do hard shit sometimes. It's not like I surprised them with this disorder, I told them on our 3rd date, well before we entered a comitted exclusive relationship, that I have BPD and that it is something they were going to need to learn about. It is immensely triggering to be in a relationship where half of the time when I am triggered it's at this point avoidable had they just done some research. But instead the labor of that gets put on me because ""im the one whose fucked up"" despite my constant begging for support, constant self work, constant self restraint. I am burnt out, suicidal, and at my limit. IMO reading a few articles on google is the BARE MINIMUM. If I had chronic kidney disease i know for a fact that people would not be telling me that its my responsibility to send people articles. A mental injury is no different then a physical one so take your ableism and shove it up your ass because what we have is a fucking disability. Why is this one of the only disabilities where the disabled person is constantly the one who is 100% responsible for their own recovery? That literally inhuman. IMO thats YOUR trauma speaking and projecting on to me.So fuck off with that because I know that I am worthy of a loving supportive relationship where people take interest in learning about my disability and take interest in how to support me.

My room mate took an entire class on how to have someone with BPD in your life and how to support them. I didn't even ask them to do this, they did it because they love and care about me and wanted to understand where i come from. We are ALL worthy of that kind of love, respect, compassion, empathy, support.

Experiencing bad things feel more familiar and easier than experiencing good thing. I dont know what to do and I need help,1687876681.0,"Hi, I am 22(M) and I feel stuck because the thing I mentioned in the title. I feel the need that it needs to be explained further.
When bad things happen I get extremely depressed, I stop eating for long periods and I start to rely on alcohol in those times. However, there is no uncertainty in that. If a bad thing happens I know what I will do or what will happen to me. On the other side, when something good happens lets say something romantically happens or I improve myself in an aspect of my life I get so scared because I think that I might lose it. Also, it does not feel familiar and it feels uncertain. 
Those things haunt me more than experiencing bad things.

So what happens most of the time is that I spend time in my own melancholy or grief. Then I try my best to get out of that mindset and endure the uncertainty of a good event. However, at some point that good thing does not go as how I want and booom, I am in my melancholic and depressed era again.

"I had my first ""breakdown"" today in a long time",1687845041.0,"Looking for support and venting

Woke up feeling lethargic, had a horribly invalidating weekend. I decided to work from home instead of go into the office. My boss decides to make it a big deal that I come in and I'm in no mood emotionally or mentally to deal with the scrutiny. I'm definitely elevated, and anxious, but logical at this point. He asks me about wfh schedule and how I was supposed to be in the office today. (In the past mentioning any health issues he pushes back and doesn't really accept what I give him). Instead of being honest I go right to defending myself, ""okay, is my performance poor?""
He says no. 
""Have I missed important communications?"" 
He says no. 
Is my quality of work or deliverables failing at all?
Again he says no.

""So given all of that why so much insistence on the hyper consistent in office vs out of office"". He kept giving his spchiel about how we need to be available and bla bla. Once again I repeat to him, ""have I not been available or missed something important in communications?"" He says no. 

I told him how I don't feel comfortable telling him sometimes about my mental health or physical health issues because when I first hired on he was such a dick about time off. (Note: I didn't say dick. I was more tactful in choosing my words. Said he wouldn't accept the state I communicated to him and pushed for more. the other employees are early 20s fresh grads, so they don't know any better. I'm 31 lol). Of course he apologized but we've had this conversation before I'm pretty sure. He even had the audacity to say he doesn't want to babysit me. I told him, ""well then don't. If my work is quality what is the problem?""

I even went as far to say that I do enjoy coming into the office. Because I do! But if I'm having a bad brain day, oh boy I try my best to be remote so I'm not causing issues for others. Hopefully my therapist can give me something to give to HR to back me up here. 

This is coupled with a call about vacation time in July which I'm planning on taking anyway. I was honest with him and told him, ""look I can take 2 days off of my vacation if it's really that big of a deal but I will be going on this vacation"". 

He gets back to me at the end of the day and he essentially tells me he's approved the paid vacation and that I have 2 options for wfh. I tell him that I philosophically disagree with the company's stance on on in office matters but that I understand it's the company's policy. Stand my ground while complying felt good. 
 now I'm just kinda waiting until my appointment to get some backup. I should also say before we hung up I did apologize if I came off elevated or aggressive from that morning and he said no hard feelings. I'm not counting my chickens. Time to look for a new job. I don't fit in here. These are all perfect people who don't seem to ever have fuckups or any issues. 

I am in the wrong office to have mental health issues. These kids kill themselves for this job and it's kinda sad to see. Oh well, I am job searching now because I am tired of being under so much scrutiny for tying to take care of myself and my health. This isn't the first time weve had these issues lol


After the call I went and cried for about 30 minutes. I fantasized about killing myself, didn't eat enough today, didn't drink enough water. It was a bad day.

I don’t know who I am, and that stresses me out. I’ve only 
Lever been what I thought other people wanted. I used to pride myself on being entertaining and a social chameleon at the very least, but I’m scared that it came from some sort of weird obsessive need for others to validate me. I’ve been on the borderline of a religious psychosis. I know this is a “BPD” sub, but I’ve got a slew of trauma and a mother with undiagnosed but apparent BPD. Everyone in my extended family hates her, yet the comparisons are always there, and for good reason. I’m a 19 y/o male, but I’m still scared of becoming just like her.

I’ve struggled with dependency on alcohol, thc, and pornography starting from 12 years old. I finally decided to quit everything because I’m just ready to really get better, but it’s such a hard weird and confusing process. I feel like I cant really be helped. My only hope is moving out from my grandparents place this august, but even then I haven’t been taking care of anything I’m supposed to. 

I can’t hold down a job, I’m admittedly immature and narcissistic a lot. I have really bad problems with lashing out at others. I lost my best friend last week because she told me she “liked me better on drugs”. It was a joke I’m sure, but on top of her continuing to pretty much ignore me, I got the message that she hated me now. I cussed her out, said almost every terrible thing I could to her (I can think of more now), and continued to cut off every other person from my small town because I realized as a gay man, I was completely neglecting who I really felt I was fall ‘22 semester of college, before I dropped out because I was never focused on my schoolwork and just completely neglected every responsibility of mine. That’s also when I “dated” someone for the first time, only for him to cut it off after two months because I made a little gift basket for him when he got sick, and only then for me to find out that he moved on right afterwards.

I’m so tired of my fucked up early life experiences having absolute control over my shitty fucked up life. My last suicide attempt was in March, because on the second date with a guy, I asked him what he graduated from high school that May. 

No one understands me. I hate everything, everyone and this whole world. I can’t look anywhere, even at myself without seeing nothing but shit.

I’m in my 1st year at university as a mature student and I have been isolating myself because I’m scared that I’ll go out and embarrass myself but even now I sometimes get an intense desire to just drop my life and do porn.
On top of my sever hyper-sexuality I obviously have some problematic links. I say problematic because they are causing problems in my own life. When I am having sex I can only get off if I tell myself that they don’t care about me and I’m being used. Because of this I have put myself in dangerous situations multiple times that have resulted in my being harmed. I think one could guess what situations I mean seeing as I get blackout drunk every-time I drink.

Microdosing,1687459524.0,"A lot of people with PDs seem interested in microdosing, and others strongly advocate for it.

An article in today's Washington Post discusses microdosing generally, and addresses the possibility that the effectiveness of microdosing may be due to affirmation bias. 

It's worth a read if you're not familiar with current trends in the research, particularly if you are considering trying microdosing.

If psychedelics interest you, please discuss it in detail with your psychiatrist and therapist, and be as cautious as possible. There's some solid research being done, but a fair number of people (both MH professionals and clients) either ignore those findings or cheerlead approaches that lack empirical/statistically reasonable support.

My friends who make mistakes, or bc of BPD become the focus of my extreme criticism are easily rooted for from deeper more whole parts of myself. My wise mind more easily connects with why it is absurd or so risky and petulant for me to go down a bad path mentally with their value in my head. I have so many good experiences to talk me down off the splitsville ledge to reason with myself and catch myself splitting. With turbulent relationships of past I had good reason to judge a person's character in a negative light and examining splitting was not so easy to make progress from.

I cut off a person I really liked because I didn’t like how they made me feel,1687352079.0,"I’m 28F and single for a couple of years. Every now and again I dip my toes into the dating game and often get really hurt. I easily fall into the anxious-avoidant pattern, being the anxious attached partisan. The avoidant person becomes my FP. So for 2-8 weeks, I experience a rollercoaster of extreme highs and lows depending on wether they are giving me attention or ignoring me. While I’m generally happy single, when I’m dating someone who fits this pattern my BPD symptoms really flare up.

Recently, I made a tinder and ended up talking with a guy for several weeks before meeting up. By the time we met, I felt like he was everything I could ever want in a human. On our date, we talked for hours and kissed in a park. It felt perfect.

Over the next few days, he left me on read for 12+ hours. I started feeling obsessive and awful. Nothing outside of that person made me happy. I knew that if I was patient, I could probably continue seeing him for a another few weeks. But I also knew that those few weeks would be absolutely awful for me.

I cut him off when he posted a meme on social media about pooping his pants while leaving me on read. I texted him and said that while I enjoyed meeting him, I didn’t see things going any further. He sent back a polite reply almost immediately. I felt like throwing up.

I think I’ll feel awful over the next few days but then my brain will reset itself and I’ll be back to normal. I’m glad I broke things off before I got in too deep.

Unreality,1687270220.0,"Does anyone else know how to combat intense and pervasive feelings of unreality? I know, logically, it is dissociation/depersonalization/derealization but I genuinely can't shake the feeling.

For as long as I can remember, I've dealt with this feeling of 'not being real' or 'not really being here'.

The first instance I ever remember of experiencing this was all the way back in grade school and looking around the class room and suddenly being hit with this overwhelming thought of 'this is really happening; I am really here'. It felt like I had just awaken from a dream yet the thought/realization felt more like a panicked pit in my stomach rather than relief. Everything felt foreign and unfamiliar. It was like this blinding and terrible clarity I had yet to experience up until that point.

Today, almost two decades later, I often experience this same feeling. I can almost will it if I try to be mindful and take in my surroundings but that same alien feeling remains. Mindfulness is supposed to evoke a sense of calm and control but it seems when I try to be consciously aware I feel lost, like I'm not supposed to be here. 

It's a weird mixture of disconnection and almost fear. My life doesn't feel quite mine and those around me suddenly begin to feel like strangers to the point of paranoia or anxiety. 

I don't feel like I actually 'know' anyone. I don't feel like I truly belong in any given situation. I honestly feel more comfortable dissociated because I don't have that blinding awareness of everything being 'off'. 

I often experience longing, almost homesickness but for nothing and no one I can place in my actual life. I feel like im missing people I've never met and places I've never been. And all of these things compound to a singular feeling of complete loneliness.

I can't really explain any better than that, so I hope  someone can make sense of this and even more so maybe help me make sense of how better to cope and be more present without feeling like I am a stowaway on aboard some extraterrestrial ship on a planet far far away lol.",drtyknckls,,False,14ec785,3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/14ec785/unreality/
"S3X Obsession *TW SA, Addiction",1687224182.0,"So for as long as I (27/F) remember I've been obsessed with sex. Since my early teens I remember only being able to get to sleep by imagining scenarios that ultimately always ended with engaging in some sort of sexual contact with fictional or real people. 

I've always struggled with intrusive sexual thoughts as well as dreams about people close to me and strangers alike. From just picturing them naked to full-on, hard-core, x-rated thoughts. This has always disturbed me rather than been a point of arousal because the people and situations that arise are not always 'ideal', let's say.

Recently, I've realized every relationship I've pursued has been an attempt to have consistent sex and almost every one of those relationships have ended due to not being satisfied with my partners comparatively lower libido or my own self-esteem issues regarding sex.

And that's the thing, I am so self-conscious that I rarely initiated in those relationships. The 'me' in my fantasies never quite measures up to me in real sexual exploits or my partner does not show the level of passion, sensuality or control that I desire so I feel insecure.

I think I may have a CNC kink which is why I don't enjoy initiating, but at the same time, I feel objectified or violated if I don't explicitly consent.

In my current relationship I struggle with this deeply. He has openly admitted to struggling with erectile dysfunction yet every night I go to bed hoping he intiates sex, and when he doesn't, I end up feeling insecure or angry. And even in the few instances I have initiated or asked for it, I feel angry and ashamed after because I feel like it's out of pity. Or he can't finish so I don't feel desired or desireable.

The weird part is now I struggle sleeping because I feel as if I'm betraying him by engaging in my spicy daydreams before bed. And when I try to fantasize about him I feel disgusted unless I picture him with someone else which is equally as distressing.

I took a break from porn but I recently 'relapsed' for lack of a better term because I feel like it's the only way for me to feel, at least temporarily, satisfied.

I understand this is likely due to hypersexuality from sexual trauma but I'm unsure if I am in the territory of sex addiction or if this simply points to some deep-rooted insecurities due to that trauma.

I am open to any feedback or insight anyone has and would be oh so relieved to know that I'm not alone.

Watch out now

Take care, beware the thoughts that linger

Winding up inside your head

The hopelessness around you

In the dead of night

Beware of sadness

Watch out now

Take care, beware of soft shoe shufflers

Dancing down the sidewalks

As each unconscious sufferer

Wanders aimlessly

Beware of Maya

When to and not to raise their voices

It's you that decides

Which way you will turn

While feeling that our love's not your concern

It's you that decides

No one around you will carry the blame for you

No one around you will love you today

And throw it all away

But how do I explain

When not too many people

Can see we're all the same?

And because of all their tears

Their eyes can't hope to see

The beauty that surrounds them

Isn't it a pity?

Soon after things got a bit worse and then she slowely came back. 
She regretted what happened and I don't Blame her or have Any anger towards her about what happened.

I could't dat no anymore, was afraid of anger and took on a caretaker role. And a couple of self-harm episodes to which i was a ""trigger"". (details later). 
So when she came back we met up a couple of times and i felt the paterns returning and asked her if we could go no contact for a while (after she had a safe place to stay). 
Now its been 6 months and I have been in therapy as well started learning more about BPD. 
Now I want to contact her again hoping that with what we both Learned we might be together again in some way. However i am still worried, and unsure if it can work or if i have already lost her. If she feels abondened

It feels like something takes your breath away, punches you, and puts a fog all around you. Panicking and not being able to see right.

Going to start treatment tomorrow,1686707295.0,"I (M23) was diagnosed with BPD last month after I went to the hospital for suicidal and homicidal ideation. I also scored super high on antisocial and narcissistic traits, and I'm not sure how to feel about that, even though I know it's true. I know that having this disorder doesn't make me evil, but it felt like the psychiatrist was calling me that. The hospital people put me on Latuda (I'm on 3 other things too, and one doesn't work so I'm tapering off) and told me that I have to get a DBT therapist instead of the psychodynamic one I've been seeing for 6 years and love very much. They also referred me to a partial program, which I start tomorrow.

I'm really nervous. I'm in a lot of pain. I have rage episodes when I'm alone, and panic attacks, and I drink and cut myself. My mood swings are intense, and I go between being tired, and just hating everyone and wanting to hurt them. I'm also bipolar and am having a depressive episode right now. I know I have to stop these behaviors, but I don't know much about DBT or the coping skills that are part of it, and I'm afraid that it won't help me. I want it to, but part of me is scared to get better. I know I have to talk about the negative ways I think about people and myself, and the violent impulses, but I have so much shame. I'm also autistic and have meltdowns from overstimulation and social situations, and I struggle with communication and talking, so it's hard to gauge what is BPD and needs to be fixed with DBT, and what is autism and would be harder/unethical to try to change. I don't want my therapist to mix up the two and hurt me.

The doctors also want me to go back on lithium. I was on it for 7 years and it really helped me, but the side effects ended up being sooo bad. I think it might be best to go back on it, though, because I feel like my mind has been punishing me since I went off.

Do you guys think that talking your emotions out is ineffective?,1686666873.0,"I recently came to terms that I have BPD. I started working with a new therapist last week and she was debating whether or not I have it. I'm pretty sure I do. Whenever I've come across something BPD related online I'd relate to it, and the more I research it the more I relate.

Anyway, I wanted to know if people here related to something I've experienced. I've always been told that I should talk about my issues with a friend. Specifically, I had a guy who would always tell me that ""a problem shared is a problem halved"". That hasn't been the case for me. It rarely helps when I talk about my emotions, especially if I'm just venting. It's like my emotions are an immovable wall that can only be changed by another immovable wall smashing on top of it.

I guess that's the main point of this post. Do other people relate to this or do you find that a problem shared is a problem halved?

Ok, now for some extra stuff.

I was in rehab for a month and I had a therapy session with my FP (I feel weird using that term when I haven't been officially diagnosed, but that's the best way I can describe it). I tried venting to him about an issue we shared thinking that he could help me. I was a huge emotional mess. He then ghosted me for a few days. Eventually, he answered my call and told me that he needed space. About two weeks later, with the encouragement of my therapist, I invited him to join in on a family session. During the session, he lamented about how hard it was on him when I vented. I'm paraphrasing a bit, but he said that it was hard on him because he couldn't get me out of my hole of self pity. I've come to the conclusion that I shouldn't talk with someone who isn't my therapist about my emotions because it'll put stress on the person I'm talking to. But it's hard to keep the emotions inside except for one day out of the week. I want to talk to people, but how can I do that when it causes people pain? Does anyone have any tips on this?

How do I know I’m making real progress?,1686588535.0,"I’m currently about 8 months diagnosed with BPD. I’m married and have been with my partner for 9 years now. We have 2 Kids together and over the years what we thought was “normal” marital issues turned out to be some deep rooted issues I had from my childhood. We both struggle with depression and for a while I was reluctant to engage in therapy and medication but once I realized how serious my condition was and accepted what I had, I started medication about 4 months ago. I still have triggers and coping struggles I’m having to work through but I feel like weekly therapy and medication have helped me come a long way. Unfortunately, over the last month I’ve had a ton of issues that have compounded and resulted in a couple episodes between me and my partner. Financial struggles combined with issues at work including a recent mass layoff (I survived) and then struggles with my side business put me in a place of extreme stress and I did not do a good job at coping with this stress and let small things at home cause me to lash out emotionally. I feel like my ability to regulate my emotions has improved a lot and then when I do have moments of poor coping I am much quicker to respond and accept what I’ve done wrong and talk through how I could be better in the future. This has all come to a head though to where now my Partner has said they now feel hopeless and do not know if they want to keep going while I continue working on this. My therapist says this may be a common response and I’m trying to hard to stay positive and focused and not spiraling. They don’t feel like the progress is enough and I’m not sure what to do. They seem willing to continue going to counseling and cohabitating, so I think the best thing is to be patient and keep doing the work.

slowly but surely I'm making it,1686345948.0,"It's been a while since i posted on this reddit but so much has changed and grown. I grew a lot, got help, made new friends, found lovers along the way and with each passing day, I began to heal despite the new pain coming in. 

I don't really know where I am on my BPD remission journey... But it's possible. 

It's possible to have healthy relationships in both friends and romance without splitting so bad. It's even easier when they all understand that you're a human and need a chance to process and hold you accountable for the the things that hurt them. 

They gave me a chance to grow, believed in my potential to heal and be better, they aided me with peer review and accountability and of course with every friend and romantic partner i lost, I begin to realize, newer, better ones come in and offer new perspectives and different ways to cope and grow. 

I sit here now, writing this as I do my Relationship DBT questions on two new friends i've met, and reading through it, reflecting back on it, makes me remember how far I've genuinely have come. 

Abandonment is a horrible thing to heal from. It's hard it sucks and it's painful and sometimes healing isn't for everyone. But the friends I have now, the ones I make, and the ones who stay with me, they make me feel less alone. And yes while I'll rehash old traumas and deal with the symptoms as they come, 

I can honestly say that life has been a lot better the more i continue my healing journey from bpd. 

And BPD is terminal. It can't be cured with anything. Therapy and medications and learning ways to make things easier and healthier for yourself through coping strategies may be the closest thing to a ""cure"" but it's a lot of hard work. 

it's hard work that I actively continue in order to keep healthy relationships, strong boundaries and honest communications with, because I deserve a chance to be happy and live a healthy life while living with BPD. 

So I guess if you're reading this, It's possible. It's possible to heal and to grow from the severity of it all. While it'll always be with you, You can find comfort in knowing that it's at least possible to ease the symptoms, to live a normal and healthy life style as Someone wBPD. So to whoever needed a sign to not give up and to see if it was possible, 

It is. 

Here's to the long progression of my own recovery, and all the beautiful places and people it will lead me to. 

And Here's to you, the reader.

 In the middle of these past 9 months, since a millennial moment sent me down this Maron rabbit hole, the biggest part that has hurt my heart is watching how easily a sexual predator has slid into a new market for himself, a market of the most vulnerable humans on earth.  A market where this man has children, little girls, drawing pictures of Mr. Snake, to send to a man who will misuse and exploit some of these same little girls sexually the moment they turn 18, and who will receive some illegal pictures from some of these girls while they are still underage,  pictures that he will not turn in to the FBI or to the parents/guardians of these girls.  And nobody is going to protect these children.  In many of my emails to Mr. Maron,  I mention these children he is only just within the past few years starting to target.  They are the most vulnerable sector of the human population, and this man is being given more and more access to them, being actively marketed to them.

Since April 26, I have been trying to bring this predator into a public light, and my biggest reason for doing this is to try my best to protect the little girls this man will one day sexually exploit and leave suicidal, like the girl with a gun who was pleading Mr. Maron to take her back, in public replies on his posts that would disappear as soon as she posted them, words telling him she loved him, begging him not to ignore and ghost her anymore, now that he was done with her.  This girl was 12 when Mr. Maron filmed his Thanksgiving book-reading for children, which gets played in schools across our country.  This girl was shown Mr. Maron was safe, at twelve, by having him publicly marketed to her as a child.  A few years later, this girl, a girl diagnosed with BPD, a sexualized child, a suicidal girl with a gun in her possession and on display in her Instagram photos, was in a very real crisis, because Mr. Maron was done using her, and he did not give a shit about her anymore.  I was hoping my public words might, at the very least, make Mr. Maron decide to back off his playing more and more for a child market.

In his WTF podcast today, Marc Maron makes it clear he is hoping for more appearances by Mr. Snake in the future, and is publicly enjoying  how he is reaching children.  It hurt my heart so much to hear his words today.  He knows exactly what he is doing, and he knows nobody cares enough about sexualized little girls to ever stop him.  He will be marketed to more children.  He is happy about that.

Victims of sexual exploitation do not need public exposure.  That is a fundamental truth for me.  But right now, it is taking everything in me to not insert a picture of this suicidal little girl right here in this blog post, along with pictures of her posts full of suicidal ideation, and a photo of the gun in her possession.  I know such pictures might have an actual impact on those reading this.  That is probably the one thing I could do right now that might actually protect future children from being sexually exploited by this predator.  How in the hell do I weigh the damage that would do, me putting that broken girl's photos here, against the damage Mr. Maron is going to do to those victims he will be exploiting and throwing aside in the future?  

The pain of this is horrible for me. 

There will be no pictures in this post.

There are children, this second, who will be future victims of Mr. Maron's.  Nobody is protecting them.

I just don't want help anymore, never thought I'd ever feel like this but I do. I mean the last time I self-harmed was 5 days ago my keyworkers know but anyway I just hate them all cause they trigger me too much!

I got an email saved in my draft that I don't want help anymore but I'm scared of making the wrong decision! especially because I do enjoy there company but sometimes they end up saying things that trigger me and I don't like that! keyworker told me to not blame her colleague for anything because shes a good person and doesn't deserve that even tho she clearly knows her keyworker triggered me. So when she said that I started bursting out crying and saying ""i hate you"" because if I can't blame her for hurting me then I'll just point at myself

Dealing with withdrawal sysmptoms,1685614254.0,"Hi all,

I've been taking Vortixotine (20mg) for a little over a year and my psychiatrist has decided to take me off my meds. 
This been 5 days and I am struggling, particularly with body feeling like I'm flu-ish and light-headedness
I have other symptoms which I've been given some meds to help with but the light-headedness and body aches I have no remedies for 

I tried Google but got nothing 

Does anyone have any recommendations on what I can do for relief?

PS- I've been told to eat a balanced diet and exercise both of which I do (I also work with a dietician so dketwose I know I'm good since I stick to plan). 

I have so much fatigue that I have bags under my eyes and redness in my eyes despite getting 8hours of sleep. I couldn't even work out this morning due to lack of energy

What if I was the problem…,1685590778.0,"So… I have been in several dysfunctional relationships in the past and pretty much always saw myself as the victim. And don’t get me wrong, I was badly hurt and affected by those; for years, some of the events were on replay in my head. The endless loop of despair and what-ifs and unmet needs from my caregivers who failed me spectacularly. Only I didn’t know at that time, I was just trying to survive.
Fast forward 15 years, hundreds of hours of therapy, and I finally realize that there are no villains and no victims, just hurt and faulty humans who made mistakes and that most of my hurt stemmed from misunderstandings rather than ill-intent.
I haven’t been the all-supportive, always kind, loving person that I insisted I was; I had been manipulative, pragmatic, deceitful and selfish. 
I was projecting and using many of my ego defenses to overcome the deep shame I was feeling, and I think I probably failed at honesty and some promises I should have never made.
I believed for decade and a half that I was the victim and powerless and that I was deprived of my chance at happiness because someone didn’t adore me enough.
In reality, none of that was ever true. I can analyze things 100x and make 101 things true in the process, but the core of the truth is that I am a trauma survivor who was in a tough situation and tried to make her fantasy of a novel parental figure/rescuer come true and completely ignored who people truly were in the process.
I discarded people immediately when they couldn’t meet my completely unrealistic expectations and be my living fantasies. Yet I blamed them for everything… 
Suddenly, at the likely half-point of my life, I am realizing I messed up and made poor choices and there’s nothing left but regret. 
Regrets and wondering what might have been… but finally I have no excuses and no finger to point.

Anyone else think they have schizophrenia aswell as BPD?,1685325784.0,"Schizophrenia runs quite heavily in my family. My dad had it, my grandfather had it extremely badly (ended his life because of it), my uncle also has it, and pretty much everyone on my dad's side and Abit on my mums side too. 

I definitely have had a lot of psychosis especially since I dabbled in mushrooms. Then my psychosis never went away ever again. But every psychiatrist I see in the public system doesn't seem to know much about it and just thinks it's part of my BPD. I hear voices and see animals and people and colors and full blown hallunations we're im not even here anymore. No one listens though and antipsychotics don't help for me. Whenever I experience trumua I just end up in a psychotic break again. Otherwise I'm fine and I learnt to live with it. But it appears that unless I get a experienced psychiatrist in schizophrenia, in which I can't afford, they will keep saying it's my BPD. But I've never had these symptoms before except for when I dabbled in mushrooms 6 years ago and I was never the same again. Which happens when genetic schizophrenia is laying doorment and you use drugs. They said that if I'm aware that I have schizophrenia then I can't have it. And I know that's incorrect for a fact. They told me ""it will go away in a few months"" but it's been 6 years and now they are just saying it's my BPD. Anyone else think this does not sound like my bpd?

But I’m still having dreams about him. Dreams where we reconcile, and he doesn’t hate me after all, and he just wants to be friends again, and so we are. Dreams where he cracks little jokes and tells me about his life and mentions how much he’s missed me.

My experience moving somewhere I didn't know anyone,1685251748.0,"As many of you can probably relate to, my life has been topsy turvy since a handful of awful things happened when I was a kid, and it's just been a rotating series of traumas ever since (not to sound self-indulgent, that's just how it's been unfortunately lol). Covid happened right as I was about to graduate, so I moved back in with my parents in my small town, and within the next few years I had a needlessly painful breakup with a man who put me through hell, had friends move away, was in and out of weird, formless friend groups, and of course had multiple scary moments within my family. I felt paralyzed, both by how expensive it was to move anywhere where I'm from, and from just being back in a familiar cycle of darkness. But the thing that really pushed me over the edge was when I watched my sweet dog, my best friend, die in an incredibly frightening way. 

Over the next few months, I plotted and realized if I stayed put any longer, I'd just go entirely numb and start to regress, and I'd lose the few close friends I still have. So I moved to a city I'd visited before, could afford with my new job, and felt comfortable in, despite not knowing anyone. I've been here for a couple months now, and it's definitely strange, but overall, it's been good. 

I've been forced to confront that inner, gnawing loneliness we go through, and ngl, it's been a motherfucker. Heavy melatonin and daily walks through the park have been lifelines lol. But it's also been really helpful. Sharing my experiences has allowed other people in my life to finally peek in, making me realize that the way I related to my loneliness was largely internal, and related to the traumas I still had to care for. I've been in a constant grind moving forward since I started DBT, feeling like I needed to ""prove"" I could handle myself, without really stopping to think what that means. Yes, it's painful to go multiple days without hearing from people I know, and to be in the world and see people with roots already established in this city. But I'm also more clear-headed than I've been in...fucking years, I don't even know lmao. 

When I cry, it's catharsis coming out. When I have a positive experience with a stranger, it's my light finally being brave enough to show its face again. I'm writing so much more, enough that I might be able to finally submit a portfolio somewhere (fingers crossed!). I'm not saying this is the path for everyone, but I wanted to share bc I know how scary it can be for us to imagine ourselves on our own. Hell, it takes constant work on my end to regulate myself and not let my inner fears and demons take the reins. But I feel myself growing, getting better, and even if this city isn't forever and I end up moving back to the city near my home, I'll still be that much more stronger, and secure in my solitude, instead of afraid of it.

I'm very calm. Sometimes to calm for my own good. But when he splits...he splits very quickly. Its rage when triggered. He will yell and blame me for things that are not my fault when he ""splits"". But otherwise he is a great partner.. Today we had a argument. I let him have a hour or two space and then came to talk to him.. he started disrespecting me and getting very mad again and treating me badly. He said he was being triggered by me and needed more time. I should have just walked away, but i didn't. I stayed and calmly tried to explain myself while he was yelling over me and blaming me. He then got up and pushed the door closed while I was behind and still talking to him while it was half open. He did it so fast and hard on me that it bumped my head and now I have a lump on it. I told him off for it. But since he was already triggered, he just lost it completely and said it is my fault and then slammed the front door and said it was over. I haven't seen him since. He said not to contact him. I told him not to come back until he goes to the mental health ward in the hospital and talk things through with them. I told him I don't feel comfortable with him coming back until then. He  replied a few hours later saying his at the hospital.  He just started seeing a therapist too, to help him with his anger. But I also understand that he has poor impulse control of his emotions and I should have walked away when he told me to. Though this doesn't excuse his behavior. None of it does. I just don't know what to do. His had a really bad childhood and his last relationship was really abusive too, so he often gets triggered. But he wants to change. And knows it's a problem when he is clear headed and not feeling mad or fustrated.  He is also withdrawaling off weed which his been smoking for years and years. I don't know who's at wrong here or if it's both of us to some degree. I should have walked away when he said he needed the space. And he shouldn't have done it regardless. It's not black and white. Sometimes relationships are much more complex and shades of grey then most are quick to assume. Do you think this is something we can overcome with continued threapy and hard work ?

An important issue often faced by those diagnosed with BPD,1684810903.0,"I am 57, and over the last 43 years, I have been diagnosed with a number of mental health issues stemming from an abusive childhood.  There is something disturbing that has happened to me since I was 13, and was first encouraged by my sda school principal to try doing some ""counseling "" with him.  He turned the counseling sessions into times he could sexually misuse me, something I have come to refer to as ""sexual re-exploitation.""  This has happened so many times to myself and to others with histories like mine, but the only discussions I have ever come across about this subject have referred to this as ""transference,"" and the client, not the therapist, usually receives the blame.  Once, when I was 27, a minister who was counseling/screwing me told me something I didn't quite comprehend, but years later, when I finally caught on, it bothered me a lot.  He said the preacher who had trained him for the clergy, had told him the best sex he would ever have would be whenever he got to counsel girls with certain mental health issues.  I have felt a growing disturbance in myself over the last decade, as I started to recognize how often predators are purposely targeting those of us with certain mental health issues, and seem to focus on BPD the most.  The damage this does to people already dealing with so many issues is awful.  I have been blogging about this specific issue recently, and felt that others like myself might be interested in learning how to recognize these specific predatory words and behaviors, so we can all better protect ourselves, and also learn to speak up about those who choose harm people with serious mental and emotional issues.  I feel strongly that those of us who have made it to our 40's or 50's or older, need to start speaking up about this issue, in order to better protect younger people dealing with BPD, or any other mental health struggles.

Here is the link to what I have recently been learning, regarding this subject.  All posts from April 26 forward are descriptions of my current battle, and discoveries, regarding the misuse of those with BPD:

I haven't learned how to set proper boundaries or pick a healthy partner. Sick of being abused...,1684337902.0,"I was posting comments on BPD and making posts on BPDrecovery recently about wanting help for self sabotage because my partner at the time had me convinced all our relationship struggles were due to my BPD. All this while he would threaten to call the cops on me if I raised my voice even though he would consistently scream over me during disagreements, would insist I wear freshly washed clothes to bed every night even though he washes his hair once a month, punched me in the stomach to 'show me a cool Kung Fu move' even though he knows my stomach is in horrible shape after having a C Diff infection a few months ago, locked me out of the house, and more. He's got a PhD and a house so I thought he would be a stable good person. But he wasn't. The relationship ended last week with me moving out after calling the cops on him for domestic violence because he physically kicked me out of the bed for asking to turn the thermostat up a few degrees.

I can't believe he had me convinced that just because he was the one to cook dinner, had said he wanted to marry me, and had insisted he was trying to help me, and offered me a room to rent in his house, that it somehow made up for the abuse.

How could I let this happen to myself? How could I excuse his abuse time and time again? Most of my relationships have been with guys who consistently cross my boundaries and guilt me constantly if I don't do what they say and condescendingly act like they're saints for 'putting up with how emotional' I am. I thought I had learned to love and accept myself finally in the past few years. Yet I keep ending up in toxic relationships. I'm in my 30s now and went through DBT twice so why still? I'm so so confused...

How Did You Know You Have BPD?,1684153800.0,"Hello! 👋🏻

TL;DR: I'm a chronic overthinker. I'm not asking to be diagnosed or even necessarily what anyone here thinks I am or am not -- I'm asking how you realized you have BPD, especially if you suspected (or knew) before diagnosis.

I met a friend of mine about three years ago, and when he told me that he had BPD, I started doing research on it. That research led me to the realization that *another* friend of mine most definitely has it (not diagnosed, at least not yet, but if you meet all criteria, ya know).

Having a (disorganized attachment)[https://www.healthline.com/health/parenting/disorganized-attachment], there are naturally elements to BPD that I can understand and apply to my own life.

More and more recently though, and especially when I hear people talk about their experiences with quiet BPD, I find myself relating to very nearly everything.

Which, ya know, makes a person wonder. I went through this same thing when I first wondered if I had autism, and then again when I wondered about OCD.

So, was there anything (or a bunch of things) that made you realize that this is what you have? Or was it an immediate realization upon hearing symptoms?",General_Ad7381,,False,13i6vf1,3,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/13i6vf1/how_did_you_know_you_have_bpd/

"Is it normal to stop being so ""lovey dovey"" when you move in together?",1684008995.0,"Moved in with my partner and he unfortunately recently got fired from his job. Since then bring under the same roof so much has made him become emotionally more distant. We have been living together about a month now but I can't work due to my health so we are no always around eachother even if we are in separate rooms it still feels smoothering.

Now it's about rent, bills, what needs to be done, or what have you. Anything that needs to be communicated.

Should I be concerned?,1683955962.0,"
I'd like to preface this post by stating that I have toxic behaviors in the relationship, such as invading space, being overly critical, heavy splitting, not listening to his side well, as well as my own yelling and general outbursts. I am in therapy partly to work on these behaviors.  
  
My bf does have some behaviors of his own that bother me, however I'm not sure if some of these are normal and I'm just splitting when I freak out about them. I've communicated about most of these and I've noticed some of it get better, however he's also told me he feels like I take everything as a personal attack and like I don't trust him. Sometimes when conflict has been very heated and I point out something that bothered me, he corrects it but explains he feels like he needs to keep a 'checklist"" of bad words/things to say. The behaviors that have been bothering me are:  
  
\-Swearing during conflict, but I've even corrected him when it isn't directed at me  
  
\-Yelling, he's also explained much of the time he does not mean to yell directly at me, but I have noticed it improve over time.  
  
\-Sometimes when we disagree he says what I said was ""stupid"", I've tried asking him to change it to say that what I'm saying doesn't make sense or something more neutral. I have noticed this get better as well, but he does get frustrated about it at times and doesn't always know how else to describe something  
  
\-Saying what I said was ""useless"", but this is often when I've repeated the same questions over and over or don't add anything to the conversation. He has gotten better about it but also does get frustrated about needing to stop.  
  
\-Saying that I'm being stupid/am stupid, however this has only been when I've highly bothered him and wouldn't give him space during the argument. He's only said this when I've split very hard and have had a giant episode where I won't let him calm down, so he likely does this because he doesn't feel like he has a choice. He does want to work on it, but I understand I provoke it and don't give him much of a chance to act differently.  
  
\-A few times he's hit things, such as the couch or his desk, but this is also often when I won't give him space when he's asked. He has thrown his phone once or twice when I was splitting very hard on him as well, but I've also done this to my phone much more. He's never thrown anything in my direction or near me, and I don't feel like he's trying to intimidate me.  
  
He does know these behaviors bother me, and when things are calm and we try to problem solve again after escalation he usually apologizes and wants to be better. However, sometimes he will say that I took some of it personally, such as swearing. Another thing that concerns me is that during arguments when I ask him not to call me stupid, he'll say ""I didn't call you stupid, I said you were being stupid."", I've read from some people that these things are forms of gaslighting, but I also know I provoke some of it after crossing his boundaries, and that BPD can often make us overreact so I am looking for input.  
  
Many of these things didn't start until I split on him more, however the yelling, swearing, and some moments of him saying I'm taking stuff personally did, as well as saying what I say in arguments at times is ""useless"".  
  
I've been bringing up couples therapy, now that our lives are less busy he said he'll try going. Going is very out of his comfort zone, as he's had trauma around therapists and doesn't think couples therapy is effective, but he said he'll try once a month then see if he's okay going more often. He's also told me if he can't figure out his behaviors on his own he'll try to see a therapist himself. For the couples therapist, he has said he doesn't want to do much of the work of looking for one, but it was my idea so I'm not sure if this is fair.  
  
We were trying to call each other out on these behaviors during conflict and then taking a break before re-engaging, but I've often failed at following through as I've explained. I am in no way trying to excuse my toxic actions. I'm just asking if his behavior seems like a valid reaction to my splitting and how I act, or if I should be concerned and he seems toxic as well.",thelittlestone568,,False,13g8f5z,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/13g8f5z/should_i_be_concerned/
BPD/EUPD Support Group! <3,1683937068.0,"My name is Daisy Sky (she/her) and I am a Couples & Family Therapist in training! Nice to meet you, fellow BPD brains <3

I will be offering a 12-session support group for those who struggle with borderline personality disorder/emotionally unstable personality disorder this summer! This group is for you if you have trouble regulating your emotions, you struggle in your interpersonal relationships, you find yourself making impulsive and potentially destructive decisions (do they even feel like decisions??), you have an unstable sense of identity, and/or you find yourself frequently ruminating on the past or future. This group is also for you if you have a loved one who is struggling with these symptoms. While the group is centered around the struggles of those with BPD/EUPD, you do not need to identify with this condition to be welcome in the space.

Group will be held on Zoom from 7:00-8:30pm PST on Wednesdays, dates listed below. In group, I will share a new skill each week, and open up space for sharing and discussion. This group is NOT a substitute for therapy, rather a supplemental peer support space. I have been managing EUPD for over a decade, and I have lots of resources and compassion to share with those whose lives have been touched by this painful condition 📷 Influences will be drawn from my own personal therapy, as well as teachings from my MACFT program. I will be drawing from evidence-based treatments for BPD, and this group will have a strong mindfulness component, with recommended weekly journaling/practice assignments. Please share with anyone who you think would benefit; I think it's going to be a beautiful space!

Energy exchange/financial support is negotiable on a sliding scale, with discounts given to those who sign up for the entire series, BIPOC, and trans folx. NOTAFLOF! Drop-ins are also welcome! If you would like to have your camera off and remain anonymous, that is also completely acceptable, and we will have group agreements regarding communication and confidentiality. Sessions will not be recorded.

Trauma comparison,1683660851.0,"Hello everyone

tw: vent

I've been struggling these past few weeks comparing my trauma to others. This never used to affected me before, my family used to say to me all the time that they had it worse than me and i should be grateful for it, but still this never got into my head. All the time i used to think that i will never be able to minimize my trauma or struggles because what matters is how that affected me.

Somehow now i do worry about it. My partner/fp makes me feel like this and i feel guilty and horrible. On the other hand they are a shitty fp and make me suffer so much but i don't choose this either, even tho they know i have bpd they still do things that make me feel miserable or bad. I love them so much and i want to spend my life with them but other times i hate them and i want them to die (i know it's not right) and break up. I want to break up btw, they are toxic, but i need them, i don't know what to do without them (i hate this).

Anyways, what i'm trying to say is that i think that other people had it worse than me and that i'm just dramatic (as i said many people used to say this to me, but never got into my head, now it does). This makes me feel like shit, need to cry/sh or whatever. it frustrates me so much, i want to get it out of my head and stop thinking about it. Everytime i am calm then it suddenly think it again, i can't stop thinking about it. 

The other day i watched a video about a psychologist talking about this topic and it made me feel better for a while, everyones feelings are valid no matter what they went through, if it affected you it's important. That lasted two hours, and again this thoughts came back 

I am writing this as an ask of help or if u want to share something too. 

If you ever had this thoughts how did you manage to control them? to affect you less? to stop thinking about it? to stop feeling guilty or bad? to make them dissapear?

If you share your experiences or how you got through them i would be so grateful, i know you get me and i need help or an advice if u can give it.

Please  i am desperate for help, any kind of advice, etc helps.

I hit my ab*sive partner in a argument..,1683652298.0,"TW: relationship psyical/mental/sexual abuse and childhood abuse

Quick backstory, I have never been psyical to anyone before. But the last two relationships I've been in I have. Including the last one it has now been 3 times in total. My last relationship was incredibly mentally, emotionally, and psychologically abusive along with sexually. I'd wake up to him doing things to me when I told him multiple times not to. This relationship I'm in now is mostly psychological, mental, and emotional. The ones before were sexually and psyically abusive. Why so many abusive relationships? I had a very long childhood were I was hurt daily sexually by a family member for 10 years. Then I saw my mother constantly in abusive relationships. Even after years of threapy I still end up back in these situations sometimes. But I am getting better at leaving alot sooner. My last relationship it's like something snapped. All the years of abuse in my past bulit up and I could not handle it anymore. I was psyical with them on one occasion even though they weren't psyical with me.(in a abusive way e.g. hit them/pushed them ) After that I never did it to them again.  And in no healthy relationship have I ever felt anywhere near this way before ether. I never felt a loss of control or that I was losing my mind. 

Now with my current partner we both have bpd. But I am like a mouse. I am rarely angry or raise my voice. I do not question him out of fear for how mad he gets. He is mentally very very abusive but not psyically. Yesterday I told him not to yell or I would walk away. I stood up to him for once. This made him much much madder. It went on for awhile and I was tired of being told horrible things and constantly having to bow down to him and not say anything. I told him I will snap and do something I will regret if he doesn't stop yelling and degrading me right now. That I am not in control right now. I tried to exit the room and he followed me and put his face right up close to mine were it was touching and proceeded to yell and yell and after multiple warnings he kept telling me to hit him and then saying awful things to me. I then punched him in the eye. I went to call police and he wrestled the phones out of my hand. So I feel awful right now for hitting him. I honestly do and it's not in my personality to do this. There's a certain point I can no longer tolerate mentally. I know what I did was bad and inexcusable. We are both still in therapy. He does individual and we both do couples.  I am aware I need to leave him but right now it's much more involved then some would think as we brought a home together and we split bills/loans etc and right now I'm just working on a plan to leave but it takes time. 


Regardless, I just feel I am a monster in this instance. He was not psyical to me but I was to him. I don't deserve him. But I am still in shock and dissociation that this happened. I guess I just needed to vent. I don't expect anyone to be understanding. I don't think I'm deserving of any credit here or anything, I just really needed to talk and vent right now.

Anyone Else Sometimes Miss Old Symptoms?,1683651616.0,"So recently I've discovered as I work through certain symptoms a lot of times they don't really bother me anymore

like I no longer deal with any sort of favorite person syndrome because I worked really hard on it and no longer feel that 'need' for another person

but sometimes I miss that feeling like it wasn't always bad as much as I had extreme lows of missing my FP / being triggered/ abandonment issue flare ups/ etc. I feel like I was also capable of feeling a stronger, more passionate kind of love that I'm just not capable of anymore. Like of course if you feel like your world is literally going to end if your relationship w your FP ends you're going to have a stronger love for them but it sometimes feels like I just don't love my current BF as past partners cause I don't have panic attacks because I'm so scared of him leaving me.

Is this something anyone else has experienced? It happens with other symptoms sometimes as well where I'm glad the negatives are gone but I also miss the positives. Like I don't wanna go back but I miss the highs too. And sometimes I even miss the lows. Like I miss just feeling those super strong feelings- like I've been dulled down a little now.

Do you have problems like this?,1683569757.0,"Okay, so I’m writing here because I’ve got no where else to go. I mean, I’ve got my treatment down, psychiatrist and therapist (got an appointment soon), but I just wanted to ask other people with bipolar and BPD (I’ve got diagnosed as both) if they feel the same. 

A little bit over a month ago I was making playful sexual jokes with my boyfriend, or maybe I should say at my boyfriend. We were at a Walmart, I wasn’t being loud. He said he would get me a “big point hat” because I was too stupid to understand how to behave in america (I’m a legal immigrant). After that he asks dms politely to stop and said I was making him uncomfortable, and I stopped. It wasn’t the first time he called me stupid or “special” (in a derogatory way).  We talked about it and he stopped since, although I caught him almost doing it a few times, I give him credit for not doing it. 

Another thing that happens often is when people ask me “how am I doing?” And I describe graphically how I would end myself. Not because i want to do it, I got suicide hotline saved on my phone. I just feel so bad that the description is how I feel, and saying “sad” is not enough; I’m not sad, I’d be sad if a cup broke, and that’s often not the case. 

I got so many people criticizing me and how I talk that I’m simply stopping, lying when I’m *sad* and acting *normal* so everyone around me feels better, but it feels wrong. I have a filter problem, it’s funny sometimes, but it can be inconvenient and uncomfortable at other times. People don’t want the whole me, they want the *quirky bipolar* me. This makes me feel truly sad, like a little kid being yelled at and not knowing why.

New to BPD,1683094250.0,"So I guess this is sort of my introduction, as im new and just exploringmy support options. I'm a 28F and married with 3 kids. I know the all the hate I'll get for this, but I haven't been clinically diagnosed yet, atm I'm still learning about bpd and collecting all the evidence to bring to my doctor so I can start the process of being diagnosed. 


Now that that's outta the way, let's start from the beginning. My mental issues, as it pertains to bpd, started manifesting when I was 9 after my parents split up. My parents were both abusive in different ways, mom is a narcissist and dad liked to beat us, but my siblings and I didn't know that our lives were all that bad because we didn't know any better. That was until the divorce... it was still pretty taboo to have divorced parents back then, so the schools put us in group counciling and that's when we started realizing everything. 


The divorce didn't make anything better tho, and as the years went on, everything compounded until I finally had a melt down. At 14 I was caught with razor blades on school campus, but the felt I was more of a threat to others than myself and I was sent to an alternative school for 3mos. When I got bk I basically told the school therapist I was going to keep mutilating myself bc no one cared enough to stop me. That's when I was finally hospitalized and diagnosed with ""severe depression with anxiety"". 3yrs later, that diagnosis changed to ""manic depression with severe anxiety"". I was on every medication you could think of, but nothing helped or lasted very long... my emotions have always been a daily rollercoaster for me and it was difficult to control.


At 19 I got pregnant with my first kid, I took preemptive steps on ppd. But all that did was delay the inevitable, and that was the last time I took any medication for my issues and started self medicating. I was doing pretty good until at 23, I lost what would have been my second kid. I spiraled for months after that, but even after it stopped I was still never as good as I was b4. Then at 25 I got pregnant again, and that's where things started getting really bad again. I didn't try to take meds during that time and the ppd hit me harder than the first time, even still as bad as I was, I still felt like I was handling it all very well... but 9mos later I was pregnant again and tht just turbo charged the spiral.


I knew my issues weren't normal and that I was worse than I had ever been b4 in my life, so I started doing research. Instead of focusing on past diagnosis, I researched all of my symptoms which I'll list off now.

☆ constant daily rollercoaster of emotions
☆various manifestations of paranoia
☆having different ""personalities"" for different people I interact with
☆hopelessness
☆self hate 
☆unstable relationships
☆inability to hold a job for more than 9mos
☆feeling like I'm not in control of my self or actions
☆impulsive habits
☆blackout rages
☆hyper fixation with new relationships 
☆saying things I don't mean
☆feeling lost
☆terrified of abandonment
☆feeling out of place or time
☆disassociating 
☆hearing/seeing things that aren't there
☆seething jealousy 
☆acute distrust, even with people close to me


Really I could go on and on, the point is that I came across bpd and everything just clicked. So I along with all of my research, I started listening to other people's stories and their struggles and it just solidified it all for me. I meet 7 out of 9 criteria points, and so I'm 99% sure that this is what my problems all stem from. Really, the only thing that's really stopping me from going to my doctors with all of this, is my distrust of the medical industry. I don't know how to approach the subject without sounding like I'm crazy or overreacting. I've had past professionals claim nothing is wrong and tht I'm just attention seeking, it's not often I'm ever taken seriously.

I want to stop being abusive,1682913711.0,"Title. 

I've struggled with severe mental health issues for years and had a very abusive upbringing (religious trauma, absent parents, constant guilting, parentification, and criticism). As a note, my partner is very disabled and I'm their caregiver, and them being disabled is a good part because of my abuse.

In my current relationship of 6 years I've been abusive for almost 5 , and the last 9 months I had been doing a really good job. I knew I was abusive and was working with my partner to ensure that they feel safe. Before that, I didn't realise how bad my mental health problems were, and I didn't see my actions as abusive. Things came to a head in summer 2021 and I took some steps to do better, but shit hit the fan and I ended up living in our car for 6 months to give them some space. June 2022 I got my shit together and started doing self-directed DBT (I had no money for therapists), and things went really well after that, I even shared with some friends my past and they were helping me get better (before they started to abuse my partner, so I cut ties with them). After that I was doing perfect. Except in January, some really stressful things happened, and it's been a slow decline ever since.

It started as occasional lies that were super obvious. Then, in late February I had a complete mental health breakdown. Afterward I started being more defensive and argumentative, and recently it's become a daily occurrence.

I realise that I was trying to ignore what was happening instead of just radically accepting my behaviour and trying to fix it, but I need help. I finally have some money, so I reached out to some therapists that had been recommended to me some months ago, and I want to fix my behaviour. But honestly, I don't know what to do and if this will even help. I keep falling back into the same old abusive habits, and I have no support network other than my partner. I can't even find resources online to help me, the closest thing has been support groups for men that have been sent there for domestic violence.

What do I do when my partner gets triggered?,1682778205.0,"Before I start this I just want to say that BOTH of us suffer BPD. However, the difference is, I have done a lot of work and I no longer feel I fit the diagnosis nor react or feel or show any symptoms or BPD much at all anymore. I'm now in my 30s and was diagnosed very young. 

My partner has not had much treatment and is easily triggered and reactive. I do walk on eggshells util we see a psychologist because we are on a waiting list to see a couple and individual therapist. 

Im just having trouble with the emotional stress it's putting on me when he splits. Especially because I suffer seizures and trumua which is triggered by stress. He changes completely it's like night and day. And then he just threatens to leave me atleast twice a week and threatens suicide to make me feel bad instead of just owning upto his actions its always a victim mentality. You can't talk sense into him while his like this. He just gets worse and worse and pushes me away more and more unless I show affection towards him and then he will slowly let down his guard. But in that highly stressful moment I'm not feeling like being affectionate or loving towards him because it's not cool what his doing. He doesn't stop and if I ignore him he sees it as abandonment and gets more upset. But when he calms down his able to finally apologize. To a degree. He never used to be able to do that so it's been a big step for him. When his completely calm he now realizes he needs help and this can't continue. But I need advice on what to do when he gets like that. Being stern or telling him to stop makes it worse. But so does being silent. He is incredibly giving and nice when he is not triggered but when he is it's like a completely different person who says things about me and others he never normally would. He sees the world and everyone in it so drastically different when he is in this space and he even sounds Abit psychotic because sometimes it doesn't even make sense what his ranting on about. We live together and I have come accustom to how his mind works and he has told me he is sick of living like this. But in the meantime I need to find a plan so we can both remain sane when he starts getting triggered. Because he refuses to say his mad or triggered while his triggered and can take offense to it. Whilist I need a way to isolate until his calm. I also wanted to know why he keeps breaking up with me because I never have threatened that before even though I have BPD. I never completely understood it. It's like he wants me to beg him to stay or else he wants to leave. I feel it's unfair.

I feel like my partner has been manipulative since I was diagnosed and I don't want this to affect my recovery.,1682737623.0,"To preface this, I intend to have a discussion with my therapist regarding this issue but I'd like some insight if this is a situation I need to remove myself from asap. 


My partner and I broke up about a month ago shortly after my BPD got worse and I was cycling through emotions every other hour. I started therapy and it has worked tremendously well. A couple of days ago, he came by and explained that he'd like to give this another try once I have sorted out my issues and he has his career together. Btw, we had been living together and he has moved to a place nearby. 


I love this new space we have to work on ourselves. I am working out, focusing on my studies and hobbies like never before. However, there have been a few instances where I'm wondering if he is subconsciously using my diagnosis against me recklessly. 


For example, he dropped by pretty late last night and was about to head back home to study. I was heading to bed anyway so I suggested he bring his materials over to study here since it was so late and he looked tired. He immediately went on the attack. ""Babe you are regressing, you are going back into the loop"". I was so taken aback, I was on the verge of tears. This recovery process has not been easy and it was very hurtful that he could throw my diagnosis at my face when I was just being kind. 


This isn't the first time this has happened. I assumed he is quite level headed and one of the few stable people I know. But the current dynamic feels very one sided. Although I'd like to be supportive of him while he achieves his goals, this behaviour of telling me I'm regressing or that I need to get a handle on my emotions for very normal kindnesses that couples show each other has left me with a sour taste in my mouth. 


He drops by unannounced all the time which I was okay with since he needs a break from his studies but he seems to think he is entitled to receive/show affection however he wants to while I'm the one walking on eggshells around him.

Passed the Bar Exam Today,1682697089.0,"At the risk of seeming egotistical, I (29M) wanted to post this for anybody really going through it as proof that you can do that thing people say you can’t do because you’re borderline.

I’ve had a lifelong struggle with what I know now to be Borderline Personality Disorder. In highschool, I was bullied so aggressively I had multiple near death experiences and my family’s home was repeatedly vandalized. My dad was repeatedly battling advanced stage cancer and I had to take care of my brother through the end of highschool while struggling with what I know to be CPTSD now. I was (mistakenly) diagnosed bipolar, PTSD, and anxiety when I was 18 and told I would need to live a low-stress, safe, low pressure lifestyle. I hated this. 

For years, through college I struggled with both being over-medicated while also being inadequately helped. I hungout with dangerous, aggressive people through college because that level of dysfunction felt normal. I graduated college with a double major, but struggled to function well in the workplace. Bad relationships with toxic people was all I knew.

I spent 5 years in a majorly abusive relationship with a toxic narcissist that resulted in multiple hospital trips for stitches and broken glass removal. When that ended, I was a law student and the stress of the breakup led to lots of psychiatric problems, the vast majority of my friends abandoning me, isolation, suicide attempts, and self harm. I had to drop out of law school twice. My CPTSD and providers’ mismanagement of meds was so extreme that I lost the ability to read for almost 18 months. But I graduated.

I wasn’t even able to take the bar exam when I wanted to- my law school made me join a disciplinary program designed for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems because of my mental health problems through law school due to the extreme stigma against mental illness in law. I had to delay taking the bar exam after graduating because my mental illness was regarded as “a danger to the public.” Joining that punitive program was the only way to convince my state licensure board I could be trusted.

Finally, I was diagnosed BPD and started to get better through DBT. DBT saved my life. I gained the skills to put myself back together. Today I have an amazing girlfriend, a nice small house, rescue pitbull, new friends (through my girlfriend) and a couple old friends that stood by me, and now a new career in law as an attorney in a mid size American city as of finding out I passed the bar just this morning. 

Never let this illness hold you back. We are more than a DSM line item. Borderline isn’t a death sentence or a scarlet letter or a reason to give up- it’s an opportunity to defy expectations, to take hold of life despite obstacles, to seize a life worth living in a world that tells us we don’t deserve it. Do that thing everybody says you can’t do and tell anyone who tries to stop you to eat shit.

Do people with BPD treat the person they love the most the absolute worst out of everybody?,1682442673.0,"lI have been in a relationship with this girl for 6 years. She is the love of my life but she has mistreated me in every sense possible since the start. I tried my best to be patient but I am losing my ability to. Everything you can do wrong to your significant other in a relationship she has done to me (cheating, violence, manipulation and everything in between). I forgive her every time because I know she is dealing with BPD. One day she loves me even tho theres “something missing” (even tho that something missing is unhealed trauma. She needs to fill that void for us to have a stronger connection) and then the next day she hates me and wants nothing to do with me. 

The story of her upbringing is the worst Ive ever heard from someone I personally know. Everybody in her life mistreats her. From her family to her “ex” who she still thinks of because he was a narcissist and used her/played her to get what he wanted. I learned the NPD/BPD tie is horrible. Her family allowed horrific things to happen to her that include sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. I am at the point where I’m about to give up.

We have a 4 year old son together so I’m trying to save our family. The hardest part is she treats literally everybody else in her life amazingly. Her friends, her fucked up family, coworkers. Literally everybody gets amazing treatment from her but she constantly mistreats me all the time. I don’t understand. I have been nothing but loving, loyal, forgiving, understanding, compassionate and everything in between. I love her and want her to get better. She is contemplating starting treatment and I have been trying to push her to go. I read somewhere people with BPD treat the person they love the most the absolute worst. Is that true? 

I know she loves me deep down. I know in her core of cores deep within her spirit she loves me and wants to be with me. I’m not delusional. But she keeps pushing me away and pulling me back and mistreating me and I’m tired. I don’t know what else I can do. Please help. I love her with all my heart she is the love of my life.

I am so confused - vent,1681991416.0,"
So, I’m strung over two poles of what I might have, NPD or BPD, because I’m dealing with an individual who has narcissistic traits, and the gaslighting is making me delve more into introspection and doubt. I’ve been told by my psychiatrist that he sees some BPD traits, but didn’t want to label me as it because he didn’t know how much of it was also a result of my toxic trauma bond.

Everything ovjectively about our relationship points to me having BPD; I stumbled across “FP” due to another user shedding light on it, and the dick pics I put up on my story for her to see and clinginess shit was because she was pulling away the second time around after I confessed I felt for her (she ghosted me one before for three months, said it was because she was struggling with some issues - tells me it’s my clinginess now when I ask her). 

God, she called me a “validation-seeking asshole”, YEAH, I fucking am? I want you to fucking love me like you once did, like you SAID you did. I kept making alts to text you after you blocked me because you blocked me and then kept coming back, before fucking blocking me again because I was “threatening suicide”, yet when you were suicidal, you lavished in the paragraphs of text I sent you telling you not to?? What the fuck?

Now I always fucking come back to text you because I feel bad - I feel like I’m due to apologize to you, because I can’t have you feel like I’m hating you as you move on like we never even existed, because I hope one day you’ll come back, but a decent part of me doesn’t want you back?? People say I’m the narcissist, so why do I have your fucking name tattooed on my arm? I DO sometimes have ego trips, and I DO sometimes feel like I’m using people to feel happier so I can heal from the hurt of the shit you put me through, but at the same time I also feel drained and compelled to help peiple, compelled to listen and talk to them to help them, but that doesn’t really work out well, because then I also rely on them to be my “therapists”. 

I also ghost people I text for a while because I can’t deal with this when I’m in a shitty position, because I’m DRAINED like a PornHub hunk. I don’t, however, view myself as going back to them to use something frok them; I just feel bad for having them wait on “delivered” for so long. 

Why do I live my life like you’re watching me - I always have to wear an exaggerated persona because one of your new “friends” keeps lurking around on games we all played, watching my every words and talking shit about me to try and get a rise out of me? 

My empathy levels also fluctuate - like, when I feel like a dick that’s super fucking grandiose (usually when people criticize me, though most of these are genuinely uninformed and just downright intentional, it seems), I’m Stalin. Zero empathy. But then there are times when my empathy is there, especially if there’s a trigger, like a song, that makes me FEEL.

I don’t see myself as YOU - we’re different; I don’t like hurting people first, unlike you. I don’t want to be a burden to people, unlike you, who says you “don’t want to be seen as a less than”. I HATE the thought of being manipulative, and try to overcompensate for this by pleasing, by being a cuck.

I stalked you, of-fucking-course, Instagram and Facebook helped me self-harm:

(A message I sent a friend when I saw my sister’s toy in front of me as I was reading “Totem and Taboo)

“I can't.
Even
Fucking look at toys of my little sister
Why? The ultimately make me think of how
""baby (your name) had toys"", and how I hurt that baby with my words and actions, and I'm on a guilt trip now
I can't fucking focus on the book
I have this urge to go to her mom's profile on
FB and look at pictures of baby (your name) to feel even worse about what I did”

Is it me or BPD?,1681900119.0,"Hi guys, I'm a therapist with BPD and have written this post for work about a struggle I think a lot of us can relate to. Hope it helps some people ❤️ please feel free to let me know what you think, if you can relate, and if you have found something else that has worked for you

\-

For those of us who grew up in invalidating environments, our realities and experiences were often denied. This may have looked like a caregiver telling us to “stop being so sensitive” or saying “it’s not a big deal”. As children we learn that we can not trust our own internal experiences and this sense of distrust within ourselves remains with us in adulthood. 

After I was diagnosed with BPD, this feeling intensified as I started to question whether my reactions were valid or if it was my “disorder”. This was harmful because I began justifying other people’s toxic behaviours and using my diagnosis as an excuse to justify & rationalise my own unhealthy behaviours. Having my personality labelled as “disordered” reinforced my self-distrust.

Now when I experience intense emotional reactions, rather than telling myself “It’s my BPD talking” and dismissing my experience-

* I remind myself that my emotions are always valid. (This doesn’t mean that my actions are always okay).
* I give myself time and space to feel calmer, which may involve going on a walk, taking a shower or journalling.
* When I’m feeling calmer, which can sometimes take days, I take the time to think about the situation from different perspectives and come to a wise mind conclusion or decision (this is easier said than done and has taken lots and lots of practice).
* I also remind myself that sometimes I won’t have an answer, make the right decision or do the thing that’s most helpful, and that’s okay. I am still human, I will make mistakes and that’s okay.

When we practice putting space between our big feelings and our reactions, and take the time to try and look at all sides of a situation, the message we send ourselves is “I trust myself and my ability to handle difficult situations”. This practice can help us move towards repairing the relationship we have with ourselves and our inner world.",Jembaby24,,False,12rolri,36,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/12rolri/is_it_me_or_bpd/

Should I continue with this therapist?,1681824274.0,"
Hello, guys! I am attending scheme therapy, and for the most part we’ve been doing a simple version of the Recognizing your emotions worksheet from the DBT workbook (what happened, when, how did it make you feel etc.). It happened a few times that the therapist interrupted me in the middle of my sentence/ chain of thought, and today I finally asked them if I could finish my sentence (bc unspoken words leave me with a weird feeling in my chest), and they said they interrupted me because I wanted to prove with a negative past experience why something is not possible, instead of focusing on the future outcome, when in fact I just wanted to mention another maladaptive pattern of mine, and it wasn’t obvious to me they already knew that, they could tell. 

When we explore a maladaptive scheme, I think I feel the need to justify it, to explain my reasons behind my actions, why I feel the way I do, and they called this arguing, because when they say it’s a maladaptive thought, they expect me to accept it right away, and move on. It kinda terrifies me that my brain is so rigid, and that I didn’t see a problem with my response, cause they are right, I am there because I need to change my approach to certain situations, and they no something that I don’t, but it feels impossible to me to just accept what they say without going into detailed explanations. And they stop me, because they know and understand how I feel, and it’s not important, we need to change the scheme,  I might be dumb, but it’s not obvious to me that the other person know what I feel, so I don’t try to argue, I just try to paint the whole picture of my interior world. How could I make my brain more flexible?

I think this therapy could work, because it’s so different from what I am used (overanalyzing every emotion and situation, and constantly trying to find the root of everything), and my way didn’t take me far, so I thought this “action taking” approach could actually help. But my therapist said we might not be compatible, if I question everything, and don’t trust their knowledge, and they like to move faster, we should have achieved something by now, instead of going over my same emotions.

Now I have this weird feeling inside me, like I hesitate to talk about stuff.

Over some men degrading me because I'm still single at age 30,1681564933.0,"(SOME) men, nowadays but especially recently, have become horrible to talk to about any issue at all, simply because I'm a woman or the issue is about a woman. I am 30 now and turning 31 soon. I still have no kids of my own and no partner. My relationships never last long because they have almost always been abusive. Ether psyically, sexually, verbally, emotionally, and mentally. I was also abused heavily as a child for many years too. And watched my mother get abused in abusive relationships also. So I cut them off when I start seeing signs of abuse now. So this nothing lasts long at all. Maybe 6-8months? Often less. But no guy listens they think there is something wrong with me even if I tell them I was abused. They think it's justified or something. I FEEL Men nowadays just don't care about women at all. And it is scary. I went to the doctor and I was told I am to infertile for IVF and I don't meet criteria for adoption without a partner. I made a post with only my closest friends on fb could see it, and all the men just blamed me as to why I don't have a partner by now or kids. And that no guy will want me and will think there is something wrong with me now. And honestly it is true. Every date I go on now, I'm heavily questioned what I did wrong to still be single... It didn't used to be this bad to date but recent years with social media, guys are acting emotionally abusive constantly in videos and it's being praised and considered ""normal"". I picked two comments from my post I can show but obviously I can't show them all. I feel I can only talk to my therapist. I feel I'm always to blame or it's always my fault. I blocked a lot of my male friends now and I just feel no matter what I do I will always be the villain and not good enough or always to blame.

I'm with a guy who cooks me dinner every night, wants to marry me, would do anything for me, we have wonderful intimacy, I'm very attracted to him, and I genuinely like him a lot as a person aside from loving him. But I keep freaking out over disagreements, /obsessing/ over the idea that he doesn't think I'm good enough despite him telling me over and over that I am everything to him. I ruminate over the idea that he's done having his fun, so what he has and does with me won't compare to fun of his past. Telling him I hate him, that I liked other partners better, etc. Maybe it's because deep down I must be that insecure and must not feel good enough about myself to believe someone could really value me so much. I hate that I keep ruining a beautiful thing because of my insecurities. When he looks at me with love I feel scared and push him away. I've always wanted a partner like him so not sure why I am behaving like this. During fights (where he is ALWAYS trying very hard to de escalate things) I want to reach out and touch him or ask him to hug me but have this bad feeling in my chest so I can't reach out even though it's what I want the most.

Ways to go “FP-shopping”?,1681327954.0,"I know. I know. This is ridiculous, and silly, and possibly not even healthy. But hear me out.

I’ve had the same FP for about five years. There were a couple of times when I thought I had a new one, and then within a day or two, it’s the same person all over again. 

Problem is, this person 1) is kind of a jerk sometimes, 2) does not want to talk to me, and 3) barely has their shit together as it is.

I’m so tired of hearing negative things he has to say about me and wanting to destroy myself over it. And I’m tired of remembering our positive memories together only to get slapped in the face with reality minutes later.

It’d be great if I didn’t have an FP at all, but for whatever reason, that isn’t possible for me right now. 

I can’t do this anymore. Please. PLEASE. If anyone has a way of influencing who their FP is, even a little bit, tell me how. 

Are there any fictional characters who are more likely to become someone’s FP somehow? Because I feel like, at least then, I won’t have to worry about them rejecting me. But if not, that’s okay.

A perspective shift on the concept of an “FP”,1681319065.0,"I know some people don’t like FP but I’m using it anyways.

I saw a video the other day that described an FP as the person you feel safest with so they become a sort of safe haven for you.

I never thought of it this way. I always just thought of an FP as someone I liked a lot.

I realize now I’ve been chasing security, safety and stability all this time, but I tried to find and create it in another person which just doesn’t work.

It’s not realistic or kind for your “FP” to be your rock and foundation all the time. They are human and sometimes they can’t be that for you.

If you truly love them, you won’t place that burden on them. You can ask them for what they can give but don’t crucify them for not being a romanticized ideal that you can’t control.

I’m trying to learn how to create that foundation within myself and maybe something else.

Truth be told it’s hard for me to completely trust myself. A lot of decisions I made didn’t compound that way I hoped they would and I became afraid of myself even.

I essentially messed it all up and it all came crashing down and I’m starting from scratch again.

Some people say they rely on God as their foundation and I get it I guess. God is supposed to be a form of unconditional love but I don’t really believe in that stuff.

In fact I grew up in a religious family and religion was very traumatizing and invalidating for me in a lot of ways.

So yeah. I guess I don’t have the answer yet as to what is my foundation and my security. I just know it’s not supposed to be in another person completely.

I don’t think it’s wrong to rely on others though. Nobody is at 100% all the time.

But, just freakish though that my FP was the FP because at one point they meant safety love and security made me a little sad.

My Success Story,1681169459.0,"Where I Was:
- Depressed from age 11 to 27, much if it suicidally depressed
- Every romantic relationship was chaotic dramatic stressful and often emotionally debilitating
- Got arrested for domestic violence
- in $5k-$30k of debt at any given time from age 18 until 31
- damaged skin from picking and scratching
- failed out of school over and over

Where I Am Now:
- paid off $30k in debt over the last 2 years, and have $30k invested in my retirement accounts, on track to max out my retirement accounts again this year
- going on 4 years single and finally ready to get into a relationship again, and can trust myself to finally be a good partner 
- have overcome weekly, often daily binge eating / binge exercising, restrict and binge cycle
- genuinely happy to be alive and look forward to each day when I wake up
- equipped with and confident in my skills to overcome emotional stresses, negative thoughts, difficult people, and difficult situations 
- eating a balanced and healthful diet and exercise a safe amount regularly (I still occasionally have days I revert slightly but they arent to such a so far gone extent, and then I get back on track immediately)
- I can honestly say I am a good person, a good friend, and a good partner

How I Got Here:
- Paying extra to see a BPD and DBT expert with many years of experience. I went to various general therapists that didnt help that much over the years. 
- weekly DBT therapy 
- CBT therapy
- the right medication. I have been on and off antidepressants since I was 18. They kept me from killing myself barely, but I was never thriving. Just wasting away slower. I tried a lot of different meds and dosages to eventually find what needed. 
- the right diagnosis. I have BPD and Bipolar 2. Ive been diagnosed w BPD, depression, bipolar, did, over the years.  
- reading A LOT. I read a lot of reddit posts on what to do and what others have done when they are struggling. I read the books they suggested. Those books are: Unshakeable Freedom (its about stoicism), The Four Agreements, Brain over Binge, Happiness is a Choice You Make, Mindset, I Hate You Dont Leave Me, Walking on Eggshells, Getting It Done When Youre Depressed, Feeling Good, Attached, The Courage to be Disliked, dbt workbooks, cbt work books, 7 habits of highly effective people, how to win and influence people, the personal finance Reddit wiki, i will teach you to be rich, the millionaire next door, online courses on how to be happy, and so many more books about how to overcome BPD and depression and bipolar, and peoples’ experiences. Stoicism was the final puzzle piece i needed to finally overcome my depression and learn how to lessen the intensity and duration of it when the bipolar brings it on.
- Support Groups: I did an in person Depression and Bipolar support group and I hated every minute of it at first. I thought I was better than everyone there. Ha! I was in denial. It was easier to think I was better than everyone than to accept that I was severely disfunctional and in extreme pain. Group provided a safe space for me to accept that I needed help, and not to feel so ashamed about needing it. It felt good to finally be able to truly RELATE to other people. Id been suffering silently for so long.
- Anger Management: I was court ordered to do an anger management class when I was 18 years old. I learned a lot and it was very eye opening to see what my future held if I didnt get my anger under control. 45 year old women, 65 year old women, shooting guns at their husbands’ feet, vandalizing their cars, angry at the world… it motivated me to change so I didnt end up like them. I was grateful to have been sent there at 18 instead of 45 to learn these lessons early.

For the majority of my life, I wanted to die every fucking day.

And now I am happy, financially stable, emotionally stable, and know that no matter what happens, I will get thru it and I will be ok.

Im early 30s now. I have the rest of my life to be happy and finally LIVE the life I have always wanted, without mental health preventing me from doing so.

I fear I'm doomed to never be the father I was meant to be.,1681031130.0,"How can I actually believe I'll be an amazing dad someday like I want and visualise so desperately. I always wanted to be the fun adventurous goofy golden retriever like dad. My partner wants me to throw in a mix of my rancher man, assertive, calm grounded and sometimes stern side which I also totally see as my dynamic. I see this so clearly and I want it so bad with her I think I could strive to be a perfect dad without leaving my character or struggling at all. 

Before I met my partner and healed significantly my fear was my splitting and rage. I couldn't control it I would always fear I was a loaded gun and would not be able to regulate my emotions and accidentally release it on my kids. I'm not ready quite yet of course I need some more years of consistency. But at this point I'm fully confident I will be able to heal enough to never EVER repeat my cycle of abuse. But now I fear something different and in a way much much worse. 

My partner recently asked me something along the lines of what would be my reaction if I got news my mum died. She's constantly on the brink of death and spiralling so that wasn't too odd a question especially since I was dodging another call. To my discomfort and disappointment I realised I wouldn't shed a tear over it. I told her that after giving it some proper thought, and I can exactly imagine the scenario I can literally put myself there. Imagine the text coming in from my sister. Hearing she took it too far. Considering details like she's in Australia and the news would come delayed. And I know I wouldn't feel that level of devestation. Sadness for sure, heavy sadness. She's been alone for so long. Yearning for her lost children, dead brother, and drinking herself into oblivion. And that's a depressing thought I would feel a lot of guilt. But in a fucked way I was over all more sad about all the stories she was yet to tell me that I was curious about. Backstory on her, my father, them together, my childhood, my ancestors etc. Less about the actual loss of her as a mother or even a person in my life. 

Then Maddie asked about my dad. My dad recently has had a major shift of character and has come through for the first time in my life as a shadow of 20% of an actual father. Once again I thought I would feel particularly sad because of his character arc and the level of genuine love and care he's shown for me recently. And it would hurt a lot. Especially sting because of that but... Ultimately my biggest fear and thought would be losing what little financial security he offered. And the major opportunity in the future of taking over his company after getting my MBA and working under him for some years like we've set up. 

Maddie is never like this at all, but she rolled her eyes at me annoyed and said I sounded like an edgy teenager and I wasn't considering this clearly. She didn't believe me. But I'm not in the slightest worked up about them and I'm pretty damn good at picturing these things completely realistically. 

There's a reason though. I mean I'm not a complete monster. The problem is she wouldn't even feel like a mother dying to me. Someone who I love and care for sure. I would be deeply sad, but I wouldnt feel the anguish of losing a mother. I never even got a mother figure. My mum was an alcoholic who for the short period of time I lived with her I had to mother, provide and clean up after myself. My father isn't much better he left me to an actual psychopath of a step mum for my entire childhood while he was away on his business trips, well aware of a significant portion of what she was doing to me. And when he was home he was explosively abusive. (It wasn't torture but it fucked me up mentally with my own emotional regulation) They will never be able to be my parents in my head I could never internalise that even if I wanted to. They never became that figure in my life or even showed me what that could look like from the start.

I realised the absolute lack of desire or understanding of a parental figure a while ago when my sister was sobbing to me as a teenager telling me all she wanted was a mother figure. And I remember comforting her but thinking in my head that was downright stupid. Absolutely no empathy for that feeling myself, I had no desire or longing for a mother figure or father for that matter. My sister has much much better memory than me of early on in our lives. She was also in general treated much better so it makes sense that pain and longing was established for her.


The thing is I don't think my partner Maddie can extend me that empathy for my detachment because despite her parents horrible neglect and abuse of her, even surpassing mine (and mine is bat shit insane levels) especially her father jesus fucking christ. She still loves his ass. She still insists on seeing him, keeping an (admittedly very distant and ghosty) relationship with him. She still has forgiven and sees her mother truly as her mother, and a good one at that. The bar is in hell. I think her mother deserves to be forgiven for being a heroin abusing drug dealing addict because of her situation and trauma sure. But jesus christ her dad, he did absolutely unthinkable things to her. And he didn't even have the trauma to back it up. Even if according to her he stopped abusing meth and calmed the fuck down recently... 

Though hardly even really fucking true since she's worried about me repeatedly meeting him because he may get abusive or aggressive with her and of course I would defend her. And apparently her dad may try to start a fight with my ass if I set boundaries with him. (Just from the scenario of me warning him assertively and calmly that I'll take her back home and he won't see her for a while if he doesn't quit it and stabilise) He's 6'4 and over 30 but he's literally an emotionally stunted baby. Also if he hurt her I wouldn't be worried about fucking losing at all but the fact she has to worry about that says enough. This is turning into a completely off topic side vent my point is she is an incredibly forgiving person even for her bpd jealous bf of a dad. Her mum had a turn around so fair enough ig. And even though she had to parent her baby brother for her mother from a very young age, I think she was able to establish and connect with her at some point earlier on. It helps she has an incredibly good memory of her early childhood especially considering her trauma level. Maybe it's all rooted in that. I'd have to give it more thought why she is like this and what I lack. Other than her insane amount of emotional intelligence maturity and empathy of course. Maybe not so much with her attachment to her parents lol.

And she seems like despite all her shit she's made to be an amazing mother. She's so mature and calm and prepared and affectionate and intelligent and understanding ugh the list goes on. She's fucking set. I mean she's swamped on the kid side of tiktok and is far far down the path of studying psychology surrounding childhood development and parenting. She's very confident and has already set out very clearly how our kids will be properly supported and parented by us. I mean theres rules lol and I can't argue them she knows what she's talking about. We must undo our generational trauma and set them up for complete success. 

But I'm still nervous. So nervous. Especially after giving thought to and realising that revelation about my true feelings towards my parents and why. How can I be the dream dad I envision for myself when I never even had a glimpse of the real thing my entire life. There's no foundation not even subconscious. Never had any idea of what a parental figure even really was. She can help lead me a little and I have the passion and dedication to do this right but god I feel like in a deeper way to my core and maybe even developed character over time I'm just fucked in this regard. 

But I keep imagining myself in those golden retriever, goofy, adventurous, assertive rancher dad scenarios and I do truly think that's just me and I could nail it naturally (assuming I'm fully healthy which I wouldn't dare have children unless that was done for years first) 

Doesn't matter. Fucked inherently or not I'll try my absolute hardest and bring all the love, support and healthiness to my children that I was never given. 

I'm so awkward around kids too I get scared of them that doesn't help things. I gotta go practice with them a lot before.

Silly hopes from a non pwBPD,1680563082.0,"Tl;dr - Ex developed an FP relationship with my best friend while still being with me, he wouldn't accept her due to his friendship and honour, so she strung me along for months obsessing over and ""loving"" him, until she admitted what she did. We broke up and I'm traumatised, but I wonder if it will be always like this for her. 

I had a bpd girlfriend who I still love to bits and worked my hardest to understand her, and to be there for her, which she seemingly appreciated. As a quiet, emotionally withdrawn guy, I've never really felt love, passion and full-blown commitment until I started dating her, feelings she seemingly reciprocated. We went through some happy months, but for what I noticed and heard, her idealisation of me broke down by December and apparently she started obsessing about my friend back then (and cheated on me with another guy too, not with this friend). Being in love, I was back with her one week later, which seemed to be true from her side too since we both turned into useless sobbing messes during this whole time, with her getting sick due to skipping too many baths. We agreed we can't stay apart for long, and even after this last breakup, we didn't go more than two or three days of no contact.

I'm devastated that she managed to replace me fully in her heart, despite us apparently loving each other and telling each other with some frequency that we wanted to merge within each other and, until less than two weeks ago, saying we'd be together forever, and you know, I truly believed that. Truly believed we had found actual love on each other.

Maybe I might come across as someone who just WANTS her infatuation to be an obsession, and I fully understand. But see, she tells me she's in love with him, but he never treated her with anything more than polite distance, and they talked few times to each other. I've heard secondhand what she says about my friend, and knowing him for years I can say it's almost a book character that she's made up, but is based on him. Our other friends in common who heard her say the same.

So I'm heartbroken, asking myself if it's going to be forever this way. If suffering from BPD is going to make her ""love"" skipping from obsession target to obsession target. Of course, I have hopes that someday we will work out, but I know how silly these are. But I worry about her. The sheer pain and agony she inflicted on me made me want to do some really bad things to her, which I of course didn't, but some other person in my situation might.

Is weed a medicine for my emptiness or a crutch?,1680373379.0,"When I realized I had BPD, it came as a relief to be able to give a name to the subtle wrong feeling I've always lived with: emptiness. Not quite depression, not quite anger. An absence of contentment and in it's place uncomfortable uncertainty. Waking up and my first thought of the day being ""did I do something wrong yesterday?"" 

I don't always feel this way. Sometimes, when things are going really well or I receive praise or have sex or good luck I feel all the good feelings. I enjoy these times but I no longer trust the feelings. They are a great natural high, probably the best high, and like all highs they don't last.

But I can bring the good feelings back anytime I want, with weed. Take me at my emptiest: give me some bad news on a day when I am already full of emptiness and I'll be a despondent mess, unable to smile, seeking isolation, crying and wanting to be asleep. I smoke some weed and voila, I'm back baby, all grins, improvised songs, making bids for the attention of my loved ones, giving back rubs, eventually falling into deep untroubled sleep in my bed, relaxed, comfortable as I've ever been.

""Why are you such a pothead"" I've been asked many times over the years and I've never known how to answer. Dunno, I like to get high I guess? ""Can you even go a day without your weed?"" ""Why do you have to be high all the time?"" These assholes questions throw shade, imply a weakness, a lack of self control, a tendency for escapism. I'm not weak, and I have decent self control. But yes, I do like to escape the goddamn emptiness because I want to live rather than cry.

The assholes have a point though. Weed has side effects that make it unsuitable for use all the time. If I use it during the day I become less productive and too inwardly focused, less interested in other people, happy but dumb. 

I have a busy life, a family and a job, volunteer work, home renos to do, appointments to get to, and I can't be dumb during the day when all my responsibilities need tending to. So years ago I settled on the routine of waiting until the evening to indulge. Although I may have felt emptiness during the busy day, I could always look forward to collapsing into comfort for an hour or two before a delicious sleep. 

It's not a perfect system because I still need to endure the emptiness throughout the day. And there are still side effects from the weed, like hazy memory, and difficulty waking up at 5:30am when I like to go to the gym.

And I also wonder if my regular weed use contributes to the emotional disregulation I feel as a person with BPD. Weed has been part of my life for so long, I can't clearly remember what I'm like without it.

So there are more than enough reasons to quit weed, at least for awhile. And I have tried to do this, many many times, and yet I keep coming back to it. 

The last time I took a break from weed was a few years back. The break was about three months long. I was proud of myself for being able to put it down and I even started to wonder why I used to do it every day. I felt a sense of freedom from having to go through the same rituals every day. 

The evenings were hard. I found myself craving some kind of special treat and ended up drinking alcohol more often. I found the best way to cope with evening emptiness was to throw myself into creative projects. As long as my hands were busy I was usually distracted from the emptiness until bedtime. I had to keep moving. I was more productive. I had a harder time sitting still.

Maybe one day some a pharmaceutical company will make a drug that contains the parts of weed that combat emptiness, without the side effects.

I ruined everything for no reason. I'm trying to change.,1680305356.0,"This is my first reddit post, so I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong.

My boyfriend and I dated for almost three years (anniversary in 2 months). I had one friend that wasn't shared with him. I developed an FP relationship with one of his oldest friends. I let myself obsess and eventually sent inappropriate messages. My boyfriend discovered this and broke up with me. I left our home knowing we were broken up but with hope he'd forgive me and take me back. Yet, I didn't think I could handle being alone and, of course, asked my FP, his friend, to meet me. Long story short, I slept with him. The next day, my boyfriend gave me a second chance. I had to tell him I slept with his friend. We're done.

I can't believe this is real. I don't know how to deal with all this self hatred, guilt, and depression. The life we had and planned together is stripped from both of us. I don't know why I did what what I did, but I still did it and deserve the consequences.

This all occurred over the course of the last two days. I'm now distracting myself by applying to jobs, scheduling therapy appointments, and cleaning. I can't be alone with my thoughts but I shouldn't see anyone right now.

That was a long time ago as I’m currently 33, but on my healing journey I’ve seen loads of people doing well who say they’re also on meds so I had to ask. I’m going to try to stay off them. I believe I’ve gotten through the worst of it actually, but still have (internal) episodes sometimes that make me question my progress. Best of well wishes to you all.",mariopartymummy,,False,1260mx0,8,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/1260mx0/can_you_recover_without_meds_do_you_get_off_them/

BPD and relationships/dissociating,1680072000.0,"I don't know if anyone has ever experienced a such high level of dissociation after your breakup. I dated a guy through our my freshman year, I guess I could call him my real first love, my first boyfriend. Things were really good in the beginning, like really fucking good. The more time I spent with him though the more I started to pick and the smallest things. I would feel guilty/sad and jealous just from him not being able to call. Whenever that would happen I had this little voice telling me that he's going to abandon me. That he really didn't care about me. He would only be gone for a few hours, sometimes days for vacation but that was from his family. His parents started to notice we were fighting like a lot on the phone. I would tell him I wanted to break up with him and never see him again. It sounded evil but I felt comfortable in seeing feel how I felt, while he was begging for me not to do it and not end things. This went on for our whole relationship of me being pity and not regulating my emotions. What really didn't help was his parents telling me I was manipulative (they weren't wrong. But my head was in the gutters) everytime we fought id self harm and take pictures on my snap account just for him to login and see it. I felt so fucking horrible all the time. I genuinely hated it. I hated how I treated him, I hated that he had to beg for me back. As he did this practically out whole relationship for 10 months. I always just wanted to be with him and when I couldn't I felt so horrible. It was love but not the good kind. It was obsessive love, I don't even think you can consider the word love in it. I would skip weeks of school and just sleep the whole day. I was depressed and failing academically. My parents werent too proud either. My mom would tell my that I'm ruining this boy and hurting him. I agreed. Somewhere in July I attempted suicide. I was placed into inpatient where I remained for a month or so. I felt so nauseous the whole entire time (I think this is when my dissociating really hit) I would dissociate all the time and just stare off into space while life was happening all around me. Eventually I got out but and he waited for me but things still continued and we eventually broke up.

It kinda felt like I lost the other half of me. We fought a lot but we had really good times. Ever since ive found comfort in being alone and I really don't think I need anyone. I've been doing dbt therapy which has helped so much and I'm so grateful I can get therapy near me that really helps. I tend to dissociate so much more then I did when I was with him. I don't really talk to that many people now, I have a few good friends but I keep more to myself. I'd like to believe it has nothing to do with our breakup and I'm just maturing but I can't really say. I've finally learned self love but dissociating is still really hard for me to control. My mind wanders in this big space and I can't seem to catch it.",zombnie,,False,125fhhi,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/125fhhi/bpd_and_relationshipsdissociating/
Do you think aspects of BD root from a healthy desire to compete?,1680030031.0,"I realized yesterday I have body dysmorphia. I had escaped this reality for years because my obsessions mainly centred around my face, not my weight. But it's time for me to finally admit that checking my camera and mirror 25x per day is not normal. I didn't realize it was so often until I actually counted it and wrote down my triggers for doing so.

Just to be clear, this is obviously a disorder and it's been devastating in my life, not to mention the 10% of people with anorexia who end up dead.

I sometimes wonder if it would be less bad if women had healthy avenues to compete? If people in society did in general? It seems very normal for humans to compare and upgrade themselves *to an extent* but the problem is that society feels like a game where your life is on the line. It's healthy to play hopscotch but we're all playing squid game. The risk of not looking beautiful in our minds is being wholely abandoned.

I love to compete, I love to be beautiful, I love to upgrade myself in many ways, if I were healthy would I find less enjoyment in winning? If the lows weren't so low, would the highs be as high? I'm addicted to the ups and downs of loving myself when I win in these one sided comparisons and hating myself when I don't.

Is this all a fantasy world I'm creating to escape the competition in my real life? If I hyperfocus on my nose, do I forget the fact that I have $600 in my bank account or the fact that I can't seem to keep friends?",terfdestroyer111,,False,124yn4a,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDrecovery/comments/124yn4a/do_you_think_aspects_of_bd_root_from_a_healthy/
How do I get out of an episode?,1679999910.0,"I don’t know if “episode” is the right word but it’s all I can think of right now. My mood is up and down so much right now and the littlest of things are making me fly off the handle at the people I love. I’m self destructing and trying to sabotage everything good in my life and I don’t know how to make it stop. 

I’m totally aware of what’s happening but I can’t seem to get a hold on it when something so tiny makes me unbearably angry and sad all at once. I guess I don’t know how to back down. 

Does anyone have any tips on getting a handle on it? I don’t really have any friends or family I can talk to about this because it just feels like I’m m making excuses for my awful behaviour.

"I feel like I’m being used, a fill-in, I need a reality check",1679948522.0,"So I’m on the cluster b spectrum as well and didn’t know. I got into a relationship with someone who had BPD, and neither of us knew. 

I was the one who got hurt when she split, she got hurt too but it was moreso her delusions which caused the splitting.  This was one of the ways we discovered something was wrong and lead to the diagnosis.  

Anyway, I can’t talk to “normal people” about this because their advice is to demonize cluster b people and they only say to “run!”  I don’t find it helpful, I’ve been through years of therapy and I know what it’s like to see danger in everything and I empathize. I’m not an angel either and I’ve been lucky to have people who offered me grace and redemption 

Long story short, when I began to understand our relationship was abusive, my ex and I went no contact and it’s been over 2 years. I spent the time single and in therapy and wished her the best 

We’ve recently reconnected and it’s only been because she too has been in weekly therapy for at least a year now.  I immediately noticed we have new abilities regarding taking ownership of our emotions, and we’ve been talking every day.  For the most part it feels healthy, there’s been nothing strange with the correspondence. In fact, I enjoy it. 

It’s platonic enough… we do reminisce about memories and such, but we mainly just share our days with one another and discuss health and therapy. She told me she missed my friendship and wishes things ended differently.  

Thing is, I’m starting to think she’s just using me to fill a void until she gets into another relationship.  She did tell me she was single and I mean, I’m not her bf, she can do as she pleases

…. But I don’t want to get used or be a fill-in for anyone.  

She sent me a meme today that said something like: 

“me: I’m not going to be in relationships for now, I need to work on myself

The moment someone attractive looks at me: I’m ready to get hurt again”

I’m not interested in making jokes like this given what happened between us, not interested in being some stable friend for her while I watch her ruin more relationships, and herself.

I can’t tell if I’m catastrophizing and spiraling over something that was just a joke meme and it triggered me?

I just want to be the healthiest I can be and sometimes I can’t tell if my fears are valid. 

I don’t want to be used.  I don’t. I can’t.  But I also don’t wanna run away if there’s no real reason to and I know at least part of what I’m feeling is triggered anxiety. But that also doesn’t mean there’s not a real concern underneath it all. My go-to reaction is to jump ship and run away. But I’ve learned that isn’t healthy, so here I am trying to figure out what I feel and why, and then a healthy way to address those feelings. 

She wants to meet up in person and a part of me does…. Not with any expectations other than authenticity from both of us. I’m so happy that she put in the hard work to face her trauma, I’m happy for myself for doing the same.   But I think full recovery is a life long journey; one that I can understand.
