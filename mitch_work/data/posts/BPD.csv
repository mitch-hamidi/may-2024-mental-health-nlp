Should I go to the hospital ,1716145973,"Hi
Im 15f and when I was 12 i got sent to the mental hospital for wanting to delete myself. Ive changed therapist ever since and my current one knows how deeply that affected me. Ive started to have signs of an attempt and ive tried in the past few weeks. She doesnt want to send me in cus she is scared (ig) how it will affect me.

"manic state after breakup (F 20) smoking a tonüçÉ, tinder, I need advice üò≠üò≠",1716145641,"I just went through a breakup with my boyfriend of 2 years (completely valid, he was there for one of my suicide attempts and I got diagnosed during our relationship) 

I‚Äôm trying to focus on myself but I‚Äôm hypersexual so I‚Äôm still hooking up with him every other day while looking for a new person to hook up with (a woman, never been with one since I‚Äôve been distracting myself with long term relationships with men) 

DISCLAIMER: He knows I‚Äôm talking to ppl but still wants to hit

We have been split up for around 3 weeks and I‚Äôve been high the majority of the time. I haven‚Äôt picked up since I ran out 2 days ago and I think I should keep it up but it‚Äôs the only way I don‚Äôt go through constant rollercoaster emotions like crying one minute then painting him as the bad guy in my mind to being like I don‚Äôt care at alll.

Also unadded him on snap when I was in an episode but now I want him back on snap but that‚Äôs real manipulative like I‚Äôm not dumb. I recognize when I‚Äôm in episodes and can‚Äôt pull myself out of them especially now and it is literal hell emotionally when I don‚Äôt smoke a little.

Why,1716145558,Why do I only like people who do not like me? Why do I feel like every single relationship I‚Äôve had with anyone is me giving 100000 and getting 10? Is this part of bpd or something else ,MiserableSweet4033,,FALSE,1cvvom7,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cvvom7/why/
Will she come back? ,1716145275,"Will she come back?

This is my first ever reddit post, i felt like i needed somewhere to talk about how i feel and look for maybe some answers to questions i cant ask her. 

Dont just tell me to ‚Äúmove on‚Äù because i genuinely believe ill never be able to love anyone as much as i love her and i feel everywhere i go ill just be looking for her in every girl i meet. 

My gf or ex gf now i guess, she struggles from bpd and other mental health disorders, she is on new meds which make her suicidal and depressed, she has low mood and is struggling right now, she messaged me saying she doesn‚Äôt love me anymore but its not just me she doesnt love anyone much anymore. Do you think she‚Äôll come back after she gets better?

She used to say we were soulmates and that we‚Äôre perfect for eachother, it just sucks that she is in a bad state right now. TLDR : will she come back after she gets better? or is it over forever. Note: she said she doesnt want me to contact her which i think is just so she can focus on herself. she broke up with me yesterday. 

im heartbroken right now and struggling so any advice helps! much love everyone. 

we‚Äôve been dating for 3 months and she has pushed me away a few times but never to the point she has now, before she didnt block me everywhere and if i reached out (i did reach out everytime) she would respond everytime and we sorted things out. Is this another split? i am still getting to grips with ‚ÄúBPD‚Äù and learning more each day, i feel awful the way she feels but i wish i knew if it was a split and if she was coming back or not. she used to push me away saying ‚Äúi dont want to hurt u‚Äù and ‚Äú u deserve better‚Äù usually this happened when she split ( i think anyway) is this another split? 

I have her brother added and we message, i asked her brother to tell her if she thinks we have a chance of getting back together and her brother told me she said ‚Äúi hope we meet‚Äù which was very cryptic and i didnt want to ask anything else as shes having a rough enough time as is, shes been through alot and im wanting to give her the world, im not sure what other context i can give other than i know we loved eachother as much as the other person and she was the best gf i could ask for. and we have been dating for 3 months. (tell me if any more specific context is needed)

hope some people can help me right now because im struggling and want to know if she is splitting and will come back and how i should handle the situation, much love all have a good day all!

lack of sense of self/shifting identities? ,1716143643,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm someone without BPD but someone I love has it and I‚Äôm kind of having a crisis over a certain symptom. I‚Äôve seen a lot of people with and without BPD talk about a lack of sense of self or stable identity, and this is definitely something my ex girlfriend turned close friend struggles with. When we met she was going through a bit of a tradcath phase, but considering we‚Äôre both women that kind of was at odds with our relationship. About 6 months through dating she confessed to me that the narrative of her past that she‚Äôd been telling me was actually not true, instead of being someone just discovering that she liked women she was actually a lifelong lesbian who had been with other women before (she had told me I was the first one). I didn‚Äôt really care about that because it didn‚Äôt change how I felt, if anything it made me feel a bit more secure that it wasn‚Äôt just some experiment. Eventually we broke up for other reasons but we had a really close and special relationship, so for the next four years we had an on and off close friendship that would sometimes veer into romantic/sexual, but the narrative was always that we shared a special love in the past that was the foundation of the close friendship that followed. She also dated other women during this time. She was very into being a lesbian during these years, talking about how much she loves women, lesbian culture/music/gossip etc and was really into feminism and was a bit of a man hater (I‚Äôm not really). We shared a lot of experiences and past traumas because of this. 

Now suddenly she‚Äôs revealed to me that over the past few months she met a man and she‚Äôs actually straight, could never love a woman and our entire past was actually a lie. She‚Äôs allowed to date whoever she wants obviously, and sometimes these things change, but this is such a rapid overhaul of who she was just a few months ago that feels completely unnatural, and I think this new personality is one that I won‚Äôt like/is very triggering for me. She told me that she was fine abusing me in our relationship because I‚Äôm a woman and that she treats this guy much better/views him as more important than me even though they just met because he‚Äôs a man. It feels vaguely homophobic and unnecessarily cruel to say you used women but men are more worthy by default. Even though I still care about her I told her that I don‚Äôt think I could grow to like someone like that and it feels like I have to mourn the person I was close with and the past she‚Äôs trying to erase. 

Is this normal? Or is this just a particularly aggressive version of the lack of identity symptom? Is it really that easy to just change who you are like that? I‚Äôm sorta at a loss with what I should do here. Have you ever had an intense shift in personality like this that resulted in you losing friendships?

Asking for Accommodations at Work,1716137434,"Ive heard of BPD over the last few years, for a long time i thought it was something my parents had and i wouldn't have to deal with it. Well im 22 now and im fairly certian i was wrong but now i think ive put myself between a rock and a hard place, at time of writing im just starting the process of joining waitlists to figure out exactly whats going on, and possibly confirm my, and my doctors suspicion that it is BPD and get a diagnosis and start some type of treatment, but i was hired on in a fast food place last week before something happened last Friday night and has completely derailed me for a week now and before i was considering and perusing help.

My first day is Tuesday, and now that ive had a week to sit and reflect, notice my self destructive patterns and learn i know im going to need accommodations so i can atleast try and stop the patterns from repeating themselves untill i can fully understand whats going on but even though i know im a hard worker and i know i do bring my own value and unique skills to the store, and am always the first to sign up for extra shifts, im terrified that asking for accommodations as the new guy either on one of my first days or first few weeks is putting a beacon on my head that says fire me! im the problem! even though logically i know that makes no sense if i really am all of those things i said i am. Im pretty sure this is just me in my own head, but what were your experiences asking for accommodations? Should i ask in a certain way? leave some things out but include others?

Im struggling with whatever it is im feeling....,1716143579,"Hi all, i will try to describe how i feel as best as i can, but to be honest, i dont really know what it is. This may be a little long because i have to add context to describe a few things. I was diagnosed with BPD, PTDS, Anxiety and OCD about 5 years ago

I am 38F, my partner of 9 years is 34M. The relationship is rather rocky at times, but for the most part we work through it. Ive had some CBT to help control my emotional reactions, which worked really well, but i think y partner also needs the same thing, as when he gets mad, he doesnt just talk things through, he has a very nasty tongue. I wont go into some of the things hes said because they would immediately create a profile for him and i wont get non-biased opinions in here because everyone is likely to just hate him. I also used to have a nasty tongue but my CBT gave me the means to have a lot of self control, so i havent been like that for years.

  
Thing is, my partner and I live together, but we barely do anything. last thing we did was visit a waterpark for his birthday, thats all we've done in 2024. small things like a 2 hour comedy show then straight home to bed (and no time spent together before that either) happen sometimes, or we sit at home watching a tv series or playing a videogame, but that isnt often either. 

Now heres my issue with my feelings, all the above in mind, we had a bad fight 10 days ago and he said some really hurtful things, also refused to apologise because it was my fault for 'winding him up' (i was correcting where he told me things i did during the day, that he didnt even see, but obv i did because its me) by being argumentative. So my feelings shut off completely, i was numb to him emotionally, both happy and sad. he has since apologised and promised to get therapy, but hasnt done any of it yet. Im still rather withdrawn, but open enough to sleep with him last night, however kissing him felt rather forced. Today he is out with his friends like he does once a week and i HATE it. He's gone for a full 12 hours every time he goes, its a 1 hour drive there and 1 hour back, so i guess a long day makes the driving and petrol cost worth it. but i just hate that hes going there and whats worse, it sounds real fun because theres BBQ on. I feel really negative about this whole thing but i dont know what it is. i dont want to stop him having fun, but i dont want him to go either. at the same time, after what keeps happening (the arguments are about 1 every 6 weeks and they hurt my heart like hell!) i dont even want him to spend time with me. if he asked me now id say yes just to be polite but tbh i dont know what i even want. the last few times we had bigger plans than watching stuff on tv, we argued so he cancelled. i had to host a family bbq 9 days ago which we were both excited about but we fought so i had to do alone, he decided last minute before everyone arrived, to come and help me but only because i practically begged. He drives and i dont, so also during this fight he dropped me off to collect my son from school then drove off and left me there (its an hour walk, or 2 seperate buses). (i told my son i got the bus because the car was broke, we are good at keeping civil when my son is around, i cant exactly fault partner for that)

But yeah, what the hell is this feeling i have? i resent partner for all this bad crap, esp recently because a lot happened over 10 days, but over the years ive been promised change and hes finally saying he will accept therapy (though hasnt even got on the list yet). Im jealous (i think) that hes out doing all this cool stuff with his friends, but i dont want him here doing things with me anyway. (there are times we've had fights because i was sick and asked him to stay instead of going to friends and he screamed at me, then went anyway, after id just spent 2 days taking care of him). am i wrong for feeling this way? i dont want to be accused of bringing up the past (the sick thing was back in feb) but i think all these things are painting a really bad picture of him in my head and i dont know what to do. leaving him isnt really an option right now as i need his half of the rent and bills in order to be able to afford to live here, plus, i actually dont want him gone....for some reason.

Afraid I was manipulative during the breakup,1716135345,"This is kind of long but I tried to make it as concise as possible. So a few months ago my bf ended our relationship out of the blue and I was devastated but didn't fight it or beg him to stay, I just got really sad like I always do. Initially we went no contact but I broke it and genuinely didn't expect him to reply, but he did because he was concerned for me. We agreed that we would go to limited contact, checking in every once in a while (like once every 1-2 weeks).

Fast forward to the other week when I thought I was coping really well but it was like someone flipped a switch for a couple days and I became really depressed, like couldn't go to the store without crying. One of those nights I was up all night genuinely feeling suicidal for hours before I contacted my ex. I did not say directly that I was suicidal but definitely told him stuff about how I felt trapped, etc. He was much colder than our previous limited-contact interactions which made things worse I think. He asked if I was suicidal and I said I didn't know how to answer that. Then I said that it wasn't his job to help me and that I was going to take some medication to help me get to sleep (it was like 4am and he knows I take meds for sleep sometimes). He said he would check in with me tomorrow and I left him on seen as I was just so tired.

We are on opposite timezones (he is in Australia, I am in the UK currently) and he didn't message me to check in until midnight the next night (my time) when I had already gone to sleep/was about to sleep after taking my meds. I recognize now that I could've texted him in advance to say I was going to bed but that I was safe, but I just didn't want to. When I woke up the next day and looked at the message again he would've already been asleep. So later that evening I texted him apologizing for messaging the other night, that I felt I'd been at risk but I shouldn't have messaged him. When he wrote back later on he said ""I appreciate your message"" which felt to me like he maybe felt manipulated by me not responding to his midnight checkin. I felt so bad. Obviously i can't read his mind but that's where my thoughts are going. 

Later on when we checked in that night for the last time before going back to full NC, he asked if I was safe and I said I said I couldn't really say. Then the convo continued and ended sadly but amicably. I went to take a shower, came down and the cops were at my house. I said I was fine and when I went to check my messages he had blocked me.

BPD - Mania? Song Suggestion: Seesaw - Ummet Ozcan,1716142321,"I know it's kinda contested (to my knowledge) whether individuals with BPD expirience mania - which is typically ascribed to Bipolar. But looking at a definition of ""manic"": 'showing wild, apparently deranged, excitement and energy.'
 I have often felt like that when I have a loss of self. To be able to regulate my emotions during those episodes is really really hard even when applying therapeutic exercises. I recently lost my FP of almost 4 years (long story) and I feel manic nearly almost every other day. I've been assessed for bipolar and my therapist agrees I don't meet the criteria. Anyways this is my incredibly long winded way of showing solidarity in this wild ride of being an individual with the ""Beautiful Princess Disorder"" - the gift of song. 

Seesaw - Ummet Ozcan

""Up and down
We go up and down the seesaw 'til we are in free-fall
Now we're going upside down
We go up and down the seesaw
Licking off the sea salt
Always up and down""

When I'm feeling what I would describe as being manic - this is exactly what I feel like. Up and down. Black or white. Am I a good person or a bad person. Then just free falling into that pit of pure unrestrained and raw emotion. Free falling from the sense of self you though yourself to be. Trying to find a semblance of yourself in the wreckage of the the life you had built. And you know you can do it. You have to. But you've done it so many times before, but now it's to the point of exhaustion. Trudging ever forward to the magical land of healing that I've been journeying to since I was first placed in therapy at 8. Up and down - I can't wait to get off this f***ing seesaw.

Anyways - I thought ya'll would enjoy a song suggestion - idk if it's been posted before, but the minute I heard it, I thought of this group. Cheers! And remember friends, your darkest day is not your end!

Have any of you ever ‚Äúfavorited person‚Äù one of your parents?,1716133481,"I have a friend who‚Äôs got an extreme case of BPD (among other things) and apparently his father is his favorite person. His father is away on work and didn‚Äôt answer some of his calls, he made an attempt because of this (reason why I‚Äôm making this post).

He hated his mother because she had cancer and he felt like his father‚Äôs attention was being taken away from him, he claims he was happy when she died. When his father started dating this girl a few years later he threw a huge fit and attempted against his own life, after that they agreed that his father wouldn‚Äôt date anymore. He cried in the class more than once because his father called to say he‚Äôd be 15 minutes late to pick him up. His feelings of emptiness are also really, really bad according to the psychiatrist. (Those were examples to demonstrate that he‚Äôs not ‚Äúhigh functioning‚Äù [sorry, I don‚Äôt know if this is the correct term], and not only because of the BPD.)

So the father‚Äôs life is pretty much centered around my friend and my friend is completely dependent on him. They say he can‚Äôt be alone under any circumstance, so he‚Äôs going to be in the hospital while his father isn‚Äôt here.

It feels like I ruined my life this time :(,1716132575,"I‚Äôll try to keep this short but I truly have no one to turn to. This episode has been building the past few weeks ever since I worked with a different team and the team lead just berated me nonstop. It shattered every ounce of confidence I had in myself and I‚Äôve been spiraling since. I could really use some advice on whether I overreacted here. 

I really tried to reach out to my closest friend the past few weeks but it truly has felt like she hasn‚Äôt cared. I stopped going to our regular bar I literally live right above because leaving my apartment started to give me so much anxiety. I had family issues and just wasn‚Äôt doing well. Last week or so we did meet up at the bar and played some pool and I tried talking to her about some of it but I felt so unheard and misunderstood. She kept saying ‚ÄúI feel that‚Äù and it just pissed me off so bad because no you don‚Äôt üò≠.  There was a lull in our conversation after a while and she just said ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm gonna head out‚Äù and I took that as the biggest rejection. :(  especially because she said she was going to a mutual friends band practice. 

3 days ago we went out of town to some concerts we had planned months in advance. I knew not to go but didn‚Äôt want to bail last minute like she had on me many times before because I knew how that felt. But then her ex ended up coming and I had a good time the first day but the next morning when it was just us I tried talking to her again and got the same result where she barely offered any support and I got stuck in my head and withdrew and went nonverbal. It got on her nerves and was especially uncomfortable for her ex but I couldn‚Äôt shake it. And I couldn‚Äôt talk to her because of her dumb ex being there. When we got back in town and she dropped us off unloading the car she just dropped my bag in the road and got in her car and waited for me to pull out so she could park. That was another huge sign of rejection to me‚Ä¶just throwing my stuff in the street. So the next day I texted her nicely that I‚Äôd step back from being in her life not because she did anything wrong but she deserves to be surrounded by people who are stable and that‚Äôs not me. I didn‚Äôt want to just ghost her I wanted to give her closure as well. She replied but I honestly just deleted it without reading because I felt no matter what she said it was for the best. I do feel I made the right decision now neither of us are gonna be hurting each other‚Ä¶.but I‚Äôm the most depressed I‚Äôve been in a decade I think. 

Idk I just had expected more support from her. I was there through her bad breakup and recent DUI (which is bad I know but she‚Äôs since quit drinking and I stopped drinking as well to support her) where I made sure she was fucking ok and got her out of the house and shit to the point that she thanked me for doing all that and being there for her later on. But I‚Äôve been struggling and she never checked on me or made sure I was ok or anything despite still going to the bar with me living right upstairs. Her popping in to say hi or something would‚Äôve made a world of difference??? Because I‚Äôd have done the same for her. Did I overreact or am I valid for being hurt for not receiving the same energy back? I feel like she‚Äôs the definition of a fair weather friend and I‚Äôm hurt because she‚Äôs been treating her new guy friends from the bar so much better than me, her only female friend.   I don‚Äôt really have any friends now so I think that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm struggling with this decision, I feel so alone.

Frustrated with dating and misogyny,1716131870,"I started being romantic and intimate with a long time friend whose wanted to date for a long time. We hung out yesterday and I sort‚Äôve got the ick. We were having a conversation about something on social media where a woman was filmed being trampled by a bull after provoking it. He kept using the B-word and it started to upset me, I said I don‚Äôt like people using that word, and he basically said he will never stop using it and its a part of his vocabulary but something he doesn‚Äôt call me. I also began noticing him not responding to my jokes at all. I asked help with something and he immediately said I just wasn‚Äôt strong enough to do it and was doing it wrong. 

He‚Äôs been a good friend and I was catching feelings for him, but this really frustrating. I often feel gaslit, and viewed as just an emotional woman by men. When I express boundaries, I feel like they assume I am just triggered, rather than respecting them. I want to viewed as an equal in a relationship, a true partner and best friend vibe. I want somebody who laughs at my jokes and is willing to compromise or at least acknowledge they could work on something, when I express things I don‚Äôt like.

How to believe someone loves me,1716130734,"I (26F) have been with my husband (30M) for nearly 4 years and got married at the beginning of this year. I‚Äôve always been extremely insecure in our relationship and I felt like he was never over his ex (or basically anyone he had any kind of relationship with before me) and that he settled for me. Admittedly, in the very beginning of our relationship he had inadvertently compared me to his ex. I also read an old journal of his where he went on for pages about how much he loved her and all the things he loved about her. All these years later and being married, I still replay it and I‚Äôve convinced myself he thinks about her and compares me all the time. 

We got into an argument this morning because I had a dream he was cheating on me with his ex, and I asked him if he regrets marrying me. He got very upset and now thinks I regret our marriage because I bring up how I think he doesn‚Äôt love me all the time. He says he can‚Äôt keep defending himself and I look for things to validate the narrative I created. 
I love him more than anything, but I have this intense fear it‚Äôs not reciprocated. He does nice things for me, treats me well, supports me, and the only issue we really have in our relationship is our communication skills (but honestly I know I‚Äôm more of the problem with that) so I have no true reason to feel like this, but I do.

The usual advice I see is to work out and eat healthy whenever I search for advice on this, which is solid, really, but my issue is less how I actually look and more about how I want attention.

I feel like the absence of compliments means I truly am ugly, that my friends look better, that I look like shit compared to everyone.

I'm also single and nobody is interested in me romantically, which does not help the case.

I had close to zero empathy. totally confused weird thought patterns, paranoia, etc etc.

I've been doing lots of research and realizing how fucked my view of reality has always been. Just so many revelations. And now I'm sitting here crying like a little kid like I haven't cried in years, feeling all these emotions and telling myself that it's ok for them to be there. I didn't realize that it's ok to just feel emotions, my instinct was always to push them down and tell myself I was a piece of shit for feeling them...only to let out all my shit onto other people later. I didn't know that I could choose to act in ways that make me feel certain emotions, like doing things I like to feel more content. And I thought I was the only person like me on this planet, turns out I'm human just like everyone else and BPD is just a thing some people deal with.

I don't really know what's going on, I guess I wanted to share my thoughts. I feel really confused. I seriously feel like I don't know anything. I don't really know who I am.

How do I stop feeling guilty? ,1716072649,"I made a post a couple months ago in in January about how I blew up at my younger cousin/brother (I lived with my aunt and uncle for the majority of high school so he‚Äôs kinda like my brother) in a way I hadn‚Äôt really done to anyone before. I was in a really bad spot mentally and it feels like he goes out of his way to make it harder for everyone to do anything and I was so sick of it I just snapped. 

Basically I was watching tv by myself after everyone went to bed because I feel like I can‚Äôt exist around other people even in my own home, so I tend to come out of my room and do things when everyone is asleep or out of the house. My uncle knew I had really wanted to watch my show so he sent my cousin to bed so I could do that. My cousin came out after a couple minutes and I tried to get him to go back to bed and he wouldn‚Äôt. It turned into an argument because he‚Äôd been so insufferable over breakfast I couldn‚Äôt handle it. He‚Äôd had two separate birthday parties, gotten the most gifts for Christmas, and basically winter break had basically been all about him. He also tends to steal my expensive hygiene products and use almost all of it which pisses me off especially because in this case they were Christmas gifts. I was in the midst of losing my mind because I just failed my first semester of college due to a mental health collapse and had planned on ending it all on New Years but hadn‚Äôt (this happened about two days afterwards). I was also suffering from severe rebound anxiety from my panic attack medication. To put it simply I was a neurotic wreck and he was poking the bear. 

Anyways, we had an argument and I snapped after he started throwing dog toys at me (he‚Äôs 12 and I was 18 at the time). I hit him with the same dog toys and told him he was selfish because he couldn‚Äôt let me have one nice thing after having two weeks basically dedicated to him. I have really long nails so I accidentally scratched him with them (a small scratch but I feel bad anyway). Even after that he just threw them back, but then after realizing I wasn‚Äôt going to turn the tv back on he left. It didn‚Äôt even matter because I was too angry to watch my show anyway. I was shaking. Then I went back to my room and cried and debated on going back to the original plan of ending it all. 

I apologized the next day but I think about it a lot since I know I‚Äôm a bad cousin/sister. I didn‚Äôt want to hang out or be with them, but I tried very hard when I first moved in to be as engaging as I was in family gatherings where I was told by my former caretaker to entertain them because my aunt needs a break. When I realized I wouldn‚Äôt be going back to where I was living before I did a 180¬∞ and basically said I wanted nothing to do with them (both my cousins. I get along much better with his older brother because we are similar). 

I hadn‚Äôt thought my cousin cared that much honestly. Didn‚Äôt seem like a big deal to me. He‚Äôd lived most of life his without me anyway.  I just knew I didn‚Äôt want to get attached so I pushed everyone away. I didn‚Äôt join outings or family gatherings or any of that stuff. I‚Äôm going to family therapy with my aunt soon relating to my avoidant behaviors (which she really could‚Äôve brought up when I lived with her instead of now when found out she apparently thinks I don‚Äôt love anyone. This is stupid for a couple of reasons  but that‚Äôs for another post) but I know I‚Äôve already caused some damage. I was never taught how to function in a family unit so I never tried and now I‚Äôm here. 

Earlier today I mentioned about how my younger cousin tried to kick me out of the living room last night and my uncle said he‚Äôs probably still sore about what happened in January. Apparently he brings it up sometimes. I feel bad, but it already happened and there‚Äôs nothing I can do to fix it at the moment. He‚Äôs an abnormally difficult kid (if it wasn‚Äôt for the expense, he would‚Äôve been shipped off to military school) and my other cousin also avoids him like the plague because he starts fights on purpose for crimes such as speaking or entering the room. They tried therapy with him a few years ago but he wasn‚Äôt receptive (my aunt says she thinks he has Oppositional Defiance Disorder but I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs diagnosed). I can try building a relationship when he‚Äôs older and less volatile, but I want to move past this guilt I have about the whole thing. It doesn‚Äôt help me or anyone else, but I don‚Äôt know how to get rid of it.

Last night we had an unpleasant conversation about a very serious topic. After which we sat in silence for a long time, which for him ended up going back to talking about what to order for the apartment and asking me 100 times to tell him something interesting or funny while I could barely hold back my tears thinking about whether to run away, cry completely, or be angry with him. Even after a long time, he started making up some word games to make me relax or when I said I was going to sleep, he asked if I wanted him to read a book to me to sleep.

I think I have BPD and my therapist doesn't want me to have it,1716110541,"I've had 2 counsellors that I'd consider serious, both for around a year maybe more. When I mentioned to both of them that I think I might have BPD the response was something along the lines of:

It's just trauma. You don't want BPD. Most people with cPTSD get misdiagnosed with BPD. 

It was said in a much more professional tone admittedly, but it was always dismissive and not very encouraging or supportive of my self-exploration and understanding. Both times I was told I shut that thought off for like 6 months before my brain started questioning again.

My childhood was fucked and my Mother (potentially father too) had Manic Depression / Bipolar / BPD (she got rediagnosed or something). I doubt it's relevant but due to childhood abuse I have cut my family off entirely.

I met someone amazing recently who suspects they have BPD and they remind me of someone I loved who did too. Naturally, I immediately felt the urge to research how to support someone with BPD and everything I could to understand it. I did, and have started applying it to support my friend. But that voice in the back of my mind was going: ""hm.. interesting.. this sounds.. awfully.. familiar""

I want to bring it up to my counsellor again on Wednesday, but I just see it being dismissed again. Idk if there is any point in getting a diagnosis especially as the NHS can be awful and I could be looking at ridiculous waiting lists. I'm already waiting 6 years to find out if I have autism.

The final point I'll mention is when doing research I came across 2 fun facts that seem to be wildly consistent between studies: 1 - people with cPTSD tend not to self-harm or embody risky behaviours opting more for self-isolation. 2 - people with BPD often get misdiagnosed with cPTSD. The other way around to what I was told.

I don't know why I can't have both or what is so shameful about it, because I reckon I do and with my childhood that would make so much sense.

I asked someone at work why my counsellors said this and among many reasons, one suggestion was that they lacked experience which quite frankly if that is the case, pisses me off. Because how unprofessional is it to deny someone their understanding because you lack understanding? I would have hoped they would say ""That actually is a very valid possibility, I lack experience in that field so I would be more than happy to recommend someone more specialised or advise you to look for someone with experience.""

Then again how unprofessional is all of this. Maybe I'm rewriting all these experiences I really don't know anymore. All I know is since doing this research and meeting this friend my desire to speed down the motorway blasting music screaming my lungs out has been pretty high. 

I don't know or understand BPD or how mine works. If anyone wants to dm and help me explore it go for it. Just no one under 18 because I'm quite sexual and also suicide comes up a lot.

I'm in DBT therapy, taking meds and all, but still I find myself totally flipping out over the smallest things. How do you prevent it from escalating? (For example, I'll get ridiculously angry, he'll seem annoyed/disappointed because he knows it's happening again, I'll tell myself ""he's never going to understand me"", ""this is it, he's gonna break up with me"") Like even when I realize I'm having an episode, I'll just panic even worse because I start to feel like I will never get better and this relationship is doomed.

Any advice would be appreciated. I'm scared to death of losing him because of my BPD. Thank you :)",aveluna,,FALSE,1cvk3u5,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cvk3u5/how_to_not_ruin_my_relationship/
A Question about BPD (My partner has BPD),1716109447,"My partner has Quiet BPD (that's the form that they tell me they have) and sometimes they say things to the effect of ""my BPD will never change"" trying to say that they're never going to get better. They feel pessimistic about their future and don't really have high hopes because of the ways that BPD makes their life more difficult. I do have hope for them but I am having trouble convincing them this. It is hard for us because I don't have any ""proof"" that it can get better, and I don't know how to help them (especially with identity and overall treatment). We are trying to get them into therapy but even so they may not be able to get medications to deal with the mood swings where they are at their age and that specifically bothers them. I personally have dealt with depression and identity (identity issues adjacent to them but not specifically the same, I am trans but they are genderfluid) but I don't know how to help them very well.  
The whole reason I'm making this thread is because I need 1) some success stories to hopefully give them some hope, and 2) to get some advice for how to deal with this day to day and how to help someone with this.

cycles of emotional numbness,1716106895,"I am not officially diagnosed with BPD, I had two therapists in the past telling me I was in the spectrum of BPD but neither of them wanted to ""rely on a diagnosis"" (which is common in my country, it is difficult to get a diagnosis). Maybe I am just a less of a severe case, and a BPD spectrum is actually a thing.

I do experience numbness and emptiness every once in a while. It feels like I lose the meaning in doing anything, get very sad and have zero motivation. This can last from a few hours to a few days. It has been like this for many years now, maybe 10 years. I am now 35.

I am in a 3 year long commited relationship and due to (probably) symptoms related to BPD it has been really hard to be aware of my feelings. In the beginning of the relationship I was in a kind of a limerant state, especially when things between us were unstable. Then it settled in a comfortable and warm feeling. 

My problem is that my feelings are inconsistent. For a few days I feel so lucky to have him, I smother him with hugs and kisses and then I suddenly think that one day he will die and I won't be able to live without him. After that I get a few days of being so numb... I get depressed and uninterested in anything and also lose interest in him and question whether I have ever loved this person.

"Running Away, like always..",1716099883,"I guess this is my attempt to reflect and vent. 

Backstory we were together for over 2yrs in a long-distance relationship (2.5hr drive)


I messed up big with my FP.. Couple weekends ago we made plans and got ourselves an airbnb to spend time together and connect. Day comes and I ended up coming down with a cough, which in result made me extra tired (my sleeping too much on our time together has been a sore spot). Anyways everything we were doing I ended up passing out during; laying in a hammock, relaxing on the bed watching tv, back rubs, most of the first day I slept through. Which she brought up saying it makes her sad - I did not handle this well and ultimately things went downhill and I said ""if your feelings are you're sad bc I'm tired then thats stupid"". She ended up spending an hour outside away from me while I continued to stew in bed.. she came back eventually and had a pillow between us so I didnt attempt to cuddle or anything and just went to bed.  Woke up to her crying and telling me ""i want to go home"", so I started packing up my things üôÉ basically after 2hrs arguing I left. Ran away. When we still had 2days left on the airbnb.

She seemingly forgave me for this as I hadnt left like that before, and given that I promised not to do it again. So I offered to come over the following weekend to make up for the bad one. Things went well the first day.. but the sexond day when night time came and I asked ""if (M) would mind that I stole one of his edibles to watch the northern lights"" and she immediately got upset and asked why? (Context she doesnt like me smoking weed, but said edibles were fine). So i responded ""Nevermind sorry I even asked then"" and went to lay down. She was not accepting of this apology as it was said with a tone and now I was closed off. I apologized several more times, before getting upset we couldn't just move past this and asked that we talk about it in the morning. Nope, we had to talk about it then. So i was overwhelmed and started packing up my things to leave..again. I ended up staying til morning and woke up to a buncha gifts I gave her packed next to my things. When I saw her get up I told her ""I dont want the stuff I gave you back, I dont give gifts just to take them back'. We ended up talking for FOUR HOURS before I finally called it quits when we both came to the conclusion that we dont know what resolve there is to fix this. So I started packing up to leave. She told me ""if you leave again we're done"". I responded ""then I guess we're done."" And made my exit..

We've still been talking bc she wants me to understand and help alleviate this frustration Ive caused.. but it feels like its best to just let her find someone better fitting. It just sucks.. i dont want to be this way. We're both unhappy with the outcome, but there is no fixing whats broken üíî if you made it this far thank you!

I know that underneath these issues we all have lies something truly remarkable and I hope to find it as I get better.

"Straight women with BPD, how do you feel about men?",1716051938,"

**Wondering if this is a common and relatable thing**

Whenever any man is around, I become very hypervigilant. I have to constantly test my attractiveness and flirt just to see if someone catches the bait, they almost always do. In more formal situations, such as school or being in a hospital it‚Äôs more subtle. Though I do remember at 14 when I¬†was in a nut house, my subtle flirting might have not been so subtle since the poor male nurse seemed to get very nervous.¬†

This all stems from sexual abuse since childhood. I¬†was a beautiful child with golden locks, every pedophile‚Äôs wet dream. *Little t trauma*, I‚Äôd say, but the continuity of it wired my brain to see men as something else than human, as predators or preys. There‚Äôs rarely a balance in relationships, for one to go up the other one needs to go down.¬†

I‚Äôm a player, or more like a whore, femme fatale, as my kind of women are seen as. I never want to hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings and I¬†can immediately sense when something is wrong. Yet still, I can‚Äôt help myself. Others breathe oxygen, I breathe male validation and attention. It‚Äôs a game where nobody wins, but I just have to see how far will it go, how good am I at this fucked up game.¬†

The game stops immediately when he gets too close to my skin. Can‚Äôt let anyone under it, it will tear a hole and I‚Äôll bleed out. My brain turns upside down; once such an intriguing dick-alien becomes human with all his flaws and I lose all respect and interest. Then hatred rises.



No,¬†I¬†don‚Äôt hate men.¬†I try my best to appreciate everyone in general, DBT-skills and all that shit. Every man is different with their virtues and flaws.

"metldowns, episodes, moments and shutdowns, I don't know what's wrong with me! :((((",1716092054,"heyy everyone, so I'm 21 female and I'm not officially diagnosed with autism, in fact, it's only something I've started to think about recently, I don't know much about it but my younger brother has a diagnosis.

I already have a diagnosis of complex ptsd, borderline personality disorder, anxiety and depression. I experienced a lot of trauma from the ages of 3-11. I was still throwing tantrums at 8 because I couldn't regulate my emotions and I'm pretty sure I still can't although I can definitely manage/hide it better.

I remember growing up in my teens, I went to an all girls boarding school and I would have these moments, I liked to call them 'episodes', where I would just completely shut down and blast music in my ears, I'd completely ignore everyone and my friends would get freaked out by it because I was non-verbal and if they did talk to me I'd snap at them. I'd sit there with my head against my desk, headphones on blasting music, just swirling with a million thoughts in my head not being able to keep track of my own thoughts and feelings, it would take hours to calm myself down and after all of this, I'd be so mentally drained and physically exhausted.

Now that I'm older, I can manage these episodes better, If i feel myself getting to that point I remove myself from the situation, run to my room and completely break down. The other day, my friend spoke to me in a way that triggered me, I don't know why I got triggered, it's been a long-term issue in our friendship, anyways, she asked me if anything was wrong and I just said no, then we parted our own ways and I went back to my room and started pacing around, then I fell to the ground, started crying uncontrollably and started hitting myself in the leg because I just couldn't deal with my emotions or thoughts or feelings or anything, my mind was racing and every inch of my body felt so tense like I could just explode at any moment. I blast heavy rock music in my ears to cloud the thoughts and feelings because it blocks it all out for me.

I have these episodes a lot, and if I don't get my daily time alone, I start to lose my shit. If I change my routine or travel, it takes me a long time to adjust and I struggle a lot emotionally for the first 3-4 weeks. I broke my phone last year because I got angry and threw it, I've broken a lot of things from being angry and having meltdowns.

Anyways, all in all, I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm 21 and I can't regulate my emotions, like seriously, is it this hard for everyone and will these episodes be something I have to deal with my entire life. I just feel so lost and like there's something wrong with me for having these outbursts. Also, I'm a Gen Z with millennial humour, I understand no Gen Z humour and don't understand the references/jokes my friends make because I'm just not on the internet heaps, I spend most of my time studying, watching movies/shows or literally, I'll spend hours just blasting music in my ears staring at the wall just thinking non-stop about everything and it's exhausting but if I don't do that, I end up feeling like I'm going to explode.",sunshine_aus,,FALSE,1cvfq63,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cvfq63/metldowns_episodes_moments_and_shutdowns_i_dont/
My vulnerability was met with reticent response and I'm the bad guy?,1716092033,"So my spouse moved out of the house to his office (in our property) about 1 month ago, due to my poor behavior (poor emotional regulation and raging when I feel dismissed and unheard).  I stupidly texted him to check on him after he went to his office/bedroom seeming unsettled for an unknown (to me) reason.  A few hours later, I found myself thinking fondly of him and the live he has shown me, so I checked in with him to see if he was any better.  He said he was a bit better and wanted to know what was on my mind.  I confessed to was thinking about him, and checking to see if he was doing any better.  After I vulnerablly confessed I had been thinking about him, his next two responses were reticent two word responses, so I made the poor assumption that my confession of thinking about him had upset him (he goes from hot to cold as quickly as I do these days).  After his two word answers, I responded ""I am guessing my honesty means we are done  talking."" And then I was told I was being passive aggressive and that I had a ""twisted perspective"".  My response was ""It was not meant to be  twisted.  If my interpretation was wrong.  I am sorry."". Then the situation was cleared up and he was off to bed.  He 'called me out' on what he felt was my 'poor' behavior as usual and does not see how his response was dismissive to my vulnerability. He hasn't read any of my responses after that, keeping to his boundaries I'm guessing, but to which one I don't know.  I'm upset that I was dumb enough to text him in my vulnerability only to be met with mono symbol answers and then attacked for misinterpreting them as him shutting down because I had been honest in admitting that I was thinking about him.  Why do I feel like he only sees a black/white view of me, when he constantly calls me out on that?  I hate seeing myself through his eyes when they seem so full of dusdain for me.  I know that I have hurt him but I hate that I see so much  disdain towards me that it makes me doubt that he still loves me.  But if he only feels contempt for me, I can't blame him.  But I keep holding out that contempt isn't all he feels for me, even if that seems to be what I feel most often from him these days.  Maybe I am just being emotionally disregulated or pessimistic or whatever other BPD characteristic that this can be seen as, and maybe it's not.  IDK, my gut tells me one thing but I know he would say another.  I feel confused, accused, dismissed and so very alone in all of it.  Why can't I just do what a normal person would do?  I pray multiple times a day that God will just let me die (since I have promised not to KMS), my bedtime prayer has turned into a plee for God to let me sleep and not wake up.  But I know when my damn alarm goes off, I will still be here, dealing with the consequences of my messed up head.  drowning in sorrow for the life I dreamed of,  guilt & shame for the life I have made because of my own choices.  
Dear God, maybe you will hear my prayer if I put it on line-since my verbal prayers continue to go unmet-  be with my husband and give him peace and healing for the past, the present and the future.  And please let me I fall asleep, and not ever wake up, or heal my broken mind so that I can stop hurting all those around me.

I‚Äôm on 7 meds now (my psychiatrist and I are trying to lessen it but I recently went through a klonopin withdrawal, 2 months since I stopped taking it completely). I‚Äôm on pristiq (for depression), abilify (will be getting off), gabapentin (will going only be taken as needed), buspar (anxiety), hydroxizine pamoate (anxiety),  clondine (for klonopin withdrawal), and just started lamictal (for bpd). 

I deal with panic attacks and major general and health anxiety specifically in the last year when I started klonopin and dealt with the horrid side effects of becoming dependent on it. I feel similarly about clondine as it messes my heart. I haven‚Äôt drink in 10 months (since I got on klonopin but am off now).

I used to smoke a few times a week and it helped alot with my anxiety.

I tried it a few times in the 10 month period and it would usually do that but a few times it went good. I‚Äôm off klonopin now and 2 months post it and was wondering can I smoke? Will it give me the brain on fire effect or the heart palpitations. I have health anxiety since starting klonopin so I‚Äôm worried what it will do. 

And similarly, since I‚Äôm off klonopin, can I drink? I tried drinking once since getting off it and it made my heart race and gave me a headache.

Everything just seems to be going wrong,1716080623,"No matter what I do to get better, it just constantly feels like I fuck things up.

I'm currently on vacation and usually when I travel, I take trips for about 1 week maximum and it's always local to home. But this trip is 3 weeks long (2 weeks in) and across the globe. And I've had a lot of fun. But im.reaching thst point where I'm starting to get angsty, I cant fall into my comforts because I dont have them and I'm getting really overwhelmed. 
My boyfriend (who is such an amazing man) has been unwell the past few days. I ended up spiralling and logged out of all my social media to just remove myself from everything before i said or did something I regretted. But I got a text from a friend saying that he's now in hospital. I feel awful for taking a step back when he probably needed me most. I did it to look after myself but I now feel selfish.

Also, the friend I am on this trip with had plans to visit a particular place today. Its been the thing she's been looking forward to the most on this trip. But after a really bad episode last night, chronic illness which makes walking difficult and a lack of sleep, I made the decision to back out and let her see it herself. I said whilst she was out, it would be really beneficial for me to just have some time to myself for the first time in 2 weeks and some time alone to just ride this out. But now, she won't go. She's upset about not being able to go. And whilst I know logically, I'm not stopping her, it feels like my fault. 

Finally, things are going south with my mum. For context, my mum is terminally ill. I moved out last year, as caring for her full time when she was downright horrible to me was too much for me to handle. Her behaviour, her attitude and her neglect is a lot of the reason I am the way I am  the reason I have to feel like this and the reason I react the way I do and the reason I cant just have a normal day. I need to remove her from my life, for my benefit, but some part of me just keeps hoping she'll come around when I know she won't.

Logically, I know I am doing better. I used to have episodes daily and now, I barely have them weekly. I've gotten better at expressing my feelings and putting myself first. 

But I feel like I fuck everything up and im hurting everyone around me for doing things for myself. 
I dont want this feeling to ruin the last week of my trip. I mean, I'm in Japan for fucks sake.

it doesn't feel fair,1716080129,"me and my girlfriend/fp are long distance, with occasional visits every now and then and it's been fine despite my casual episodes n very hard to deal with disorder. but since we're long distance, i'm often faced with the problem of her hanging out with her friends almost daily while i spend all my time home alone waiting for her to want to either text or facetime me. i understand it isn't healthy but it's so hard to find interest in anything else. (i recently picked ACNH back up and it's been helping me as a distraction/hobby tho!) we *always* facetime at night. there isn't a night where we don't, and she has even claimed that she has trouble sleeping without me on the phone (this goes vice versa).

 but pretty early today she went out with a group of friends, which bummed me out but i got over it pretty fast. feeling more 'hopeful' i messaged her if she wanted to do something tonight when she was home, and i was hit with the text that her group of friends would be spending the night. I feel so miserable and betrayed. i'm self aware enough to know she just wants to spend time with her friends, but i can't help but take it like a personal attack to how she feels about me. it's like she's choosing them over me. like i'm less important. you see these people all the time and me once every few months for 3 days max, why do you *need* a sleep over? i'm most vulnerable at night and i'm dreading being alone by my thoughts. i don't know what to do. this has triggered me and ive been so short with messaging (despite us not texting a lot since again, she's out) it makes me feel guilty. she doesn't deserve this but im angry and want some sort of 'revenge'. erghhh i don't know what to do",kasuarifan,,FALSE,1cvc29s,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cvc29s/it_doesnt_feel_fair/
Family triggers me even more than my FP does since I've gotten medicated.,1716079776,"TW, I do talk about my abuse and trauma in this, mostly about verbal and medical neglect.

It's almost like my family knows what they're doing to me. It's honestly frustrating. I'm almost always the one being neglected or ignored in conversations or at family events. 
And yeah, they were the ones that basically caused this damn disorder, it makes sense! But they apparently don't even know why I want to move into the college dorms so badly this fall???? How do they not see that I'm actively trying to not be around them specifically for extended periods of time??? 

I've always been the one my family put down and at this point I never know if I'm splitting on them or if the anger, abandoned, frustration, and stress I feel about/from them is actually rational. 
Because of that, it's honestly made me so confused with my own splits on my FP(who also has bpd). I feel like I'm going fucking insane at this point.

My family has always triggered me, but ever since starting medication back in February, I've noticed that they trigger me even more than before. I'm not as triggered with my FP, which is honestly a great thing! I haven't had any huge, explosive splits on them since starting my meds. But my family though? I fucking hate them. The parents that I live with have no regard for my food sensitivities(both in terms of the few allergies I have and also for sensory reasons(I'm also autistic btw)) and taste. And my mom(I don't live with her) thinks its a great idea to have 13(now 12) animals in her small-ass duplex and lets her new great dane ""puppy"" piss and shit everywhere and terrorize(not play) the cats. I literally had to grab my cat from there and now one of my friends are looking over her for a few months. Thank god.

My parents always hound on me for not having a job since August of last year, despite the fact that I've been applying for and interviewing for jobs actively since then! It's literally not my fault that the only ""job"" I have right now is Door Dash, which makes me constantly spend more money on gas than I can actually save up. Not to mention, it burnt me out pretty quickly after doing it for two months! They always try to ""help"" by sending me job listings, 99% of them I've either applied to or literally won't be able to do physically due to also being physically disabled! Which brings me to my next thing!

They have absolutely no fucking regard for my physical and mental health at fucking all. They simply think I just have depression and anxiety and thats it. They don't want to even believe that I'm autistic and have ADHD, BPD(which I basically refuse to tell them about, but I'm tempted so they learn how it's caused so they see just how much they fucked me up), DID,  and maybe even Schizoaffective Disorder, which I'm still trying to work out with my therapist if that's another thing wrong with me or not. My parents don't want to even believe that I have POTs or dysautonomia of any kind, hypermobility, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, etc. They don't even believe me when I'm telling them that my vision is getting fucked because it's getting worse way too rapidly for someone my age(21) when there's literally a whole family history of this shit on my mom's side! Not to mention, we know jack shit about my grandmother's physical and mental health related shit on my fraternal side except for that she died of cancer in 2006! My parents refused to do any medical shit for me as a kid and still do now. All they would do was take me to my yearly checkup, the dentist once a year(when you're supposed to go like 2 times a year) and the eye doctor once a year. They don't take me seriously at all. When I was 11, I literally almost died from the fucking flu because of them! They made me stay at home while they went to my sister's band concert. Meanwhile, I couldn't fucking breathe and started choking on my own damn mucus for multiple minutes straight. I was fucking terrified. Now I'm always scared whenever I get sick, even if it isn't as serious as what I had went through. 
There's a reason why I'm not going to be seeing the family optometrist after my most recent appointment. Every medical or mental health professional that my parents would make me go to would gaslight me or brush me off.

Their negligence still holds up today too! And thats what fucking pisses me off! They helped my siblings pay for things for college but refuse to help me because ""I didn't do well in high school, so it wouldn't really be a good idea to spend money on you because we know you're not going to do well in classes."" What the fuck???? Maybe the reason why I didn't do well in school before is because y'all didn't LET me have any accommodations, refused to get me tested for literally anything, always put me down, and fucking verbally abused and neglected me 24/7! 
Just a month ago, I got into an argument with my stepmom and she legit told me, ""Well, you don't have a job and I just want you to have a purpose in life."" Why would you say that to someone?! Let alone your own kid?!

Oh don't get me fucking started on the younger of my two stepsisters(the older one hasn't done shit to me. She's the only one I'm not triggered by.) and how she has lied about me to my parents, aided/aids in my abuse, etc. She basically gets all the love and attention from my parents. They encourage her to do things, to live her best life, etc.

I don't even know if what I'm feeling right now is me splitting on my family or justifiable anger. All I know is that I'm upset with them and that I don't want to live in this damned house anymore. I've been wanting to leave it for years now but was always held back from it for one reason or another.

One night she called me crying hysterically and said that she had been physically attacked by her roommate who I later found out this was her husband way later on in the relationship.

At four months of knowing her I asked her to move in with me. We agreed on 200 in rent. She never paid a single dime to me. 

Said she was depressed, I waited gave her time and she took several trips to yoga retreats. She would come home be happy. I encouraged her if she loved yoga to do it. She failed doing coursework due to not showing up. I found out later this was not her first time failing. She failed once before when she was with her husband. 

Then I found out later that two months into our relationship she divorced him. She said she loved me and bought me a ring. We were engaged at one point.

Then one day I asked her for money for the rent etc. She came home packed up her things and left to go back to her ex husband.

Losing my bf days after psych hospital discharge ,1716063245,"I tried to kill myself last weekend and was hospitalized for a week I have an order to continue taking medication and go to all of my therapy and doctor visits for the next 90 days. The reason I tried to kill myself was from the overwhelming stress of my relationship with my partner we got into a fight after I found a bag full of womens stripper clothes and stripper heels in his car (we have been on and off for the past 4 months or so) after I found it we got into a physical altercation and his phone fell out of his pocket but he ran out of the house and said to just forget about it.

 I ended up trying to kill myself and the police were called they took my phone and his phone and put it in my property, after I was released I turned his phone on and looked through the messages I found a number from a girl so I texted her asking her how she knew him and sent her pictures of the backpack asking if it was hers, she called me yelling saying ‚Äúthis is your bitch?? Say hi to your girl! Speak up!‚Äù And it was my boyfriend‚Äôs voice who replied saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my girl‚Äù he then proceeded to call me crying and out of breath telling me he really liked her and saw a future with her he said she was kind and funny and a genuinely good person he told me I sabotaged his life. I felt bad of course but what hurt me even more is knowing how much he cared about her and knowing he doesn‚Äôt care about me in that way at all. The girl messaged me saying they‚Äôre been having sex no protection and he‚Äôs been sleeping over at her house every night for weeks. 

That night he calls me saying he‚Äôs locked out of his house and he needs me to let him come over so I let him in. we talk for a little and he basically tells me he doesn‚Äôt want to be with me anymore he doesn‚Äôt care if I change or if I follow the 90 days to get help he said he doesn‚Äôt want to try or give us a chance or anything and that he‚Äôs done. 

He took a shower, laid down in bed and we ended up having sex he got up almost immediately after we had sex and said he had to go, he left and after I sent him a few messages he replied back saying he‚Äôs really hurt bc he really liked that girl and now I ruined everything, he said she made him feel motivated to be a better man and she made him feel safe and happy I begged him to come back to my house I offered a massage I offered a bubble bath I offered to leave him alone while he rests and he wouldn‚Äôt come. He said he‚Äôs taking a nap at his house and he hasn‚Äôt replied to my messages or answered my calls.

I'm not even sure what to call it,1716056205," 
Edit for clarification. 
My partner and fp are the same being. 

My fp and partner has suddenly turned on me. 
We have had ups and downs. But in the last 3 weeks, it's been terrible. 
I've got from being the loud one to being the one in the corner just crying and begging for it to stop.  
They have been yelling at me for small things, things that they do to me too. 
But if I bring that up it gets worse.
I get yelled at before my eyes are even open in the morning. 
They have been walking off and leaving me. For many many hours at a time. 
And when they come back it's like stepping around landmines yo not upset them again. 

It used to not be this way. 
I have been a terrible partner in the past no denying that. And I'm still not very good at it now. But I'm fucking trying and doing better. 
They begged and begged and begged for me to start healing myself. But now that I opened up, I can't close the gates again. 
I am genuinely healing. And being better 2ith my actions. Mindfulness alll that junk.
I'm not physically strong and I can be very very hard to de escalate. There's lots of pressure on my partner from life, from me, from other family. 
But I literally have no idea what idenpendence looks like for myself. 

They started getting worse. 
Even though I'm getting better. 
I'm getting screamed at. Being called mean names. Being told I'm worthless. 
Then later they will try and say ""I was just upset I didn't mean it""
I know what that feels like. To say things you don't mean when you're upset. 

One day this week I was left alone after a nuclear bomb of an argument was dropped and I ended up self harming. 
My partner saw and said ""seeing you do that makes me feel like your ex"" and says it makes them regret. 
But not even 24 hours later the same fucking shit is happening. 

I am trying so fucking hard to communicate and talk with them but they ""don't wanna fucking hear it"" or ""can't you ever just fucking drop it"" 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm becoming better, healing my wounds. Being less reactive. 
And I'm still the one getting the shit end of the fucking stick. 

They said they are going to someone else house tonight but refuses to tell me who. 
They know how that makes me feel and think. 
But do they care. Apparently not.

SA, grape, non emotional available parents, verbal/physical abuse from loved ones to strangers, bad romantic relationships, I cut off so many friends due to betrayal and toxicity leaving me with none and I feel like maybe I‚Äôm the issue, about exactly a year ago I met my now boyfriend who gave me a reason for living but I don‚Äôt want to depend on that idea.

 I do have some goals such as going to community college to get into the medical field because I‚Äôd love to help others and enhance my education (something that the average poor funded public high school can‚Äôt do) 

All of my high school was dystopian to my mind, covid hit, I was depressed but I managed to have good grades despite being online for freshman year, did reckless stuff sophomore year- peer pressure and possible things that would‚Äôve sent me to a mental institution but no one ever noticed.
Got into one of the most traumatic relationship with a boy leaving me more fucked than ever, failed some junior year classes but remade up on time (because of that boy harassing me and causing me to lead addiction to SH) but as said I met my now sweet boyfriend, just as I thought I‚Äôd get better‚Ä¶I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis July 2023 (symptoms started March 2023), I couldn‚Äôt move/walk without needing help over the summer.

I am really exceptional at making people feel good.,1716050403,"That's not a brag, it's a reflection on an aspect of BPD that I view as positive.  

I am honestly amazing at making people feel good.  My specialty is when they are not expecting it.  

Someone in the throes of grief or drunk rage or something is beyond my skillset but when I encounter people who are in a more neutral, disengaged mindset or people who actively like me: I have the ability to have them beaming with light in just a couple sentences.  

Yeah, it's a survival skill we developed, so many of us would trade it to be ""normal"" but since that's not an option we may as well love ourselves for our strengths that we DO have.  

I can do emotional judo, as long as I remain calm and centered inside.  It is sooo effective to just listen to what people are saying and accept that it's THEIR truth and I don't have to change their view, I just have to understand they're not operating from the same set of blueprints.  

Instead of fighting them I make clear that I am comfortable listening without having to make it about myself by agreeing or trying to change your mind.  

When I talk to customer service people on the phone I like to challenge myself to make that person's day memorable in a good way.    When I do that the person usually ends up thanking me for talking to them and they mean it!   

SOOOOO gratifying.  

For me the big key that allows me to interact in this way is that I have learned to identify which ""need"" of mine I am attempting to fulfil through another person (it's never deliberate but I catch myself doing it over and over and over) and consider how I can meet the need myself, or at least be very calm and explicit in my request for the other person to meet my need, and (this sucks by is essential) I HAVE to be willing to go elsewhere if the person I want either can't or won't meet my need for ANY reason.  

My needs are mine to meet, and the moment I realize I'm trying to dump my need on someone else I think it's morally imperative to stop, right in my tracks, apologize to the other person, and be willing to engage in whatever internal work I need to do in order to prevent the psychological injuries from my youth from ouching even more people.  

Having the *ability* to show up as a purely loving and supportive being and not feeling compelled to dig up PROOF that people care about me is a game changer.  

I think one reason that gets totally overlooked by the ""partners of PWBPD"" is the degree to which they contribute to our meltdowns.  

Honestly a lot of times our partners are greedy for our love-bombing.  But they know inside that they are never going to go to the same lengths for us because *they* have *barriers.* 

They feel guilty because they soak up all the unadulterated shine and playfulness and (often misplaced) trust until they're just not thirsty for it anymore and then the guilt outweighs the desire for our attentions and then they start finding things wrong with us and start pushing us away.  

Meanwhile we are so starved for ""feeling loved"" that we ignore the signs, and give and give, daring to hope that when the other person's tank is full they will take a turn filling our tanks, so when that's the exact moment they decide we are ""too much"" it's a double punch to the gut.  

So, maybe keep this in mind.  We are not as broken as they like to make us out to be.  

And, yeah.  I know they'll talk about this in their sub, which is messed up because they explicitly exclude us from participating and it honestly is a hate sub and I'm not sure why it's allowed to continue.   They call it ""venting"" but they leave their hate out there for everyone to see, they never post hopeful stories or ""how to take responsibility for their own contributions to the problems.""  It's all just venting, and if they don't want to be considered a hate sub they really should make it private for members only.

supportive partner makes me feel guilty sometimes..,1716048139,"just a ramble/vent about having a supportive partner and how guilty i feel sometimes about it

so im aware im a terrible partner. my girlfriend has been with me over two years (from age 15/16-18) and i have been getting worse over that time because.. that's kinda how the disorder develops.

and im genuinely aware that i am an incredibly bad person and partner as i have split on her so many times over incredibly small triggers. but instead of leaving me she establishes and re-establishes boundaries again and again and always tries to be patient and catch me out when my behaviour is toxic.

instead of reducing me to this monster (which i am) she takes care of me. she's promised me that she'll always take care of me and look after my wellbeing and help me get better no matter how sick and scary i am. 
she encourages me to set my own boundaries and be my own person and explore my own interests. she is proud of me when i use cbt techniques to try to calm down. she is proud of me when i make the right choices despite splitting.

she accepts my apologies, my attempts at getting better.

ive fucking threatened myself with a knife and screamed and bitten and been genuinely really scary (though idk if it's scarier for her or me..) and she genuinely sits there. guides me through putting anything dangerous away. and just holds me and pets my hair and looks after me and calms me down. even when im ugly crying and screaming and backing into a corner. even when im hitting myself. even when i say i hate her. even when i try to run away or isolate myself. she always always makes sure im in a safe place.

i keep telling her that she should probably break up with me but she stays despite everything and im so thankful. i try to make it up to her in every way possible because i really do love her. i really do appreciate having a partner who is genuinely supportive. 

i just feel so guilty for the fact i love her so much and can't show it right. it has to come out in emotional outbursts and hating myself if she isn't around.

she deserves better than me and sometimes i wish she agreed.

"I can't get her words out of my head, and without splitting, I'm left wondering why.",1716045934,"My grandmother's partner and I screamed at each other on the phone the other day. She's said things in the past such as me being too much, too loud, that my grandmother would be disappointed in me if she were here, that I'm selfish and unless I changed no one would love me. She, along with others, forced me into a caretaker role for my younger sibling for a very very long time. Any time I showed a high emotion, I was threatened with inpatient. Any time my younger sibling did, they were recorded and played back to shame them into behaving. 

On our most recent phone call, I cited the fact that she told me no one would love me. She refuted, denied, and finally said I was medicated and delusional, so how should she know it was true? That stung, very very deeply. She stated she was afraid of me because I would get emotional and irrational as a teenager. I wasn't aggressive in any way after my mother passed at 14 (before that I would bite my younger sibling and one time hit a wall until I broke through the plywood), but my younger sibling, who she snuggled and held and praised was frequently aggressive and hostile, resulting in police sent out many times. I was blamed each time, and told I should not have called the police. I should be a better role model, etc etc.

Splitting was my armor, for a very long time. If she was a bad person, then I didn't have to question why she did the things she did- she was a bad person. And that was it. But now, without it, I'm stuck having to correlate how I idolized her growing up, and how she treated me, and I'm left with it running in my head on a loop. It's been days now. All I can picture is us screaming in the kitchen under yellow lighting. The yellow walls of my bedroom. The smell of the house. I can see the wet food bowls for our family cats on the cabinet by the sliding door, as the sun is setting, and her face is red, and she's telling me I'm a dissapointment. 

Any time I would try to defend myself, she would find a way to cut harder and deeper. I gave up. Not just with her, in general. My safety objects and routine would be set alight in my efforts to defend myself, and the breakdowns that ensued were followed by threats to make me behave. My family has admitted to medicating me not because I needed it, but so they could handle me easier. So I was less ""too much"", I guess.

Meanwhile, while I was a child, before my mother and grandmother passed, I would get so excited. She loves driving. She had this truck I loved, and wanted a truck because of it as my first car. She hung pride beads on her mirror, and I would ask her about them, and the truck smelled metallic, and had her work gear piled in behind the seats. She would pile me and my younger sibling in, squashed together, and the necklace would shift with the car. She would do what she could. But she never said I love you. She never hugged me. She rarely praised me. It was often shame. I hated myself, for a very long time. Too loud, too selfish, too naive, too heavy, to skinny, too much. Not enough. 

Splitting was my armor. With it gone, everything is raw and open and I feel like I've been hit harder than ever before. I can't get those things out of my head anymore. My second grade school photo, my old bedroom, the conversations, the late nights. It won't stop. All the boxes they were shoved in tumbled out and spilled onto the floor and I'm drowning.

How much is the chance of saving a relationship with a partner having BPD who doesn't seek treatment?,1716042912,"I (23M) am in a 4months old relationship with my girl friend (26F). Although she's not diagnosed with BPD, she has most of its symptoms such as impulsivity, quick mood shift, emotional instability and fear of abandonment.

Although the relationship is fairly new and we are still in the honeymoon phase; we've already had 4 conflicts due to disagreements on unimportant issues led to temporary disconnections. She gets irritated and angry quickly and instead of resolving the problem via conversation in a peaceful manner, shuts off abruptly.

The blockings have never lasted more than a day and she refollows and reaches out again as soon as the resentment due to outrage is over. Her quick reconnection and willingness to contact or meet after each round of these short-term break ups give me a feeling that she might have dependency issues.

I know that having arguments almost once per a couple of weeks might be uncommon during honeymoon when people show the best versions of themselves or at least address them in a mature way. Specifically for people having BPD, this should be a period with infatuation and tendency to idealize their partner. But the devaluation (though temporary and at not intense levels) seems to have been started rather early.

my journey with substance abuse as a young pwBPD,1716032677,"hey.
I just wanted to share my thoughts on how hard it has been for me to completely let go of any kind of substance abuse in my life.
I did MDMA and smoked weed during my teenage years, also started drinking more and more from when I was 17 years old. 
It became normal to me. 
I moved to another country since last August and basically kicked every bad habit I had, quit smoking, didn't do any drugs, only drank maybe once a month. 
But this is my problem, I always fall back and crash when I allow myself to drink even just a little. A few days ago I had some drinks and ended up doing lines.
Now I have been in a constant state of suicidality and guilt since then. 
I think, at 22, after basically 7 years of on and off ""casual"" but always harmful substance use, I am ready to go fully sober.
I can't consume alcohol casually, because it always leads to me doing something stronger in the end. 
And then I want to kms on the comedown sooo bad.
So yea. If any of you ever feel like you keep falling back into a deeper hole because of some casual alcohol use, I feel you. I am stopping now. 
I have built such a beautiful life in a new country as a student with my fianc√©, who supports me and loves me, that I cannot let such stupid things ruin it all.

Spoke to my mom,1716025760,"Hey y'all, so this week, I had probably the biggest episode in a very long time. And I was sitting here thinking how out of all my mental issues, BPD is by far the worst. So, I called my mom, who while I was growing up, didn't understand the BPD. So, I went down the list and walked her through each and every thing that makes me, me. 

She listened, asked questions, and tried to understand.

We then went into the relationship I have with my kids. I explained that I've done research on how children of BPD folks tend to grow up and view their BPD parent as toxic, and use that knowledge to try and be opposite. I have a 10 year old and a 1 year old. I am extremely open with my 10 year old. She knows every part of my mental health. I can tell her in the morning for instance if it's going to be a bad day, and she will tell me it's ok to have a bad day. My daughter is the most empathetic person I've ever met. I told my mother that the openness and showing her that it is ok to not be ok is how I'm hoping she won't look back one day and be like some folks I know with parents with this disorder. 

But back to my mother, so after an hour conversation about my mental health, she told me she was proud of me. She told me that it's crazy that I did it all alone and apologized for medicating me at such a young age, she thought the doctors were doing right by me. She then told me that I'm a better mother than she ever was to any of her kids. That she wishes that my life before I was adopted by her had been better, and I never had the laundry list of problems that I do, but because of that, and because I have a driving force to become a better mom(not become my egg donor), that she is in awe of me. 

To say I cried ugly tears was an understatement. I have not had a good cry in years, but to hear my mom apologize for the life I went through, and tell me those things and finally hear me was just something I had to share.

We were having a conversation the other day about how if I were to leave the city we live in, it would be a breaking point for her because she does not want a friendship where someone isn‚Äôt around all the time aka accessible.

Mouth swab gene medication thing overseas? (Europe),1716024203,"So, a little context, I'm resistant to most medication. Psych says ""it's my metabolism"". I have a history of trauma, a few diagnosis, two of which are BPD and ADHD.
I figured, along with an ADHD trained psychologist, my depression probably had to come from my ADHD since I tried countless antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, the works. I'm only on wellbutrin because it makes me less hungry. But the fact that it did something at all made me even more convinced I should at least try ADHD meds. But the ADHD psychiatrist (not the psychologist) doesn't agree and refuses to put me on them ""because my BPD symptoms are too severe"". Well yeah, I have extremely bad mood dysregulation which is a symptom of both? So if addressing BPD and trying therapy and other meds didn't work why can't I try addressing the ADHD then?

how to forget about someone who doesn‚Äôt care about you,1716021830,"i met someone in 2022 who i was head over heels for before they broke my heart just a couple months later. i wanted something more and they weren‚Äôt ready and i said i would wait, but unfortunately that never came. it‚Äôs been over a year and a half later and i still can‚Äôt shake the thought of them. every date i go on, i leave feeling sad that it wasn‚Äôt with them. i don‚Äôt know what it is about this person - i just liked them so much. when i was a kid and pictured who i wanted to end up with, this person was exactly them to a tee. the minute i met them, i knew i was going to fall deeply. 

we did text a little earlier this year and they said they had been thinking about me recently and wanted to apologize for acting like a dick. that threw me deep into a spiral again knowing they still thought of me. i have messaged them a couple times since to no avail/response, so now it is back to no contact. i still have them on social media and they watch my stories and like a couple of my pictures.

i just want to be able to move on. i still get excited when they watch my stories because they know what‚Äôs going on in my life. i just wish they would talk to me about it. i‚Äôm sick of feeling so empty over them and wishing i was enough for them. i wish they wanted me. i thought these feelings would go away with time but i still feel the same.

Male undiagnosed BPD ,1716020500,"Hi everyone,

Recently I have been going through alot of shit but my childhood was definatly not any better

But I'll get right to the point, I'm not sure if I have BPD but I show alot of symptoms that I used to have and still have.

I see that alot of symptoms are about shame, self image, splitting, no confidence, highly sensitive with Emotions

In my teens I was also higly addicted to gaming wich I overcome, and my confidence was non existent, with my self image thinking no one even wants to see me, somehow I overcame alot of that shit and am at the point that I know what I look like and have zo much confidence that I sometimes think I'm a Narcisist or something

Of course you guys don't know the context of my life, but I have overcome alot of stuff,  but relationships that's a big thing I still need to work on, This year I split everyone off that I was close to, cus paranoia that I didn't trust them and I felt like they didn't care about me anyways

And they started noticing something on me was well I could tell, they acted safer with me, Wich I noticed and got paranoid from wich caused me to split, I know some girls who have BPD wich I met and they were more interested in me wich got me thinking if I had it.

So i wonder if you can overcome some symptoms of BPD, Cus I'm suprised I have gotten so far if I see how males somehow have a harder time, thought I was just a psypath cus I can't really cry anymore wich also got me suprised, my grandma died wich I loved very much, but I got mad I just could't cry,

Starting to hate my best friend. (advice?),1716019674,"I don't think I truly hate her, but the splitting is too convincing. My paranoia is pretty bad but I'm usually able to understand when it's unjustified, but in these situations, it feels completely rational. She struggles with mental health herself and she tends to not try to hide it at all. It feels exhausting when you feel like you're the only one putting in effort into a friendship when the other person can treat you so coldly one moment and then love you the next. I've gotten so used to this ""cheerful, unconditionally-loving friend"" mask but I'm worn out. 

My final straw was this week. I set a VERY SMALL boundary and she acted so offended. She tends to have a victim complex so this isn't new, but this time she's taken some more extreme ways of making me feel like I'm in the wrong. She avoided me at all costs, not even making eye contact with me. I genuinely wanted to scream in her face and fight her. I've never exploded on my friends because I'm afraid of showing that irritable side that will push them to leave me, but it feels like nothing matters at all. 

I don't know how to confront her without sounding manipulative (not sure if I can if she's able to turn the tables on me so quickly). She's only posting publicly on her social media about things that she'd only normally confide in us about and I think I know why. She's grown close with a guy I've had a thing for but was afraid to pursue (because of my mental health). Initially, I had no worries but because she said it was just null conversation but I can tell her posts are targeted for his attention. She's never acted like this before but I wouldn't put it past her to do something like this when she's upset. Someone who used to be my favorite person has completely changed in my eyes. I'm waiting for some sign that these ideas are baseless but maybe they aren't. I CANNOT LEAVE HER. It would be a shit show for both of us and ultimately we probably wouldn't feel better knowing if one of us wanted to talk shit and share our secrets with others, we could ruin the other's life. Also, we have too many long-time mutual friends. 

We can talk this out, I know it. Getting through that first wall of ""it's not my fault"" is going to be difficult though (for both of us).

 Deep down, I love her. She's one of the best people I know and we get along so well, but I can't keep enduring hot and cold behavior while resisting my own INTENSE mood swings. I seem like I take jokes lightly but when I'm told over and over that I'm mean and unkind, it drives me insane. Do you have any idea how much shit I put up with everyday with you especially?

I want to confront her but I don't know how and when to approach her. It feels like I'm constantly walking on thin ice around her. I understand her life is hard, but at least she doesn't hide her mood the way I do EVERY SINGLE DAY. I'm not asking that she bottles it up, I just want her to communicate when she's irritable so that I can avoid upsetting her in some way. 

It's just insanely frustrating when someone is acting like the victim over something small and then playing on your fears of being abandoned. I don't know how to word my confrontation in a way that can appeal to her, convey my feelings, and also not scare her away and make her play defensive.

This is mostly venting but advice on how to communicate such a tricky subject is absolutely welcome.",swaggermcjagger_1,,FALSE,1cuse4p,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cuse4p/starting_to_hate_my_best_friend_advice/

This is a feeling I've struggled with for a longggg time. While it's not a consistent 24/7 feeling, it still feels so heavy when it happens. It makes sense that this feeling is attributed to anxiety/depression, but when it occurs it genuinely just feels like I do not belong on this planet. The heartache of just everything just hits like a freight train.

How do you deal/cope with a sudden breakup having BPD? ,1716016684,"Until this morning, I was in a happy relationship with someone, but then I woke up (my sleep cycle is messed up, I know) to read a text from my (ex?) boyfriend saying that he thinks it's better if we're just friends.
 
These past few days have been a bit awkward, yes, but for external factors. Nothing to do with us as a couple.
If fact, last night before he went to bed, we had a nice talk about us and about what was going on and we solved (or so I thought) things and agreed these external factors weren't going to grt between us. 

He is aware that I have bpd and since he's a therapist he always knew how to treat me and what to say etc. 

I don't really understand why he would want to suddenly break up with me just like that. I'm honestly devastated and have been crying non-stop all day. I don't understand and everything just hurts so much. 
I don't resent or hate him (I'm not the ""typical"" borderline [you kkow how people think we are/stereotype us] that gets angry, I just always get really depressed).

We broke up 5 months ago but I still wanna take revenge. Should I do it or am I splitting?,1716015732,"We dated for 3 years and it was chaotic, I regret with all my heart having met this person. I used to be confident, funny, had it all figured out career and life wise, always had a smile on my face and loved making other people smile as well. Until I met this guy.

I fell head over heels, I thought this guy was the one and gave my everything to make it work.

He eventually started screaming frequently, insulting me: ""stupid"" and ""bitch"" were his favourite and became normalized. He started punching walls, literally ripping off the shirt on his body in anger and I would end up by apologizing and making things his way. There was always something wrong with what I would say or do that would lead to these awful anger outbursts. I eventually got pushed on the floor, slapped and got a knife pointed at me. He would always say ""you made me do this"".

Needless to say, my confidence went to shit. I started being afraid or speaking up and doing things without consulting him. I would even ask how he wanted the tomatos to be cut! I didn't trust myself to do absolutely anything, because I knew I would get him upset if I did things my way (even the smallest things).

My levels of anxiety skyrocketed, I lost weight, my hair started falling, I started walking on eggshells at all times, I became afraid of doing absolutely everything and it was starting to get noticed in all aspects of my life, including work, in which I had achieved so much and was so respected.

I started under delivering at work because my mind was not in the right place, I lost my drive, my confidence and autonomy. Suddenly I could no longer speak up, be creative or even do a task without a lot of guidance, which is shocking because it's like I'm a different person and I know everyone can tell, but it's like part of my brain shut down.

The only one I‚Äôm attracted to anymore is my imaginary boyfriend of 6.5 years. I might not get married bc of this. Which means no sex ever in this.

Shit, it‚Äôs not even a matter of not getting approached. I do get approached. I‚Äôm considered attractive. But I want HIM. but I can‚Äôt have him. And I don‚Äôt want sex bc I‚Äôm too afraid of it.

My husband and I have been together almost 20yrs (19 1/2), and married for 15 ‚Äòn 1/2. He is also the only man I have ever dated, or been with, and I hold that dearly. He is ‚ÄòHigh functioning‚Äô (I hate that terminology) with ASD, as are our 3 with kiddos. One with level 1, 1 varying between level 1 & 2, and one with level 2 with mild intellectual delay on higher end of spectrum. The youngest also has PVL brain damage due to hospital trauma, and mild cerebral palsy, as a result.

It has been a very traumatic time for all of us, for the last couple years, especially when living with in-laws. In the last 8mos I have dealt with back-to-back intense traumas‚Ä¶From assault (NOT HUSBAND), both verbal, and physical, then my dad died on Christmas, and then my pseudo dad 1mo and nine days later, then my nephew 3mos later (grandson of pseudo sister and dad)‚Ä¶oh, and we all almost died in 2022 by way of tidal change drowning.

This brings us to the issue. We live away from my home area, in his childhood area of like 600 pop. I have had zero friends since we moved in 2020‚Ä¶going on 2yrs, his BFF moved local‚Ä¶super local‚Ä¶and husband seems to want to spend time with anyone, but me‚Ä¶

I feel SO isolated, and that steals my breath away. It just hit me that outside of the short time he didn‚Äôt have friends, he seemed to need me and really care. This got me thinking that it has really always been like this (he is a gamer and makes music), I just used to have friends to pull me from my head. Now, he just seems he is so happier when I am absent, and I have nobody else. He is trying in the most basic of ways, but avoiding accountability at all costs; whereas, I go out of my way on that front, as I never received it. 

Someone recently referred to me as ‚Äúthe bottom of the totem pole‚Äù, and it hit‚ÄîHARD. I always go above and beyond to acknowledge what I did that was wrong, make a genuine apology, and work on change. Yet, every day. I am left alone.

I feel unwanted, and like he only holds on due to our ‚Äúvows‚Äù, and codependency.

Well, lately I have noticed I have been saying I love you back, much less; as all this hurt has really been boiling for a long time, now that I can see it. He never validates.

Anger stops me from doing anything it's become paralyzing I'm afraid of myself,1715990576,"So I feel like litterally almost everything I need to get done I have this shitty feeling like I dont want to do it, I know why its cause I'm scared il get triggered into an anger outburst or worse yet a rage.  I feel like I just cant handle any extra stress and as soon as I try to take care of whatever it is I start losing my shit.

Example: me and my daughter are going camping this weekend with friends, my friend just told me last night so we have little notice. I need to pack everything, my stuff is an absolute mess in storage, me trying to find something and unable to= snapping out. Why dont I just organize my stuff since not being able to find something is a major trigger? The reason I dont organize my stuff again is fear of my anger and frustration, as soon as I try to organize my stuff I get this overwhelming urge of anxiety cause it's just so much stuff, then I cant think, then again I snap.

Luckily I can keep my anger in control when I have my daughter (which is only weekends) still though I will feel like I'm boiling inside ready to erupt like a volcano, then I get really hot, then 30 mins later after that surge of energy i spiral into a self hating sort of depression and energy drought since i just used it all.  Then comes the internal voices of what someone always said to me when I was a kid ""what's wrong with me"" they would say you. This is usually combined with ""your a loser"" to myself, they never called me a loser as a child just an angry look ""what's wrong with you"" pretty often.

Anyway just had to vent this, if you read this thankyou, if you go through something similar please share, if anything works for you any advice helps. I'm litterally frozen in fear of myself.

how do you guys deal with jealousy? ,1715985724,"hello fella BPDers! F, 19 ENFP here, dating an ISTP, M, 19.

let me break down a little bit of contest here. me and this amazing guy are long distance, currently on talking stage but might start dating within next week because we are meeting irl in his hometown.

since it's his first love story i tried to dissuade him about dating me, because his first relationship should be with someone who lives near, and not with mentally ill person. 

and although he seems pretty willing and committed in building something together, i stated that if he ever meets someone that lives near him he nurtures interest in to, i would let him see that person (ouch).

he has reassured me that he is not planning on to doing that nowhere in the near future. however some friends we share in common invited him this weekend on a night out with some boys and there will be girls too, and when I asked to tell me if something happens, he said ""yes"". does this mean he has changed his mind about not seeing anyone else? or am I reading too deeply into shit?

notice that he has asked for my permission to go out with these folks, and i obviously consented since, yk, it's his right - as everyone else's - to have interpersonal relationships with people other than me, 

however i am currently shitting myself and even spiralled into a very bad episode - today I had a huge panic attack, probably almost risked er lol.

so! give me your brutally honest, harshest, not at all sugar-coated opinion and please please please, suggestions are accepted and welcomed!!

I love him but I need help,1715982117,"My husband has bpd. He also has autism, is California-sober, and has childhood trauma. He‚Äôs been to the hospital more times than he can count and twice since I‚Äôve known him. We‚Äôve been together for 3 years, been married for 8 months.

He was diagnosed with bpd before we met, but he didn‚Äôt fully embrace it because he felt that his autism could explain his symptoms. He was diagnosed a second time during his last hospital visit, and while he hates the concept of ‚Äúpersonality disorders‚Äù, he has begrudgingly accepted the diagnosis. 

I think I have approached this the wrong way up until now. I‚Äôve dealt with his diagnosis as *his* problem; something that *he* has to deal with. But now I think I need tools to help me understand what he‚Äôs going through, and I need to know how to react properly to him.

Here‚Äôs what I experience on a seasonal basis: he gets bored and wants to hyperfixate on a new expensive hobby (owning exotic pets, buying sewing machines, vintage cameras, etc). These cost money and take away time from him, and sometimes pile additional responsibility onto him. He starts getting overwhelmed, and cuts himself (surface cuts). We will get into fights because the apartment will get messy and I‚Äôll have to pick up after him. These fights are usually over text and can spiral out of control. I‚Äôm not completely innocent either. I get really defensive, and can take what he says to heart. After a fight, we will make up and he will agree to give up the hyperfixation hobby. Twice this ended up in a hospitalization, but that was before he was sober.

He is on meds, and we‚Äôve started seeing a couples therapist, but we haven‚Äôt touched on bpd quite yet. I‚Äôm currently entering another hyperfixation stage with him, but it seems like this time everything is happening at once: he wants to get another pet (either a dog or a snake), he complains that he‚Äôs overwhelmed, and he‚Äôs being extra-sensitive to criticism. 

We had an argument last night over something small (he was eating his dinner on top of his laptop, and I told him to not do that). He got defensive and yelled at me for being critical. This time I didn‚Äôt escalate it. I simply stated that I didn‚Äôt like to be talked to that way and I went to bed. This morning I noticed he had fresh cut marks on his arms and stomach. We tried to have a nice morning together, but he kept being rude to me because of more perceived criticisms he thought I was making. I told him that he was being rude to me, and he rolled his eyes at me and said ‚Äúok‚Äù. I know he‚Äôs struggling, but I feel like he uses me as a punching bag. In that moment I left the room and cried by myself. And now he‚Äôs texting me about how he wants a new pet again, pretending like our morning didn‚Äôt happen.

I need help. I want to be supportive but also want to be respectful of my needs, but I have no idea how to do that or what that looks like. How do I bring up things that bother me to him? How do I react when he wants to get into an expensive hyperfixation hobby that‚Äôs doomed to fail? What do I do when I see fresh cut marks on him?

Any tips on how to deal with this situation?,1715975709,"Hi there.


A very dear friend of mine struggles with BPD and recently, I just don‚Äôt know how to deal with it anymore. 


Here‚Äôs the situation: We met a good while back and bonded very quickly over our shared mental health struggles and the challenges we both experience in uni. I immediately felt super comfortable with her and when we are together, she always tells me that she also really enjoys talking and being with me.


The problem is that in between our meetings we never really talk. She goes quiet for months at a time, not responding to my texts and basically completely ignoring me. And when she ‚Äúpicks up the line again‚Äù so to speak, she acts like nothing happened.
I really get that at times responding to messages and meeting up with friends is really hard, especially when you are struggling (I have enough experience on that front, believe me) but somehow over the last few months I have been continuously feeing like this is a friendship of convenience for her. Whenever she texts me, I try to answer as soon as possible (so she doesn‚Äôt feel rejected etc), but she won‚Äôt even acknowledge months that have passed in between her texts‚Ä¶ I myself struggle with depression, anxiety and pretty intense rejection sensitivity due to my adhd so I know that I might be overreacting, but I even if I rationalise this feeling, I just can‚Äôt get rid of it‚Ä¶

Struggling and I don‚Äôt even know what I need or what to do. (TW: small mention about substance abuse),1715973845,"I went through a breakup I was not expecting a month ago, I felt extremely betrayed by what happened. He was the first person I ever thought I was in love with, I was in love with who I thought he was at least. I made it through, somehow. 

Then over the past few weeks I went on four dates with someone and they told me yesterday that they weren‚Äôt interested. I realized when we were talking about what we wanted that maybe even though I didn‚Äôt and don‚Äôt want my ex back, that I‚Äôm not over what happened and getting used to someone new seems a bit weird. They had also mentioned they would never date someone with BPD again (talking about an ex), which I thought was unfair considering there are so many different combinations and levels of severity. I had never told them that about me but now I'm paranoid that it‚Äôs obvious to everyone else even though I am usually pretty good at hiding it with others especially new people and I am trying my best and have been doing pretty good with managing external behaviours with others. They also seemed to have their sh*t together and even though I work full time, have a car, and have a social life, I still feel as if I could and should be more ahead (better paying job, career). So that kind of made me feel unworthy as well? I usually don‚Äôt care whether or not someone has their ducks in a row to consider being friends with them or not, as long as we vibe and there is mutual respect.

I feel as though I never feel wanted enough unless I am dating or in a relationship. And I want to value my friendships as much as romantic ones but I struggle so much with it. Maybe its because I believe deep down that I am only a worthy person if someone wants to be with me romantically (because society seems to value that and therefore a lot of people think this way?).

It‚Äôs the long weekend here and my best friend is away but even when I saw her yesterday and discussed the dating situation I still felt so misunderstood even though I feel safe with her. I have some things planned over the weekend with some newer people and people I‚Äôve known for a bit to keep me busy but also maintain and make new connections (because I think that‚Äôll help in the long run).

I try to distract myself with TV shows, music and engaging in forums about these things. But it is getting nice outside and it‚Äôs reminding me of how lonely I am because of these activities available to me that I don't feel I have anyone to share them with. I feel like I‚Äôm just a placeholder within friendships. I want to get out in the community but I live in a smaller city so there aren't a whole lot of community events tailored to my interests. And even then I am so anxious I get nervous about approaching people, how to interact without being too much. I‚Äôve gone to local music shows by myself and have wanted to engage with people but no idea how.

Over the past day when I talk to people it‚Äôs as if the words are coming out of my mouth and I'm engaging but I‚Äôm not present.
I have my second session with a therapist this coming Wednesday who specializes and DBT and EDMR. I‚Äôm not sure if that's what I need but I feel it‚Äôs a step in the right direction.

I‚Äôm trying to quit using cann*bis because I know it‚Äôs only a short term solution. I use it because it‚Äôs the only thing that helps me not think and calm me down that doesn‚Äôt require me needing energy for it to work.

I‚Äôm not sure where I‚Äôm going with this but if you read to the end, have advice, or relate, I‚Äôd really appreciate someone reaching out.

we loved each other more than anything, he was my everything actually. we would see each other on weekend and some wednesdays. his family loved me and mine accepted him. in april, we ""broke up"" but it was most like a break. i mean, 2 hours after our break up we came back together. and then during the holidays i went to morocco. it was hard and i did not wanted to go, because being too far away from him was too hard. i learned to live with my bpd and he learned to live as someone's favorite person but it was still hard for us. we had some fight, and when i came home we talked a lot. we knew it was our end. 

i think it all started when i first talked about s3x and the fact that we stopped doing intimate stuff, we stopped doing s3x and i don't know everything was off. he just said ""you're right"" and he was agreeing with me and i just knew we were breaking up. so the next sunday he came to my house with all my stuff. clothes, plushies, the bracelets i gave him... we cried a lot in each other arms. it was hard because we actually were still in love. i never loved anyone like this before. we broke up because he wanted to stop suffering. it was too hard for him. 

so i'm coming to the point where i started to talk to a lot of guys, i drank a lot and i c/t myself, i did a lot of bad things and i was at my worst. i still do some stupid shit actually but it's not the point. 

he said to me that he wanted us to try again in the future, after his exams, after everything. he's the type of guy that want to experience a lot of things. and we almost broke up because of this once.

But there's one thing that to this day I still cannot handle and is hindering my life and my friendships. 

When I hang out with my friends who also happen to be couples, I basically lose my sh\*t. I end up ditching the hang out session early sometimes, just having an excuse for why I have to leave, and having breakdowns (rarely in front of them, but usually before or after hanging out). The thing is, it's not really due to jealousy because I am in a stable relationship, I just constantly feel some sort of way that's like: ""*I feel like I'm intruding on this couples space and time, and I shouldn't be there, they don't want me there, I have to leave, they deserve to have their space without me*"" and so on. And even if people tell me I'm ok to hang out with them, I cannot ever shake these thoughts away, and I have to leave. I think deep inside, aside from the intruding feelings, I feel as if I wish people would want to spend time with me without also bringing someone who is obviously more important to them than I am to them, which is obviously toxic as hell to think, but I can't ever not think this.

Everything is too much,1715950987,"I (25F) have been diagnosed with BPD back in 2021. I used to have depression and behavioral problems since I was a little kid. I have a difficult family and live in a household full of screams and conflict constantly. Nevertheless, everything used to be quite okay after my teenage years until now. I did well in college, had an amazing boyfriend and a stable life. I somehow had a BPD breakout after leaving this relationship and leaving my house where I lived alone and ended up being hospitalized for half a year. Since then, everything has been going downhill. Even though I studied a career, a master and a pg, I can‚Äôt seem to get into anything because I am missing experience or my grades are too low for getting into a PhD (bear in mind that I struggled with mental health during my whole life I still managed to work and study, I was considered ‚Äúgifted‚Äù before my diagnosis). The economic situation in my country makes it really difficult to move out or have a decent job (not to mention working as what you studied) so I just live by shitty jobs where I am constantly mistreated. 

Due to my illness, I have been isolating a lot and pushing people out of my life. I am trying to get out of my country but everything is so difficult and I constantly have new health problems and other stuff that just seems to add up. I have a boyfriend with whom I have quite a toxic relationship and I feel constantly invalidated by him, doesn‚Äôt allow me to feel bad and feels like I am too much and what he does is never enough, but he doesn‚Äôt let me vent or be sad. My family doesn‚Äôt accept him because they think he mistreated me, but I just think I am quite difficult  and I have the love I deserve. He used to have very toxic behaviors that I have now internalized and never had. And I feel so alone and misunderstood‚Ä¶ I remember having a good relationship and this was not how it went and how I felt.

Everyday I have a new problem and people just think I am crying too much (debt, health issues, legal problems, my family battling illnesses and poverty)‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt seem to find a place where I belong, in any sense. I should be having an amazing life because they told me I was gifted and also I did so much with my condition, but I cry myself to sleep everyday and before working, and have such a strong pain in my chest sometimes I just wanna hurt myself phisycally not to feel so much‚Ä¶ I have had 3  attempts and somehow I am still here and I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt.

Fuck my mental health ,1715948553,"[19 F]
Navigating a relationship since I was just 14 and he was 18, meeting online, and then finally getting to hang out in person was like a dream come true. We shared everything, from silly inside jokes to deeper fears and anxieties. But my constant battle with anxiety and panic attacks was always lurking in the background, casting a shadow over our otherwise happy moments

When a stressful family event hit, I felt like I was drowning. I couldn't handle the pressure, and I resorted to self-harm. It was a dark and scary time, but I knew I had to reach out for help. Confiding in my mom was the first step, and before I knew it, I found myself in a mental hospital, with my boyfriend by my side, holding my hand and telling me how proud he was of me for being brave enough to seek help

But the road to recovery wasn't smooth sailing. The medication they gave me at the hospital made things worse before they got better. My panic attacks became even more intense, and I felt like I was losing control. I turned to my boyfriend for support, pouring my heart out to him about how tired I was of fighting and how I just wanted the pain to end. And then, out of nowhere, he dropped the bombshell..he was breaking up with me... (also before my birthday)

I felt like the ground had been pulled out from under me. The one person I thought would always be there for me had turned his back on me when I needed him the most. And to make matters worse, his mom, who had always been so sweet to me, suddenly cut me off completely. It felt like I was losing everyone I cared about, and it sent my panic attacks into overdrive

In the midst of all this chaos, I turned to therapy and medication for some semblance of stability. And slowly, ever so slowly, things started to improve. But despite the progress I was making, I couldn't shake the feeling of longing for my ex-boyfriend. I wanted to show him that I had changed, that I was getting better, but every attempt I made to reach out to him was met with silence or rejection. Started telling me how he doesn't think about me anymore and even if we would get back together he might loose one of his best friend ... And he also called me a narcissist.. :(

I'm trying to push forward but it's getting harder and harder... I'm sorry for doing the stuff I've done and I'm sorry for being like this ... I'm really trying to get better ... I still love him A LOT and I'm sorry for being impulse and trying to send him messages now even though he doesn't wanna hear from me anymore...I miss him ....

He makes suicide threats?!,1715944518,"Edit: Just found out he‚Äôs now in a relationship with his ex girlfriend who is the girl he told me not to worry about lmfao 

So I‚Äôm very uneducated on BPD and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve came here to share my story of what I‚Äôm currently going through because I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy and it‚Äôs fucking with my head.

F25 M25

I would really appreciate some advice and I don‚Äôt mean to judge people with BPD (I‚Äôve met some absolutely beautiful people who suffer with this and my heart goes out to them I‚Äôve made life long friends who suffer with this) but this just my story of what I‚Äôm currently going through and would love some insight and advice.

My ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù has BPD, Autism, ADHD.

At the start it was amazing, he walked me home, made me feel loved, understood my childhood trauma and he would always be an ear to talk to and would be there for me 100%.

A few months down the line he started to become distant and I feel like he‚Äôs fucking with my head.

Whenever I would try and hug him he would pull away and laugh cracking jokes like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt touch me‚Äù but then two minutes later he would pull me into a hug.

I would try and kiss him and he would turn his face away and laugh and then two minutes later he would kiss me.

I would try and make a move and he would pull away and laugh but then call me frigid and say I don‚Äôt show him affection like wtf.

But other than this he was still great, we had our ups and downs.

A few months ago he went off the rails with drinking and self harming, I offered to give him some space so he could be alone and deal with it and he would say I don‚Äôt care about him, so I tried to help him and sat with him at hospitals, got him into ambulances and then he would say I‚Äôm too much and need to let him help himself he doesn‚Äôt need my help like wtf so I never knew what to do or how to help because I would either be pushed away or told I was too much.

Then he would tease me about other girls to see my reaction, I‚Äôd obviously be jealous and hurt and he would laugh and call me insecure, but if I played along and called the girls hot he would give me the silent treatment and say I don‚Äôt love him and become cold towards me.

Few weeks later he out of the blue said he was confused about if he wanted to date me, so I gave him some space as he then ghosting me.

I told him I would wait for him no matter how long it took and I wouldn‚Äôt give up on him and I only want him.

But then he came back and love bombed me, would call me baby and refer to me as his girlfriend but then we met with some friends, he said infront of everyone that we were no longer dating and just friends which was news to me and it broke my heart.

So I got up and walked home without saying a word, he then messaged me hours later asking if I got home safe and to meet him later to hang out like nothing happened.

So I ignored him and left him on read as the whole thing was fucking with my head.

Last night was the final straw for me, it‚Äôs fucked with my head and it‚Äôs driving me insane.

So for context he knows nine months ago I lost my mother to cancer and watched her die infront of my eyes.

Last night he texted me saying he bought two bottles of bleach and was going to drink them, so I obviously panicked and begged him to tell me where he was.

He kept saying things like

‚ÄúNah I ain‚Äôt telling you where I am‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll be dead soon‚Äù
‚ÄúMy phones going to die so I can‚Äôt talk‚Äù
‚ÄúStop asking me where I am I want to die‚Äù

So I got scared and searched for him for four hours in the rain crying my eyes out, because I couldn‚Äôt save my mother but I had the chance to save him from dying.

I told him to get some help immediately else I‚Äôll be the last person he talks to and I can‚Äôt have that resting on my conscience.

Four hours later I found him sat on a bench laughing watching tik toks on his ‚Äúdead‚Äù phone, I looked at him and he just had a childish smile on his face.

Me: You ok
Him: Yeah what‚Äôs up
Me: Did you drink it
Him: Yeah (then he smirked)
Me: Can I call an ambulance
Him: They came and drove off because I refused to get into the ambulance

I smell bullshit, they have a duty of care and if they know someone has tried to end their life surely they would contact the police and have him detained and mentally assessed.

Me: Go to the hospital please else you‚Äôll die
Him: Nah
Me: But you could die in your sleep
Him: Good

He then had that same childish smile and turned away from me and continued watching his tik toks so I walked away and I‚Äôve blocked him on all social media‚Äôs.

He didn‚Äôt drink that bleach, it‚Äôs clearly a lie.

Why would he lie about that and have me running around crying my eyes out, I feel so fucked up in the head from it.

He love bombs and then ghosts me, he jokes about drinking bleach, he plays hot and cold (understandable as he has trauma), acts like I‚Äôm a ghost then he‚Äôs clingy as fuck.

Did I do the right thing by walking away and blocking him, I love him to the moon and back but he‚Äôs very difficult to be with I feel like he‚Äôs playing mind games even if he knows it or not.

I did everything for this dude but he wasn‚Äôt the person I fell in love with.

I‚Äôm hurt that he embarrassed me infront of friends by saying we‚Äôre just friends after I begged him to just give me a yes or a no and then he love bombs me just to say that to our friends and humiliate me.

I‚Äôm hurt that he joked about drinking that bleach because that‚Äôs not funny at all, it‚Äôs sick.

I‚Äôm confused and absolutely heartbroken, he went from being my best friend to being a complete nasty stranger and it sucks.

I‚Äôm absolutely broken, I loved him with every part of my soul.

He‚Äôs made me feel like a lump of shit on the floor, completely worthless and used.

I know it‚Äôs crazy but I‚Äôd still take him back even now, because when he‚Äôs good he‚Äôs amazing but when he‚Äôs cold he‚Äôs awful to be around.

Just feel lost.

I did everything for him, was there 100%. I watched documentaries on BPD, I went to his therapy to understand him better, I sat with him and watched his bags while he slept when he got kicked out (not his fault).

Just need some advice as to why he acts this way especially with the ‚Äúsuicide threats‚Äù, how can he do that to someone.

For example atm I‚Äôm unemployed again, 27, single, never dated, overweight, barely surviving financially, stuck living with my Mum and general just feeling down on my luck.

I do try and fight my depression.

Yet I feel like I‚Äôm fighting a losing battle due to just life being shit.

ppl often took advantage of me, and i never really saw how horribly forgiving i was until i got stuck with my first love for 3 years. i was 14 when we started dating, and to sum it up, he cheated constantly, sexually and psychologically abused me again and again, and he also hit me. i was also raped by my ex best friend‚Äôs boyfriend. she was my best friend for 13 years, and she left me cus she blamed me for it. my other best friend, my first love, my mom, and my other friends blamed me too. around the same time my mom got admitted into the hospital for 2-3 weeks because she caught pneumonia while being under chemo (she was diagnosed w/ cancer when i was 15). it was only me and my mom who lived together cus both my siblings and my dad were in the states cus of work. my dad blamed me for her being sick too. at 17 i fell in love with someone new, and he was perfect. he was the one that made me realize that the abuse, cheating, the rape, my mom‚Äôs cancer, and my friend‚Äôs leaving wasn‚Äôt my fault. but because of that, everything came crashing down for me. for 5-6 months straight i became an alcoholic, i was constantly crying, felt empty, kept picking fights with him, the flashbacks and nightmares started, and i was so suicidal. he was the one who convinced me to see a therapist. but eventually, he left me after a year cus i became so toxic; was constantly angry and i always broke up w/ him then came back regretting it. i also attempted back then, and when i survived it, i got threatened to have my mom locked up and for me to be deported cus apparently it‚Äôs illegal. now im with someone new and we‚Äôve been together for 2 years, but i can sense how tired he is with my mood swings, my anger, everything.

i miss the person i used to be. before all the symptoms showed up. i‚Äôm not saying this to brag at all, i mean i dont see myself as any of these anymore. i was a straight A student, a hopeless romantic, an active student, i had so many passions (music, dance, art, reading, writing, public speaking, etc.), i was a popular kid in my high school back then (but not the mean kind), and everyone described me as this extremely bubbly and kind-hearted person. now, my memory is just not trustworthy anymore with all the disorders that pretty much ruined it, so im not even a straight A student which sucks cus im premed too so i need good grades. i no longer believe in true love because i cant wrap my head around the fact that someone would want me beyond my body. i dont participate in extracurriculars anymore, i lost my interest in the many passions i listed down, and im no longer this bubbly and kind person. i just have so much anger inside me cus all i keep thinking abt is how unfair everything is. i cant trust anyone anymore. not even me cus i dont even know who i am anymore.

im so exhausted honestly, and whenever i try to open up to someone abt how tired i am, i can never explain it in a way that they understand how extremely exhausting it is. the constant and unbearable pain that no matter how happy i convince myself that i am, deep inside i just feel this huge hole that just feels like my heart is constantly sinking. the worst part is when i have a hypomanic episode then all of a sudden a huge crash js happens cus of how easily hurt i am. i hate how terribly im treating my boyfriend too. i want so badly to just be able to show him i love him without subconsciously pushing him away cus of how scared i get that he‚Äôll end up treating me the way that everyone else in my life treated me. i‚Äôm so scared to lose him too, but with how unstable i am, i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he gets exhausted with me. i just want it to be over. 2 years in therapy and i feel like the pain is js never gonna end. 

anyway, im sorry this was such a long rant. i dont even mind if no one bothers to read it. i just really needed to let it out. ",National-Pirate1810,,FALSE,1cu05ii,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cu05ii/i_feel_like_life_itself_wants_me_to_give_up/
age regression attachment c-ptsd and bpd,1715933702,"Heyyy, 

So my names Ash, I‚Äôm turning F21 in September. I‚Äôm currently in my second year of uni and live at a residential college. 

A bit about my background, I grew up in a very dysfunctional family, my mum is a drug addict with psychosis, my dad passed away by suicide before I was born and my step-dad sexually abused me for most/all of my childhood. I was eleven when I went to the police and told them what was happening, after that I was placed in long term care with my carer (nan) and she was not physically abusive or unsafe but just very emotionally and psychologically abusive. 

In year 7, after I had just been placed in care, I got very attached to my year 7 teacher, let‚Äôs call her Melissa, I was an eleven year old dealing with major ptsd and no support was given to me, anyways, I told her I loved her and wanted to be with her, obviously now when I look back I just wanted her to be my mum because I didn‚Äôt have one anymore, but as an eleven year old who spent the ages of 3 - 11 being molested, I thought it was normal to express love that way, anyways, she ended up filing a restraining order against me, expelling me and I got a formal caution from the police for harassment and stalking. My carer ended up hitting me and calling me weird, so ever since then our relationship has been very strained and I feel a lot of shame about my attachment problems but I know I need to be compassionate and kind to myself about it because it all stems from my mum and trauma. 

Fast forward a few years, I kept forming attachments to different mother figures and over time I‚Äôve learned how to manage the intensity of it better although internally I struggle with it just as much as I used to, it just doesn‚Äôt present the same way anymore. 

Okay so that was all just for context, what I need advice on is my current attachment. As I said I live at a residential college, there we have a wellbeing and student support person, her names Anna, the moment I saw her I knew I‚Äôd get attached so I avoided her for weeks during my first year at the college last year, didn‚Äôt last long because I ended up having to see her for drinking too much and passing out at a club, I was given a drinking band for a week üòÖ 
After that I emailed her many times and one of them was asking if she could be a parental figure type of person for me as I don‚Äôt have parents and she said yes but I don‚Äôt think she knew what she was getting herself into with me and my BPD and stuff lol rip 

After that she gave me her number, a lot of the residents have her number, and then I started messaging her all the time and asking to come see her in her office all the time, I‚Äôd send her drunk text messages, I‚Äôd basically explode over text messages to her about my feelings and my thoughts and my trauma and everything really, she‚Äôd always respond in a caring manner. Last year I told her to go away and then come back so many times, it was very back and forth but she never took it personally because I think she understands why I behave the way I do sometimes, I had to make a statement to the police last year and she drove me there in her car. 

Now it‚Äôs 2024 and it‚Äôs my second year living at the college and knowing Anna. I can open up to her more about things and talk more to her in person rather than messages all the time now, I do send goodnight and goodmorning texts though most days. I haven‚Äôt seen her or been in contact with her for almost a week now because she‚Äôs been so busy with running the college and everything and I guess I feel like I‚Äôve been going crazy, my BPD favourite person symptoms really be going hard, the amount of messages I‚Äôve sent about random ass shit argh. I just, she‚Äôs the first adult in my entire life who I have a stable relationship with, she doesn‚Äôt judge me or hate me or think I‚Äôm weird, all she wants is to support me and help me grow, I‚Äôve never had someone like that in my life before and I just, I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt want to lose her because she very much does feel like a mother figure to me, I feel like I‚Äôve learnt so much from her over this past year already. 

I just don‚Äôt know where this relationship is going, I don‚Äôt know if she actually cares about me or if she‚Äôs just doing her job and I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt know what I want or my expectations, I know she can‚Äôt be my mum, she already has a family of her own but she did say when i leave she‚Äôs more than happy to catch up over coffee together 

I just feel like when im with her I‚Äôm a child again and I act like one too it‚Äôs embarrassing but also she‚Äôs giving me a safe space to express myself and grow as an individual I guess 

I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm asking for I just want someone‚Äôs opinion on the situation and advice or something idk I‚Äôm sorry

Why can‚Äôt i just forget about her already?,1715932648,"disclaimer: i discuss suicide in this post. and this is a fucking long one, sorry. props if you make it through the whole way.

we met at college, the beginning of fall semester. i fell in love with her almost instantly and with my whole heart (in my normal and usual way). though i‚Äôm only 22 years old, i‚Äôve never ever felt such a strong attraction and connection with another person before.

the trouble was that she had a boyfriend, they‚Äôd been together for two years.. yet, despite this fact, she kept flirting and making advances towards me and we were each other‚Äôs favorite person, fast. it was so confusing for me to get all that affection from her while keeping the idea of her boyfriend in mind.

she explained the situation to me while we were out walking together late one night. she felt like she had needs that her boyfriend couldn‚Äôt meet for her, and the passion that they once had was falling off.. and over months she‚Äôd managed to convince him to agree that she could date other people at the same time. she wanted the other person to be me. of course i said yes, almost instantly and with my whole heart.

i knew that i was getting into hot water, but i couldn‚Äôt help it, couldn‚Äôt stop myself, couldn‚Äôt bear to kill this beautiful and exciting thing between us.. i was not at all fond of the idea of ‚Äúsharing‚Äù her with this other guy.. but given what she had told me of her misgivings with the other boyfriend, i thought that if i could build a strong enough connection with her and hold out long enough, that i could win her over through a war of attrition with the other guy.

for three months, her and i had the most intimate relationship that i‚Äôve ever known. she was incredibly open with me, told me everything she knew about herself, and i told her the same. it was so astounding how many ways in which we seemed to be the the same type of weird and fucked up, which drew us really close. we cuddled and slept together all the time, her with her CPAP mask and me with my eyeshades on. during her harrowing period cramps i would sit on the bathroom floor and hold her hand while she laid in the shower with a wet towel draped over her body, curled up under the hot rain. and when i had my intense mood swings she would lie with me and hold me as i was shuttering and sobbing on the floor.. she taught me that it was okay to cry when i was feeling that way, and that i shouldn‚Äôt feel so ashamed of it.

she would buy my food when we went out, never judging me for spending all my money on my passion projects. we traded our most unique and special trinkets with each other, and always kept an eye out for new ones to make or bring home for each other, we were always giving little presents. i even custom designed and made her a beautiful wooden folding table in my wood shop, and she adored it (making furniture for you is my love language lol).

and.. we had lots and lots of sex together. it was so amazing to match with someone whose libido was equal to mine. i‚Äôve never been with someone so attentive and engaged during sex as she was. we were always committed to making the experience as comfortable and pleasing as possible for each other. very early on she told me that she‚Äôd been sexually abused at a young age and that ever since, and still with her other boyfriend, she would have a panic attack or inexplicably cry almost every time after having sex. but with me, she never cried afterwards. and one of my favorite moments with her was when she interrupted me from my homework to tell me how grateful she was that i‚Äôd been so gentle and attentive with her during sex, and that i‚Äôd helped her so to move past the pain and shame that she‚Äôd dealt with following her abuse. it was so sweet <3

but despite all the beautiful and happy parts of our relationship, all the time i was racked with anxiety and jealousy for her other boyfriend. i couldn‚Äôt stand it when she would text him when we were spending private hours together, it just made me feel so worried and sick to my stomach. hers my warning to anyone else with bpd who finds themselves tempted to go into a polyamorous relationship: any existing fear of abandonment that you harbor will be amplified intensely when your partner has another lover, one whom they could decide to leave you for at any moment.

as things started to go downhill in her relationship with the other boyfriend, i was secretly very happy. my plan was going to be successful, i was going to outlast the other guy and have her all to myself! she even asked me at one point, ‚Äúdo you ever get the feeling that you‚Äôre winning against him? i get that feeling.‚Äù that felt really nice to hear.

in late november it came to pass that i was admitted to a mental hospital, having taken too many amphetamines trying to keep up in classes and having admitted maybe a bit too much information to my psychiatrist about the suicidal thoughts i‚Äôd been having lately. she reassured me that it was okay for me to go there, that she wouldn‚Äôt think anything less of me for it and again, i shouldn‚Äôt be ashamed. she stayed with me in the holding wing all the way until the (pointless) ambulance ride to the mental hospital. and during what ended up being two weeks inside, she came to visit me every single day she could. she got me through a very tough time in there..

she came to get me on the day i was released from the hospital. i was so damn happy to be out of there, and was even feeling very hopeful for my future and improving my mental health. and of course i was overjoyed to be back with her. only a day later, she came to me distraught with tears in her eyes. she told me that the other boyfriend had broken up with her. in that moment my emotions were 50/50, one part sympathetic to her pain and one part ecstatic for our freedom. and then she told me something that fucked my head, ‚Äúi wish i‚Äôd ended it with you first.‚Äù it was such a punch in the stomach that i just withered, couldn‚Äôt respond. i walked out of her room and went back to mine to smoke a cigarette out the window. she came in not ten minutes later to apologize, to reassure me that things would be okay with us.

the day after that, one day before winter break, she told me that it was over between us. it‚Äôs lucky that i was on enough stimulants to keep my emotions away from me, otherwise i think my heart would have stopped right then and there. it was simply unreal. she told me that she would miss me dearly. she asked me to lay down in bed with her and spoon her until she fell asleep, and of course i did. i left quietly and paused for a long minute to take one last look at her, asleep in her bed.

i did my best to keep it together in the days following our goodbye. the stimulants were good for my emotional pain but left me sleepless. i was going without food, uncomfortably wired and exhausted, but at least i wasn‚Äôt tying nooses or cutting open my arms. the sequence of events played out over and over again in my mind. at this time i was attending a partial program at the same hospital i‚Äôd just gotten out of, and was able to keep it up for a couple more days.

unfortunately, as if i hadn‚Äôt learned from my previous mistake, i again admitted too much information to the doctors there and wound up getting another involuntary admission. i‚Äôd been out for all of three days. i felt so defeated to be back there, to face all the same patients and nurses i knew. on top of it all, i no longer had any visits from her to look forward to. she texted me only once, a few days into my stay, asked me how i was doing. i told her the truth, that i wasn‚Äôt doing well at all, that i was back inside, that all of my suicidal thoughts were back stronger than before. she told me that she didn‚Äôt want to hear any more, and that she wasn‚Äôt going to contact me again for a while. this was the abandonment i was fearing for three months.

i got frantic. i went to my room and cried and shuttered, thought of how she used to hug me when i was in this way, thought of how she would never do it again. and i knew that this was the very aspect of myself that had pushed her away in the first place. i took my glasses off, laid them on the floor, shattered one of the lenses under a chair leg. i picked up a shard of glass and pressed it into my forearm and started slashing and sobbing. i didn‚Äôt want attention from the staff and i didn‚Äôt want to hurt myself. i wanted to die, to let the poison blood out of my brain and cease the awful feelings it was giving me. i really just wanted to feel peaceful once again.

obviously it didn‚Äôt work, and the shame is still with me. i regret doing something so impulsive and poorly thought out, i don‚Äôt know how i expected that to work. if only my lenses were made of real glass instead of plastic, maybe then i could have gone deep enough. 5 minutes never passed without my mind rethinking the pain of what she‚Äôd said to me or thinking of what i could have said differently or hoping that we would get back together again or despairing at the thought of never speaking to her again. these were the longest and most uncomfortable days of my short life. my stay came to last for 4 weeks, during which i was diagnosed with bpd.

i was out of the hospital again, had spent my whole winter break inside. i was lucky to be let back to school after what had happened, but i was 7/8 semesters through my degree and i just wanted to get through it. i wasn‚Äôt sure whether or not i was looking forward to seeing her again, but i wasn‚Äôt prepared for how it happened. i got a knock on my door and there she was, holding a paper bag of things. she came in and placed the bag on the floor, some clothes of mine she‚Äôd found in her room and a box of earrings that i‚Äôd given her as a Christmas present. i asked her to keep the earrings, i‚Äôd gotten them for her and i had no use for them. she told me she didn‚Äôt want them and i should return them to the seller. that really hurt to hear.

she asked me to delete all the photos of her that were on my phone and stood and watched as i did it. i asked if she wanted a hug, and she refused. i asked if we could talk for a bit, and she refused. then she asked for me to give her blue knitted sweater back, and i dug it out of my laundry basket and offered to wash it for her before giving it back. she said it didn‚Äôt matter because she was going to throw it in the trash anyway. then she just left. i just sat there for a minute, waiting for something, i don‚Äôt know what. then it all slammed down on me, even worse than the last time.

i had a razor blade this time, a brand new one, and i tried really hard to cut deeper now, i really wanted to bleed enough this time. apparently this is a very poor suicide method because despite my best efforts over 10 minutes, the blood just wouldn‚Äôt come out fast enough. by then the pain and concentration from the cutting had completely calmed me down, as much as this disappointed me. i‚Äôm not sure if anyone else gets this but i always feel really angry at myself when i start to calm down from a bad episode, as it feels like the fact it lasted so briefly means that i was faking the whole thing.

i called up my only good friend at school and admitted i‚Äôd done something really stupid. he was pretty freaked out when he saw the mess i‚Äôd made and was adamant on bringing me to the hospital. i told him i couldn‚Äôt go, that it would cost me my enrollment at college if they found out about it, and going to the hospital would make sure of that.. but he wouldn‚Äôt have it and we went. the hospital wouldn‚Äôt but my stupid ‚Äúwood carving accident‚Äù story and they called the police. then another 1 week stay at a different mental hospital. (hospitals really do nothing for me, if you couldn‚Äôt tell). school kicked me out, made me move home. 

i‚Äôve spent the last 5 months at home living with my dad, my brother, and his girlfriend. it‚Äôs been pretty rough, especially considering that i haven‚Äôt been working at all and should have no excuse to feel so shitty all the time. and even 5 months later i just cannot stop thinking about her, every day. she‚Äôs in my thoughts and in my dreams. i catch myself making up conversations with her in my head. every time i see a mazda cx-5 it just punches me in the stomach (that was her car). thinking about her instantly converts an okay time into another seizure of loneliness and negative thoughts. suicidal thoughts and plans are a daily occurrence.

people tell me that i‚Äôm so young and that i‚Äôll find someone else eventually and forget about everything like everyone else has a million times before. and that‚Äôs probably true, i‚Äôll admit it. but if my past experiences have told me anything it‚Äôs that the same script is bound to play out again and again, and that i‚Äôm the element that causes it to do so. i guess i‚Äôm just at a loss as to what i‚Äôm meant to do now..

i feel so lost in my life. i couldn‚Äôt care less if i died at any moment. i feel no fear of death, only of pain. i know exactly what I‚Äôm supposed to do, to get a shit job and work and get therapy and work out and ignore the feelings until enough months are passed and i can get back to school and finish the engineering degree and find a real job and move to the city and on and on. but i feel like i don‚Äôt have the resolve to execute all of that though. i guess i just don‚Äôt want anything enough to actually do what i know i‚Äôm supposed to do. i miss her all the time and it feels like that‚Äôs the only thing there‚Äôs space for in my mind, as much as id prefer to just forget her entirely now. as unhealthy as it is, it seems like romantic relationships are the only thing i really care about in my life, and i‚Äôm cursed to always ruin them.

What to do if a L/O with BPD says something concerning during an episode?,1715932065,"Hi, I hope it‚Äôs okay for me to write here? I saw there was a sub specifically for those with loved ones with BPD but the description immediately threw me off (group for those who have suffered ‚Äòchallenges‚Äô and ‚Äòabuse‚Äô at the ‚Äòhands of those with bpd‚Äô)‚Ä¶ it sounded kind of like there was no room for growth or like people with BPD aren‚Äôt just humans who deserve as much love and patience as anyone else?

Anyways ‚Äî I understand where my boyfriend is coming from when he talks to me about BPD symptoms partially because I have ADHD and experience heavy limerence. I was his FP and he was my limerent object, so we‚Äôre kind of hooked in that way, but have mutually agreed to NEVER step on each others toes or cut the other off from external relationships. 

I understand the jealousy. Seriously, I do. I get the feeling of rationally knowing a mutual friend poses no threat to your relationship but still feeling antsy and bitter and hating yourself for it. He‚Äôs felt sort of apprehensive about someone in our life (old friend of his, new one of mine). It‚Äôs ironic because I literally used to be jealous of this person too and I forced myself to befriend them and now we‚Äôre great pals.. üò≠

He‚Äôd gotten pretty emotional while I was trying to talk to him about this.. I don‚Äôt want them to be friends if that‚Äôs not what he wants ‚Äî but it kind of just makes me have this pit in my stomach being the reason they aren‚Äôt friends anymore. He experiences his feelings regarding BPD super strongly, but always says he knows some of his thoughts are unhealthy and that he never wants to restrain or keep me all to himself. He shows a great amount of self-awareness and maturity and a will to grow, so I really seriously want to make an honest effort to help him. But during this heated conversation he said something super possessive and honestly a little concerning that made me scared. It felt super impulsive ‚Äî I told him I wasn‚Äôt mad and understood how he was feeling, but that his comment made me anxious and that I wanted to talk in the morning when we were both a little more composed. He said that he was sorry and that he didn‚Äôt mean it ‚Äî and that was the end of our conversation.


I guess I‚Äôm just kind of antsy about it. In literally every other conversation we‚Äôve had he‚Äôs not once shown any sort of unhealthy possessiveness over me. It definitely felt like a charged and unrealistic statement ‚Äî not a real threat or something I worry about. It was just kind of harsh and slightly triggering and I wonder how I should discuss it with him. I‚Äôve never been offput by anything he‚Äôs ever said before. 

I don‚Äôt want this to be a ‚Äòstrike‚Äô against him or anything though. We‚Äôre both hurting and I‚Äôm DEFINITELY am not his therapist nor do I ever want to take that role but I refuse to give up on someone I love wholeheartedly just because he‚Äôs struggling mentally. He‚Äôs been showing me nothing but patience and love and respect for my boundaries regarding my own mental issues and I want to show him that same love. That doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt advocate for myself or be blunt with him if I need to be.. I just really want to help support him as much as I can.",mittyguts,,FALSE,1ctznx0,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1ctznx0/what_to_do_if_a_lo_with_bpd_says_something/
How to be there for my cousin,1715931932,"Me and my cousin live in different countries but this summer shes coming here for about 3 weeks. She was diagnosed with BPD (i believe she has quiet BPD) about 2 years ago. We used to fight alot when we were kids but she is my best friend and we never disagree on anything anymore. I know she is severly depressed, very low energy at times, but whenever we hang out she is super sweet and never talks about how she is feeling. We did however have a deep talk last time i saw her about how her life feels with bpd.

Anyways, as i said shes coming here for 3 weeks and we will be home alone. I really want to make this a great time for her, now that she can just get away from all the stuff in her hometown that contribute to her depression. But if she gets low, which she probably will, how can i be there for her? Is there anything specific i should think about to make life as easy and fun as possible while she is here? If she opens up about her feelings, what can i say to make her feel validated? What is it that people with bpd want to hear from others? 

Im sure we are going to have a great time but i really want to make it as special as possible for her.

I so badly want to give up this time!!,1715931667,"I am a 25 year old female, who got diagnosed with bpd at the age of 20 may be, but looking back I think I have always shown the symptoms way early in my life. I am from a very traditional country where the topic of mental health has only started gaining importance. My parents, with their best has always tried to accommodate me, though they have given me enough trauma. I was a very active, hardworking child since childhood but that gave me a lot of bullying right from school.

I have been having recurring episodes and been in therapy and medicine. For the last one year, my medications were stable and strong however I have always felt the void and have always wanted to stop feeling the pain.I have had nights blaming myself. Even if I am not at fault, even if I point someone‚Äôs mistake, it‚Äôs me who I accuse at the end of day.I am afraid of being with a man yet again, since my previous relationship made me end up in the hospital since I tried cutting myself. My parents at that time asked me to at least be alive till my sister gets married off so she gets to have a respectful happy life, now that I have ruined the rest of their lives. I know this was told to me while my mother was having an angry rush and I do not want to speak ill of the woman who took care of me for so long. Looking at the life of normal individuals and society in general , I feel ashamed of the emotional baggage I am carrying. I excel at my works but my¬† mental conflict and my pain are way too much for me to handle. I am not able to hold up anymore is what I feel right now. My sister‚Äôs wedding is in a month and I have requested my family to not get me expensive clothes or any gifts since I am unwilling to live after that.

When were good its good and when it goes bad it seems to snowball out of control. 
I listen to her alot and try and do the things she needs, but it always feels like it never works, or theres always something more i should do, and ill be honest it drains me so bad and i really reflect of her moods, and she even goes as far to say i have different personalities myself.

What do I do????,1715931375,"So I've been lurking on Reddit for a long time now but something compelled me to make a post since I've been in a terrible place lately.

I've (25F) had BPD, OCD and bipolar disorder for a long time and it's absolutely awful.

I've been in university for around five years now but it's so hard to finish even though all my batchmates have left because I always end up with some sort of meltdown and can't function. My family doesn't understand, my father always pressures me to graduate asap because we don't have much funding left for tuition fees and it's hard to find a job without a degree here but it's So. Hard.

So what I've been doing instead is. Well. Drugs and alcohol lol.

This year has been awful so far. I haven't been able to stop thinking about my trauma. I feel useless because I'm too disabled to work or leave the house often. My mind has felt like a complete mess and nothing is helping. I started wanting to kill myself again. I set a date and kept writing about all of the reasons I want to die. I've held pills in my hand, staring at them, despite knowing that taking them would likely just make me feel miserable instead of killing me, but I feel like I deserve to suffer. I almost did take them once until it felt like some part of me made me put them back and I just comforted myself for a bit. I've been looking up what household items I could kill myself with. I've been looking up how it feels to get hit by a car and the specific effects of an overdose of certain meds. So many nights I have laid awake crying or dissociating because of how miserable and lonely I feel. I've stopped talking to all of my friends, my closest ones with good reason since they barely even acknowledge my existence; the only people I talk to now are my family and my therapist. I've been wanting to cut myself again or do anything that gives me even just a moment of peace.

Some advice I‚Äôd like to share,1715920656,"TW: SH, addiction, pr0n etc. (addiction related)

Whether it‚Äôs self-harming, p0rn addiction (because some of us are hypersexual, and that is okay) or alcohol/ drug abuse etc. When attempting to push away from that and find healthier habits, consistency is your best friend.

If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôve probably thought ‚ÄúI am bad. In the end this is who I am, so what‚Äôs the point of trying to improve‚Äù. And this is valid, this is a valid feeling. And I don‚Äôt want to do the generic mental health advice ‚Äúyour feelings are valid or your behaviour is not‚Äù - like??? It is very true but can feel invalidating. 

When you feel those horrible feelings and want to turn to your coping mechanisms, that‚Äôs when you find real healing. Because if you get through that, when you think life is over and all hell has broken loose, you‚Äôll find that it gets easier next time to break habits. Not even ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù - Personally I hate addiction recovery terms because they make it seem like it‚Äôs not you and it‚Äôs an alien concept that you have to conform to.

You are still you, at least give yourself the chance of critiquing that negative voice that ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt change‚Äù by using actions rather than calculating and ruminating with your thoughts.

I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed but myself and my psych have a suspicion that something bigger than depression and anxiety is going on‚Ä¶

- I have lots of moods throughout the day and they change very very fast
- I‚Äôll be depressed for a few days then be super energetic, talkative, motivated, irritated for a few days and then back to being depressed. Sometimes in the same day
- I don‚Äôt experience manic symptoms like being happy etc I‚Äôm actually anhodenic
- my anhodenia only clears up if I‚Äôm doing impulsive behaviors or risk taking (adrenaline rush)
- I crave risks
- I have an obsession with spending money (mostly from boredom) but it also makes me feel good
- this is the big one‚Ä¶ I get new hobbies every week and I obsess over them. The newest one being I decided to throw out every item in my home that contained chemicals and began the ‚Äúnon toxic lifestyle‚Äù. Researched for hours, donated everything, researched things, bought them, made new items, etc. still kicking on this one but I think it may stick around. But I go through different things weekly honestly. (Could very well be my ocd and obsessive personality) 

- I get on something and can‚Äôt stop raving about it 
- other peoples issues become my own when they shouldn‚Äôt and it puts me into moods
- I have strong opinions and get defensive about others issues and put myself into their business behind the scenes so to speak

Also, I go from loving someone to hating them for no reason. However, there‚Äôs 3 people that‚Äôs never happened with and that‚Äôs my fiance, my baby, and my grandma.

Is this Splitting?,1715893052,"For context, today I saw on FB a girl laugh react and comment on my FPs latest post, to which he laugh reacted and commented back with a laughing emoji in his response. Would've been fine but I've seen this girl hearting/commenting/interacting with his posts for a couple months now and I finally had to ask him about who she was/express that I had an icky feeling about it. Turns out my Spidey senses are real because she was a former potential love interest of his that he drove an hour to meet and get a hotel room with after months of talking!

I tell him I'm uncomfortable with him still being friendly-ish with her like this with a ""former romantic interest/person"" and he said that he lost interest a long time ago and it was never romantic. I immediately started profusely apologizing to him because I knew I didn't want to freak out on him for the emotions I was feeling but internally I was screaming I knew I was right. 

My thinking spiraled down into the mindset that other girl is prettier/funnier/smarter and a better partner for him and that me starting this conversation was going to be the end of me and my FPs relationship(yes he's my boyfriend)and that if I wasn't so fucking stupid and insecure none of this would be happening. I cried on and off for hours silently at work and then when I got in my car I had a full on mental breakdown of me sobbing bawling my eyes out screaming and whatnot. He hadn't been replying after I had apologized about over 7 texts and called myself stupid twice via those texts so that's why it got so bad. But I didn't let him know how horrible of a state I was in. I don't want him to know how bad I actually get.

He ended up replying and saying he wasn't upset with me, that he loved me and that I didn't need to be sorry.

Should i apologize for a greater good?,1715892239,"Context: i (24M) am now engaged and living  together with my girlfriend (21F), she came to live with me a month ago, we had an agreement  that we'd be together no matter what, i didnt care who went where, but she agreed that here is the best place to do so. She lived on the other side of the country, i have visited her hometown, its nothing like here.
I had a best friend, we argued and had a huge fight around two or three months ago. To summarize, he's the kind of friend that, when bothered or mad, goes on a rampage saying everything we're doing wrong to him, how we can be better and etc, he's a fake high person. Over 12 years of friendship, and since he's always been my only friend, i took it every time, defending myself, but not in a fiercely way. Anyways, last time we had an argument, he said a bunch of awful things, the reason of the fight was something he misunderstood, but i got mad and i did what he always did, said a lot of stuff, afterwards he said ""after all the bad things you said about me, the way you see me, I don't think we can be friends anymore"". I could've explained the misunderstanding, I could've saved my friendship, but i chose not to. I find him an arrogant hypocrite for saying that, after he's done the same to me like 30 times and i did it once (the worse i said to him is that he was basically being a teen girl throwing a tantrum, i didn't even said anything that bad).
Anyways, his wife came from far away, the same place my girl came,  and she suffered a lot when she came here, she missed her home, and it took over a year for it to get really better, the plan was to try to get them to be friends, so my girl would have someone to talk to about her hometown, someone that actually understands her, because now, my girlfriend is suffering from it, and it breaks my heart not being able to help at all
I'm considering apologizing, even when i did nothing at all to him, to get the friendship back, so i can do what we originally planned and try to get my girl to smile more again.
The former friend has always gaslighted me, manipulated me and etc, because he knew i only had him as a friend and that i was scared to lose him and being alone, now i see it all, after i had guts to finally end it.

Discharged from Psych ward - haven't been prescribed medication and still feel like I'm gonna hurt myself. Not sure where to go from here.,1715884614,"Short answer is they were trying to push me out of the ward as fast as they could. I stayed for 1 week.

When I was there I just caused trouble to be honest, absconded twice, snuck in shards of glass to self harm with. kept trying to leave and some person touched me from behind without realizing what emotional state I was in so I got physical with them without thinking which isn't like me since I'm quiet BPD (or heavily relate to it at least).

None of the staff understood my issues at all. They all assumed I was just doing everything for attention or some shit. I barely spoke to the Dr's even so its partially my fault since I struggle greatly with face to face communication. So they just kinda fucked me around for a week putting me on a temp hold even though they were discharging me in a couple days, offered me medication (Abilify) but withdrew that decision. Then just essentially told me to socialise in the community more. Then psych talked to me literally on the last day and offered psychology, but good load of use that does me a day before discharge.

I'm obsessed with my toxic ex and his girlfriend.,1715884360,"I'm obsessed with my ex and his girlfriend. In like 5th grade me and her used to good friends, and I always found her interesting. We were good friends and she trusted me. And I was happy to be friends with her. 
But now my ex is dating her for over 1.5 years. And we broke up 1.5 years ago. And it didn't even take him days to go after her. I wanted to be friends with her but I couldn't, and they both were friends with each other.

But at that time, I had him. He was my boyfriend. And we were eachothers first proper relationship. We went out for about 6 months and I broke up with him around the 8 th  month. I'm saying that because, we had a on and off relationship. And I was in a very toxic place with him. He used to send me hate  messages, and he would state the things that he hates about me and even abuse him. But I still wanted him, because well I unconditionally loved him ( I know I was an idiot) 

My ex had a dark past, he was raped by his neighbour repaditly when he was a kid to when he was 17 years old. He used to cry and I would consule him, he even tried to take his life multiple times but I stopped him everytime. Me and him, we were both depressed as fuck, like we both were on the werge of dying and kill ourselves but then we found eachother. And that's how we became friends to best friends to inseparable couple.

I grew up in a very toxic household. My own mother was abusive, she would hurt me physically and emotionally alot. It was every days seen. She once hit me so hard that I thought I was going to pass out. And the reason she hit me so much for that day was pointless.

I grew up with a absent father who used to hit me whenever he felt like it. He once hit me so bad when I was in like 6th grade that my whole mouth was broken. I was bleeding so much from my mouth and my nose. He didn't ever wanted a daughter, he only wanted a son. But I was the firstborn girl. 

I still remember that when I was like 8 or 9 years old, my dad has just came home and I was watching cartoons. And he asked me for the remote and I said no, I'm watching cartoon. He slapped me so hard that my ear was bleeding all night and I remember being in the doctor's chair and there was alot of clotted blood in my ear. I was crying in pain all the night, he didn't even checked on me and continued to sleep.

 I was bullied alot throughout my school life. I was never really good at studies so I was hit my all my teachers in front of everyone all the time and they just used to laugh at me. In 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th grade. I remember this and this humiliation still haunts me, I got really bad grades and all my classmates who I thought were my friends, took trash out of the dustbin and whatever they had like paper pieces and leaves and ofc trash. They dumped all of it on my and they were pointing and laughing. I wanted to cry my heart out, I wanted to scream so bad, but I instead was thrown out of the group on the school field and nobody wanted to be friends with the dumb girl. 

Anyway I think this can literally go on forever. I'm here to talk about my ex, so I always had doubts that he liked that girl, and I even told him multiple times that, hey, I think she likes you. Maybe you should be with her instead of me. I had very low self-esteem and I thought I wasn't worthy of any sort of love. So I tried to push him away. But he stayed and always told me that he's not even going to talk to her after the school ends. And that I have nothing to worry about really. So I believed him. But guess what he's now been dating her for 1.5 years and she even has the same birthday as me. This thing just ruins my birthday. Because I always end up thinking of them. And that will wish me "" happy birthday"" this year?

 I've become very very obsessive when it comes to them. I literally just spend hours searching for the playlist that they created for eachother. And that's what confirmed that they are together. At first I was in denial that he'd never do such a thing. But when I asked him this recently he said yes. And he even said "" don't even utter a word against her""

Partner doesn't believe I have BPD (he says I don't have emotional ""swings"" but I know I do. They are all internal.)  I am doing the DBT workbook and am noticing certain things. I take everything out on myself, and everything is internal. 

We were supposed to visit family today, and my husband picked up a cold earlier this week. I ended up catching it. Now we can't see our little niece and I just started crying, blaming myself feeling like a horrible person. I had a huge emotional swing, just breaking down loads of dispair. Kept saying ""I ruined it."" I went to the extreme where I blamed myself for getting in the way of my husband connecting with his family, and I felt like he should leave me. I felt like I ruined everything.

My husband called my mother-in-law and she was so sweet, telling me it wasn't my fault. She was so understanding. Spoke to my own father - he told me to go and expose an infant otherwise I would be offending my in-laws. So his comments didn't help.

Emotionally regulating is really hard. Am trying to use my ""wise mind"" to understand that I just caught a virus and wasn't doing anything wrong to take my husband from his family, yet this all still feels like my fault. I still blame myself.

My mother in law kept asking me ""why are you sorry? You're sick! It's okay."" This is just so hard.

Even though I didn't want my medications messed with, she altered my zoloft and is adding a medication for ADHD. 
But also, at the beginning of the appointment she asked what my goal was, I told her that outside of my diagnosed ADHD, depression, and anxiety, I feel like I have other issues going on, and I said I was seeking evaluation and referrals for therapy.

isolating myself is so comforting yet so painful,1715881294,"so right now, i‚Äôm out of work and have been since i lost my job late last year. i have a boyfriend who i love and 2 friends who i see sometimes, im terrible at replying and i feel awful for this but for some reason, being in constant conversation with someone, even over text just drains me. 

it was honestly actually a relief in a way when i lost my job, every single day i would constantly be obsessing over small interactions with coworkers, the smallest thing makes me so angry, if i feel disrespected or not listened to, it invokes a rage into me that i know i absolutely cannot show at work. i am completely unable to be ‚Äòdiplomatic‚Äô, i will let resentment build until i can‚Äôt take it any longer and fly off the handle, using anger as a way to voice how i feel. i feel i literally cannot explain to someone that they‚Äôve upset me, unless im angry. of course, this is very unhealthy and has led to a lot of situations where im the one having to apologise for my reaction, rather than addressing why they upset me in the first place. this behaviour haunts almost every relationship i have. the ones id doesn‚Äôt impact, are the friends which i make sure i don‚Äôt get too close to, in order for this behaviour to not ruin our friendship. 

i am thinking of doing some voluntary work one day a week so im getting out my apartment more, but honestly the thought of being around a group of people, even just 1 day a week, fills me with dread and anxiety. its the same thing every time, i start a job, its the best job ever and everyone and everything is perfect to begin with, then a few months down the line, i become paranoid, i find out someone has said x about me behind my back, now i absolutely hate them, they‚Äôre a horrible person and no one can convince me otherwise. at every job i look back on, and this may sounds really silly, but it actually feels like i‚Äôve been through some kind of social trauma due to the way i obsess, hyperfixate and catastrophize every slight miscommunication, every comment, every look. i sit in my room for hours thinking and obsessing, sometimes sending me into panic attacks about the way people are treating/perceiving me. i start getting suicidal thoughts, feel as though everything is f*cked, i am f*cked, my whole life is f*cked forever. it is honestly draining. i actually amaze myself at how much i drain my own energy literally just by *thinking*. 

i‚Äôm in a trauma based therapy right now for sexual abuse i went through during my teens by my step father. i hope it helps because honestly i don‚Äôt know how much longer i can take living like this. isolation is comfortable, yet so lonely. i tell myself i would like to be alone, yet every time i am left alone in my apartment for a few days, i turn to drink, drugs and self harming because i feel so lonely. i thought i loved being on my own, so why do i always feel like this when im on my own? i feel like every single emotion and feeling i feel, conflicts another. if im around people, i can‚Äôt handle it. if im on my own, i also can‚Äôt handle it. 

i dont want to be this way. i want to do things with my life, i wanted a career and i want healthy relationships yet, it all seems so out of reach. every social interaction feels like the mental equivalent of someone poking at an infected wound, whether it‚Äôs a genuine interaction or not. my brain will always tells me its negative, that people are out to get me, that people are conspiring against me, using me, that they hate me, they are repulsed and disgusted by me and i feel such deep, deep shame about myself. 

sometimes, i look back on the times before the trauma during my teens happened. and i am so envious of the little girl i was, who trusted so willingly, who loved so freely, so openly, without fear of consequence. the girl who wasn‚Äôt constantly ashamed, angry, frightened and paranoid. i wish i could go back and tell her how lucky she is. 

sorry for the rant. i am so tired of feeling this way and if anyone else feels the same, i hope soon enough we can find a way to work through these dreadful feelings and soon become people that will make that little girl/boy inside of us proud. and thank you for taking the time to read my rant :)

Am I overreacting?,1715881185,"So my partner and I recently broke up and I am unsure if I am just being over the top or logical,  so any advice would help.
So to preface the issue,  we are long distance but have known eachother for going on 13 years. 
We got super serious during covid and spent literally everyday together,  then as things lifted and she was able to see her friends,  she started partying with them again and having nights out,  not an issue for me. 
1 of the nights her friends were hanging out,  she calls me making weird noises and we got disconnected,  so I attempted multiple times to call back with no answer. 
After her friends leave she calls me and we start hanging out(mind it's almost 4am at this point),  and she proceeds to tell me her friend Emma couldn't make it,  which means she was getting hammered with her ""gay"" friend Andrew alone in her apartment.  She told me Emma and Andrew carpooled and showed up together. 
This situation pissed me off because,  why lie to begin with?
I had never said or implied she couldn't hang out with her male friends,  so this caused us issues that made it difficult to trust her because she lied with no reasoning. 
She promised not to lie again about who she was with and to communicate better.

Fast forward to today

Saturday night we were gonna chill after she got off work,  she texts me and says ""I'm gonna go out and enjoy the sun,  not sure if we will get to hang out"".
My first thought was ""cool I don't mind if we miss a day of hanging out"",  but I couldn't quite figure out what was with the vaguarity of the message.  I thought ""ok the sun is only out for 3 hours tops at this hour"",  but I just kind of shrugged it off. 
She only responded to 1 message out of 5 and most of them were pertaining to our plans for the following day,  then at around 3am,  she finally starts texting me back but completely disregards all previous messages. 
We ended up getting into a fight because of her lack of communication and being out all night,  the next day she acted like nothing happened and wanted to hang out,  to which I refused and ended up telling her impulsively that I didn't want to be together. 
After 2 days of fighting about the situation she finally admitted she went out drinking with her ""gay"" coworker who she just met (out of character for her).
I kind of feel like claiming a guy is ""gay"" is an easy out though,  and a last minute outing with a man that you hide from your partner of 4 years seems off. 
She claims she didn't say anything cause she knew I wouldn't be ok with it,  which seems worse to me that she still did it.

My life looks a lot different now. Now I have a job and a partner that I‚Äôve been with for years. I‚Äôm clean from drugs and self harm and my BPD symptoms aren‚Äôt very prevalent anymore most times. I haven‚Äôt been able to kick the ED though and I will acknowledge that it‚Äôs probably adding to my misery a lot.

For years, pretty much since I got clean, I‚Äôve been missing how things used to be so much. I am so bored of life. I‚Äôm bored of waking up every day just to go do a job that I hate, come home, eat dinner, go to bed, and do it all again the next day. It‚Äôs depressing. At least when I was on drugs I could get high and feel better whenever I wanted. I would give anything to feel like I did when I was 17 again. I had coping strategies that actually worked, even if they were hurting me physically, they made me feel better emotionally. I don‚Äôt get to feel good emotionally now. 

I also really miss the people who were in my life at the time. I met my first FP about 6 months before I got diagnosed with BPD, and of course, I thought I was in love with him. To make it even better for my attention starved teenage self, he was an older guy who also struggled with sh, suicidal ideation, and drug addiction. 

Our disorders fed off each other and even though it wasn‚Äôt healthy for either of us he was my best friend in the world for a few years, it felt like whatever I went through he‚Äôd always be there and I was there for him. He even knew how hopelessly in love with him I was, and he didn‚Äôt mind. He made it clear to me nothing would ever happen because I was a minor and he was an adult, and nothing weird or sexual ever did happen, but even knowing that a fucked up teenage girl like me had a huge crush on him, he was still there for me, he was still my best friend, and he never made me feel bad or embarrassed about any of it.

We don‚Äôt talk anymore, and I know I didn‚Äôt actually love him it was just infatuation, but he was honestly the best friend I ever had and I think I‚Äôll miss him forever. A part of me even wonders if I want to get back into my old habits just to feel close to him again.",EnterpriseSpaghetti,,FALSE,1cthd5r,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cthd5r/i_miss_how_chaotic_my_life_used_to_be/

How to best get over first heartbreak?,1715875315,"18M I screwed up so bad and all throughout the relationship I let my emotions get in the way and she delt with it , because she loved me. She told me I had to change and that she wouldn‚Äôt give me another chance if I screwed up again. Well I screwed up again. I had a whole thing at prom with her because she was spending too much time with her friend (who lives 2 hours away and payed 80 bucks to get there) I felt it should have been our night and I was jealous of her spending so much time with her best friend ( she‚Äôs a girl btw). I got angry and yelled at her about it infront of her friend without really thinking. I embarrassed her and I hated myself for it and how I had ruined both our nights on such a special event. I got really low and had an emotional breakdown in the bathroom and I hurt myself. I punched myself a lot and she texted me that she was leaving and that I always do this to her when we‚Äôre together with other people trying to have a good time and how I ruined this for her , and she said my negativity was gonna be the end of our relationship. Well a lot of stuff happened and I called her while I was crying and walking in the road and I was so screwed up , she called my mom because she was worried about me. I took an Uber to her house because I wanted to try to fix things and really apologize but I was a mess. She comforted me while I cried on her shoulder until my mom came. She called me drunk at 2 am to break up with me. Basically that convo ended in us deciding to have some space and talk later when she was ready.

I eventually accepted it after bawling like I never have before. She said maybe we can find each other ther in the future when we‚Äôre both better.

Why do people make anger/aggression their personality ?,1715875126,"

My friend often talks about herself as being ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù.

Boyfriend said I am unhappy all of the time and it broke me. Some thoughts I wrote down last night that I want to share.,1715874546,"I remember when I was a kid and I would daydream nearly every night before bed about me as an adult. Who I'd be with, what I'd be driving, and where I would live. I would even imagine the outfits I'd be wearing - button-up blouse with a teddy bear print, knee length skirt (gray) and modest shoes or sandals. 
I remember imagining how cool life would be, all the boyfriends I'd have and the places I'd see.

I wish life as an adult was as easy as my former dreams. I wish I could imagine myself as happy and instantly feel good. I've never known what happiness feels like. I guess that's why I always felt different and out of place as a kid. When I would see them freely express joy and partake in any activity without any second thoughts or doubts. I never understood why they never reacted or felt the same way as me.

Now that I am an adult, life hardly measures up to what I imagined as a kid. I didn't know about heartbreak, frustrations, misunderstandings, and my intense rage.
I didn't know that being in a relationship meant I would be forced to face hardships.
I didn't know myself then, and I feel like I don't know myself now.
What I do now is
I can be crazy,
I get hurt a lot,
I have fears of rejection, 
I am insecure,
I can't control my anger and often get worked up over the littlest things.
I get offended a lot,
I care too much about what other people think of me even though I am not entirely sure who it is that is me.

I have my causes. I know what's worth fighting for. But that can't be all there is to my identity.

I want to feel happy.
I want to show love.
I want to comfortably orgasm like I don't give a fuck.
I want to know that it is okay to be me in the face of disagreements.
I want to freak out if my boyfriend would just let me.

The only time I ever feel like I am truly expressing myself is when I feel intense emotions

NPD vs BPD,1715874501,"I'll keep it brief, as this sub is a little stricter on buzzwords. But a lot of the behaviours in my opinion overlap. Because of the nature of having an unstable personality, I (diagnosed BPD) mostly used to show the insecure, begging version of myself. On the other hand, there were instances where I could not feel empathy, and masked insecurity in the same way as NPD, instead of seeking validation and worth from people.

I struggle with dating apps, very few matches, very few of which become conversations, even fewer become dates. So to fill the void of physical contact and feeling wanted I turned to casual sex.

Swingers club have been great - having a night out partying with fun people in your underwear and hopefully having some fantastic sex with one or more of them? Ideal, at least if I'm in the mood for lots of people.

But once I branch out into private meets, it typically goes one of two ways - there's no connection, we just have sex (usually fun sex) and move on without seeing each other again, but I feel a bit empty. Or we do have some kind of connection, have a great time and meet up again, which means I get attached, develop feelings, and then get rejected because they're not looking for a relationship - or just don't want one with me.

Cue devastation, downward spiral, general misery.

However, I'm starting to doubt the accuracy of the diagnosis for a significant reason.

  So i, (22NB), have been seeing this therapist for over a year. aside from this aspect hes been a great match for me. one issue i have with therapists is when they get their degree 40 years ago and refuse to open up their minds. yes, they can be competent too, but its so much better when the professional admits they can be wrong. 
the only thing he is bad with is my bpd. 
  right off the bat i told him first session what i suspect i have, with a list of the BPD criteria and times in my life i‚Äôve fit that. any thing else i have hes good with. but that even after i named those symptoms he goes, ‚Äúyeahh alot of bpd symptoms‚Äù in a condescending way. after a while ive made a 14+ page masterdoc of the BPD criteria and my own personal experiences with all of it. i didnt finish entirely but it didnt matter. he just stopped me and condescendingly went ‚Äúyes you have alot of bpd symptoms but idk how this is helpful to us‚Äù  I SPENT THE WHOLE 3 ish DAYS PRIOR MAKING THAT.

       i took her to my session bc i was sick of being emotionally abused my whole life. i wanted someone else to see what she does to me and surprise surprise, she gaslit both of us and played the role of the sweet, hardworking stressed-out mother who just wanted to help her poor little child with autismü•∫give me a fucking break. i was run so ragged and we argued in the session. i went through aba and speech ‚Äútherapy‚Äù as a kid and it ruined me. she refuses to acknowledge my hurt around it and wont believe i was abused. i asked him to confirm to her it was abuse but bro said nothing the entire session. but what did he do? use it as a gotcha to say i didnt have bpd. its just LeaRnEd BeHaViorS from my mom (she has no borderline symptoms) do i take my anger out on others bc thats what she does to me ? yes. do i get angry in unhealfhy ways impulsively in ways that my mother has nothing to do with? also yes. the whole call i was extremely upset not even in a bp way, but in an abused child that is being gaslit and betrayed by their therapist who now thinks my mom isnt ‚Äúthat bad‚Äù way. he broke up with me over text message with no response and no references. he talked with my psychiatrist so now he doesnt think i have bpd either. im currently out of therapy and have a psychiatrist who doesnt believe me. ive done 7 years of research and icknow what im talking about. im so sick of people denying the fact im hurting and im so sick of not being treated.  i also never know if i open up enough in therapy.  its subconscious at this point but i thought i was doing good for a while.  idk. i need therapy so bad but i have so much trauma regarding it. ive never once had a good therapist and im really losing hope here. sometimes i wonder my parents refusing to get me treatment for 10+ years till i was 20 was deserved.  its not like i am therapy-ing right anyway. the one place everybody has a right to have as their safe place never has and never will be safe for me. i feel like i‚Äôm losing my mind.

When I found this out, I tried to call my one friend, but she ignored my phone call because she was too busy smoking, knowing that I needed the support because I was alone, and one of my conditions were for my friends to please not smoke in front of me. So she didn‚Äôt pick up and chose to smoke over being of company to me. Then, I had asked my very best friend if she would be around for company and support after my friend‚Äôs memorial. She said no, it‚Äôs too much for her. I will admit that I started splitting on both of them after those two occasions, because my friend has just died and no one wanted to be around. But at some point I pulled back. 

They haven‚Äôt spoken to me for two weeks, and don‚Äôt plan to. My best friend said ‚Äúshe just wants her old friend back‚Äù. Which makes me feel hurt because I‚Äôm still here. I am her friend. The same friend I‚Äôve been for years. I‚Äôm just not the perfect version of myself that she wants me to be. I can‚Äôt have people in my life conditionally based on my circumstances. I would do anything for my friends. Especially if they were at their lowest points. I am in such a bad state that my mom is on watch for me in case she has to take me to the hospital to be under observation if I am a danger to myself. And my friends? No where to be seen. Not only have I lost my friend who took his life, but now I‚Äôve lost two of my best friends after the fact as well. I just feel completely helpless. I‚Äôve had to delete social media because they‚Äôre posting petty things to their stories. I‚Äôm finding it hard to accept that these friendships may have run their course. But I just think it‚Äôs such a nasty thing to do, especially considering my one friend is a psychology major. And is turning 35.

Maybe I am a lunatic,1715815649,"I've always lied to everyone and myself. I've always been good at it. I hide things and I know how to make people perceive me a certain way. I can read people well enough to know the worst in them, but blind enough to avoid seeing the good. I sometimes feel like I have a thread around my neck that is holding my head in place, only staying there because I have my hands to rest on.

I've always wanted to make sense, but maybe I just dont, maybe my brain is too broken to do so, or can you really call something broken if it never really had a shape to begin with? I survived, and that's all I know. I will do whatever I can to survive, even if it means murder or to hurt others, because that's what I am. I am seen as sympathetic because I want to, and because it is easier. Is that true? or am I deceiving myself to think of myself as a threat? maybe I am really as vulnerable as they say. I always wanted people to pity me as a kid, because it made it easier to feel safe and protected. Do I feel remorse because I want to? am I sane because I want to?

I sometimes want to push myself off of a bridge, maybe not to care about how crazy I seem to actually be. I reject how fucked up of a person I am, and the disgusting things I am willing to do to satisfy myself. I am a monster, and maybe I've always hid this from myself.

I dont think I've ever really had a good sense of morals, or who knows. I act according to ethics, but is that only for appearances? I follow morals because that's the best course of action, so is it only a cold calculation? What kind of monster am I? one who is aware? or one who is not? How can I change personality traits so easily? I feel like water, or a fire that can't turn itself off, but can spread as much as it wants.

I don't know who I am, and I don't know how I feel. But, I've started to wonder if that is by my own design. I am a lunatic that appears to be sane, only because I want others to see me that way, and more importanty, because I want to see myself as sane. I am not a force of good or evil, at least that's what I am thinking right now. I am just a force that will pull wherever it thinks it is best to go. I am insane.

At least that's the narrative I have at the moment. Maybe it will simply change in an hour, or in a day. No one seems to be able to predict me, and neither can I.

"Weird question but, do you guys feel like every emotion is like a separate personality?   (NOT A DIAGNOSIS QUESTION)",1715805927,"To first clear things up, i do not have a professional diagnosis regarding BPD, nor do i want reddit to diagnose me with BPD. If that helps, i‚Äòm currently being assessed for Autism and if my Autism assessment isn‚Äòt resulting in an Autism diagnosis i will most likely be screened for personality disorders. Just needed to clarify, that i‚Äòm relying on professionals for diagnosis.
Let‚Äòs get to the relevant part though, without any labels. Also known as experiences.
It‚Äòs just kind of odd, i notice how when i‚Äòm irritated i have this huge hatred for all of humanity and start assuming nobody is really trustable and that i shouldn‚Äòt emotionally confide in anyone and how for instance intimacy is just pure egoistic cooperation for the mutual self satisfaction of needs. The typical misanthropic kind of stuff.Being the cynical type of guy. If the emotion is something different (which i genuinely cant tell what emotion it is) i can also have huge urges to be vulnerable, to be held and just loved. I‚Äòll refer to it as the hopeless romantic. Sometimes i feel apathetic as hell and feel like i‚Äòm an outsider and..well let‚Äòs just compare it to the character Meursault from the Stranger from Albert Camus.
I got that whole idc attitude. 
Sometimes i feel like everyone around me hates me (as in, i sense hatred though i have no basis to think so and then i have the sense of inferiority but at the same time i can feel grandiose/superior about the reason i‚Äòm being hated by peers). It‚Äòs simply i refuse to engage in the consumption of recreational substances. 
If the emotions are according i may be super invested in academic activities (because my personality kinda switches into the whole productive trope)

A final point is, i feel like i don‚Äòt really know who i am. As in, i deeply reflect, which gives people the illusion that i am very self aware. But i do that because everyone else around me seems to be so effortless in knowing who they are.

Therapy is draining me dry, but I know I just have to start it and figure out the rest later, and I'm thankful I can be on a sliding scale... But anyway, I know therapy is not accessable to most, or maybe DBT itself feels overwhelming. So I wanted to show this resource because I didn't realize how many free DBT books there are on the Internet archive.

My psych recently recommended me [DBT Made Simple by Sheri Van Dijk ](https://archive.org/details/dbtmadesimpleste0000vand)and that I should read it alongside my treatment to get a feel for everything.

Please still see a therapist though, if you have the means at all. This is NOT a replacement to therapy, just a supplement. You do need someone to help monitor how you're doing and giving tailored, unbiased but thoughtful advice into your life, and it does help to talk to a good professional, even if it sucks getting in the door.

Please tell me I made the right choice having an abortion and that I could never have handled or given my baby everything because of my BPD,1715860520,"I have diagnosed BPD and ADD, my ex has bipolar and ADD (diagnosed as well).

I always without fail took the pill, but my ex never used protection so we just got very very unlucky falling pregnant.

He instantly lost his shit. Fell into depression. Started ignoring me. Telling me he can't have this baby.

I never wanted kids because of my childhood trauma but once I found out I was pregnant I guess hormones kicked in and I loved the baby. I saw it on ultrasounds and it was measuring perfect. For once I took proper care of my body and health. For my baby. All my actions pointed to me wanting to keep it.

However with my ex desperate for an abortion and the moral window closing soon (if I got an abortion I'd want it before 8 weeks - no nervous system on brain activity yet, so it would not feel or be aware of anything) things were getting super tense.

My ex threatened suicide. He said he would leave me and never want to see our child. He already abandoned another child (that he told me his ex kept from him, but during my pregnancy admitted to never wanting), so I knew he was capable of that.

When his bipolar gets bad he's usually off the rails getting into debt and bouts on unemployment, so I knew financially he'd contribute next to nothing. (he pays his ex 100/150 a month)

I asked my family if they would support me (let me live there for the first few months with baby) and they basically said no. Then I thought about it and hated myself for wanting to bring my baby into the lives of the people who traumatised me.

But I had no one else. I struggle with codependency like my mom so I was unhealthily attached to my ex and had no support system whatsoever.

I got a lot of counselling from unwanted/unplanned pregnancy therapists but it always came down to its up to you, if you want it, keep it.

I wanted to keep it so badly but how could I, faced with reality:

- I have BPD. I'm easily overstimulated and completely shut down when I am. Frequently fall into depression and suicidal ideation where I'm unable to function for days. I can barely take care of myself. I don't have life skills, I cannot teach a child how to regulate themselves. I'd resent them depending on me probably.

- I'm codependent and would probably repeat the same dynamics with my child that my mother did with me. Enmeshment. Emotional dependence. Traumatising my child for life even though I'd love it with all my heart.

- my ex has severe mental illness and ADD like me (what is the genetic element in this? Would our baby be more likely to suffer from mental illness/disability as well)

- no support system whatsoever.... Literally no one except my mentally ill parents. I'm not stable either. How am I going to show up for my child in the best way every single day? As much as I told myself I'd die for my child and do it all, that is wishful thinking and unrealistic and unfair.

- despite many moms doing it alone on purpose the thought of my child not having a dad, knowing that they were abandoned, and me not having a partner to support me, it felt wrong. Like every child deserves two loving parents.

- I'd have to get off my meds because they weren't pregnancy safe. I'm on an extremely high dose so without it who knows what would happen to me on different/no meds. 

I had the abortion because in my mind love was simply not enough.

Afterwards my ex cheated, threw me out and made me homeless, I was hospitalized for an od because I just couldn't handle living anymore.

My 'due date' is coming up and I am still so incredibly sad, grieving. People tell me the baby was 'nothing' yet. But it was everything to me. My whole heart. Something more than me. I feel so sorry. Guilty. Curious how it would have been. Wishing I could have been enough.

BPD with no feelings of emptiness?,1715856233,"So recently I got diagnosed with BPD while trying to get help for my suicidal/self harm issues. This came as a huge surprise as I know a couple people with bpd (including my mom) and have always felt like I'm very different from them.

I did some research and became even more confused. I relate to some of the traits and then some others on a very low level, like the anger issues, black and white thinking and impulsivity are definitely there but never enough to really cause much trouble in my life. I actually tend to have very stable long-term friendships and healthy relationships. I am a highly emotional and sensitive person but I try my hardest to not let it affect the way I treat others.

The most confusing parts were the favourite person and feeling of emptiness. I love people very deeply but those feelings usually don't just go away, even if a person hurts me i try my best to see all their actions in context and talk things out. My friends often joke that I'm a very low maintenance friend because I don't expect much from them and get immense joy from even small acts of care/affection. I actually have a problem with letting go of people who hurt me because I genuinely feel deep connection to everyone I love.

So yeah the emptiness is not there either. Even when I was in deep depression still living with my abusive family I didn't feel empty, I felt miserable. I've always felt things very strongly, only going numb when I am overstimulated and cannot take in anymore or im too dissociated to feel anything
 But that doesn't happen that often.

I'm not a profesional so I don't wanna say I was misdiagnosed but I have to wonder if someone can have BPD even without these major diagnostic criteria? Also what do i do if it was a misdiagnosis? How do I get a proper diagnosis? How can I make sure this doesn't happen again?

I feel so fucking alone. I live with my parents, I have a couple friends I see occasionally, maximum once a week. I started going to a writing club with like minded people and that helped a little, but there is a layer of emotional intimacy missing from it all. 
I feel like no one around me understands, they just seem kinda concerned and unsure whenever I talk about my challenges in life in normal conversation. The only person who I felt like really understood is my ex cause they have BPD too, we're still friends but don't talk that personally lately. 
It's just like walking around as a ghost everyday. I stopped dating for now because I had like 4 failed relationships within 12 months and realized that had gotten out of control.

Am I in the wrong here?,1715845839,"My partner has BPD, I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm *very* understanding and try my best to take every precaution possible with all interactions so as to not set them off. 

With that being said, I think I did everything possible to cover the bases here. 

My partner was at work today and didn‚Äôt bring food. Normally, when they don‚Äôt bring food, they go out to a nearby restaurant to grab something, and I offer to bring them something roughly half the time, but am never taken up on it. 

Tonight, I offered to bring them something an hour after their shift started. I was turned down as usual. A few hours later, they texted me to ask if I was busy, so I said no, taking the trash out and trying to figure out what I‚Äôm gonna do for food. I asked if they wanted me to make them anything? No. Would you like me to get anything and bring it to you? No. 

So I thought okay cool, they‚Äôre gonna go grab something like they do 99/100 times. I figured I wanted to go get something, so I did. But I also grabbed them a drink they love and saved them some of my food to surprise them when they get back. 

They called me on a break a few hours later, and asked what I ended up doing. I told them what I did and that I brought them home some stuff for when they get back home. 

That set them off - why didn‚Äôt I bring them anything, why didn‚Äôt I ask if I could get them anything, I‚Äôm so inconsiderate, I don‚Äôt think of them. 

I responded saying of course I did, I did everything I mentioned above. Not good enough. Eventually they got more heated, told me to bring them food and hung up. 

I didn‚Äôt move, I was pissed, and 5 minutes later, they texted to ask if I was gonna get them anything. I said sure, and drove food to them. 

They get home from work, and are blaming this whole thing on me, saying I don‚Äôt think of them, I‚Äôm so inconsiderate, I‚Äôm playing the victim, etc.

I want to be there for my friend,1715844544,"My friend suspects that she has BPD, and seems pretty confident in it. I'm not a professional and can't really say, but I believe her. Either way, she is suffering from similar symptoms and not a little. She is going to therapy, but I want to help her out where I can.

Problem is that I am... not great at comforting people. I hear people out, say I understand how they feel if I do, and give advice when I think it might help. The latter doesn't happen often, because I'm afraid that if I give bad advice it's only going to make things worse.

I have my own set of problems, and struggle a lot with talking to others. I rarely start a conversation, I just respond when people talk to me. Which is not often. She is one of two people that have consistently been talking to me despite this, and she has helped me a lot with my problems. I want to do the same, and not because I'm grateful. I just want to help my friend where I can.

I like to think that I'm good at understanding others, but I don't know how it feels to have BPD because I don't have it myself, which is why I asked for advice here.

I'm mostly looking for general advice, because I'm not really comfortable with giving away information about her just like that.

I know me and my ex aren't compatible and I haven't even talked to them in forever so why am I feeling this way?? I ruin everything. I'm new to BPD and have been recently diagnosed so tbh I don't know much about it. So I went to tell my partner that I felt like something bad was going to happen and I need help. It's late so I woke them up. I think they are just too tired to talk but it kinda makes me upset like do they not care about me. I try to think rationally I know it's bc they are tired but I can't help but feel they hate me. After sitting in the darkness with my sleeping partner I've made the best decision to get up and drink. Now I feel fucking miserable and I'm mad at myself for even doing this crap. Why can't I just be a good partner and not think about this person in the past who couldn't give me what I need??

Well last week after years of no contact they message me, wanting to be friends again   
And I KNOW I should have just ignored it

I can rationally understand that I don't get much out of the relationship, and I can emotionally understand that while it feels so euphoric to get attention from them, that attention isn't worth feeling shit all day every day. 

But I have such a hard time letting them go.  I keep telling myself it's a good opportunity to practice DBT skills and get better at regulating my emotions, and that we can have a healthy relationship but even if I put in the work on myself, but idk if that's even a possibility with what kind of person they are and years of past baggage.

Social media worsens Identity Disturbance - Get off them,1715828159,"I was reflecting on my thoughts and behavior this morning. I found dynamic social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube significantly worsen identity disturbance. 

Particularly if you're constantly watching self-improvement and growth stuff. BPD brains negatively frame stuff. Instead of learning, it makes you feel like a failure. It creates FOMO and distorts your values.

I experimented with going off social media completely to observe the stability of my thoughts and values for 2 weeks or so. I could quickly feel the stability and calmer. 

Then I got recently occupied again. I could feel self-harming negative thoughts getting stronger immediately.

So unless you have successfully fixed BPD default negative thoughts on envy and self-worth using DBT and mindfulness for a consecutive period, Get off social media.

I‚Äôve been asking him this for several appointments, and he always told me to wait a few more months to confirm that it wasn‚Äôt something temporary or some kind of hallucination and to rule out any ophthalmological problem. Well, this time, with the confirmed diagnosis of BPD (since before we couldn‚Äôt yet differentiate if it was BPD or BD), he explained that people with BPD tend to have increased sensory sensitivity in addition to emotional and mental issues, so it was probably related to visual overstimulation. I 'confirmed' this by researching a bit more about visual snow on the internet; it seems to be related to visual processing problems in the cerebral cortex. They also somehow related it to photophobia, a condition I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with, but I‚Äôve never been able to open my eyes properly when there‚Äôs a lot of sunlight, and I can never take pictures during the golden hour (I hate this, I wish I could) because I simply can‚Äôt open my eyes. I feel that everything is related, and I thought it was interesting to share my reflections on this. **Does anyone have similar experiences?**

I have completely blown my life apart.,1715826551,"I was in a severely abusive marriage for 15 years. 
I became disabled due to my mental illness a couple years ago.
My husband would constantly call me lazy for being depressed all the time. I have been in and out of the hospital with SI. Sometimes a few times a year.

Two years ago he convinced me to begin doing online sex work. I did it. Making close to $3k a month, giving him every cent of my disability check and all the SW proceeds. It made me feel like I was contributing and not being lazy for once.

Then he convinced me to take on a poly lifestyle and accept a gf that we both shared.

I eventually became more and more unstable due to the sex work and being sad that he needed another woman to feel sexually fulfilled.

I went into the hospital a few times for wanting to unalive myself because I was so sad all the time between him calling me lazy for being depressed, being treated like a prostitute being pimped, and the loss of my self esteem because of the other woman.

I eventually told him I didn't want to be a SW anymore and I wanted to break up with the girlfriend.

He didn't take kindly to that and it ended in a huge blowout where I yelled at him in the front lawn in front of our kids. I know that was a mistake. I also know that I suffer from severe PTSD because of his abuse. I snapped.

I left him, and he took the kids, telling them that I abandoned them. They believed him and now hate me. They are convinced that the abuse was done by me and not him even though there are extensive arrest records from several times he beat me when they were babies and don't remember.

It's been nearly a year since I left and I barely have seen my girls because they say they don't want to see me.

I reached a tipping point when this week they told me they didn't want me at their band and choir concerts. 

I have cried almost every day for my girls. I miss them so much I want to unalive myself. 

But I did some terrible things the past few days. His gf, the girl that we were both with, lives with him and my daughters. They have begun to call her Mom. 

I wanted revenge. I emailed her job, which is a non profit that provides advocacy to disabled persons in bad situations, about her relationship with my abuser. I even sent them his mugshot and charges.

I wanted them to know that someone who is supposed to care for the abused and disabled is currently in a relationship with a proven abuser.

I am at a loss with my behavior and the level of depression I am suffering from.

I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.

Helpful Strategies I Recommend ,1715822801,"26f Listen I‚Äôm no expert or saint. I believe I‚Äôm a good person who has a lot of work to do. I‚Äôm currently going through a metamorphosis- accepting and forgiving my past self and being serious about working on myself so I don‚Äôt repeat my mistakes. This is how I‚Äôm doing it: 

I downloaded this app called Finch. It‚Äôs an interactive self care app that is mostly free (there‚Äôs a version you can pay for but the free version is pretty good). I highly recommend it, even if you‚Äôre just struggling to get out of bed. 

Research your attachment style. I bought two books on anxious attachment because that‚Äôs what I have and even though I already knew I had that, it really opened my eyes and made my behaviours more clear to me. If you are curious about these books please ask. 

Literally just taking it one day at a time, getting out of bed, going to work, staying busy, being around good people and friends, having small goals I can achieve each day. 

Journaling- sounds simple but I‚Äôve always avoided it. All my counselors were right it does help lol. One thing that was hard for me to do was write down the situations or instances that would trigger me splitting. It‚Äôs hard to acknowledge your wrong doings and take accountability. It‚Äôs scary to admit you weren‚Äôt a good person at times. But writing out your wrong doings helps. Yes, some instances I felt valid in being angry because of how someone else mistreated me - but even then writing it down helps me understand what‚Äôs really in my control and what‚Äôs not in my control. Affirming to myself that I CAN CHANGE. I can do better. I CAN BE IN CONTROL OF MY EMOTIONS! 

Completing reflection exercises such as what I‚Äôm grateful for. 

Taking my vitamins. 

Respecting my boundaries. Not being too available to the opposite sex. 

Taking time to myself. Being out in nature. Not expecting anyone to save me. Not jumping into a new intense relationship (sounds easy). This also includes accepting that certain dynamics and situations don‚Äôt bring out the best in me and to avoid those people or circumstances - for example, it took me 3 long distant relationships to learn that long distant relationships don‚Äôt bring out the best in me. At least not right now when I need to heal. 

No casual sex!!! 

Making new friends. I use bumble bff. And I accept any new friends from this sub even if u need someone to talk or vent to. 

LISTENING AND ACCEPTING the boundaries other people have. 

Again I‚Äôm no saint. I‚Äôm a work in progress. I hope this helps some people. I would love to hear about what works for you! 

With peace and love üíó

Vulnerability,1715817946,"Had my first session with a therapist today, I have been practicing DBT methods for emotional regulation on my own for a little while now and have been seeing some really good results from that, but I still felt kinda aimless, I needed guidance.

We started discussing boundaries and stuff, been having a lot of issues interpersonally because I have been basically walling myself off, not wanting to talk about specific topics, not wanting to know about my ex, instead of being vulnerable, I tried setting up boundaries, but I was just making demands after all. My therapist called me out on it, she explained and at first I was confused, I thought I was quite a vulnerable person and about some stuff I am, but I realised I also use vulnerability as a defence mechanism from talking about what truly was making me feel vulnerable. Stuff I was holding back, yes and stuff I wanted to be vulnerable about, yes, but not the root issue.And the worst part it made me feel better because it was something I needed to discuss with that person, but it wasn't the main thing, I was still hiding.

Honestly this realsation explains a lot and it also explains a lot of other peoples reactions to stuff, people want to care about you, genuinly, they really want to care, so instead of building a wall, be vulnerable about whats really bothering you, it may seem impossible but you can over explain just how painful the thing is for you right now and just how scary it is as many times as you want and eventually that fear will subside.

"My partner (21m) recently got diagnosed with bpd, I (20f) don't really know what to expect/how to help.",1715811771,"I started dating my boyfriend a month ago, though we were quite good friends for \~6 months prior. He was diagnosed with adhd a while ago and was recently diagnosed with bpd. He was diagnosed with major depression in high school, but that has not been an issue for a while. I do not have bpd and he is the first person with bpd I have met so apologizes If I seem ignorant or if I got something wrong, please correct me (he does not have a great understanding of bpd yet either as this is quite new).

From what I have read a lot of people with bpd struggle with intense emotions and unstable relationships. He has a really good relationship with his family and has a lot of long term friends. He is hyper rational and I have not seen him get really upset. I would actually say he is better than the average person at emotional regulation. This is something I know he worked on pre-diagnosis (he did this on his own, not with a therapist). So it does not seem that he struggled with the interpersonal components.¬†

He has a history of self harm, and some suicidal ideation, but far more of it was just self harm (clean for 3 years). He is a little impulsive/an adrenaline junky, though he is a 21 year old guy so some of that's to be expected. Furthermore, I would not classify any of his impulsivity as self destructive. The reason he thinks he got diagnosed is that he has rather intense dissociation. I have only been there for it once, but he doesn't make any sense, seems like he's experiencing entirely different things to reality and he is scared/paranoid. This is why he saw a psychiatrist in the first place. He has around 1 or 2 dissociative episodes a month.

He is rather resistant to treatment. He is prescribed meds for adhd which he almost never takes as he does not like how it makes him feel and he is rather against talk therapy. He did elect to see a psychiatrist as the dissociation thing really freaks him out. He has said that the dissociation is the only thing he would change about his life. When he got the diagnosis, his psychiatrist prescribed him antipsychotics but he never filled the prescription.

Anyways I love this guy, he is ridiculously passionate about life and it's infectious. He is super driven career wise and he has hobbies he really cares about. I love the talks we have and he is just so fun to be around. I also feel understood by him in a way I have not in past relationships. To sum it up, I really want this relationship to work and I don't know what my role in that should be. I would like to help him, but when I bring it up he is somewhat resistant, I feel like he does not want to inconvenience me. I asked him to think about triggers he has so I can avoid them, but he just said he does not have any. He is also very against being around me when he dissociates (which I have fully respected).

Any insight or advice on what to expect going forward or tips on how to be helpful would be greatly appreciated.¬†",Kindly-Daikon7637,,FALSE,1csxkls,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1csxkls/my_partner_21m_recently_got_diagnosed_with_bpd_i/

Dismissed by therapist for BPD episode due to relationship issues,1715808570,"Hi everyone,

The background: 

I am stuck in a toxic relationship cycle from both ends, mostly my fault due to BPD but my partner also has significant trauma. 

I helped my partner get into therapy (finding her a therapist and paying for portions of it) knowing that this would probably end our relationship but cared more about helping her than dealing with a break up.

My partners work with her therapist has lead her to break up with me which I understand. However, my partner broke up with me over text while I was on an airplane yesterday coming back from a trip alone and her therapist advised her to not to response to me freaking out afterwards. Which in my opinion is a really bad thing to suggest to do to someone with BPD and intense abandonment issues. 

Heres the issue at hand currently:

My therapist is in the same practice as my partners therapist. I reached out to my therapist in crisis, freaking out, in the midst of a BPD episode. Saying I needed help and when I didn‚Äôt get a response, I threatened to call my partners therapist (owner of the practice). My therapist offered me a ‚Äúemergency‚Äù session two days later to speak about it. After this, I kept saying I needed help and she ignored me. I then called the practice trying to get in touch with my partners therapist multiple times because I was in BPD rage at this point and felt that no one would help me. 

I got no response for 17 hours from either therapist and then received a discharge letter from the practice today with no other explanation or regard for my crisis. Just saying I was being discharged and recommending other therapists. 

I was in legitimate crisis and their response was to ignore me and discharge me from the practice. I am aware that calling the practice/my partners therapist was inappropriate and wrong but they know I have BPD obviously and was crying for help. 

Is this horrible on my therapist/her therapist/the practice? Or is my BPD just making me overreact to this too?

Thanks in advance.

How do you deal with the fear that you need to isolate yourself from those you love before you hurt them?,1715801266,"Hi everyone. For the past few weeks I've been working with my therapist on the possibility that I might be suffering from BPD. I'm turning 38 this year and I've been struggling to figure out the cause of my pain, my relationship issues, my **severe** abandonment issues, and things like that for years, and educating myself about BPD has been very surreal as I've never before encountered a disorder that sounded so much like *me*.

But this comes with some problems.

I've been with my fiancee for almost 10 years and I love her more than I think I can adequately express. Or at least I think I do. I've been questioning a lot about how genuine my emotions are, before and after this discussion with my therapist (which isn't yet an official diagnosis but we both agree this seems to fit).

For some reason, I have never split on my fiancee. I do not feel intense jealousy about her when she hangs out with her male friends or does things without me (in fact, I often encourage her to do that because we both agree it's important that we each have our own hobbies in addition to the things we do together). I trust her, in a way that I'm not sure I understand when I read more about BPD and the ways it can interfere with romantic relationships. And this can't really be chalked up to a honeymoon period, either--we'll have been together 10 years this summer.

(Admittedly, I don't really split on other people in general. I'm not sure if that disqualifies me from a BPD diagnosis or not. The way I understand myself, my black and white thinking is more like ""I am all bad, and I assume others must be better than me, because surely it would be hard to be worse. Therefore if someone does something bad to me, I likely deserved it, because I am bad."")

But that doesn't mean I haven't been abusive. I've been horribly emotionally abusive to her (never physically--I am not a physically violent person and thankfully never have been). I use my emotions as tools to get sympathy. I subtly manipulate the stories I tell to her to get the reactions I want. I'm trying very very very hard to stop these things but, well, you all know how complicated it can be trying to separate out my real emotions from all of that. I worry that I gaslit her into being with me in the first place (I don't want to completely fill this post with this story but I was absolutely a manipulative, gaslighting monster when she was with her previous boyfriend, trying very hard to subtly break them up).

I am absolutely terrified that I will inevitably hurt her too much and lose her, and it's been hard for me not to feel like I need to remove myself from her life to avoid hurting her in a way I can't fix or take back. Again, not physically, I am not and never have been a physically violent person, but I know I can be very manipulative with my emotions and I feel **tremendous** guilt about that.

I've confessed these things to her but she doesn't believe I could ever do something like that maliciously. She seems to refuse to be angry with me for things that I feel like I really deserve to be at the very least chastised for. But she won't do it. She continues to love and support me. And I am absolutely terrified that I will ruin that and hurt someone who absolutely deserves the world.

This is more of a vent post but i really REALLY need support, or my relationship will crumble. I have been having severe mental issues for over four years and have been diagnosed with BPD around a year and a half ago and am currently getting treatment for bipolar disorder. During that time I have developed a lack of emotions and empathy. Almost 6 months ago I got together with a girl from my old school who i had a crush on for a very long time. When we started dating i finally started feeling some emotions, i felt happy, excited, warm, and loved. She has everything i ever wanted in a partner, she's very kind, loving, empathic and did everything to make me feel good. I felt like she could fix me. After about two months i started losing these feelings and fell back into that vessel-like state. I felt like i started losing interest in her and didn't feel the love anymore, even tho she dearly loved me. I still really care about her, i care about how she feels, what she's doing, what she wants, i keep worrying about her problems and I can't get her out of my head but i don't have the feeling of love. I started telling myself that it's only going to last for a short time but it's been four months and nothing has changed. For the last month I've been telling her this, that I'm starting to lose interest, that I don't feel the same way i did before. (I want to point out that communication isn't really a problem between us, we tell each other everything, how we feel, what we think. She knows about my problems to feel love and understanding it). Two days ago i completely broke down and told her that I don't love her anymore. She ran out of my house and I ran after her. She was crying all the time and I felt like I didn't even care. Later i somehow brought her back to my house so she could rest and we decided to take a break so I can figure out what i feel, and I want to be with her because I know I will never find anyone better than her and at the start i felt like she was my soulmate. 

TL:DR: I really care for her but sometimes i just can't stand being with her which doesn't make sense to me.

My second time posting about this because I don‚Äôt know what else to do with myself, this is killing me and at the very least it helps to vent, i have no one to vent to or to speak to, shouting into the void doesn‚Äôt help, crying about it doesn‚Äôt help, so I might as well talk about it on here. Ive had some lovely people respond to me on BPD subreddits here and I appreciate their support and advice much more than I can express, so if you were one of those people, thank you.

Its been 23 hours since I (M19) last spoke to my fp (M20) after he was sent to the psych ward for what will likely be a week or so, I know at face value it does not seem like a long time but these hours have been torture. We both have BPD and mutual fps on each other, before all of this, we were together 24/7, it sounds like an exaggeration but one look at our call logs and you‚Äôd be mistaken.

This is the first time we‚Äôve had to officially separate for longer than an hour or two, this is killing me.

Thinking if i have bpd ,1715798065,"Im currently dignosed with PDD. 

I recent read alot on bpd, and felt that it relates. I dont want to self-diagnose myself. But if bpd friends can ans my question. I'll be more than happy! Just be nice to me plz :"") 

Personally im super confused with my feeling and thoughts and sometimes may not conciously notice. If you read through this, you'll realise that i mostly focus on the sensations of my body/ feelings because im so confused myself.

- The biggest giveaway for me is the fear of attachment. This one gives me a lot of pain. I soon learn this idea for someone with bpd to be called FP.
From whatever memory that i have since 13, I  always had that one person that I will think about all the time. The one person is decided based on my feels of ""this person will save me."" I know that they can because my heart beats really fast and it feels like anxiety and i will be energized but honestly, im not sure. Maybe its admiration? Or im just scared of the person. Thoughts? 

If i counted right: i have 7 of these persons till now. 
Im 17 turning 18 this year. And as it changes, the previous ones i slowly care less. But i can never forget them. And everytime I think of them, it hurts so bad. Its been 6 years since and i still feel the pain. And it didnt help that my 7th person is my therapist. Ded. Its been 2 weeks. I look at her chat everyday hoping for her to reply to my text. Its been 5 days! Im going crazy. I've been unable to sleep unless i cut myself, i ve been crying in my room and can you believe its all over waiting for a text? 

I remember lashing out at her saying these exact words. I rarely lash out at people.

""I wish i never trusted you! I care too much about and now it hurt so freaking much. This is too much i cannot. Its so hard to breathe. I hate this i hate you i wish i would just die. Im sorry im sorry im sorry. I cannot let it go. I just want to disappear""

I was crying while typing this in my room because it was the last few lessons and im just griefing. Hating. I wanted to die. 

Anyways haha im not functioning now because honestly i dont know i've been feeling like a zombie all the time and im going to kill myself. Anyways, people r gonna leave again. I dont think I devaluate these people though.

- This brings me to the part on emptiness. I personally dont know if its a subjective/ personal feeling or is it universal. But I the feels is tired and numb. Very tired and numb. Sure, i can pull out some energy. But once energy is gone. That's it. How does emptiness feel like? 


- anger, this is one that i cannot resonate with the most. Because whenever im angry, i tend to hind it within myself. However whenever I feel anger, especially to my mother the most, i will be so ANNOYED with her that i give her passive aggressive comments. But i dont know why. Its almost like if she dies i wouldnt care. I feel so much guilt saying this...

Usually to friends, i just keep it all within myself, i wouldnt lash out, because people would hate me. 

- self harm: i've been self harming everyday since my therapist left. Ofc there'll days of no self harming because im too physically tired from lack of sleep and all my school work. But im defo planning something. Average self harming.. maybe 3 times a week? But sometimes i can stop for a few weeks? 1 month? 

SI happeneds every 3-6 months. I've attempted 2 time alr

-Self-image: the things I know about myself is that I am an advocate for mental health if that is considered? Things i like include conversations with people. Things i dont like? Myself?

Is this even considered? Idk! 

- emotional instability: i think it means mood swings. Honestly I dont know what mood swings is because im not aware of the change. However, i feels like the most significant mood changes i can notice can ve that can be very depressed alone and happy when i am with people.

There's a more subtle one which i dont know if it considers. I remember that during a camp, it felt like all my group mates were againts me and hates me, because of all the dry response, the lack of interaction they give me and their judgemental eyes. And the fact made me spiral down and down and down until it felt like it was too demoralizing. I think what happened after that was i gotten very quiet. And the best thing i could describe or visualise that moment was that my heart had a sour pain and  my ears start to have the sound of those flat lines you see in the hospital when the heart is not pumping.  Can i go from my chronic feeling of emptiness to dispair and call that mood swings? 

There's another one called dissociation and paranoia, im still knew to this but im becoming more concious of it. I remember the first time when i was super cautious about dissociation was during my lasy therapy session, i remember what she said or asked but i suddenly stop thinking and feeling, like i cant remember what my therapist asks me.  And even if i think long, im not able to think through and so i gave some random answer. As for paranoia, im not quite sure, is it the same as anxiety. As for me the closest i can think of is that i feel like something is wrong with me and something bad is surely gonna happen to me. I dont feel safe. 

Yep, so far this is it. Im not going to diagnose myself but maybe if bpd friends here resonates, im going to find my psychiatrist. Thought thoughts ! Thank you.

F28 can't stop wishing my high school ex would talk to me again,1715797262,"I self sabotaged this relationship a few years ago, and then I got into a near death situation and came out the other side with so much clarity that I completely changed my whole life. One of those realizations was how supportive and kind this ex was, and how few people I've met that were so lovely to me even through all my drama and the crap my family put us through. I know I've fixated on this relationship and I have a few theories as to why, but it's been over a decade since we were actually together and a few years since we last spoke. 

He was my first boyfriend, he was always open to communicating even after we broke up, and even still years later when I came at him with toxic energy. I was in a fucked up place when I ran into him and burned that bridge with a lie I knew he would never forgive. Post near death experience, I've been worried about running into him again and how he might look at me or avoid me because of the lie I told to keep me away from reconnecting with him ever again. 

I'm currently in a very supportive relationship and it pains me that I spend so much time thinking about this person I don't even know anymore like my current partner isn't good enough.

I tried to craft a message to this ex to apologize and contextualize what I said in hopes of regaining the friendship but I retrospectively should have spent even more time crafting that message before I sent it.

What medication have you found most beneficial for your bpd?,1715792035,"Hi there, I‚Äôm a 25yo female who got diagnosed with bpd recently. Last year I went through a super traumatic event that included a lot of abandonment. At first I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ptsd, however after seeing a psychiatrist earlier this year he diagnosed me with bpd as well. 
I‚Äôm currently on sertraline (max dose), Clonazepam and co quetiapine. I use the sertraline mainly for my depression, and I‚Äôve found that it saved my life last year (mainly by making me feel numb lol). The Clonazepam has helped me with anxiety attacks and more recently, bpd episodes. The quetiapine I use for sleep, as I can‚Äôt fall asleep naturally. Honestly this cocktail of medication is working okay, I just wanted some advice on what other medications work for others, especially bpd episodes since im a bit new to this.

so for some context i (18f), have suspected that i have bpd since 2021. i was diagnosed by my psychiatrist in march of this year. 

my fear comes from the severity of my symptoms. i meet all of the criteria and they do genuinely disrupt my daily life, but sometimes i wonder if i was diagnosed correctly because the symptoms i do have aren‚Äôt as intense, i suppose, as other people with bpd. 

it also seems as if they‚Äôve become more apparent too recently. i understand that as you get older, more symptoms will sometimes start to appear but if feels like it‚Äôs happened too quickly for me to have not manifested them. 

i‚Äôm just worried that i don‚Äôt meet the criteria as strongly as i need to for the diagnosis to be valid. i have problems with impulsivity that come from needing a dramatic, immediate change but it‚Äôs more like cutting bangs and dyeing strips of my hair rather than my whole head and doing something drastic, etc. but the impulsive behavior i have is out of the norm. i‚Äôm pretty straight-laced which is why it‚Äôs so extreme for me. 

the other thing is that i feel like because i haven‚Äôt attempted, my diagnosis doesn‚Äôt count. i‚Äôve had recurrent thoughts of suicide since 5th grade, to the point that they‚Äôre just always there like a voice in the back of my head. but i don‚Äôt know what comes after this and that‚Äôs why i haven‚Äôt done it.

during new years, i was abroad visiting family so i wasn‚Äôt able to talk to my friends or boyfriend as much, especially because of time zones. because of that, my best friend and my boyfriend started talking and spending more time together on games. i didn‚Äôt have a problem with this at all as i trusted both my friend and my boyfriend. this is relevant, please just bare with me.

at some point my friend told me he knew something about me i never told him and part of me genuinely knew exactly what he was talking about and my heart sunk. i gave them the benefit of the doubt and asked what it was, and it turns out my boyfriend told him about the things i thought he would never tell anyone.

i‚Äôm really losing hope for life. i told myself i wasn‚Äôt making it to 16 then 18 then 21, 30‚Ä¶ now i have a little sister who needs me more than anything and a fiance who would be devastated if i left.

i have no money, don‚Äôt have kids because im terrified of child birth, struggling to find something to eat by the time i go to sleep at night. i live in a mostly safe environment- a mental health rehabilitation program with my fiance who never leaves my side. i only say mostly because some effed up shit has happened to me in this program‚Ä¶ 

can‚Äôt get someone to hire me, constant triggers, wrong therapy methods but can‚Äôt afford a good therapist, never traveled outside my area, can‚Äôt make friends even though my fiance is really trying his best to get me good friends but everyone is strung out where i am and deceiving.

i had a BPD episode that lasted a few days leading up to a meltdown today. 

i looked at my fiance and asked ‚Äúif life doesn‚Äôt get any better, can i ‚Äî‚Äî myself when i‚Äôm 40?‚Äù and i think he almost cried when he laid his head in my lap. 

it would give my siblings time to grow up and hopefully gain independence.

i know this is selfish which is why i want to ask- does life with BPD get better or is this it? is there any success or is it just relapse after relapse? 

i don‚Äôt want to leave anybody behind and i don‚Äôt want my siblings to go through that pain but i can‚Äôt stand it here. my only wish is to travel and i‚Äôve never been outside of the city also have no money. that‚Äôs all i want. i feel like it would be therapeutic and make me see the beauty in life.

all i see in the city is addiction on every street and so many people suffering and just looking like they‚Äôre at the end of their life even when they‚Äôre not showing any gray in their hair.

Does this sound similar to bpd?,1715793373,"
Awhile back i made a post about a situation with my friend and a couple commenter's said it sounded similar to the way someone with bpd acts. 

I was wondering what you all thought? 

I know she can't be diagnosed over the internet. I just love her a lot and I'm so confused by her behavior I guess im searching for any reason to make sense of the situation. 

............................................

Awhile back my friend told me her therapist said shes avoidant. I'm not sure if it's more dismissive or fearful but my guess is fearful.

We've always had a slightly tumultuous relationship. & learning she's avoidant made past things make sense. Ive known her for 10+ yrs, both girls. Sometimes we're so close & she's always called me her soul mate. Then (what feels like) out of no where she'll shut down or get distant. Ive learned to give her space after a lot of trial & error. & I especially know now that ive learned some about avoidant attachment. 

Anyways she's getting married this year & I'm not sure if she wants me there or just in her feelings or what. I want to support her but am very confused. 

A yearish ago she sat me down & semi friend broke up with me saying I make her feel guilty/she doesn't feel like she makes me happy etc. That I didn't have to answer now but to think about if we really make each other happy. 

Then she went on a trip with her bf/family, got proposed to, accepted & when she got back asked me to pick them up from the airport. I was surprised but figured this was her quirky way of waving the white flag. 

Things seemed okay between us & then she comes over to hang out one day & is in her feelings wanting drink. She ends up clinging to me, crying, telling me she doesn't want to marry her fiance, doesn't want to lose their friends/family if they break up, tells me I'm her soul mate/best friend & feels safe with me. During this time she mentions the avoidant therapy thing. 

The following few months, when we meet up she's telling me all the reasons she doesn't want to marry him but also they're in couples therapy etc. Etc. I just listen giving her a space to vent no opinions. 

Then I don't see her for a couple months & when I do she's in full wedding planning mode. Again I'm a little surprised & mention something like I'm glad they've worked things out. She just laughs, says what do you mean we were ways getting married everything's great. Like nothing ever happened. I just say congratulations & leave it at that. She asks me to be a bridesmaid, I say of course. 

We go on a couple group trips my fiance & her & her fiance + some of their friends. 
& I can tell after the 2nd one she was withdrawing from me. So I didn't reach out to her for awhile til she did me. We hang a couple times, I thought things were OK. the 3rd time we hang out. We get into a bit of an argument. 

She's grilling me about when I'm going to get married/details & I'm trying to tell her i have no details to give her & were not moving at the same pace as her & her guy. 

Then she tells me again that I still make her feel guilty & doesn't enjoy when we hang out anymore. But loves me & wants me in her wedding. I'm very confused. 

Now I can't help but wonder if I'm just in the wedding party cause she feels guilty/obligated. 

At the same time I'm trying to remember that she feels guilty alot. She vented to me about how her fiance & different members of her family make her feel guilty. She feels guilty if she doesn't complete a to do list etc. 

So i guess im wondering if this seems like her going through something avoidant related & I should wait it out/give space. 

Or if she means what she says, I make her feel guilty & truly doesn't want to be around me anymore. I feel confused & like I shouldn't be in her wedding in that case. 

........................................ 

So that's the current situation.  
Not mentioned in the story is I know she's always struggled with anxiety, depression, ocd, insomnia/night terrors. She's always had a weird tendency to run away (figuratively & literally) when upset/overwhelmed with emotions. At the same time she is one of the most intelligent/accomplished people I know. She's a perfectionist and sets and accomplishes goals in a way ive always admired. ",fiddlefaddling,,FALSE,1csq77w,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1csq77w/does_this_sound_similar_to_bpd/

Over the past six months I have become very close with a person who has untreated BPD and became their FP.

We left things on relatively good terms ‚Äì though they said they are not currently, and may never, be able or ready to receive treatment, we hashed some things out, let each other know we still care about one another, will miss each other, and wish each other the best.  
  
While I understand this person may never receive treatment and that our friendship may be over, I want to be as prepared as possible for (should it ever come) the day they tell me they‚Äôve began treatment and would like to reconnect. I am committed to making the friendship work, being a support for them through the good (which has been some of the most fulfilling friendship I have ever experienced) and the bad, and doing what I can to ensure our friendship is healthy for the both of us.

We have had conversation about this problem many times and I know certain things would make me feel less distant from her , I have identified these things from observation.


So a few days ago she went away for some work , it's temporary stay and I started feeling very aloof from her . I couldn't feel like I was worth anything to her and so I started withdrawing . Today I texted and asked her that maybe it would help if she said certain reassuring things but she says she feels burdened because I don't improve and instead just tell her to make me feel good . 

I don't agree infact I felt insulted and hurt beyond limit . I am not someone who asks for help forget being vulnerable and I had thought since we talked about this and she agreed that she will do her best it was okay to directly ask her for help . I don't know what I did wrong and I feel horrible for opening up .

I feel like I just asked for some reassurance because for the past few days our chat was silent as she doesn't like to text people if they aren't talking to her themselves. I thought it was selfish of her to think that way when I shamelessly opened up about my falws and told her exactly how I feel , why I feel and how I would need her help and despite that she didn't say or text anything reassuring but just did exact opposite.

I communicated my needs and I was told to just improve if I am aware of the problem instead of burdening her by asking for these things. Am I in the wrong ? 

Also I am not going to stay like this forever, I don't mean to say that I won't help myself so it's her responsibility to do so but I feel isn't it basic to cheer up your partner if they need help and communicated so .

They're different stages of my life and maturity levels and they each are in control of certain things in the brain room.

Losing My Dog and Best Friend,1715778704,"Back story: I am a single 38m that's been homeless for the last seven months with my dog. We have been staying in motel rooms and my car with a little help from friends here and there. I have no family to lean on because of the abuse I went through. I do have a full-time job but it doesn't pay enough with the cost of living here in this city.

My dog has been my companion for the last 5 years. He sleeps with me at night. We play together outside. He's been a support for me when I have feelings of being abandoned and unloved. When I take care of him, I have the drive to take care of myself. 

Despite all these benefits my dog offers me, I am unable to get him registered as an emotional support animal (ESA). (I have done EXTENSIVE research on this and pursued this option with several licensed clinicians.)

I was only officially diagnosed with GAD about seven years ago. But I am convinced I was wrongly diagnosed. I took a personality test back in March and I am STILL waiting on my therapist to finish her report and discuss the results. I highly suspect I have BPD and ADHD, which would explain many of the difficulties I am having.

Last Sunday, my money dried up and I had to move out of the motel room we've been staying in. I've been in my car the last three days, been unable to go to work, and all because I still have my dog.

How is my dog keeping me from going to work? Let me explain. My dog, a boxer mix, needs a safe place to stay for 10 hours a day. It is against company policy to leave him in my car in their parking lot while I go inside. Even if I peridoically check on him and give him plenty of water, leaving him in a hot car is very dangerous. So this is not an option.

Why don't I get a friend to watch him during the day? I have reached out to multiple people over a span of several months. No one has the means to take care of him while I go to work. He doesn't require much care; just give him a fenced in plot of land and he'll run around all day. But, still,no one is able to or willing to help me.

Why not surrender or rehome him? I've been fighting this option for as long as I could. The moment I finally decided to give him up is also the moment I learned no one will take him. Animal shelters and the Humane Association are full. Additionally, they only accept surrenders from local residents. They determine this ONLY by either my car registration or my driver's license. Because I do not have a permanent address and what is listed on them is from another state (U.S.), they will not take him. I have also posted online for help and rehoming. No luck there either.

The moment I am forever apart from my dog is the same moment I'm admitting myself to a hospital and that would be a minimum 72 hour visit. But the pain of being forced to abandon my best friend is unbearable. Why am I forced to cause him to suffer so I can continue to live? It doesn't seem fair. He is not a bad dog in any way. But no one will take him and give him a good home. And as much as I have tried, I can't take care of him anymore.

Constantly looking for the next relationship?,1715775476,"Basically, almost everyone I meet becomes a potential partner in my head. 

My brain immediately starts picturing us dating, and I don‚Äôt understand why. It feels like I‚Äôm desperate for a relationship, but I know that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs best for me right now. 

Even in past relationships (which never lasted more than a couple months) this would happen. For example, I would be dating my partner and someone at a coffee shop would be extra kind to me. I am suddenly thinking about this ‚Äúpotential‚Äù future I have with them and thinking about breaking up with current partner to date this person. This is irrational and I know it. This happens to basically everyone I meet. It‚Äôs so hard to deal with because my brain is constantly looking for the next best thing. It makes me feel terrible.

I don‚Äôt make any advances with these people that I picture myself with, because I know it is not rational and not okay to flirt with everyone I have these feelings for. It just confuses me so much as to why this happens.

She was pretty pushy in the beginning about wanting to meet, wanting to date and was really in to me. After a while I finally gave in and said we could meet. She I'd a college student and also works so she's busy and I understood that.

She has 1 year of college left and she said after that she wanted to move and would move to be with me if everything worked out. I had a lot of skepticism but she kept assuring me it's what she wanted and it would be okay.

About 2 weeks ago we had a misunderstanding about our level of communication and she freaked out and told me she didn't want to talk to me anymore and blocked me everywhere. About an hour later she unblocked me and told me she over reacted and was sorry. We talked it out and she assured me everything was okay. We agreed to meet in person, picked a future date and I bought a plane ticket. 

The past 2 weeks she has been extremely busy with finals so we haven't gotten to talk much. I've been really supportive and patient with her. She kept apologizing for not being able to talk much, and I kept assuring her it wsd okay and I understood. She kept telling me that as soon as this semester was over she would dedicate more time to me.

Hi!
I, 29/F, recently got diagnosed with EUPD and Anxious avoidant PD and currently on mood stabilizers and therapy. My psychiatrist is also suspecting that I also present symptoms of ADHD but that verdict is currently on hold.
I felt like a wave of relief washed over me as I finally knew the answers to my lifelong troubling symptoms, which hampered both my personal as well as professional relationships. I found a new hope to finally work on myself to make things better.
But when I shared this information with my SO (hoping he would be understanding), his reaction hurt me immensely. He quite coldly responded that I can't play the 'oh I have a fancy disorder sympathy card' as an excuse for my mood swings, impulsivity, poor self image and pessimism. And not being able to concentrate on work, hobby hopping and forgetting to do chores are just due to laziness and lack of accountability (followed by a condecending chuckle). Now he is not talkting to me and acting all cold and detached. He also tried to break things off but I begged him not to out of guilt. I don't know why I'm feeling guilty.

Are my main BPD struggles anyone else's struggles too?,1715757714,"***very long read so strap in babes***

I do not know anyone personally who has BPD or any mood/personality disorders, so I often don't get a chance to explain my struggles to someone who has personal experience with them or something similar. 

Because of this I feel so stupid and small and inadequate like ""am I just that high maintenance?"". I feel crazy when trying to explain to someone, w/o bpd or any experience with it, how my episodes don't reflect who I truly am.

So with that, here are my most debilitating bpd struggles:

--I am SO hypersensitive to any real or perceived criticism or microexpression. I could tell myself over and over again about how my worries are not based in fact and I will still believe someone hates me. I have gotten way too good at reading body language and adjusting what I say accordingly bc of this. It's very exhausting, and trying to explain myself just sounds like I'm fake and manipulative

-it physically hurts when I'm in a sadness episode. Not even just the headache I get after, but my chest hurts and I feel sick. My emotions are on a tightrope and any nudge either direction sends me plummeting. For example, today's events. I am in beauty school and it is crunch time to study for the state tests. I walked in and was immediately confused and couldn't figure out how to set up my kit. It was loud and eventually I gave up and couldn't hold my tears in anymore. I cried in the school bathroom for nearly 2 hours. I have no control over my big feelings


-in my day to day life, I am alone in the sense that no one will truly understand the mental anguish I have 24/7 and I worry about how people think about me because of it. I'm so scared that everyone in my life just secretly hates me bc they hear/see me and think I'm a monster. It feels like one day everyone will leave 

-everyone overestimates me in my ability to function ""normally"". Being told to just think the opposite of my fears and me sitting there not having the energy to explain how it's not that easy and how it will never be (for the foreseeable future). And ofc this files into my anxiety about how people see me

-I worry I stress people out with my emotional baggage

-I still live in the house I have for my whole life, but I never feel safe or home. All I see is how much remodeling has taken away everything that stuck out most growing up. The hole in the bedroom door that was there when we bought it has been replace with a brand new door. My entire bathroom went from being straight out of the 90s to fancy tile floors and a glass shower. The TV that used to sit on a small cabinet for forever is now mounted on the wall, and I keep begging my mom to let me keep it for when I move out. 

-^^^side note about this last one. I am incredibly sentimental and attached to a lot of things that I have. Not in a material/monetary sense, but in the sense that these things hold so many memories in them, especially my baby blanket and my childhood stuffies. One of my greatest fears is my house burning down and all of those things going with it. Along with this I mourn and cry over my childhood that was just perfectly normal and a healthy upbringing. I feel guilty bc I have nothing to mourne in theory, but on the inside I can't deal with the fact that I am supposed to now navigate a messed up world in my 20s. 

I also have noticed that sometimes I have age regression and need help doing mundane things like opening packages.



Tldr, I feel like a freak and that everyone hates me and can't find a way to rip off the bandaid and leave. I feel really sad about all of these things all the time, but I'm lucky to have a wonderful and supportive partner.

Updated Dx! ,1715766445,"Hi all! today my PD diagnosis has been updated from:

>PD-TS w t/o HPD, NPD, BPD, DPD, AvPD and OCPD (in order of severity with HPD, NPD and possibly BPD being full disorders)

to

>NPD & BPD w t/o HPD and OCPD

AvPD traits were better explained by NPD and HPD (inability to regulate self-esteem internally). 

No explanation as to why the DPD traits r gone. Probably better explained by BPD? 

I have worked hard on myself and this is visible in the dimished HPD symptoms as that went from my worst cluster B to only traits! 

I'm very happy I finally have a ""full"" BPD diagnosis as it is more validating than traits to me, and fits my experience better.

I also had the preexisting diagnoses:

>PTSD (in remission) 

>PTSD under 6y/o (replacement diagnosis for C-PTSD as we go by DSM) 

>Alcohol use disorder (in remission) 

>Drug induced manic episode (very speculated, some agreed some didn't. either way, inactive)

>ADHD predominantly inattentive type

and now with the wonderful addition of:

>GAD

I've been waiting on that anxiety disorder diagnosis, I've been struggling with it all my life and at least now I can pick my anxiety meds up without paying for them.

I feel like this is a good moment to stand still and look at my progress (diminished HPD, addiction and PTSD in remission) and have hope for treatment that is to come.

Advice for managing extreme and over the top anger when playing any kind of competitive video game while still being able to play them?,1715766293,"
I find that preventing myself from getting angry at online competitive games is almost impossible. I‚Äôve been trying to play a few more competitive games, and across the board I get so so so angry when anything doesn‚Äôt go my way. Sometimes in chivalry 2 I run in and die 3 times in a row without killing anyone and I start spiraling and get so angry I‚Äôm tempted to break my laptop and it pretty much ruins the whole day most times. Once I got destroyed by this one guy so bad in tf2 that I had to leave the house and sit outside for like an hour because I was convinced I was about to hurt myself from how angry I was. Sometimes I do hurt myself from anger, I punch myself a lot, and I can‚Äôt play with anything sharp near me. It gets 20x worse when they shit talk or T bag or anything like that. It sucks because I like the games I‚Äôm trying to play, they‚Äôre fun, but if I‚Äôm not destroying everybody and / or I die a few times in a row or I‚Äôm getting trash talked it just makes me so unbelievably upset that it‚Äôs impossible for me to enjoy it. Just a few hours ago today I dented my desk and almost broke my finger doing a quick match to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù because I was doing really bad. 

I still want to play them though, I know the obvious answer we is just to stop playing but I‚Äôm hoping for method of controlling myself and limiting frustration that also still let me play competetive games, because I still really like them and I don‚Äôt want to let this control my life by ruining everything I enjoy on top of 98% of things I don‚Äôt enjoy. I‚Äôve already had to completely give up on learning a bunch of games my friends want me to play, like siege and tekken, because games with high skill ceilings that it‚Äôs super easy to get dominated at are basically unplayable for me with how pissed I get.

Dont know if im overreacting ,1715757570,"So my significant other used to have feelings for one of their friends, I say USED to but im not fully sure. They used to hang out a lot even to a point where everyone thought they were together. Ive tried really hard to not have issues with their friend, and let then hang out with us as long as im around. Anyway, this one time we were hanging out they were very touchy, and they held hands in front of me. I was very upset by this and my SO didnt understand why until like a day later. They still play games with their friend and everything. After a few incidences of hanging out and the light touching and everything still happening I confronted their friend and had told them how I felt. A day later, out of my presence, the two made a joke at my expense about me expressing my concerns and wanting to put up boundaries. Yesterday they were playing games together and i overheard a slight inappropriate comment. I looked over at them and they told me it wasnt toward their friend. We talked today and they had told me it upsets them that they have to watch what they say around their friend as to not upset me. And it hurts that I feel like Im keeping them from their friend, but at the same time I feel like its wrong that they'd want to do those things with a friend when theyre dating me.

How do I get a diagnosis for BPD or another disorder (Canada)?,1715756803,"PS I live in Toronto.

Could I just go to a clinic and mention I want to talk to a psychiatrist and get assessed? I don't want to self-diagnose but I'm very sure I have BPD. But then again, it could be comorbid with something else and I'm just not sure. 

I moved here from a smaller town and I have a family doctor there but everytime I go to him he's either 1. prescribed me medication that did more harm than good (75mg of Zoloft that caused terrible anxiety and I was also passing out a lot) or 2. dismissed what I was feeling for the most part. This is why I'm trying to avoid going to him until there's no other option.

The thing is I have feelings for him. I keep picturing how it would be Ike to kiss him. Getting closer with him. I got him a job where I work at so he can save up to move. I even plan on moving with him so I can leave my hometown with him. (Which is probably a bad idea) But every time I work with him I go crazy I can‚Äôt stand it. It‚Äôs like all my emotions are all bundle up in one. Especially when he talks to other people I get super jealous. Especially this one girl he now considers a close fiend too. I feel like she‚Äôs going to replace me. I tell him I don‚Äôt like her because she talks crap but it actually because I‚Äôm jealous. She‚Äôs having a baby and he told me she invited him over when the baby is born and he told me he‚Äôs excited about it. I was so mad.

How do you trust love again?,1715748735,"I am at a hopeless rock bottom right now and it isn't making any sense to anyone, so I am going to try here. It is going to be a long one, so please bare with me.

I grew up in a family where love was limited and conditional, for myself and between my parents. I had watched my parents beg each other for the minimal respect, change, and genuine love. I had too begged for those things from them, in which I eventually developed this disorder.

I have struggled with the obsession of love/true love/soulmates my entire life. I have had countless favorite people, in which I would have given ANYTHING to be reciprocated the kind of love I was willing to give. 

And in all of these endeavors, I acknowledged I do not love correctly. I realized this when I got out of my first relationship when I was 18. I have dedicated the last few years to unlearning these things. I still struggle with the want to control, the games I want to play, the general pull and push. I have been trying.  

I have acknowledged that what I envisioned love in my head is wrong. Love isn't the constant fight for reassurance or the constant proving myself as worthy. It isn't the begging, fighting, or the challenge. 

I have told myself for years, love is in the little things. Love is learning a song on the guitar cause they would love it, memorizing their order so you can surprise them, or bringing a jacket cause you know they would forget one. Love is the small laughs over inside jokes, the loud laughs over little fails, and the shared memories that were created on accident. 

Love was supposed to be in the little things.

But over the last few months, I have been shown a dark side of it. 

I was on a work trip. 

One of my supervisors gave long speeches at dinner about his fianc√© and how their wedding in June is going to be the best day of his life. That same night, we went out for a few drinks. He proceeded to send a few other girls and I messages about ""spending the night with him."" He went on the next day like it was a usual occurrence for him.

I was utterly disgusted. My gut sat in my stomach for days. 

Another one of my supervisors on this trip did something some what similar. He is ""happily"" married to his wife of 17 years with young daughters.  But as happy as this man is at home, he hit on every waitress, took up countless numbers, and would disappear for days at a time. 

Again I was disgusted. I could've easily said this was the work of nasty people, but it got worse...

Once again, on this trip... one of my dear friends/coworker spoke about his plans to propose to his 5 year girlfriend. We were all beyond happy for him. But within the night, he made a closer relationship with another one of our close friends. He started confiding in her of his doubts, how he is not happy, and he doesn't know what else to do, but marry her anyway. He then dedicated the rest of this two week long work trip to his new found interest in his friend. He gave her a sweet little nick name, held her hand, and walked her to and from everywhere they went.

I was very dumbfounded by this information. I was under the impression that they were happy at home and that they had found something people prayed for, but I was wrong.

When I returned home, I received some also unsettling news.

One of my best friends found out she was pregnant by her boyfriend (who is a very very close friend of mine as well). I have known her boyfriend and his family for 10 years, they have been incredible and wonderful people to me and everyone I know. So for the last 7 months, I have watched them prepare for this baby. They are building a house  together along with a life and family. She was so excited. But as of last week, she informed me of him entertaining random women online. She said he described it as a thing that didn't happen before and he did not know who she was.

But Saturday, her and I sat down and talked a lot about it. Turns out, he lied again. He had been seeing these women their ENTIRE relationship. They are having a baby and he is out there with ""random women"" who he has been seeing for years.

I thought I knew him better, but I am incredibly disappointed. This particular event has triggered me beyond belief. I had watched them do my healthier version of love for a long time, only to find out it was one sided.

I began to look at all the long term relationships that have been shown to me in my life. My parents, never have been happy. My aunt and uncle who have been together since they were 14, have one conversation a day about the coffee machine. My friends from high school, who went literal years of break ups and cheating to now hitting 6 years. My friends parents, who have cheated divorced and remarried several times. My other friends parents, who have been on the verge of divorce over small things several times. And now all of these...

I struggle with what is real and what is not. I struggle with trust, intimacy, and connection. But I have been trying to get better with the hope that one day I can be good to someone and they be good to me. I have never cared about money, a nice car, nor a large house. I want to love and be loved and raise a happy family in the healthiest way I can. All in the hopes that i can experience love in the little things, like how I imagined real love to look.

Now I don't know what love looks like. All of my ideas have been disproven. My dreams have been crushed. I am fighting the urge to recluse and regress in all of my efforts in vulnerability, but I am distraught.

I feel like love romantic love is not real anymore. 

I am honestly taking this more towards men than women, because of my sexual orientation and just from personal trauma, but I know that I am not supposed to do that. 

I am turning away from a connection I have been trying hard to sustain and be healthy in, all because I am triggered by the actions of other men, my fears, and my new found hopelessness in love.

And everyone I talk to says this quote I have heard a million times, ""I know love exists because of the love I give."" I understand that love is real, logically, but i want to experience it. I want to know what it feels like to love and be loved, equally and truly. 

But is the pain and dishonesty truly worth it? Is it something I would have to put up with to experience long term? 

How do I even begin to when given this example of modern day ""commitment.""

How to get ex-boyfriend to stop?,1715748719,"I am very exhausted, even more as is usuall. I have a lot off stress at work as I took leadership position for my team. So this for sure doesnt help the situation. But what I seek advice for is my ex boyfriend. 

We were together 4 years and I broke up with him in January for valid reasons (drinking, anger issues, jealousy). Since then it was even worse and I had to block him almost everywhere and even that didnt help because then he continued the pressure even with emails. He was also threathening me that he will hurt or worse himself and it will be my fault, he was blaming me to be hearthless and selfish and on and on. So after threaths I stepped back and unblocked him only on facebook. I am also still contributing for rent even though living elsewhere, because he refuses to move to smaller affordable apartment.

Long story short, my ex didnt change at all. Time and me repeating and explaining the same that I have no interest in coming back didnt help at all. I really cannot continue to hold him above water... I can barely hold myself and my work.

what does paranoia/delusions look like for you?,1715747921,"So, I didn‚Äôt really think I experienced paranoia until recently. It definitely got worse after I had my baby to the point that I had to put a name to it. Turns out, after reading about it, I‚Äôve been experiencing paranoia to some degree for almost as long as I can remember. Here‚Äôs what it looks like for me:

‚Äîfeeling like someone is potentially watching me all the time, even if I do know that rationally this is not likely at all

‚Äîpassing thoughts that there‚Äôs a camera in the exhaust fan in the bathroom, or a drone taking footage through the window. Sometimes this will prompt me to go put on pants if I‚Äôm in my underwear or something ‚Äújust in case‚Äù. I get this exponentially more out in public. As if everyone is staring at me, or if I can‚Äôt see anyone they‚Äôre staring at me from windows, parked cars, cameras. 

‚Äîbecoming somewhat ‚Äúperformative‚Äù in my mundane actions when I‚Äôm completely alone, because I feel as if I‚Äôm being watched and I need to make sure to do things ‚Äúproperly‚Äù so that They(??) can see I‚Äôm doing things the right way 

‚Äîsudden intrusive thoughts about myself, my husband, or my baby getting grievously injured because of some horrible accident, this makes me so anxious sometimes for days at a time that I can‚Äôt stop seeing imminent danger literally everywhere I look. I‚Äôll refuse to leave the house during these times and I‚Äôll refuse to let my husband hold my (our!!) baby sometimes because I‚Äôm that paranoid something final destination will happen. Sometimes I‚Äôm convinced the floor WILL cave in any moment. Gotta touch the gas stove burner switches to make sure they‚Äôre off if I think about them even if it‚Äôs the middle of the night. My husband hates it, he feels me get out of bed and he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúTHEYRE OFF. STOP IT‚Äù so I lie and say I have to pee so I can check anyway 

‚Äîif I hear people laugh out in public, I‚Äôm sometimes convinced they‚Äôre laughing at me even when I know on some level they aren‚Äôt even aware of my existence 

‚ÄîI think the neighbors in the building are listening to the sounds I‚Äôm making in the kitchen or by walking around , and that they can tell what I‚Äôm doing inside my apartment by hearing through the floor 

‚ÄîI have STRONG paranoia that when I take my baby to the doctor, they‚Äôre giving her drugs to slowly make her terminally ill, and they‚Äôre doing it only to MY baby. It‚Äôs so fleeting and it does pass, but in the moment it‚Äôs so strong it almost feels totally real. Like it really worries me about myself. That level of paranoia wasn‚Äôt a thing for me before I had my baby. 

There‚Äôs other instances, but this is too long already. Also, I am almost always aware at the same time that it‚Äôs not real, yet I can‚Äôt stop having the thoughts and feelings. It‚Äôs almost like part of me really does believe it, and sometimes it feels like the rational voice is the delusional liar‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm scared of how paranoid I‚Äôve become.

Obsessive and unwarranted hatred,1715746556,"I find that when I randomly split on someone (for no particular reason) I become angry to an insanely unreasonable degree. I'm not talking about the reactive kind of anger that drives my impulsive reactions to conflict and is caused by my lack of emotional regulation, I'm referring to a simmering anger that's more long-term and less explosive, and is often caused by nothing at all. I just start to absolutely despise people practically overnight. Every single thing that the person does sends me into a rage, no matter how minor it actually is. The hatred lasts months, and has even lasted years in some cases. Sometimes I feel a very strong urge to hurt the person, though I'm confident that I can control these urges, thankfully.

For example, I currently despise my former FP, despite the fact that nothing's changed in her behaviour. She's always treated me slightly poorly, but I never really minded, and have distanced myself from her anyways, so her behaviour no longer affects me. That said, every time she posts on social media, or sends me a text, or does ANYTHING, I am filled with rage. Like, today she posted a random photo of herself on her story and I instantly felt a sense of all-consuming disgust and anger just by looking at her. Honestly, she could literally post a picture of a wall and I'd still find a way to get angry about it. Even the mention of her name pisses me off. Idrk how to describe it honestly, she just can't do anything right in my eyes at the moment, and I genuinely think I might need to block her for the sake of my own sanity.

I was always empty,1715744700,"I struggle with ruminating about my ex.  We had a short relationship that made me feel amazing.  Then one day she left.  For the next few years she would say she wanted me and had made a big mistake, and then date another guy.  Eventually, I got really angry about her saying one thing and doing another and blocked her on everything.  But the ruminations haven't gotten better and my illness has gotten pretty crippling.

So to today.  I had to cancel my DBT therapy because money is bad.  I feel awful and hopeless about getting better.  That led to me somehow decide it was a good idea to unblock her and look at her pictures.  That was like taking a hit of a drug.

Do I tell my sister that our dad is dying?,1715740908,"I‚Äôve tried to keep this brief, advice needed:


My dad disowned my sister. For her BPD. When I objected to my dad, he looked me in the eye and said he was incapable of loving her as she is. So I looked him back in the eye and said ‚Äòthat‚Äôs monstrous. if you want a relationship with me, you have to have one with her‚Äô
And that was the last time I saw him. I would text on his birthday and New Year‚Äôs Day.


That was my choice. As horrible as no contact with my dad is for me, it‚Äôs been absolutely devastating to my poor sister, who did not choose to never speak to him again. His treatment of her is the source of so many hurts.


It‚Äôs been nearly 15 years since that happened. Yesterday, dad‚Äôs girlfriend texted me: my dad has had a stroke and a cancer diagnosis and there isn‚Äôt much time left, will you come see him?


I know they won‚Äôt tell my sister.  My dilemma is, do I tell her now or do I wait until he‚Äôs dead. 


I think the good, moral, correct, fair thing is to tell her right now and give her the opportunity to see him one last time. But I know it will be Devastating. And she‚Äôs been doing so well lately, she even has a promotion interview on Thursday. 


Has anyone been through something similar? Do I lie or do I upend her life?

How to cope with separation from fp and the sudden stop from taking any medication (very venty but heavily seeking any sort of advice or support ,1715727723,"Posting on a throw away bc paranoia

Me (M19) and my Fp (M20) have been in a serious romantic relationship for quite a while, we both have bpd and he‚Äôs being evaluated for possible schizophrenia, we‚Äôve both been open about our mental health and since the beginning, we‚Äôve been open about our mutual fps on each other and due to it, our separation anxiety. Due to recent events which I won‚Äôt go into specifics to in attempts to keep this post as short as possible, my Fp was sent to the psychward for about a week or so, he had to give up his phone just about two hours ago and I‚Äôve been at a total loss, I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself and I can‚Äôt stop crying, I don‚Äôt know how he is, how he‚Äôs doing, what he‚Äôs doing, nothing. We are long distance due to college starting in a few months so I cannot visit him, he wrote down my number before they drove him to facility so he wouldn‚Äôt forget it but it‚Äôs likely they won‚Äôt let him call me anytime soon. I‚Äôm in contact with his mom but our conversations have been limited and I am at a total loss.

I‚Äôve tried distracting myself but there‚Äôs nothing i can do, i have no friends to rely on, I have no enjoyment for anything anymore, watching videos and playing games leave me with nothing, I feel a sense of emptiness so deep that it‚Äôs crippling, I don‚Äôt know what to do. He‚Äôs my support system, he‚Äôs my everything and without him I have nothing and I am nothing, I have awful thoughts and memories that I try to fend away but i cannot, nothing helps and I‚Äôm hurting. I am an artist, I have art I owe that I must work on but I can‚Äôt get myself to do anything, my hands are hurting, I can‚Äôt sleep, I can‚Äôt eat, I can‚Äôt think or I think too much, I still can‚Äôt tell.

The worst part of it all is that I was forced to stop taking my medication suddenly after taking it consistently everyday since April. For some context, i started having an allergic reaction yesterday, mainly just hives, I still don‚Äôt know what from, today the hives were still here even after I spent the day yesterday taking allergy relief and lathering myself up In anti itch shit that really didn‚Äôt help much. I went to the doctor today once they started to swell, initially I suspected my medication because I didn‚Äôt eat or do anything out of the ordinary (i don‚Äôt go outside) but after being seen by the doctor and had blood taken, he ruled it out and I fainted, had a panic attack, had some stuff injected in me and all that good shit. I called my psychiatrist right afterwards for good measure and she was unable to speak with me since she was with another patient but her receptionist contacted me after speaking with her and I was informed to stop taking my medication all together until we could speak. 

My next appointment was meant to be June 3rd but I am considering calling in tomorrow and arranging a sooner appointment or something because I feel like I‚Äôm losing my goddamn mind(

I just feel like I have no direction right now and I miss him so badly im hurting physically and I don‚Äôt know when illl be able to finally hear from him again, I only have him, I have no one else, if he‚Äôs gone, im done for.

TLDR; I was forced to suddenly stop taking my medication due a medical emergency and my fp is being sent to a psych ward for about a week, it‚Äôs been two hours and I can‚Äôt stop crying.

therapy triggers me. but i want to start doing it again,1715731041,"i almost posted this on the talk therapy sub but last time i talked about my symptoms being a barrier to treatment and interfering with my therapy / relationship with my therapist i got a lot of people dogpiling on me,, as if i should just magically stop having symptoms lmao,, i was even asking for help with seeing the more logical reasoning for the situation (since i was thinking in black and white) and people were just shitting on my symptoms haha as if im not mentally ill. that post is still in my history if youre interested. i was actively in an episode at that point so i think its a pretty good example of just how much therapy can trigger me. 

  
anyway, every therapist ive ever had has triggered me in one way or another. and ik its not THEM its ME but its really frustrating trying to get treatment and then literally fucking up your relationship with your therapist so bad they stop working with you \*because\* of your mental illness which you're trying to get treatment for. 

i always either get way too attached and they become my FP (which is a whole issue and really messes with progress) or i start relying on them for emotional validation on a normal level and if i dont get it i will have an increase in harmful behaviors in an attempt to recieve that validation. ive literally never had a therapist that didnt trigger my symptoms in some way \*even\* the ones i really liked and clicked with and was making progress with until i started having an increase in symptoms.

  
i kind of gave up on therapy last year after my fp/therapist ""abandoned"" me (mostly my fault and life circumstances but um,, my nervous system still thinks it was abandonment soooo). i was working with another therapist at the same time for addiction help and dropped him after i split and ghosted my dbt referal after one session bc i felt like she was trying to replace my fp. 

its been months and i was ALMOST in remission but i remitted all my symptoms a month ago and im struggling again and i want to go back to my referrals but im really scared of the same thing happening again‚Äî getting triggered and fucking over my relationship with the ONE person that actually has a chance at helping me (dbt is so hard to come by these days oml). it hurt SO much the last time. and idk how to stop it from happening because obviously i havent fully recovered yet. 

  
idk if anyone can relate pls send some support my way. maybe even good stories of good therapist who stayed with you through a split. or advice so that i can preemptively prepare. i really just want to recover and go into remission but its so, so much harder than it seems. like just going to therapy and implementing it doesnt magically make everything better. and in my case it made it worse for a period of time.

I think I'm being unsufferable for my fiance and I don't know what to do,1715729449,"Hi, 

I (25F) have BPD and have been diagnosed last year. 
My fiance (25M) is being really supportive, we know each other for 12 years, been friend and now we're a couple.

He's an angel but I know I'm complicated to handle. I really try my best, the anger don't always get the best of me because I worked on it a lot. 
However, one night I talked to him because I was feeling lonely and work took our private time away. He talked less and less and slept earlier everyday which made me lonelier. 

Tbh, I know he's working a lot to make us live better, I don't want to be ungrateful but I want to be honest with him completely. 

To resume, we got into a fight, he went to sleep, I cried, he tried to comfort me but I pushed him away as I didn't knew what to do anymore and he went back to sleep. 
The next day he admitted that he wasn't really sleeping, he just avoided me and didn't wanted to comfort me. (it looks made up but I promise he did say that) 
I was shocked, I cried again and he went emotionless as I was really hurt. 

After this I slammed the door, took a bath with some music with high volume and went back to the bedroom as he went back to sleep. 

As I'm a stupid girl with BPD, I apologized for my behavior and let him out of the hook.
Am I stupid ? Why am I like this ? Is it normal for my fiance to became like this ? Is it because living with a BPD person is exhausting ? 
What can I do ? Please I'm feeling so bad to accept this kind of behavior but I don't want to hate him...

Suspected BPD in a loved one,1715728408,"
I‚Äôm currently separated from my boyfriend of four years, he‚Äôs been extremely emotionally abusive lately, a completely different version of the man I met four years ago. I started looking into different things; I myself have Bipolar 1, depression, & panic disorder so I‚Äôm not new to the mental health world by any means. From my experience over the last half of our relationship, especially as of late (we separated about a month ago), he has been exhibiting every symptom of BPD but self-harm. So my question is this‚Ä¶

What made anyone with this disorder seek help, or how did a diagnosis come about?

I am trying desperately to get him to see a psychiatrist, but to no avail at this time. Unsurprisingly, he believes there is just nothing wrong with him. Maybe I am grasping at straws, but obviously everyone with BPD was diagnosed at some point and I‚Äôm trying so hard to figure out what kind of conversation I could have with him to give him a nudge to see if this is something that has a chance of being managed or if he has really turned into this person I can‚Äôt recognize. I have zero intention on informing him of my suspicion, I‚Äôm aware that‚Äôs a horrible idea.

**Disclaimer:** Obviously I‚Äôm not a doctor, but from what I‚Äôve gathered from research, other people‚Äôs experiences, on top of his EXTREME childhood trauma, I believe my assessment is fair for the following reasons:

1. He is convinced I am out to get him (has said this verbatim)

2. He is by far the most impulsive person I have ever met (one week we couldn‚Äôt afford dog food, then he got paid and immediately bought a drumset that he has yet to touch, not to mention two months into our relationship he bought me a puppy, which I loved, but you get the point)

3. His fear of abandonment is beyond comprehension (I would joke that he was the ‚Äòwoman‚Äô in the relationship with his constant need for reassurance that I wasn‚Äôt going to leave him or cheat on him and that I still loved him, my family finds it very odd how often he calls me when I‚Äôm not with him for no particular reason).

4. His anger can get out of control very quickly though it is usually internal and directed at himself, but has lately been projected onto me through screaming, name-calling, insults etc., which will suddenly vanish just for him to ask me to ‚Äúcome cuddle‚Äù after some time in separate rooms. 

5. One day he will believe he is king of the world, he‚Äôs overly confident, posting gym pictures etc. and then the next day he will lie around convinced that nobody likes him, that he‚Äôs a POS, hating himself.",Ancient_Concern_7241,,FALSE,1cs652o,3,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cs652o/suspected_bpd_in_a_loved_one/

i know me and him cut ties because we are both doing pretty bad mentally, i feel as if my episodes definitely overwhelmed him. i want to talk to him again in the future but i need to know how i can manage myself. i have no insurance and can't get therapy or go on medication.

emotion related question,1715719223,"Not really sure if this is bpd related at all, but i‚Äôve been sitting in this for a bit now. 

For context:
I dated a girl for a few weeks, and I must admit things got serious quickly. She asked me to be her girlfriend and I agreed because things felt comfortable and secure. After a week of being official she suddenly told me she wasn‚Äôt so in love after all and just dumped me. I (F,23 w BPD) got very emotional and upset about the whole thing. I realise i‚Äôve only known her for a month and that i‚Äôll get over this eventually, but the thing that upsets me the most is that she (F,21 ) seems totally fine.

 I haven‚Äôt gotten a proper apology for the events that happened as she told me she needed some space (I respected this fully, and haven‚Äôt reached out since the 5th of april) I‚Äôm over her, and don‚Äôt have any romantical emotions towards her anymore. But, i‚Äôm just so 
angry that she‚Äôs fine. I want her to be sad and I feel bad for wishing that? She did apologise shortly in the moment, but I feel like I deserve more. I struggled immensely with relapsing (alcohol) and I don‚Äôt blame her for any of that, that‚Äôs on me, but I just can‚Äôt shake of that deep anger towards her and the fact that she seems pretty unphased by it. I feel used and taken for granted, I secretly wish her the worst and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs upsetting me the most. I don‚Äôt like that I feel like this?! 

I do have a tendency to minimise my own needs and be too apologetic towards people who wronged me, which leads to unresolved feelings of invalidation and hatred for what they did afterwards.. Feels like I want ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù in some odd way? 

Today, I decided to block her so she‚Äôs unable to reach out if she would suddenly decide to do so and give me closure, she‚Äôs been given more then enough time to show some actual respect towards me so, idk? was this the right choice? I‚Äôm also just scared of ending up being the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù somehow for blocking her

Unable to be attached to anyone else other than FP,1715712879,"So I‚Äôm not exactly sure if this is normal with BPD, which is why I‚Äôm bringing up the topic here. 
I have a FP, and we used to be in a relationship. I‚Äôve always been very attached, and we were still as close as when we were together even after we had broken up. In a way, my FP kind of took care of me. Whenever I would have episodes when I was scared of being abandoned and thought I would be replaced, my FP was always very calm and ended up reassuring me.

Disassociated From BPD While Drunk?,1715710653,"Last night I ended up going overboard and drinking considerably too much, but fortunately not enough to forget everything. For some brief context, I had set up a night with my current FP and we decided we were just going to have some wine and chat. 

It turned out to be a fantastic time until getting sick, but what's weird is how I felt while I was drunk. I've never experienced this before but I almost felt disassociated from my BPD. I felt muted, and was surprised that I was not feeling my emotions with the same level of extreme intensity that I usually did. Also, before this night I was constantly writhing about my romantic interest with my FP. I was undeniably in love with her (which caused me a lot of pain since she has a long time boyfriend). But, this night I didn't feel any romantic love towards her. I just felt like we were two great friends chatting and having a lovely time. We were more intimate than ever before--hugging, hand holding, constantly touching each other--which you would think would be my paradise but I actually just felt still like we were friends. 

Then the morning came. Hungover, but still relishing the great moments with her, I wrote her a long string of texts expressing my gratitude and reaffirming my love for her as her friend. Despite saying ""I love you too"" back to me last night, she responded to my texts with three short lines saying she was happy to help and asked how I felt. The short response, not saying I love you, and her ignoring my request to hang out again immediately made me split. I used all my willpower to not totally freak the fuck out, but it hurt so bad. 

So that's where we are now. I am trying hard not to split, but I am in agony over her not being as affectionate as she was last night. I feel more dependent on her than ever before, but I can't tell if my romantic feelings have come back or not. I don't think they have, but more than ever I just feel like I need to hold onto her so tightly so she won't leave me.

Does anyone else think they might have been misdiagnosed? I think I may have ADHD ,1715694440,"And by that I mean that the BPD diagnosis might be the wrong one (or at least not the only one)

I (27f) was diagnosed with BPD 7 years ago. It felt like the most fitting diagnosis at first, but apart from my emotional regulation issues, impulsivity, indecisiveness and feeling empty (frequently, not necessarily 'chronically' though!) I've noticed I'm different from other people with BPD. I happen to know quite a few. Their impulsivity shows in different ways (I have impulsive speech, but I never really lash out at people unless I'm drunk), their self-destructive behaviour is wayyy more intense than mine, etc. 
I'm aware there's over 250 different combinations of having 5 or more out of 9 symptoms (which is the diagnostic criteria according to the ICD-10 and I'm in Europe), and I know there's quiet and less severe forms of BPD. 
However, I have A LOT of symptoms which are not associated with BPD but rather with ADHD. To list just a few, my short term memory is terrible, I'm the most disorganised and messy person I know apart from others with ADHD, my executive dysfunction is ruining my life, I'm both hyperactive and inattentive in many ways. This was already the case in my childhood, but my parents are dead so no one can give an account of that. Also, BPD treatment (therapy and skills training) has not helped with those kinda symptoms at all. The only thing that helps is taking amphetamines lol
I've actually been self-medicating for a while with Vyvanse and it works so well. I've told my psychiatrist about it and he refuses to believe it may be ADHD because it's 'a trend diagnosis' and because my former self-harm is 'proof for BPD'. My therapist on the other hand has been very supportive and trying to help me get a diagnosis. I went to a screening, scored extremely high on the ADHD inventory, but a little too well on some of the cognitive tests, so I just got diagnosed with BPD *again* (even though I got lost on my way there, forgot to bring important documents and to wear a mask during COVID haha). My boyfriend and many of my friends suspect ADHD as well...

I'm frustrated. I feel like my doctor is mostly holding on to the BPD diagnosis because I'm female. And I'm convinced I'm on the wrong medication and that Vyvanse or a similar medication would help me function. But since I already 'failed' the screening, I'm scared of seeking out another doctor. I feel like now, I'll never be taken seriously. 

Has anyone had a similar experience?
Is there any chance at all I might still get diagnosed for ADHD? Should I try? Trying again would cost so much money, and it would shatter me if I don't get the diagnosis, as in my mind, ADHD medication is my only hope.

So I guess I'd be grateful for some advice whether to further pursue getting an ADHD diagnosis or not. Or just some support and reassurance that even if I don't get the diagnosis, there's hope for me.

TLDR: me, my therapist, my bf and some friends are pretty sure I have ADHD. My doctor says it must be BPD and refuses to try new medication. Already 'failed' a screening - try a different doctor anyway or not?",uebea,,FALSE,1crsknd,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1crsknd/does_anyone_else_think_they_might_have_been/
Changing from quiet to petulant BPD? (also undiagnosed),1715665641,"I (22F) have been looking into PDs these past few months and suspect I may have undiagnosed BPD, but I am not sure what type...

I suspect I may have been quiet/discouraged BPD for since middle school since I often struggled with self-hatred (made a ton of self-deprecative jokes) and suicidal ideation (never made any plans, but I often went REAL deep into misery as I convinced myself that everyone around me hates me and would celebrate if I were to kms). I also had a lot of people who might be considered FPs ‚Äî for example, my teachers in middle school and after that it was a bunch of older guy friends who I thought were ""crushes"" ‚Äî but looking back I think they might just be FPs since I would genuinely feel really happy as long as they were willing to stay friends even if I knew it was unlikely to become something more (and plus the one time a guy DID like me back, I cut them off real quick :') ), except my emotional attachment to them was also a lot more intense than what's probably typical for friendship?? Like I had thought ""Even if they end up marrying someone else, I'd still want to stay in their lives as a friend and support their relationship and future kids as like a family friend""

But also recently I went through a pretty traumatic experience with an ex FP, and I kind of wonder if it has pushed me from quiet to petulant/externalizing BPD? Like they repeatedly hurt me/broke trust real bad to the point I can't see them the same (I guess it's like ""splitting"" but it also feels different and more intense/darker than times I've split on previous FPs) and now ‚Äî as bad as it sounds ‚Äî¬†I hate them more than I hate myself and wish they would just unalive themselves?? And it's to the point I'm so consumed with hatred for them that I'm spending less time fantasizing about killing *myself* but I'm not sure this anger and bitterness is healthy either... (Part of me also wonders if it could be comorbid NPD, but I don't feel this sort of intense hatred toward anyone else in my life right now eithter)

Has anyone else had similar experiences of changing from quiet to petulant BPD (or shifting between other different types) due to life experiences?

I only miss that ex because she mistreated me a lot, for example she applied the silent treatment to me or when I told her not to do something because that activated my post-traumatic stress, she did it and that was very intense, a lot of adrenaline for me, every time she gave me little scraps of Love, I felt addicted to it, but also, she wanted me a lot sexually and was the first person I had sex with after suffering sexual abuse.

Took a coping test it was very interesting.,1715682082,"I took this coping mechanism test it was very interesting.

These are my results. Ironically, I am over emotional but this what I try to do to avoid being so emotional.

Detached Self-Soother

You carry a deep longing for emotional comfort, but your caregivers were unable or unwilling to fulfill that need. This has led you to be wary of relying on others. You have developed a coping mode that seeks to numb emotional pain by creating distance from difficult feelings.

You rely on self-soothing strategies such as distraction, avoidance, or numbing to regulate your emotions and alleviate discomfort. Your detachment allows you to maintain a sense of control and autonomy in the face of adversity, but it also leads to feelings of isolation.

Watch for these signs:

Emotional Numbing: You engage in behaviors or activities that numb or suppress emotions (such as overeating, substance use, or excessive screen time) as a way of escaping painful feelings. You find it difficult to identify or express your emotions, and have a tendency to dismiss your own experiences.
Avoidance of Emotional Triggers: You avoid situations or stimuli that evoke strong emotions, preferring to keep emotional distress at bay rather than process it directly. Your life history has made you an expert at creating distractions, keeping your mind occupied by a constant stream of external stimuli.
Self-Isolation: You withdraw from emotional intimacy, preferring solitude or superficial connections to avoid potential hurt. Your need to escape emotional discomfort leads you to neglect important responsibilities or obligations.
Distraction Techniques: You use distractions such as hobbies or work to divert attention from uncomfortable emotions or thoughts, temporarily soothing yourself by avoiding deeper emotional processing.
The Cycle of Detachment: By avoiding your emotions, you limit opportunities to develop healthy coping mechanisms. This leads to increased emotional vulnerability, further fueling your need for distractions and avoidance.
Your coping mode provides temporary relief from emotional distress but also perpetuates feelings of disconnection and loneliness. Without learning healthy ways to regulate your emotions, you risk further isolating yourself from meaningful relationships and opportunities for personal growth.

For me, it feels like hell. I'll cut off people.
I'll stop talking to close family. Impulsive online buying. I'll start feeling like I'm losing my sanity. I'll binge eat, then stop eating altogether. Everything moves at the speed of light.

And the worst of all is waking up from nightmares EVERY-SINGLE-DAY.

I've never been able to cope with it; it usually just fades away after consuming me entirely. I'll start having suicidal thoughts but never act on them. I'll treat people around me like they're nobodies. Sometimes I'll feel like everybody's trash, and then shift to feeling like I'm the most miserable person on earth.

It can last from weeks to months when I don't reach out to anybody and let myself spiral. Thankfully, I have friends who are very aware of this and drag me out of it most of the time. These friends never realized how much they've saved me plenty of times. I am very grateful to have them in my life.

What triggers it is when I don't feel in control of my life, when I'm getting to know new people, when I'm with someone who doesn't know me welli when I'm surrounded by toxic people, when I feel like l've exposed myself too much and start feeling vulnerable, when I feel like I'm failing academically, when I feel like I need to put in more effort but I can't, and when I feel lonely and isolated.

Currently he is not speaking to me for several weeks, and I think that it is because I fell asleep on the sofa while waiting to help him with some medication (for a separate medical issue). I can't think of anything else that triggered it, there was no fight, I guess he just felt like I didn't care enough about him to stay awake.

I am not allowed in the room with him, he comes home late and slams things. When I have offered to help or offer a cup of tea etc, he pulls his hair and looks at me with such rage. He has held his hand up in my face and screamed that he needs space. 

In the past he has only really climbed down from this point when a crisis occurs. E.g. he ended up in icu with high blood pressure, his mum ending up in icu with high blood pressure likewise, or me nearly getting deported because he wouldn't support my visa application. As in a serious crisis. Then once he starts talking again, he expects us all to carry on as if nothing happened. 

This is taking its toll on my own mental health, and our daughter and his mother. I don't feel like he is choosing this, but he won't come down or allow anyone to reach out to him. 

I am scared, for myself (he's not violent, but the look in his eyes terrifies me), for him (he could  easily end up having a heart attack), for our marriage, for our family. 

I would hugely appreciate any advice on how to approach things from anyone who finds themselves in that way.  Do I just give the space he is asking for, even though this could be months, and surely makes him feel more rejected? Or do I keep trying to approach, bearing in my that even the slightest perceived criticism might result in a deepening or a full blow up. 
He doesn't read well, and won't read a letter, he is not responding to messages. He is not in a place to accept that he needs professional help. I'm so lost. 

There is a lot of background and detail I can add if anyone needs to know, but just some basic top tips would be so helpful.

I cheated and can‚Äôt stop focusing on the other woman,1715662455,"I (20F,lesbian) posted this already before but using a different account because I have a new phone. I cheated last weekend on my girlfriend (19F) of over a year with a woman (21F) I was developing a strong friendship with. We got drunk and kissed and although we didn‚Äôt have sex, she slept over and we cuddled. 

I do feel awful about this. Sure I have anxious attachment and BPD. I have a cycle of always having an FP and honestly the time period between my FPs is incredibly short. Sure my girlfriend is more of an avoidant and communicates less. It bothers me but I had zero intention of breaking up and was looking forward to our future adventures. 

I have made up my mind to tell her in one week once finals are over. I would love to say that if she takes me, I am going to work on things. However, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the other girl, even just our friendship means a lot to me. She is very emotionally intense as I am and I crave emotional connection. The other day we had a phone call to cut things off and for clarity, but we ended up talking for 7 hours straight. 

It sucks that I‚Äôll also be halfway across the country this summer for a job, coincidentally not far from her hometown while my girlfriend will be at home. 

I truly know this is bad, but I don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm supposed to make of these urges. How do I go from loving my girlfriend to wanting to throw it away all for a new connection? It makes me feel like I‚Äôm just a shell of a person. Yes I have been in therapy for 6 months and I know I need to keep at it.

Please share positive experiences with your journey with bpd,1715660970,"Hi all. I(24F) recently got diagnosed with bpd and everything makes sense now. However, I wish I didn‚Äôt have this, i wish i could be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. 

My bpd symptoms are only apparent when im in a relationship. With that being said, I think its unfair that the only way to feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is by isolating myself. 

It breaks my heart into a million pieces thinking that the only way to feel sane is by breaking off the relationship I have with my ex. I still have hopes that we‚Äôll get back together, i mean we are in contact and hangout all the time but it breaks my heart that im no longer one of his priorities due to my past behavior.

Im in therapy, im waiting for an evaluation for medication. My therapist told me to not put all my eggs in one basket, to not think that medication will help all my issues but I really hope it minimizes this feeling of emptiness, doubt and impulsivity. 

I go back & forth with feeling helpless and not wanting to let this define me. But recently i cant get the thought out of my head that I‚Äôll never have a healthy romantic relationship. No one deserves to put up with someone like me.

how to cope with fp talking to a potential gf,1715657607,"this is actually my first post so I‚Äôm sorry if this is formatted funny.

but currently for the past week I‚Äôve been dealing (not very good to be honest) with my fp becoming interested in someone else. i don‚Äôt really have anybody i can truly rely on besides my best girl friend but I don‚Äôt want to burden her with all my feelings toward this situation. that being said she knows what‚Äôs going on and is very supportive of me and trying to reassure me that my fp is not abandoning me and still loves me. 

the sucky and tricky thing about this is my fp is honestly a lot like me. he was only interested in being my friend and talking to me and romantically pursuing me (he‚Äôs an ex) but after him cheating on me and just a lot more life things happening I made the almost fatal decision to cut it off. (and I have the kind of BPD where I‚Äôll stay no matter what you do to me so this was hard) beyond a few cheating incidents he really seemed to only want me. always being there for my panic attacks as I have panic disorder and autistic meltdowns and shutdowns and even taking care of me now by helping provide a roof over my head. (my parents kicked me out at 17 so I had been couch surfing and living out of my car for awhile and I stopped being able to work and drive a few years ago due to my mental health getting out of control)

i just can‚Äôt deal with this though. there‚Äôs obviously a lot more to this situation but the bottom line is im struggling so bad (to the point of sh again after a few months of being clean)and need advice on how to deal with this. or maybe just some kind words of encouragement.

I'm 22 f (undiagnosed) my partner is 22 male we got together when we were both 19 we moved in after a week of dating cause we were both basically homeless so we got an apartment together. 19 and 20 where really rough ages for us. He cheated on me and was listing after other women and said a bunch of hurtful shit after cheating in attempts to make me feel better because I was blaming myself and my identity specifically about how maybe dying my hair black would make him love me more. This fucked with my self image so fucking much and I'm trying to undo that. And 21 and 22 have been really good years for us we're both happier and healthier but I suspect he my also have undiagnosed BPD or some other personality disorder idk I'm not a psychiatrist but he too has that crazy child hood trauma that makes your brain go weird. I'm rambling but anyways. I keep getting feelings of hurt and sadness coming up almost like ptsd it feels like it's still happening all the time and it used to make me split in a mean way but now I split in a sad way. And it feels like maybe I should leave but then it passes and I'm okay again. Idk what to do we're talking about getting married and buying land together but I'm not sure cause when I do split like this it's so heart breaking. And he tells me all the time he was stupid for the way he acted and what he said was wrong and he only said/did it cause he was young and immature and he know what it means to respect me now but I still feel pain. But he hasn't cheated since that day and he's stopped lusting over other women and he really truly is focused on me I just feel so scared still. I'm wanting to dye my hair back not my natural color but I'm scared he won't love me anymore. He said the only thing that will change is the color of my hair but I'm still scared. Does this get easier with age? Should I stay? I love him so much and he makes me smile every day. I'm just having a lot of big emotions and it's weird cause he'll tell me he was wrong and hug me when I cry about him cheating. How do I move on without breaking up with him? I want to marry him but idk if that's just cause he's my fp or if I actually want to. I can never trust my own emotions like ever and I have panic attacks about this often. I used to split so mean but now when I split I'm anxious or sad. When does this balance out? Why is shadow work so hard?

Partner‚Äôs anxiety over news of my BPD,1715649820,"Hi, my partner (28m) and I (24f) have been together for about a year. This past month we found out from my individual therapist that I most-likely have BPD. Things are not nearly as dire as any of the stories we‚Äôve read online, but it‚Äôs still something that needs to be addressed for a long, lasting future together. We are trying to get into couples therapy, but it‚Äôs going to be a few weeks out at least. We‚Äôre having open and productive conversations about everything, but (understandably) he‚Äôs still pretty stressed about it all.

The thing that concerns me, and that I‚Äôm looking for advice on, is that he‚Äôs beginning to convince himself that my feelings for him aren‚Äôt as genuine or unique as he previously thought. His anxieties are telling him that my love and devotion for him have a lot more to do with my disorder than our connection. This is a valid concern, given all we‚Äôve read about bpd idealization online, but I‚Äôm worried about the effect it has on his self-esteem. I still firmly believe that our connection is so special and that he is the best partner anyone could ask for. I do, for the record, understand that nobody is perfect and acknowledge he isn‚Äôt either.

I want to be clear that the issue is not that I worry he is going to think our connection is less special, and then decide to leave me. It seems to be more ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm replaceable and she would love someone else just as much?‚Äù than ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm wrong about how I feel toward her?‚Äù I‚Äôm posting to ask for any advice from partners of pwbpd who have gone through those same feelings. Is there anything I can tell him to reassure him that my love for him is just as real as it he thought before? How have you dealt with the thought that your pwbpd may just be idealizing you? Any general advice to calm his nerves a bit would really help. I hate seeing him so stressed and I want to help however I can.

I am scared of myself. ,1715648420,"I started dating this guy, let's call him Jake. 
Jake is wonderful, he's lovely, i fell so hard for him and so fast, we both instantaneously connected and i genuinely feel like we were made for each other. 

Now there's this other dude. He's almost the complete opposite of Jake, and we're gonna call him Nikki. Nikki and I talked for a little bit, and he took care of me for days when I ran away from home. He became my FP for a while and i was obsessed. We had a good fuck, i felt connected to him, and i wanted to be his girl so badly. But he was emotionally unavailable and even after numerous talks with him about our relationship, we concluded that he wasnt ready for a relationship. Which was fine by me, as long as he still texted me often and showed at least some interest. As time went on he began to play a push and pull game that drove me fucking insane, though i tried not to show it did. 

Now that im publicly dating Jake, he's liked every post ive posted with him. Which is odd, bc he doesnt usually like my stuff. When i texted him and asked him if he was going to a certain concert, he was really dry and sent only one message at a time. Complete switch up. This (of course) triggered my abandonment issues and i felt as if i was losing him, a man that was and maybe still is my FP and i began to panic. 

Jake is so amazing. I dont want to ruin this, but i find myself being more drawn to Nikki. The fact that he has switched up on me RIGHT AFTER he saw me w another dude infuriates me but makes me want him back even more.

i've split with my s/o and am looking for advice on their request on seeing a long-distance friend together,1715644378,"To start, for context, I am the one w/ BPD in our relationship, and I've been feeling unloved by them lately. It comes and goes as a persistent issue, and lately I've been able to identify the issue as a lack of direct communication. I don't feel loved in the ways they show love. I understand they are trying to show love, but it comes off as confusing and indirect so I miss what they're trying to convey very often. I had a breakdown and tried to communicate this, and it resulted in them feeling upset and taking space. For me, this was extremely tumultuous in an already bad mental state. I don't think I've ever quite split for this long with them. We've been taking more or less some space, I told them I am tired of initiating conversations (I'm feeling very burnt out) as I kept initially trying to cater to them in this time.

They messaged today, their best friend who is a long distance friend they never get to see (it's been many years), has a layover tomorrow in our city. My S/O doesn't drive, so this implied my presence to drive them. I asked if they needed a ride and if they wanted me to come with or just pickup/drop off, and when they responded that they want me to come, it frustrated me deeply. We haven't talked at all about the incident from days ago now, we haven't seen each other in person, and the first time we see each other- in my mind- we just have to shove everything away and act happy and normal so we can hang with their bestie. They haven't asked me how I've been at all, it doesn't feel like they give a fucking shit about me, and that they just need me for the favor. I feel extremely unloved and I'm scared of seeing them in person at this point.

I'm. honestly not sure what to do. Do I go? I really don't think I want to but I've been the source of them not meeting up last time the long distance friend was nearby- we planned a whole trip and I ended up canceling due to stress. I think for sure I would offer to drive, I just hate the idea of spending time with them like this right now.

My bestfriend wBPD and I had a falling out and I'm trying to understand his thinking.,1715643702,"So my (27M) roommate/best friend (26M) with BPD have been living together for 3 years now. We've had ups and downs, but most of the time we always bounce back from it. Our last big argument was 8 months ago and it ended with him finding out he had BPD and apologizing for how it affected me.

About two months ago, he randomly became very distant with me. This came 4 days after him telling me how excited he was at how close we are and how I'm his best friend and he's so appreciative of me. He also made significant life changes like quitting drinking, reading self-help and spirituality books, stopped dating, etc. a MAJOR shift from his previous lifestyle.

Two weeks into that, I asked if everything was good and he said yes, but also acknowledged he'd been distant and that he's just been enjoying spending time alone, which I respected. But the following weeks, he would just continually make passive aggressive remarks to me and not anyone else. Then he would start being nice to me right after. He would hangout with all these other friends and not me. Other friends started to pick up on his behavior towards me too.

He would act very close and almost relationship-like one day and then the next day act like he hardly is friends with me. The back-and-forth was a lot to deal with personally so I needed to set boundaries. This basically just meant me not agreeing to everything he wanted to do just to stay on his ""good side"". I still hungout with him, I still invited him places, I didn't treat him any differently and I still thought of him as a best friend.

Last month, he sent me a message reassuring me I didn't do anything wrong and he appreciates me so much. At this point, I decided I had to say something. I confronted him and essentially told him that I understand he's enjoying spending time alone and obviously I support that, but that's not an excuse to be passive aggressive or rude to me. I basically asked him to treat me like a friend consistently and let him know how his behavior has affected me. I even said if I did anything wrong please let me know. He basically flipped it onto me and said I was the most manipulative person he's ever known and that I victimize myself all the time. The conversation ended with him saying he's been looking to move out for awhile (he told me 3 days before he wanted to start touring apartments) and he's going to do so ASAP.

Now, it's been almost a month and we haven't spoken besides in passing. Our mutual friends have tried speaking with him and he shuts them all down saying he doesn't need advice. I have offered to talk it out but he says he doesn't have anything more to say. When were around friends, he still tries to talk to me as if nothing is wrong, but I don't want to engage in small talk unless we talk things out.

He is very into spirituality now and has determined he doesn't need therapy or medication anymore and that he doesn't actually have BPD.

I know I can't do this alone,1715640292,"I have to heal and address these things with compassion for myself and others, and I know it. But every time I try to go through that process alone I only see myself as a problem that needs to be solved and won't ever get better. I can't see myself as a person. I only see the diagnosis and the symptoms and how I treated others. 

On top of all that I end up just hating myself to the point of very bad thoughts and actions. And I stop caring about how I affect other people. Because I'm undeserving of real love so I won't ever find it so trapping someone with me is the only thing I can think of doing. Manipulative and guilt tripping behavior. I don't plan on being alive to sort it out so it doesn't have consequences in my head. 

All conflict feels like bridges burning so I act in ways that damage the relationship because it's already over to me. I can't do anything else because I can't see anything past it. 

And I want to stop. I want to be better. I don't like being this way and I hate it. I really really hate it. But I need someone to hold my hand while I sort through this box of shit I didn't ask for. And if I don't have that I crumble and I can't see the end to the maze, I feel there's nothing outside of it. The extreme thinking patterns are quite literally my only perspective and I hate that too. 

What can I do? I have no one. All of my friends are either blocked or have me blocked or when I ask to hang out they tell me they aren't in the mood and 20 minutes later their story is them hanging out with everyone who won't talk to me. The only person who said they would be their for me won't talk to me unless I'm getting them off and sending images that make me feel like a cheap hole. 

He cheated on me. He selfishly asked me to wait for him and said he wasn't looking for anyone and would consider me first if he did. Then downloaded a dating app and drove 2 hours to someone's house for the night. He was on the phone with me that night. Telling me he loved me. Mind you I gave him an out. I told him I didn't think he wanted that arrangement and he was more than open to leave if he wanted and he said no. He knew it was selfish but he wanted it. 

And I'm so lost. He's 3 hours away and refuses to come here. I've offered him everything. I've offered him my body, I've offered to let him hurt me, use me, comfort me, or whatever else he wanted. But no. I just can't do this anymore.

Feel like I‚Äôm running out of time and a lost cause,1715637788,"What‚Äôs cookin my emotional brothers and sisters. I‚Äôm 20 m and I was only recently diagnosed with BPD like two months ago by my therapist. He told me to do my own research in my own time and see if I could relate to others with the disorder, which I most definitely did and it was an extremely surreal experience. It STILL is surreal and it‚Äôs come with a lot of feelings both good and bad, but honestly mostly bad lmao. 

After learning about the diagnosis I pretty quickly quit yet another job (this time a high paying shipyard) and also texted my high school ex who I haven‚Äôt spoken a single word to in TWO YEARS a massive embarrassing ramble of emotions (she responded as nicely as you can to that sort of thing though thankfully lol). Some weeks later and Im here now hired for yet another job that I‚Äôll probably stay at for a few months then quit, but I want this to end so bad. I‚Äôm so tired and honestly the hope is gone. 

I know I haven‚Äôt been in therapy long, but already my therapist has missed like three meetings and I don‚Äôt know if he can help me even if I did actually meet him every week like I‚Äôm supposed to. How can he help me become better just by talking to me when I‚Äôm this far gone? I‚Äôm thinking about talking to my psychiatrist about trying antipsychotics (especially since I‚Äôve experienced two VERY vivid auditory hallucinations quite recently) but I‚Äôve already tried so many stimulants and anti depressants that have done nothing for me.

 I also read many stories about people with BPD and how they can‚Äôt find love and how they‚Äôre alone and it crushes me. Despite the fact that it‚Äôs been over two fucking years, I still miss and obsess over my ex all the time and since she dumped me it hasn‚Äôt felt like I‚Äôve been living ‚Äúlife‚Äù anymore. It feels like every day I live has been the ‚Äúaftermath‚Äù of that event despite all the times I‚Äôve seriously tried to push her out of my mind with actual HEALTHY distractions over the past two years. 

I feel so alone and unloved and that‚Äôs because I truly believe I am. The people who don‚Äôt hate me I cut from my life anyway subconsciously. I haven‚Äôt been able to connect with any of my family members since I was very young, not because they‚Äôre bad people or anything but just because I feel extremely anxious around all of them, and that definitely includes both my parents who I haven‚Äôt lived with since I was 13. I really only have 3 dickhead guy friends left who I‚Äôve known for a decade, and lately they‚Äôve been unhappy with me too (for good reason). The only person I love and I feel at least remotely loves me back isn‚Äôt actually a person but my cat Walt. The only thing I want in life is a real connection with someone. I WANT to work for it but I can‚Äôt, I always give up or fuck up somewhere down the line. 

I‚Äôm just getting worse and worse. I‚Äôm addicted to everything and my physical health is taking a nose dive too. Binge eating has become a huge problem lately, and I think I‚Äôm starting to get fat which will fucking destroy me since I used to be a fat kid and thinning out was genuinely one of the best things that ever happened to me lmfao. I want to work out from home and get really fit and big which would be extremely helpful for my confidence, but I can‚Äôt even START because I know I will probably just give up like before. Time is flying so fast, probably in part because I haven‚Äôt stopped smoking copious amounts of pot longer than a week in over two years. I feel like I‚Äôm running out of time and even if I do get better or don‚Äôt fucking kill myself this week, I‚Äôll have already wasted so much of my life. I‚Äôm so alone and depressed and tired and I have so many problems I don‚Äôt even know where to begin to even ATTEMPT to try and become happy. 

Idk what any of you can tell me, and again I haven‚Äôt been in therapy for BPD long so really that‚Äôs probably my best bet. If it does help, I hope it starts helping really fucking soon because I think things are really, really bad now.

How hard is it to maintain relationship with a partner having BPD?,1715633802,"I (23M) am in a 4 month relationship with my girlfriend (26F). Although she's not officially diagnosed with BPD, I can notice a couple of BPD symptoms in her such as impulsivity, mood swings and intense emotional responses.

She shows emotional intimacy to me, initiates conversations and is contact with me frequently every day. She even get‚Äôs a bit jealous if a girl follows me on Instagram, is curious to know more about me and is interested in meeting/dating more often. She was the one who suggested getting physical as well.

We‚Äôd a minor dispute 3 days ago and she blocked me on Instagram. The following day, she unblocked me, followed me again and liked my latest post. I didn‚Äôt follow immediately, but she kept contacting and sending romantic messages till I followed her back.

This has happened 3 times in this 4-month relationship already. All due to disagreements on trivial issues. We get irritated quickly, short fuse and unfollow each other. But the resentment is minimal and after just 2 or 3 days, we reconnect due to missing each other.

She broke up with her ex 2 years ago. The final year was rocky and in the on/off mode. She was the one who reached out most of the time to reconcile, but it only got worse. After the break up, she'd depression for almost a year.

It's been a couple of years that she vapes moderately and even occasionally gets stones to mitigate her mood shifts; but she has not taken any medications.

I don‚Äôt know if these temporary cuts signal manipulation, controlling behavior, avoidance, instability and passive-aggressiveness; or are just unimportant blips due to not knowing each other enough and will stop once the boundaries are defined.

Some people have told me these are signs of BPD, while others believe she's clingy and emotionally dependent.

I was wondering what the chance of this relationship to last is. Will this get worse overtime once the honeymoon phase is over?

My jealousy is ruining my relationship. (TW),1715627656,"I have an amazing boyfriend whom I truly love. He is my FP. I get so jealous when he speaks to any other girl to the point where I am ruining the relationship. 

I wanted to avoid speaking to him about it because I knew that I most likely wouldn't handle it well and I was right. Usually when I feel jealous I distance myself so that there is less of a chance that I do something that I will regret. But the topic came up anyway.

I have a female friend who also has BPD and I have a very complicated relationship with her. I want to be her friend but at the same time I hate her guts. Our friendship has been on and off for about 2 years. More recently the friendship ended on bad terms and she said some hurtful things and I of course did not take it well. I hated her and I was very angry because I could not let it go. Recently we're suddenly friends again. I thought that maybe it could work out if we communicate more. I already regret contacting her. She knows all about how jealous I can get. We know A LOT about each other. Our friendship was toxic and competitive.

 Last week we went to a school dance along with my boyfriend (the day we became friends) and I had told her that me and my boyfriend were together before we arrived at the dance. We met up with my boyfriend and we all quickly started talking. She patted him on the shoulder after joking around which is odd since she told me that she hated physical touch, she knew that we were together and from all the time we've been friends she should've gathered that I wouldn't have liked her touching my boyfriend. While we were at the dance I kept having to move to the other side of my boyfriend because she kept walking next to him. I know that it is a stupid thing to be upset about but they were walking really close to each other and there were quite a few times where I was walking behind them and they didn't even notice. I was the third wheel. They also talked a lot which is strange since my friend doesn't usually like talking to people nor finds it easy but she quickly talked about some minor personal things which I think was really odd. 

My boyfriend said that he changed his opinion on her and that she's really cool. It hurt me a lot. I felt that I was being replaced. And I felt so betrayed. I asked him about the whole leaving me out thing and he apologized
 He said that he didn't notice (am I that unimportant?) and that he felt bad for disliking her and thought that since me and her are friends again that he should try to get along with her. 

Later on he texted her to ask for the photos she took that night. He could've asked me. She definitely has his number saved now and it makes me so fucking angry. 

Today he brought it up and asked about me being jealous over my friend. We talked a bit and then he said that I can't get mad at him for talking to my friend which is true but I lost my shit anyway. It didn't matter how many times he reassured me that he only loved me because I still went crazy. I sent him multiple voice messages about it where it is clear that I am on the verge of tears. I was so hurt. It hurt so much. He just wanted to know what was happening. But I felt that he was replacing me and I couldn't stop crying. I couldn't stop thinking about having to walk behind them. I couldn't stop thinking about how much it hurt. 

I did some things that I shouldn't have. Not completely terrible but enough to hurt him too. I just want to be the only one he loves. I already apologized but I am ignoring him because I want him to worry about me (I mentioned suicide) which now that I type out sounds horrible.

How do I cope in the future? I just get so jealous and possessive that I feel it is taking over my life and I can't do anything about it. I trust my boyfriend I really do. I just always have this fear in the back of my mind that I can't get rid of. What do I do?

I just feel that he is all I have. I can't lose him. I genuinely feel that there isn't anything I can do to fix the jealousy problem. My only hope is that I find a way to deal with it better because I truly do not wish any harm upon him.

Forcing myself to join BPD group therapy- how to change my very negative attitude about it?,1715625949,"I knew a BPD group would be great for me, so I joined one and will be starting tomorrow. 

The problem is that I have an extremely negative attitude about it and don't want to do it. I already don't like the group leader. Plus, the group is a part of a substance use facility, so there is a bunch of other rules I have to follow even though I don't have a substance use problem. 

For excample, I can't drink or do any drugs ever. I'm not following this rule though because I don't have a problem with substances (I only do them maybe 2 a month) and I do them responsibly. I don't see why I need to stop.

I'm also trying to really enjoy life more and make up for lost time and experiences I've missed out on. I'm getting married soon and have a lot of other fun things going on this year, some of which include drinking or occassionally drugs. I'd be extremely upset to not be able to do these things just because of a support group. 

To make things worse, they can drug test me if they think I'm doing some kind of substance. I'm going to refuse to do a drug test because they have to watch me pee and will absolutly flip my shit if that happens so I'm just not going to do that. However, this will likely result in me being kicked out. 

It just feels like I'm be punished and viewed as a bad person who can't make responsible decisions. 

The threat that I could be kicked out at any moment also looms over my head and, as you can imagine, for somebody who has abandonment and rejection issues, this isn't going to feel like a safe enviroment. It doesn't help that I have to hide that I occasionally drink or use drugs (just weed 98% of the time). 

I just don't know how to change my very negative attitude about it. It doesn't feel like I'm joining a group to better myself, but more like I'm being punished and that I need to be baby sat to make sure I'm living my life by somebody else's rules.

Advice for breaking up with someone while having BPD,1715625795,"I‚Äôm just here looking for advice on breaking up with someone when you are the one who has BPD.

He said he loves me very much, and these were the best months of his life, but he doesn't want constant fights or to be limited by my fears and jealousy.

BPD and Substance Abuse - a Request For Practical Words of Advice,1715618757,"Hi all, 

  
I (29m) am hoping to tap into some of the experiences of those within this sub. For some context, I have for a long time struggled with abusing substances as a means of emotionally regulating myself and as a response to trauma. I have always done so since about the age of 14. What I have learned recently through a BPD diagnosis is that I use most frequently whenever I come across a particular difficult emotion or feeling - something that occurs quite often for me.

This has got to the point where it is actually aggravating my symptoms and also causing some issues in my life. I'm managing to keep a good job, but I can only wonder how long for if I continue to engage in these behaviors. 

  
One significant issue is that I feel quite certain that what I am going through is less like what we traditionally might view as an addiction, and more so a soothing behaviour - although I am no expert. 



My question to you fine folks is this - how did you manage to avoid substance abuse whilst dealing with BPD?

Also, some ppl with ASPD tend to make fun of BPD.

How can I deal with my bpd bfs outbursts? ,1715608169,"

Hi there, 

Been with my boyfriend now 2 years and we were friends before that for 5 years. Things are good most of the time, besides his occasional emotional outbursts. 
For some context, I have autism myself and he recently got his diagnosis of bpd 6 months ago. 

In the last 2 years he has ‚Äúbroken up‚Äù with me 2 times, what usually happens is he gets highly emotional about some subject, gets angry, blames me for imaginary things and leaves for 2 weeks. He comes back, apologizes and tries to fix things. 

The last time this happened was 4 months ago, and it was quite an ugly break up. I had to call his primary doctor because he was screaming that he wanted to end his life, after his doctor came to our home to check on him, he left again. 

Right after he left, he texted me he told me he‚Äôs going on vacation with his family for 3 weeks and he‚Äôs going to get drunk and have sex with every woman he sees. 

He had me blocked for about a week, then came back again. Wanted to talk things out. And actually since then things had been better than ever before. 


But now he left to go on that vacation with his family and last night he was suddenly not on his phone for several hours (when the rest of the whole vacation he had been texting every hour) I texted him that i was going to go to sleep and hope I could speak tomorrow morning. 


He texted me he was out on a walk with his brother and then he started drunk calling me, I picked up the first time and he was in some loud bar, he sounded very drunk. I texted him that I heard what was going on and it made me feel uncomfortable and if he could please let me know in the morning what‚Äôs going on. 

He blew up at me, cursing, name calling and told me to just block him and get this shit over with. I didn‚Äôt block him.

I left him be for the night and have yet to text him, but I‚Äôm really not sure what to do. 

How can I deal with this and what‚Äôs the best actions to take when he gets like this? 

I hope somebody can help and sorry for the long read

I got my diagnosis of bpd around the time we had first started dating which was around the age of 14. he has cheated on me so much to the point where i think the number would be in the 20s at this point (texting/sexting, meeting, getting with other girls). I‚Äôve been debating on posting this since i use a similar username on multiple other platforms and i‚Äôm afraid of him finding this. 

I‚Äôve been finding it extremely hard to move on. I‚Äôm just not attracted to other people, sexually, romantically and physically. I don‚Äôt see other people as attractive and lack interest in meeting new people. I go out with friends every weekend and i always have men complimenting me, asking for my socials and trying to stick around with me for the night but i just cannot find it in me to be interested. It feels wrong and in a way it feels like even if we‚Äôre not together like im being disloyal to my ex. He‚Äôs made it his point to make me feel like no matter what, i will always belong to him and i hate it. 

Im always the one that breaks it off with him and he‚Äôs always the one that comes back. 
Everytime i break it off it‚Äôs due to lack of attention from him and his obsession with other women. It‚Äôs as if cheating is some sort of fetish to him. He loves to make me feel alone and insecure and then just come back and love bombs me out of the blue.

Need help with trying not to form a codependent relationship,1715599434,"Hello everyone!  I would just like to ask if there's any way for you guys to recognize an upcoming codependent relationship and redirect it to a healthier one?

Boundaries! I don't owe anybody on the street to let them being able to talk to me and harass me!,1715598299,"
Boundaries! I don't owe anybody on the street to let them being able to talk to me and harass me!

went out the day before to get food over the weekend was keep getting unwanted attention and harassment on the street, I woke up today with massive migraine and back pain from having panic attacks of being fighting mode.

People warned me Totthengam Is horrible possible the worst part for sexual harassment. They were exactly right. I haven't even left the street corner and it has already been so much harassment and abuse.

During last summer, every single therapy session I went to was me complaining about getting harassed by ranmdoms on the street. I was constantly angry and in fighting mode. So I could never relax doesn't matter how many coffees I have. My therapist said it's lack of boundaries. Which I agree. Really lack of boundaries/ relationships/ society function due to panic and anxiety. I was so angry and agitated from all the men trying to talk to me by making compliments on how I look or what I do to get so ""fit"", I just awkwardly smile but they would not leave me alone. It is so stressful and because I have complex ptsd I really can't handle this kind of stress and social anxiety now. I'm not sure if it's just a London thing or it's because I'm unwell now that I have sexual harassment constantly, I don't remember ever experienced this when I was younger.

Also it's because I'm east Asian, traditional we are so polite and don't want to be rude, so we are seen as easily pushover. The stereotype is all correct. I'm also one of them who don't know how to say no. When I do say no is when I get so overloaded with anger I would respond with a violent physical fight and just want to carry weapon to go out or I would not go out at all.

I would get so anxious on the street or be seen in public because people look at me, and I would start to act really anxious and nervous and start to do yoga and circus to calm down, and then people would stare at me even more

I am so tired and stressed. I can't function in a society alone in the street walking around unless I have a big dog or a man protecting me. Unfortunately I don't have them. I am serious considering talking to a hospital to get permission to get a guide dog so people on the street can leave me alone! And I am not even a dog person I love cats.

When I went out to get food so many men tried to talk to me, I'm not dressed in any way that's not appropriate for the weather. The more these people start to harass me because how I look or because I dare to expose skin to get some sunlight for depression treatment the more angry I get, and the more I just want to strip naked in public because it's a revenge anger of mine. I hate it when people in public shame me for how I look. I just have an overwhelming urge to go fully nude in public and welcome all the harassment and heal the shame

I'm aware perhaps other women can deal with it better than I do because they are not suffering from the same long term condition as I do. I was told just say no no no like a broken record or say please leave me alone you are making me really uncomfortable and violated. I think it's because I'm Chinese and in our culture we don't confront people like that it's seen as rude so I have a lot of trouble functioning in western society, in the street where the predators are everywhere.

I get into survival mode as if I have to fight predators in the concrete jungle in London when I go on the streets. I can't imagine if I take the public transportation alone now how bad it can get in London.

Also the police dont have th√© resources to take sexual harassment and assault seriously. The previous perpetrator on the bus was never caught and the police keeps asking for my DNA which I have reservations to give due to data privacy concerns.

I am so tired of living like this I just want to pack up and move to somewhere isolated or with a smaller community where I can be left alone with no stress triggers. I noticed with my condition I cannot handle any emotional turbulence and I get overwhelmed easily with anger and overstimulation.

I know it's expected to be treated like this when you are weirdly behaved and dressed and can't fit into society norm.

The problem is she seems to be telling me I should or shouldn't be friends with certain people she either 1. knows personally or 2. knows of based on things I said when I wasn't doing so well

I miss my ex girlfriend ,1715581628,"She gave me someone to be and loved me unconditionally for being what she saw I was. We were kids, meet in middle school, dating in high school and my senior year was the last I‚Äôd see of her‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve tried finding something similar to what I had with her but no one compares. She was so forceful with her love, it was so addictive. I never really felt loved growing up in an unstable household. But she gave me this level of love that I‚Äôd never experienced and I was so desperate to keep it.

Unfortunately negative feelings arose. I started to feel as if I wasn‚Äôt enough for her, that I couldn‚Äôt satisfy her (especially sexually), and I wasn‚Äôt what she thought I was. And another problem I had was nodding my head and saying yes to any thing she asked. In my mind saying no was going to risk our relationship and I couldn‚Äôt do that.

BUT THEN I PUSHED HER AWAY LIKE I DO WITH EVERYONE.

I broke up with her after not being able to handle a poly relationship with her. Then we had a spark again the fall of my senior year and I almost got back with her. But I drove her home that night, walked her to her door, told her I couldn‚Äôt continue this kiss and touch game we had going, and that I wasn‚Äôt taking her to prom. And that‚Äôs the last I really spoke to her.

She left me a letter. I never read it. I let my friend read it and let her determine if I really needed those words. She disposed of the letter.

I‚Äôm going into my Sophomore year of college now and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her. I still crave the affection I felt from her. The late calls that I‚Äôd spend pacing in my bedroom with the biggest smile on my face, hearing her beautiful voice on the other line. And god fucking Christ, I miss holding her and kissing her, her laugh! Fuck this! 

I wish I knew what to do! Part of me wants to just drive over to her house and break down at her feet and let her kill me there. But no! My cowedly self is left driving down her neighborhood in the middle of the night and reading our old snap chat logs before being spent into a spiral with shame and regret.

I fucked it up. I‚Äôm the one who didn‚Äôt set boundaries. I‚Äôm the one who lied if it made her happy. My whole goal was to to make sure she was happy at any cost. The cost of my time, money, energy, emotional support, changes of my character, I‚Äôd do it all for her, she was worth it.  But it just made me collapse as parts of myself start to fight back and I was left in a horrible state of cognitive dissonance.

But I have severe anxiety, I have a hard time doing anything on my own, and I mirror people. 

So, if other people are spontaneous (usually others I meet with BPD or Bipolar.) I am a force to be wreck-in with. I am spontaneous, I spend money, I get so drunk and/or I do drugs. While still playing the mom and taking care of them to the best of my ability. In this scenario I am wild and outgoing, anxiety is nearly nonexistent. 

But if the other person is calm, of sound mind in some sort of way, then I am calm and collected and I have this need to take care of them and make sure their mental health is considered. In this scenario I am outgoing, I feel like I have to be to take care of those I‚Äôm with. 

The thing is, someone in my life I‚Äôve recently met IS that first person, and I want to do badly ruin my life now. It‚Äôs like her sheer presence brings me so much happiness and I want to go off the rails with her. But also, that isn‚Äôt necessarily an option.

Now, i know these people are angry and hurt by their experiences. I can‚Äôt deny that there are some awful people out there, and i can unfortunately admit that even i have been awful to those i care about. I wouldn‚Äôt blame a lot of people who have been around me for joining a group similar to this one i‚Äôm in and being equally as cruel about me. 

But god it sucks to see it all. I know i should have left the second i realised i wasn‚Äôt going to find any advice for people actually still in relationships. From the description it sounded like the perfect place for what i needed. But the second i got there, it was like my heart was being torn from my chest. 

Reading all those opinions of us, saying how we‚Äôre toxic and evil and undeserving of love. Seeing just how many people agree with those ideas. Seeing how many people just say the same things over and over again. Telling people to leave relationships because we‚Äôll never change we‚Äôll never make them happy and we‚Äôll just fuck their lives up. 

Is it all true? Is that all we do? Ruin people‚Äôs lives? Or are these just angry, hurting people just venting about their experiences? I‚Äôd like to hope it‚Äôs the second but honestly when you see thousands of comments and posts about how no one with bpd could ever be a good person to have in your life you start to believe it. 

I can‚Äôt get those posts and comments out of my head. Every interaction i have now i take it back to that group. I imagine seeing one of those gut wrenching posts about me, about what i‚Äôve done.

Obsession? FP? Something unrelated to BPD? ,1715571519,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôve been trying to process some emotions lately‚Ä¶ and for like a year now about a specific person. I‚Äôm 25 (f) and have been very (like very very) into my older professor/advisor for quite some time. 

****huge note**** I am SUPER aware that not only is this inappropriate and wrong for many reasons, he is also married and easily twice my age**** he has never reciprocated******

I‚Äôll call the professor M. We first met around Covid for some virtual advising and hit it off immediately. I really appreciate him for making a tough time easier on me. Once classes opened back up I took a semester and we chatted a normal amount for a student and advisor. When it came time to setting up the following semester, it just so happened that he would be teaching a class I needed and wanted to take. 


I‚Äôm unsure if it was his passion, enthusiasm, laid back energy, kindness, intrigue, etc but something during that class caused me to develop a MAJOR crush on him. I told my friends but kept it to myself otherwise. The class just so happens to be a hyper fixation/passion of mine, as well as my literal major. We got on super well, chatted each day after class, tossed around theories in the field, talked about publishing‚Äôs we had found, made jokes and talked about minor personal anecdotes sprinkled throughout. By the end of the semester I was pretty much ‚Äúin love with him‚Äù. 

I wrote him a really nice sincere note on my final exam saying that I appreciated the entire experience of the class and am looking forward to the next semester, nothing mushy or obsessive. In order to allow me to tack on a minor and graduate within a year he overrode a bunch of prereq‚Äôs for me so I could take his class specifically that met multiple degree requirements. 

That was something I may have ran with mentally and thought was special even if I rationally know it probably wasn‚Äôt. Next semester is here (current) and we‚Äôve maintained a sort of ‚Äúbuddy buddy‚Äù rapport, and after class chats, etc. 

As I briefly mentioned above, he is exactly or just over double my age, has at least one child in my age group, is seemingly happily married (doesn‚Äôt wear a ring as a friend pointed out), and is my professor. And advisor! 

I talk about him with anyone and tell them ‚Äúomg I‚Äôm so in love w him‚Äù and they usually think I‚Äôm joking. I‚Äôve read lots of his published works. I‚Äôve taken interest in his specialization. I also happen to find him attractive, more than just physically. He has a very calming and safe energy where nothing is too drastic or traumatic and it‚Äôs so nice to be around considering my history with people who were so intense. 

I‚Äôve cried about the fact that I know it‚Äôs never gonna happen, hated myself for being young or ugly or not smart enough or skinny enough, as if any of this would change anything. I hope this isn‚Äôt too much info but I‚Äôve definitely thought about him while *-* pretty much exclusively. 

I find myself knowing in my actual brain that this is far fetched, wrong, unlikely if not impossible, and just silly but I can‚Äôt help but think of him like a school girl crush. But maybe a bit too obsessive. I tried to be pretty straight forward but can be a little more open if it helps. 

I‚Äôm just curious if this is sounding like an obsession or an FP situation since I genuinely feel pain and sadness when I realize we aren‚Äôt real or close or eve going to be anything more. Or if this is just me falling for someone who finally makes me feel safe but also encourages and shared my passions.

Somewhat proud of myself,1715568777,"TLDR
For the first time in my life I managed to stay silent and not get actively angry when we got put down and ignored. I'm quite proud.


A lot of my life I've been a very angry person, everything has been enraged me and I used to tend to rant a lot whenever I was enraged. I've seen psychologists and been on anti depressants most of my life and they've somewhat reduced the anger but I've always had an impulse issue and reacted before thinking. 

I've been seeing a psychologist for about a year now and on and off meds (currently off for reasons) 

Yesterday at my mother in law's house for mother's Day my husband kept trying to talk about his new job. His sister kept being rude by talking over him, undermining him, making snide comments and interrupting him constantly and usually this would make me visibly react and make rude angry comments back but I somehow even without my medications managed to ignore it and keep my mouth shut.

I've found more and more recently I'll try to walk away from situations that make me angry or not comment probably for the first time in my entire life. This is while not even taking my antidepressants. 

Instead I talked to my husband afterwards about how we're both trying to work on ourselves and need people around who are going to lift us up not try to tear us down.

I'm not really sure what's caused the sudden change now in my life as opposed to other times I've tried but I'm quite proud of myself for ignoring the snide comments our way. ",Successful_Sample209,,FALSE,1cqp292,5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1cqp292/somewhat_proud_of_myself/
Weird mood tonight. ,1715568762,"Any advice or just words of understanding and support would be helpful. 

I'm having a rough night. My partner has been really supportive. Left me alone for a bit like I usually want then asked me how I was feeling and if I wanted to talk about it. 

I told them, not good, yeah I want to talk about it. 

Then I'm pretty sure I disassociated because the next thing I knew my partner was telling me they were leaving the room to go do one of their hobbies and would be back later. 

I don't feel like any time passed since I said I wasn't doing good and wanted to talk about it but I know for a fact I disassociate when I'm struggling so I'm presuming that's what has happened. 

Now I feel so lonely and ignored and I don't want to talk to my partner about anything anymore. I know this is my BPD, it's a common symptom I get and I'm so angry at myself for not just being able to tell my partner what's going on and how I'm feeling. 

I wonder how much time passed, did we even talk or did I just shut down for an hour then my partner decided to live their life as normal like we've discussed they should do a million times before. If that's what happened then why do I feel so damn sure I asked for help and they ignored me even though they've never ignored my need for help in the past but emotionally right now all I can think about is how I said I want to talk about it and they responded by leaving the room for a hobby.

Who else has trouble saying no?,1715561020,"Warning: sex/bdsm talk, non explicit 

I am looking for support/suggestions if you have them. 

Like many of you, I usually tend to refer to myself as hypersexual. Most of the time I want sex all of the time, back to back, inconvenient times, rough/kinky. I‚Äôm in a bdsm dynamic with my partner and he is also hypersexual. However lately I‚Äôve found myself just emotionally feeling like absolute shit. Mood swings worse than ever, stressed all the time. Usually I turn to sex to help alleviate stress and my partner knows this and has been initiating, will offer I can come have a quickie before work or something but despite me not wanting to, I feel like since I‚Äôm normally so hypersexual just can‚Äôt say no? I know it‚Äôs not the most rational and I think my bf would be okay with me not wanting to but I‚Äôm scared. 

 My ex used coercion to get me to sleep with him when I was tired and didn‚Äôt feel like it. Saying if I didn‚Äôt want to sleep with him I should just go home after I drove him home and just wanted to cuddle between school and work. That made me end up saying yes even when I didn‚Äôt want to, I would usually end up feeling like shit and crying alone afterwards. Now I‚Äôm noticing the same pattern of saying yes when I don‚Äôt want to and feeling bad despite my current bf actually caring about consent. Some part of my brain tells me that since he‚Äôs hypersexual too if I don‚Äôt want to sleep with him for a week or so and he‚Äôs said he needs sex usually 3-4 times a week to feel satisfied that he‚Äôll just go get it elsewhere. I know it‚Äôs not rational but I can‚Äôt get past it. I keep doing it anyways and feeling bad and idk what to do. It‚Äôs hard when he feels good after and I don‚Äôt want to tell him I don‚Äôt.

how many more disturbingly relatable esoteric truths do we have left in us? ,1715568266,"I saw a meme posted on backfromtheborderline on instagram with a guy with bloody eyes and the text ‚ÄúIdk how many disturbingly relatable esoteric truths I got left in me‚Äù and it made me laugh but also made me think a lot. Im kind of coming out of a months-long streak of random depressive episodes of living in my own head, overexaggerating negative emotions and escaping as often as possible through relief (mostly through binge watching SATC on Netflix and a lot of maladaptive daydreaming). I was honestly taking a sense of pride in being able to live in my head that I can only describe now as dangerous. 

I was listening to a podcast that caused me to examine where/when I started feeling so stuck. And after literally writing it down, it suddenly grounded me and reminded me I was real, I guess ? And after a few moments of euphoria and just feeling happy to be alive, I calmed down. But the fact that I was in such a impressionable state for so long without realizing it is scary to me. Like I couldnt see my way out. And I just started to question and honestly abandon all of the things I worked so hard to stabilize (stopped therapy, stopped working out, stopped journaling, etc) To say I was on a slippery slope is probably an understatement. 
 I feel like Ive had this realization before of the importance of finding things to ground me and sticking to them in spite of how I may feel, but it was like I was so caught up in my own mind, I guess I forgot. The only way I could describe my state of being is just foggy. Like everything felt like it had this fog in the way. 

Ive taken up the theory that myself and others with BPD are definitely in tune with some spiritual part of ourselves that wants more out of this life that we are faced with. And not to rationalize suffering for suffering‚Äôs sake but sometimes it feels like that type of spiritual knowing comes with so much pain and sadness.

Im curious from others in this group. How many ‚Äúmajor‚Äù realizations/epiphanies have you experienced in this life?

.
Of note: I'm engaged and non-monogamous.

Two weeks ago, I met someone through a threesome with my really good friend. My friend (Z) and the third (S) were close, but had an unrelated falling out. I continued seeing S after the falling out with Z's blessing, but it still felt wrong. 

I am also engaged to D. D and I have a pretty tame/infrequent sex life. I enjoy what we do, but I also have a lot of sexual trauma, and have battled with really severe sex addiction in the past. This has caused conflict between us in the past with no easy answer. I also know that seeing me spend days hooking up with S bothered D a bit. 

S and I had *incredible* sexual chemistry. The kind of experiences you think of for years after. We explored a lot of mutual kinks that are a bit fringe and niche. It was absolutely amazing. We also started being more casually intimate --cuddling, going on walks, pda, etc. It was definitely never headed to dating/a relationship, but the it was a weirdly romantic time. The problem is, S *reaaallllyyy* sucks as a person. Arrogant, sexist, inappropriately pervy, and a lot of other things. I realized after the first time that we hooked up alone that I wasn't the biggest fan of them, but became absolutely infatuated with them. With their touch and the things they did. 

I started to neglect things I need to do in a very short time frame. I would linger at S's and try to block out the world as they talked nonstop about the most boring/annoying things.

Girl 1# immediately said she is gonna be with girl 2# in a room.
And im like ""oh okay. Thats fine. No problem. I can ask girl 3# to be in a room with her.""

Girl #3 asks the other girls if she can be in a triple room with them.

Oh.

Idk what to do now, since i already have a tendency to block people in an episode and then follow them back shamefully after i calmed down and i dont know what to tell them if they ask why did i blocked them.

I‚Äôm a therapist who works with clients with BPD and has had many close relationships with people with BPD. Here‚Äôs how I understand it ‚Äî is it accurate?,1716182932,"Hi. I‚Äôm a therapist who works often with Cluster B PDs, but by far the most frequently with BPD. I also have had several close friends and family diagnosed with the same. It‚Äôs very important to me that my clients feel (and are) accurately understood and seen, and I wanted to check in with this community to see how y‚Äôall feel about my current understanding of BPD, and how people might respond if their therapist presented a similar framework or analogy to at least partially describe your experience. I recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all experience or metaphor that fully encapsulates the infinite complexities and nuances of each individual; I just wanted to check in and see if people generally feel like I‚Äôm on the right track.


In my grad program (Clinical Mental Health Counseling), we were taught that there‚Äôs typically a ‚Äúformula‚Äù for BPD that involves two specific ingredients, whether they rise to the threshold of trauma or not: Emotion dysregulation + an invalidating environment. I really appreciate this approach because it covers severe abuse and neglect, but also extends to families that are relatively ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and well-adjusted [EDIT: several people have rightly pointed out that I misspoke here. It would be more accurate to say that these families see themselves as well-adjusted, but actually have patterns of emotional neglect and dysfunction]‚Äî but not intrinsically equipped to effectively navigate the extreme distress and dysfunction of something like genetically-predisposed BPD.

If a person who is predisposed to BPD grows up in a fairly dysfunctional-but-culturally-normalized family and (understandably, appropriately) internalizes the resulting adversity and rejection as trauma, the stability and general state of seeming wellbeing of everyone else in that family system is inherently invalidating. Everyone around them appears to be able to become a healthy, happy, and solid individual in that same environment, and yet they aren‚Äôt. Everyone else in the immediate family experiences emotions fundamentally differently (and often maintain their external stability by repressing their emotions rather than healthily working theough th) ‚Äî not through any malice, intentional gaslighting/manipulation, or glaringly obvious neglect, but because their brains, nervous systems, and genes are wired differently and they have success with repressing their negative emotions ‚Äî and this means that a person predisposed to BPD experiences feeling continually invalidated, gaslit, minimized, and dismissed for the instability and volatility of their own emotions and experiences. There‚Äôs an emptiness that has no obvious external root or source, but that *hurts* insistently, every day, regardless of the lack of circumstances to explain it.

I often think of BPD as the emotional equivalent of a tooth with weak enamel that easily chips and quickly exposes the root/nerve with no insulation. There‚Äôs profound ‚Äòtemperature sensitivity‚Äô in the preoccupation with abandonment ‚Äî reading extremes of affection and rejection into neutral or often minor interactions/conflicts; and there‚Äôs extreme ‚Äòpressure sensitivity‚Äô in their intolerance for genuine closeness with others before the intensity of the proximity causes overwhelming pain. Such an uninsulated tooth/nerve experiences extreme pain even when trying to perform basic functions (chewing normal foods/navigating day-to-day life and relationships) and experiences intolerable suffering when exposed to genuine extremes (biting into ice cream or eating hard and crunchy food/experiencing deep rejection or encountering significant resistance/rigidity in their environment). This framework helps me better understand pwBPD, and it helps me balance profound compassion with accountability (if a tooth is that compromised, we need to avoid chewing with it until we can implement external supports and build that insulation back up!). I would love to hear if this analogy is helpful to anyone but myself, though.


Edit: I‚Äôve tweaked the wording in some areas in response to feedback and after thinking a bit more carefully about how to articulate what I‚Äôm getting at. This has already been extremely helpful for me and I so appreciate y‚Äôall for taking the time to read and share your feedback. Thank you.

Until this morning, I was in a happy relationship with someone, but then I woke up (my sleep cycle is messed up, I know) to read a text from my (ex?) boyfriend saying that he thinks it's better if we're just friends.
 
These past few days have been a bit awkward, yes, but for external factors. Nothing to do with us as a couple.
If fact, last night before he went to bed, we had a nice talk about us and about what was going on and we solved (or so I thought) things and agreed these external factors weren't going to grt between us. 

He is aware that I have bpd and since he's a therapist he always knew how to treat me and what to say etc. 

I don't really understand why he would want to suddenly break up with me just like that. I'm honestly devastated and have been crying non-stop all day. I don't understand and everything just hurts so much. 
I don't resent or hate him (I'm not the ""typical"" borderline [you kkow how people think we are/stereotype us] that gets angry, I just always get really depressed). 

This is kind of what I (37F btw) always feared that it would happen (abandonment, once again) and I don't really know how to deal with this.

Swingers club have been great - having a night out partying with fun people in your underwear and hopefully having some fantastic sex with one or more of them? Ideal, at least if I'm in the mood for lots of people.

But once I branch out into private meets, it typically goes one of two ways - there's no connection, we just have sex (usually fun sex) and move on without seeing each other again, but I feel a bit empty. Or we do have some kind of connection, have a great time and meet up again, which means I get attached, develop feelings, and then get rejected because they're not looking for a relationship - or just don't want one with me.

Please tell me I made the right choice having an abortion and that I could never have handled or given my baby everything because of my BPD,1715860520,"I have diagnosed BPD and ADD, my ex has bipolar and ADD (diagnosed as well).

I always without fail took the pill, but my ex never used protection so we just got very very unlucky falling pregnant.

He instantly lost his shit. Fell into depression. Started ignoring me. Telling me he can't have this baby.

I never wanted kids because of my childhood trauma but once I found out I was pregnant I guess hormones kicked in and I loved the baby. I saw it on ultrasounds and it was measuring perfect. For once I took proper care of my body and health. For my baby. All my actions pointed to me wanting to keep it.

However with my ex desperate for an abortion and the moral window closing soon (if I got an abortion I'd want it before 8 weeks - no nervous system on brain activity yet, so it would not feel or be aware of anything) things were getting super tense.

My ex threatened suicide. He said he would leave me and never want to see our child. He already abandoned another child (that he told me his ex kept from him, but during my pregnancy admitted to never wanting), so I knew he was capable of that.

When his bipolar gets bad he's usually off the rails getting into debt and bouts on unemployment, so I knew financially he'd contribute next to nothing. (he pays his ex 100/150 a month)

I asked my family if they would support me (let me live there for the first few months with baby) and they basically said no. Then I thought about it and hated myself for wanting to bring my baby into the lives of the people who traumatised me.

But I had no one else. I struggle with codependency like my mom so I was unhealthily attached to my ex and had no support system whatsoever.

I got a lot of counselling from unwanted/unplanned pregnancy therapists but it always came down to its up to you, if you want it, keep it.

I wanted to keep it so badly but how could I, faced with reality:

- I have BPD. I'm easily overstimulated and completely shut down when I am. Frequently fall into depression and suicidal ideation where I'm unable to function for days. I can barely take care of myself. I don't have life skills, I cannot teach a child how to regulate themselves. I'd resent them depending on me probably.

- I'm codependent and would probably repeat the same dynamics with my child that my mother did with me. Enmeshment. Emotional dependence. Traumatising my child for life even though I'd love it with all my heart.

- my ex has severe mental illness and ADD like me (what is the genetic element in this? Would our baby be more likely to suffer from mental illness/disability as well)

- no support system whatsoever.... Literally no one except my mentally ill parents. I'm not stable either. How am I going to show up for my child in the best way every single day? As much as I told myself I'd die for my child and do it all, that is wishful thinking and unrealistic and unfair.

- despite many moms doing it alone on purpose the thought of my child not having a dad, knowing that they were abandoned, and me not having a partner to support me, it felt wrong. Like every child deserves two loving parents.

- I'd have to get off my meds because they weren't pregnancy safe. I'm on an extremely high dose so without it who knows what would happen to me on different/no meds. 

I had the abortion because in my mind love was simply not enough.

Afterwards my ex cheated, threw me out and made me homeless, I was hospitalized for an od because I just couldn't handle living anymore.

My 'due date' is coming up and I am still so incredibly sad, grieving. People tell me the baby was 'nothing' yet. But it was everything to me. My whole heart. Something more than me. I feel so sorry. Guilty. Curious how it would have been. Wishing I could have been enough.

How To Cope With BPD Stigma?,1715828459,"Hi, everyone. I've been having a rough week. I follow some BPD pages for education & support, & I have a habit of reading the comments, which are often full of hate. But I've fallen into a digital self-harm rabbit hole where I knowingly go on BPD hate subs & read through posts & comments.

The stigma is paralyzing, & reading these types of comments is jeopardizing my recovery. It doesn't help, either, that Reddit & similar sites have a massive hate boner for people with personality disorders- Hence why I only have this account for asking around on forums when I can't find what I'm looking for elsewhere, & I don't use it very often. 

How do I stop reading comments & clicking on hate subs? And most importantly, how can I cope with stigma & demonization when I do come across it? The only thing I've really seen suggested is radical acceptance, & that's easier said than done here.

Social media worsens Identity Disturbance - Get off them,1715828159,"I was reflecting on my thoughts and behavior this morning. I found dynamic social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube significantly worsen identity disturbance. 

Particularly if you're constantly watching self-improvement and growth stuff. BPD brains negatively frame stuff. Instead of learning, it makes you feel like a failure. It creates FOMO and distorts your values.

I experimented with going off social media completely to observe the stability of my thoughts and values for 2 weeks or so. I could quickly feel the stability and calmer. 

Then I got recently occupied again. I could feel self-harming negative thoughts getting stronger immediately.

So unless you have successfully fixed BPD default negative thoughts on envy and self-worth using DBT and mindfulness for a consecutive period, Get off social media. 

Especially for people who are early in their treatment. I promise this change only will significantly improve your life. ",Mother-Focus-84,,FALSE,1ct32jo,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1ct32jo/social_media_worsens_identity_disturbance_get_off/

is my bestfriend avoiding me or am i being paranoid?,1715825337,"I (f18) moved to another country with my bestfriend (f18) a year ago to study. We‚Äôre not in the same college but live 10/15 minutes away from eachother. We used to see eachother a lot but then the finals came and we haven‚Äôt seen eachother in almost a month and a half. I‚Äôve asked her to hangout a lot of times but she‚Äôs always too busy. She‚Äôs in law school so i didn‚Äôt take it personally but she does make time to see her boyfriend every weekend with no exception and i see in her stories that her study group (her friends from her school) go to her house 2/3 times a week.
I‚Äôve had an episode this week and felt really alone but i knew she couldn‚Äôt be here for me so i had to call my ex-boyfriend because i was scared of what i could do to myself. But when she got in an argument with her boyfriend yesterday night i stayed up all night comforting her because she was worried and very sad.
We were supposed to see each-other this weekend but my flight got pushed so i‚Äôm going back home this weekend. I asked her if we could see eachother tonight for a drink because she finished her last final this morning but she said she was going to have a drink with her friend from college at her house.

"Boyfriend said I was itching to start an argument when I was calm, but that itself made me start",1715823389,"Basically we were texting normally and he wasn‚Äôt his usual self texting, as you notice people‚Äôs patterns, he didn‚Äôt tell me ‚ÄúI miss you too‚Äù like he usually does, he said ‚Äúmiss U2‚Äù and all I did was show proof from past messages of him saying ‚ÄúI miss you too darling‚Äù, literally like this. I was being light and loving, telling him ‚Äúoh maybe I‚Äôm overthinking but you normally say it like this ü•π‚Äù and showed him examples as well as continuing other texts in a loving manner

He said ‚Äúidc‚Äù ‚Äúur itching to start an argument‚Äù but I was fully calm and lightly having a conversation and being loving with other texts too. But him saying I‚Äôm ‚Äúitching‚Äù set me off.

He‚Äôs so set on being right and talking for how I feel but it‚Äôs so wrong

I‚Äôm so irritated rn only because of that assumption and he said ‚Äúsee I was right‚Äù after I reacted being upset and annoyed by him saying I‚Äôm ‚Äúitching to start an argument‚Äù
